We at Vth Season are extremely proud of the work Big Star has put in to release such a masterpiece. We are confident music lovers and his fans will gravitate towards Closer and make it a radio chart topping single,” expresses Raphael Benza of Vth Season. Closer is a modern-day love song inspired by the current space that Big Star is in, in-terms of his Love life. It is a dedication and appreciation from the creative musical genius to his current lover and all women around the world during this month of love, commemorating their presence and impact they have in our lives. “I realised that we as South African rappers are afraid to make emotional music, honest love songs. So I created this piece to appreciate the woman in my life and just shed light on a positive love story and celebrate a new love, shares Big Star. Big Star further adds: “Initially the song was written to an acoustic guitar and Tazzy built around it and created a masterpiece. This song is for everybody! Very cross over in the sound but also celebrates our home sounds with the guitar lines at the end of the song.”On Closer, Big Star keeps the sound very minimalistic using an acoustic guitar as the main instrument, making sure that the attention of the listener gravitates more to the message of the song.  Big Star’s artistry and vocal ability comes across strongly on Closer and proves that Big Star is not just a Hip Hop musician but a true artist with diverse capabilities and is coming into his own with his sound.  With a feel-good element reminiscent of his My Year single release, which went on to top numerous radio charts including the 5FM Top 30 chart; Big Star’s Closer is the perfect cross over track that will appeal to the country at large. - Supplied
