Sibiya was the man of the moment in 2015, scoring the winning goal in the 93rd and last minute of their match against Free State Stars to enable Arrows to snatch the title from Mamelodi Sundowns in the last game of the season.The 22-year-old midfielder scored a brace yesterday to ensure Abafana Bes’thende go into the last match of the season against Bidvest Wits next Saturday merely to honour the fixture and receive their title.The teams both started slowly and the first half did not produce any goals. Arrows were awarded a penalty in the 74th minute after Nkosikhona Dube was fouled by Pirates goalkeeper Tsebo Tsotetsi and Sibiya converted from the spot to register his first goal of the match. He completed his brace in the 89th minute with a well-taken free kick from outside the box. Arrows coach Vusumuzi Vilakazi, the first coach to win the title twice, said winning again was the cherry on top.“I am happy to win the title for a second time but it is not about me – it’s about the development of the club. Our aim is to develop these boys for the first team.” Regarding the star of the match’s hesitance to take the penalty kick, Vilakazi stated: “Sibiya has been struggling lately because of injury. We played him so that he could gain confidence. “I was a bit disappointed today when he did not want to take the penalty. I am the one who forced him to take it. He had to shoulder that responsibility. When he scored I was happy for him.”
