Women love to get their done. There’s something amazing about a brand new hairstyle. And with black women’s hair, it’s sometimes needed to do something to their hair; this is because black women’s hair needs to be protected from elements such as the sun and air that can damage hair because it is naturally dry.  Common hairstyles that black women do to their hair to protect it or to look fabulous are braids, corn rows, tight pony tails and weaves. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>As much as these hairstyles are so beautiful and good for the hair, they can be damaging for the hair especially for the hairline/edges. Here are five tips to help grow back your hairline/edges: 1.	When you braid or plait your hair, DO NOT pull the hairline/edges of your hair. In fact try to avoid the hair there all together until the hair is stronger and longer, but still do not pull the hair. 2.	Moisturise your hairline/edges with oils that promote hair growth. According to Naturally Curly rubbing your hairline/edges with oils can help with re-growing your hair, and the types of oils you can use are essential oils with vitamin E and Castor oil. 3.	Sleep with a satin scarf. Because black hair is naturally dry, it is important to constantly moisturise it. Sleeping with a scarf will help lock in the moisture and keep your hair styles in tacked. According to She Blogs, The material satin is best because of the smooth texture which causes less friction with the hair and scarf that may be caused while sleeping. 4.	Give your hair a break from time to time for it to breathe. This may help after hair has been damaged and manipulated. 5.	Be consistent and have patience. Growing your hairline/edges back can be very stressful but do not lose heart, keep on going and be consistent with the above tips and develop and maintain a good hair routine. If you have not seen results in a couple months, try going see a dermatologist or an Endocrinologist as there may be permanent damage to the hairline/edges follicles.
