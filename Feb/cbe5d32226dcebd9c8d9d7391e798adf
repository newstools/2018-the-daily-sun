If electricity is bridged that is theft and they have to be prosecuted,” he said.Tembe said the special unit that conducts the Buya Mthetho campaign received a tip-off from anonymous people who claimed to know that the Guptas had bridged their electricity meter.He said the Buya Mthetho campaign was launched two weeks ago by mayor Herman Mashaba.“This operation doesn’t discriminate.“We will be knocking on anyone’s door as long as one is not complying with the bylaws of the city.“Rich or poor, if you are not complying with the city bylaws, officers will be knocking at your door,” said Tembe.“We don’t see it as only the Guptas, but rather as people infringing the city’s bylaws.”See story on page 5
