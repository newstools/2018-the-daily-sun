Four suspects driving a green Toyota Yaris were stopped by the officers,” Khosana said. “The suspects were searched but the police couldn’t find anything in their possession. “That’s when Sejentu decided to search under the driver’s seat.“He discovered three gold nuggets estimated to be worth about R80 000.”Khosana told Daily Sun that the driver of the car and his three passengers were arrested.“Two of the suspects are from Lesotho, while the other two are South Africans,” said Khosana. “One of the men from Lesotho had no legal documents to be in the country, and he faces an additional charge for being an illegal immigrant. “The three precious stones and the vehicle were confiscated by the police.” Khosana said the suspects, who are aged 24, 26, 29 and 32, face charges of dealing in illegal gold. They are expected to appear in the Virginia Magistrates Court soon. Thabong commander Major-General Apaphia Modise praised the policemen for their good work. “The information that cops got from the residents clearly shows that community members will not tolerate any illegal mining activity in their area,” Modise told the People’s Paper.
