GUESS who will be back on the bench for Mamelodi Sundowns tomorrow?If you guessed Pitso Mosimane, you’re correct – the coach will be back in charge of his Brazilians, when they host city rivals SuperSport United in an Absa Premiership clash at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow (6pm). Mosimane served a two-match suspension that saw assistant Manqoba Mngqithi taking charge when they drew 1-1 with Free State Stars midweek and knocked Cape Town All Stars  out of the Nedbank Cup in the Last 32 round last weekend.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstO2jqostndFD21ufX6ay_YU903f0pQcf0ZtezjIXKSFbfD0fqad_keGSkiY2hOMQMROw-8VpGmsTMJDY-_a8sDvn7v0QqsolmWExZkHBD1fyHNU4pEmPMcZjdBG4r9uVExH8at3wqQeBGsVAkWRPc-s0qKs5Cv2coZKFlSQvJpUsOiNzL-YguVG81vC2MFZXXXtWH60-qkW_CZCSIf0ZIjNJDfx3QR6lG9sJVREzaOlndQEVdzd9-PLuYYKfeN88YUCqcHODERJO022gRCud1z5Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzG3xUEPQ4LxgEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

If they are not careful, the top eight train will leave them behind.Now more hesitant to speak his mind, Mngqithi has admitted that  they are in for a rough evening but said theywould head to Atteridgeville confident of victory.Said Mngqithi: “This time they are desperate for points to move up the table. We did well against them in the first round and we’re confident of getting a positive result.”They showed SuperSport flames in the first round in August last year, beating them 2-0 in a high tempo clash where United captain Dean Furman was shown a red card. Hlompho Kekana and Themba Zwane scored the goals.But Tinkler is equally optimistic of victory this time against their Tshwane foes.He said: “We beat Celtic 4-2, drew with Stars without conceding, which gave us confidence. The energy, desire and communication among the players are back, you can see that at training. We will play for a win against Sundowns, nothing else.” Sundowns will be relying on the likes of Percy Tau, Khama Billiat and Brockie.It remains to be seen if Sundowns captain Kekana and Themba Zwane will start the match this time.Tinkler will be hoping the likes of Thuso Phala, Reneilwe Letsholonyane and Evans Rusike are able to upset Downs and win the team maximum points.It is not yet clear whether goalie Ronwen Williams will be preferred ahead of Reyaad Pieterse. Williams has just returned from injury and the team struggled in his absence.Like this story?
