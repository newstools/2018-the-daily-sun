But when she got there, it was too late as the officials had knocked off. “All I want is my licence. I hope that woman gets fired because she is making the entire department look bad. We don’t need officers like her on our roads.” Ekurhuleni Metro police spokesman Wilfred Kgasago said the matter was under internal investigation. “The department will send officials to Nompumelelo so she can give us an official statement about what happened,” he said.
