New mums are left to sleep on dirty sponge mattresses while they wait to receive medical treatment.Some have to eat on blood splattered sheets while others sleep on the floor with their newborns.When the hospital is full, patients from other wards sleep next to the mums and their babies.The People’s Paper was sent these shocking pictures by sources who spent time in the ward. North West Health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said overcrowding was a problem at a number of health facilities in the province but he would send officials to investigate. “The department is aware of the crowding in the maternity ward. There are plans to add more beds. “The situation is made worse by the fact that Lehurutshe Hospital has been referring C-sections to Bophelong due to their theatre not working. The theatre is reportedly back in operation now and the situation should improve. “We will be sending officials to investigate the challenges so we can come up with a solution.” People who have witnessed or experienced the situation at the hospital recently took to social media to share their grievances.Tshepiso Mosenogi wrote: “I couldn’t stay there for 10 minutes. My cousin was in there with labour pains and was only given a bed once she was sure she was ready to give birth. The hospital needs serious help.Tshepi Mosupa: “People are taken for granted because they don’t have money for better health care! This is extremely hurtful.”Kelebogile Magano: “Hygiene is a priority in any and every health care setting. This is embarrassing to see as a health worker. Help is needed.”
