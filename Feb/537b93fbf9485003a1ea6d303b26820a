The family of the five-year-old who drowned in a pit toilet at Mahlodumela Primary School in 2014 is suing the Limpopo Department of Education for R2 million through Section27. Speaking in the High Court in Polokwane yesterday, Section27 Advocate Vincent Maleka said he was shocked by the offer Advocate Simon Phaswane made on behalf of the stateif(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssKZxHTCGmCMlqf5bgnLtJIoSDA4JhL_X1IhvfG0n4dpNZuDF1FvR0iNOgYItKs7UDnanRrdSR-QkkVEkusfnSAfSikhPR2S36dmdpgH5r6tLTz8fa0oNpr9HjcXA02UsLNb9lwPTa2G1QY2z-mB2pV62cDwll-esgjACvXIJvK9N4sMMdMQ0zBbIo1YOaBQdSF66_Su3IEqkEMTQGjgVCDi7zT5pgUQ_4wiVRAa3_5st56tWW0M2U0oZzQc1Rpz6-joTjZOWl1Pul18lUQDFC6yAzPnUQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJSz_0TFYFvBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Maleka asked for R100 000 for the couple’s other children but the state only offered R20 000. Section27 wants the state to compensate the Komape family a further R330 000 for psychological trauma and R2 million for constitutional costs.Maleka said the compensation the state offered was an insult to the family. He also went over the evidence presented to Judge Gerrit Muller by witnesses. Advocate Kate Hofmeyer became emotional when making her arguments later, saying the state had failed to properly investigate Michael’s death for three-and-a-half years and refused to accept responsibility.
