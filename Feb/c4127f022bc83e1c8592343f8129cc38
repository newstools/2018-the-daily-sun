A woman (31) and her two-month-old baby burned to death when their shack and several others in the area caught fire. The devastating fire was apparently caused by a burning candle that was left unattended. Police spokesman Captain Richard Munyai said a disaster management team and Jeppe cops visited the community.  “Jeppe cops, with the help of an NGO called Pastoral Care for Migrants in Bertrams and Bienvenu shelter, donated food parcels and clothes to the affected families,” he told Daily Sun. Munyai said the donation formed part of the cop shop’s social responsibility initiative. He said a case of arson was opened at the Jeppe cop shop for investigation.
