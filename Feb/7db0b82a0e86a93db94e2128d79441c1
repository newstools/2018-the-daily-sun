AMBITIOUS National First Division (NFD) side Super Eagles hope to pull off a giant-killing act and see off neighbours Free State Stars when they meet in a Nedbank Cup Last 32 match at Goble Park tonight (6pm).This rescheduled Free State derby washed out on Saturday due to a waterlogged pitch.Several PSL sides have over the years fallen victim to lower division teams. So far only Ubuntu Cape Town, who are at the bottom of the NFD standings, have been able to surprise Polokwane City with a 3-2 defeat this season.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstip-pb0D0HgHlnfwnQR8S5ADJc3Hu7aCE51hDH3llRLHkxFoi25bADzQJSQPj5LhT2vkS3PoO8hWTHZNowBch-31eXZ2qg2Cx3x1rDOaQ54WYE10goMuVE34UBmMwmkcwQGXdW2MK1hXeqDtBahve3TY5Z_3qkx-Zi2VO9ppvdTkeUkeJscyEUedJ1ZjyRjGfpPEhVmi4uVny0Xrj0RQGdR3X8WaDDDRDgXEOux4YQGt_SYTTpWydzl1vlSXEBgmyzJfoAkYXiI8AYE_oYmbQ8kd1h7vPZdzA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFMGqqdSnmwPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We can play good football, we just have a problem in the final third. Our opponents must know we won’t give them easy passage,” said Flores.“I want to be one of the coaches who makes history with a lower division team in this competition.”This promises to be an interesting encounter, as Stars have shown a lot of improvement since the arrival of Belgian Eymael.Ea Lla Koto have surpassed expectations this season, as they are among the top teams in the league.Eymael is aware of the danger that NFD teams can pose, saying: “I will be very cautious because Eagles are the underdogs. They have nothing to lose. They will come at us.”This will be Eagles’ first Nedbank Cup experience.Another encounter expected to draw a lot of attention is the match between NFD pacesetters Highlands Park and Steve Barker’s Stellenbosch FC at Athlone Stadium tonight (7.30pm). Stellenbosch have a score to settle, having lost 3-0 to the Lions of the North in a league match early this season. But on-form Highlands could be a tough nut to crack as they have now gone 14 matches without defeat.
