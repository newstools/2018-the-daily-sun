On Monday night, South Africaâ€™s new president, Cyril Ramaphosa,
reshuffled the cabinet. Amongst these changes, the previous Minister of
Transport, Joe Maswanganyi, was replaced by Blade Nzimande.The team at MasterDrive would like to wish Nzimande well in
his new role and we look forward to achieving even more in the coming year.Three areas to focus onif(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Chief among these, there are three areas which the country
needs to focus on as a collective. The managing director of MasterDrive, Eugene
Herbert, says the first is the festive season mortality rates on the road.Reduce festive season fatalitiesHerbert said: "Under Maswanganyi we saw a 10% drop in
fatalities over the 2017/2018 festive period. While this is commendable, and a
feat not seen for some time, the numbers are still very high. Approximately 38
people were dying every day.What do you think of the new transport minister? What are
the biggest issues the new minister should tackle? Email us. "This is higher than our own average during the rest of
the year as well as higher than international averages. We need to continue on
the path that was followed to achieve the reduction while also assessing what
else can be done to reduce these unacceptably high rates during both the
festive season and the rest of the year. MasterDrive would like to now
challenge Mr Nzimande to commit to reducing the fatality rate by 25% at the end
of this year." Enforce the laws we haveThe second area which needs attention is ensuring there are
harsh and enforceable consequences for drivers who break the law."This is especially true for serious offences such as
drunken and/or reckless driving. Internationally, there is a different attitude
towards these offences where drivers are genuinely concerned about the
consequences. South Africans lack the same concern and are unlikely to make any
real change unless there is real fear of consequences."CollaborationLastly, it is only with collaboration between all sectors of
society that we can expect to see greater reductions to our road fatalities.Herbert: "True change takes more than just laws and
their enforcement. Government needs to work with private and public sectors and
the public to get complete commitment to changing the situation on our roads."Thank you to Maswanganyi for the achievements made
while leading the Department of Transport. Every reduction in fatality rates is
a move in the right direction and we hope to continue moving in this direction
with Mr Nzimande at the fore."SOURCE: WHEELS24
