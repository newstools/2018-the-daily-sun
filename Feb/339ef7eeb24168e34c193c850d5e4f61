police to find the Life Esidimeni patients who went missing during the marathon
project that resulted into 144 deaths of mentally-ill patients. He said: “I have been informed by the police that they
have found 8 more former patients from Life Esidimeni who were listed as
missing by the Gauteng Health Department.“Four of the patients were found at the Thuli Home Centre
in Orange Farm and two were found at the San Michele Mental Institution in
Kwa-Thema,” said Bloom.He said one patient was taken to an unknown institution
according to his nephew, and another was moved by her mother who refused to
disclose her whereabouts but confirmed she is still alive.Although Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa said the
department couldn’t account for 48 patients, Bloom opened 62 missing persons
cases.Bloom said: “This leaves 49 who still need to be found,
27 of whom do not have ID numbers and seven without full names so it will be
very difficult to trace them.“The best way to find them would be by publicizing any
photographs that are available, but the Gauteng Health Department has
puzzlingly not taken this step,” added Bloom.
