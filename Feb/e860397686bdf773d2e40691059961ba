MAMELODI Sundowns will appeal Pitso Mosimane’s sending-off by controversial referee Victor Gomes during the Brazilians’ 1-0 win against Cape Town City FC in an emotionally charged PSL match on Friday.Mosimane was left stunned when Gomes pointed at him to leave the field, which in essence means he is suspended for two matches, after he remonstrated about a foul awarded against Tebogo Langerman’s shoulder charge on City’s Roland Putsche.Downs spokesman Thulani Thuswa said they would submit appeal documents to the PSL offices today and expect Gomes’ “unfair” decision to be reversed.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu0iyVBn98XH5KbCLFSC1aMrUsMTU2wkNkz-fzlSTFwDAwHey4IUNjHrQNQJsgE62uPlxsQ7rvBCC3B0RXZqNoV0d0lQ5fvxzhbvUODFbAgh2FtVxk0YjcdjaSN67g6qtrcd2ZoJllkAVcvRVT4VC1j202WE0aKLJGh0VHsyiI4we1rI65On7X8h2b4cs0idtcqFqnCl7457oucNwS-ctj8n6Evxq0PjrZTEahZr6nRpwqJ6R5DK9v26_nCLWR61fSia1zIs-CGdChkyIYW-TQhOQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP48DcVMcOftEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It was an unfair sending-off. We cannot fold our arms and keep quiet. The coach has the right to protest and the referee’s job is to calm the situation, instead of being emotional himself. Going through video archives of games where Gomes was involved, you are tempted to believe there is more to this than meets the eye.”Meanwhile, SunSport understands that City goalkeeper coach, Brian van der Heever, also fell victim to Gomes after allegedly making an obscene gesture at fourth official Zakhele Siwela. That was moments before City captain Robyn Johannes was sent off for apparently swearing.Downs are back in the same city at Athlone Stadium on Friday where they face National First Division side Cape Town All Stars in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 round.
