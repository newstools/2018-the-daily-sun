ALL goes well when Lebogang Siako (32) takes a woman on a romantic date . . . until they get to the bedroom.As soon as the 32-year-old man strips down, the ladies run away screaming. That’s because they want to put distance between themselves and his half black, half white penis!if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>But the sad man is not trying to scare women – nor is his two- coloured 4-5 his fault.Lebogang told Daily Sun he had been left in the cold by more than five women, who all think he is sick.He said his nightmare started 10 years ago when he was kidnapped and tortured by three men who dripped burning plastic on his 4-5. Lebogang, who lives in Soweto, said a shop owner wrongfully accused him of stealing from his shop in Tshidilamolomo village, North West.He and a friend were nabbed but the court found them not guilty. But the shop owner was unhappy with the verdict, so he and his two accomplices allegedly kidnapped and tortured him.He was left for dead and ended up in hospital, where doctors tried to save his 4-5 but did not quite get it right.Lebogang said apart from his penis having two colours, the wound also sometimes goes septic.“I go to doctors, but they only give me medication. I am appealing to specialists: help me because I am in pain.”He said his dream of getting married and having children had been crushed. Captain Adele Myburgh of the North West police confirmed they were investigating the incident during which the shop owner and his two friends kidnapped Lebogang and tortured him.“The three were arrested and sentenced to six years,” said Myburgh, adding that the three men later appealed against the sentence but their lawyer withdrew from the case.“The men never bothered to report to court. Last October a warrant of arrest was issued for them to be arrested.” “The case is still on and we are waiting for the court’s verdict.”The three men were due to make another court appearance on 15 April.
