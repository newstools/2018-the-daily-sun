PATIENTS are apparently being treated in passages and sleeping on stretchers and benches in the casualty section of Edenvale Hospital. There is a shortage of beds at the hospital in Ekurhuleni. However, this is not a new problem. Reports of patients sleeping on the floor first surfaced in 2015. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>At the time, the DA’s Jack Bloom said the hospital only had 230 beds, which was not nearly enough to deal with the growing number of people needing medical attention. When asked about the situation, the Gauteng Department of Health said it was conducting a cost benefit analysis on whether to rebuild or refurbish Kyalami Hospital in Kempton Park to ease overcrowding. Pictures supplied to Daily Sun show patients on drips lying on stretchers in passages and according to a source, the problem is just getting worse. The source said there were over 30 patients without beds. She said: “This is becoming a repeat of Life Esidimeni. Patients are dying on stretchers. “In 2015 and 2016, patients were lying on the floor during winter. Years later, patients are still suffering. The environment is not good and the passages stink.” Bloom told Daily Sun yesterday he wasn’t at all surprised that things had not improved. “Promises were made. They have to expand the hospital because it’s too small.” Dr Norman Kernes, CEO of Edenvale Hospital said: “The management of Edenvale Hospital is aware of the challenge of overcrowding resulting from the burden of disease. Patient care is a priority. The hospital is working together with other hospitals in the cluster to refer patients when the challenge of overcrowding is experienced.”
