A witnesses told police that Martin’s two friends died on the spot while he ran for his life, only to be chased down and shot eight times.Taelo’s wife, Nthabiseng (40), told Daily Sun: “I was with my husband the whole day on Saturday. “He left home to go and watch soccer and the next moment I learned he was dead. I found his body lying in a pool of blood!” Martin’s wife, Nomcebisi Moshoiu (33), said: “If only my husband wasn’t living with his nyatsi, maybe he would still be alive today. “I wasn’t even aware that he was in Bloemfontein because he worked in Dewetsdorp. “He left me with our one-year-old baby to stay with his nyatsi after we were married for years. “Now my husband had been killed like a dog. My only wish is that the police find the motive for the killing.” Another witness said what he saw was like a movie. “These men just had a minor argument and the next moment I heard gunshots. I’m not even sure what they were arguing about,” said the witness.

They are still unknown. “Three cases of murder have been opened. The investigation continues,” Mbambo told the People’s Paper.
