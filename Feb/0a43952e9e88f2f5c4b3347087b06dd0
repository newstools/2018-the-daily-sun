Two trains were allegedly set on fire by commuters angered by delays after a power failure, but not much was known, as cops were still investigating. Prasa spokeswoman Thabile Kunene confirmed that two trains were damaged. “We had a power failure on Wednesday which resulted in delays. The motive and the suspects are not known but it is under investigation.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssjm8khPQhXOEPDhl77eOwCSwBq4Mn6jVux8m1I72Tvdz9PCcOm3vu3PGaglryyiBUmXRFNJN0jpjPFPYmch7LE3ljjhqrexN6ClWM7FmdShGBJbXmm1E3Vc0LC3h85CM1CfZU7-pTkziXYP7ZuHb3cRN0ggRTLASHQ-czI_zmK5gNZSmiSIg58QzP7O7uoENe9M2Vc-s88aGaFrmeVXb71fN737-EtpTZ6jkWlbl_HO7ZIlnhMiH23CwdPkCkXvAWZR-Vs2_8J2RrOT_yH8GrjC2n8Yoc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEnEH4oALWT0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

When the SunTeam visited the stations yesterday, trains were running normally and commuters were on the platforms. The torched train could not be seen at Berea Station, where Prasa security guards were visible on the railway platform. At Durban Station, a train with burned coaches remained on the railway line. Durban commuter Nomusa Madlala (31) said she bought a ticket to Umlazi in the morning. “Everything is normal and I hope Wednesday’s incident won’t repeat itself.” Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed the incident and said charges of malicious damage to property were opened at Durban Central Police Station.“Two trains were allegedly set alight by commuters. There was no power and trains were disrupted. Investigations are continuing and arrests have been made.”
