There’s no clinic and we also don’t have water. We always have to travel to other villagers to get water and health care. We are sick and tired of empty promises.” Justice told Daily Sun that in 2015 a construction company came to build a sport complex but left without finishing the project. “There’s no development in our village. The only thing we see here are taverns. We can’t let our children grow up in such an environment. Children need to take part in sport,” he said.On Monday, Makoxha villagers also protested, wanting a local road to be tarred. They blocked roads with burning tyres.They only calmed down when officials from the municipality, led by the police, came to talk to them.Neil Mabunda, spokesman for Greater Giyani Municipality, said: “We appointed a contractor two weeks ago, who will work on Makoxha and Homu roads. The residents protested while we were arranging an official day to announce the good news to them. “A delegation from the municipality will visit the royal house for the official announcement and to discuss other issues raised by the villagers.”
