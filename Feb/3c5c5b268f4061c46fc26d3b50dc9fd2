It is a business decision, nothing personal,” he said.“I’m working hard for this contest, I won’t make the mistake of underestimating Visser. He is a talented youngster with a reach advantage that would make it difficult for me to come in, but I’m counting on my experience to carry me through,” the champ said.The 27-year-old challenger sings from the same hymn book as his experienced opponent, saying it’s business and nothing personal. “This fight is important to me. Winning the national title will help propel my career to greater heights. So it is unfortunate that the only person standing in my way is a friend. I’m 27 now, I need this title,” said Visser.Visser, the African Boxing Union heavyweight title holder, has partnered with the internationally renowned trainer James Ali Bashir in his quest to take his promising boxing career to the next level. The Limpopo-born Machimana beat Justice Silinga to reclaim the national crown in Bloemfontein last October. He previously relinquished the title due to a lack of heavyweight opponents.
