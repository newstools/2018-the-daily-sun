DUMISANI NGCOBO loves his church but is too scared to attend services. The 43-year-old from Emaswazini, near Pietermaritzburg, claimed Ebuhleni Nazareth Baptist Church members brutally beat him, accusing him of being gay and sleeping with another man on the church premises. Dumisani told Daily Sun the incident happened at the holy mountain of Canaan in Ozwathini, Ndwedwe, north of Durban, on 22 January. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstaSmPd-VJeLeAWpQ_CM-I0maauhM8VkCJM0MapZVOt15MP4UZFL9I4MbapBz7v3dq9RDHtaHyM2_figOiH8QgtVJ2AUDn8qfPYuQ_bPV_XwkpoG1efh-wO5HbrTDuEYt8Zm5OT-_rofsf_fxqssN6RAm3COqjCJYCxSDui5ZTiMp2cz5856w5ocXhKmlRby0efd2rL5tniMmWCdIdad1bkH2StX8WZpTOsfQ0tbHw1ryFJaFlKLMIBp2ipQPERpJa89eg9z78X2gV_JFiH8U09gU_t2fg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBTfSYF-57diEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I’ve never had any relationship with the same gender as myself.  “I don’t even know the man they accuse me of sleeping with,” said Dumisani. He explained that the man was a stranger who needed a place to sleep.  Dumisani welcomed him into his tent as they always help others. “We were lying down when I mistakenly touched him while I was looking for my phone.  “In the morning I was called by preachers who told me the man had told them I sexually harassed him,” he said. “I tried explaining, but they didn’t listen and started beating me with sticks,” he said. Dumisani said he wanted his name cleared so he could go back to church. Dumisani’s brother Sipho (45) told Daily Sun that his brother is not gay. “He’s not married, but he does have a girlfriend,” said Sipho. Ebuhleni spokesman Thokozani Mncwabe said he was unaware of the incident. “But I’ll contact the man to get the full details.”  He said the church is against people being beaten. “I believe the people who did this were amateurs.  “Real leaders know the correct procedure to follow if a member breaks the rules,” he said.
