IN a season that has seen all Absa Premiership teams struggle to maintain consistency, Golden Arrows coach Clinton Larsen reckons 28 points could be enough for a team to avoid relegation. Abafana Bes’thende are not safe from the dreaded axe at this stage, as they occupy 12th spot with 23 points after 20 matches. They are a point ahead of Polokwane City and Bidvest Wits, while two points separate them from second bottom Ajax Cape Town. Platinum Stars are at the basement with 16 points.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstCVCCU2WyZo79rM2cyV6iXS1Q8P9DwUr0noRfgGmFJMDL224hcUbqMqi3AOp3AN2LwP-g0-sHis5dVUK6stv8eZtRG7mHIurd9xNzcVdR3W1zkqv9SD8V_OG_MnbkYV-pvO-vcRCjN5oRt1uo5gYpdMEX_byw3e9QIlq4iX1B199k8UUvRp1Clr633WMBYauUtaCEH6Eene12zKoQKFSkBGTTvqcer_LJVfOSRlgk3JdRVN5VqhjrYA_u6n4pdsizw7CEfpEHWEKXvrNwhhSLMZg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGWGscWgNuIkEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He spoke to SunSport after his team lost 2-1 to rivals AmaZulu in a KwaZulu-Natal Absa Premiership derby at the weekend. Said Larsen: “In my coaching career I’ve never seen such a crazy season. I’m saying it’s crazy because no team has maintained consistency for more than three to four games in a row.Right now you can win two matches and get right up there, challenging for the league title. Also, you can lose two matches and find yourself fighting relegation. “In previous seasons you would fight for 30 points or more to be safe. I reckon this time around 28 points will do.”Despite the setback, the former Bloemfontein Celtic mentor is optimistic that Arrows will continue to play in the top flight next season. He said: “Dedication and commitment – that’s what you get from my players. They fight till the end. “We were never outplayed by AmaZulu. If it wasn’t for those missed chances I think we could have stolen a point. But we will soldier on and fight for that top eight spot.”Abafana Bes’thende’s next assignment is on Sunday (3.30pm) away to Kaizer Chiefs in the Nedbank Cup round of 32 at FNB Stadium. Arrows aim to reach the final this time after getting booted in the semifinal by Orlando Pirates last season. Arrows winger Kudakwashe Mahachi is expected to play a key role to ensure they succeed this time.
