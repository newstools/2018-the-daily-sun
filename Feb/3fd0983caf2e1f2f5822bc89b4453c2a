The warrant relates to supposed secret documents in the possession of the author. Pauw is giving his full co-operation to the police."The case relates to a docket opened by the State Security Agency (SSA) at the Lyttleton police station in Pretoria.Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi confirmed the search and seizures being carried out at Pauw's house."The warrant was granted by a magistrate in Malmesbury in Cape Town. It is a very complicated process and it was only granted to us today," he said.In his book, The President’s Keepers, Pauw revealed the existence of a parallel intelligence network within the SSA.Mulaudzi said the warrant covered any documents and evidence that could assist in the investigations related to the case opened by SSA following the book's publication."We are working in conjunction with the NPA and it is in terms of violations of the National Strategic Intelligence Act."https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-hawks-raid-home-of-author-jacques-pauw-20180228
