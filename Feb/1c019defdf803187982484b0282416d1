He said the storeroom had all the things they stole. “I suspect that they planned the whole thing well. They knew very well where everything is kept,” he said. “I think this was done by people from the area who know everything in the school. If residents could also work with cops these thugs can be caught easily,” said the parent Spokesman for KZN Education Sihle Mlotsh- wa said the department needed the district to send a report on the incident before they could investigate.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a business robbery case was opened at KwaMashu Police Station.
