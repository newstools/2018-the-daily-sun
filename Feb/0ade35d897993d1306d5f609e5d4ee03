A KASI church has committed itself to providing safe drinking water to schools during the water crisis in Cape Town. The Uyesu Unathi Christian Church in Khayelitsha donated more than 1000 litres of water to Mangaliso Primary School in Site C. Raymond Xazana (35) of the church said: “We have kids we look after as Uyesu Unathi.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>“A few weeks ago one of them came home with a stomach ache. “When we took the child to the doctor, we were told it could be contaminated water that caused the sickness.  “From there onwards we decided to find two schools to provide with safe water to drink.” They also donate water to Injongo Primary School. “We’ve budgeted for two schools,” said Raymond.  “We’ll donate water to them every first week of the month.” Mangaliso deputy principal Phumla Nkewana said: “We welcome the donation and believe it will help our kids.  “We’ll give the water mostly to grade R kids.  “They’re the ones that are prone to diseases.” Raymond asked for more water donations for the kids. “We need to donate more water,” said.  “Those who can may buy water and drop it off at our church in Khayelitsha so that we can distribute it to schools.  “We should all work together to ensure that kids have safe water in schools to avoid double trouble.” “We cannot afford the trouble of rushing kids to hospital because they didn’t drink safe water or they didn’t wash their hands. The situation is manageable, all we need to do is to ensure we do our part, that is to provide clean water to schools,” he added.Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said: “It’s entirely possible to avoid diseases if people wash their hands.” He said people should not drink borehole water or spring water but only water from the City.
