Security guards at Durban University of Technology (DUT)
fired rubber bullets at students who had marched to hand over a memorandum of
grievances to the office of the vice-chancellor on Thursday.About 300 students from different student organisations
participated in the protest at the university's Steve Biko campus.They are demanding that the university's management resolve
an ongoing salary dispute with staff, which had led to a strike, so that they
can start their classes.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsva1putUu9bA8--FuSMcHxtiN-GbQItDMljAOmggGBHQfwZy-iAbVhHoUyldZsD07hrv6sjIUEiIUyPFok542TfvobcMhIKHcOLm0cgWoKamYQirKgmdpK5E-vbxoijAicE-MTpAv4DimLY68Ywraq8mVnIUd5eBRy8sXg2SX0ZWjxYxWMTxVx2mx_NTpsFHHqxcesvKWZ9O2WdD0T5JFm-e1cY9ESj0JVbxhLvvjKWRGgoHF9gHSKiEsRtMFHmYkIhSwMYwu_qsUTfLkAkWP7RcGhJ798\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCgF80F7jvhwEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

including lecturers, downed tools six weeks ago.Fees Must Fall activist and EFF Students Command (EFFSC)
leader at the institution Bonginkosi Khanyile, told News24 that one of their
main demands was to resume classes."As the EFFSC, we want to go back to class. We want the
ongoing staff strike at the institution to be resolved so that students can
start with their academic calendar," he said.Khanyile said they were on their way to vice-chancellor
Thandwa Mthembu's office – which is at the Steve Biko campus – when they were
stopped by Mi7 security guards.The security guards have been protecting Mthembu's office
since the staff strike began."They opened fire at the students without even giving a
proper reason for their action," he claimed.However, they managed to hand over their memorandum despite
the shooting, Khanyile said.Provincial police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani
Zwane confirmed that security guards fired rubber bullets to disperse
protesting students."There were no injuries reported. The SAPS' public
order policing unit was also there to monitor the situation," he said.The students had on Wednesday threatened to shut down the
institution if its management failed to resolve the ongoing strike.The strike, by members of the National Tertiary Education,
National Health Education and Allied Workers' unions, as well as the Tertiary
Education National Union of South Africa, has led to the suspension of classes
at the university.Mqondisi Duma, South Africa Students Congress provincial
secretary, had told News24 on Wednesday that one of the main reasons behind the
threat of a shutdown was to force management to reopen negotiations with all
unions."They must find an amicable solution and allow students
to study. Our students are currently stuck at residences since they are not
attending classes but, at the end of the month, they are expected to pay their
monthly school fees for doing nothing," said Duma.Duma revealed that, out of the 29 500 students who were
expected to register at the university, only half had been registered."We will close all campuses if management doesn't find
an amicable solution to the strike or if they don't allow us to continue with
our studies," he said.While the students demonstrated for their right to study,
the staff also handed in their memorandum indicating that they have taken a
"vote of no confidence" in Mthembu."You have displayed gross lack of leadership and
management skills. Your treacherous actions are not conducive to a harmonious
relationship between labour and management," the memorandum stated.The unions claimed Mthembu had suppressed staff and
attempted to "bring us to a level of slavery"."We hereby demand that you leave DUT so that normality
can be restored. We were happy before you came. It is now time for you to leave
our institution," they said in the memorandum.The university was not immediately available for comment on
Thursday.Alan Khan, senior director of corporate affairs at DUT, said
on Wednesday that management held a meeting with the student representative council
to discuss their concerns."Both parties agreed to devise plans that will address
the challenges that were raised. To date, the university has registered 22 797
students and 6 320 of those students are first-year registrations," he
said.Khan said negotiations between the staff's labour unions and
DUT management remained deadlocked."The three unions rejected the university's 6.5%
increase on basic salary, as well as a 6.5% increase for the monthly housing
allowance. The university has not accepted the three labour unions' demand for
a once-off bonus (14th cheque)," he said.On the issue of the vote of no confidence in Mthembu, DUT
council chairperson Wiseman Madinane told the media on January 25 that the
council declared Mthembu fit for the position in November last year after reviewing
his performance.Mthembu joined DUT in October 2016."We did a 360-degree review towards the end of the year
2017. We interviewed the direct reports of the vice-chancellor - all the people
who report to him, students in the form of the SRC, unions, past students of
the institution and some members of the council, and that review overwhelmingly
said Mthembu was fit for purpose. He is the right man for the job. He is on the
right path and council accepted and approved that review," Madinane said.SOURCE: NEWS24
