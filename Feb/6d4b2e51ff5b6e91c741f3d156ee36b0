To be honest, I thought I was going to get a deal after the Rio Olympics in 2016, but nothing came my way. So here we are, two years later my dream is becoming a reality.“This move means a lot to me because I had to be patient for the past two years. I didn’t rush into taking a scholarship deal overseas, as it has always been my dream to play professional football overseas.”Also registered with the American club is Banyana captain Janine van Wyk, who returns for her second season.The thee players have been called up for the Banyana squad that will play in the Cyprus Women’s Cup from 28 February to 7 March and they will leave for the USA immediately after the tournament.Kgatlana says the move augurs well for women’s football in South Africa.“The signing of Janine, Linda and now myself is a clear indication that women’s football is going in the right direction in this country, and we are clearly being recognised around the world. “We also have several players at colleges abroad. This is just such an exciting time to be a woman footballer in South Africa,” added the player known also as “Pikinini”.“It would be nice to have more local players overseas as this will benefit the country even more. I know we have a lot of talented players who should already be playing there, but I am confident that with time, this will happen.”The forward is also happy to be reunited with former Banyana head coach Vera Pauw.“I can never express my gratitude enough to Vera, as she has shown a lot of confidence in me by recruiting me to a team she has just joined. The only way I can repay her would be do well, not just for myself but for the entire country. “We must see this mission as a chance to be ambassadors, because if we do well, this will open doors for many more players from South Africa. This would make Banyana Banyana and all the other national teams stronger,” said Kgatlana.
