WHAT was apparently intended as a bit of humour on
Chinese state TV has provoked accusations of racism towards Africans.On Friday, China ran its annual Lunar New Year gala on
state television. It is watched by millions.The four hour gala features singing and dancing, as well
as comic skits. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstktFSeCLY8s9uiVuI1enEmUvv7uogddf_t5gsI7EVbnUvphbtK5gijbDrnVKr9e-ReGQevQIKxHA0b6XOfaDF4P6qYViVWPt87h_TcENMAE6wigSW89m0n9k_Ot9lR4qNRXR0WK5KCL3atdhIbIqchvbCm-0oGumnWf1BRElSBHK8BkgYEbZRpWYjgKlrVvRYnitI32xm5_ZYGLo67XQFRwZoUsHGrcOmKMVpvYUK4QAwJ65APf81VI93qxcHV5vB8mepvHyQGMNCU0Z8ODSHSsew0GoaV9_7FuQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPzCW1i2OcJzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

actress, Lou Naiming, made up to appear African with her skin blackened and
carrying a fruit basket on her head. She is accompanied by someone wearing a
monkey costume.A black woman playing her daughter declares that she
wants to study in China but is worried her mum won’t agree.Lou replies, “Why wouldn’t I agree? A Chinese volunteer
medical team saved my life when I was young. Now Chinese kids are building a
railroad for us...I love Chinese people. I love China!”The internet lit up with criticism after the show aired
on Thursday night, the eve of Lunar New Year.“The racial discrimination was so clear,” wrote one
microblogger, who goes by the name Chen Fei Tutu.“Is this our nation propagating Chinese values? When
white people discriminate against us, we are strongly dissatisfied, but now we
are discriminating against Africans in such high profile. How shameful.”China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a
request on Friday from Reuters seeking comment on the racism allegations.On its Weibo microblog, online information platform
Tutopia said, “Imagine if it was a white person in blackface saying in an
exaggerated accent, ‘I love America,’ and not being blasted by the whole
world.”Others declared the sketch an embarrassment.This was not the first time Chinese media have been
accused of being racist towards Africans.In 2016, a laundry detergent company in China apologised
after running an advertisement in which a black man was stuffed headfirst into
a washing machine only to emerge a moment later as a fair-skinned Asian man.At the time, the Foreign Ministry called the sequence an
isolated commercial that had prompted no diplomatic complaints, but added that
China respected all countries, no matter their ethnicity or race, and was “good
brothers” with African countries.
