When the SunTeam arrived at the scene, angry commuters complained that trains were always late. Benjamin Masuku (54) told Daily Sun he had been using trains for more than 10 years. He said it was unfair when ticket holders had to pay for taxis to avoid being late for work. Many commuters said they feared losing their jobs because of unreliable trains. Benjamin said he feared overcrowing would lead to people dying because no one wanted to be left behind when trains arrived late. Meanwhile, Metrorail condemned attacks on train drivers at the Koedoespoort and Atteridgeville stations on Tuesday and Wednesday. A train driver at the Atteridgeville station had to be rushed to hospital after a stone was thrown at him on Wednesday. The two affected drivers at Koedoespoort were not hurt, but were receiving trauma counselling. Goodman Matampi, acting manager at Gauteng Metrorail, said: “We acknowledge there were some service delays and challenges. But this does not give anyone the right to take out their frustrations on our workers.”Metrorail spokeswoman Lillian Mofokeng confirmed the incident in which three commuters fell off a moving train at Greenview Station. “The three were hanging from an overcrowded train.“All of them survived the fall but one was badly injured, blocking the line,” she told the People’s Paper.
