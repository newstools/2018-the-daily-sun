The multi-award-winning film follows the life of Xolani, a lonely factory worker, who joins the men of his community in the mountains of the Eastern Cape to initiate a group of teenage boys into manhood. When a defiant initiate from the city discovers his best kept secret, Xolani’s entire existence begins to unravel.Acting Manager Communications and Public Education, Manala Botolo said they will draft a press release once they receive the full report this afternoon. A rating of X18 means that the material can only be distributed from designated adult premises.  The Chairperson of the Appeals Tribunal in consultation with other tribunal members agreed to hear the appeal based on applications lodged by CONTRALESA Gauteng and The Men and Boy Foundation. The complaints were largely based on the perceived cultural insensitivity and distortion of the Xhosa Circumcision tradition (Ulwaluko), and strong language in the film. The first protest action by members of the Man and Boy Foundation (MBF) began yesterday at the Film and Publication Board (FPB) offices in Centurion, where they engaged in a sit-in protest demanding the cancellation or editing of the movie.The National Film and Video Foundation (NFVF), which funded the film recently said it was important that the content they assist in getting produced disrupts and propels audiences to introspect and Inxeba’s focus on important aspects of our culture and traditions, while addressing topical issues of identity, masculinity and sexuality does just that. “The disruption of the screening of Inxeba should be troubling to all South Africans as it is against the spirit of our constitution. And I hope that we as South Africans will engage constructively around these issues.” said Zama Mkosi, NFVF CEO.
