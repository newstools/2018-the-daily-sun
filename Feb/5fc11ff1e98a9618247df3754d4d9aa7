One parent told Daily Sun her daughter told her what had happened to her school friend. “When I asked her if she’d experienced the same thing she said she was also a victim. She said she once asked the teacher for permission to go to the bathroom. “She said he told her he wanted to accompany her and that he’d hugged her strangely and touched her buttocks,” said the parent.The parents want the teacher to be fired. Elias Malindi, acting provincial education department spokesman, said the teacher had been placed on special leave while the labour relations unit investigated the matter with a view to preparing a disciplinary hearing.Police spokesman Colonel Pelonomi Makau said they were investigating three cases of sexual assault.
