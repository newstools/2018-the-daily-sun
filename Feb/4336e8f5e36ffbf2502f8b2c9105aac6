We were shocked when the noises continued,” Kagiso said.She said that was the beginning of their nightmare.“Sometimes the noise sounds as if someone is clapping hands on top of the roof though we can’t see anything. “My mother, who is dead now, suggested we find a prophet to help us as we believed it was a tokoloshe.”Kagiso says the invisible creature makes a noise during the day and at night but the sound is louder when it’s sunny.“Cloudy days are blissful for us as that’s the only time we get peace. We wish we knew what was really going on here.” Kagiso said they’ve been to prophets, traditional healers and pastors to no avail.“Every time someone comes to chase out the invisible creature it is quiet for a few days but comes back even more loudly. “And my mother died last year with a broken heart. Daily Sun is now my last hope.” Anyone who can assist Maibelo’s family is asked to contact Daily Sun’s Limpopo office on 071 126 5047.
