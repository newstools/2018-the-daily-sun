Its main focus areas are terrorism, cybercrime and organised crime. It was yesterday confirmed that Ajay had also fled the country. A source said it would not be easy to get him back to South Africa as there was no extradition treaty between Mzansi and the United Arab Emirates. “It’s going to be difficult but we will do all we can to bring him back to face the music,” said the source. Duduzane and the Guptas are wanted in connection with the Estina Dairy Farm scandal. They are accused of channelling R220 million meant for emerging black farmers in the Free State to their associates. Duduzane allegedly fled the country just before the Hawks raided his home in Saxonwold, Joburg on Wednesday.The Star newspaper yesterday reported that Atul Gupta was picked up by police while trying to flee the country. According to the report, a pilot refused to fly him in a private aircraft from Lanseria Airport. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said more arrests were possible. His spokesman, Vuyo Mhaga, said 13 suspects were wanted in connection with the case. When asked whether Duduzane was among the suspects, he said: “I can’t comment on that.”
