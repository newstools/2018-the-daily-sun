The two allegedly were among 10 suspects who fled in two vehicles.  Simphiwe Mutswane, Mxolisi Mazibuko and Mzwakhe Thabethe were awaiting trial for the 2015 murder of Warrant Officer Samuel Mchizana and Constable Solly Maluleke in Dobsonville, Soweto. The sexual offences unit cops were doing a routine investigation when they were attacked and their firearms and dockets stolen.   Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said: “Police have urged anyone who may know their whereabouts to call their local police station or CrimeStop at 08600 10111.  “They are very dangerous and may be armed.  People are warned not to confront them.”
