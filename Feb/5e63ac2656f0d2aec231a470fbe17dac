Duarte thanked Zuma for having served the country in his capacity in the past nine years.However, Duarte said the ANC expects all its deployees in Parliament to cast their vote for the ANC President, Comrade Cyril Ramaphosa, as the candidate the ANC nominates for President.Parliament will convene on Thursday afternoon, in what it is expected for the National Assembly to elect a new president of the Republic of South Africa. Zuma's presidency has been marred by scandal after scandal, as he leaves the hot seat, many of the country's State Owned Entities (SOE's) are left in disarray.These SOE's include Eskom, PRASA and SAA, in which he appointed executives that were linked to the controversial Gupta family and face several criminal charges.
