It was not something that was part of 'the plan' for my life but it was just something the I felt in my heart. When I met Ntando, I just knew. I was like, 'this is it for me and I ain't trying to waste the rest of my life without her" he said.Speaking about his wife, the Idols winner said, "She's an incredible human being. She's a strong character and comes from a phenomenal family. Everything about her culminates into this beautiful person that I want to spend the rest of my life with."
