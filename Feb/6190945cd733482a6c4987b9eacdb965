THE Premier Soccer League’s disciplinary committee will sit on Thursday to hear the protests that were lodged by Orlando Pirates and Polokwane City over the fielding of Tendai Ndoro by Ajax Cape Town against them early this month.Ajax signed the Zimbabwean international during the January transfer window.The veteran forward started the 2017/18 season plying his trade at Orlando Pirates before joining Al Faisaly in Saudi Arabia's.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>FIFA rules states that you can only register for three clubs during a single season.And Ndoro has now played for three different clubs. The PSL appealed the decision by the Dispute Resolution Chamber last week to give Ndoro the go-ahead to play. The PSL statement reads:“The Premier Soccer League Disciplinary Committee will sit next week‚ on 15 February 2018 for the two Protests by Polokwane City FC and Orlando Pirates FC against Ajax Cape Town FC‚” the PSL said in a statement.“The two clubs lodged protests ahead of their Absa Premiership fixtures against Ajax Cape Town for fielding of Mr Tendai Ndoro.”Pirates and Polokwane would have lodged protests in anticipation of the PSL appeal‚ which has been lodged with the SA Football Association for arbitration‚ going against Ajax.If they had not protested on the day of the match the clubs would have no recourse for points to be awarded to them should the PSL DRC’s original decision be reversed.This appears to make it pressing that the PSL's case at Safa be heard speedily‚ as Polokwane and Pirates' DC protests would appear to hinge on the outcome of that case.However Safa legal officer Tebogo Motlanthe said it was unlikely he would be able to provide a date for the PSL appeal before Thursday.“I will start to look at the arbitration on Monday‚” Motlanthe said.The PSL said a DC against Bidvest Wits COO Jonathan Schloss‚ in relation to comments made towards Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela following a match at FNB Stadium on September 16 would also be heard next Friday (September 16)."
