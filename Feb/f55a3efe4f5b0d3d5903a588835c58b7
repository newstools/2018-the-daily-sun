team spent more than 2 hours presenting evidence and arguments to fight his
conviction.Magistrate
Frans Mahodi addressed the court, saying that the state had proved its case
“beyond reasonable doubt that the five people who laid assault charges were
violated.” Rabalago
burst headlong into public infamy after he was reported to have been spraying
his congregants with Doom insecticide, claiming that it cured illnesses. Various
groups in society, including the CRL and Doom, widely condemned the pastor’s
actions. The Limpopo
Department of Health had opened a case against the pastor, and has welcomed the
verdict with open arms. The
department spokesperson Thabiso Teffo told the media that the department is
excited that the courts can realize that if nothing is done to prevent such
actions, people will suffer from various illnesses “from this pastor spraying
them with Doom.” The Doom
Pastor is yet to be sentenced.
