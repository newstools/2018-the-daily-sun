I didn’t like the way she touched my buttocks. I felt it was inappropriate and when I tried to raise it with her colleagues, they all ganged up against me.” He claimed the cops continued to harass him. “I was in pain and had to go to the clinic but it was just not my lucky day. I bumped into them on my way there and they wouldn’t stop harassing me. “All I want is my phone back so I can move on.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi advised Thokozani to explain his situation to the station commander, who will escalate the matter.
