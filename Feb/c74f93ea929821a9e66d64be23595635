AFTER a month of speculation, Kaizer Chiefs striker Leonardo Castro has finally lifted the lid on his transfer from Mamelodi Sundowns.Castro’s January switch to rival team Amakhosi had until now been shrouded in confusion in light of rumours that he wanted to join a French Ligue 1 club. For the first time the Colombian explained yesterday that his decision was not influenced by anything other than eagerness to play regularly again.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvuS-fuXFZzLk3MwTwYPMIIyVeiaAtEVMSvprb6mMqQPIk40XM5xJvj4ssJIO5aEy3QdDrN23dqrTVRPm7SOICyiLxt46TPU7E1JtFr8N7jEHuTQLNai1lBlOUUFnVgAm5YDwxt5CxOmFcU6JZv8MnRQsvcPDZdCEA2jxN7EvUt77qosmVwFIgE6RQCvM7hfWFrJs49VgwH24xscLlWP8BTmsScd7Gl1AY9PDH7uD1X1YGEVkjQ2fCCdqACzGOLX1HD5rWO-y0JUGpBXDUUccLmPw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBjvyTF1BAUyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They were not giving me enough time to play at Sundowns,” said Castro.“I was frustrated. But finally the move happened – because I wanted to move outside South Africa and was waiting on Sundowns officials. “But now I’m feeling better, I’m back on the field, improving, working on my fitness levels.”Admittedly, it wasn’t an easy decision to quit the Brazilians, the club where he enjoyed a successful three-year spell which included winning the Caf Champions League and the Absa Premiership.He has a burning ambition to return to the Caf club tournament and win “something big” with Amakhosi.“Sundowns is difficult to leave, but in my position it was easy because I’m a foreigner and they needed to create a space for another incoming foreign player,” Castro admitted.He says he is not worried about the lack of goals, declaring it’s a matter of time before he starts firing again.Said Castro: “I’m not frustrated. I feel I’m doing well on the field, helping to create chances for other players. I just need to be patient because I know the goals are coming. I just need to be there at the right time, at the right moment to score.”Apart from the 3-0 Nedbank Cup win over Golden Arrows, Amakhosi haven’t been scoring a lot of goals.They only managed narrow wins in their last six league games.They huddled together in prayer yesterday before training, seeking divine intervention in their endeavour to topple league pacesetters Sundowns.  Like this story?
