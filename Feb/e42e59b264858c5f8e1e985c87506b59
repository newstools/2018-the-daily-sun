Ramaphosa announced the changes in a statement at the Union Buildings in Pretoria at 22:00. He did not take questions from assembled journalists. Since Ramaphosa was sworn in as president on February 15, taking over from Jacob Zuma, speculation has swirled around when he would change his Cabinet. Back to Nene Nene was SA's finance minister for 18 months between May 2014 and December 2015, when he was axed in favour of then little-known MP David "Des" van Rooyen.But Van Rooyen was himself ousted only three days later, earning him the nickname "weekend special". He was replaced by Pravin Gordhan, who, in turn, was replaced by Gigaba as finance minister on March 30 2017.When Nene was ousted, then President Jacob Zuma promised he would be deployed "to another strategic position", saying this new deployment would be "announced in due course". But the announcement never came, and Nene moved to the private sector after resigning as an MP in 2016.Earlier on Monday ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe confirmed to News24 that Nene would again be sworn in as an ANC MP on Tuesday, which kicked off speculation that Nene would be returning to his old post. After he moved to the private sector in 2016, Nene continued to speak out against corruption, economic mismanagement and the looting of state resources.
