Gogo Noncedo Mdaka (63) said she was lucky to be alive. “We were all happy to eat the meat but soon started feeling sick. When I got to the hospital, I was hallucinating and thought I was going to die.” Dr Mphumzi Mdledle said when the patients arrived, they were dehydrated from diarrhoea and were vomiting. “We took blood samples as we wanted to rule out listeriosis. “We are hoping for the best,” he said. Nowinile Tom (56), the cow’s owner, who has already been discharged from hospital, said local men told him the cow had been bitten by a snake. “We didn’t realise it would be harmful for people to eat and we are very sorry about this,” he said. Provincial health department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said patients were being treated for food poisoning and were recovering well.He warned people not to eat meat from dead animals, which he said happens often in the OR Tambo and Alfred Nzo regions.
