THE heated protests that rocked the University of KZN’s Pietermaritzburg campus on Wednesday have ended and the campus was back to normal yesterday.Sandile Zondi, the president of the SRC, told Daily Sun the protest was a result of the university’s failure to provide enough residences for students. Zondi said a number of new and returning students had no place to stay while the university apparently turned a blind eye to the matter.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsueXQYBBhZps3lzcy1mqxMH0F3cgyMpYV6TkabrT4GxH9ov8-VTUFOwT65hgU86aX5iqpUmXpaIjOcHUvip_adwnytKeaOe8gfqCJ64EkQebDPzRB6XGZ6QpYNQLdGyJZFCdvvSXuHcZnSm6OW_p1a8cXPG8h25t_HKMSC83nJ1lx6eJWoFrQMNRa7FhzYiI8kpO3SxfVrpUfnp1DqYW4DMPQbb2n4anr_y1MIssGA91nYm3chVoOYCQPHZnBgrx6vqcwoac8lqaphFNABS2uNCNY7QRC0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAms0ON-cWdzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
