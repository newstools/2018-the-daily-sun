The Mmatau Pilwe land was also about to be developed because of his efforts.’’ He said Maselwane was known as a straight talker, a forward thinker and a happy person.“He would run quickly to attend to any problem in the community. His motto was: “A chief is a chief because of his people’’. Traditional Affairs MEC Ontlametse Mochware said: “Maselwane was selfless and focused on the province’s needs. His people never had impossible disputes.’’The chief’s funeral will be held in Mmatau tomorrow.
