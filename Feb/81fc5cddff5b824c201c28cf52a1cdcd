But after visiting her grave I couldn’t see any evidence to support this claim,” she said. The gogo said she had worked hard all her life and accomplished a lot.“I believe someone very jealous of my success is behind all of this. I haven’t had a good night’s rest in many years. I also dream of my daughter in a coffin and I am always attending a funeral. I’ve spent about R20 000 on sangomas and prophets who all say the same thing.”Sangoma Kingsley Maboe said: “Her life has been laid in an old grave, using her photo or footprints. She needs a strong inyanga who will take her to the graveyard for cleansing.”
