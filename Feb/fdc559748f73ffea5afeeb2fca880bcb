This event gives us the chance to teach people about the Tembe clan’s history.“During the festival, we also pray for peace in our community and seek blessings for the new year,” he said.Sibongile (29) and Sandile Makhoba (31) drove from Newcastle to attend the festival.Sandile said: “It’s our first time here.“We attended the festival because we love to learn about different cultures.“We also wanted to taste the original marula drink.”Meanwhile, street vendors said they felt neglected by the festival’s organisers.Hawker Deliwe Tembe (50) from Mjoji Village in Manguzi said cops and paramedics sat inside big tents while street vendors froze outside.She said: “We provided a service to their guests so they should hire a tent or build stalls for us.”
