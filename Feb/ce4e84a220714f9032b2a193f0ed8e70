WHAT was once the darling of Mamelodi Sundowns supporters has now become a drug den, a hiding spot for criminals, a fishing spot for metal recyclers, while izinyoka are feasting on its electrical cables.The HM Pitje Stadium in Mamelodi is now a shadow of its former glory after the Gauteng provincial government and Tshwane Municipality got into a tug-of-war over its rightful ownership.The stadium belonged to the provincial government but the municipality wanted to take ownership so that it could be fixed and upgraded to  a standard that would meet all the Fifa requirements for the 2010 World Cup in Mzansi.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>But a succession of members of the executive committee (MMC) of sport in Gauteng – from Lebogang Maile to Molebatsi Bopape and Faith Mazibuko – has seen delays in correcting all the venue’s eyesores.It belongs to the City of Tshwane, which has been dragging its feet in restoring it to its former splendour.Odi Stadium in Mabopane is in the same situation. The venue is in a state of decay and no one is prepared to come close to it for fear of the rodents that have made it their home.And the broader area has another white elephant – Mmabatho Stadium in North West. HM Pitje Stadium has come to resemble a scrapyard, with metal cables all over and toilet seats ripped loose, while taps and other valuables have been stolen, either to recycle or to be sold to interested buyers.SunSport’s visit to the facility did not yield many answers, as the stadium manager was nowhere to be found, while the security personnel were just there to kill time, guarding something that’s no longer worth the while.   Sundowns boss Patrice Motsepe wanted to buy the stadium before the Fifa World Cup but the government refused to sell, understandably arguing at the time that it was a World Cup legacy project.The stadium was mostly in immaculate condition back then, with the rickety roof its only drawback, and the mining billionaire was apparently prepared to replace it so that Downs could use it for all their home matches. But all he got for his efforts was a big NO.Sundowns moved to Atteridgeville’s Lucas Moripe Stadium instead, which they share with SuperSport United. You have to wade through tall grass on the HM Pitje pitch. Frames are missing, the windows of what was once a VIP suite have long been removed.It is clear that the stadium has been abandoned.A conversation with Mamelodi residents elicits a sad tale of a stadium that cost the city council more than R74 million to refurbish in 2009, but it was money down the drain.Local resident Paul Maleka called on the government to act quickly as the “abandoned stadium” is attracting dangerous criminals who sell drugs to children. “Crime has increased,” said Maleka. “What do you expect tsotsis (criminals) will do when you abandon a project where they can make money? They will take it!”Another resident who spoke on condition of anonymity said: “The wasted millions spent to renovate this stadium could have been used better rather than throwing it into our version of Kimberley’s Big Hole.”Sejake Phori added: “Tsotsis knew what they would find at the stadium. No one cares. The government does not care and the tsotsis only care about filling up their pockets by helping themselves to all valuables. “Action must be taken before something bad happens. These criminals are tampering with dangerous electrical cables and make it dangerous for all of us. The government needs to do something, and fast!”Current Tshwane MMC for sport Ntsiki Mokhotho has confirmed knowledge of all the damage.The last time the stadium was used was during the World Cup.
