SOUTH AFRICA Under-17 Women’s team have booked their place in the 2018 Fifa Junior World Cup in Uruguay with an emphatic 6-1 aggregate score over their Morocco on Saturday.Bantwana had almost but sealed a berth at the world stage after romping to a comfortable 5-1 first leg victory at Dobsonville Stadium two weeks ago, and although Morocco showed some fighting spirit at home, the passage to South America was never in doubt.In a match played at Stade Boubker Ammar in Salé, the visitors were always comfortable and could have won by a bigger margin, but wasted countless glaring chances in the opening stanza.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstAyOa60xNHN4T2ixQjiGs8NpNvjghHXy-64W12Ss0_oasY9B0IYuQTpgN86ymBZ50AFULBIPpfXoEFft-sPJjEJKgvpC4a6ICyD0fWmv6-Wl5E_CJgtBuR7e3BkQd29y5dJMCbqQk_3HJRRCliIZnFnOsOJQ5nEAtoDmf-UDvlj08W2JNK97bvgA0dhxuSz0GAGm5UlQQp97mT2XkgB_JrzU234K3stibH5IAMxq-SrlMoJuLmY1-MmzycEogpmBVdffiXyHAp3t7IDszn\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzI-0sR1oXpzCEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It is part of us saying thank you and well done,” said Jordaan.
