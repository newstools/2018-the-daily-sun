DJ Black Coffee is a #StyleCrush for his laid back, simple style. Black Coffee who's real name is Nkosinathi Innocent Maphumulo loves a casual look. You're sure to find him wearing jeans, sneakers, a t'shirt and jacket. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>His signature looks are printed t'shirts and high top sneakers. He sometimes does push the boundary when it comes to fashion, as you'll see him experimenting here and there. When he dresses up in formal wear, he wears suits like he's a king.
