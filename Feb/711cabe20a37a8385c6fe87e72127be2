Musician, poet, actor and presenter Zola, real name Bonginkosi Dlamini, has slammed certain black people saying they think they are better and know everything.Zola, who once captivated the country with his music and spread hope and joy through his philanthropy also criticised bloggers and people in Gauteng for having a lot to say about him while knowing very little about the real Zola.Speaking to DJ Sabby on YFM, Zola claimed that he is still the same Zola who used to be idolised by many at his peak.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuLugzFvQE9Eurw3ofbsbU113kf9dz3yj1Q3jjAgVI-44slhTgyxySUd09vfp6uPp3EWnr1lnm8rJi4VF2Ai-IV6ZsdU_e9_xF0emBFD9jRz2HahcDKzliaAa57-5tAVULOib1VyLiKPUiCWIHjU_NXMkL2CD_fczOFgnwRb8AsjdkuDTznMYyVEZ6BIePwb-nQPJB2EKJap-CqPbG5JOrDWIpbmv97rV7lJBCJwJEB-3At2X1CbBZtouLgMLD86cM56KYJPcz01E_1eU-lWPu1ZeRPRRYGTNK73g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNPZ9_hzGVInEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It is just little puny people who are blogging in the corner, compared to the 95 percent of the population who know exactly who Zola is. I call it the fame belt."Everyone who thinks they are something is from Braamfontein to Centurion. They have a lot to say about other people" he explained He claims that this “fame belt” consist of mostly black people who think that they are better than others and it came into existence after apartheid."Eventually apartheid changed to classism. There are certain blacks who think they are better, but they are a planet so small they are not even discovered yet" he said.While Zola might not have the same celebrity status he once had, he does still have a big heart.He recently announced that he would be giving away three bursaries in partnership with Afribiz Academy to study any course in the field of construction.
