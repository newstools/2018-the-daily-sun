MOST people think when an electrical appliance breaks they have no option but to replace it. But residents of Isipingo and Umlazi, south of Durban, know they can save money by taking appliances to Musa Kakolo to repair at reasonable prices. The 35-year-old fixes fridges, stoves, radios and microwaves at his workshop in Umlazi. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvprdnchOTs83gh2s0dJUGBAJjAP4Z9FPpmilobd-ULTteB0Llu3ko4tw_zvzypm0ECrzswvTkPDSf9P1gWjVVY8_VjVU-6jezwARUQ2NJL4zANuRCToR7wgZjdAajyG6D--974YYVisMzyH5NcIUfQHowV0DfD3boafO03bxT85j7v5NsWZgFdNMcpN7uaiGB8irVDb1yrX9PqAAVpQALP1LPa3jZdeVcvoo7VD3WgDDfyShY-KoWE6nIvyBUxxU-2FbPOIlvFU8Z99gr2dhra5_t84x4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGWPUGLTeFwrEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I taught myself by fixing things at home,” he said. “When I had a good understanding of how appliances work, I started doing jobs for my neighbours.” Musa said he was able to buy a bakkie in 2009 with the money he made. “I use my bakkie to deliver appliances to clients when I’m done working on them,” he told Daily Sun. He said although his business is doing well, there are some challenges.“One of my main setbacks is that some customers don’t fetch their belongings when I’m done fixing them,” he said. “If I finish a TV and the owner doesn’t fetch it, I sell it.”
