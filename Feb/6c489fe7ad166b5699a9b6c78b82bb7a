He added that the 106-year-old liberation movement would act responsibly to renew and unite itself.On Monday, a decision was taken by the party's national working committee to hold the special NEC to discuss Zuma's recall.This was after Zuma refused to resign when asked to do so by the party's top six officials."South Africans must not worry, the ANC will find its own solutions to the challenges facing the country and the ANC," said Magashule.He told News24 that he had later joined the meeting between Ramaphosa and Zuma.However, he would not divulge the details of the two leaders' engagement.Magashule said he expected Ramaphosa to give a report to the NEC on his talks with Zuma.The NEC is ANC's highest decision-making body in between conferences."The president [Ramaphosa] might actually give us a report on his meeting with President Zuma, the constructive meeting... the fruitful meeting," he concluded.The NEC meeting will now be held on February 17 and 18, dates on which an NEC meeting had already been scheduled.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-wont-disappoint-magashule-reassures-anxious-south-africans-on-zumas-fate-20180206
