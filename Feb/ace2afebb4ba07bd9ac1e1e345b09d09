When they saw a man fitting the description, they searched him. “He was found with an unlicenced 9mm pistol and three live rounds,” said Mbhele. She said he was charged and appeared in Eshowe Magistrates Court on Monday.The case was moved to next week for a bail application. “Upon investigation, it seemed he was one of the suspects involved in the killing of Sfundo Zulu (24) in Eshowe in 2016.” Mbhele said they suspect the firearm found in his possession was used for the murder.“The suspect said he was with his two brothers when they killed the man. “Both his brothers were arrested.“All three were charged with murder. “The firearm recovered will be sent for tests to see if it was used in other crimes in the province.”
