During the week they have services and they blast music over weekends. It has become unbearable. “The churches have also dug pit toilets next to the road and there is a terrible smell.” However, Pastor Sandlana claimed that Mokhadi had a personal grudge. “Ever since we arrived here, he has been the one harassing us. When we got here, we were in a shack and he complained the noise was too much.” The pastor claimed the church had services only on certain weekdays and the services never lasted more than an hour. “Mokhadi always complains about us, but never about the lodge right next to his house. The noise coming from that place is so loud you can hear it from far away,” he said. Kobeli Mokheseng, Ekurhuleni Metro Police spokesman, said they were not aware of the problem and would send a team to investigate.
