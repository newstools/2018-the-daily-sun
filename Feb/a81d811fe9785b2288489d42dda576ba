SOUTH AFRICA’s rising middle distance runner Thabang Mosiako was beaten into a pulp by a group of white North-West University students in a racist attack in Potchefstroom last week.The SA 5000m champion has miraculously recovered from the severe beating and is racing against time to make the trip to Algeria for the fifth African Cross Country Championships.Mosiako’s head was bashed to the ground and his body was kicked all over, and he was left for dead. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Unconscious, Mosiako woke up at Potchefstroom Hospital. He said the attack was motivated by racism, but he has vowed not to stop his love for the sport. Mosiako is recovering at home after he was hospitalised and is looking forward to a great year. But he can’t walk properly and gets tired quickly. Athletics SA (ASA) official and former Olympic 800m silver medallist, Hezekiel Sepeng, said the athlete would not be withdrawn from the team that’s going to Algeria. But Sepeng, who was born in Potch, urged the municipality and the police to do something about the unfortunate incident. Sepeng and ASA officials visited Mosiako and his family yesterday. Sepeng said: “I’m gutted. I’m sad and angry. They wanted to permanently injure the athlete. He’s a bread winner and supports his family through the sport. “This nonsense must end. Some white people claim to own the area and it’s about time something is done.” Sepeng said he was attacked as a young athlete and a group of white guys during his youth career. Sepeng added: “I survived the attack. I was born here and lived in Potch for a very long time. “The drinking around the university is severe and dangerous things tend to happen.” Mosiako said: “I nearly lost my life. I’m recovering and looking forward to the trip to Algeria. “They wanted to cripple me but I’m not going to quit.” The furious Mosiako said racism is still very much alive in Potchefstroom and he wants the people who did that to him to be brought to book.  Like this story?
