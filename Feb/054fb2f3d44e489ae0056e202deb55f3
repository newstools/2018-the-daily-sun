BACK in 1996, Rafique Pabale was the first person in his village to get electricity. When the whole village of Moletjie Moshate in Limpopo finally got power in 2009, Rafique was happy for his neighbours. But his happiness lasted only until 2013, when Eskom placed overhead power lines above his house after a transformer was found to be faulty. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Rafique told Daily Sun he had been battling Eskom ever since to get the power lines moved. “All was well until the transformer, which had been placed in the corner of my yard, broke several times,” he said. “In 2013, officials changed the course of the power lines and decided to have them pass over my yard without even engaging me.“At that time, I was working in Joburg. Since then I have approached Eskom more than five times about the matter, but they are not interested in helping me. “One official told me because I am a successful businessman, I will have to pay myself to have the lines removed.” He said the situation was very frustrating as it placed him in danger. Eskom spokesman Dikgabane Rampedi said they would look into the matter so it could be resolved. “It may be that the lines were placed before the person’s extended building plans,” he said. “Moving the lines will be costly and it will affect the community.”
