Instead of the contract being terminated,  two Eskom officials approached the supplier and convinced them to submit their invoices, even though they never rendered the work. The supplier submitted the invoices the tune of R2.9 million, which was then paid into the suppliers bank account.Sekgotodi said, the funds were however, then distributed to different account numbers alleged to be those of the suspects. The suspects will be appear in the Nelspruit Magistrate soon.
