It made me realise that maybe this was possible. I didn't finish school, to be honest. I ended up in grade 11 and I went to college to do A (technical) courses: A1, A2, and A3. That is where I followed my dream. I guess I have to go back" he said.He said that he sometimes struggles to read contracts with clear understanding and hence he wants to finish his education."I am struggling to read contracts and stuff," he said.
