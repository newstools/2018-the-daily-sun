If you are unable to, you may within 10 business days . . . apply for a deferral payment or suspend the debt where you intend to submit a formal dispute.”SARS further indicates that “failure to settle the debt may result in a civil judgment against you, in which a warrant of execution may be issued for the sheriff of the court to attach and sell your assets”.Thandiswa could not be reached for comment.Her manager Maria McCloy said: “We are engaging with SARS on some tax issues raised due to misfiling by a previous accountant.“It’s disappointing that an employee at the receiver has leaked erroneous information on the matter.”SARS spokesperson Sandile Memela said: “By law SARS can’t discuss matters relating to a person’s tax affairs with third parties.”
