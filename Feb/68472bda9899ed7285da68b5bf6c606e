The 2018 bursary recipients are all intelligent, driven and possess a je ne sais quoi! I wish them all the best in this new chapter of their lives and I look forward to mentoring them for the duration of their degrees and diplomas,” shares Mo Flava.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstqQ-JwS_JGQGP58BS22PkluAAYlcv9Otx4_uS8rgs7QJjWRCpDJ-urwFVhnZYM4MlZpPyRpq_7SB4-vG7L8xx-aqRz4FYrJsoua6QnZxW--SlwV-wmkn6aP9bP-eY0ja9vsXUQgCQlHS-veIUVjNEBF4GvtVSKVY6haF4BpLH5xBbxkOjicwfytmpMxJqdNzIrmBuE4b_S4-Gw_9WQEqOh-eisxkmAorRx5KPO1Zae11bx60d1NcmjMP2ZCAM6qxjKhLnDJqCt0e-xQpsHAzsixktF3EhbhP73Ug\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHEynRfbIm_CEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
