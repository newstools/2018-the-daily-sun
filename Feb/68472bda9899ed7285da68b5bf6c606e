Metro FM afternoon drive host and Club DJ, Mo Flava, is proud to announce that the Media Studies students under the Mo Flava Boston Media House bursary programme for 2018 have all successfully enrolled for classes across the three Boston Media House campuses namely, Sandton, Pretoria and Durban City.“Yet again, students came from far and wide to attend the interview sessions at the different campuses, which was testament to just how hungry the country’s youth are to be educated."The caliber of students I interviewed this year was mind blowing. The 2018 bursary recipients are all intelligent, driven and possess a je ne sais quoi! I wish them all the best in this new chapter of their lives and I look forward to mentoring them for the duration of their degrees and diplomas,” shares Mo Flava.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuY9U9v9tx-E0AVnVyv9vwbeqext5q4Fn8EBBtFg0ImabDhOrP2ELFqOX51tRoLV9t2_GZ1EJ85FiVurxYdyaic_5iJ9apyozB5AO28NL8uFoDoq9l_YiBGpYvknBChuYLQt_l55YLqELY3dCrbdtduyClWeAOgnCvAY4HWabwF92LclIrjRW_89YuOxgSZe9VBrrubqYNMz2F_m6CGFiYgjpCqGG6pbKdpDjD2mHCswfP0H3s38a60fZkZaJ7qg7uYi1M903bJny09Jqc-ySUEFH6RpxIfaRHtTw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA7nKNA-esX9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
