The 2018 bursary recipients are all intelligent, driven and possess a je ne sais quoi! I wish them all the best in this new chapter of their lives and I look forward to mentoring them for the duration of their degrees and diplomas,” shares Mo Flava.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssSubu9LoCrNLPqk4T7jwQvwH7IjHzH18SB_2jFI7OFsFFNIqne8sdSW0ObbUQwh4r8X6jC8c01Bqwscyg6AVeHPZB4glpg8Sx4Sl5dZ0gL56adP0pkL_nlCJL5koGAn43FJtx5fVVBKcB63Bolre4H7O4QtxXuale-skKZfTAxWASKCZk5eP_dfOsoSq1evOo0UsfkRPTrEcycZ12bQvwSszrfJtchWSVSv9f2ULdgJeGRtRijNNrvJZCuQ06GIzHYnXNKWH3pNkAuBR9eLAHvRFJkGd_EUhGfKg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBGNLcnyLJXLEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
