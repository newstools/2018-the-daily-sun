Neighbours described the victim as a kind and generous person who would do anything to help the needy. Kasi residents believe that the motive may be work-related, since nothing was stolen from the house. Rietgat police spokesman Captain Stephen Maluleka said the suspect fled the scene on foot. “The motive for the killing is unknown at this stage but a murder docket has been opened,” said Maluleka. He urged anyone with information about the incident to contact Rietgat Police Station on 012 432 7806/7 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
