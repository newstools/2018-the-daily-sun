SOUTH Africa’s leading men’s wheelchair tennis player Evans Maripa fought like a lion in the Bolton Indoor final against former world number 1 Joachim Gerard from Belgium on Saturday. The Limpopo-born star who reached the final in Bolton without dropping a set, saw his hopes of a first Bolton Indoor title ended in an exhilarating 6-3 7-5 defeat by the Belgian world number 9. After being knocked out in the opening round in 2016 and reaching the quarter-finals last year in Bolton, this was an even better performance for Maripa who returned home on Sunday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuB8ktkjzZOSlUwSeLElqKk-1NnAaJOUfQuE1M2KIUtuvTldl00iozdx2yJV9TN1WbVMJ7FlmcZyOBd-MU01jDhskbhXPVNA8iSgbuETfW37IKKHEbFHZzH-P6YIu-idRE1lvQCNyTptO2rzICKTCJJdrAP6pUkvFKm9xd68PO7euayDSE_mpZcpm7MJMJ3-nMybZ1d_F72g2J1y99hOS3P7kSuKksMZFzAUeK09pq6hyfljbH8Qpz2bUuTYIouLkdJ_UZVMO04hOMvdXXK\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YQ-me3mBCuR--JTb__AOFVulSpz60dkDuBuclzeCuZtXrAYJnKxMCJve5dlLr1nchFV8K7mbxa0cdn5MoVNnDagiPpoaxJWVFCj09C7ZQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIf7Oaq2CRz6EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I played some amazing tennis and managed to stay focused throughout the week which landed me into the final. It was really a productive week for me in Bolton,” added Maripa.
