SOUTH Africa’s leading men’s wheelchair tennis player Evans Maripa fought like a lion in the Bolton Indoor final against former world number 1 Joachim Gerard from Belgium on Saturday. The Limpopo-born star who reached the final in Bolton without dropping a set, saw his hopes of a first Bolton Indoor title ended in an exhilarating 6-3 7-5 defeat by the Belgian world number 9. After being knocked out in the opening round in 2016 and reaching the quarter-finals last year in Bolton, this was an even better performance for Maripa who returned home on Sunday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss7vl-kAqWLLunCkr2b3iEraZE3ZU5LBwX1YGjqg_FCNIv9hZxFh1wIkHqrNlACXPqRDWkPvzjSxoFGlvyKtpKPSfQV4NWJNY6MVPboOC7fZ6R2g8PAKoHwOHnUSiyOM8LyfxPvSSgntYU_PRIAelkMutOcwy82s2Mj1xG8L8TSIwuUHGOwczulf_m90ZUCvOl4MzC0ohvBRB3G2rOjX2SsadgHqiklxTtM9KvE2SmKkKQDazEidwRh8n78Wrc9dk1CC9mw9dKPi2OUfBen\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGzIUZFGusqXEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I played some amazing tennis and managed to stay focused throughout the week which landed me into the final. It was really a productive week for me in Bolton,” added Maripa.
