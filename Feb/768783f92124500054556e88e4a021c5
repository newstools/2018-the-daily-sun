The organisers have no choice but to schedule the race for March., but the calendar is usually congested around that time. The Grand Prix race is close to the Two Oceans Marathon that takes place on 31 March. Laxton said: “The calendar is congested in Cape Town between March and April. It’s chaos. There’s the Cycle Tour and the Two Oceans Marathon.“We’re aware that the date clashes with other important big events, but it’s either we take it or leave it. Two or three top runners usually miss out and that’s terrible. But they’re professionals, they’ll catch up with the rest of the leading pack.”Laxton insisted that March was the perfect time to run the race as the Mother City was the place to be for holidaymakers.The 10km and 5km races attract 25 000 runners.Laxton concluded: “It’s the perfect time as it is close to the Two Oceans and runners train for both events.”Makhanya said she won’t miss out on the opportunity to represent her country.Makhanya said: “My country comes first. I won’t run the first race. I’m just disappointed that organisers don’t plan carefully when looking at the fixtures.” We have to do catch up when we return for the next race in Port Elizabeth in May.”Last year, Makhanya missed the Pretoria leg because she was running at the IAAF World Championships in London, England.Grand Prix 2018 schedule: Cape Town – 25 March Port Elizabeth – 5 MayDurban – 24 JunePretoria – 4 AugustPietermaritzburg – 19 AugustJoburg – 7 October.
