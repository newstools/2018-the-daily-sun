On the same night she disappeared with him at about 8pm and came back alone early the next day. According to Councillor Mavis Maganga, the family was surprised when they did not see the baby for many days. “They started questioning her, but she kept ignoring them until Monday, when they found the lifeless body of the child.” Maganga said the law should take its course.“The community has threatened to kill her if she comes back. They want her to pay for her sins.” Police spokesman Captain Gerald Sedibe confirmed the  woman was arrested on Tuesday and charged with murder. She appeared in Kabokweni Magistrates Court yesterday. The case was postponed until tomorrow to allow her to arrange legal representation.
