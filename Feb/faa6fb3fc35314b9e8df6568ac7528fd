The walls of the buildings are cracked. This school is unsafe for our children. Even chairs in the classrooms are broken.We want the school to be demolished and another to be built.”The school was built in 1952 and houses only 360 pupils as some parents have taken their kids out over the years because of its condition.A teacher said they shared the same sentiments as the angry parents. “We are aware of the bad condition of the school. As teachers we are not safe either. The department must do something.”Parents took their kids home and the gates remained closed.Teachers were forced to go home after department officials failed to reach an agreement with parents.Another meeting has been scheduled for today and will aim to allow schooling to continue.North West Education spokesman Elias Malindi said: “Parents should not disrupt the educating of pupils while trying to outline their grievances. “Officials will be sent to the school to determine what could have triggered the upset and try to calm the situation.”
