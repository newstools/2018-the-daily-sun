ORLANDO Pirates coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic has called on fans to raise the roof and be the “12th man” when Ajax Cape Town visit Orlando Stadium tomorrow.Ajax thumped Pirates 3-0 in their league match in Cape Town last week, a shock defeat which still lingers in Micho’s mind.The two sides meet again in their Nedbank Cup opener tomorrow (8pm).if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>At the cup media conference held yesterday, the Serb described Orlando Stadium as the hospital where the souls of supporters get healed.Micho vowed to right the wrongs of the league loss, saying they’ve fixed the areas which led to his charges suffering their biggest league defeat this season.And he has looked to the fans for inspiration, who are arguably some of the “most demanding” fans in African football.“It’s always emotional playing at Orlando. You feel it in the air, there's a special feeling when you arrive there,” said Micho.“It’s an additional injection that pushes us to give our best. The fans’ presence has been the driving force. It’s been three matches in seven days. We are not made of stone – their bodies are not made of iron. We have questions regarding certain players ahead of this match.“But we have prepared well and believe we shall start the competition in the best possible way. We are totally focused and up to the task.”Past results will count for nothing as Micho faces off with Muhsin Ertugral, although the Buccaneers coach could be looking for some swift revenge following their league humiliation.“It will be a different game altogether,” said Ertugral.“I can’t wait for kick-off at Orlando Stadium. I know how difficult it is for opposing teams to play in Soweto. “Micho is a great coach and they are very close to success under his guidance. We know how difficult this game will be. They will come at us, but I think they’ll be a little bit more cautious this time around.”Like this story?
