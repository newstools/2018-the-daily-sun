ORLANDO Pirates midfielder Bernard Morrison is not shy to make his opinion known. The 24-year-old has been open about his struggle to get game-time. He admitted he was nowhere near the form that made Bucs sign him from DR Congo outfit AS Vita.But Morrison, who has been in and out of the team in his one-and-a-half year stay at the Soweto giants, has vowed to fight for his place in the team. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>And on Saturday, the Ghanaian international gave a glimpse of what he can do when he scored a brace at Orlando Stadium to give Bucs a 2-0 win against Ajax Cape Town in the Nedbank Cup Last 32. Bucs coach Milutin Sredojevic took a big gamble when he made six changes and Morrison, one of those changes, grabbed the opportunity with both hands, also bagging the Man of the Match award. The midfielder explained his unusual celebration act, which saw him crawl on his knees to taunt his former coach, Muhsin Ertugral. He says Sredojevic knows he can be crazy sometimes. Said Morrison: “There were some problems between me and Muhsin during his time at the club and the celebration was for him. It was a rehearsed celebration that would get the message across to Ertugral.”But for a player of his ability, he has found it unexpectedly tough to adjust to the Bucs setup, even getting demoted to the MultiChoice Diski Challenge team to regain his confidence.Morrison said: “I was not prepared for the task ahead and took things for granted. There was a lot of speculation that I would leave the club. But I stayed and now I want to prove that I’m good enough. “The coach gave me a rare opportunity to start and I returned the favour with my performance. I have to keep pushing.” And to show his crazy side, when Sredojevic was asked if he was interested in signing free agent Kermit Erasmus, Morrison appeared upset, saying: “I have a question for you (journalist) – so you want them to bring Kermit here to chase us.
