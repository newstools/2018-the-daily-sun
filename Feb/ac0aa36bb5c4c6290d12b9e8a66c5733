No one knew who did this but the department opened a case with the police. “It was then discovered that the principal was the suspect. After he was arrested, the department took a decision to suspend him.” Mthethwa refused to give more information on the principal’s arrest as it might jeopardise the investigation.“It is our rule to suspend our staff members when there is an investigation into them,” said Mthethwa.Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana expressed shock at the matter, saying they could not tolerate bad conduct. According to KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, no case has been opened against the teacher.
