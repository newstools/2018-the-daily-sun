Former DA Parliamentary Leader Lindiwe Mazibuko has come out in defence of Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille after the DA opened a case of bribery against her.Mazibuko said on Twitter on Monday morning: “I am sick of people describing Patricia De Lille as power drunk as if this empty accusation can be legitimised by repetition. A black woman's ambition is not a crime. A black woman exercising power in elected office is not an aberration. We see you and your dog whistle politics.”The DA claimed that De Lille solicited R5 million a bribe from a Vanderbijlpark businessman in 2012. De Lille regards the claim as ridiculous and said this is just the latest attempt by the DA who has repeatedly tried to oust her since last year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvGpEQzZ0my8k7R5Nh609h1rfZXBzp0F_Q53GbX8Os5b2C0JMgK9c2WSLvYTSFzEqQ5gxCT8YbIy6Hmtg4XDvCds8vTj0LfW_aCJGpAIDjG07fLDYZ6BYUkltmrsUp97Xjp9KDJUhyU8jW8nF4VieFBzDs39nd6RzXQn1Wz1GvfvBiO3difsDJThISCbYvWm_UgYdJGl81f0PGzkezO_9FW4mLg4-bRDPnFEk3XoYQNQdTU_jZitT_WNisgqqoJzOfe5eJB7luDMS1rU77gkHwNpPXMy1c\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzK0ECXx9yHu0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Why is this man coming forward when the DA is charging me for other matters? This seems to be the latest of a string of moves by the DA to taint my name by clutching at anything," said the adamant De Lille.DA’s Federal Executive chairperson James Selfe confirmed the complaint and said it’s related to an alleged attempt by De Lille to solicit a R5-million bribe from Vanderbijlpark businessman Anthony Foul in 2012.“Once this has been brought to our attention, we have an obligation by law to act on it,” said Selfe.De Lille however said many people do not see that the DA is just out to destroy her.“People are blind in anger and dislike of me they don’t even want to respect the country's Constitution,” she said.
