THE FORMER makhwapheni is apparently making life hell for her ex’s wife!The two are neighbours in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. According to Aniki Mokoena (47), her husband cheated on her with a neighbour years ago, but after some time he came to his senses and returned to her. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>She said it seems to be the source of never-ending problems with the ex-makhwapheni makhelwani. Their battle saw the makhwapheni being locked up last Thursday for defying a court order. The two women have been at each others’ throats, but mum of eight Aniki says she is now tired.She told Daily Sun the drama started in the 1990s when her sister-in-law came to stay. “She befriended our neighbour after relations soured over the family house.” Eventually, said Aniki, her sister-in-law left and her husband broke off his affair. “I thought things would be back to normal as she had no reason to fight with me. “I was wrong. She now has invited her friends, who terrorise me about my bottle recycling project.“They say I dirty the street. I have taken the matter to court and even approached the municipality just so they can help me get her off my back. But I seem to be fighting a losing battle,” said sad Aniki.The SunTeam spoke to neighbour Agnes Simunda (53), who denied having an affair with Aniki’s husband, Samuel Mokoena (56). “Because I live alone, they accuse me of dating that guy,” she said.But Samuel confessed to having had an affair with Agnes. “It pains me to see my wife victimised because of my sins. I dated this woman ages ago. I think she remains bitter that I went back to my wife.” Captain Piet Rossouw said a case of defying a court order was opened and investigations are under way.
