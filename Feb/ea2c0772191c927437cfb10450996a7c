On 28 December, we got a call to say a woman had been found dead. We went to identify the body and gave DNA samples to the police, but we are still waiting to bury her.”Moses said he had been having sleepless nights as Regina visited him in his dreams. “She wants a final resting place.” Police spokesman Captain Daniel Mavimbela said the family was told that DNA identification processes still needed to be completed. “The samples we initially obtained could not be used to determine the body’s identity due to the state of decomposition,” he said. “We are aware of the sensitivity surrounding the matter and the family’s grief. We have requested that the DNA tests be processed as soon as possible. A case of murder is being investigated, but no arrest has been made,” he said.
