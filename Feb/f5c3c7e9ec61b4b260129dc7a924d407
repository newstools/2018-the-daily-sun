I'm very happy about playing these types of games, today there's no pressure in particular, we've prepared the game in the same way we always do."There will always be pressure here, it's something habitual, but I'm going to keep enjoying myself."Zidane is facing a French team for the first time since taking the reins at Real in 2016, but said he had nothing to prove back in his home country."We're not going to change what people think of us, all we can do is work hard, and working hard is my passion. I try to transmit things to my players but I have nothing to prove tomorrow, I just want to play the game, I don't care what people say about me," he said.Madrid left back Marcelo said he and his team mates were still fully behind their embattled manager, who has won a total of eight trophies since succeeding Rafa Benitez."Our coach is very close to the players, he has helped us a lot and continues to help us," said the Brazilian."He's a great coach, it's true we're not in the situation we want to be but he's doing everything to get us back to where we were. He's very patient, he believes in his work and we believe in him and his work."
