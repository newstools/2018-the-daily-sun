Five suspects aged between 25 and 35 died at the scene, while one suspect was rushed to hospital,” she said. “Three unlicenced firearms were found, as well as two TV sets, two digital cameras and a laptop. The items were suspected to have been stolen during the robberies.” Mbhele said the suspect would be charged with attempted murder and possession of an unlicenced firearm and stolen goods once he’s discharged from hospital.
