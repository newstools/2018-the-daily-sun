He told me to go home without even giving me any medication.“I can no longer take the pain. even the pills I buy no longer ease the pain. I have nothing to wash or treat the wound with. It’s just like waiting to die,” he said.The madala said the wound started as a pimple last February and grew into a big lump. Madala Jonas said the doctors at the hospital had promised to transfer him to Steve Biko Academic Hospital but up to this day, nothing has happened.“I am in so much pain and I don’t even have medication,” he said.His wife Sarah (64) said she called Steve Biko to check when her husband could go but she was told to wait. “Life has been very hard for us since my husband became ill. We have been in and out of hospital without any help. They didn’t even give him bandages to cover the wound.” Mpumalanga Department of Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said the patient first visited the hospital in September and his last visit was last month. “The patient was treated and given medication and bandages. “The patient’s results and referral letter were sent to Steve Biko as well as his two contact numbers.“They were written on the transfer letter so that the oncology unit at Steve Biko could contact him when they are ready to see him. “It should be noted that bookings or dates are given by the oncology unit and are subject to availability of space.”
