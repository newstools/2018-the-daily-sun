He said it was the investigating officer’s responsibility to keep the victims’ relatives updated about decisions taken by the NPA.He said: “In Thobela’s case, two suspects went to court but there wasn’t enough evidence to link them to his murder. “One ended up being charged with unlawful possession of a firearm while the other was charged with vehicle theft.”He said the ammunition didn’t match the bullet used to shoot Thobela.“It was also never established if the vehicle was the one used to transport the man who killed Thobela.” He also spoke about the complaint made by the Ntombela family from Nquthu. Their relative Vusumuzi Ntombela, a municipal speaker and deputy principal, was shot and killed in 2015.Although two convictions were made in Ntombela’s murder case, the family said they believed there were more people involved.“In Ntombela’s case, it appeared that no other person was involved,Selepe.“But if the family has information, they can come to us.”He said the NPA works closely with investigating officers.“It is their duty to keep families in the loop. “However, we do assist when families request information directly from us.”
