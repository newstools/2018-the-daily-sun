But she didn’t finish high school because she needed her birth certificate. She ended up having kids who also don’t have birth certificates. “I can’t even apply for those and my kids don’t receive child support grants.” After moving to KwaMancinza, Thembelihle began work as a hairdresser.She said her kids do go to school but she has to explain to the teachers that she’s working on getting her ID. “I’ve been to Home Affairs in Durban but they aren’t helping. They told me there’s no proof that I’m South African.” The desperate woman appealed to Daily Sun for help. KZN Home Affairs spokesman Cyril Mncwabe said he called Thembelihle and is working on her issues. “I asked her to get a letter from the hospital where she was born and also get a letter from her first school. Once she has those, I’ll help her.”
