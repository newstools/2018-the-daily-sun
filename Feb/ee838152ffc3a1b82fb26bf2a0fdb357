THERE are many new car brands with strange names on the roads these days.Another one has now hit the streets with a truly South African name.Ladies and gents, feast your eyes on the Zwane – bolted and brought together in Fine Town in the south of Joburg! if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The car is the home project of Mnqweno Nomgca, who used junk material to build his state-of-the-art vehicle from scratch.It took him only two months to get it moving, and people react with amazement when they see it on the streets.The 54-year-old Mnqweno made his car out of old mattresses, zinc sheets and any steel material he could come across. He used a Nissan 1400 engine to get it moving.Mnqweno told Daily Sun he began building the car when he realised he would not be able to afford to buy one for his family.When he told his family he would build a car, they thought he was playing.“I had many concepts of cars in my book and decided to make this one because it didn’t need much material. Now things have become easier as we go to shops and other places with my new car,” said Mnqweno.He used only a pair of pliers, a grinder and a screwdriver to produce his masterpiece. He dreams of other projects too. “I need help so I can open my own workshop. This will allow me to transfer my skill to others who would like to learn.” he said.
