BIDVEST Wits have started playing like the team that captured the Absa Premiership title last season. They are giving the kind of performances that no-nonsense coach Gavin Hunt has wanted to see since the season first began. It may be too little too late to defend their league title, but the Clever Boys seem to have finally found their rhythm. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvWOxCvXqzuyT5D3w2WF1xZfUwZAbvUvQKDzHcdwTUFmtNm6mLmCreSEpHJryn5BrZTzZUt0GrlR3BNACCau2zTwN75xw-O7YgwOYjwqwrEwnwuFPpFJ-uawiW-SIeK_X-u6KjacArshpHp8vVcOM2ncE8pG4M2AmtsIDz8jv03pZpeurNrxXtNY05VYntqexQf1-mNajwdKydedWXDweKEXmrZVqE8xZbHtQNNsLyTY4gUIPa9KxB7Wx91ojJVt05s12GFKepazVWjAfOWO59opA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOQmdEYob5zbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The Students’ target now is to move away from the relegation zone and secure a top eight finish. Few will bet against them reaching their objective, judging by their revival. Considering their run in the league lately, registering three wins, a draw and one defeat since the turn of the year, Wits certainly seem to have turned the corner. They occupy 12th position with 21 points from 19 matches, while Amakhosi are title contenders in fourth position with 30 points from 19 games. Hunt’s boys gave SuperSport United a 4-1 hiding at the Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgville last week. Few were expecting such a big win but Hunt insists eventual victory was inevitable. He said: “I’m not surprised at all – someone had to suffer that big defeat. We have been playing well and creating chances, it was just a matter of time. We were rewarded for our hard work.” The 10-man Clever Boys held Amakhosi to a controversial 1-1 draw at the FNB Stadium in the first round. Egyptian striker Amr Gamal rescued a dramatic late equaliser in a game that produced more than 10 yellow cards and one red. Hunt still remembers that ill-fated game well. He said: “It was not a fair game. We were issued with cards – but let’s not go there. It’s another big game against Chiefs but we can’t be concerned about them.“Every game is a big game for us until the end. We have to try and win them all to finish high up in the table.” Hunt urged his team to continue where they left off against SuperSport: “We need to continue picking up points and that is what we aim to do against Chiefs.”Like this story?
