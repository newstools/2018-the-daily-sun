IT IS not often that Mamelodi Sundowns go into a match as underdogs.A team loaded with talent and flair, the Brazilians are usually expected to flatten any opponents, whether playing at home or away.But Downs coach Pitso Mosimane reckons it could be different this time when the log leaders visit closest title rivals Cape Town City FC this weekend.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvlHql0ZugdUpYd-DUGmAFOKx35c3s8pVBAuEfbubDB1q4tlhvjEuizIcAFK7e6tszU8jFJ40YokXvXSwjnw1z_B8vDw_XzzBerxXMHjcchYUmqOO7VCEmsA8vVRKWq3JGnKd4D0k3mORit_YNeZWn-EaMa0xjpHoVo7lurds_alDnKF0wW1msR146Oy7a5J8ZefPdRHDWWrGeFA14lF3bbuLGI0fb6ZwM7ojuGruAmB25qUWXiyvc12nOX6bO9c02T0C2d9MO9zSk8dkkN2X3hCg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKLNC4WqcGzPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We should look at the log situation – if you don’t win you must keep the distance the same. “But the pressure is on them to maintain their consistency in beating us. We’ve got nothing to lose.”It could well be mind games, an attempt to lull City into a false sense of security.But Mosimane has also noted the fact that Benni McCarthy’s men often punch above their weight against Sundowns.City become a formidable force, looking completely different to the side that would struggle to dominate lowly teams.Suspended McCarthy watched from the stands as City laboured to a 1-1 draw with Bloemfontein Celtic on Sunday.City are second in the table with 31 points, trailing log leaders Downs by four points.“They do well against us. When they see us they play a different game,” Mosimane said. “I saw Celtic were all over them in the second half on Sunday, Free State Stars did exceptionally well against them?.?.?. and Maritzburg United. So I’m asking myself if they save the best for us. But we have to do what we have to do.”Mosimane is hoping Thapelo Morena will be back for the trip to Cape Town on Friday, the fullback having fully recovered from injury.“Mabunda has a slight knock from Saturday’s game. Morena has been out for a while. We’ve used Madisha in his position but he is not a typical right back. Hopefully he’ll be back.”
