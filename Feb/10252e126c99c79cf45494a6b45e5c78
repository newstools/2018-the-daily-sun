officers died instantly.An off-duty
soldier was also shot as they were fleeing the scene.The
suspects then allegedly hijacked a police van with two officers in the van with
them.Their
bodies were later found six kilometers from the station.Minister
Mbalula said that he was “shocked and outraged by the reported killings.”“The
killing of our law enforcement officers robs us of dedicated servants of our
people whose only sin was to serve and protect,” he said.“It’s a sad
and tragic loss to their families.”General Sithole
said he was appalled and deeply saddened by the cold and heartless attack on the
cops.Sithole
said that he has appointed a task team comprising of experienced detectives of
the South African Police Service and the Hawks to investigate this attack.Sithole has
also called upon the community to assist with any information that could help
identify and bring these perpetrators to book.“While the
motive for this attack is not clear yet we have established that the suspects
have a robbed an ATM a short distance away from the police station, stolen 10
firearms as well as a police van from the station,” Sithole said.Information
can be communicated to the SAPS Crime Stop number 086 00 10111. Callers may
remain anonymous and all information will be treated in the strictest of
confidence, Sithole added.
