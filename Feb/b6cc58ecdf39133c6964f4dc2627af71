"This will enable President Zuma and myself to conclude our discussions and report back to our organisation and the country in the coming days," said Ramaphosa.He said he was aware that the uncertainty surrounding the position of the Head of State and Government is a cause for concern among many South Africans. "This is understandable. However, I am certain that the process we have now embarked on will achieve an outcome that not only addresses these concerns, but also unites our people around the tasks that all of us must necessarily undertake to build our country. We will be able to communicate further on President Zumaâ€™s position as President of the Republic once we have finalised all pertinent matters."While the current situation has necessitated the postponement until further notice of the State of the Nation Address, the work of government and Parliament will continue."This is a challenging time for our country. Both President Zuma and myself are aware that our people want and deserve closure. The constructive process we have embarked on offers the greatest opportunity to conclude this matter without discord or division."Throughout this process, I am guided by the principle that the interests and needs of the South African people are paramount," said Ramaphosa.
