After the resignation of Mzansi's former president, Jabob Zuma, a social media user posted a picture of himself wearing an ANC t-shirt, but Zuma's image had been cut out of the t-shirt.As quirky as this image is, it does send a strong message. There were many MEMEs after Zuma resigned, this one stood out to the #SunTeam.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstujLyziCFV7JWAFb2c4Vve_6tgcUuqu8KlJNU6bcqr5UhBms5meP5_-e6xV49dvZafFZYjO2Mgn83poLGH92M8977ASJKtFpO7rOAmuaST_uRlVUd4DCKE8Ji3inmO6eREZTiUemUsukHu682VkFv3ZD6keVR4HYQzDmwO1QcXLtD5eGi-dbmN1VY2RFPw9odHxGh4eW1jBLaayvrNskUp3NT1I5F54TU7Ihsjv91FHWwIgY9BlKU-Bdeqby5gTsfvUlRdTM-WyJRVUUvSd7rcqVedB42MRyoZ6g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBmBdxvr7ZVpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The picture also reminds one that ANC is a big party, and that no leader within the ANC is bigger than the organization itself.What's you interpretation of this picture? Comment below.
