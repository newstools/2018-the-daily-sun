After the resignation of Mzansi's former president, Jabob Zuma, a social media user posted a picture of himself wearing an ANC t-shirt, but Zuma's image had been cut out of the t-shirt.As quirky as this image is, it does send a strong message. There were many MEMEs after Zuma resigned, this one stood out to the #SunTeam.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvugQsWA7fXYuGsJCjtHu1I11m5EfLOyzqVmjZ03PhnNcu9McW9E0lO8nac_outCGsl7cCsFWU598y-KxsGJp2FLrPEDAh_w38b8YRoeLYCe_Rpfe6eo9skAV3w7IIAAs1w98MpMiRLONeFxdHtpW2XEywnGvP5HmbuLd7ToCDZiKimGFzdxHMQsp5mHCRpIHgSDo_RT_Jff2qRy3zgzgAw9h9fJUhCtkxtHwy-v2jrkDNBLuZEHmh2QBYVWmtj7_i8eFnNaIXRytdGXZIZ0HXj6xF7iKAdzZl6BQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIQZSEO3Wxw7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The picture also reminds one that ANC is a big party, and that no leader within the ANC is bigger than the organization itself.What's you interpretation of this picture? Comment below.
