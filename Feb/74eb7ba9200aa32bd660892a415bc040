After the resignation of Mzansi's former president, Jabob Zuma, a social media user posted a picture of himself wearing an ANC t-shirt, but Zuma's image had been cut out of the t-shirt.As quirky as this image is, it does send a strong message. There were many MEMEs after Zuma resigned, this one stood out to the #SunTeam.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstJVxj6tlfPj65f2R1F8ExU5JRf6UUELy3MZyZnckJZcDnk1xzS-bYgzmknQ_Sr_3g7jIddXILhLnM8wB2Bo9nhfoqyxcdtBMVB56TK8Cwp3iYkKMUdysbtVJ54FLnxRSxBIYDFIHyxHwM4Jcbom3y0DqtIqMsJ0qEW3TckI7uvHj_mEapd-y3cCBfNoIS_e7QtejKYhFcGdQJDwnLzDwmXn0a3SeIsx5brooSY0XsS03Sn9EC4V3GtV5KUcoXRezqF_adtaZlPqVRITxUoIjyKqu2usrcxPrYp7Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCaezY1kX0guEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The picture also reminds one that ANC is a big party, and that no leader within the ANC is bigger than the organization itself.What's you interpretation of this picture? Comment below.
