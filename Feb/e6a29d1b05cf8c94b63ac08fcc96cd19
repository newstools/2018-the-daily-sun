A CRAZY WORLD TOUR would BEYONCE, RIHANNA, BRUNO MARS, CHRIS BROWN.  “2 for 2,” Chris tweeted.What has everyone shook on social media is that Chris had the nerve to suggest this after he physically assaulted Rihanna in 2009.In 2009, on the night of the Grammy Awards, Chris and Rihanna got into an altercation which turned physical with Chris bashing Rihanna’s face into the dashboard of his car.Rihanna later opened an assault case against Chris, to which he pleaded guilty.Chris, who was 20-years-old at the time took a plea deal under which he had to serve five years of probation and 180 days in jail or the equivalent - about 1,400 hours - in "labor-oriented service," or community service.Twitter fans all over the world have been dragging Chris for his “delusional” and “problematic” sense of reality.Chris was also willing to have the tour happen without him, as long as they would pay him for the idea.“And if y’all decide to do it without me... give me 10%,” he said.Niether Rihanna, Beyonce, nor Bruno have responded to the suggestion.
