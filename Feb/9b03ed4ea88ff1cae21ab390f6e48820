REX Chabalala has a big problem. The 52-year-old from section F of Giyani, Limpopo is in desperate need of a job, but no one wants to hire him because he is blind in one eye. The father of three became partially blind when he was just a child. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvw4O9P-pPvNzdwpuFZ-xh4UQ1dSaBCtbUzn4renr0ww73-4uZYR2N7JSUhP6j323VqyjCiWMsPP1IZF-7oz250JwRQXxLehtdWLQ0RN6_OJn0hJcrIG7IVQ1D5DP_LW3pmgefB4-APoNMBYS7fxWptue85pW20f-trfq6zYPGT8WOMt4OhUK_GkD4chxW8FkQ510aE7L5uLXtwQP97YK9m323sHhajPy_R-VvCJ7UyvBXN0OHnYaR3K6iUzL66RzRO0PSdiEe-99vg019aUYojawesrcI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKJtXMlVfaF3EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He was a goat herder in his youth, until he moved to Gauteng in search of piece jobs. However, some of the jobs he did had the potential to blind his other eye, which was easily irritated by dust.“I went to an optometrist who suggested I see an opthalmologist, who treats disorders of the eye.“But I can’t afford to see the specialist unless I get a job. “I don’t have R1 000 to spend on an eye specialist. “I can barely afford to buy food.”If you would like to help Rex, please call optometrist Dr Godfrey Maringa on 078 215 5263.
