A family member, Nomzamo Bhengu (28) said no words could describe what they are going through. “We don’t know who to blame or who to ask questions because the person who did this was not mentally stable and he’s gone now,” said Nomzamo.She said the relative’s mental condition worsened on Saturday but they never thought it would go this far.“Even though he’d been showing signs of aggression since November, he had never laid a hand on anyone.”Nomzamo said their relative had been in and out of hospital but doctors couldn’t find what was wrong with him.She said they didn’t know whether he intended to run in front of a moving truck or whether it was an accident. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said two counts of murder and one of attempted murder were opened at Port Shepstone cop shop following the incident. “The suspect allegedly fled from the scene and was later knocked over by a truck. A case of culpable homicide was opened. It is not clear whether or not the suspect tried to commit suicide,” said Zwane.
