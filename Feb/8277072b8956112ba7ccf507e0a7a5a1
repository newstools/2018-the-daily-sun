They barricaded the school’s gate and surrounding roads in protest, demanding that education officials resolve the matter of overcrowded classes.They accused the department of neglecting the school and not keeping its promises. saying it was overcrowded and the village had no high school. Parent Matilda Oliphant (49) said no pupil would return to class until they saw trucks offloading building material. She said they had been too soft on the Department of Basic Education in North West. “The department doesn’t understand. They want to see the smoke of burning tyres before they come to the table and that is what we are going to give them,” she said. She said they had been complaining about the state of the school for more than 10 years.  She said their village had grown but the school had not changed since it was built years ago. “Mines have brought many people here, the school used to cater for less than 500 kids but today it has almost a thousand. Teachers can’t cope and this affects the performance of our kids,” she said. Matilda said if their strategy of protesting does not work, they will take their protest to the department’s Bojanala District offices. “That’s where we’re going get violent, burn tyres and take over the offices. Our children are not prioritised because children of officials go to private schools,” she said.A teacher, who wished not to be named, said most classrooms had 70 or 80 pupils. She said this disadvantaged the pupils and made teaching very difficult at the school.The North West Department of Basic Education’s Bayanda Zenzile said they were still investigating.She said they have send an inquiry to the Bojanala District to find out what is happening.
