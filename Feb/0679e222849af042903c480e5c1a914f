this move, calling it a tough choice and added that it was incompatible with a growing economy.
He told him to look at Zimbabwe as an example of how it
could end up. Malema then warned
Maimane that he would lose the Pretoria and Joburg metros, which the EFF is
helping the DA govern."Your stay in the metros is going to depend on your attitude
on the expropriation of land without compensation."I want to warn you about that....because it's an
issue that is going to make us fight with you."Because anyone opposed to expropriation of land
without compensation is the enemy of our people and such a person will be dealt
with," said Malema.Turing to president Ramaphosa, Malema told Ramaphosa:
"the issue of expropriation without compensation did not capture the
headlines because they know you are bluffing....they know you are not serious
about it."Anybody who is worried about investment in South
Africa would have been worried when you mentioned expropriation without
compensation."But you told them... I'm just passing time, don't
worry....well this cannot be an issue to bluff about, this cannot be an issue
to pass time about," said Malema.He said the land issue is emotive and "you only
mention it when you mean it..it's not a matter that you can go around joking
about it....there are no conditions attached to expropriation of land without
compensation because when they took our land they never attached any condition
they just killed our people."
