Dear MizzB I’M 24 years old and I’ve been dating my 19-year-old girlfriend for 10 months. She was raped just before I met her. I’ve been very patient but I get frustrated sometimes as her past is affecting us. She doesn’t want to kiss, hug or have sex with me. I love her, so how do I help her get over this? if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>- Frustrated Man Dear Frustrated ManI commend you for being supportive.
