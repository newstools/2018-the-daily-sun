But I want to be protected.”  The cop said it looked like the provincial police service was broke.  “They need to sort themselves out.  “This affects people on the ground who face danger every day.” She said management didn’t even bother to brief their commanders to speak to them.  “We just received emails and no briefing of any kind,” she said.  Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said if cops had concerns relating to their work they should follow correct procedures.  “This is an internal process and the concerned officers must raise it through the correct structures rather than running to the media.  “The media won’t sort out their grievances because they’re not even revealing who they are.”
