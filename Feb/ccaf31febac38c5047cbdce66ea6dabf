The prayers we conduct will turn Day Zero into a day of rising waters in Cape Town.”Pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng said the road to Cape Town’s redemption begins at his church tonight. “The meeting with God is critical. Before I start anything as big as this, I need to have a meeting with the creator, God. I plan to pray hard and I will make it rain.”He said his meeting will go on all night and everybody is welcome. On Wednesday, the prayers will continue in Cape Town.“The prayers are not about making Prophet Mboro popular. We are inviting all other religious leaders and people across the country to join the prayers on Wednesday in Cape Town.”He said the timeline for when the rain will hit the parched Cape earth can’t be discussed before his meeting with God. “God will reveal to me when He will bless the people with rain.” Mboro said he prayed for rain in Ekurhuleni, Vaal and the Free State when the provinces had the same problems.DA provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela said Cape Town needs more than prayers. “We welcome all people with any kind of help to assist with the crisis, but people must realise prayers alone are not the answer. The way people use water is the most important thing.” “People’s behaviour must change and they must get used to the hard times the city is experiencing.”He said each person was allowed to use 50 litres of water per day. “Experts have also warned residents there is no rain forecast,” he said. The Western Cape is working to at least keep water running at schools.
