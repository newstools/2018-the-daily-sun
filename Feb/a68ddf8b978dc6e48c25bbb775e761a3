RESEARCH by American scientists suggests that two glasses
of beer or wine a day and being a little overweight are the secrets to a longer
life.According to The
Sun, researchers analysed data on 14 000 people aged between 55 and 100.
Some they had been tracking for as long as 37 years. Among their findings are:if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>- Drinking beer or wine cuts the risk of dying young by a
fifth.- Being a bit overweight later in life makes an early
death 3% less likely.- Drinking two cups of coffee daily cuts the chances of
an early death by 10%, while 15 minutes of exercise a day cuts it by 11%.- Being involved with hobbies such as gardening, reading
or making things also reduces the risk of an early death, by as much as 21%.Study leader Professor Claudia Kawas from the University
of California is quoted in the report as saying: “People should try to
incorporate as many of these habits into their day to give themselves the best
chance of living to a ripe age.“But adopting this healthy lifestyle does not guarantee
that these extra years will be healthy ones.“Our data shows none of these lifestyle factors make any
difference to the likelihood you will develop dementia - we are still trying to
find them.”The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.
