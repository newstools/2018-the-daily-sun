Ntungufhadzeni Makhitha (36) have been indicted to stand trial  on 20 March 2018.The 19-year-old accused was  also declared unfit to possess a firearm.Mojapelo said the Task Team that was established to
investigate all public violence related crimes in Vuwani, is hard at work to
ensure that all responsible persons are brought to book. "During 2016 alone, the police have registered more
than hundred cases emanating from the Public Violence incidents that afflicted
several areas of Vuwani and sixty two 
suspects were subsequently arrested," said MojapeloHe said investigations into these cases are still
pending. This public violence led to unprecedented acts of
vandalism during which government and private properties were either torched or
severely damaged.The Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke
Ledwaba has hailed this team and encouraged it's members to leave no stone unturned
until all the perpetrators are prosecuted.
