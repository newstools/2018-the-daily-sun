also the Minister of Labour under the cabinet of the former President Nelson
Mandela and has held a number of advisory positions. In his tweet, Mboweni said they cannot recycle the same
people in the cabinet.It reads: (@tito_mboweni) “Against the wisdom of my Team,
please don’t tell them this. It’s between us, I am not available for Minister
of http://Finance.You  cannot recycle the
same people all over again. It is time for young people. We are available for
advisory roles. Not cabinet. We have done that.”Meanwhile President Cyril Ramaphosa is still expected to
announce his new cabinet. During the delivery of his state of the nation
address before a joint sitting of Parliament, Ramaphosa said he wants to reduce
the size of the cabinet and government departments.
