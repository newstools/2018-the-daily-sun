The world renowned film INXEBA has fueled criticism for misrepresenting cultural practices.The film follows a love queer of Isisxhosa initiates while at the initiation school. On the opening night of the movie Inxeba (The Wound), the Man and Boy Foundation and the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa), made a last-ditch effort to block the film from being shown — mobilising their members to stage sit-ins until their demands were met. M&G reported. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuXGiBEN2ew6RBtbOYwCNwcrGWu__wjfDJu6fzIOu3PoaQJmyiAlMKN_KWRuxXW0Psux0CHgBsXB6PuI0onaxftZKDHotLG9pY1Eyorg7GynGtJN8BB1lEcK-yR5DljLoX0KRwM45uFGZBJMw5ZwXkNEZdm26TLMtSy0iKW-zv0IxgKxMxFlNWGqwF8fa3BMXKkWf4LvL_t2qXAFzNMdvyxCAO_pKlw1OgqtQDvoBAAM5Ur2yYlphM72JGxAYKSxIhdfRi_tJ2OdoBmCPbVynAAa4gT9GrbNUG7rA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCcQOgGc5JEtEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

If you’ve booked, we will gladly refund you or exchange your tickets for another film—contact helpdesk@numetro.co.za. We will update you as the situation warrants.— Nu Metro Walmer Park (@numetrowalmer) February 2, 2018This has fueled a lot of controversy and here are the tweets from the people. Eastern Cape traditional leaders embarked on a march on Hemingways Cinema to block the premiere of #InxebaTheWound which is set to hit the big screens nationwide today. The marchers want the movie banned all over because it exposes a sacred Xhosa tradition. pic.twitter.com/yI49AY75XY— The Daily Dispatch (@Dispatch_DD) February 2, 2018I don't know how many times we must tell Xhosa men that the initiation secrets that they reveal themselves aren't revealed in #Inxeba I have a headache— ndizenza juicy (@Lulama__) February 2, 2018@numetro i need to ask security at the malls where @TheWound_SAfilm is showing tomorrow.We have already received threats of assault if we go— siphumle ntsokolo (@siphz) February 1, 2018The #Inxeba crew were smart enough to get all SAs celebs to spark the movie. I hope and pray inyembezi zika Somagwaza fall on all of them.
