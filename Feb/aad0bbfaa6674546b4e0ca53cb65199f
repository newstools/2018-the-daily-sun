The world renowned film INXEBA has fueled criticism for misrepresenting cultural practices.The film follows a love queer of Isisxhosa initiates while at the initiation school. On the opening night of the movie Inxeba (The Wound), the Man and Boy Foundation and the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa), made a last-ditch effort to block the film from being shown — mobilising their members to stage sit-ins until their demands were met.
