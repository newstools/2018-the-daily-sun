"Intra-Africa trade generated a total of 46 732 jobs in the Gauteng economy.""All key players in the economy including labour, business and consumers are willing to work together under the leadership of President Ramaphosa to get South Africa working so that we can get our economy to work for all our people," Makhura said.He said under his leadership, there will be improvement on the life of the citizens living in Gauteng which will include strengthening accountability and integrity of public officials.However, he further mentioned that Gauteng runs the second largest public education system after Kwa-Zulu Natal, with enrolment having grown from 1.3 million in 1994 to 2.3 million in 2018."As part of preparing our children for a better future, the Gauteng Provincial Government has achieved 95% universal access to Grade R," He said.Meanwhile, he also added that over the past five years, the Gauteng government has spent R1 billion on bursaries which have benefitted more than 20 000 graduates.
