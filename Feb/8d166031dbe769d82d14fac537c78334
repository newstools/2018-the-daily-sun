He said: “It was discovered that a sewage pump had failed and this resulted in a spillage that affected a nearby house. The pump was repaired.“Unfortunately, when we sent a team to clean the house afterwards the owners had already cleaned up and locked the premises. “The municipality regrets this incident and urges residents to report any leakages to 0800 100 100.”
