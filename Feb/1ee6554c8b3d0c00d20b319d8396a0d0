IT seems former TV presenter Nonhle Thema has seen the light. According to insiders, the former host of Channel O’s entertainment TV shows, O-Boma and O-Access, is on the road to becoming a pastor. And she’s doing her training at Rhema Church, the well-placed informants claimed. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Said the first source: “She’s changed her life around and seen the light. Nonhle has been attending classes to be a pastor at her church.” The source didn’t know when the sexy ex-TV host began training, but was adamant Nonhle would be ordained later this year. Another source said the rumoured former party girl, who allegedly lost it all, had dumped the material things of this world in favour of Jesus. Insisted the congregant: “She’s not ashamed to share her story of how she fell from fame.” The informant even praised Nonhle for being involved in many church activities, including hosting prayers and connect groups. “We’re proud of her, she’s come a long way. I like how she decided to follow and accept Jesus as her saviour,” the source said. “I wish many young women, like her, would also follow in her path.” The third mole said Nonhle was now surrounded by positive role models and “people who have a great influence on her”. “She has brilliant mentors and influential women around her. We’re talking about business-minded people here and women who fear God, which is a pretty good structure for her.” According to the source, Nonhle had also shifted her focus to raising “her beautiful daughter”, guiding her through Christ’s teaching and keeping her away from the destractions of this world. Pondered the source: “She’s come a long way. Better still, she’s not bitter about whatever she went through and takes it as a blessing in disguise that she now knows the Lord.” When called for her account of these alleged good developments, Nonhle refused to comment. The Rhema Church was also not available for comment.
