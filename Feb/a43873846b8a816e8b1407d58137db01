on normalising the situation at the police station so that it continues to
offer quality service to [the] Engcobo community," he said.Tonjeni said the top brass from the national and
provincial offices had visited Ngcobo to pay their respects to the families of
the officers who were killed.Tonjeni said the visit followed words of condolences from
