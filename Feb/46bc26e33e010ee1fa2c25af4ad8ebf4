And of course they could not provide me with reasons so i refused to resign," said Zuma.He says they only told him that there was a good mood in the country and that it must be maintained."No one has told me what wrong have i done," said Zuma. He says he had sent the NEC back to tell the working committee to tell them he has refused the persuasion. He says the ANC decided to recall Mbeki because there was a "specific" the ANC NEC. Zuma says the "Zuma must go" slogan is not a new thing as it has been there even last year.He admitted to have asked the top six to allow him to resign after June so that he could introduce Cyril to Brics and the SADEC. But this was rejected.Throughout the interview Zuma kept on maintaining that the call for him to resign was baseless.  He suggested the some comrades may have a problem with him being removed and therefore this might lead to a crisis."I think we’re being plunged into a crisis that I’m sure my comrades will regret," said Zuma.He promised he is going to make a statement late on Wednesday.
