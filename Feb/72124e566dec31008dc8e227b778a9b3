Mzansi stage and television actor Athandwa Kani, who has been living in the United States for quite some time has said that the american accent that he has picked up during his lengthy stay there will help him get more international roles.Athandwa said on Metro FM that he did not want to be that actor who becomes strongly identified with a specific character, instead he would like to also be able to play other characters that require an American accent."In reality, if I am going to forge a life for myself this side and I am insistent on keeping a South African accent, I am only going to play a refugee - the guy who gets shot in the head in the second scene. I am going to play general Mfumfu. I want much more than that" he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstS5CGV2r02r75FifLZdvK7q16Q4xNs__7OX8sKIzL4qDGvWEJ3BJfr7o3hj5wWnlC0k97DDmRtftWkecU501jUgwzVdvt-hWLLRGQ6LIbWtRBj-gjAST1H213V6bZCZKeLNrq3N_mSADYpq97XjNgImrq9L_fNWJKix8Dw8ODrOB3L01cnBbdJ3xMLDwfYO3SL20MgUBN5Bdwod2WdxwnjVPcGsG0vuoUQsqDZKrAW3fQKCQZ5cTGgO_lYJKdn2S-cKgmDN3v4t1I7iqOlHzcuDNs0VqfC1GCneg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzF56U9qMJobyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I was raised by an amazing giant of an actor (John Kani) who has conquered the world, but I want so much more for myself. I want to play, like, Denzel Washington's nephew and pull it off. I want to have the lead role alongside Idris Elba. My father once taught me that if you want to impress and be in a position of power, learn the waltz better than they do it. That is when they will respect you and look at you" he said.
