MAVIS Mkhonto said she is tired of being sent by doctors from pillar to post. Worse still, the doctors apparently told her they couldn’t help her because she’s too old.  The 52-year-old gogo from Merry Pebble Stream Trust outside Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, said her hip started hurting in December 2015.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvdlP7eZaf455Z64gA1KSpqimZAHNRPpexl4U1oD_n6dXkR6-18kgf5gTYiKFVe3FBawDmGhObgucsK8rcV8hf9FJWr2nqDJfZ--QO1yLwEszwpcm0DTXZTHi2puAXbV3jnP8QCy999YX8CIkABBcUWTP0fKi4oYU8TdmoINaIINp7kUkzPB57h4VpeP0ziNObWvCMb-U1V707Y0qNkGqAwFoueYvU8eSm1ZzQV-vL9lgMoM4pnzn4Lu5LVq-f-VE5s2-B1__JlUIknKgvRttgD6EZE2PA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMgvhbKInHGTEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Mavis said doctors told her she would have to go for a hip replacement operation, but she has been waiting since and can’t handle the pain anymore. “I’ve been to Sabie Hospital as well, but doctors told me they couldn’t help me because I’m too old. “I use crutches and was told the department had no money to perform the operation.  “This is not easy for me. The pain gets worse every day. I’m old and I can’t afford medical aid.  “I just wish the department could speed up the process and finalise my operation.” Mpumalanga Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said Mavis is on the waiting list. “She was seen by a specialist from Rob Ferreira Hospital and is waiting for an operation date,” he said.  “The operation will be conducted at the same tertiary hospital.”
