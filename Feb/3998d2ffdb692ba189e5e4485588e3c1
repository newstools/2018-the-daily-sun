Mofokeng made pupils aware of the danger of buying suspected stolen property from unknown people. “In most cases, the owners of those items that you buy were robbed and could even have been murdered,” said Mofokeng. The youngsters were warned that if they were found with stolen property, they would be arrested. Thakeng said they also advised the youngsters to mark their property, write the serial numbers down and keep their receipts safe. He also mentioned the career options available in the police service. He said young people could work in the corporate communications, finance, supply chain management or human resources departments. The detective services, K9 unit, public order policing and the tactical response team also had vacancies on offer.
