Last Sunday apostle Paul Kamba of Destiny Midwives Christian Centre in Edenvale was shot in church. He also died at Tembisa Hospital.Pastor Tumelo’s mother, Maaki Mpolweni, said she was with her son. She said: “We’d just arrived at church where he was to conduct an all-night prayer session when we saw a white car pulling up on the side of the road.“I thought the two men inside were coming there for prayers. But they were actually evil men sent by Satan.” Maaki said a man in the passenger seat came straight for her son and pulled out a gun. “I fell on the floor and started praying hard to God for the men to spare our lives. But then I heard repeated gunshots directed at my son.” She said though the family is shattered, they are happy that Pastor T – as Tumelo was fondly called – died like a soldier on the war front. “He was a true messenger of God who loved everyone and was loved by many.” Portia Mthombeni, the pastor’s sister-in-law, said Tumelo was a family man who loved his wife and children. “He leaves behind a three-month-old baby,” she said.Tembisa police spokeswoman Constable Patricia Mgijima said police are looking for suspects in both incidents. “Anyone with information should contact the nearest police station.”
