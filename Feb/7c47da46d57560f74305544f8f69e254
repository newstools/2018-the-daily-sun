He said Rachel was the first patient to be taken to hospital by helicopter due to riots in the area. A relieved Rachel said she was happy a helicopter came to her rescue. “There are protests in our area and the ambulance could not come to fetch me. Nurses at the clinic told me I needed to be rushed to hospital,” she said.“I heard one of the nurses saying my baby’s heartbeat wasn’t normal. I was then taken to hospital by the chopper. “It was my first time flying and I’m happy that everything went well.”She said she had not yet named her daughter.QwaQwa residents want mayor Vusi Tshabalala to step down.
