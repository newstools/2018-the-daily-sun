ALTHOUGH he’s under pressure, Bloemfontein Celtic head coach Veselin Jelusic is not pressing any panic buttons in light of his team’s recent dismal form. Following their 4-2 defeat to SuperSport United in an Absa Premiership clash at Lucas Moripe Stadium at the weekend, Phunya Sele Sele have now gone five matches without a win.They conceded 10 goals in those matches, which should be of concern to Celtic’s management, despite Jelusic saying he has the board’s support.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsupfSbRUTvSDExpb9jPt7rnxDPwNjXc8H77cdvml9VUCEzdVRvj1az-SvmT2iNlHbY5WZ8iKCIp6_3avTtK7HT22iHY6cJR2vVCTa_r-4Dp5XWIur25hz6gtRIpLPsVymfVrn7ulHHlyHZDIVywPNorhVL7zE2p_nVPg_znDmOCQsLGv4vNXpENPAaL8VS9VdvrnRnjFEkZs-IOHyWH1n20fz4y2RRY2sEft9Teoavm5Q5jKoI6XQZkBbKb4YMGtSMSDAnb3s9NIiz4vvBKBqLP8w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEpM1WkKptt_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

This means the Free State side are not safe from the axe and will need to fight to get the points they need to survive. But looking at their performance and their leaky defence it will not be easy to retain their PSL status come end of season unless Jelusic changes his approach – and fast.“I am happy at Celtic, as I have the support of everybody, from the management to the players, my assistants coaches and the fans,” he said.The Serbian coach attributes their defeat to Eric Tinkler’s United to individual errors. Celtic will have the chance to avenge that defeat when the teams battle it out again in a Nedbank Cup Last 32 clash at Dr Molemela Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm)“We started the game well and created some good chances,” said Jelusic. “We conceded goals through some serious individual errors. One of their goals was an intercept and the other happened because my defence failed to mark the opponent. “We tried to come back but couldn’t. Congratulations to SuperSport. I hope we do better in our next meeting.”
