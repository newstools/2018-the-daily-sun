And, with Valentine’s Day upon us, we know that young people might be tempted to do things that might have negative long-term effects for them.”He urged youngsters to remain virgins as long as possible because, according to the MEC, that is they key to realising their potential and safeguarding their future.“On Valentine’s Day and beyond, we are saying to young women in particular that the men who sleep with them do not do so out of love, but out of lust,” said the MEC.He said young people at institutions of higher learning are at risk of unplanned pregnancies or contracting HIV. “Those who cannot abstain from sex should rather use dual protection, which is a combination of medical male circumcision and condoms, during every sexual episode. “Women can combine this with contraceptive methods,” he said.Dhlomo condemned transaction relationships and urged young women to be wary of older men who promise to give them money in exchange for sex.“Young women are especially at risk of contracting an STI when they sleep with a blesser.“These old men are the ones who infect young women with HIV. “In turn, these women pass on the virus on to young men.”The MEC’s warning came during STI/Condom and Pregnancy Awareness Week, which started on Saturday and will end on Friday.The initiative is a health awareness campaign that promotes safe sex and seeks to curb the spread of STIs.Ayanda Msomi (25) from Umbumbulu, south of Durban, said she conceived her first child on Valentine’s Day when she was a teenager.She said: “The MEC’s warning was a good idea. “I don’t want young women to go through what I did.”
