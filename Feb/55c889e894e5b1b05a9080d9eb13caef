Addressing a briefing at the commission’s offices in Braamfontein, Joburg, commissioner Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said problems included property owners denying people access to graves and a lack of municipal land for burials. “The right of families to access their ancestors is denied by some farm owners under the pretext of private property,” she said.Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said that because there were many farm murders happening in the country, many farmers said they were now afraid to allow strangers access to their properties. “We will establish a framework ensuring safe access for people and the safety of farm owners,” she said.
