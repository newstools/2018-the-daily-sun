This was after he bought alcohol to celebrate Christmas and said they both were drunk when they had sex.“She asked me to take her to the toilet and I was shocked when she pushed me down, not wearing any underwear. So I penetrated her but I didn’t ejaculate inside her. That’s why I was shocked when I heard she was pregnant,” he told the court. “I wish the court would release me so that I could sit down with my daughter and family to explain myself and ask for forgiveness,” he said.Constable Norah Dumisa told the court that paternity test results showed that the man was the biological father of the foetus that was removed.The stepmother of the victim said on several occasions she had caught her husband and her stepdaughter having sex, but both told her to leave them alone.Theron urged the community to continue blowing the whistle and reporting such cases. “Fathers should be the ones to protect their children, not to rape them. This court has found you guilty and sentences you to life imprisonment. Your name will be written in the national sexual offender’s register.”
