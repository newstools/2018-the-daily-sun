TWO cops in Port Elizabeth dealt drug dealers a major blow last week when they seized millions of rands worth of zol.Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said: “Police were patrolling the N2 on Thursday when they spotted a suspicious minibus. They followed the vehicle and stopped it on the bridge near Swartkops.“After questioning the driver, they found about 42 large bags of dagga in the minibus. The dagga weighed about 1040kg and had an estimated value of R2,5 million. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested and will appear in the Paterson Magistrates Court today.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvlJKU-5mcHJGK8MJ_iFjLZ9s154SP7a3A79tRNRxOyP-b2DnJeBSj4QZU4jJ82HLBQcy7_MRlFAIg5e5IksemyeTb6mnrfKUo5yJ1FNLlI2Mste7jUrl--XN5h5t0Lj4QdnRIBlw472fNFIOjz4Yl9HJusPRc3z40rJoDUlN1uZ2eB3cgnoleashLG6cqLG96O98kcv4MstPae6IWQSqOvjvPBGoqG8tZGKq_v7czIzClDcLGu45w8pi5QlMxc5EIRqn3SuYs0E3DMBhqmdoqLBDX7O2M\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKY_q6Yjgp-NEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They arrested two suspects in Colchester and found three bags of dagga in their vehicle. The dagga weighed about 115kg and had an estimated street value of R350 000.”But on Saturday a cop sustained an injury while trying to arrest a suspect for drug possession. “Police were conducting stop and search operations in Helenvale when a suspect resisted arrest and an angry mob started throwing stones at the officers.“One officer was wounded on his forehead and two police vehicles were damaged. Police have opened cases of assault and malicious damage to property.”
