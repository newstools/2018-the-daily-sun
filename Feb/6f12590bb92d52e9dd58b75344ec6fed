TWO cops in Port Elizabeth dealt drug dealers a major blow last week when they seized millions of rands worth of zol.Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said: “Police were patrolling the N2 on Thursday when they spotted a suspicious minibus. They followed the vehicle and stopped it on the bridge near Swartkops.“After questioning the driver, they found about 42 large bags of dagga in the minibus. The dagga weighed about 1040kg and had an estimated value of R2,5 million. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested and will appear in the Paterson Magistrates Court today.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuvfdzl0m1CUiBHBlmVVZIF7tTzkPZL_eOvFqJSUtebbp7vv1HHe9H48C2k4giuy7Jaok-89_swXkfKq4XWSwTFuV9rd0-O_FJ2axd-9ten404qd2zPOqtwYXvMrb_3QHJmgUxtIqT0qDCoCdYkbj51vRXvcL2rwjFD407t9Wb9ClPvRYCbaB-JvGLjrdA-ncftWQ2dHn44rxHZCICbBjOrsrWmTCSoiL-tfxgzpYV8LDOoVVKCf_Dbj42tTy1xy06f6eOGlvBUUdlUkxESZXzpB1mG01c\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCktPga_PHqYEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
