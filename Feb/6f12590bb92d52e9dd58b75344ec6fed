They followed the vehicle and stopped it on the bridge near Swartkops.“After questioning the driver, they found about 42 large bags of dagga in the minibus. The dagga weighed about 1040kg and had an estimated value of R2,5 million. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested and will appear in the Paterson Magistrates Court today.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvzDi6nhCVqr-V9hSJ9BbNq3cgDNjn1DQy43JIULtT04eS5BOK9DHdAlCdEoZNzzkoH9PhEMQCNqccWD8ujg1le1jiISUu9jGgURhZinHt0T8M_VYh7pHU9PfqlZwOY3jd7sCCwpz5lL0ccIoP4cSw4beuwqPRI8JrvBGgZIU8Nhg7eiyvekZcZckEbYE_uq_HXHqdQHojzqILfSuMr-YDwnzLb6Uzv5K8PgZSUwXE7tUHR-8MIu5_uuflybD1xQvn4wf3TfiDOS7VnatTVdJw9Po0qfR4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGQcLuO6HI8HEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
