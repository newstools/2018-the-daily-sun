KWANYUSWA residents used to travel 16km to the Durban CBD to use the internet. Realising how this ate into their pockets, Linda Bulose decided to made their lives less stressful by bringing the internet closer.The 47-year-old local said the idea of starting the KwaSondela internet cafe came to him in 2015 after seeing how residents spent all their time and money travelling. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu3NfvpnhIoSZnsUyzRe5ol4-B1LHS711hq6qVToQ06c1vLpZrUhn7tdFJ2jBrMJWlwr8-w20JoDKkIHeKVHRkdIXMRsBbVstStzNvz0k8JldaV4lOOaaRtfAxTviRhOjPjCzC5RzvgTnZSRyruxOTILZgvDeoTqqVBpt6v8idX72BpV83VzxqwauhoxTSV2q1QpMWXK5XGajFjqRB4af5gz3lcKMz3ueYJ3fPwGOE5Bmyczgn87elmUTZErg1_61h_BmJEDCRFrYKoyBgScSH4g69miVs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKHA88N0MSpHEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I’ve employed three people because I’m busy.“Sithembiso Sithole makes sure people are able to do everything they need and runs the place in my absence,” Linda said.He said students do assignments there and high school pupils do research and homework.“The busiest times are mornings and afternoons. In the morning, people make copies and others work on CVs they need to send off. The same happens in the afternoon when pupils return from school. We only rest on Sundays. “Even the drivers come to browse the internet during off-peak times. Everyone benefits from the cafe.” Linda’s dream now is to build a computer centre in the area.
