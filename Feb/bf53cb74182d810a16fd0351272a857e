The only thing you need is courage and the willingness to work hard.”She said at first they struggled to get bags to put the bottles and tins in, but then they found out where to get them for free. “We collect many bottles and tins when there are festivals or weddings in the area. We also walk around nearby areas collecting bottles and tins.”She said the money they make helps to feed their kids and pay the bills.“We have hired another woman and expect to hire more once our business has grown,” Mantoa told the People’s Paper.Metsi said their aim was to open a recycling company themselves one day.“We want to help unemployed people in our area, especially women,” Metsi told Daily Sun.
