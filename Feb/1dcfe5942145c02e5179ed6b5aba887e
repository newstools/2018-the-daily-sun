She then took all my furniture, her clothes – and my manhood. “She told me she would make sure that I never slept with anyone again,” he said.Zecharia said since then all his relationships haven’t been working out. “My 4-5 dies as soon as I am with a woman. I am as good as useless. “I found a new girl but I’m scared of being hurt again. “I’ll wait until I fix my problem,” he said.When Daily Sun contacted Salphina she denied locking his 4-5. She said: “I dumped him because he was abusive. He used to beat me up. I couldn’t take it anymore so I left. “I don’t give money to sangomas for a stupid man like him. I’m a security officer struggling to raise children. How would I be able to pay a sangoma?” she asked.Sibongile Dlamini, a traditional healer, said Zacharia’s problem is easy to fix but he needs to find someone who will tell him the root cause.
