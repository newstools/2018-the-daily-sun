Why is it that the same government that encourages the youth to make use of free Wi-Fi does not update the application process for jobs in the public sector?Government departments still insist that you apply for a job by delivering physical copies of your application and identity document.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Why is this still happening when it is much easier to send the documents via email? Why doesn’t our government follow the example of the private sector and become more environmentally friendly? Printing and posting documents costs a lot of money and most young people can’t afford to do that indefinitely. Besides, most of the forms pile up in government offices because too many people apply. In some cases, the security guards stationed at your prospective employer’s gate instruct you to throw your application form onto a pile of documents scattered all over the floor. This is unprofessional and discouraging. What is the point of having free Wi-Fi if we can’t use it to apply for jobs? Our leaders must urgently look into this matter.It’s time to step into the 21st century and do away with practices that belong in the Stone Age.This letter/ opinion piece was submited by SunLander, Christopher Mazibuko from Soshanguve
