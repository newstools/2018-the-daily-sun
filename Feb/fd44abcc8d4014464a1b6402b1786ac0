On Saturday, a truck heading to Somerset was hijacked again, but the meat was recovered within an hour.Reghardt Gouws, a wholesale manager at the company, told Daily Sun: “From last year we experienced numerous hijackings and we have lost more than R4 million in the process. “We were suspicious that our drivers were hijacking themselves. “On Saturday, our driver told us he was hijacked in KwaZakhele and we wondered what was he doing in the area. “We viewed the tracking device and discovered that the truck was never hijacked. “It stopped at the back of a shop in KwaZakhele and the meat was offloaded into the bakkie. The truck was then abandoned on the old Uitenhage road. “We are losing sales and the meat is supposed to be on shelves, but ends up somewhere in the location.”Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said: “I can confirmed that two suspects were arrested after being found in possession of 2,7 tons of stolen meat with an estimated value of R140 000. “The truck belonging to Lentaba Meat was allegedly hijacked at about 8.30am.”The suspects will appear in court soon.
