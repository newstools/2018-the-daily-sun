ACCORDING to sangomas, a snake in a JoJo tank is causing chaos at this school. This comes after teaching and learning at Senzangakhona Secondary School was brought to a halt by a murder. A pupil at the school in Mandela Village, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, last month stabbed a classmate to death during a fight for a chair. Parent Moses Mdluli (46) told Daily Sun they would not risk their children’s lives until the evil snake was taken out of the water tank. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssGrtmrM03JT2oI71yNWN7ED1jkX4_3ZtVqP0KIdhfkkc5XMmjnM15oIoXVZ1qeRv1MXUTGlXg3gTSWck3B_wdNNEGi4fujHBbSTfSr8AbvVjT5KNWtaZSkn1qNOnqdbBmG4dfv40LKiPC5ncD_-QWO5ETE31iNLCZ5XQerXVg1E0DrZtbIwf-En4jNU3lPJtp4VuO2SvTxbI5m99t1tLoOfiGZcmLWn-lIMquPA0joYOy0ssMbYcoQxWSp24u0l4j-ujMRiv80NeZ5OTGS6E8GnQ5y68U\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHnsfprpdQGmEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He said the department had sent officials to talk to the parents and children to tell them to stop carrying weapons. “Teaching has been restored and we are happy about that. “The department will continue to monitor the situation closely.”
