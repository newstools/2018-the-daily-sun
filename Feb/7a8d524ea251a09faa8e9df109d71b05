She did this while also running a book club for kids between four and 14 from her family home. Her book was launched last year in Joburg and will also be available in Cape Town and Durban. The book tells the story of Lira, her family and a cat that is ugly, dirty and always hungry. Brand South Africa has profiled the young author and she was also featured in the Top 10 South African Heroes in The Star in November. Suzette van der Merwe, managing executive for social investment at Cell C, said: “Cell C was delighted to contribute towards the print run of another 1 000 copies to help with its distribution.”
