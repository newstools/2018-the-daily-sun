GOLDEN Arrows defender Limbikani Mzava has urged his teammates to man up and start collecting those elusive points to avoid the team getting dragged further into the relegation zone. Their stuttering form so far this season has seen Abafana Bes’thende win only four out of 21 matches.Their downfall has been too many draws (11), resulting in them sinking into the drop zone. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvw1JnvVB3kpIlMlRDpuwMSj0KaHxQZ9tkWV1kfQKM7dVYsPM8iSTdBRFN-nR37_WJmDwHUGz5sgibfAStOeeEVa3I7FDr5IvWgrITeJp-LZbWoDbps-6_BerZET3T_IR2thTO4vS63X6AMLkIgw2QQKiyyeNcZQaWtdMIZs7apv0VX_sk6jmfB0CloAoYPjqI6Amk_eecnVzrARjSvWykOLoOt-jSgJpQt_pXJ-nPUCHbXAyNwsTqwBC3Ly8bxNnuVrhwDU0gmxGAdybHoN9KiFw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGlV26wjxlaLEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He said winning two or three matches in a row would change everything.Said Mzava: “If we keep it tight at the back we have a better chance of winning matches. I would be very worried if we were in this situation due to bad football. But we are playing good football – no team has outplayed us. “In my opinion we just lack luck, that’s all. We have nine matches to go and lots of points to play for. All we need now is to man up and start making our own luck. “On the pitch everyone needs to be a soldier and fight for the team. I know we are capable of that.”Arrows’ next match is at home against struggling Ajax Cape Town at Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu on Sunday (3.30pm). The Malawian says this match presents them with a good chance to get that elusive win.In their last five outings they have won only once – the match against SuperSport United. That was only their second victory at home this season. They will be seeking their third against 15th-placed Urban Warriors.“The good thing is that teams below us in the standings are not doing well either. That also encourages us.“Sunday’s match is a must-win for us. I’ve have played for two other teams in South Africa – Bloemfontein Celtic and Mpumalanga Black Aces – and I’ve never found myself in a relegation position with either of them. “I want to keep that good record with Arrows. We will not be dragged further down. Everyone is focused and understands what is at stake. We will fight for our team until the end. Relegation is not on our minds,” added Mzava.
