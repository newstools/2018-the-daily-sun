However, when Luzipo asked Speaker Baleka Mbete for clarity on the matter, he learnt there was no plenary session at the council and that the first sitting was scheduled for 7 March.MPs asked the chairman to subpoena Zwane because this isn’t the first time he has failed to appear before the committee. However, Luzipo argued against a subpoena. He said Zwane would be given an opportunity to answer questions on Wednesday.EFF MP Thembinkosi Rawula accused Zwane of wasting their time and said a commission of inquiry was the only reasonable solution. Rawula said the inquiry would be the perfect place for Zwane to respond to the allegations levelled against him.“We have given up on the idea of Zwane answering questions in parliament. “We’ll have a word with him at the commission of inquiry.” DA MP James Lorimer, who also called for an inquiry to be instituted, said it was the first time he’d agreed with the EFF.Zwane was supposed to appear before the committee on 28 November but claimed he was sick and asked for the sitting to be postponed for a day. The following day, he called in sick again but attended an ANC conference in the Free State. The minister also failed to appear before the committee last Wednesday, claiming he was busy with exams.The date for the commencement of the inquiry has not been announced.
