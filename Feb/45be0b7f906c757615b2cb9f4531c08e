SACP first deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila is urging ANC office bearers to fire President Jacob Zuma at once.Speaking yesterday during the Joe Slovo memorial lecture in Swartruggens, North West, Mapaila said Zuma thinks he is a super president and is holding the country to ransom. He said Zuma had turned against his people. “We have the right to fully disagree with him as he protects criminals, breaks the law and does not uphold the ANC value systems.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Mapaila fears that if the party loses power next year, SA will be like other African countries and fail. Other alliance partners also supported the SACP and are angry that Zuma is refusing to leave office. Sanco’s Packett Seaketso did not understand why Zuma could not go, like Thabo Mbeki was removed weeks after the 2007 conference.
