Mabe is serving his second term as a member of the national executive council of the ANC.He has been a member of the NEC’s subcommittee on communications since 2012.He has a bachelor of technology in journalism from the Tshwane University of Technology.He also completed a two-year executive development programme with Unisa. He’s currently completing a masters degree in business leadership.He also served as a member of parliament after the 2014 general elections and resigned from his position last year.Asked about his new job, Mabe told Daily Sun: “It comes with its own responsibilities. It’s going to be a learning curve.”He said it’s the collective and the NEC whose views must find expression. “I think what’s important is to be able to communicate resolves of the collective fairly and in an open manner.”Last year, Daily Sun reported that Mabe had survived an attempt on his life in Limpopo.
