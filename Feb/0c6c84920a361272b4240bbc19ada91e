STAVING off relegation is not Free State Stars’ priority this season.Qualifying for the top eight is the new target for Ea Lla Koto as they head into their last 10 league matches.According to Stars coach, Luc Eymael, the perennial strugglers now have far bigger ambitions than to merely preserve their PSL status.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu5MlEry6fWI99oGs4keOklt7Hj7Ds8n0Ph-OCO350QQEtmDoHFsxWUZ2r1RZjDeqvyJeem0TrFWnbepKP6jk8t_mf0D9j27F1TZYWb06AK1GE6Nn70AcV87mi6hhDIOOtXmzxfPbvHTLw2fJBZ6X_SvvS104kiMRJAzP3a_JbfVL0Z-y-PTAwqXuK0KctbYKJdtdBMsUG17-j3KTSz5NilXgcGR4ccslkYhH46aMzi2gZUsBo7CDnljA2Yy5Eps5UjY3C70zmvYN5fmTbPqQz3OA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJUBUxuVdzYsEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But one thing is for sure: Stars are not getting relegated,” said Eymael.“The target now is the top eight. We need another nine or 10 points to achieve that. If we can collect these points as soon as possible we’ll certainly cement our place. I don’t have any mandate – it’s our target as a team.”Mosimane has paid tribute to Eymael for his incredible work in lifting Stars from their customary danger spot in the relegation zone to lofty heights in the Absa Premiership table.Even though the Belgian is flattered, he is not blinded by the praise. “I also have a lot of respect for coach Pitso. He is the former Caf Coach of the Year and has done well with Sundowns,” said Eymael.“Of course we are expecting a tough game. I mean, they are the former Caf and Super Cup champions. They have a big squad, in numbers and quality. They lead the table and will certainly look to increase the gap at the top. “In my first game here, we lost to Sundowns. Percy Tau scored twice. But you can’t focus on one player. They also have  (Themba) Zwane, Khama Billiat, (Jeremy) Brockie?.?.?.” Sundowns lead the standings with 38 points, six clear of fourth-placed Stars, but Mosimane is unfazed by the challenge.Said Mosimane: “We’ve been here all these years. Yes, we are nervous – it’s human. You can’t tell me (Floyd) Mayweather doesn’t think before a fight that someone could throw a lucky punch and knock him out. We must guard against that. When you stop being nervous about an upcoming game, that’s when you become complacent. “We have to be very careful but execute well. The big players know what to do in such situations.”Like this story?
