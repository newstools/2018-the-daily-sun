A cop said Monyaki had arrived in his VW Polo at about 7.30pm when four armed men stormed their house.“The men demanded the keys to the safe. When the wife couldn’t help them, they ordered her to cover herself with a bunch of clothes. They then grabbed the cop and the safe was opened before an argument started. “The cop was shot and the thugs took his service pistol, a plasma TV and three phones before fleeing in the couple’s car.”Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said Monyaki was stationed at Bainsvlei cop shop.She said the same suspects fatally shot another man and committed a number of robberies in Kagisanong.“Anyone with information should call Lieutenant-Colonel Tankiso Sefuthi on 071 411 7650,” she said.
