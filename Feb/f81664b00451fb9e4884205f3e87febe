found themselves caught up in, not one, but two accidents during their journey.The first incident occurred while the Translux bus was travelling on
the N2, near Mthatha on Sunday afternoon and the bus driver had to swerve
suddenly for a stray animal in the middle of the road, Department of Health
spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said.In the process, the bus tipped over and landed on its side.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv2mTsYHkbVZemdNxwHgDkhMuIvSfpy2uAE6mDEGWlC7g-VmvHuRR9TJ_mNLRODVIsr4yGLysxw6nJmbKXp0pq-C6b4aXJd4V21mkSDYuJsaPqTMq9gYrVGEFFs_EHfhfjRE3MRpDJ5KiLh20CVSKgzVgIXToNA_E-xKIwvUNFW01icenx6_4ATjU2cZ3n2RwP12ZDwp3PIsnQLQ5VYq9Wc_EIwaw_bH4yJeCLvMuMjkQf9ctNEPxL6PRAQ_oblzBIxST85ji5hCxdlevYcBgdzASSrjAM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCDWW3uGlimpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
