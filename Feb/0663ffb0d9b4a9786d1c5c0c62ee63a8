I will also go to Mozambique to discuss this matter with the relevant security officials,” he said.During the protest, which started last Sunday, 10 people were arrested and charged will public violence. They were released without having to pay bail.Xolani Mkhombo (41) said the community is looking forward to the day Mbalula returns to their village. “We want to know how the stolen cars will be returned to their owners,” he said.
