Trying to break into the industry, trying to show people what you’re about. You know people give her a hard time but she just keeps pushing and keeps her eye on the prize,” Lerato said.In 2016 Lerato shared with True Love Magazine that she was called "the Soweto Bonang" said she was done with talking about the comparison. "I find it weird that people never ask her about me, but I'm the one that has to constantly answer questions about her. I'm happy I can finally confidently refuse to talk about her now. Before, I felt I needed to prove my character and work. Now, I'm living my life and not bothered by such comparisons," she explained to the magazine at the time.Lerato has been nominated for the SAFTAs12 under the category "Best Presenter" for Live Amp.
