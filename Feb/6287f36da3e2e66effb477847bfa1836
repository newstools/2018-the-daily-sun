But now we have to take a taxi and a bus, which means we pay twice,” he said. Thabo said the municipality has failed to follow Batho Pele principles.Maria Nkabinde (53) said she was not allowed to get on the bus with boxes of bananas.“I’m a vendor. I make a living by selling bananas and if I’m not allowed to travel with my goods, how will I provide for my family?” Protesters said they gave the city seven days to respond to their demands or they would hold a follow-up march.City of Tshwane Infrastructure MMC Michael Mukhari accepted the memorandum on behalf of the municipality.
