Lately they’re winning matches by big margins at home and my players will need to be on high alert. “Fadlu Davids has done a good job with his team. It’s always a pleasure to play against them as we always have a free flowing game.”The Usuthu coach gave his players a few days off after their hard-fought win on penalties against National First Division side Mthatha Bucks in the Nedbank Cup Last 32. The teams were locked at 2-2 after extra-time.Added Johnson: “It was important for my players to recuperate. I gave them two days off and could see the difference. They are refreshed and looking forward to the Maritzburg United match. “We have already collected four points from our neighbours. We have played Arrows twice, we lost one and won the other. Maritzburg took a point from us in the first round. This time I hope we will be able to come back with at least a point.”
