SADIO Mane grabbed a hat-trick and Mohamed Salah scored with a mesmerising piece of ball-juggling as Liverpool demolished Porto 5-0 away with an irresistible attacking display in their Champions League round-of-16 tie on Wednesday.Roberto Firmino completed the scoring in the first leg tie to hand the Portuguese league leaders their heaviest-ever home defeat in European competition and virtually guarantee Liverpool a quarter-final place.Salah's 29th-minute goal arguably upstaged Mane's treble as the Egyptian took his tally to 30 goals in all competitions this season.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsudYGTvHGlijBZJXYUUTkS8K8QG-IL5cAZ6ijUMO0HUPiKDP_1IUD1Ekcy7qF3Z5tWOqpqf7LMNroDLmC3S64JUsWuSVhTg5GmQwkY-AaCX9YAbCM4A880GwCoX3NquTnnCCapfuEsZPiwS6AUujBcq9oDvIZ23R6Se4xFuZBQSl002ZoC23kWawXC2mnZRcpAPgToPv3TRTnzGOb4et0iUBqXtK7iQ878iQZU-kxNLBjtZqcxKyMISs-_NWfvoC7mZzRPhOir8Cii-bvRp\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOGNvqm0fUF3EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
