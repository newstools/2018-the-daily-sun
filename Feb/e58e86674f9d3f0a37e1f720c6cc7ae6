SADIO Mane grabbed a hat-trick and Mohamed Salah scored with a mesmerising piece of ball-juggling as Liverpool demolished Porto 5-0 away with an irresistible attacking display in their Champions League round-of-16 tie on Wednesday.Roberto Firmino completed the scoring in the first leg tie to hand the Portuguese league leaders their heaviest-ever home defeat in European competition and virtually guarantee Liverpool a quarter-final place.Salah's 29th-minute goal arguably upstaged Mane's treble as the Egyptian took his tally to 30 goals in all competitions this season.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstYfDBD6b5iUpD1twHxb_m95uF9LFc1zJ73zKlITvTF-elu1UX-stK8m_qGdpctlgekmKDbAXhNBKITTyMsylLyO22FsoiFQkuBEARn-RnNEKkr2RRcOndzSeZdvi56QOemmjYoLURV6IhlzLwMUiACQbGLBb53uhOn-CsPT5OQ1kNlDXJK-_Faqp1o7XJ5qyW_m_3K31mvBao_YgF0cS7Md0uT-9U1rQt2uFzDCqi6_V844TFk3mddvBkfZl7xDClZ4jCMoIwf1qt508J5\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBGsCqEvH9XBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
