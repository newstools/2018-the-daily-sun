SADIO Mane grabbed a hat-trick and Mohamed Salah scored with a mesmerising piece of ball-juggling as Liverpool demolished Porto 5-0 away with an irresistible attacking display in their Champions League round-of-16 tie on Wednesday.Roberto Firmino completed the scoring in the first leg tie to hand the Portuguese league leaders their heaviest-ever home defeat in European competition and virtually guarantee Liverpool a quarter-final place.Salah's 29th-minute goal arguably upstaged Mane's treble as the Egyptian took his tally to 30 goals in all competitions this season.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuH4v14jjEV7MX0mpKpXqtk4bZrq0lFCQViJ3lkAXp_b26CKKMu0WrWHJoUl-0wGUe1mpjZLgObnYaMG7Qb-bLpQ9xEg-xmy2Lj7IwgF8B2M1uEjIn5gQSRbOK_bcLmoehXpKTGfNTIULO-UCwGyPmYnv3XvGntrwX5U769grvpqTWC20guxS98fTSGwvw7EnGKnX73swe4OEwv2vLbpULwCkiXKYE-cIkWQ9sUu9q8uZP80V3zpVKu9v9dmVGU9pfBPXnYRQ0HvRwUL6CX\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzONV_P3BfLfFEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
