The world is heading towards 70% urbanisation by 2050. This means that cities the world over are growing at a rapid rate. With more and more people moving from rural and semi-urban areas to work and live in cities, the day-to-day movement of people becomes problematical – traffic gets worse and commuters are spending more and more time in their cars. But, increasingly, there is a trend towards working remotely – and with technology advancing almost daily, mobility becomes easier and more viable for businesses and staff. Studies have shown that telecommuting increases efficiency. There are several reasons for this, including that employees get to retain more of the time in their day and don’t have to face the distractions of a traditional office, such as gossiping at the coffee or water machine. Most people who are in the workforce have access to a device that allows them to work remotely, whether access to e-mails or simply the ability to use messaging apps that are used for business conversation. Because of this, solutions to ensure security of information have become imperative – after all, no business wants their secret formula hovering around in cyberspace to anyone to snatch. This is especially relevant when it comes to staff using personal devices to create and store information specific to their work. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Craige Fleischer, Vice President of Integrated Mobility, Samsung South Africa, says, “There is a growing reliance on mobile devices for business – most employees can easily sync their personal mobile device to their work e-mails, for example. Samsung understands that mobility is increasingly imperative and has ensured that all devices are embedded with high-end data security, from Knox to Secure Folder, where important data can be kept safe.”Secure Folder creates a private, encrypted space on smartphones by leveraging the defence-grade Knox security platform. The Secure Folder allows users to keep your private files, images, and even apps in a separate secured folder. Content can be transferred in and out of the Secure Folder and a personalised lock type can be used for access. Cloud back-up and restore also greatly assists in managing information and files. “Multiple accounts can be created and this is where the magic happens – you can keep your work and personal data separate, so when using your smartphone to present ideas or reports, you won’t run the risk of opening a private album or displaying personal information,” concludes Fleischer. The future is remote and as urban centres become more populated, integrating great security and connectivity into mobile devices will become not only imperative, but the norm.
