Government will prioritise bringing down data costs as part of developing an economy in line with the fourth industrial revolution, says Minister of Economic Development Ebrahim Patel. Patel spoke on efforts made to develop the economy to be more inclusive during the debate in Parliament on Monday, following the State of the Nation Address.  One area of global development includes the digital revolution and South Africa should not fall behind in building an economy for the 20th century while competitors are focused on the economy of the future, he explained.  “Technology is changing economies and society in a deep and fundamental way,” Patel said. “The digital economy is a key driver of the fourth industrial revolution. Thus bringing down data costs is a priority for the year ahead,” said Patel. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu9GhLd2spd9W8T40Ej5-m7pWALrTVClhMybugBcAYGyI4xzf7vZItGf3vpe08AtUdhPjfFbGTBaIrKNyr8jtVGU7RTsv1emGyHttR5C-u4vLQw2dA800g0Q7Yt6Mg8V5IuCSfZvsmKUPk-WJmGbT8y3tIU0NKAOy58igLuqbkPkixfDzdLP1YvozOyOcKfJlZG4jg7N0Ep-rtTGPIQP9P-CQk78zM84Ogl7DQeMCUHCq8NYrdw6YhgQsHhZvMYPo-RBX4HzI8v0cHG0I0nSSt7SV2JD_o\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKpoGEVB4qLDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
