This is a golden opportunity to clinch the title with a game to spare – which has never happened before.Arrows have 29 points, four more than Bloemfontein Celtic in second.The KZN outfit could have won this title a fortnight ago but Ajax Cape Town denied them victory in the dying minutes, the teams playing to a 3-3 draw. Arrows captain Nkosinathi Sibisi is confident that they will head into the last match of the campaign against Bidvest Wits at the end of the month merely to honour the fixture. “There were lot of lessons in our last game against Ajax. We thought we had it until the last few minutes. We need all the points against Pirates and will need to concentrate from the first minute until the final whistle to avoid disappointment. Our plan is to wrap it up on Sunday.”Pirates and Arrows have met twice in the MDC. Arrows have the upper hand, having beaten them 2-0 last season after a 0-0 draw in 2015-16.Celtic can only win the title if Arrows lose to both Pirates and Wits, and Siwelele win their remaining games.
