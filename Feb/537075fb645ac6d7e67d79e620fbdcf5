IT’S derby time!KwaZulu-Natal takes centre stage this weekend when two of their football giants – AmaZulu and Golden Arrows – lock horns in an Absa Premiership match at the King Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi on Saturday (8.15pm). Unlike the Soweto derby, the KZN clash usually produces goals – as has been the case in the last five meetings, where there was a winner after each game.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstHaWFXQ_UGjtIkpH_FQqRkQdatab7DlEr_vxgFeU5vSaa5iS0KpLCp_GjaO7e1JwvHul89iKx5aIl5mzWl3_hzC2DkxCICO-1U7ay4loS9PdZSYjeoR68wNOZoFcHE_ZKcDD0HseQDRG-hvIBaZYEJvWgEMKcU7DG7LVZB30khVioyzIc-Vy5bvvunaeivxL2uHz7jplbIfQvyg-hlo-5KdQo-rc50n7BKbnCuZpAoSF3QoABck5O4d_wUf9D1xwgR85gBxuigjl06xVsMTR5SZA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAiydH8X0_B8EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

This means Usuthu will feel there is a score to settle. This adds spice to Saturday’s proceedings, as Usuthu will be out for revenge while Arrows will be looking to prove that their first round win was no fluke.Abafana Bes’thende assistant coach Mandla Ncikazi believes AmaZulu are now a different kettle of fish compared to last August when they leaked goals like a pot releasing steam.Said Ncikazi: “They now have a big, quality squad. We can’t take any chances. Our focus has to be at another level. We will need to be better prepared for this match.”Ncikazi says they know Usuthu have signed good players and will be careful of any backlash for last year’s humiliation. He says both teams are in need of three points, “and that by itself makes this tie very tough”.Added Ncikazi: “Derbies are not about who is on form. “Whether you play at home or away doesn’t matter in such matches. Right now both teams are among five in the relegation zone. Three points are a must for us. “We are still within reach of our target. At the moment we are chasing the 30-point mark and would like to get there as fast as we can. “We would then be able to avoid getting drawn into a relegation battle.”Like this story?
