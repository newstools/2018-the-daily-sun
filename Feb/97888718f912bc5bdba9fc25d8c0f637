My girlfriend also told them the same thing, but they didn’t listen to her,” he said.His girlfriend (18) said she had a fight with her mum after she slept at Thabo’s place. “My mother was angry with me and went to the police to open a case,” she told Daily Sun.“Cops took me to the police station. I told them my boyfriend didn’t rape me. I was shocked when they beat him up.”Thabo admitted to having a previous conviction. He was arrested in 2008 for an armed robbery. “I served nine years behind bars, and in jail I decided to study and got certificates in carpentry, sewing and upholstery,” he said. “Prison isn’t a good place for anyone. I would’t encourage anyone to find themselves on the wrong side of the law.”Lieutenant-Colonel Adele Myburgh said an assault case was opened against cops.
