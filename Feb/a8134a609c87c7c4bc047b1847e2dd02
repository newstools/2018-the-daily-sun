MZANSI’S female sprint legend Geraldine Pillay has blasted Athletics SA (ASA) and the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) for including only three women in Team SA’s track and field event.Olympics and World Championships superstar Caster Semenya, veteran javelin thrower Sunette Viljoen and 400m hurdler Wenda Nel, made the shortlist in the Commonwealth Games team scheduled for Gold Coast, Australia, from 4 to 15 April.On Tuesday, Sascoc president Gideon Sam announced 167 team members who will represent SA in 16 sporting codes.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssPhiFUQ0bKCOvX61Qhb9dF1ewHOgmh4YibwTBvvdr-PGfI-Puqv3DHKDUY3YyHALVaYnHKEvVOjL1ckDOk2WD_K5kb3f7LxH-xbSldeS15egDXaTCTQ-UQA69MIfMj53ZYlwt4T_R02zmSRE5CEwyDFluZtd1SjlDvbh0Zi17CKks_-dXDMpa2BKb0lBB-tT4ift8JIPGR2odvZd2Zq7t8iOeLLZyjyNJvMN6pApk53I1iUYTMs6pxnw-Q1InZD6O9XeSdTj7uka7Ieu2F\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMaAugvTg4Z4EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I’m very sad,” she said.No, we have enough women in athletics and to select just three of them is an insult to the sport.” Which criteria did they use because it’s very discouraging to other female athletes.” “The Commonwealth Games is a breeding ground for young athletes to gain experience at the highest level. Where are the other athletes that participated at the Olympic Games in Brazil and the World champs in London?” Pillay, who is now an athletics coach, said the three women in the 18-member athletics team were not a true reflection of the women representation.She said that 12 years ago in Australia the team had more women in the track and field, but now they appear to be going backwards. Pillay said: “I find it hard to digest this. It’s killing the sport and one begins to wonder if the number will go down for the 2020 Olympic in Japan.”She insists Semenya and Viljoen have overachieved and more room should be reserved for younger athletes.She concluded: “It is not worth it putting the big names at the expense of young ones in an event outside the Olympics and world champs.”Like this story?
