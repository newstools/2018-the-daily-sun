WHILE Ajay Gupta’s status in Mzansi is that of a fugitive, it’s believed he’s living the high life in India.  On Tuesday, Ajay was allegedly spotted on a flight to Puri, India, where he’s believed to be spending time after leaving Mzansi earlier this month. The Gupta brothers have denied being fugitives after cops said they were on the run. But they failed to appear in court on corruption charges related to the Estina Dairy Farm in the Free State.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuGOzr_Pins349_0YSOFzv_2rnxDVLt_s07uttSYusccpBv05Kdj6BpGgw9mWQFUxER7lgTdqqY8wgVqteFPUJqbMeDdt6dAruxyanQP6NVP3r65qIJUX32snL2Ij29RpxsvFkYDVc_gYQTPY3IsZ1tJmc3-_wE-zjZ3gWf-f_c3NpKBUie7gs5jzxuUN77hAQHdIemui8LMgj1ORBNr7pjkoqhxFe1QP14wZFTx18tP1rMznouH8_8NE-TY3rUBNqoU3brvs9s5cDlAuZ_RZyDgqJV8Tw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIL4kszf78FoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They are demanding that cops provide proof that an arrest warrant was issued.A source close to Ajay claimed he was enjoying life. “He is all smiles here. I don’t think he’s worried about whether he’s a wanted suspect in South Africa.Ajay is a proud Indian who has shown the whole world what Indian businessmen can do. He is the number one businessman in India,” claimed the source. Daily Sun can reveal that Ajay may still be in India, as can be seen in pictures recently posted on Facebook by businessman Pankaj Bhatt.Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said a warrant of arrest was issued, and the Guptas were still at large. He said it was not easy to arrest them while they were out of the country.“There’s a process that needs to be followed according to international law to have them arrested abroad.” Last month, the NPA placed the Guptas at the heart of a conspiracy to steal R220 million from the farm, which was meant to help emerging black farmers.
