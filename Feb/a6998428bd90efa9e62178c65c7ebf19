She said: “You know, as athletes we have goals and dreams, but this is one of the dreams I have had from a young age.“I grew up watching sports stars being nominated. I would wish to be there one day.”Caster has been nominated with the likes of Serena Williams, Katie Ledecky, Allyson Felix, Mikaela Shiffrin and Garbine Muguruza. She said the greatest moment of her career was taking part in the Rio Olympics in 2016. “Obviously the World Championships in 2009 too, because it was the first time I made it to the scene.” She said when she began her athletics career it was never about winning. Her next goal is to try a double again at the Commonwealth Games, and then also the African Champs and the World Cup.She said she was already looking forward to the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.“I’ll be 29 by then, so it will probably be my last Olympics in the 800m.”
