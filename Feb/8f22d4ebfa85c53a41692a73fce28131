On searching the man, the duo found the cell phone in his possession,” she said,Naidu said the officers had then arrested the man, as well as his accomplice, aged 39 and 40 years old, on charges of theft, bribery and assault on police.Cluster Commander for Mount Road Cluster, Major General Tembisile Patekile commended the members for a job well done.“Their instincts and actions are an example of professionalism in the SAPS,” said Patekile.Naidu said institutions and businesses were advised to monitor people that were idling about without seeking assistance.“Valuables must never be left on the table or in sight. If possible, always lock the door when exiting the office,” she said.SOURCE: News24
