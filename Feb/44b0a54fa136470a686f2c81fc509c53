PLATINUM Stars’ sale to a business consortium from Cape Town and Joburg has left the people of Rustenburg with many questions.The club getting sold to unknown businessmen has left a bitter taste in the mouths of Phokeng residents, who were left scratching their heads after their questions went unanswered by those on the podium yesterday.Roger de Sa, Dikwena’s current head coach, confirmed yesterday that he is one of the businesspeople who have bought the club for a meagre R22,5 million.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuOeOrEUmjp9xFE1fXY0d0-H2evLn8nUUOrRcZnWZcDW5MLKhC9ASqqXDVFFJSQfrLaRVdIUdWy455-c1e83-HFA404-HsEyzNAIDDVT3m2mRY-5Dt6kM1wpCxC8qzOHmTfmPJtTbUtwTSq7pXKuocqLMXOkU9sCYPW156noUvLjwFULegdG0iqmq24o_pv8IG1NuooSskUtexJ_womkXM9HidD2L--Bjbs3YCA4mIftfUDX7QRhFgpMjRUTl-oqCUEQTD83U_SxaaOOfZqUWNAwA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMuVbufudpk7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The prize tag has raised concerns among residents, who accused De Sa of deliberately driving the team down the PSL table so that him and his business cronies could acquire it cheaply.At yesterday’s press conference, held to clear up matters after an empty statement earlier, De Sa took questions along with Kgosana Joseph Rapetsana of the Royal Bafokeng Nation. Concerned people wanted to know: Why was the club sold for R22,5m instead of R32m, the amount offered by local businessman Thabo Mokgatlhe?Why was the consortium that includes De Sa, the preferred buyers, instead of Mokgatlhe, who made his offer first? Are there any guarantees that the club will stay in the North West forever, despite having owners from elsewhere?Rapetsane promised they would look into some of the concerns. Denying the unsubstantiated accusations made about him, De Sa said: “We didn’t have any advantages over anybody else when we bid for the team.“We made our bid like any other, were called and told our bid was successful. When I came here, the team was at the bottom and is still there. So how could I take Stars further down than 16th position?”De Sa said he was not bothered by fact that they would be working with some officials under investigation by the Hawks for fraud, money laundering and corruption.“We want to make a clean start,” he said. “All we ask is for the community to give us a chance and to stop criticising us. Our priority is football, nothing else. This is a beautiful part of the country, and the people are very friendly.” Rapetsana reiterated that they sold Dikwena because they could not afford to fund it anymore: “Our source of income comes from our investment in mining. We all know that the price of platinum has dropped. The money that was used to maintain Platinum Stars will now go to the community.” It remains a big poser whether the Absa Premiership team will remain in Rustenburg after this season.De Sa, who refused to reveal the names of the other three owners, admitted there are “hundreds of questions”.He said: “The team will remain here, everything will remain the same. We are not looking at making drastic changes. More important is the current position, moving away from the relegation zone. “Other decisions will be made after this season. We will continue to train at this, the best facilities, and use the best stadium. We will continue with the name, the club’s brand, colours and kit.”SunSport understands that the Rupert brothers from Stellenbosch are some of the shareholders with De Sa. It is also believed that Mokgatlhe, who accused club officials of having their fingers in the cookie jar, is trying to stop the new owners’ transaction in the courts.Meanwhile, Cliff Ramoroa was kicked out as club chairman yesterday.  Dikwena face Chippa United in their next league match at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm).
