WATER crisis or no water crisis, Lungile Gongqa has set his sights on defending his Old Mutual Two Oceans title this year. Although taps are running dry in Cape Town, organisers have assured runners that other measures to deal with the situation have been put in place. Organisers are also urging runners to bring their own dehydration packs, however, although elite runners are only focused on winning the gruelling 56km ultra-marathon. Gongqa has been working hard and says he has his sights set on claiming the highest spot on the podium again. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvc5Ane0uWdiKxSRTEq8CaMiLW9iqB44oBqHJt6uFooF1eCR8JxvdtkURgx7dmBbdO3MWyeSNk3npXYqz756sbCPhFwc8U3wuegkciwqUr2HP_Rwnin42cGPOTClPA6kwTJH8vrg629N3d-lrpoFX8glYRlrvflJff5jZGpS0E5-qSGHzl2Ent3myMAAc6QJjE-Lq7tyQKTXfkPjnkXTmpCxk9Vxhx2gXOhnEH7Z8e6Y2kOPYMq_6AglMDGZpz4qmbBSfIeMqi9lK4jwOE2\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzImxC0Ebck7ZEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Gongqa, who crossed the finish line in 3:09:38 to become the first man home in 2017, is hoping to register a better time this year. The Eastern Cape-born runner insists he is not the type to make frequent stops for a sip of water. Gongqa said: “I heard about the water crisis but it is the furthest thing from my mind right now. “I am currently in camp, training hard to defend my title. I believe I can achieve that objective – why not? “Furthermore, I don’t drink lots of water during races, so I’m not bothered by the water issues. I just want to focus on my training and aim for a good time.” A whopping R1 million will again be on offer in both the men’s and women’s race for anyone who breaks the long-standing records. This is in addition to the prize money for winning the race. The big bonus was first introduced in 2014 but remains untouched. Thompson Magawana’s record of 1988, a time of 3:03:44, is still standing, while Frith van der Merwe’s 1989 record of 3:30:36 also remains the time to beat. Gongqa says, however, that he is not obsessed with breaking any records, as that would make him lose sight of his goal of defending his title. He said: “I just want to win the race and retain my title. I’m not obsessed with breaking the record. I just want to run a near perfect race.” Gongqa, who used to train with veteran runner Hendrick Ramaala at Zoo Lake in Joburg, reckons he is in the best possible shape.
