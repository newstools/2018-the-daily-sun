took place, Mohammed said."The security forces are leaving no stone unturned
in their search for the girls," the minister said, after a meeting between
state and federal officials in Damaturu, another city in Yobe state.Police and civil defence officials are being deployed to
all the schools in Yobe, Mohammed added."We are back here in Yobe as part of efforts to
provide some succour to the parents of the girls, to let them know that they
are not alone and also to reassure them that we will not rest until we have
found the girls."Nigeria's air force will deploy reconnaissance planes and
soldiers to help in the search, President Muhammadu Buhari said.The incident has raised fears among parents of children
at the school in Dapchi, who said it reminded them of a mass abduction carried
out by Boko Haram fighters in April 2014.At the time, the armed group abducted 276 Nigerian
schoolgirls from the town of Chibok. More than one-third of those girls remain
unaccounted for to this day.More than 20 000 people have been killed and two million
others forced to flee their homes in northeastern Nigeria since Boko Haram
launched a campaign in 2009 aimed at forming a breakaway state.Over the years, the armed group has kidnapped thousands
of adults and children.Â https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/110-nigerian-schoolgirls-missing-attack-minister-180225171154082.html
