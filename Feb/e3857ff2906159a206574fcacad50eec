PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma is a known chess player.Since he was fired by Thabo Mbeki as deputy president of the country back then, he has been making one calculated move after another - although most of his moves were often outrageous and backfired.On Tuesday, he made another move which landed him in history books.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssCBMfWQ3bZE59I_z3nJu1eac_gs7Ulai5kFMxm36g2uectCJvnbniLQrt_pHN8igYoPRSbGtmLlR003jNigVTQ8gvvr-y7kziFPl9KVVnmNyuT56SNT8wSZRw8c0cVKtoLmmpcPNJWSzLZQZeG8wiu2yll-AKm9hlTtPAl9q1c-h6YZIxFVcJxZ06j_hXbJuxgdKXAuBQT2YlksUwt6pDtyrfSG7UFYnuUSESp8CYuBZxku3_Sus3QoRJ-sQ_GxLga37U8xHAf2EnDJevAENuq_pscSRs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMn7jPWW1LjbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>He has become the first ever democratically elected South African president to postpone the State of the Nation Address (SONA). And this happened not because he was sick, but due to the fact that more and more people are less interested in having him deliver the address.As a result, South Africa is at standstill. And will remain so until the stumbling block at Mahlamba Ndlopfu is removed.Make no mistake, SONA is an important occasion in the country because it outlines government's plans for the whole year.It is from SONA that we find the direction in which the country is going.But on Tuesday, we were robbed of this opportunity just because of one man - the stumbling block that is Jacob Zuma.Zuma has been a denialist during the most part of his presidency.He is known for denying the obvious but on Tuesday, he could not deny the fact that his SONA speech will not be successful. Being a chess player that he is, maybe he sensed that delivering SONA was going to be a dangerous move.He couldn't ignore or deny the mounting pressure from the society at large, including within his own party, for him to leave us in peace.All the nation want to hear from Zuma is "Compatriots, I have decided to resign as president of South Africa with immediate effect."Now because of this wait, country duty require us to always be glued to our phones and TV screens and radios as we hope to hear a 'groundbreaking' announcement by Zuma.But as they say great chess players make timely moves. They take occasional extra time for other things or to think when the position is complex. Lately, Jacob Zuma has gone to ground. He is not even communicating government programmes or cutting ribbons. No one knows what he is thinking, but one thing is for sure: he is planning his next move.We only hear that he has had "fruitful, constructive, robust and engaging discussions"  with Ramaphosa and the ANC top 6. Whatever this means,  with bated breaths we shall wait, until we hear our country's fate. It's no longer about Zuma and the ANC but about the direction of our country.We hear rumours that he is planning to resign while others say he is planning to fire Ramaphosa and replace him with Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Whatever the case, we hope to hear from Zuma sooner than later - even if it's at midnight.
