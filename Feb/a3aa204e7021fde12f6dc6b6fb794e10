Some babies are found alive, some are found dead. “I think the girls who do this are afraid of their parents. Their parents send them to school but when they get here, they focus on other things.”Last year, Daily Sun published stories of newborn babies found on Ibika campus and also on the Mthatha campus.Police spokesman Captain Jackson Manatha said the foetus was taken to the government mortuary in Butterworth.“No one has been arrested,” he said.
