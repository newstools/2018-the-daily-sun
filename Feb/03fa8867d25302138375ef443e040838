The group allegedly evicted some residents and sold their bed spaces for between R900 and R1 500.”Chiliza said the trouble started when another group, known as the Hlophes, opposed the Mthembus.“The groups would hold marches on the same day. In 2010, they started stabbing people. “From 2010 to early 2014, there was a total of 24 murders. Later that year, the killings escalated dramatically.” Close to 100 people have been killed at Glebelands Hostel over the years. The death toll stood at 93 in August when a 38-year-old man was gunned down at the hostel.
