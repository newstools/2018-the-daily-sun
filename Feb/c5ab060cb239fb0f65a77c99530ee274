Any normal person makes Faith Muthambi a minister and leave out a person like Thoko Didiza?"You removed people at Eskom following allegations. You didn't waste time. You waste time to remove your own colleagues here."He said all those who are going to be frequenting the state capture inquiry, must be dismissed so they can have time to prepare for the inquiry.Malema told Ramaphosa not to protect those who continue to be implicated in corruption."That's why the EFF chanted 'Aaaaaaaace' when he was speaking. "You wanted to save Ace's face by jumping that line. Why? You want to continue to protect your own," he said.
