I think he will not score a few, he will score many goals for us. “He has the ability to do that. All we have to do is to get back to playing our brand of football.” But the former Bafana Bafana midfielder was somewhat worried about the new darling of United after he had to replace the player in the 77th minute against Celtic due to injury.“We hope his injury is not that serious,” said a concerned coach. “We already have lots of injuries to regular players in the team.” This is true – Tinkler certainly cannot afford to have another player out due to injury at this time, as he already have the likes of No 1 goalie Ronwen Williams, Tefu Mashamaite and Bradley Grobbler out of action.Williams is expected back in two weeks, while Grobler and Mashamaite could be out for the rest of the season.Tinkler’s charges are back in action on Sunday when they meet Bloemfontein Celtic again, this time for a Nedbank Cup Last 32 match at the Dr Molemela Stadium.
