Hip Hop star, Jabulani Tsambo, better known as HHP has revealed how he was often teased as a child because of his weight.The rapper told Metro FM’s DJ Fresh on the Fresh Breakfast this week how children would give him a hard time growing up, but there were also times where his weight would come in handy."Growing up as a chubby kid was always weird. But there was this one time that I really appreciated it. Me and my friends were walking down the road and this dog started chasing us. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvRBD1eczaeRjhqKxtZHSH0RvSzEBNMuG8pt1XDTc3VZJjqA0eKNl-NgkH5q0vleoBk6BadO6Ba5iHEe0lf9oLHdATnd_WzK8ZCjIRHcnJg5qE8LHibQGHEXJUNgAROjCxcafJTX3qglZXXfLqd3XJ3ltleaki-XdSXBQBO3WboeLZ7QPtyuMIDFI4Gn_bBhUaTDO3TM4jqF9EwCVrBDT4suge_2FXhK53vcqWRWVTIfiHiZQC6o5dVXZJVNg_UTi4HJOZxDkmYxCa6qU294Bihkmf5nO-wdEAOlg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAkJv2bW6HOEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Already I am crying. I was slowing down and getting ready to die. Other dogs started joining in the chase. "Suddenly something miraculous happened. The dogs whizzed past me.They were looking for the fastest. I realized then that being fat had its perks," he said.His weight also led him to playing rugby; the rapper remembered with pleasure how he would often try to run during games but without the pace he would have liked to have."One time I had the ball and I was so sure I was going to score the try. In my mind I am cruising but the guy who tackled me just walked up to me. I was like; 'How does this happen?"“Jabba” as he is also known, has often been a victim of body shaming on social media. He often just laughed it off or shared jokes about his weight.However, he once told a fan that he felt he was an easy punching bag and an easy victim for cyber abuse because of his weight and fame."Don't you know?! Jabba is not only weak...he's slow and fat. Easy to hit. Hard to miss. I'm the perfect punch bag,” he told Fresh.
