AMAZULU captain Mbongeni Gumede feels there is nothing much the coach Cavin Johnson needs to fix ahead of their meeting against Durban neighbors Golden Arrows on Saturday night at Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium (8.15pm).In their last four matches Usuthu have collected eight points out of a possible 12, and they also kept four clean sheets in the process. Gumede feels their performance in those matches will go a long way in helping them amass maximum points against Abafana Bes’sthende. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssIdEtcmNN1qX1T50Zx6Rguvse5-228AntUnvIfKkhJkJio2SvTJv-XwsTrFG5aKzvtGh01jL4ZMVv-QHaHdTViF8yeICKRkOYmPioK4emmR7I2LmJDxXXxrnvjzKuhEB7z86_CUclknLDbGrL9jPsCJQut2c0tzK_eJ4-PvrPC89brPT5fX49S6tzDzMJNifN9aRyxpzYJBcrpZAIhCLaneP8TltRPrxUiDeT5viU8NHO3DBZJVphGOg_VgZkqu7D6e4YgGMXj9wMYknws6PTV_A\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAW3nH5SU7n0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I don’t think there is a need to change the way we have been playing, plus the personnel that started the last matches. It has worked wonders for us so far, and on top of that we have managed to keep clean sheets.”When Usuthu met their archrival in September they were humiliated by Arrows beating them 4-1.That defeat is still fresh on players’ minds.Gumede, however, said there hasn’t been talk of revenge. He said all they know they are in it for a tough match that they will need to give it their all to make sure they secure maximum points.“Matches are not the same and the approach will always be different in each and every game. We know what transpired in our last match against them. But we are not going to Saturday’s match with the mentality of revenge. That would be suicidal on our part. Same goes for Arrows. I don’t think they will come at us thinking they will beat us as easily as they did.” The 24-year-old skipper added that the three points they came with from Matsatsantsa a Pitori has given them a breather ahead of Arrows clash. With that win Usuthu moved away from the relegation zone to 11th place and they are now tied with 23 points with Abafana Bes’thende who are in position 10 due to superior goal difference.  He said:”For us, every match is crucial. The club management and supporters are expecting more from us and we need to deliver. "They know we are capable of delivering good results and that is what we told ourselves that we will do in these last matches of the season. We would need to continue collecting those points on Saturday, no excuse.”  Like this story?
