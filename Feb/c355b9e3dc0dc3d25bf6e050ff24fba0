She said cops later found the son’s bloodied clothes in the house and bust him for murder. The dead woman’s husband got a call at work to come home. “When I got home I was told my stepson was responsible,” he said.“We were always being called to intervene when he had stolen from people. “He was expelled from school for stealing his classmate’s cellphone.” Ga-Rankuwa police spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi said a case of murder was opened.“The suspect will appear in the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrates Court soon.
