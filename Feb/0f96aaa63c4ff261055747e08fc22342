Acting South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) CEO
Pearl Bhengu has revealed the Constitutional Court will on March 6 rule on the
agency's request to extend the Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) contract by six
months.Bhengu and new Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu
appeared in Parliament on Wednesday to update MPs on Sassa and the department's
state of readiness to migrate the nation's social grants scheme from CPS by
April 1.Sassa has 31 days in which to fully migrate core components
of the grants scheme from CPS, as ordered by the Constitutional Court, to the
South African Post Office (SAPO), as agreed in December last year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst80hfRi42O6hymTBcuYCOC6p1Hmzo9ikS6vOhoXnq3PxAkEphHS2F3f7_977n9kkOUrssF36eSPGWF8aR9X-VM8ecGSMvZozOxG1WK551dXdd2D8GRLXEU9Zld2MRL5C7jScokGk0_VcvVv7QsycrTF9O_3gsLIEgMiBNNBiCrXHj1lp01Du4Xpxj6lTwazyMrCYogDcgnVGSaR34bPvjqB2TcYrpDb5fDWIhPQnrYbTNXBvtQRBJksBMhcbgZG7-CiO2d1KeS45fq8PSW-10b_qcokvc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzF2GWsDv0BKnEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

important developments since last week, after Sassa requested an extension of
the CPS contract earlier this month."The date has been set for March 6, of which the court
will be sitting for that. We are waiting to hear if the court will grant us
that six-month phase-in, phase-out of CPS. The court will say yes or no."Bhengu assured MPs that all payments starting from April
will come from Sassa's corporate account, not CPS'. This includes payments to
the 5.7 million people who had Grindrod Bank cards."On April 1, everyone will be paid, whether CPS is here
or not. The only problem may be at the [cash] pay points."Cash payments at riskSassa's key concern is for the 29% of grant beneficiaries,
most of whom live in rural areas and depend on cash deliveries of their social
grants, a service that is currently provided by CPS.In case the court says no to the six-month extension, there
is a contingency plan in place, she continued.Bhengu said beneficiaries who use cash pay points, roughly
2.9 million people according to the inter-ministerial committee, had already
been categorised."We are busy with that process so we can make sure
those people get that money. We will have to give them pin numbers, and we do
have some merchants that have biometric [security features]."On paydays, we will calculate how many people are
there, and take them to a place where they can get their money at the nearest
ATM, merchant or store."This is all in the event that the Constitutional Court does
not allow an extension of the invalid CPS contract.'Head still spinning'MPs across the political spectrum registered their unease at
CPS overstaying its welcome."Whenever CPS gets mentioned, I get so sceptical. The
attitude we saw last year, I get very uncomfortable," said ANC MP
Sibongile Tsoleli."If we have to be with them for six more months [so be
it], but after [that] we must bury them."SAPO chief operating officer Lindiwe Kwele told Parliament
two weeks ago that, whatever the court's decision, in principle, SAPO would
still be in charge of the scheme come April 1.The "phase-in, phase-out" period was merely to
ensure smooth transition, she said.SOURCE: NEWS24
