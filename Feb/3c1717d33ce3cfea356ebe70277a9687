The suspect allegedly dragged her to an open space near the train station in Tembisa and raped her.  The victim said the suspect hid his face, but when he removed his cap she realised it was the same man who had attacked her previously. “Cops had been looking for the suspect when the woman came to the station to say the same man had raped her again,” said Ralidzivha. “She told cops she was followed by the suspect while walking from the mall.  “She tried to change direction, but the man followed and attacked her.” Ralidzivha said anyone who has information about the suspect should contact Detective-Sergeant Tebogo Sesing on 071 201 9576.
