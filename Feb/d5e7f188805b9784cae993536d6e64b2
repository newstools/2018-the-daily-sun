THE season may very well be over for suspended Baroka FC head coach Kgoloko Thobejane.Even though club chief executive Morgan Mammila has not come out and said it, indications are that Thobejane will not be anywhere near Baroka’s technical bench anytime soon.Mammila has, however, insisted that he is not fired. Thobejane was suspended by the club on allegations of consuming firewater while on duty in the team bus on their way back to Polokwane from Bethlehem.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstWYYv8Q-cCFQCwTunJ2xpWxlCPEKdMsl7kpCKVAC-d0HIJUrQUdwWPwWfPI6csvv83fUEQoP9kkgthCPpIF4uE1lVPwTqwK_TCRlJP94qXyc9_LimoWWwz_--Tus2H4BjVGKuYpbFaq5esfCZes3K-hfCkl7LsnEl-vSbFF9zbo-zKM5h4NgUQQhF-wUxkA6cggRqIUBQ5HXrFYJUkUtohCVEqaunZLsWSy1XMcbH20KoYXZaUonmmkQjA5B_wlv-AxhWV5WZDmEX6pirwxL4J8Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJau44V4HAj9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We were playing on Saturday, we have another match against Cape Town City tonight and on Friday we play Bidvest Wits away. “We postponed the hearing, we do not have time for it at the moment. We have not set a new date but coach Kgoloko is still part of the club.”Thobejane was suspended with three senior players, Oscarine Masuluke, captain Olaleng Shaku and Sipho Moeti, who were prevented from training with the senior team. The trio have not featured in the lineup since the day of the incident. Stated Mammila: “MacDonald Makhubedu will continue leading the team. “The players in question are available for team selection but Makhubedu’s selection is based on players who are performing.”Baroka and the Citizens have met on five prior occasions, both in the league and cup, which produced 15 goals overall.Bakgaga have not won a league game in their last four outings, while the Citizens will be determined to claim maximum points after losing three league games in a row – 1-0 to both Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns and 2-1 to Bidvest Wits.Like this story?
