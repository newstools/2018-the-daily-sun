Speaking from her mourning mattress at her dead boyfriend’s house in Illovo, she said: “All his siblings and parents died a long time ago. “The extended family members never liked him. “He had said he wanted to be buried near where he lived.” She said he had made her the beneficiary of his policies and assets.“The Manqeles should be co-operating instead of coming here to make threats. Fighting me won’t solve anything.” Nkosinathi’s cousin Sbusiso confirmed his family wanted to take the matter to court but didn’t want to comment further.Cultural expert Jabulani Maphalala said Bongiwe was wrong for claiming the corpse of a man she wasn’t married to.“His body still belongs to his family since he’s still seen as a child,” he said. “But the law will definitely favour her. She lived with him for many years.”
