Wits host Mauritius outfit Pamplemousses in the preliminary round of Champions League on Saturday, while City take a shot trip to Swaziland where they will face Young Buffaloes in the preliminary round of Confederation Cup on Friday.City made their presence felt early on and Rusike’s goal in rainy conditions jolted Wits into the match as they piled pressure on the visitors in a bid to grab the equaliser. The Clever Boys seem to have left their scoring boots at home with Kaizer Chiefs bound winger Vincent Pule being the main culprit as he fluffed two clear-cut chances.The two teams suffered a huge blow in the second half when Wits defender Sifiso Hlanti and Craig Martin of Citizens sustained head injuries after they collided which ended their night on the pitch.
