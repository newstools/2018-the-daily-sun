So you’ve just finished high school and are now embarking on a new journey – the life of a university student. It is said that the most important years of your life are between the ages of 18-24, because they are the years that shape you to who you are going to be in your life. Your life as a university student is exciting and adventurous, however there are many unknown things that I’d wish someone told me before heading to university. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Here are five things you need to know about your new life in university. 1.	Hectic workload When you’re in university, you have lectures and classes to attend, weekly homework (readings, quizzes), assignments to complete and exams to study. The challenging thing is that it is up to you to manage your time on how you will complete all your work and attend all your classes. There is nobody checking up on you to make sure your work is done besides yourself.  You need to be disciplined and be committed to why you are in university. If you find yourself falling behind on your school work, consult with the university tutors and lectures so they can help you manage your time effectively. Make sure you do as much work as you can each day so you don’t get overwhelmed. 2. Peer Pressure It’s no secret that peer pressure is real, and in university you will come across it. It’s very important that you have a strong sense of self and know who you are.  Don’t give in to peer pressure or the pressure of being cool or being “an adult”. Don’t do anything that feels uncomfortable or just to please other people, just be yourself. 3. Losing friends Don’t be alarmed when you find yourself drawing back from people who are in your life. In life we out grow people and that’s okay, you may find that you no longer connect with the friends you have and that’s okay too. This is because you’re growing and you’re finding yourself – sometimes the person you’re growing into doesn’t hang out with the people you hang out with now because you’re not the same person as you were when you were in high school. 4. Finding yourself Take time to find yourself. This means, sit by yourself and have quite times to listen to yourself. Take time to listen and envision what you want out of school, your career, your life, your happiness, everything. This will help you develop a sense of self and truly know who you are. Once you know, accept it, surrender to it, have peace with it and follow it. 5. The relationships you make are for life The relationships you make and develop during this time are for life. Take the time to make strong and meaningful connections with people. The power of association is important. Make real friends who support, love, and care for you. Have lifetime friendships and who knows you probably will meet your future spouse in university.
