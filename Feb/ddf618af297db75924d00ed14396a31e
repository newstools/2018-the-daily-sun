FORMER president Jacob Zuma is out, some of the Guptas are facing charges and the country is happy. But John Maseko (49) from Lakeside near Evaton, Vaal is happier than everyone else. And to express his joy, he even wrote a poem!if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstiFu-E__CPwUDYkGBHcyOBj1EJRWJjRj1yFJ2qNZnFecfU-e6kqtadAiHSOok76gN6rjp-LQK0VO2NGyfyfdV3XS6Q3o6yX_6NkD2BN12dTpnELqbQKjEsnoj8eJeIOPKl8m-t7v4M34NZUTvoqOqKQR0E3lMIg7Fd3aRAQ2OOc3l30b0EdS8BNOqC58TdQurAky9Pe_o4JaIKv6IWe7XdXjiETPPyn2gB-M9d3BVdDHVpb2e1r4e7RDDKPwy2EEQH32DU0t8I8McmBdNUF2xmTSUk6FM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFz_xd1HLMCeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I watched how they ignored the residents’ cries and focused only on enriching themselves,” said John. “They never took their jobs seriously, and they never cared about the people.” He said corruption in the country was a chain that went from the top right to the bottom.“I would watch Zuma and his ministers visit the Gupta home and I would see that no good would come from those meetings they held,” said John.In his poem, John writes: “The world is turning around, when lies become true. “And today becomes tomorrow because almost every person wastes most part of their lives in an attempt to display qualities they don’t posses. And to gain applause which they cannot keep. “Quit lying. Yekelani amanga!” John said he knew that the day would come when Zuma would be forced to resign. “Zuma should have stopped being selfish when he was first exposed, but he was stubborn. “Now he has become an enemy to almost the whole country and his image has been tarnished,” said John.
