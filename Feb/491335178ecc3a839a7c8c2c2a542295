THE City of Cape Town has warned residents not to stockpile water.Xanthea Limberg, the mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services, said such practices could bring Day Zero closer, which is when the city’s taps run dry.“Stockpiling municipal water, whether at home or at work, will prevent us from stretching our water supplies into the winter months and beyond,” said Limberg. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvOz2gevKSIlEgcMxDvruh2t78fSI0YCcucjbXgyxJ7DsUpJ9hLhcWh5Y3qVckSUKdZtjNoTTqadEwzKGdZmodmIdOKp0o0KT2vPHJ83jg2AhEjz9q7UlcbD8sqVh1Zx3upWbAUtBH6vxdpJU_1_SMVjpb9WJaQMJY2dIxdSBowm57smN0ui3CsqDsYiPjQ4e7u3F5iq6uQ3s-v5f3Dn8RBFL8AjYEVqp1GQ37j-QpS7_aR3y3hWYLT-uvqsJcnYuBGKMqrw9TIx3646Vw0dmEzEU9haeY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLDqnE__nsl7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The original date was 19 April. Deputy mayor Ian Neilson said: “We now need to see how low we can go to ensure that we stretch our water supplies as far as possible into winter.“We aim to reach the 450 million litre per day collective consumption target, which equates to 50 litres per person per day.”The latest data indicated that dam storage level is at 24,9% – a weekly decrease of -0,6%. “If you are using or stockpiling municipal water above your allocation, it is an illegal act and doing so will bring Day Zero closer again.”
