It is not common that you find a 7 month old with an Instagram account.People on social media were left surprised when they learned that Ntando Duma's 7 month old daughter had an Insta account, what left them even more surprised was the fact that she had more followers than most of them.TV and radio personality Ntando, was quick to explain in a recent interview with Metro FM, that baby Sbahle’s Insta profile is actually for business reasons than anything else.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>“The reason I actually opened an Instagram account for her is for business stuff. She gets paid every month,” she explained.Ntando further explained that baby Sbahle is an ambassador for a nappy brand called Cute Kiddies.“What she does is post stuff for the brand and gets paid for it. My sister (Thando Duma) and I are the ones who do the posting,” she said.In case you were wondering what Ntando does with the money generated by little Sbahle, she was just as quick to clear that up as well.“The money is in her account. She’s going to start using it when she goes to school.” she said.While many people may find it difficult to accept that a 7 month old has more Instagram followers than them, they will have to come to terms with the possibility that she probably also has more money. I give up on this one @sbahlemzizi ????????I'm actually taking you to your first lecture tomorrow morning at Wits?????? #AngishoUkuthiMeetaniA post shared by  Ms Ntando Fleekiswa Duma (@dumantando) on Feb 11, 2018 at 9:03am PST
