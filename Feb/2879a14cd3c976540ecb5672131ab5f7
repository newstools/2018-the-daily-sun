WHEN nature calls, pupils at Malatse Secondary School have no choice but to go to the bush to relieve themselves. This is because the toilets at the school in Lefiso, near Marapyane in Mpumalanga, are in an awful condition. Pupils told Daily Sun they were scared to use the toilets because there was no privacy and the walls were unstable. Parents said they were still waiting for the school to address the matter. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu8kcn68RBru5KdwPKQXyhjfBKRMuqDErSqldF3SBx4CKyfkK8CqxcoNGk062gqaJKfcpMm3_bkHTh65uaq6shoD5DEeQYBMCJRc7n7yZTWSUq39lX3ioEH7Y79wA1y6iuKyMyJ8x5Juu8ttql2SAZJHZqMBDaCD6butClcp_uALAbQSY6vU9xrLOqMzeaAXeFvsKSlow49JwKMLIrEDveAAHAJYuJ0Nj086_F6MqqvGYSqIdcfSJh7z_oMksGZ3PpFRNR0y5aimtWUaS_sDnYhaiH84-Y\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIlebWJKkT6iEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Parent Joyce Maleka said she heard about the state of the toilets from her child. “Our children are at risk but the school is doing nothing to address the challenge.” she said. Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said they were aware of the situation. He said plans were in place to replace them with new ones. “A team of officials from the department will meet the SGB soon to update them on how the process will unfold.”
