We must not defend too deep because we could end up scoring own goals.“I am comfortable with the lead, we just have to work on coming up with a different plan in the second half. We are one step away, we will need to keep our consistency.”Bantwana will play the second leg without Karabo Dlamini, who scored a brace on Sunday before being sent off.Like this story?
