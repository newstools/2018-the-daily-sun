The Nedbank Cup has to be secondary.” Tinkler will rest most of his senior players for this showdown with Phunya Sele Sele, who lost 4-2 to Matsa­tsantsa in a league clash at Lucas Moripe Stadium last week.The Bafana Bafana legend says his players are tired, having played nine league catch-up matches in 27 days.This will be a huge boost for struggling Celtic head coach Veselin Jelusic, as that means Matsatsantsa could be without star players such as Aubrey Modiba, Teboho Mokoena, Clayton Daniels, Dean Furman, Reneilwe Letsholonyane, Thuso Phala and Kingston Nkhatha.Tinkler emphasised that resting his big guns did not mean he was taking the cup tournament lightly. “We are planning to give most of the senior players a break after they played so many games in few days,” he said. Youngsters likely to be given a chance include Denwin Farmer (21), Prince Dube (21), Sipho Mbule (19), Jamie Webber (20), Darren Smith (22) and Dylan Stoffels (19), along with the likes of experienced Onismor Bhasera, who has been struggling for game-time this season.United’s new lethal striker Evans Rusike, who scored a debut goal for United during their Celtic win, will also likely get a run.
