FUMANE High School has serious problems. Since heavy rain damaged three classrooms at the school in Klipgat, North West last month, students are being taught under trees and in the parking lot. When the SunTeam visited the school on Wednesday, zinc sheets from the roof were strewn all over the school grounds. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu834uV1F5HI-uTo1Vl9OmkCJRAETZttMEoSfjK5Cg4HkQIrWgamZEzO8C_WXk2MErLbvs0GGpXwxrBx7d8aVyvDBipx3GhPm9oYrK17w2Kq_nWyMUhbHmllwXxwPu3uGk0meHhbvFktQcC71GVcw3UvXo2jqj55oMoiK8qNsgtycnpE38iIOqu4CcYWrnTZeqwd_rC7T4zFpgG5tWn4kyXaRnHXZl-Qn952O5hnKlgmLU60_zlNAex2PnXCu64NA8EZb1EwBnqfiQBz6TtZU9zPkAJyiI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHClzzI36nzjEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The North West Department of Education has promised that the school will be fixed soon but staff and pupils are worried because so far, nothing has been done.SGB chairman Lawrence Molamolamo said the damage was reported to the department soon after it happened. “We hoped when schools re-opened the problem would be fixed but nothing has been done,” he said. A teacher said teaching could not be put on hold but it was difficult as classes were too big and teachers had to speak at the top of their voices. North West Education spokeswoman Bayanda Zenzile said they were aware of the situation. “The department sent an inspector to do a full assessment. The circuit manager will meet the school principal to come up with an alternative for pupils being taught under the trees.”
