SOUTH Africa’s Under-17 national women’s team coach Simphiwe Dludlu says it will be war tomorrow when they meet Morocco in the final round of the 2018 Fifa Women’s World Cup qualifiers. Bantwana left for Morocco on Monday to finish off what they started in Dobsonville two weeks ago when they thumped the Lions of the Atlas 5-1. The match will be played at the Stade Boubker Aamar in Sale, Morocco, tomorrow (4.30pm SA time). if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvwf02zbiMf0dhyFft_fwcy9asmz0Ut6CEjGWcloJCEdniFP5dZugCCU3aGHnsHQ6kP0KycIoiWp05clT0qEYOiXMc_BZHKiY63Kgmvn0oByZRBHt_fQDLFNGBtmbZZxKTwdkL4_cq4Gqtblbz48Zfqq-qu_MZxXKbT9l7mcCYsetULipx2ePTL-D6yqssY1JD2vhRGTDc1w6qqbHpwhYV8XIDf5gICJ9wcm0AwcyDlfUnR68K126gRVZNTUhVsy0eF49zPuR-qedvZKgFD\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHka-C0qwXLTEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

You can’t really compete with the heart! \“We are away from home and the odds are against us. We are preparing the girls for war. It is always war for us when it comes to this type of games.”If they do qualify, it will be Bantwana’s second Women’s World Cup. Their first World Cup qualification was back in 2010 for the Trinidad and Tobago event.
