KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a murder case and an inquest docket were opened. The man will also face a charge of negligence. “It’s believed the 11-year-old was playing with his father’s licensed firearm at 11.50pm on Saturday, when a shot went off and his two-year-old sister was hit.” “The victim was taken to hospital, but she later died. It’s believed the brother turned the gun on himself after seeing what had happened to his sister.” Mbele urged all owners of firearms to make sure they keep their guns in a safe place, because failing to do so is against the law.She said when people ignore the Firearms Control Act, it leads to many unnecessary deaths. The SunTeam tried to call the children’s mum but her phone went straight to voicemail.
