MANY football fans may assume Mamelodi Sundowns will be chasing revenge against Cape Town City tonight.After all, the Brazilians are winless against the Cape side in three successive league matches.But nothing could be further from the truth, as Pitso Mosimane will be eyeing redemption rather than revenge when Sundowns face the Citizens at Athlone Stadium (8pm).if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuHNR7h1wVIo1dSv9lJH5k8NOG5dXAEqtLt7xVt56MxswPrkkyFS9fH8C2aYlgoNaAErD6fKoGdtfFYWww35DCgeYcZQ5uOYY-TqdLhnOspbLra-lqBg8CZ4Ql8l4zqC0BHTSgcGO3VwNUsQEtF8LelfFCgg9lN-FAcDiBQ-LRb0QH6kbRqLlEU_nB_l4Re-7jRQ-GNXPnmsC5M2ZUAr8wrIfAaOLn6WYrXzzSfk6nto3tvt0zBGF9xhq8MJ1jnt6MY7ESg4irdpxpxDJS1mSzvbQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFs8Qyd20jPVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They are behind us in the league table and more than anything, they’re looking to close the gap. If we don’t win, we keep the distance the same. As I’ve said, they always play well against us.”A five-point gap separates the two sides at the top, which could easily have been narrowed had the Citizens won their last match against Bloemfontein Celtic, seeing that Sundowns dropped two points at Kaizer Chiefs.But the unpredictability of the current Absa Premiership campaign is such that no team can be ruled out for victory.Who would have predicted that Ajax Cape Town would beat Orlando Pirates in the midweek fixture?City are certainly nothing like their Ikapa rivals but they’ll draw confidence from their surprising 3-0 win, and eager to also claim a scalp or two.With head coach Benni McCarthy serving his suspension, the Citizens will rely on assistant coach Vasilis Manousakis for guidance.But the cameras will often be pointed towards the stands, fixed on McCarthy, who is never shy to express his feelings.New signing Matthew Rusike could make his debut for City, but there could be opportunities for fellow recruits Masoud Juma and Ugandan winger Allan Kateregga too. Aubrey Ngoma could face his former side after switching to the Brazilians last month.Pressure will also be on Jeremy Brockie, the high profile January signing, to break his Sundowns duck.Like this story?
