SUVs are all the rage right now. All self-respecting manufacturers
have SUVs in their stable or they have plans to build one. New entrants include
Lamborghini, Rolls-Royce and even Ferrari is planning to build an SUV.BMW is one of the pioneers in the field. The
X5 was a game changer when it was first introduced in 1995. Since then, the BMW
X-range has grown substantially. It now ranges from the X1 all the way up to
the upcoming X7.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The X4 is supposed to be the X3’s sportier and
sexier sister. The new X4 is all-new which is odd for BMW. The current X4 is
only 4 years old, a bit young for BMW to be replacing it. For example, the
current X5 has been around since 2012. The reason why BMW is replacing the F26
X4 so early is a bit complicated. See the current X4, the F26 was based on the
F25 X3, a car that had been around since 2010. Which means the four-year-old
F26 is actually 10 years old.The new car is also based on the current X3,
which is not a bad thing. The current X3 has been getting rave reviews from
journalist all over. The new X4 gets styling cues from its more conventional
brother.It adopts the X3's pig face. The big grille dominates the front end.
The headlights have divorced the grille just like on the new X3. The headlights
are LEDs as standard with the striking Adaptive Headlights as optional extras.  

The new car is 37 millimetres wider than the
outgoing model, adding to the car's dynamic profile. The old car always looked
slim and tall and it didn't really look anymore dynamic than the X3. The side
profile is much sleeker than the outgoing model which always looked odd. This
is helped by the fact that the new car is 81 millimetres longer and 3
millimetres shorter than the outgoing car.The rear-end is where I'm sure most negative comments will be coming
from. I'm also conflicted as to whether I like it or not. My opinion on the
design changes depending on the angle I’m looking at it. Maybe seeing it in the
flesh will convince me of the design. It reminds me a lot of the GLC Coupe,
another car whose rear end I'm not really feeling.You'd be hardpressed trying to differentiate
the new X4 from the current X3 from the inside. The interior is almost the
same. Again this is not a bad thing. The G02's interior is one of the best, if
not the best interior in the Premium mid-size SUV range.The X4 will be offered with a whole range of engines including the
raucous 3-litre six-cylinder petrol in the X4 M40i. The M40i engine puts out
265kW and 500Nm of torque The 0-100km/h dash is dealt with in 4.8 seconds and
the top speed is limited to 250km/h in the M40i. The smooth eight-speed
Steptronic transmission comes standard. The M Performance models comprising of
the BMW X4 xDrive30i, BMW X4 xDrive30d and BMW X4 xDrive25d come with the
eight-speed Steptronic Sports transmission which offers quicker gear changes and
launch control. xDrive is standard across the range. There’s also a new X4 M40d
which features an in-line six-cylinder diesel pushing 240kW and a whopping
680Nm of torque. The M40d will hit 100km/h in 4.9 seconds and go on to a
limited top speed of 250km/h.  

BMW says that this new X4 is more dynamic to drive than the previous generation
and even the current X3. This is thanks to the 50kg weight loss which has
resulted has a lower centre of gravity. The X4 will be hit our shores in the third quarter of the year.
