JUDGE Robert Henney yesterday ordered the City of Cape Town speaker to decide whether or not the motion of no confidence in the mayor should be done by secret ballot. Mayor Patricia de Lille said she was happy her case had been heard. “I’m very happy that the court confirmed I was justified in bringing this matter to court,” she said. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv9ykCZNKeAyTMO1pbhP4EfWp_COBihx09XwWPJkNSehMTLUAIS4csUDk4ItOGXEf4kM7kyIT3bq11rP8Hb1ezkrYqwNrqTzIGJ2W6rpxZF1EoiFyvn_0Z4FharBwAC-jIj7Fe1dZQ5KmOOcK0wC9p1Xw40YUUPuLhByMoGyltym0jKJjk3mT9Kk43rlVQ9RJzXv7I6N34nj0lxIIxQo__DRelXcX2u6tnJWxhU31R0gq3j_DpfomIEaFeDF7rc_zBPxl7odZJ6lqiXPN2dTp2uHJcojFM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA08n35MfIusEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Henney said Selfe should have known better as someone who had encountered several votes of no confidence as an MP.
