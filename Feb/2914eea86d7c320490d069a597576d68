FINANCE Minister Malusi Gigaba is having a hard time in Parliament, balancing the country's finances taking into consideration the R51 billion budget deficit.In
his speech, Gigaga highlighted the fact that a fund with an allocation
of R2.1 billion will be developed over the medium term, between the Departments
of Small Businesses, Science and Technology, in order to remove the barriers to
entry, which are faced by many of the South African youth in trying to start
businesses."To resolve this, our competition authorities continue
to do the necessary and important work of addressing barriers to entry and
rooting out anti-competitive behaviour which slows economic growth and dynamism,"
