beer slowly down a penis while a student kneels and lets the beer drip into his
mouth!The students shave their hair into strange designs, dress
up in cheap suits for the Lads Weekend and perform their drinking rituals in
the city’s parks.Other drinking games include drinking out of shoes –
known as “doing a shoey”. One particularly extreme one is a competition known
as the “Throwie Cup”. Students have to drink 24 beers as quickly as possible. Those
who throw up then have to drink their own vomit!An unnamed former student of Evatt House is quoted in the
report as saying: “From the first day, alcohol was just present … consumption
of alcohol was encouraged as a cheat-cut to meet people.“The first year students, predominantly women, drank at a
rate where they were throwing up. They were put in a situation where, if there
were people there that wanted to commit assault, they were vulnerable to that.“I think that for a lot of people, [going to college] is
kind of an adventure. It’s the first time away from home, and you’re all going
through the same thing … but the students who are straight out of school, they
will drink more than they should. They don’t tend to know what their limits
are. O-Week is the time when people are put most at risk.”A university spokeswoman said in a statement that the
safety of its students across the campuses was its “top priority”. We take any
reports of inappropriate behaviour very seriously.”
