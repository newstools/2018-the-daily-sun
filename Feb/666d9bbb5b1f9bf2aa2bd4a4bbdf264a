They collected household waste and cleared illegal dumps in the area.Ward councillors, local business owners, workers and volunteers from the community came out in numbers to offer their support, despite the drizzly weather. Khawe challenged residents to join hands and clean up Emfuleni.“All of us must come together and fight illegal dumping. “We rely on our residents to safeguard their environment. “Cleanliness starts with communities,” he said. “I challenge all ward councillors to continue engaging communities in this cleaning campaign.” The cleaning campaign takes place every fortnight, when service delivery departments gather in an identified area to deliver services. Resident Nomvula Zwane said she was stunned.“We know mayors as people in suits but Khawe comes down to the people and makes sure services are rendered to us.”
