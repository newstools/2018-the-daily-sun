She was 17 at the time and it changed her life forever. “It gave me a platform to grow in the industry,” she said.She’s worked with her mum, veteran actress Candy Moloi, on set.“It was a purely professional relationship. We were not mother and daughter. In fact, we hardly spoke.”But when she was offered a two-year extension on her contract, Zah promptly turned it down.“I said no. I wish I hadn’t. I went through a period of being lost and getting found,” she told the People’s Paper.“It was like going through a fire in a refinery until I was cooked. “But once I was cooked I knew what I needed to do.”She has portrayed different characters on shows like Rockville, Skeem Saam, Thola and The No 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency. She’s currently playing a cop on Rhythm City, a role she thoroughly enjoys.“It’s a role that came at the right time – when I was really hoping to get into a soapie,” she said.As a presenter, she was on shows like Gospel Gold, In Your Defence and most recently, Our Perfect Wedding.When asked about her experience on on Gospel Gold, Zah, said: “Being around ministers all the time was a healing experience.”
 She also said that her mother, Candy Moloi, has been a huge influence on her life.

 “My mother is a hard worker and has always been the breadwinner, but she’s also taught me to remain humble at all times,” she said.
