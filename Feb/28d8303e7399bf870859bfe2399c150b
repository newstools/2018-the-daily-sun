I have retired from my teaching job and our focus now is on developing softball around our township. “Participating in this sport will help kids stay away from crime, drugs and many other illegal activities.“So we are very happy and thankful towards Hi-Five, and we can assure you that people will be surprised to see how fast softball grows in Atteridgeville once more. “We are fully committed to have youngsters playing in the national team without avail and going to the 2020 Olympic Games in Japan.” Hi-Five CEO and South Africa softball women’s Under-19 junior coach Hayley Scott says the reason they chose Atteridgeville is because of the commitment they have seen from the Assdec officials.“I love softball and people who love softball,” she said. “I have seen that they love softball here in Atteridgeville and have all the facilities to play it, but kids did not have kit. So I felt it would be great for us to donate kit so that they can play in it. “This will help them feel they belong in the sport and inspire them to work harder. We love to see the development of softball and we hope this will help the young kids. “We were impressed with the professionalism shown by the Assdec officials and the commitment they have to softball.”
