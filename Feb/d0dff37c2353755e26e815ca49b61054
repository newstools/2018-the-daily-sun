I have been praying very hard for God to help me with my condition. “This has changed my life completely. I can’t eat properly because I have lost teeth. My nose is blocked and I can only breathe through my mouth. I can’t see properly through my left eye.” Zungu, who lost his wife to cancer, said he was touched by Luthuli’s story. “She needs money to travel to Joburg to see specialists who can help her with her condition. “The donation will go towards her travel costs and medical expenses, which are her most urgent needs.” He said this was not where his help for Luthuli would end as the foundation would continue helping her until she recovered.
