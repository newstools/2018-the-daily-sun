IT WOULD be in Bidvest Wits’ best interests not to look at the statistics ahead of their Absa Premiership encounter with Cape Town City FC at Athlone Stadium on Saturday (6pm). The stats won’t make for good reading for the Clever Boys, as the Citizens have won five of their last eight matches in all competitions, while the Clever Boys have won just one, the rest ending in draws. The Mother City-based Citizens have broken the Clever Boys’ hearts four times this season, defeating them twice in the MTN8, as well as in the Nedbank Cup and league.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvLZD2q4qvN8j9aqvMRnG560zgOtOXwGw7Jyk62AlQosNZnh2t-QIzZWXb4LF3n0_25zr7X6IkTFe-DB0YJajpWNCCes0q1WMbppDgd8KMUqMavswcOiu_Q34KUO29pEHvIY_i51E7gx-MKO0Td6Xwv8McO-nCPtcD1vmjYqRmxxFXYma6LlH_akctSevQ2D4DKHotjpP2stpAfoESUewwcdCypPDJPJlZKQgaoHV4_scgfBmRr9xLZQj31PbugVreZp35n_b3-SnuH52v4aV5isQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAC5sBNyLFV-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The Cape outfit is sixth with 31 points from 21 matches. The Clever Boys are 11th in the table with 25 points from the same number of matches. But City will be out to continue their dominance over the Clever Boys,at the same time trying their best to avoid losing their third successive league game. McCarthy stressed that losing another league game was out of the question.  After seeing his side lose to Chiefs at FNB Stadium in their previous outing, he urged his charges to dust themselves off and get back on their feet. Said the coach: “We are not the type to give up. We have to get back to winning ways in our next league game. We have a lot of points to fight for – our goal is to finish as high as we can on the league table.” That appears to be a warning to Hunt, who must be tired of tasting defeat every time the two teams step onto the pitch. Like this story?
