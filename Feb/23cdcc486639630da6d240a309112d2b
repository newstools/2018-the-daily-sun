them.In the memorandum, they demanded to know if they would be paid and
asked to be informed of plans to pay outstanding debt to creditors.Van der Merwe said he and his management team would go over the
memorandum before they respond."The truth that we will give you won't always be what you
wanted to hear, but it will be the truth. The situation that we are in today is
not as a result of only our own making, but the result of external
forces," Van der Merwe said. On Wednesday, general manager Howard Pyoos said the Department of
Mineral Resources was not aware of any possible sale of the mine because they
had not filed for its transfer yet.The sale of mining rights requires approval from the minister.Pyoos told the workers that Swiss-based Charles King, which wanted
to buy the mine, had already paid a deposit."A portion of that memorandum... required a deposit and, if
the sale does not go through, that deposit must be given back to the
buyer," Pyoos said.Rapport reported on February 11 that Ajay Gupta had been spotted
at Optimum on Tuesday, February 6.SOURCE: FIN24
