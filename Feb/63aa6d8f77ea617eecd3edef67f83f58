ESKOM DESTROYS the illegal connections but hours later, the izinyoka have reconnected them.Some say it is because of poverty, others say it is greed or simply the love of television. But the problem is never  solved and still the children die.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsugh-Pk5wk1NiA2HFxgV6iCg9GwaQ2CkuRuCcLg1HzKnX0tM5nXVbJilwRsvXhsborHa3IMC9BI0nbVSka1R_ianXv0uj9A-w94K-8wSjO7I-3yhq-ug80Cfl_0GVUkokpYjdvgYHjHnSCvRw1e_yV6w8VFImbc7JvYV9Y2QWrEFcy1ICQll1K5TumEFpKwklT4SgzSkAbDPq-k4NwIeC86-TM3yBK4UE6SkTR-zHKEPnMLuBxuv8yazl4UWYq8yhtDP3IpmFjXT1kcrzH2oAX0vI0AzNM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJK7StY20v83EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But these pictures are not unique. This scene is repeated around the country wherever people have no electricity. In January, a child was electrocuted in Tswaing View and Eskom disconnected the illegal cables.But only a few hours later, the izinyoka were back and reconnected them.Since the first death in January, three other kids have lost their lives in this kasi. The next was in early February, the third on 9 February and the fourth on Saturday, 17 February.Residents are wondering whose child will be next.When Daily Sun visited the area over the weekend, children were playing among the cables.Some were seen walking barefoot, jumping over them, while playing hopscotch. Others were ignoring the cables, tempting fate.“Eskom technicians remove the illegal cables but only a few hours later, izinyoka connect them again,” said Maria Jonga, a resident.Phineas Chauke said they know who the izinyoka are.“But we are scared they will target us if we report them.” Maria Motau, who lost her granddaughter Omphile (5) on Saturday, said she doesn’t even have cables in her yard.“Neighbours came running to tell us Omphile had been electrocuted. When we got there my grandchild was dead.”Another victim Rehaugetswe Seanego (8) was also killed by the dangerous cables as he was playing with his friend a week before.Refilwe Kgomo (10) was electrocuted in the same kasi in January and Nhlanhla Sibeko (11) died when he walked over the cables after it rained.Daily Sun witnessed izinyoka connecting cables. While they were prepared to speak to The People’s Paper, they refused to be photographed. The men, all adults, were peacefully working with the cables as residents walked by, ignoring the activity.One of the men defended their illegal activities, saying the tragedies would force the government to accelerate electrification of their area.“We were promised electricity two years ago but we are still waiting. We have no idea when we will get it,” said one of them.Inquest dockets were opened at Rietgat Police Station in Soshanguve.Khulu Phasiwe of Eskom said it was very disturbing that children were often the victims.“We send our technicians to remove the cables but they are often put back as soon as they leave,” he said.He said they are organising education sessions to teach residents about the danger of the illegal connections.
