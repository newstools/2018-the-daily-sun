JACKSON Rikhotso’s family has been desperate to hear news of him since he was allegedly kidnapped on Friday. His wife Lizzy Motsweneng (54) said he was taken by unknown people in Alexandra, Joburg after she sent him to withdraw R200 from her account to buy mealie-meal for the family. Lizzy said when her husband took longer than usual to return, she called his phone. A strange man answered and told her he was busy. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu_TpvqFtRt2Mqykp_AK3g6xtlkwPIDQHJOFcbQjgURzSyWGmyzhe81oc5MgtHbzTfrcGiZXL11Z0epGr2FWqSkGfThkTVfmEN2duG7yqe87o3lCdtkKweyc4dOQujUkSekqNUBGwrlKILLkRDZgEKxhxXhUZGpVVP7Q2NQ8GnfqvJLv6B9YiDh6zFJoETvD-DgcJIScPxEZHSllZUwhDgIfD7_I6_YiozE1P-4w2EXvHUPTyNLvbJPeXdvsVTZbdc22_dvhx0JdRX3KCfbS7tUKAHLRtQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIyV6-KUcll1EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

When I called him again, his phone was off. “I started panicking and called Tracker to check where his car was.” She said she rushed to Alexandra cop shop to open a case of kidnapping. “The tracker company only gave us the car’s information the next day, after we got a case number. It was tracked in Soshanguve and then the signal was lost.” The family, with the Pretoria West cops, drove to the spot the tracker had last picked up the signal but they weren’t able to find anything. “I don’t sleep at night. I sit up waiting for him to knock on the door,” said Lizzy. Dineo Rikhotso said her father didn’t drink and was always at home. Alexandra police spokesman Captain Allie Kodisang said a case of kidnapping had been opened.
