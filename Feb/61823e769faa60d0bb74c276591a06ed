Edward thanked the party for allowing Zuma to serve the people in different capacities over the years.  “It is a privilege we will never take for granted. It was an honour that my father was deployed by the ANC.”  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv94ETFHcqCSiMuzhtmrPTmkBrgVlLPEhREad0Gm-A8p4kqy05AoWAjm5OtYSxv0GIBKjt_oqCjFPN7ZONNOsmRkPDlwUvuJd9ohFNDONcHoFb38JVKuQkV-2U0bqOJjnd9PS9Ewl2CvC1YJFi9lh2ecWDVx0rAzCD2Ep7I-95mgIzJUC7ZZR1NUysg_0AEF1GmGKiK72j2zIZPbGJbfeX-Fi5CuGFbLjkIQG5KKBkOdiLFqzp7mFKdE9LYLyNdqiLZd9fBS09vw8PS3fqpIP997AHZyl4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNSQ0kBolw11EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We believe that the ANC remains home for all the people of this country.”  He pleaded with Mzansi to demand radical economic transformation and for land restitution without compensation. “Settlers should never have peace in our country,” he said.
