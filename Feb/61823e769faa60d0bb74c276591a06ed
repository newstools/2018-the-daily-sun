Edward thanked the party for allowing Zuma to serve the people in different capacities over the years.  “It is a privilege we will never take for granted. It was an honour that my father was deployed by the ANC.”  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssalnfht0do0cJ1oFM-rQT3-7GtUByTjytN-d74_5KBmKwYHksnZ0sOfTRTP6s1Ca5du0xv-JaNpYidZ0rwx1iKoUooRSUnD8Gb3PGgJkYxcdoFaaGQOd0k2hABwA5l6-2o_Y8jpQ2v4aED8AmRak8X5a2UMFSxaYfat15uTEFeyCzEN_gopg_Bmei7fTePeJEzA38bmx4Xer9bN6KF5GDnHAjLrz-wpbxj3lULuxgMTiPSHzFu12d0DzvDFMvkMbaCkC3F8w-7GpwtxvwfPzWv3AXg5_M\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJ8C0I6MzzoUEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
