Edward thanked the party for allowing Zuma to serve the people in different capacities over the years.  “It is a privilege we will never take for granted. It was an honour that my father was deployed by the ANC.”  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsssiniT2jIN8tjgcWbCmE7u1DVzEQMC_pAer0ORZdAUILXZ8Bgi2DVLfrjvlBSITocpGSs4LYKyfyM6I_kgMZNAOFWEemHH7Hdrcr2U8kCCWmOrMIijaUFICb-RGFP8jz6R_SRJwPKcogwsBEwz4lLGK_L_Anb1hukg_HkvcYSjrzabMudZ7SyJTyd2BKjWbgreMhYR_5aBzdbUuj4Guk4HqpDrbQm4LQU6pE7GtZLLgpL5oEQMjoaakw_ZliUjB3tvq49O9SeuQnLyxTqO2hc-toXuY3M\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIPA-bFBk2-3EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
