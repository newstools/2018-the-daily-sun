Before I knew it I’d crashed into another car head-on.”He said he then went to his boss Cecil Frans the next day to explain what had happened.He claimed they agreed that the money to fix the bakkie would be deducted from his salary. “I was relieved that I was not being fired, but an hour later my boss came back with a sjambok and started assaulting me. He fired me on the spot,” said Khulile. He said he immediately went to the police to lay a charge against his boss. “He had no right to assault me. He should be locked up,” said Khulile. Hammanskraal police spokesman Constable Herman Moremi confirmed that a case of assault was opened. “The suspect was arrested and appeared in the Moretele Magistrates Court.” Cecil denied giving Khulile permission to use the bakkie. He said the company was going to open a case against Khulile for damaging the car.
