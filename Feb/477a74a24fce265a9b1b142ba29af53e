The thugs ran away.  “We fear one day these thugs will accomplish their evil mission,” said her neighbour Phephezani Sithole. Phephezani appealed to the government to move Busi and her kids to a safer place.“We’re worried she won’t be able to defend her children if they are attacked by thugs because she’s blind.” Busi went blind two years ago and Daily Sun ran her story on 6 July last year.The 27-year-old mum from Wattville, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun she fell pregnant despite having a birth control implant at a local clinic. Soon after that she started getting headaches and realised she was pregnant. Busi said she became blind after giving birth. “I was sleeping with my children when we heard the door being broken down. The thugs moved closer and I screamed. “I don’t know what would have happened had people not responded quickly. I could have been raped.”Gauteng Human Settlements spokesman Keith Khoza urged Busi to go to the department’s offices to apply for an RDP. “If she is unable to go, her details should be forwarded to the department and a team will be sent to her home to assist her with the application,” he said. “The department cannot assist her if she doesn’t apply. “If she qualifies she will be placed on a waiting list. She will be allocated a house that will accommodate her disability.” He said if there was no suitable housing project near her home, Busi could get a house in another area. Gauteng Health spokesman Prince Hamnca said the department was aware of Busi’s case. It will be investigated.
