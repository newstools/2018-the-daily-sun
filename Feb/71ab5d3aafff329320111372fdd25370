We will ratify decisions taken at the last congress where we agreed, among other issues, to change the calendar for the Caf club tournaments – the Champions League and Confederation Cup.”Mumble said he was looking forward to the world body’s summit in Oman. Said the Safa boss: “The meeting is a general one where member countries such as ourselves will be allowed to raise issues. “One issue I want to bring up is the crowded Fifa international calendar, which makes it difficult for countries in Africa, especially South Africa, to play friendly matches on other continents during the Fifa international breaks.“The problem we face is the long travelling time to play on other continents within the time frame allocated by Fifa. Also of concern is the packed international schedule both in Africa and the world, with Caf events and Fifa events, giving us little time to play countries on other continents.”Mumble said he wanted Bafana to get more exposure in Europe, Asia, South and North America in future to give players more experience of different countries and playing styles.Mumble said the issue was now more complicated with the recent launch by the European Football Association (Uefa) of the new Uefa Nations League that will involve  55 members. The league kicks off in November.Said Mumble: “The new Uefa Nations League will make it more difficult for us to play European sides in friendly games. “So hopefully we will be able to get our point across and Fifa can assist us with regard to possibly updating the Fifa international calendar to allow Bafana to spread their wings on other continents.”
