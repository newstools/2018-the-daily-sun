THERE simply can’t be any excuses for dismal performances in the Confederation of African Football (Caf) competitions, says Mamalodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane.Mosimane’s appreciation for African football extends far beyond his domestic achievements – and it’s rare to have a conversation about Caf without mentioning his continental successes.Mosimane has stuck to his guns, as various domestic clubs begin sojourns into Africa in search of continental recognition. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Again, Mzansi will be well represented with four teams participating on the African safari.Confederations Cup novices, Cape Town City, travelled to Swaziland for their preliminary round against Young Buffaloes yesterday, while Bidvest Wits played hosts to Mauritians, Pamplemousses, in their opening Champions League fixture.Downs are girding their loins for the Caf fixture early next month and Mosimane says a proper blueprint will do the trick.“You need to have a programme to manage fatigue, to keep the players fresh for each game,” said Mosimane.“We make excuses about travelling, excuses about lots of games. Of course, those things add to the result and performance of the team. But it comes down to planning and managing your programme. “What’s your plan for the hectic programme? We went to the Champions League finals and won. We went to the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan. And where did we finish on the log? Second with three points. We’re in the Champions League again, in the league and in the Nedbank Cup.”But the 2016 Champions League winner is under no illusion about the task awaiting the Brazilians in the coming months.Success in the Nedbank Cup means Sundowns could be competing across three competitions, the Absa Premiership included.“You need some rest and regeneration. It’s the type of training you do,” Mosimane explained.“That’s when the work of your physical trainer comes out. So we send our physical trainer overseas to go sit with the physical trainer of Real Madrid, of Manchester City. “How do you keep players fresh when you play in three tournaments in seven days? Which one do you prioritise, which one do you not?”Mosimane acknowledged the strength of the Caf opponents, like TP Mazembe and Al Ahly, who have the budget and sizeable squads. But in the same breath said: “As local teams, we have the numbers too.”Said Mosimane: “We can afford to travel. SuperSport are a big company that back the team, Bidvest back Wits. Pirates and Chiefs are big clubs with major sponsors. So we can’t complain. It’s how you manage your programme.”Like this story?
