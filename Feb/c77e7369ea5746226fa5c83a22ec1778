RESIDENTS who live in Nyandeni Street in Site C, Khayelitsha hate going outside their homes. This is because of an unbearable smell which is caused by dirty water from a blocked drain. Resident Sivuyile Caka (44), whose three-roomed shack is next to the drain, said he was living in hell. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Sivuyile said they do not have the option of keeping windows open in the hot Cape Town weather. “This has turned life into a living hell for me. In the morning I hate going outside. Whenever I am home, I keep my windows and doors closed because of the smell from the drain.” Sivuyile showed Daily Sun his body was riddled with a rash and he believes it was a result of cleaning the drain.“I cleaned the drain a few weeks ago, but after a few days I got this rash on my body,” he said. The drain overflows with thick, kak-like substances and has become a breeding place for mosquitos and other water- borne little creatures.Residents said they often keep their kids indoors because they fear they may contract some sickness. Father of two Ayanda Sokuyeka (38) said they fear for their kids.“Our kids may get sick because some people already have some weird rashes on their bodies.“We don’t know what is biting us. This could be caused by the stagnant kak water in our street,” said Sokuyeka.Councillor Xanthea Limberg, member of the mayoral committee for informal settlements, water and waste services and energy, said the reported blockage was not at a sewage pipe but a storm water drain, and it was being attended to.“The reason for the smell is due to the fact that many private and illegal waste pipes are connected from homes and businesses such as salons, and the waste water from those premises drains into the main road and ends up in the storm water system. “This is what has caused the blocked drain,” she said.Limberg said discharging grey water or sewage into the stormwater system was illegal.“Assist us by reporting illegal dumping or illegal connections to the city’s call centre on 0860 103 089 or by sending an SMS to 31373,” said Limberg.
