CRICKET South Africa’s rural cricket programme received a major boost when the Shyam Bhatia Cricket for Care Foundation donated 50 bags of cricket equipment.This equipment will be distributed through the CSA Members for the development of cricket within the rural regions of the country. Each bag contains 3 arm guards, 6 cricket balls, 3 cricket bats, 2 helmets, 1 pair of wicket-keeping gloves, 3 pairs of batting leg-guards, 3 pairs of batting gloves, 3 thigh pads, and abdominal guards (see photograph attached). “This is a tremendous gesture by the Shyam Bhatia Foundation,” commented Edward Khoza, CSA Cricket Services Manager. “Rural cricket is a very important part of our development pipeline and it urgently needs resources so that we can fulfill our vision of making cricket a truly national sport accessible to all.”The Shyam Bhatia Cricket For Care was established in 2004 with the concept of taking cricket to underprivileged children around the world, who could not have otherwise afforded to play cricket or look at cricket as a sport and career. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuPDX8HNEZtVK23EtYCB72aUJOxQvKCL648o12P2PPWEFjmJz3qzxLCLlAU3qHyUna1L-0nQOdzF9O1rDP2bcSf3JbYw6LiaWXFclXaAnrWjG6-mCU4cxg2GGx-tRO119XE_FghF1S2S6Fk2Xbf_tsJu1wflm06P7IuqXsTzNhrjCAEVc3GsRuaiVGY1DSVcwe_-ZcvHENYOeiiWKfBJjw4NjOCuf78XiLysxscr7O9dqsPuimLc8pT9C2TzMd7a0dg5ak7X7yVki0hxepz\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAIkQvBNY4AQEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
