Branch secretary Sindane Mashabi said: “Black teachers are treated like rubbish by the principals and the community in this area. “We don’t want the Eldorado Park or Freedom Park secondary school principals any more.”Daily Sun reported the situation last Wednesday.Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said the department was aware of the situation and was concerned about the serious allegations levelled against the principal. The department has instituted an independent investigation into the matter, which is expected to conclude in two weeks.
