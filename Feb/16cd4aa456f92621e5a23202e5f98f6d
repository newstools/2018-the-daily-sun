SINCE 2001, Maria Mokoena’s life has been on hold and neighbours have taken to calling her the walking ghost.This is because the 50-year-old from Benoni, Ekurhuleni, was mistakenly declared dead by Home Affairs.Maria told Daily Sun: “I first discovered that I was dead when I went to borrow money from the bank. The cashier asked me when I had left my grave.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv3yLEQmb42GkETsJVHBF52JZ78_L0ZOwE9YmCf1jSNDjur1choqFdD8xitcokqclOtjFquOyBdTm7pSS5J00CfxNGKpxWLjdpPij0d3zh3rwaHNSWgJ9IU5v9plFUKisLBlv2ua6uEj7LTIT_MLYf6S6L8N084z4aGn48tPUFmeaj-sPhRtJFgUt5GRcDw3GxnGeoi2U9SFCuPCxBw1fYTxJiSuHK2MLyFyFQ2kBWe852VfBxgi-YrYhFlmt5Gu0zzvRcpUNSpYPRq1C1OaiOoge2JDlc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGUxi7JtVjedEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Since then, she hasn’t been able to open an account.“I’m as good as dead. My two kids have no IDs. I had to get an affidavit from the cops to have my son admitted to school,” she said.“I want Home Affairs to reverse the death certificate and give me back my identity.” Maria said she had made several unsuccessful attempts to fix the problem.  “Whenever I go to Home Affairs in Benoni, they tell me to bring more documents back. It’s very difficult to get the problem fixed because my mum and my three siblings died a long time ago. I’m the only living member of my family,” she said.  “Home Affairs wants a card from the clinic where I was born and a letter from the primary school I attended. I can’t find the clinic card. I’m struggling.”Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the department would be in contact with Maria soon.
