PARIS St. Germain forward Neymar left Barcelona in order to escape the shadow of Lionel Messi and increase Brazil’s chances of winning this year’s World Cup, says club and country teammate Dani Alves.Neymar became the world’s most expensive footballer in August when he completed a €222 million (more than R3,2 bilion)) transfer from Barcelona to PSG.The 25-year-old finished third behind Messi and Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2017 Ballon d’Or.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>“I think Neymar is up there with Messi as the most influential player in world football. The thing is, he had to come out of Messi’s shadow a little,” Alves said.“Playing with someone as unique as Leo is the most incredible thing that can happen to you, but there’s always that doubt in your mind whether you really have the quality or if it’s all him.“It was important for Ney’s own development and for Brazil for him to follow his own path.”PSG have opened an 11-point gap at the top of Ligue 1, with Neymar contributing 17 goals and 11 assists.However, Alves believes Neymar’s main objective this season is to deliver PSG’s first Champions League title.“It’s our main goal. It’s what Neymar was thinking when he left Barca and it’s what I was thinking when I left Juventus. That’s what moves us,” he added.“We’re ready to compete and the question of whether that preparation leads us to victory or elimination is going to depend on how we work as a team.”PSG resume their European campaign on 14 February in the first leg of a Last 16 tie against holders Real Madrid. – REUTERS
