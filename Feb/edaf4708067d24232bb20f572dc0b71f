FORMER Arsenal and Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri has been banned for six months for a doping offence, UEFA said on Tuesday.The disciplinary board of European soccer's ruling body found the Frenchman "guilty of using a prohibited method in accordance with the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) prohibited list".Nasri's lawyer said the case was the result of a drip treatment the player took at a Los Angeles clinic after falling ill and vomiting while on holiday in 2016.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsswQgoCa_xiQ3oeWzt4crS-jZunTuHy9apJ9-qs_QJUb43GSi5lKnJ7kWA3fuzof5AK7JSadax3bB2py6mBx4xX1322tYmd6kq-0WhtamrXyYivl3A1kGCGahehujo4IidZMVLdCNrMAj1zh3gniON9Uji9njL-gAGjNJsjPNzvh0LhNvyeyssm5J_sdgE0-M2wApezZlmrSjXF2JLUf7ZEtGArzjyqm6Y2rlVPQ4iloibu7oB00h7eSDtm8NxQZ007l4krUgl9bJ25nVM_\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLX-t3TWqStoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
