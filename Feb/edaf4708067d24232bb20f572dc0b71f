FORMER Arsenal and Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri has been banned for six months for a doping offence, UEFA said on Tuesday.The disciplinary board of European soccer's ruling body found the Frenchman "guilty of using a prohibited method in accordance with the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) prohibited list".Nasri's lawyer said the case was the result of a drip treatment the player took at a Los Angeles clinic after falling ill and vomiting while on holiday in 2016.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst5Ok-rdvS1mNEGijj6wU9Hz_CNKywce_VJGZsZXGkaBnNHpnIqYsaBik11UJK8nn2Fj7P9OhMwcucgvNFqRVKl98FlGih-6AaNt9zHgyfShOOYqP-L3srciAHyA8AaCqW3geepN327HeibFuo_-7dfFxfZe4elM1PzvAwIWGb5G23cDA-Gg1NdAmuhxwgKN-oVfETS5P-vOOFYxAyp9qeAQ7ajXRDa6rmKttDutZK5AtCuDMY5n7yqBPD-vZuTtj5kd9NozCNZTQ5JaPPY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMfXYd87iEcyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
