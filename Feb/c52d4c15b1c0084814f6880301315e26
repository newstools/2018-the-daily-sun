CHIPPA UNITED’S new hero Linda Mntambo has vowed to keep his feet firmly on the ground after displaying outstanding performances in his Absa Premiership return.Mntambo took the Premier Soccer League (PSL) by storm, scoring three goals in his first four matches with Chippa United after joining them from National First Division (NFD) side Jomo Cosmos. Despite scoring those goals and scooping three Man of the Match accolades, the midfielder feels he still has a lot to do in order to become a complete player.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstGCqK-mF-asRhzFTZVXOJWR6wRjyaUyvzjDRahhfsukh45w9MmrEJ-_EIV5s5_qhgmcrXDyesvw0uaS6QRtYyEj7HG0Yb5c_dnZ-SEl8FCgYqMPAHMferZ9LYG2nAMzXDI1P3vnqoVytaQfmqU8Cht8q9CmWgM9mHMNU58R4o8tF17QiKoSDHCVaFTnoCM_C3r8CcXNwz7ODui46gh0iBweukCLmG0DPmAAA32AUFhTQ47MQs5Vl_uv8lJVvGp4B3WJLMLft9wV5EXm-RgWb9LlQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOx-EYS8P-qXEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I can do well and win Man of the Match awards, but if the team don’t get all the points it doesn’t really count,” said a determined Mntambo.After four games in the second round Chippa have only collected six points from three draws (1-1 against Maritzburg United and Bidvest Wits as well as a goalless draw with Golden Arrows). Plus a 2-0 victory over AmaZulu where Mntambo scored a brace.Getting Seven out of 12 is a concern to the new acquisition.He said: “We need maximum points, not draws. Playing attractive football without getting results is not right. Eventually, you find yourself involved in the relegation zone.“I started well, so I’ll need to maintain that performance to become a better player.”Like this story?
