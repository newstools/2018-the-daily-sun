TWO people were caught red-handed in Muldersdrift allegedly trying to fill tankers of water to drive down to the Western Cape on Wednesday night, the Mogale City Municipality said.“This is a gross violation of the rights of the citizens of Mogale City,” said mayor Naga Lipudi.He said the municipality sympathises with the City of Cape Town as it faces the water crisis, and would help with an official operation, but it would not allow water to be taken illegally.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvcniIzWylWNoFLo_UHlcmYNdqqdaF7bIcgRA6cmvhLjwsRWgvbpoA0UTALhLST4Cn0rsAFJDBRmPYWeyPmt9qn4TE5d7_FlYAR55Lki7Sun7GnU50k0q9BQc8AP2o0dxa0Vfbvh9B3swZxojXIFxmFoRXkeCv3VD3VOWEg9mqtcYZTiOAqQ4Ku5Mxyu9XxYjpksfUeMNzAjfvqmGjA7HqH6eL0tMdQK7lWYv_Ku2u3IvqG2qIxmosqRk7BTrvcYMWHSJE-V7RxTUaGwObr12MTrxSrvGw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPpQRgH_hrp3EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Taking this scarce resource from the people of Mogale City without asking is theft,” said Lipudi.“Our people pay for water and everybody who uses it must pay. Unaccounted for water is one of the auditor-general’s matters of emphasis, so we must ensure that we account for each drop.”A police spokesman was not immediately available to say whether the suspects were charged. – NEWS24
