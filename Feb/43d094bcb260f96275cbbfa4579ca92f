Human trafficking will leave us in a poor state if we continue to ignore it.” He told Daily Sun churches across the country should pray for the victims, poor and homeless people.Capricorn acting mayor Jara Masubelele said: “It is important to note that men, women and children are all trafficked.”He also said human trafficking should always be reported to the police.
