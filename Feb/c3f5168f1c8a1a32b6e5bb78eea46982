I was told he would only pay my medical bills,” she said.Prudence said at first she thought she would be okay, but then the pain in her leg got worse and she could not go to work. She realised that she needed more compensation than just hospital costs.She went back to the doctor, who said the pain would not ease up any time soon.“Since the time I went to hospital, the people from the construction site have not bothered to check on me.“Now I live in pain and my hospital and transport bills are piling up,” she said.She said she cannot use public transport and has to hire a private car with a driver to take her to work and pick her up again.Construction supervisor Oupa Kutumela said they agreed to pay Prudence’s medical bills and the rest would be discussed as soon as she got better.
