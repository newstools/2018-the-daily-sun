If you don’t beat them then you make sure they don’t win against you,” explained Ngoma.“That’s what we did in the previous two fixtures. And I don’t think it’s going to be any different now. We don’t want teams getting closer and closer to us. We have to go into the game bearing in mind that they are in competition and we can’t drop points against them. We have to win at all cost.”The Sundowns winger shared Pitso Mosimane’s plan on how to “manage competition” and stay clear of nearest rivals in the next 10 games.Ngoma has so far made four appearances for the Pretoria giants, but is already fulfilling Mosimane’s philosophy.Ngoma had not yet joined the Brazilians when they thumped Stars with a Percy Tau-inspired 2-0 win in September.But he is well aware that matches against Ea Lla Koto are no ordinary fixtures these days.Luc Eymael’s side are in league title contention, wedged between the top five who also include Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs and Cape Town City.“I think the Stars coach and his players have done very well to have such a good league run so far. We can never underestimate their form and capabilities at the moment,” said Ngoma.“It’s a team that’s playing well and getting results. So We have to prepare very well, like we do with any other opponent and hopeful emerge victorious tomorrow. It’s going to be tough though.”The league is still open though Ngoma admitted they have an edge sitting at the top with a four-point gap.Said Ngoma: “As long as it’s still mathematically open anyone still has a chance. But at the moment it’s still in our hands and we don’t want to rely on anyone by winning our games.”Ngoma has refused to look far ahead to the Tshwane derby against SuperSport United this weekend nor the upcoming Nedbank Cup quarterfinal against lowly side EC Bees.The immediate challenge is the most important.
