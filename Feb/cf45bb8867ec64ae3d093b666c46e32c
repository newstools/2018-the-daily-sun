at the Gupta-owned Optimum Coal Mine in Mpumalanga downed tools on Wednesday
over the uncertainty of their jobs and the future of the mine.A large
group of striking mineworkers gathered at the main gate of the mine early on
Wednesday morning.Many of
them were still clad in their blue overalls and safety boots. They sang songs
and waited for management to address them.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvQIgYKV_cR9SUCA_njCiylNavv-IR_Cg-1RH59GUIMjjI6ZINUcxdSpwPua1VnU23jvX-RXQYAFeai71oJuYOBOP6cgl61YnCV-1agEResjat1FczIcaSys41eurYIcyagk7C1rZKtDZ8hNSzywx3YU9NqKpqBnZOT7BmlIRJVETPqenFPdUW9n_alvTQsrVTnyJvs_GRlNCSwNjoc33cj7bzeNtnUIUNXj0dpo7uqpdB9GRp_mOGlCsVRER_gHfxRV0U6YozHU_RNHHIW9Vuu-sc3DyE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLuG8otC0y2tEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Mguzulu, branch secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), said
staff were afraid of losing their jobs since it's been reported in the media
that the Guptas "are all over the place"."There
is no one that is addressing us and we don’t know what is the future of the
mine. We have been told suppliers have not been paid for months and that is an
indication that this mine at any time, is going to close," Mguzulu said.He said
they had tried several times to approach management, but their pleas fell on
deaf ears."On
the other side, the employees are pressurising us as leadership to know what
the future of the mine is," he said.Mining
minister approval neededThe mine's
general manager Howard Pyoos, later addressed the striking workers.He said the
Department of Mineral Resources was not aware of any possible sale of the mine
because they had not filed for its transfer yet.The sale of
mining rights required approval from the mining minister.Pyoos told
the workers that Swiss-based King Charles, who wanted to buy the mine, had
already put in a deposit."A
portion of that memorandum... required a deposit and, if the sale does not go
through, that deposit must be given back to the buyer," Pyoos said.One of the
workers in the crowd asked Pyoos about the arrest of the Guptas by the Hawks
last week.Pyoos said
management could not comment on every article published in the media.He said a
meeting was supposed to take place with the leadership on Monday to discuss a
way forward."The
confirmation that we needed, that we had hoped for on Friday would be true, was
not true – so we cancelled the meeting. I don't want to communicate something
which I am not sure of – whether you call me a liar or whatever, it's
fine," he said.Rapport
reported on February 11 that Ajay was spotted at the Optimum mine on Tuesday,
February 6.Ajay landed
in a helicopter at the mine with Ronica Ragavan, the chief executive of the
Guptas' holding company Oakbay Investments, who was arrested by the Hawks
during raids at Gupta properties last week, in relation to a case involving the
Estina dairy farm. She was later released on bail.SOURCE: NEWS24
