South Africa simply cannot afford to invest in nuclear energy at
present, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Thursday.He was speaking at a post-Budget 2018 breakfast event hosted by
Brimstone at the Cape Town International Convention Centre.Gigaba said Eskom has more than enough power supply to meet the
economy's current demands. On top of that, the renewable energy programme is
also coming on stream.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstU7urClL9q--HtbaRHTS7_FaLiehJ0FfEt1Dxu-_RQsLDF6ioqJWhWBPcAPBX3L8q5Oqd-rx6Sl15XfE_P4RI0AR34IeqdrKfFm5g-iUGZf4YkJHJNWlE5wGk5gt3o2r54hNpVKsXjdAG3x4dHGIRdK3n5w12p70fhCSOyBlcWUGCjet1C4EhM0L0Pd0oYsIFluu_gSOclKDpGkUuD9TjfBos_NIu5BfLYhOX1-ucq56QdocaSC8v23QwgUXZ4cs21r7DVuTURZCOwDRg8KG4hr8_ngbc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzG_TuC0RXhYVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

the economy - including mining and manufacturing - is kicking. We will also
reduce coal power stations and focus more on renewable electricity
generation," said Gigaba."We would then have to look at base-load power supply and at
that moment we might decide we need nuclear. It will be an open process, maybe
in five years' time."Only Cabinet can decide to scrap nuclearHe said the policy on nuclear has not been changed and only
Cabinet can decide to scrap the nuclear option.As for the increase in value-added tax (VAT) announced in his
Budget Speech on Wednesday, Gigaba said this step was probably already a year
or two overdue."We first had to squeeze the budget until we ran out of
options to cover the shortfall," he said.Gigaba explained that the question asked in compiling Budget 2018
was whether to defer making some difficult decisions now, only to be forced to
make them later.In his view, 80% of people affected by the VAT increase will be
higher income earners, while the remaining 20% will benefit from free higher
education and grants."Financial markets have reacted well to the decisions we made
this time. We have engaged with them to highlight the challenges we are
facing," he said.Free higher educationOn the topic of free higher education Gigaba said this was a
milestone decision, which must be implemented in a way that actually benefits
the poor in South Africa so that even the unemployed can send their children to
university and break the cycle of poverty for the entire family."This does not mean we do not have to go through some pain in
the process. Fee-free education does not mean fee-free for the government and
the rest of the people of SA. At the same time, we need to be very blunt and
not spend money on people who keep on failing," he said."If we educate our children and give them degrees and diplomas,
you take them away from social grants. In this way we are shaping the future
while providing for todayâ€™s needs."In his view, starting to implement fee-free tertiary education
while government is trying to balance the books was a bold move."We cannot do everything. We must try and live within our
means and do what we can afford. Budget 2018 is a balance between unlimited
needs and limited resources. It is also about balancing the needs of today with
future demands," he said.SOURCE: FIN24
