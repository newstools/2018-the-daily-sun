A BRIDGE linking two small villages outside Port St Johns collapsed yet again due to heavy rain on Wednesday.  The situation has brought daily life in Mvume Village to a standstill. The villagers depended on the bridge to get to nearby Mantusini Village, where there are shops, a school and a clinic. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuAjQ1ZVCOYgLIJGGhvaRY8HrwNcf4M9K-6iprQRstPbszTMg-kxRvdKvrDg8f1Isf6nXzbGUwv5svVJTVV4OSXEcggSNymkLzox50PxIzrl9afA2cGjKte7YtVkD-Uho2ynY382g_KalSyk9cWR7xOPOyIivavRA9XDz738gw-tL9S2GBe5xdmx-IG2XJq6yBDtlXabaJMuipyAoGAQri5EJdPxGeT_29Qo-4w0wrVxd4bsK4SwW47M8aQYpjwmoX0TfIW8lZt6dPkYWwWRjW9qnjP_OA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNKJ4dBke7oiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Mfundisi said they were forced to cancel classes this week as many pupils could not go to school.“We are not sure when the bridge will be fixed, but until something is done the lives of pupils who try to cross the swollen river are in danger,” he said. Nompandana said many village activities had been disrupted. “It has affected ploughing, as tractors cannot cross from one side of the river to the other. The cows have only a small patch of grass to graze,” he said.“If the bridge is not fixed by Monday, elderly people will not be able to go to town to buy food when they receive their pension money.” According to villagers, the bridge was built in 1920 by a white businessman and it was upgraded by the apartheid government in the 1980s. It first collapsed in 2013. Eastern Cape public works spokesman Mphumzi Zuzile said a team had been sent to assess the damage. “Our technicians are assessing the damage as we speak.“When they are done, they will write a report and recommend what needs to be done,” Zuzile said.“We cannot rebuild the bridge until we have their recommendations.”
