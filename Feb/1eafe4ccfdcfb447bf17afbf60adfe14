But residents must play their part to make it happen. “Each of us has a unique set of skills that will benefit the community.“We have skills in education, arts and culture, law and business.”Henney said the organisation wanted to tackle each project one step at a time. “Charity organisations are here to serve the community. “We will not only just serve you now, but in future as well.”He said education has been a priority for the organisation since last year. “It’s time for all South Africans to come together and demand quality education,” he said. Henney said crime and drug abuse were plaguing the community. According to him, thousands of crimes were reported in Heidedal during the current financial year.Hubert Barlow, a resident, said he could not sit back and watch as crime and substance abuse ruined his community. We are here to see how we can serve the people in our kasi. “A lot of local business owners are ready to give back to the community, but they need something tangible and credible to support.”
