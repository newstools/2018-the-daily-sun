Our friendship will stop for 90 minutes.”Tinkler said he was expecting a tough game from De Sa’s charges, as Dikwena are fighting for their lives.The Rustenburg-based Stars are bottom of the standings with 16 points from 20 games, while Matsatsantsa a Pitori are in 12th place with 24, eight points ahead of Stars. Struggling Dikwena come into this must-win encounter winless in five consecutive league matches this year – losing four and drawing one. The last time Stars, now owned by De Sa and three business partners, tasted victory was on 16 December last year when they beat Bidvest Wits 1-0. “Stars are a dangerous side because of the position they are in,” Tinkler said. “They want to move away from the bottom. So we need to be in our best form and should not look at their position in the standings.” De Sa holds the same view: “Points are my priority, nothing else!”“This is Platinum Stars versus SuperSport United not Roger against Eric, and our aim is to fight for the three points. “We are not in a good position, and in the 10 games remaining we have to get to 30 points to be safe. “We have to work hard and fight for victory in our remaining games.” De Sa will welcome back his veteran midfielder Robert N’gambi after he was rested in their 1-0 defeat to Baroka FC in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 round a week ago.United will also be bolstered by the return to action of Riyaad Pieterse, Reneilwe Letsholonyane, Dean Furman, Thuso Phala and Evans Rusike. They were all given a break in the Ke Yona cup, where SuperSport lost on penalties to Bloemfontein Celtic at the Dr Molemela Stadium a week ago.
