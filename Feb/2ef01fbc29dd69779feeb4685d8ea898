UNHAPPY parents believe the only way to get attention is to set the school on fire. On Tuesday morning they chased pupils, teachers and guards from Mavimbela Primary School in Calcutta, near Hazyview in Mpumalanga, and set it on fire. They burned 18 classrooms and the admin block and barricaded the school gate with burning tyres. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>They said the education department needed to build them a new school as it was dilapidated and posed a danger to kids. On Wednesday they protested, demanding the release of two SGB members arrested during the protest. Officials from the department who came to assess the damage had to leave without doing anything.  Parent Adorl Lubisi (35) said: “We have been fighting with them since 2014. This building is a death trap.  “We’ll rather keep them at home until a new school is built than let them share a classrooms with rats and bats that have created a shelter there.” Education spokesman Jasper Zwane condemned the torching of the school. Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said an investigation was launched and two women SGB members were arrested and appeared at the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court on Tuesday.  They were granted R1000 bail each.
