WHENEVER residents cross Tshabuse Street, they pray it won’t lead them to their graves. The street outside Avalon Cemetery in Chiawelo, Soweto has claimed a number of lives over the years. On Friday, after yet another crash, residents decided they were gatvol and blocked the street with rocks. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu9Igja7jseBAGyuDSvOXowwdfbKt4t_9gYK4GbwVBNeL1Vik1rL7nE9wg68tRbMjQOwQeC1QtwaQsLrKjga_a3-GZAo9psbqWO2ox4Pz_8yf9INGM985nHoxcIjNCKhtdF-byRJxDeFKqt1pFynL70BmtNtlJxSww81UYBx2kwIif_0MEzucBljvgMc_ECGxrGCjB8sUhryEF9OOmLzkWVi4FbryjqQ8Mk_UiSOFM1c8Fuqusj-xDzrlwP6iUi8im324k4_WpszMogxuh3U_P0qtcSMms\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIvgNV7keEiHEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

If people don’t die on this road, they are seriously injured.” Ruth told the SunTeam she had witnessed five accidents on the road, some of which had killed people. Sarah Mulaudzi said the community held a special meeting asking the councillor for speed humps. “We have been asking councillors over the years to do something about this road but none of them seem to take us seriously. “We have given them 72 hours to take action or we will dig up this road.” Councillor Meisie Maluleke told the SunTeam she supported the residents. “People are killed every week and it’s becoming too much to bear. The issue of this road was discussed even before I became councillor but no changes have been made.” She said she held a meeting with residents and sent a petition to the Joburg Roads Agency, which promised to get back to them within 72 hours.
