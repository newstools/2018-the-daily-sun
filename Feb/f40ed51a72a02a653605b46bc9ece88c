Mphandeni rushed to the cop shop to help when he heard gunshots on Wednesday last week. There, gunmen shot the brave soldier four times. Warrant Officer Zuko Mbini (45), Constable Zuko Ntsheku (38), Constable Nkosiphendule Pongco (32), Constable Kuhle Mateta (27) and Constable Sibongiseni Sondlana (32) were also killed as armed gunmen stormed the station and stole weapons. Speaking about his son Nkosiphendule, Xolile Pongco said it was part of God’s plan. “His mum worked hard to raise him to become the man he was.” Constable Mateta’s father Julius said his son studied information design but wanted to be a policeman. “He loved his job.” Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union president Zizamele Cebekhulu said: “When cops shoot, they end up in court.”Premier Phumulo Masualle sent his condolences to the six families. He said the church believed to have been involved in the tragedy would be closed.
