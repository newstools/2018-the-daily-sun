The Economic Freedom Fighters' request for a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma has been scheduled for February 22, a day after the budget speech.Parliament's presiding officers on Thursday said they had rejected the EFF's request to hold the motion before next week's State of the Nation Address (SONA).This year's SONA will go ahead as planned next week, irrespective of who is president of the country, they said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsss3YgQnWdDk_diVErNNTit4TYNUADG5vKI77MHJ4HT7Wr5NvZuBblTtEDGtnh6Q_Di9s4UwJKG8bXfScNH4jTqq0qJIXot5bljOFkskgMUwHe3mh2xUslNOJOdBTqNjwprouLZ81wpp4LWS2L0s_-YVwPBNemYt99XtEERW3uzYPY5RoaUKRAlwZ2Yz7oXkJC9HlCxG9UfgtIlfzEOwdiYskol4k0W2D-PzuB4SxtLrexbBpMnW_2P0PJxpnhgC7cMN0N9aYcZarFWf0aOP1CFqDRyWsM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHke7SBK6jS_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
