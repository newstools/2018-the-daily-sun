said that he wrote to Council Speaker Vasco Da Gama requesting the allegations
to be investigated.Mashaba
defended himself and rubbished the claims.“I have
declared my financial interests and those of my family,” he said.“In the
process of trying to bring dignity to our security personnel, through in-sourcing,
I reached out to a security sector expert with the skills we needed to advise
us.“I did so
with the full knowledge of the Mayoral Committee and coalition partners,” he
said.Mashaba
maintains that there was no conflict of interest.“The simple
truth was that this move to in-source security guards in the City caused a lot
of unhappiness in the circles of the politically connected few who have made a
fortune from the over 90 security contracts that the City has held valued at
R640 million.“My
approach to this matter, and any other that follows, is that I will subject
myself to any investigation that is required to protect the image of our City,”
he said.Mashaba
also said that he informed the Council Speaker that he decided to waive his
rights to this matter being treated confidentially.He also
called on political leaders with nothing to hide to step forward and be fully
accountable to their residents.
