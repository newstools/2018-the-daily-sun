A PICTURE is worth a thousand words, and for Mthokozisi Dlamini it’s also his bread and butter. Mthokozisi has made a name for himself taking party snaps at the popular Eyadini Lounge in Umlazi, south of Durban. He secretly takes photos of partygoers having a good time and posts them to Facebook. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvjgm8_Amgnvzd-BA7klqdzzgii75HdL9fquTBMXbDCxO-KagDKGjVbkPNAu5mmvhgue3u7NTn5B8-70HQ9oA2K2pqlzwUOpMXcLQWMgQuceDuTUhXRKRfohK8_GECMjXDfKLhWteAEEoITcD_VljUrR6KjFpVrZ56kFsA-SrvQBXi6jf36n4HdEUNnMVeOL1Hcyf-7yFD_cWFFT9uwbdcpX5n1pSIGfy7FVRKh4rmVgovys1UXZq2MO9CGufA4K4cwzyys9mP3qpK3ke_E-6StCo0Ya0o\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPOEmxbdvXv7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The 30-year-old said he started taking pictures after experienced photographer Muzi Kheswa showed him the ropes. “In 2013, I started posting my photos to Facebook. People loved our pictures, and thanks to them our page now has a large following,” he said. “As soon as I’ve taken a picture, I post it to Facebook. Most people are surprised to see themselves on the page because they don’t even realise I’m photographing them.”Mthokozisi, who is originally from Eshowe, said he feeds his two kids and family of 10 with the money he earns. “I’m the only one who puts bread on the table at home,” he said. He said he loves his job because his boss Mjay Nzama, the Eyadini owner, treats his employees like family.
