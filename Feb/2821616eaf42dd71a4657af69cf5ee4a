Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources is outraged that 955 miners were trapped underground from Wednesday until Friday morning, just because a storm knocked out power supplies."It is utterly unacceptable that an underground mine, whose operation takes place under the light of a bulb, could attribute its failure to bringing workers on the surface to [a] power outage. This goes to demonstrate the attitude of management towards safety," committee chairperson Sahlulele Luzipo said.Luzipo said a caring management would have foreseen such an event, and devised a back-up plan.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsva95oxrIxUuLe9dyvfAWdhFxUFU58_U-PZulipESpNYyLkdXSvtouSbh1nIAChTkT1pi6VKBoH19i8jKAuFiKSeqtAIxS8K5-_D9vyKC6Y7Giw8Ue32c_3tI-WFS4G05JS7SqhatD6u3bKkXgPvxr04kHM5KFVamVRDVQDcP_N7BDD-8Gy-o_-Tmd43UGPomCRHCKt2DBBGzLTxfDYSFM5D3ZNm5xeESoYIpj71xC9bxXSeD21Al_ifU8bEyFmh6Qih44Uc31V3i-dKk36XRNdf9AinVk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLYhMUQQTzgREAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
