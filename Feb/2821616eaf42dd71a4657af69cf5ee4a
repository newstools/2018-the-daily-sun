Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources is outraged that 955 miners were trapped underground from Wednesday until Friday morning, just because a storm knocked out power supplies."It is utterly unacceptable that an underground mine, whose operation takes place under the light of a bulb, could attribute its failure to bringing workers on the surface to [a] power outage. This goes to demonstrate the attitude of management towards safety," committee chairperson Sahlulele Luzipo said.Luzipo said a caring management would have foreseen such an event, and devised a back-up plan.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssy55tcMm0bVlhzpqXznkbAWgaml2EO7NNSBGY-0pjbuKSdHImdcyxh3PBmQ3bVtnR2BYeP-T1GOdHxvM258Ln_FkYN3JH-7ZFVHyfYI6IovyQTPUxA3r-bz_KyP-iwdIn0gmKCZEuhHB6OINFhEccEauk6IyAhc26KAvtjU17v-eaH4mzxpmxSADTn2A2CRcVsTB0ihq4BmdcIqmxSfxXRyA9QDLPcfQVQOMoxcNJv9C5ApmMLpgKbKYqFS2yyPUHay1W4wuWvqLbq88Vh8Cz19T8lvMU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDyx_DU9Qw22EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
