Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources is outraged that 955 miners were trapped underground from Wednesday until Friday morning, just because a storm knocked out power supplies."It is utterly unacceptable that an underground mine, whose operation takes place under the light of a bulb, could attribute its failure to bringing workers on the surface to [a] power outage. This goes to demonstrate the attitude of management towards safety," committee chairperson Sahlulele Luzipo said.Luzipo said a caring management would have foreseen such an event, and devised a back-up plan.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvq3FdE-H-SynzHKw_y4rVgqYPMTcK2EGlfmVOpwn_HH4wQD3Fci6E9Gv8WCiqrhDR6ZAjC_9PX7vrgyj3EpGH3p5nJP_uoFj6rBXxlMYBMxpzIgJQbkzkEzo-NBfBzK73aG890Op_-TUub4e4avyFeF0kD01nU44e81Muvohem24oyrw6oKJ0JzdEydfr835d5b-2-J32Jga6ZalHSEbQH9Kc2_GtuHTwMzYo1Y_G9Gn23Ju6NnO7ws5Z2g3en1CMepBrbf_Rp72-Fkutkc-Y9HuL__L0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCdLKw-PdPkIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
