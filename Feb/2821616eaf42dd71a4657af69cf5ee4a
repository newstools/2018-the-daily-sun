Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources is outraged that 955 miners were trapped underground from Wednesday until Friday morning, just because a storm knocked out power supplies."It is utterly unacceptable that an underground mine, whose operation takes place under the light of a bulb, could attribute its failure to bringing workers on the surface to [a] power outage. This goes to demonstrate the attitude of management towards safety," committee chairperson Sahlulele Luzipo said.Luzipo said a caring management would have foreseen such an event, and devised a back-up plan.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsshPhZt5zSeFwKQgdH58DVIsRVf8HxXX2rIJ5Zkdj45IzDguyAFR6kza6BiULEB7NmgzXn0r0OdeiYZdI0gRexohQ0Ue8YKwsbXBABp6KXm-Zqzul17CS0QhVAhihjsMUl7ITlXgqyx7frQZxUuLJew93XWCiMJ9zybRWyDJp01QI6SBeV5sqIqlbcX05x9c1L7eE2yniEVc4vpZhsL--LRjGN2xCPbXD7fsjz478Fji8Nn24L-I0nYR9eKBdRjSKCq14SJxq5ur2NEY_uEwIVYpb0Spwk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPeY5MQWLR6kEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
