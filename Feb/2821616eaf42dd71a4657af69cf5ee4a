Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources is outraged that 955 miners were trapped underground from Wednesday until Friday morning, just because a storm knocked out power supplies."It is utterly unacceptable that an underground mine, whose operation takes place under the light of a bulb, could attribute its failure to bringing workers on the surface to [a] power outage. This goes to demonstrate the attitude of management towards safety," committee chairperson Sahlulele Luzipo said.Luzipo said a caring management would have foreseen such an event, and devised a back-up plan.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvlf4WaAKvBJYfUkrYjCWhW-X91ctWVIottbOtLtpdGxzBDD_0xEangsmirp0aa3W_xMxe3fK87GjFfqw0GB2IF-Yakf-q5TamE7PVBEi1JLV4fkP-prK1rQPwpHafEBph7LggVDjqJLjBQDVPIHNeDQ8CavDW46ia8TV7weLPOMVL3dDdeNZOrF_TxGsnBR9iM-L6cblqdfD0T6HnvCQat3LQ_-KEjGd9wk4fpF_YwzUPmA92wW-B7_7KSVI3jlE8UakS27sTucMPlkDbQBWbLSHTedQg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJH1s2E3XZnlEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
