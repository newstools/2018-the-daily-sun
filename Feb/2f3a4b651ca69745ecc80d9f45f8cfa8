The time will come when I am ready to share, but for now, let's just say 2018 is going to be an eventful year for me,” she said."It's always been my dream to have a baby because I think I am ready for it. I'm calmer and every opportunity that's happening right now in my life is because I'm so peaceful. I'm so ready for it," she continued.Eternal Moments with My #Unstoppapbe team for the new ponds age miracle @ponds_sa #pondsxthembiA post shared by  Thembi Seete (@thembiseete_) on Feb 21, 2018 at 10:18am PSTExcitement, nervousness and the start of something new captured in moment. shared my #unstoppable TRUTH about who I am and where I come from, at the @ponds_sa age miracle launch ????????A post shared by  Thembi Seete (@thembiseete_) on Feb 19, 2018 at 11:51am PSTAs I reflect on one of, if not, the best moments of my life. I can not help but express my deepest gratitude to everybody who filled up that room with their love, power, support and positive energy. I was reminded once again how it felt to be in the presence of authentically joyful, exuberant and warm spirits. I learned a new meaning of love, I've never experienced such a thing What a heartwarming moment it was for me to receive My TIME in the presence of women I've always looked up to and admired growing up. I am still heavily inspired by these women. Women who have built their empires and still continue to break barriers in their respective fields. I'm deeply grateful to share this moment with each and every one of you. It's funny how I've watched people succeed, receive, and become the face of something credible and all I could say was " God when is my turn, when am I going to get it"you know But... One thing that I took from Thursday’s launch is that, when God shows up ,He shows off on time. I felt like God was saying "You've been asking for it and now I'm giving it to you" "allow me to lead you.I've been waiting for you to grow, to appreciate yourself and be more content." I tear up thinking of this moment because I've waited for so long Yes it hasn't been the easiest journey, but man, I appreciate every step of the way. The timing is perfect and nobody can take it from me. As I embark on a new journey with @ponds_sa I just want to say here's to #Unstoppable lessons, #Unstoppable memories and #Unstoppable growth. @nhlanhla_nciza @terrypheto @basetsanakumalo @azania_ @sureshnierider @ponds_sa @thee_sonia @theemrswillis @ayandathabethe_ @zuraidajardine @mbali_nks @sharonkhuzwayo @sphe_mjadu @trevor_stuurman @cedrictn @kavisha_vather @theemrswillis thank you so much ?????????for the love and support @ponds_sa ???? #Dakalo??A post shared by  Thembi Seete (@thembiseete_) on Feb 17, 2018 at 5:33am PSTTo the @ponds_sa #Unstoppable Ladies @basetsanakumalo @thee_sonia @zuraidajardine @azania_ @sureshnierider @theemrswillis @devashni_ganess ??????????. We might not get a chance to meet all the time but I truly appreciate all of you. God has put together all my teachers, my guardians, my sisters and friends. He has put the most amazing team to walk this journey with me. It is rare to be teamed up with such power and poise. I look forward to working alongside each of you and I can not wait to store up every lesson I can. Ladies, thank you once again. We are the team that will change the narrative around beauty. We will guide our women in becoming unapologetically themselves and embrace their #Unstoppable spirits and beauty. This is a love that comes with no question and no expectations but just pure authenticity. I love and appreciate you all.
