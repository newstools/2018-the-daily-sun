Writer, activist and Nelson Mandelaâ€™s granddaughter, Zoleka Mandela, has been living life to the fullest in Kuala Lumpur.The 37 year old motivational speaker and two time breast cancer survivor, flew off to the capital of Malaysia a few days ago after she was invited to speak at the World Urban Forum.When she caught a break from raising awareness about road safety in honour of her 13 year old daughter who tragically lost her life in a car accident in 2010, Zoleka took the time to enjoy exotic sights and food that Kuala Lumpur had to offer.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Have a look at what she got up to:I didn't feel like stretching after my online workout and now my body is sore!!! ?? Found a kickboxing workout that helped me burn 192 calories, I was doing so well at breakfast until I had 3 cups of tea with sugar! ?? Trying to lose weight whilst traveling is so difficult, it's not the booze in the minibar that bothers me ... It's all the candy, how do I not indulge? ?? I haven't helped myself to any of it (by it, I mean the potato chips, chocolate and sweets) but it's really starting to look like I'm about to have some by mistake!!! ?? #MrsBashalaInKualaLumpur #Malaysia #KualaLumpur #WeightLossJourney #65KgsByGraduation #WorkOutMotivation #HouseWifeOfNorthriding #FitbitCharge2A post shared by  Zoleka Mandela (@zolekamandela) on Feb 5, 2018 at 1:43am PSTBreakfast earlier at Lai Po Heen, a Vitality salad and 3 satays with peanut sauce after a 25mins Cardio Combo workout I found online ... Burned only 229 calories! ?? I didn't have the sweets and chocolate from the mini bar YESTERDAY but everything went downhill after I had their potato chips, I had a whole Malaysian Pretzel hot dog/Pretzel sausage and felt really guilty which had me working out again before bed! ?? #HouseWifeOfNorthriding #65KgsByGraduation #WeightLossJourney #WorkOutMotivation #Malaysia #MrsBashalaInKualaLumpur #KualaLumpur #FitbitCharge2A post shared by  Zoleka Mandela (@zolekamandela) on Feb 5, 2018 at 8:54pm PSTThere I was minding my own business when we discovered a fleet of Food trucks just outside the hotel we're staying in. The plan was to go the convention center to sort out my accreditation for tomorrow's conference NOT to EAT this! ?? Guys, how many calories are there in 3 CHURROS and the caramel sauce I dipped them in? ?? I may as well have just eaten a cup of sugar instead and washed it down with oil because it's literally the same thing!!! I'll have to work out again after going over my speech for the millionth time, my nerves ... ?? #MrsBashalaInKualaLumpur #Malaysia #KualaLumpur #UrbanStreetFood #ChurrosA post shared by  Zoleka Mandela (@zolekamandela) on Feb 6, 2018 at 1:18am PSTGraduation is on the 8th of March, please feel free to remind me when I struggle to lose the last few kilograms that I sabotaged my own diet? ?? Even if I convince you that the food in Kuala Lumpur hates me so much, it won't leave me alone and keeps bullying me to the point that I have to take matters into my own mouth NOT hands!!! ?? This was dinner ... MO Curry Laska - Coconut broth, yellow noodles, chicken, tofu and shrimp ... #MrsBashalaInKualaLumpur #Malaysia #KualaLumpur #MoCurryLaska #MalaysianCuisineA post shared by  Zoleka Mandela (@zolekamandela) on Feb 6, 2018 at 4:00am PSTThis was 4hrs ago, on route to the World Urban Forum! I meant to post this earlier but my focus was on my speech that I had to deliver! ?? Here's one for now, I'll bombard you guys with more once I reach my hotel suite, clear my phone memory, grab my selfie stick and have a mini photo shoot just for the Gram!!! ?? #ProudCongoleseWife #WifeOfAnAfricanMan #MwasiYaThierry #MrsBashala #MakotiKaThierry #37YrOldMotherOf4 #MrsBashalaInKualaLumpur #Malaysia #KualaLumpur #AfricanChic #HouseWifeOfNorthridingA post shared by  Zoleka Mandela (@zolekamandela) on Feb 6, 2018 at 8:37pm PSTLast minute shopping at the flea market in Petaling, this was so awesome but minus the vendors yelling out, "Hakuna Matata," trying to get me to buy something from their stalls! They should actually just ask Pumba and Timon! ?? I loved walking the streets of Petaling, bought some gorgeous fabric I may just use for my graduation outfit! ?? Literally counting down the hours until I'm in My Day One's arms!!! ?? #MrsBashalaInKualaLumpur #Malaysia #KualaLumpur #PetalingStreet #FleaMarket #Sayangi #StreetShoppingA post shared by  Zoleka Mandela (@zolekamandela) on Feb 10, 2018 at 10:46pm PST
