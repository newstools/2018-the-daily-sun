The owner of the centre was not there.The security gates were locked, but the doors were not.The man was on the floor and he had soiled himself. His nappy appeared not to have been changed for a while.The room was filthy and filled with flies. On seeing the team the man made signs of appeal for something to eat.Daily Sun informed the cops and Ekurhuleni Emergency Services, but the woman arrived before the paramedics and rushed in to remove the man from the room.She refused to release the patient to paramedics when asked. She told the SunTeam she was sorry that the patients were left alone. She said she would explain later.

She does not care about them,” said one resident.
