AYANDA Patosi will need to pull up his socks to warrant a place in Benni McCarthy’s starting lineup.The Cape Town City coach was disappointed when the winger failed to live up to expectations in their Nedbank Cup Last 32 match against Bidvest Wits in Milpark on Wednesday.  The no-nonsense McCarthy replaced Patosi in the first half as the Citizens went on to beat Wits 1-0 to increase their chances of winning their second trophy since the club was founded in 2016. City won the Telkom Knockout under the guidance of Eric Tinkler in December 2016.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Said McCarthy: “Patosi is the one that should be making us click and he was giving balls away. The wet and heavy pitch, wet shirt, it was all mounting. He wasn’t giving me what I expected from him and I thought I should change him before we go level.”Added McCarthy: “I was looking for ideas on how to get a second goal. I brought Craig Martin on to give us pace and because he wouldn’t be scared to play.” McCarthy stressed that Patosi would need to be on par with the rest of the squad to get another chance to play.“We needed players with character, fighters. There is no room for luxury players. I think Patosi was a luxury player for me today. “We needed fighters and Craig, as skinny and slight as he is, is probably one of the players with the biggest hearts. Thabo Nodada is sorely missed – that is his position – but unfortunately he has a massive cyst under his eye, so you can’t take the risk.”McCarthy revealed that Patosi was not happy about being replaced early in the game.“We exchanged words but it’s normal. I probably would have knocked my head against the wall if I played like shit. If I know I deserve to come off after 20 minutes, I can’t fight the coach or teammates. “If you are a good professional, and you know your ability and the level of play you should maintain, and you are not giving that, you can’t really fight. “And if a fight is what you want, then good luck.” Like this story?
