It hurts us to see his friends go to school. I don’t know why the department doesn’t attend to our problem,” said Nonhlanhla.Sibongiseni Dlangamandla (43) said they hoped that by reporting the incident to the department quickly, it would help get the school fixed quickly, or that mobile classrooms would be provided.“Maybe the department doesn’t consider primary school matters a priority.” KZN Education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said they were dealing with the matter. “We are still communicating with the local municipality.”
