His accomplices who fled are unknown,” he said.Provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba condemned the continuous acts vigilantism and killings which were still prevalent in some policing clusters in Limpopo, and singled out the Tubatse policing area outside Burgersfort.“Community members are warned and cautioned to refrain and stop this unbearable behaviour because it continues to destroy the spirit of Community Policing,” said Ledwaba.Ledwana said vigilantism could not be tolerated and that those involved would be dealt with “mercilessly and without compromise.”Ngoepe said a case of murder and two counts of malicious damage to property had been opened, but no arrests had been made.He said anyone with information which could lead to the arrest of those involved in the vigilante attack, should contact the Crime Stop Number 08600 10111, the Crime Line SMS 32211 or their nearest police station.SOURCE:News24
