The presidency has issued a statement saying president Jacob Zuma has not called a media briefing for Wednesday as reported. "The media is advised that no official communication has been issued by the Presidency on a media briefing today by President Jacob Zuma as reported by media houses," said Zuma spokesman Dr Bongani Ngqulunga.This is despite the existence of a clear communication showing that the presidency had indeed called a media briefing for 10:00 on Wednesday at the Union Building Media Centre in Pretoria.    if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssa0OeUUA8ZHqELjP4RwwAX0alT-4R-yRrj7P1dzu_tgV90MHtGyrKc4wfWx44yG0cQII5437DCUPfA2SBKaPm4Qsl-XIINGfkSPi00hs4k1cz4q_ElAB2M9m-7i9dDYkpnItOsGMM-83_x4EObiHvSnUf2s59OuFRYOUFyyh5_YK95bO3VZpu-oHpN2vZpz9H9ZeJXZlVXzRWdx10BXJOYJBA4H_7qO6bBfvcv0oqe0dczr8p5-ZPtdJKH0l06qbV_Ztr-i-A5wx_CexprnnCqQBnlGNc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzANUDsyKYPn0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
