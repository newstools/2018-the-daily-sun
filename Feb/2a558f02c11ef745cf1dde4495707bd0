On Monday morning, he said on Twitter: “Today someone will tell you they love you. “Tomorrow they can act like you don’t even exist.”But social media users responded with laughter instead of comforting him.Even though Bonang has had no trouble moving on, it’s clear AKA is taking the breakup much harder than his ex. The One Time hitmaker has been talking about their split in interviews. Over a week ago, he opened up about how he regretted the way things turned out between him and DJ Zinhle, his baby mama.The rapper made the confession during an intimate interview on Real Talk with Anele. He said: “Zinhle is a strong woman and a great mother. At the time, I was too young and stupid to realise that.”
