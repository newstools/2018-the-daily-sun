VILLAGERS are too scared to go near this tree. They claim it is cursed. The tree, which has bits of cloths in different colours tied to it, is blamed for casting a dark cloud over Makahlule Village in Limpopo. The tree was discovered by Elvis Chauke and Magezi Khosa in the middle of the bush on Sunday afternoon. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuL0IMT2iDUSIHUzCe9yKKeEUIu6Pdy_EByop0Fhs6Em50GxMp3w67WPZdbgfxYMIf4ONnVWPqDMq3X9qUPq1piW8zmmBQmGAhfkGW_tA11qyEdGpTKb22w6W12LIuSUMzj60uLb_E38L7KzDeWR3PwTUlGAXf_3D3L2vKdGkQxCuUeUrPOtNyumytoXiedeSVhoQScUZKxBHffQdiWSOss3IqzyWJQFjyE1hMxv0AvsY91pCAt9oLbT0Grg9EaD6RCvOcJiHWxeBrr3RzjPRb7hmCPFAs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDRinRHdmEqTEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

As we got closer to investigate, we felt as if we were being absorbed by a spirit.” He said after about five to ten minutes they came to their senses and ran back to the village to call others. “We wanted them to witness what we had seen. But they refused to come near the tree. They said they feared they would go mad. Now, my friend and I fear for our lives,” said Magezi.His friend Elvis said he suspected deaths that took place in the village last year were caused by the tree. He said: “Since August people in our village have been dying almost every week. We bury two or three people in one week. I suspect the tree caused it. We need help.”Elvis is appealing to a prophet or an inyanga to help them. “If not, we will all die soon.” Nwa-xithlangoma Chauke (65), a traditional healer, said: “Normally, evil inyangas and prophets put pieces of cloths with muthi on a tree to cast a bad spell or kill innocent people. The villagers must find a strong inyanga to remove the muthi from the tree and burn it.”
