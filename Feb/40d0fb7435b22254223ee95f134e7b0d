LAWRENCE Dube and Sithenjwa Nyawose, known backers of Cyril Ramaphosa, have expressed shock at talk of a hero’s welcome for former president Jacob Zuma.The two councillors have warned that such celebrations will further divide the organisation in KZN and jeopardise attempts to unite the party in the province. “We don’t understand where that idea came from. It’s not understandable that someone is fired from a job because he has done something wrong but when he comes home he receives a hero’s welcome,” said Dube.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssmCKDColTECWVxqNWNpn2ZC04IGRTspeXIJEem5QaOWrrUnaZOixV1DIINbxo8xkhaEP3YgUI7r-jDSOIxEzX6fDMq_nSnZMywhGs6jgnMoBkHQo3wO-xfd3Oz00ito-5EkdtrDIRvtLsx0qSOacYLkynU8PjXuwDkF5N722Qv_8RblFysdvIQQiB85RpRYmlxUhFLN1NganwdjmEhAecvi5UGOYIUcaVgUkeAxpxt9RwCl5fC2e96eH-XFFc44becNos2jKZKP4csTS_R9jMbZ61GwpM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzO_PdrZX6hsqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Zikalala said Zuma was a true example of a disciplined member of the party although he had defied the party’s decision for him to step down. On Thursday Zikalala said the party was organising celebration rallies for Zuma to thank him for his contribution to South Africa. Attempts to get Zikalala’s comment failed. Provincial secretary Super Zuma said they had the right to organise welcome celebrations as provincial leaders plan their party programmes without permission from national structures.
