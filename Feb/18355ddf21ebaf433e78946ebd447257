PLANS for their Premiership return are set to begin in earnest for Highlands Park.Little doubt now remains that they are on their way back to the PSL gravy train after crushing Jomo Cosmos 4-0 in their National First Division fixture at Vosloorus Stadium yesterday.With nine games to go, they look safe bets for automatic promotion back whence they come.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsthiCPCJ7DXyqOHEe9vSaxQE8fwlQHuJluVvXb9SHErK41J2wFgYMrq8To4YFKCZ_YhmfG7qNA9SyOtUPgaFtVdYJ7QyMR6iHDzJ08mL7eYN1VXTZJq5DlwHL9uwvNGulwPlU_hxgkZ1kWSnc7MDFpbAhhBhK8rclmD1srpD1C_MEbbClR_LIYae5qh2p4kMRTq9ZhpRlXTlAbe_I6QP-7RSIrSpSBJ6QYpE3-4G3PJc0HJuluwWjrc_1cqoV7ls1j8m9TFBxDADt9UfbwC\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOibhQQp8ZIyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Their record now reads: win 11, draw five, lose three.That’s a good sign for a team chasing automatic promotion into the elite PSL, though Highlands wouldn’t dare count their chickens before they hatch.Man of the match Mvala scored a contender for goal of the season with a trademark scorcher from just outside, minutes after the half-hour mark.Five minutes later, Shalulile rose highest inside the box to head in the second and put the visitors firmly in control.Highlands kept up the tempo in the second half and it wasn’t long before Mahlangu ended the game as a contest, guiding Shalulile’s cross into the net for Highlands’ third goal.Shembe got in on the act as he rammed in the fourth.A crestfallen Jomo Sono sat expressionless in his seat, the Cosmos coach no doubt hoping it would all end.In truth, he didn’t sound optimistic of victory ahead of the game, somehow lamenting his own decision to sell key players Linda Mbambo, Mxolisi Macuphu to Premiership side Chippa United.Nkanyiso Zungu could have got grabbed a consolation goal had he found the net from a rare opportunity. But Ezenkosi were simply torn apart, porous at the back, slow in the middle and blunt upfront. They’ll have to improve if they hope for a play-off spot.
