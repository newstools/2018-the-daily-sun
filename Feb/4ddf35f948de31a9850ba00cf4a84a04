The matter was reported to the local police and with the assistance of the media and community they were located.The Hawks’ Trafficking in Persons Task Team (TIPTT) took over investigation which led to arrest of Matini and Mboya. Further investigations led the team to six other human trafficking victims.All the eight victims were seduced with false promises of rewarding jobs.  Instead, the girls aged between 21 and 22 years old were exploited and sexually abused by the men who were working at the race course.  The men would pay Mantini cash and groceries to forcefully sleep with the kidnapped girls. It was established during the probe that Mantini’s illegal operation dates back to 2008.“I want to sincerely congratulate the team, the prosecutors and the judiciary for the work that they put in making sure that the architect of this shocking crime is removed from the community completely.  It is an affirmation of how close collaboration between law enforcement agencies can be very effective in combating violations of human rights.“The conviction should serve as a warning to all human traffickers that as the Hawks we are committed to bringing to justice all those who take advantage of our women and children, no matter who they are.  We are also grateful by the greater vigilance among our communities and media partners to enable criminal prosecutions with a strong view to prevent and punish such abuses,” she concluded.
