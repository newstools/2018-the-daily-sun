We don’t want to be provoked by those in power. “This is a very thorny issue. Our people deserve better,” said the king.He also told Maimane about some of the challenges faced by people living in the villages of Zululand.“Our people are sharing dirty river water with cattle,” he said.The king said he was grateful the DA had visited his palace for the first time since the party was formed.“You are in the right place. Your visit to my place is such an honour,” he said.Maimane thanked the king for welcoming him with open arms and described the visit as a privilege.He said he was going to talk to the board about the land issue.“We must make decisions that will give justice to our fellow South Africans,” he said.Maimane presented the king with five cows and a shield.In return, the king gave him cattle and a traditional headpiece called umqhele.
