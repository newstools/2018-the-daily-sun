WHEN Claudine and Charles Phillips got married, they vowed to stay together for better or worse. And 10 years later, the two have proven that they really meant it. Claudine (33) and Charles (39) have been going through the worst time of their lives and have been forced to live in an old Jetta in Eldorado Park, south of Joburg. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>They told Daily Sun they have been living in the car for a year. “We used to live in Randfontein with my family but because of family problems, we had to leave,” said Charles. He said they moved to Eldorado Park because they had friends there. “Our friends didn’t have an extra room for us so we came up with this plan because we weren’t able to go back to Randfontein.”Charles said they asked to park the car in a yard full of shacks, which the owner agreed to. He said it is very difficult to live in the car. “My wife has a medical condition which makes her unable to work. I’ve been looking for a job with no success,” he said.The couple said thanks to the local NGO, the Local Development and Economic Civil Association, they are able to bath and use the toilet during the day. “But when it’s late and one of us needs the toilet, we have to relieve ourselves in the veld,” said Charles. He said he bought the car, which is now their home, 15 years ago when he was working as a security guard. “I lost that job after we got married. Since then things have been difficult for us.” The couple said any help from SunReaders, especially a place to stay, would be very much appreciated.
