It should be ashamed.”Another parent Buziwe Dlangamandla (48) said the department ignored them because they lived in a village.“Villages don’t get prioritised in terms of service delivery. But that is wrong,” said Buziwe.SGB chairman Khulekani Shezi said most desks were old and broken. “Windows and doors are also broken, which causes pupils to suffer in winter,” said Shezi.The principal referred Daily Sun to the department.KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said they were aware of the situation.“Some residents vandalised the school, which is why it has broken windows and desks. “We’re still dealing with other schools’ problems. “We’ll fix this school when we are done.”
