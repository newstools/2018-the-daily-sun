Police spokesman Captain Eddie Boboko said the trouble started when two gangs, the Vandals and the Deltas, got into a fight at the Chesa by Night club in Carletonville, Gauteng, on Saturday night. “When police arrived, security at the venue had managed to get one group to go outside but the others followed and the fighting continued,” he said. “The gangs started to throw stones, bottles and sticks at the police. The cops responded by firing rubber bullets.” Boboko said an injured member of the Deltas was then taken to Carletonville Hospital by a group of 15 men. “But they were followed by about 18 members of the Vandals, who entered the hospital and started to attack the Deltas. “During the fight, two of the Delta members were stabbed. When the police arrived, men were seen leaving the hospital,” he said. “Cops went inside and found only members of the Delta gang. Doctors and nurses had fled.” Boboko said two members of the Vandals, aged in their twenties, were charged with attempted murder while the other suspects were still at large. He asked anyone with information to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
