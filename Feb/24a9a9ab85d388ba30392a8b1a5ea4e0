A truck driver jumped out of a moving truck after the brakes stopped working.  It is alleged the truck driver jumped out of the truck when he realised the truck breaks weren't functioning anymore, which led to a multiple car crash in Durban road, in Bellville Cape Town. The truck then drove into over seven cars before crashing into a Hyundai dealership.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvyb9uNAsvXmHieQUYuNI_pwtKcgKLY9XldOAeH6r7XuyQzIe9R-KV9-jc22-wk0U5k2GqbnYM4Lh7RWOnLRhwQu-1r8dfBBvkYWcKk1TZnFJwcecI9rl9UPAqL2AVaEdyVYwZLX4Sok4WQAXp0593P5RJhzAp4DXTwOE1_XZMKS2WdYjoJrdZskyayeUSjGDCaZLTYqdCPwizZ4Wkn-K7KaUf9WdE4zWo1Jy2mx8-h7yhdjsezOi_s6smNSrccjzqVLaI7tbOAuKJz0wP2E9zaES5gP04\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzN3JzF88rgQbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
