A truck driver jumped out of a moving truck after the brakes stopped working.  It is alleged the truck driver jumped out of the truck when he realised the truck breaks weren't functioning anymore, which led to a multiple car crash in Durban road, in Bellville Cape Town. The truck then drove into over seven cars before crashing into a Hyundai dealership.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssO8DtIX9A0WivEsqxWCKrt_RuqL5jvP4Pk_bpHR8UIIAfTrVvO6j7Ul62O8eD05dWAaVht0CLFaDJArw7LnoEtpN69LQ8XEehN42nmCbWPcZA-RBBp17WuTme5CHC6gGehiFqK4qsMoaYu-fXt2I0xAIUVDvHZOrAYrVzE1mbQZX7YJqksakn8s2TdNcOoZwCfwfMfXiG7YIO5xMPq4BaBKrO_GGq7f2QilOpPrqp90coZxmGQPW2ublXZ6lSOH4HxCpmuQcNH_qJhHXrHGgIzGBNGTp8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzH4jcsCiCnSPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
