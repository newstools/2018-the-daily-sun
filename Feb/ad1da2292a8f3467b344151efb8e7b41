testament to the organisation’s commitment to reaching the increased revenue
target of R 1.217-trillion which was announced in the Budget Speech.The Commissioner said he was confident that the SARS revenue
management structures and the entire staff in all regions of the country would
deliver the revenue needed by South Africa.“We are focused on closing all revenue leakages through
non-compliance and our staff will spare no effort in reaching the revenue
target by 29 March, even though the economy is not performing to our
expectations,” Moyane said.“We believe that our efforts will provide government with
the requisite fiscal space to free up resources for its developmental objective"
