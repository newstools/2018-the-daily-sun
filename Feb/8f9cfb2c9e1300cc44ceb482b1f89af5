MPHO “Popps” Modikoane does not see things the same way as others.  “I have the ability to look at the same things society does but in a different way. “This allows me to find humour in any situation,” said the 31-year-old comedian from Meadowlands, Soweto.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu-PztfyXU6rFDywxgqhgfcaMipoIZ9JbSErlfz0k6lIlrd-9KHr-0Ph4nsCvarYe03_6BrB3rcTAPnd7eIAqTWzIXCdp7l7d1afWjuS3H15k7DAkLK91TuZrD8b22wDXpk_RzmpGe2lt9yRQJj9ueG6S8ixbO7RvnGZoH7CEJjj9f6NLzMaBwS0cNOHsEgrabI6jsb_7hxxRBf1MIF7M-TI_6sae0O7mNx_M4y730xvJ0QqlHXts5Hcu0S5VyRCXBJy1j8wKWbLDdkAx8DKwth3T-5U2o\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKxEI3xkDp0jEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

In 2005, he won the most promising actor award while a pupil at Mondeor High School in Gauteng. He was nominated in the Best Newcomer category at the 2011 South African Comic’s Choice Awards and the Breakthrough Act category the following year.Thinasobabile, a film he produced and starred in, won the Joburg International Film Festival Audience Choice Award in 2015. He also won the same award at the Pan African Festival in Los Angeles, United States.Mpho said he teases the people who sit in the front row to make them feel they are part of the show.“I try to reach inside the individual’s soul to give joy and happiness.” His daughter Imani (6), is his number one fan. She wants to be like her father when she grows up. Mpho said he wishes comedians would work with writers for the sake of the industry’s growth.
