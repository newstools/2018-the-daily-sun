Dust fills the air while the gangsters spin their cars and drink as much booze as they are able to. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuH7rO01Z_pQPnaFzcBeX-zUdACK-GVLl81jturA9WHSgAWOuD36PtoGFWOomVERvHkpR2rJPnYcJsQDKwU5MiV_dS973WCjy64_U6gg3iHJROWILvK4-0CYS2tteDz-qk77pU3TamX_BlXZ2VXYovRh5AaM1cozIYT_DyJ9wU-6RlIi24hFN9EFPg9V4npC5p45jtuWhhvexSz77QJzuHN_G0c3wONxLvCvtS459fKQZYXdE55MQ3KZoGdS62kr7SqNbCSWZItUqzkhBc8-6O_Y5nx7w0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMk_X5QyfcfnEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Tonjeni said police learned during the launch of Operation Fiela 2 that a number of gangsters would be buried last weekend. “Police officers were deployed to graveyards and popular funeral service venues,” he said.Eastern Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga instructed officers to arrest anyone who disturbed the peace at graveyards.“We were in Port Elizabeth to launch Operation Fiela 2 when we heard that criminals were trying to hijack cars. “Some went to a VW plant to steal seven cars, but police managed to recover some of the stolen vehicles‚” said Ntshinga.“Police were also deployed to funeral service venues to protect the public. “We will reclaim every space and sweep this province clean with the assistance of Operation Fiela 2.” Ntshinga urged residents to come forward with information that could help the police make arrests.
