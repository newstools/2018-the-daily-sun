Zimbabwe's former leader Robert Mugabe is celebrating his
first birthday since his resignation in near solitude, far from the lavish
affair of years gone by.The government that removed him with military assistance in
November has declared February 21, Mugabe's birthday, a national holiday.But there are no signs of past celebrations, no giant cakes
or thousands of supporters wearing clothing with Mugabe's image, no live state
television broadcasts.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssY9ynPGtUWQdp_c59AbI_KXJ7I6F8vX5W9F_DGAv2PJTgrXV15jfTjMz3iVcNC-YDYyq5MwmaYOLo7n0nvYqvsYHI0tPKMeSwE8qi6oQCwZa3h7aHh0lyNO8I3VKYeNOjNDTHGw7DH_OnbZJsag65XTo9SRiYYBkqIQpzpxz9vcJYg_onYCKf4cUN7zLuWb8GxuPOh0s5ldMV-NPONBEjM0yRaCmhwxMeD3mwYYz9-8C5wx5Jp1eCOcsje_Fju1uAAgXizJgSQMSkYvlIXrEVZWkECMi6iybhZ8w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMpLDHE1qpdgEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

made public appearances. He skipped the funeral Tuesday of opposition leader
and former Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, sending written condolences
instead.Former cabinet minister Jonathan Moyo is sharing photos on
Twitter of a severe-looking Mugabe in a suit sitting next to his wife, Grace,
in what resembles an official portrait.
