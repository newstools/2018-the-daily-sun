THE South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) will not be sending athletes to the 2018 Commonwealth Games in “baggy tracksuits”.And most importantly, the local athletes will be fairly remunerated for their efforts in Australia, says Sascoc president Gideon Sam.Top athletes such as Olympic gold medallist Luvo Manyonga and World Championships silver medallist Anaso Jobodwana paraded the new kit by technical sponsors  Lotto in Midrand yesterday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstLCX-7LSOh7pnZG-bSR7tdxtp37y27jqavORp9kTpS9h-fx9CZ6WblzCMqzb32bgy9JKGuLtSQ0yi4xS67CJ-20QCBiiUJCHR92n91kAoN_sVlIr0J2l9Oe122pvDS4o-0toRd48t6c3yl8Ieo4Zrv2-Ge2IuFna7WAW8qL9HWxfaNen22Q23NNg6BCeicK_64M7ZdFeUthtgeyGnUXtOijwmliKR9jwj9MXud0Ltfk-AxBrdG2v6Hoxbi5cITEYwtLzXtoBYexIT_8gyW\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzE2Ls833vP1VEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The CLR has also come on board with a special contribution of R5,3 million over and above what we will get during the course of the application phase, specifically for the Commonwealth Games. The Sport and Recreation Department will do the same. “We are bargaining on 15 gold medals. That is the total budget of Sascoc. “We also get money from the IOC, the Olympic Solidarity and the Commonwealth Federation, and out of that we will put away R1,7 million for incentives.”Sam added that they were looking to up their position on the medals table.
