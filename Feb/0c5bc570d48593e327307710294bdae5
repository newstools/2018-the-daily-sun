HIS house looked like a war zone. Mattresses were turned ­upside down, dishes scattered around and clothes thrown out of the wardrobe. Tebogo Maseame of section D6, Mamelodi West in Tshwane said this was the work of police. The 33-year-old told Daily Sun he was woken up by knocking on his doors and windows in the early hours of Monday morning. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvbJykuT77UQZUEZSj__EYyZ_R7MDo3ixd2rxmxZP2isOAcYs5Ik3U7vee8vwVeiDnfyWj57xrHgmLLbqjLM09gVGo1gRxGe4qI6SP3tDhDv6SbXTVMMs-SYjqa_XtLOgvNtzUUkqE9THYxw5_wn7i0zDMVEVLDpDO1lB-rAq3VGf0NYqlBTQl367JVQ6o4A4hxUXzFVfyqdfXLyEvNcTzyObhMSdS980FNe149sCKPJ5YYLLsu7dqJ10MNZSci7gE7Upn3uhCxibOXGw6jJOj3DphFYI8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDhM23NlpAH5EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

There were about 15 officers.”He said after he opened the door he was pushed aside as police searched his house. “I asked them what were they looking for and they told me to hand over the millions I’d stolen. “I thought I was dreaming. I have never held or touched R5 000 in my life – where on earth would I get millions?” asked Tebogo.He said he told the police he was a law student and didn’t know anything about missing millions. “They continued searching and breaking things. I waited for them to see if they would get the millions,” he said. “Then, while they were searching, one officer received a call and said the right house had been found. They left without saying anything. I expected at least an apology.” Tebogo said he went to the police to lay a charge but claimed he was turned away. Mamelodi East police spokesman Captain Michael Mbewe said Tebogo should come to the police station to lay a charge and explain to them what happened.
