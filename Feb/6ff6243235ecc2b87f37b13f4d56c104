Sihle Zikalala, the provincial interim committee co-ordinator, said the posters would be removed next month when the party launched its 2019 election campaign. “It’s not true that we kept the poster because we didn’t accepted Ramaphosa. We were the first people to print a big banner bearing Ramaphosa’s face as the ANC president when he visited the province last month,” said Zikalala.“Those who complain still suffer from the hangover of the conference, because they still wear T-shirts supporting Ramaphosa as if he was not yet elected.”
