Normally after taking a bath my mum goes to bed, but this time she wanted to watch TV. I had just switched on the TV when I heard a big bang.“The light fell on top of our home. All I could do was cover my mum. She was crying from shock and fear. I then heard people talking outside and pushing the door to rescue us. If the ceiling had fallen over us we would not have survived.”Eugene said they lost almost everything they owned. “Everything was destroyed and we now have to start all over. But I thank God that we are still alive and no one was hurt,” he said.Ward councillor Luyolo Nombola said officials from disaster management visited the family and gave them blankets and mattresses. “We warned the occupants to avoid the damaged rooms as stability is still uncertain. We have moved gogo to her relatives for her safety,” said Luyolo.“The section of the pole that’s lying on top of the house is extremely heavy. Municipal workers told us attempting to move it without the necessary equipment and expertise is likely to result in extensive damage.” Attempts to get comment from the municipality were fruitless. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki’s phone went to voicemail.
