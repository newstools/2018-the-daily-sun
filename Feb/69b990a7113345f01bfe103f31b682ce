The order can be stopped if you show the court good reasons.Types of warrants of executionThere is more than one way a creditor (someone who is owed money) can apply to get their money back:Warrant of execution against movable property – allows the sheriff to take moveable goods from the debtor, so they can be sold at an auction.The Section 65 proceedings and the emoluments attachment order – this is done by the magistrates court, so the court and the creditor can look at your finances.If you are employed, the court will probably grant an emoluments attachment order to tell your employer to pay instalments from your salary until your debt is paid off.Garnishee order – this looks at all your monies like investments and cash in the bank, to see how they can effectively be used to pay off your debt.Warrant of execution against unmovable property – this would only be considered if the three options above cannot be done.WHAT can Sipho do?If Sipho has a good reason, he can apply to the court to put the proceeding on hold for him to prove his case or have it removed.How can Scorpion help?Depending on Sipho’s policy cover, Scorpion can appoint an attorney to help him.You can strike back legally too!Click here to fill in your details for Scorpion to call you back.Terms and conditions apply.
