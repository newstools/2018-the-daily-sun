It’s not too early to be talking about a reshuffle.”He said Ramaphosa’s speech should be followed by a reshuffle.Pamla said the ministers who should go were Lynne Brown, Bathabile Dlamini, Des van Rooyen, Mosebenzi Zwane, Nomvula Mokonyane, Malusi Gigaba and David Mahlobo.In his State of the Nation address on Friday night, Ramaphosa said he would cut down on the bloated Cabinet. Currently the executive has more than 70 ministers and deputies.The SACP, however, said there was no rush and that a reshuffle had to be done in a way that united the movement and the alliance.SACP spokesman Alex Mashilo told Daily Sun: “When the reshuffle is implemented should depend on consultation with alliance partners. “You don’t need constant reshuffles. “You have to apply your mind thoroughly before any Cabinet changes. “We do not want to appoint the Cabinet via the media.”When asked about fears of a Cabinet reshuffle, Finance Minister Gigaba said he served at the pleasure of the president.Pamla warned that next year people will not automatically vote for the ANC.“Ramaphosa must not go around thinking that we’ll automatically vote for him.”
