government departments," Ramaphosa said.He addressed the issue of Mzansi's current expensive data

responsibility as government and MPs to give them the means to unlock that
potential."Meanwhile, he also touched on the Marikana Massacre, saying

in the life of our young democracy," Ramaphosa said.In wrapping up his speech, he thanked all the MPs who
participated in what he termed a robust and challenging SONA debate."I also want to thank the people of SA who responded to
the call that went out, a new dawn has indeed arrived in our country. There is
hard work ahead. What we should do, all of us, is stand up, and  say 'Thuma Mina', send me'."
