Daily Sun has learned that two suspects, aged 32 and 35, were bust in Gingindlovu, northern KZN on Tuesday and were due to appear in the Nyoni Magistrates Court soon. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “I don’t have much information about the case, but the men have been charged with murder.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstyEbA9U1Z2Yu-T-qde7S--uNFOVtDUiJPCFeR_21Z1ByZvma8GyWPAW6AZ8Gj4EX1BuKw_ixobX0JZmULKRXvwq072h0snzrSQTfXbEZ4lbkizCT0J4m5vJhuoXXNW13LNiUJubMVmwwbhDldJQviR3GcsG_add0A0Kt4Euce2bRJcvO7VueaWlXCcksMmQt63TzKB5SFrUwHXrdCDIjEyV4AIUVGDj4f-iUEx3Nn8BEGdpPBi_s2i5Ehde7upsc9-GmLFEKa4oNT7iyKRj-hvLbcDMoQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzN1XZfWuWKyWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Her cousin, Thembinkosi (37), said her cellphone was off when the family called her. “Senzeni’s fiance and her friends said they knew nothing about her whereabouts. We reported her missing to the cops two days after she disappeared,” said Thembinkosi. He told Daily Sun he lost all hope when he received the shocking news last week. “I was informed by cops that on the day Senzeni disappeared, a burned car was found with a body inside. At the scene, I saw tiny spots of blue paint on the ground,” he said. “It was the same colour as Senzeni’s Ford Fiesta. I knew she was dead when I saw it.”He said police took DNA samples on Friday to match with the burned body found in the car and the results were expected soon. “Although we have not heard about the arrest, we’re glad cops have made progress in the case,” he said.
