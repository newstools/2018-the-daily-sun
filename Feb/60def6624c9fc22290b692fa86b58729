MARITZBURG United hope to hang on to midfielder William Twala permanently, having signed him on loan from Kaizer Chiefs until the end of the current season.So talented is the 27-year-old player known as “Tsiki-Tsiki” that United chairman Farook Kadodia has already started considering finding him a permanent place with the Team of Choice.This he said just an hour after agreeing with Chiefs on the transfer heading to Pietermaritzburg on a short-term loan.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsso_2JnJ3RxZnFWw4kYzKd9vAiMwUBDNqS9nLCjixfQV3mY4r3ExxmjOcpKkiKaZ-RDO1mRcG7FuKC-KRt7EVoGiWgvOhtdKl9vfaOn8uVLYZvlLz50GcCpX49aExKgHHZQoelo1tgbVrmqRYhINqGkyw09oZT0vx-zVsnicgq0VCkjMp1y-9d8NJ3KpLKS9ubLh-Kz_xb_p5_K-CNV7YnUGK9HPenaZcyOubP_v5nNfUrDILZ5mOx2vf9Y6ibj6ykjUvD53W2VYcb3O2jmoTHwcQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIqeEXBNZyDIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He will stay with us until the end of the current season, and from there we will see. “Obviously our aim is to keep him longer on a permanent deal. However, that will depend on how he performs in the five months he will be with us. And also whether the coach (Fadlu Davids) is satisfied with his progress.” The midfielder joined Chiefs from Chippa United two seasons ago but failed to impress Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela. Since his arrival in Naturena the speedy winger has made only 19 starts.This season saw Twala drop out of the pack that saw him getting limited game-time. This lack of game-time at Chiefs could see him missing out on the Team of Choice’s clash with his former team, Orlando Pirates, at Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Saturday (8.15pm).Despite all of that, United were keen on landing the player, Kadodia saying that the club had long been admirers of Twala.He said: “He starts training with his new teammates this morning but first he will have to undergo medical check-ups. “We know he hasn’t played much this season at Chiefs, so we don’t know the level of his conditioning and whether he has injuries or not.” Twala joined the Team of Choice just a day after the club sold their star striker Evans Rusike, who has joined Mamelodi Sundowns forward Mogakolodi Ngele at SuperSport United. Kadodia said the arrival of Twala did not mean he was a replacement for the Zimbabwean, who scored seven league goals for the team.) Meanwhile, Pirates confirmed on their website yesterday that they had loaned midfielder Riyaad Norodien to relegation-threatened Platinum Stars for the rest of the season. Norodien follows his Pirates teammate Ayanda Gcaba, who was also loaned to the Rustenburg outfit on Monday.On Monday Bucs confirmed the signing of two strikers, Xola Mlambo from Bidvest Wits and Zambian international Augustine Mulenga. Norodien’s former club Ajax Cape Town also announced their own signings, welcoming on-loan Sundowns defender Siyanda Zwane, who joined his teammate Yannick Zakri on Monday.
