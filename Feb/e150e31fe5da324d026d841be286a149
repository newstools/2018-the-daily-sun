CLINTON Larsen reckons exiting the Nedbank Cup early could be a blessing in disguise for Golden Arrows, with a top eight league finish now a priority. With the benefits of a leaner fixture schedule, Larsen will be able to focus on the remaining 10 league matches to try and make up for the cup disappointment with a strong finish in the Absa Premiership. Arrows squandered another chance to claim silverware this season, crashing 3-0 to Kaizer Chiefs in the Last 32 round at the weekend. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvXEjeV2m98DqNWilONVawgCRmEPZf7Sw5ikz0q5FX-dfLnAZfY5E1pQKhM4-qiyOmwEzWC737JGcyKp-je3Q9HiVFc27XAG-6tzJT0rFSB7DSfENiJ7yQKyV783zT3MZO9ll6w8xAt6z_Dzb6tWL1WbiegofsxoSqJWuKM1AvwQqk8VzzLTBos9v4byNqFmLy1emleiRXtc9mcPcSyI19z1vlNhWBszWWaoT-CUqVMhk374-5n4ufyoJSzzbjOgwX6HIUXczZL4XFtTCsj0qRZ8g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIXdFgLwtnY0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But some may look at the loss another way and say it’s a blessing in disguise that we are out of the tournament,” said Larsen. “We can focus on the 10 league games and get the necessary points to move us up the table.  “I believe that we have what it takes to get out of the situation we are in currently. “We are one win away from basically being back in the top eight and among the teams competing for the top spot.  “Still, a win would have gone some way in boosting our confidence.”  Sitting in 12th spot with 23 points, Arrows are some way from the comfort zone, as two defeats could suck them right into the relegation whirlpool. They welcome equally troubled Bidvest Wits at Princess Magogo Stadium on Saturday. Wits are a point below them in the league table.  Abafana Bes’thende’s form took a dip following a bright start to the season, the team ultimately going on a 12-game winless streak. The poor run ended with a 1-0 win over SuperSport United last month, but they have since gone on to draw two matches and lose another in their last three outings. Arrows’ defeat to Amakhosi exposed some weaknesses, which would explain their poor league run. Injuries have also hounded Larsen’s team, as defender Lehlohonolo Nonyane wobbled off with a knock against Chiefs, at a time when fellow right back, Zolani Nkombelo, is also still recovering from injury. “We will need to assess our injury situation now ahead of our home game,” Larsen said.
