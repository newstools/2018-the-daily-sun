the department's mandate to undertake regular inspections."As part of its mandate, the inspectorate directorate
of the department undertakes regular inspections on the basis of information
provided to them, which information would demand a thorough investigation
including in loco inspections," he said."In this regard, our officials visited ANN7 Studios to
verify information related to visas of certain individuals employed by the
organisation," Mokgola said.One employee at ANN7 told News24 immigration officers came
for staff members recruited from India."The office was filled with immigration officers. I
have never seen something like that before. The employees that were recruited
from India were taken into an office, and they looked nervous. We don't know
what's happening," he said."I am not sure how many staff members we have from
India but it's a lot," the employee said.Another employee said he was about to leave when he saw
immigration officers on the premises."I just saw some immigration officers inside a certain
room where we host our guests. It was about four of them that I saw," he
said.Manyi did not immediately answer his phone for comment.SOURCE: NEWS24
