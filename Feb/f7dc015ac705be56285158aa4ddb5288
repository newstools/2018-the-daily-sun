Therefore, they qualify to be transferred to medium security prisons closer to their families.“This is negligence and ignorance of their rights,” he said.However, prison boss Lazarus Ncongwane dismissed the allegations. “This is news to me. None of the inmates are on strike here,” he insisted. Ncongwane said they were not involved in a transfer process. He said only the department of correctional services could deal with transfers.
