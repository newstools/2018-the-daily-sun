I had to spend most of the time attending school than being on the field. But now I’m done with school and am a better player than before,” he said.Tshakhuma, who are led by experienced Sello Chokoe, are second in the NFD log with 33 points, eight points behind log leaders Highlands Park (41).Ndlovu said Tshakhuma’s main focus was to stay consistent and maintain their position on the log now.He stated: “As a team, we’re not at our best yet, but we can still do better. Our defensive line has been poor and we’ll need to put in more effort. In the remaining league games anything can happen.”“Two matches can change everything at the top we could even find ourselves winning the promotion to the Absa Premiership.”Arguably, if Ndlovu started the season with Tshakhuma in August he could have been among the league top scorers by now.Tshakhuma will today visit Cape Town All Stars at Athlone Stadium 3.30pm.Modibedi  Mokoena (Super Eagles), Mpho Erasmus (Mthatha Bucks) and Real Kings Nkosingiphile Phewa are the NFD top scorers with 10 each player.Ubuntu Cape Town, Mthatha Bucks and Royal Eagles are struggling as they are in position 16,15 and 14 respectively.
