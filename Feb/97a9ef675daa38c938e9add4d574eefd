GIVING up is not an option for Kaizer Chiefs and their head coach Steve Komphela! Despite being seven points off the pace in the Absa Premiership title race, Komphela and his troops still believe that leaders Mamelodi Sundowns can be caught at the top of the table. The Soweto giants’ 1-1 draw with Bidvest Wits in their Absa Premiership encounter at Milpark Stadium at the weekend felt like a defeat to Komphela. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssDB7N679hjomG-pYtl4-tDB-WIXP-fYG3kT5TEOrH8l9SRLqwH7vm9JBqatIRJ6y1F1Iv0ipveWMAUKnDBEJhWOS1Bsh3FMkwLl3fUFGhnjVdtRelQYPGQhQKEavjtninVLUtcPIQ7UFlA9Y9RBUfpR3h4ynnrnqw8L6MNZL1ytNz-WkE2Uy2ZJP8AW2a9XEe2uvTp1BCaH-icnXJiwLw17YS8upwKIrLrW8J74yBsUbQVyH53n9psEgxxVf2xjkQC11L1eA6F-9rcJJ2pxOlu8w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCeHQC1gXrPrEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The Ntshangase one-on-one with the Wits keeper could have punished them. “Castro also missed a great chance. It feels like a defeat. But we refuse to give up, it’s not over. We will keep fighting and we still believe we can dethrone Sundowns.” Komphela was happy with 21-year-old striker Moon’s contribution: “If we want to win the championship, we have to attack and score goals. Ryan scores big goals and he is doing well. We will keep pushing him.”
