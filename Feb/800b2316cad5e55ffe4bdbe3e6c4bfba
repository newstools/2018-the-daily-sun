My health started to suffer when he disappeared. I haven’t had a good night’s sleep since I last saw him.”Zanele Sikhosana (32), Daniel’s sister, said: “When we noticed he was missing, I tried to call his cellphone but it just rang unanswered.”She said when they tried to call his phone again, a man who claimed to have picked up Daniel’s cellphone at Kwaggafontein Plaza answered. “We don’t understand how his phone ended up there,” said Zanele. “His girlfriend’s neighbours said he was last seen with her. Even the girlfriend’s mum said my brother was with her that Sunday. Now the girlfriend has also disappeared.” Police spokesman Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said a missing person’s case was opened. He encouraged anyone with information to contact Vosman cop shop on 013 659 8464.
