John’s daughter, Sibongile Nakedi (51) said her dad was a pastor and he first met the woman when she went to him seeking divine intervention. She said after her mum died, her father married the woman in secret. On Friday the family was shocked to learn that the madala’s body had been exhumed from the New Roodepoort Cemetery in Dobsonville, Soweto.“The security guards at the cemetery told us a bakkie came and took the body away, with people claiming to be family members,” said Sibongile. She said the family investigated and found a fraudulent court interdict had been used to exhume the body. She said when they went to the undertakers who had buried her father, they confirmed that her father’s wife had requested the exhumation. “We cannot live without knowing my father’s final resting place. He will haunt us,” said Sibongile. The second wife said: “I am not going to speak to you and I do not know what you are talking about.”Captain Jeanette Phefo confirmed that cases of fraud and disturbing the dead were opened, but said no arrest had been made.
