DAVID Miya accompanied his wife to a sangoma to be cleansed. The 46-year-old man said the sangoma insisted on cleansing him too. “He said I was too weak and cut me with a razor so blood could come out. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>“He then took that blood and said he was going to give me strength,” he said. It’s been nine years but he finds himself worse off than when he went to the sangoma. “My wife’s life was not going well and she had suggested we go see a sangoma. “Since then, people say every time they look at my face they see a tokoloshe,” he said.David said he now lives in fear as some peole want to attack him. “I’ve gone to several other sangomas to get help, but they all tell me to go back to the same sangoma to reverse the process.“The problem is I don’t know where to find the sangoma. He has moved. “I can’t even find a place to live as landlords say I look like a tokoloshe.” He now sleeps in a truck at his workplace.Sangoma Sarah Ndlovu said the sangoma who helped him didn’t do a proper job and that’s why David is suffering today.
