SIYANDA Zwane’s eyes are firmly fixed on helping Ajax Cape Town avoid relegation.The tough-as-teak defender reckons his move from Mamelodi Sundowns on a six-month loan deal will help him get much-needed game time.Said Zwane: “I joined Ajax because I wanted to play more. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstBDGt4q5YKpQzU4QsJugenA9WjlKmEKYgghsnGemypcORljkxdx5ETTszEZ5l_JSDTVj4DPpXZkldPs_JX89kUkvVq2NJYarDv7m1S7-fUrc65KjF-g4w0SQlnhZQh6plq_dDwKxahGdwBhIr-0VcRfirXLhNiTtd6HbtVV9SMExpd7LbyryQ4N0J_XcWH5mQpAwUcAutseeJKmHV7Iy59MaM_HF17cm25ExXXi5ZPW-Ts_KsgseBEClZPxUhPwj7VragcEmoFWnnGA1mvkIB4Vw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNtr2CnGEBoREAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I’m grateful to coach (Muhsin Ertugral) for giving me the chance to come here. It was an easy decision to make because I know what he wants as we worked well together at Golden Arrows.”Zwane spent most of his time warming the bench at Chloorkop, but says the hunger to succeed is still there.He made only two starts and the same number of substitute appearances for Downs this season.“I still want to achieve more. I want to help Ajax end the season in a respectable position. We have quality players in the team who are capable of reaching the target,” he said.Zwane knows he will need to bring his A game to help youngsters who will be looking up to him for guidance to climb up the league table.“I’m used to pressure, playing for Sundowns is pressure on its own. Ajax style of play differs from Sundowns and I need to adjust quickly.“I’m not match-fit, but I have the experience to deliver and give my best for the supporters,” he added.Ertugral rates Zwane highly as he believes his ability to defend and attack will come in handy for the Cape Town outfit.His arrival means youngster Sirgio Kammies will sit back and gain valuable experience from Zwane.Explained Ertugral: “I always believed in Siyanda and I’m glad he’s here. He has a great engine and hopefully he can immediately fill the position.”
