"The spirit of Madibaness - the Madiba Magic Moment personified through our sports stars’ excellent performances whilst also uniting our country along the way - is a remarkable feature in the history of our sporting achievements. "It is, in fact, these Madiba Magic Moments which we regard as a legacy left to the sporting fraternity. After all the nation continues to unite patriotically when an athlete delivers this Madiba Magic Moment."
