Speaking to Daily Sun, Thandazile said she got the shock of her life when she woke up and found her ring gone. According to Thandazile, two weeks ago Ayanda took the ring off her finger and took his belongings, as well as a car which she says she bought, and left. She later learnt he had hit the road with his nyatsi. Heartbroken Thandazile said she understands it’s over between her and Ayanda, but she wants her ring and car back.“I bought that car but since we are married in community of property it belongs to both of us. I know he was cheating on me but he should have left my things and just left alone.”Ayanda said: “Whatever I left with is none of your business. I took what belonged to me.“If she wants to talk to me, she must call me, not go through a newspaper.”
