They complained they had not been paid for months, and that staff members had been fired for no reason.Makinita said: “I do not regret my decision because our working conditions are tough.” Veteran presenter Mokopi Molebatsi received a letter saying her contract would not be renewed when it ends next month. She said she was seeking legal advice and could not talk about the matter.Staff have accused station manager David Mabusela of doing business for the station through his private company, despite him being a full-time employee. Mabusela told Daily Sun it was normal to terminate contracts when they were about to end. He said he held a meeting with his legal team over staff members whom he said had brought the station into disrepute.
