She was told she could have the box if she resigned and gave her pension money to the bogus pastor.” Thakeng said after the woman resigned, she was instructed to withdraw all the money she was paid out from her pension, which amounted to R265 000, and give it to the pastor. “He disappeared with the pension money and the victim never got the R4 million. The victim then realised she had been scammed and reported the incident to the police,” he said. “A case of theft was registered for further investigation. The bogus pastor and a man named King Bagyenyi Justus are wanted for allegedly disappearing with the victim’s pension money. “If anyone has information that could lead to the arrest of these suspects, they should contact detective Warrant Officer Nelville Wessels on 076 485 8289.”
