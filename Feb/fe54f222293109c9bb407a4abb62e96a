AJAX Cape Town coach Muhsin Ertugral is a man who loves a challenge! The Turkish mentor once said he would leave Mzansi for good after his disastrous spell with Orlando Pirates last season, but the daunting task of saving the Urban Warriors from relegation has brought him back to the Premier Soccer League. The Cape outfit hammered the Buccaneers 3-0 in a league game in the Mother City last week, but Pirates avenged that defeat with a 2-0 win to boot them out of the Nedbank Cup in the Last 32 round at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Bernard Morrison’s brace, the two goals scored on either side of half-time, did the damage. But Ertugral saw the defeat as a blessing in disguise that allows them to shift their focus to the league as they attempt to avoid the axe.Ertugral has targeted home matches for dodging the dreaded axe and is impressed with what he has seen since taking charge of the Urban Warriors. “We have Golden Arrows, SuperSport United and Bloemfontein Celtic coming up, and these are massive games for us. I believe we will survive relegation,” said the coach.“I love being associated with Ajax. I did say I was leaving for good but I didn’t think twice when I was asked to come back. I believe I can save them. They are a breeding ground for young stars.” Bucs didn’t protest the inclusion of former striker Tendai Ndoro for the Urban Warriors, as they had already done so in their last league clash. Ertugral insists, however, that he will continue to field the player until told otherwise. He said: “I find it a bit strange when a player leaves and he is told he can’t play. I believe it’s a misinterpretation of issues and that it will be sorted out.” The coach added that he would tighten things up at the back.
