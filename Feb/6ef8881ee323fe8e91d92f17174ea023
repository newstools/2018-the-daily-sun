THE usually busy roads leading to Tshwane from Hammanskraal, north of the capital, were deserted during rush hour early yesterday morning.This came after a shutdown by taxi drivers left thousands of commuters stranded.The taximen are apparently angered by the refusal of the City of Tshwane to allow them to drive into the CBD.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstfL7X0AJKcDiBxM0nfIZiZATEQhc5is0yvqASIAkxdazP4ZNB5909IXnoZ2qkKfQB2C1QhfNBkYCR6GCYCII9rCg1CjKrIxoVeWzbxM-sOLNv6Lb6hUrqRB_lIrnxsPpXNfUmb7LtukgZLvNGXXwReZKSAzBxs4O2bTXC4c4SqWgMrShdyHzow9XlPwlC2-ZsUAtnVCQ_ridOM9OWUc-TJWKg1qzC-uGXdKHw6JJg-7EW3z4JVlR7cUmObnH_jcgFVWfMk3Ppin6l1ZKqSELQk9Bm2K7o\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YS47L2o_s0h8No1ICdIgEzRRBUzRDIFEbleobAUWqiEY_vE8c5g2b9f_8y-Ueh2OsEdMIpjd2VjejyVOX7N-KNVbBQvuzOwirZHfkNDyw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEqTEbluJ1nNEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They then delivered a memorandum of demands.On Tuesday the taxis forcibly transported people into the city, but they were escorted out by Tshwane metro cops.That did not sit well with them and they later took a decision to shut down their township.Taxi users said while they understood frustrations of the taxi owners, they were the ones left suffering and called for a better way to resolve the matter.Sheila Senkubuge, member of the mayoral committee for roads and transport, said taxi owners were paid R300 000 for each taxi in an agreement last year that they would not be operating in the city.“They agreed that their taxi route would end at Wonderboom Junction. Commuters should use buses from there to get into town,” said Senkubuge.
