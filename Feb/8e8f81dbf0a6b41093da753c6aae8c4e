wife’s firm when there was, in fact, no evidence of a contract between the city
and the said company, Lephatsi Financial Services,” the apology reads.“On our page 2, the headline also referred to “job for wife’s
pal”, which we accept may have given an impression the mayor had employed, and
was paying a salary to his former business associate when this was not the
case. “An important comment from the city to the effect that Mashaba had
declared his association with Lephatsi to the city was erroneously left out of
the story during the editing process, hence robbing our readers an opportunity
to get a complete and balanced view of the matters involved. That, too, we
regret.”Mashaba said: “It remains my belief that the media plays a
critical role in ensuring accountability form public representations.“However, it is vital that that journalists are thorough and
impartial in their reporting,” he said.
