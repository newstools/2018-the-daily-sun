Linda deserves this next step in her career. She has proven herself at the Olympics in Rio on a global stage. This contract opens doors for the world of women’s football to get to know her.”Motlhalo joins several Banyana Banyana players who are plying their trade abroad – Kaylin Swart, Amogelang Motau, Robyn Moodaly, and Kelso Peskin, among others.Pauw added: “The experience that the South African players bring in the country will not only add value to Banyana Banyana because of her growth in the game, but I am convinced it will also open the doors for others. “Scouts will start to visit South Africa, whereas before not many knew about the high potential South African players can offer,”.Motlhalo has just completed her matric and plans are afoot for her to continue with her studies abroad.“This just a perfect scenario, something we planned with her family back in 2016. Gratitude goes to her parents and uncle who have been instrumental in how we plan her success in life, their support has been phenomenal. I can only say the sky is the limit for her,” said Pauw.She is expected to leave for Houston Dash at the beginning of March – pending receipt of her P-1 Visa and International Transfer Certificate, the club announced on Thursday.Motlhalo made her debut with the South Africa’s Senior Women’s National Team at 17, scoring a goal in the 2-2 draw with Cameroon.Like this story?
