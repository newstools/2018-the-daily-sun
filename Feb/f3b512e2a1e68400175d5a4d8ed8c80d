RESIDENTS from NU 14 in Mdantsane, East London have lost all hope their road will ever be fixed. The residents said they lodged their first complaint in 2009 to their councillor at the time. And, in the last nine years the road has become worse. Gogo Selina Kampi (80) said taxis had even stopped using the road because it was too dangerous. She said they’ve had two accidents in the last month.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuzC47seTElA9CvmTqbTkCf5ejEFITgvROSjaXmTo8r6oHqGauwIbRypAp1Bv9sT_PVdQDZF1YPDiFTo4mwP3fv3fAPrkY4mZ974oY18jSCHv8KU3gUae-QG2MOxWF508FlWwQJ4hC5niATDB_nZmMREuEhd_JSXhePeKhwGsY55z54VNkwK_NVt_xJd-iHCQWqJ95AL8ZbgzYCsItOUapJHQAMxEzFAMNZMnFzTd4Byn6OTx2kzEmCRnNOGdrmOiGOYk8nbwo7W9xYD8_I-qezx60pKcw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGOq52ZL1l4tEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

She said they had to pay someone to walk them to the main road, which is about 100m away. Joseph Mdudu (62), who went blind in 1997 after an accident at work, said it was tough for him to live there. “The road is very uneven and I can fall anytime. I have to pay people to help me to the road,” he said. Herbert Delany (41) said people suffer when there’s a funeral because they can’t have a service at their homes. “People can’t park near their homes and we have a problem with the bush opposite our homes. Thugs hide in there and attack passersby,” he said.Councillor Xolani Simandla said the problem started when the company contracted to repair roads went into financial difficulty. “Their contract was terminated in August last year. The Buffalo City Metro Municipality has already awarded a new contract.” He said a meeting will be held on Sunday to tell residents when construction would start.
