We want to know what happened to the money they were supposed to get from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. “We realised that something was wrong and decided to join them in protest,” she said. “We heard some of the lecturers do not understand the content of the modules they are teaching. It is clear they are unqualified.” One student said corruption was high at the college.“If you raise your voice, you will be expelled. What are they hiding, because they do not want to listen to different views.”Campus manager Elias Mbokane received the students’ memorandum and promised to respond to the protesters soon.
