Last November Daily Sun told his story about how he was struggling to get an ID and as a result could not receive a grant. Home Affairs officials intervened, and three months later Samson, a breadwinner, is a happy man.“I now feel like a man because I can provide for my family,” he said.Samson said he almost gave up on life because he felt useless.“If it wasn’t for Daily Sun, I would still be depressed, living without a purpose in life. Now I know that I am important.” His niece, Maggy Mokwena (47) said she was relieved as they had visited nine Home Affairs offices before Daily Sun intervened.
