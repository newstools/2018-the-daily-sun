We got in the box, trying to find our way. “There was no moment where we saw their keeper (Patrick Tignyemb) in a one-on-one situation with our players, which was overwhelming. But we had to find a way.”He said they regretted not having won the match, as they could have scored once or even twice to narrow the gap on Sundowns.“It was a massive opportunity. But we are still keeping them close,” Komphela said, indicating that they would settle for a point since they weren’t able to win. “But we didn’t lose either.We always play to win, it is a fact.”Komphela will spend the rest of this week preparing his charges for Africa’s biggest derby against Orlando Pirates at FNB Stadium on Saturday, and says he is not shaken.“The Pirates game will be interesting,” he said. “It is one match where I think, based on the way Pirates have been playing and the way we play, you will see goals.”It should be a match tacticians would regard as a better definition of the game in South Africa, he told SuperSport TV.He added: “Both teams have a similar approach – playing a back three. This is a game where maybe coaches would take a 4-3-4 approach. It will be a match of high intensity. I would also, as coach, like to watch that match on Sunday!”
