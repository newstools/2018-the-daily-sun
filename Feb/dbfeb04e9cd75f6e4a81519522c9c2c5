NATIONAL Football Consultative Forum (NFCF) member Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana is set to send a letter to Fifa to report alleged mischievous dealings by the Football Transformation Forum (FTF) in (Safa) regions ahead of the organisation's elective congress in March.There were concerns raised by regions, who have not been allowed to exercise their democratic right, with a supposed intention of manipulating the nomination forms to ensure that the preferred candidate is incumbent, Danny Jordaan, and no-one else.“SAFA leadership has embarked on a programme to destabilise the processes. For instance, since early this year there is a gentleman, known in the football circles, who was appointed by Jordaan as his Eastern Cape agent ‘overseeing’ all electoral procedures in the region. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssuco0RH1dAJlzgwuFSABBWjL3UA8o6ZA5cqw7M_uuu3YLVpI_xz31bhzLZaMaAn-_6zovSySesL7656LTWToKIjX86qflgGoirBszSu043p75jRlPPWHwvJ6CFRh5Bn0tsGtCQi9VZRjSD0cMEhpmguEwnySqxcN16X3AYu3xFKPZAyzUP4roGlHnL4ACmGoYOAsaRNa8z-8z7f8O-EPdmPsiOXivpqaVZhAV90l3zghvaGBVK718tfMn9QL-mlipERFYR0oQUfnSCMhsq\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPbzN-qeswGCEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We have reasons to believe that SAFA leadership has convened a national meeting in Bloemfontein this coming weekend to collect all nominee forms.”Chief Nonkonyana continued: “We have consequently decided to file a complaint with FIFA as we believe that the entire electoral process is rigged, filled with irregularities and contraventions of SAFA, CAF and FIFA statutes. We’ve kept quite despite concerns about the decision made in December to move the Elective Congress to March instead of the usual September date...we believe that it was an obvious tactic to ensure that there is one unopposed candidate.” Chief Nonkonyana, who serves as Chairman of the National House of Traditional Leaders in the Eastern Cape, was also alarmed about messages sent by FTF representatives to fellow traditional leaders, about how he plans to “abandon” his traditional duties should he be voted in to the SAFA structures.“I am not sure why, but FTF is making a mockery of the House, telling traditional leaders that I plan on abandoning my traditional duties when I return to the SAFA structures. The only plan is to replace their current, toxic football administration.”Chief Nonkonyana will share the context of his letter to FIFA with the general public later on in the week.
