We rushed to the scene and called an ambulance and cops. The driver was nowhere to be seen,” she said.“The pedestrian was on her way to work when she was hit by the taxi.”A parent said she got a call from her friend and rushed to the scene to find her 11-year-old daughter in the ambulance. “She told me the taxi was speeding. She is traumatised. I almost lost my only child,” she said. She said she was going to organise another taxi to transport her child to school.“My child started using the taxi this month. The driver was recommended by my neighbour. I don’t know anything about him,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “The driver allegedly lost control of his vehicle and it overturned. “Pupils sustained minor injuries and were taken to hospital for medical attention. A case of reckless and negligent driving was opened for investigation.”
