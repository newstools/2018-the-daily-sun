The SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) has filed papers at the Constitutional Court asking for a six month extension of its contract with Cash Paymasters Services (CPS).Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi told News24 on Thursday that this was part of its "phase in, phase out" system to allow CPS to hand over to the South African Post Office."We don't want to collapse the system. That is the only reason we are asking for this extension," he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuNe9XnqNidiOz_6UH4xjULyRPuIi6NcAqBeOdp7SiNLS4ZQnNuVRutuUS4De8f9iF4nXuxjxCZV7ve_vEQCLJ69Rffu84TJ2-BBkr3czDSLOdcmQh1VM6DEGlnknSQBUUaY4g87tvtfmSdEoPThZYUCPg5mUzwkNn11t453Rj5dbdbKz9-yKqw-6FiEg71cJSJNxj3WBMXLzhFpeXCPhFcXD1leFKx9cR63jxW5jXb4Y7wcX1p0FxpeZRC6iVrcAtjO6YOUzW17RiM_DptCvWq6g7a7CY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKmasUSRgcHuEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
