He even gave my wife a place to stay when she left me,” he said. Kabelo said he received an eviction letter from the Rama Tribunal Council, where his wife works, giving him seven days to move out.On Tuesday, Kabelo’s belongings were moved to his mum’s house without him even getting a warning. When the SunTeam contacted Rethabile, she directed questions to her lawyer, Peter Ntsoko. Ntsoko said Kabelo was lying as the lease agreement for their house said only married couples could live there. His uncle Mpho said he was heartbroken by the allegations made by Kabelo. He said he didn’t know Rethabile very well and she had never stayed with him. “It would be a shame for me to date a girl young enough to be my daughter. I’d rather date her mother,” he said.
