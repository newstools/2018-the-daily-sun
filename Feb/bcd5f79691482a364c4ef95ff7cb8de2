Following a shootout, six suspects were arrested including two who were wounded. "The wounded suspects were taken to hospital under police guard. Some of items taken from the business were recovered from the suspects. The suspects were charged for armed robbery and attempted. "A manhunt is underway for those suspects that escaped," said Zwane. In Mountain Rise near Pietermaritzburg at 18:00, police officers from the K9 Unit responded reports of a suspicious vehicle on Lincoln Road. Zwane said When police officers approached the vehicle, the suspects sped off and a chase ensued. The suspects drove into a cul de sac where they attempted to flee from their vehicle. They then opened fire at police officers and in the ensuing gun battle four suspects were shot and wounded. "A fifth suspect was caught by a police dog as he attempted to flee. "All five suspects were detained and four firearms were seized," said ZwaneAll five suspects will appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court on Monday."We are also appealing to members of the community not to open false cases as it is a crime to do so. A lot of police resources are wasted while there are other serious cases that could have been attended to. On Sunday, a man and a woman who opened a false robbery case at Tongaat were arrested after an investigation by police. "It is alleged that they reported to police that two suspects approached them while they were at work at a bar in Tongaat. They claimed that they were robbed of cash and alcohol at gunpoint."A case of armed robbery was opened and after an initial investigation on the crime scene by police it became apparent that these allegations were false. Cash was seized from the duo and they were charged with defeating the ends of justice," said Zwane.
