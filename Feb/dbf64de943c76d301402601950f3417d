On 18 September, Kedibone gave birth naturally, even though she was told the injection was usually given to patients giving birth by caesarean section. “Kedibone told us what happened,” said her father George Kotsedi (52).She was transferred to George Mukhari Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa with instructions that she should be treated as a mental patient. She told doctors what happened and they transferred her back to Rustenburg and Swartruggens hospitals, and was then sent home. She died on 20 January, leaving behind two kids and four-month old Othatile.Family members said they knew about patients’ rights and there were no signed documents to authorise the injection.Provincial heath spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane, said a medical team assessed Kedibone and many investigations were done, including a lumbar puncture and assessment of the cerebrospinal fluid. She was diagnosed with tubercular meningitis and treatment was started. When she went into premature labour, scans were done and she was referred for specialist neurosurgery. “A plan was developed and a follow-up date set but she was reported to have died before the scheduled follow-up.” Lekgethwane said at the request of the family, a police investigation is being done together with the hospital and forensic services to confirm the cause of death.
