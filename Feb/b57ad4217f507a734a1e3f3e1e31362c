GATVOL parents have threatened to burn down Mayibuye Primary School if the education department does not send contractors for repairs. The trouble at the school in Snake Park, Soweto, was caused by a storm that damaged four classrooms last month. Concerned parents told Daily Sun the first term would soon be over and the children would have learned nothing. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Lebogang Madlala (30), a parent, said: “It’s frustrating to go to work and leave my child at home. It’s not safe. Kids are roaming the streets and the department is doing nothing to help us. At the same time, it’s a risk sending them to school as they could be injured.” Lebogang said when she called the department, she was told many other schools also needed repairs and Mayibuye wasn’t special. The teachers tried to make a plan by teaching the 250 pupils in the staff room and the principal’s office, but that did not work. SGB chairman Robert Phula said they held multiple meetings with parents and decided it was not safe to have the kids at school. “We have contacted the department several times. They only sent an official on Tuesday to assess the damage. The kids have missed 24 days of school,” said Robert.  The department’s spokesman, Steve Mabona, said they had finalised the process to appoint a service provider, who would be introduced to Mayibuye by the end of the week.
