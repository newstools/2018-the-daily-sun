In a separate incident, police at Bothashoop, near Piet Retief bust four suspects on Sunday night for the same offence.Sedibe said police were on patrol when they spotted a woman with a child standing next to a field of mealies. “The cops stopped and asked the woman why she was there. “She told police they were waiting for transport,” Sedibe told Daily Sun.“Police had suspicions and pretended to be leaving, but kept the woman and child under surveillance. “Then a bakkie with three occupants came and stopped next to them. “The occupants were seen loading something into the back of the bakkie and driving off. “The police signalled at the driver to stop and found packs of dagga wrapped in a brown parcel with an estimated street value of R120 000.”Four suspects between the ages of 24 and 43 appeared in the Piet Retief Magistrates Court on Tuesday, and were kept in jail for further investigation.
