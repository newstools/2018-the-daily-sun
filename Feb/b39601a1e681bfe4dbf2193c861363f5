THE Raletjena family can’t believe one of the suspects arrested for their son’s murder is his friend.  The family from Mokhurumela Village outside Bochum, Limpopo claim the last time they saw their son alive was when he left home visit his friend. He told his family he’d received a number of missed calls from him that day. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss2xIQZKjF3OgDTmZxPStssYEFVYOa1hxQumuOpMGAPN6xEuCtytmm8WW_YFlFNnq1iZVboo8djHgrDonrDxYrO9blE3mAZV3k02j36glEw2Wfdv-nYDos3FZ7N0HHOhz-Tp0skCtV3m4Mf6BFemG1ImQNrJ94GzBNVsGdZKmVUVOceCwXRnoq6DRaw3IMwyxX2apMFSyUrCyMUAEHzgcbN9RH_QFD6tI1w-51tTVqkH3rO7AZ4qR1Q1po1m6ufPB_VRxR5HbJzb0pTTmOiV0TxKUCYGrI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzK9BesqWnICVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He was found in the bush with another villager, Hector Teffo. They were brutally assaulted and left for dead.His mother, Tiny Raletjena, said: “When I got to the bush I found Matras covered in blood. My son had huge open wounds all over his head. His mouth and eyes were swollen. When I called out his name he couldn’t recognise me and was not even breathing properly. My son’s killers were so heartless.” The two men were taken to Helen Franz Hospital in Bochum. Two days later Matras died from his injuries while Hector recovered a week later and was discharged.Three suspects, including Matras’ friend Phangweng Lekaba (28), Matome Machaba (22) and Thabang Mokgawa (23), were arrested. They were charged with murder, attempted murder and kidnapping. Matras’ aunt Mmaphophi Raletjena said: “I still can’t believe the arrested boys are people we know. We believe they were sent to kill them and we want that person arrested. Justice must prevail. We are now living in fear because we don’t know what will happen to us.” The suspects appeared briefly at the Senwabarwana Magistrates Court on Thursday. They were kept in police custody and will appear again on Thursday for a formal bail application.
