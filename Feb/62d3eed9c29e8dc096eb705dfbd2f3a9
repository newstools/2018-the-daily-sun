THESE residents are tired of living like pigs.  The people of Captain Charles kasi, near Bethlehem in the Free State, recently told Daily Sun they had complained many times about illegal dumping in their area but nothing was done. They said they didn’t have proper toilets either and they were left with the bucket system, which was not serviced regularly by the Dihlabeng Municipality. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssigUgpbNKifN9PGDF3nfctTT-VFkDlJVgNQZDMzJURc8Wks3ANQYCwHw_8JtDUfMQQjlaYiHmo5OZI8DrZV7_eBs-7NngNFqFifce8D660FuvOXHJr2Rz22e0GzZ1wDdmlYbBm7e-F9bdfxMmLprGkN1Y7vtzngShjXVM9wnP7Pa8ZtdXCVsGirE38LiEaHVU_l_EsGEdGeQL9JkYoGE4V-9NHpm3cpJyOULRqd52KkEfZ7rk5bsrDeb4Ok56j3fF8G5GVhsQ3sgk1TJB0ezyU0XoGK6k\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPJ7F8U6oRUlEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We have reported our problems but nothing gets done.” She said officials had promised to act on the illegal dumping and do something about the toilet situation but never followed through. “We are still waiting. When nature calls, we have to go to the bush,” she said. “We are giving them one last chance. If they don’t come and clean up this mess, we will protest.“We hope this doesn’t turn out to be the only way we can get them to listen.” Municipal spokesman Tshediso Maitse denied the allegations made by residents. “We are aware of the complaints in regard to the cleaning of the buckets,” he said. “We are working hard to address the complaint by cleaning the toilets more frequently. “The municipality’s solid waste section regularly cleans communal refuse points. “The residents must also play their part in maintaining a clean environment by not dumping everywhere. “They must make sure they take their refuse out on the specific days when municipal workers come to collect it.”
