My firearm is always with me. I got it in 1989 and it is always in my safe, it has never been fired,” He went on to say that he could only talk for himself and not on behalf of his adult son, whom he rarely saw.  “I rushed to the house. I found Kelly, Longwe and another childhood friend of Senzo’s. Senzo was lying there. They said two guys came in and wanted to rob them. I don’t want to talk on behalf of Longwe. He’s an adult. I want to talk about my part.”SEE ALSO: SKOLOPAD DRAGGED FOR DEFENDING CHICCO’S SON!He said he would not stand in the way of justice if his son was involved.“If Longwe had killed Senzo, I promise you Masechaba, I would be the first person to act. I don’t care. He’s my son. But if he killed Senzo, I would have pushed for him to go to jail. Leave me out of this thing. I wasn’t there.”Chicco also denied any knowledge about alleged death threats that Senzo’s father, Sam Meyiwa had been receiving.“I will definitely ask the SAPS to try and assist Mr Meyiwa and investigate and find the culprit.“The police should do their job” he said.ICYMI: SENZO MURDER COVER-UP!
