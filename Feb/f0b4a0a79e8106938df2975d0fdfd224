You start by asking for her opinion on a certain subject.“Once you’re through the first stage, change the topic and get to know her.”He said complimenting a woman was a good way to get past the first stage. He said his seminars and courses emphasise the importance of respecting women.“It’s about getting the woman of your dreams. No woman wants to date a jerk,” he said.
