THE
South African Communist Party (SACP) in Gauteng has called on Public Protector,
Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane to urgently investigate the allegations against the
Executive Mayor of the City of Johannesburg, Herman Mashaba."A
formal letter has already been sent to the Public Protector through our local
district of Linda Jabane (City of Johannesburg)," the SACP said.  The
SACP Gauteng Provincial Secretary Jacob Mamabolo said they are further shocked
by the conspicuous silence of the DA’s bedfellows, the fast degenerating and
irrelevant EFF.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstqEHvuB1e4o4hsfwds3q7xbz1FhEXbMks-ES87ImPSKZK4ahNpNB5hEQCcGqDooiXTCYmp07-_7zNDDPQYhAJwtf412lyxw67EAMlPD6cnCnMyTwPlp1JYISbEixKmGQqp7ZonAFRqyxnagJFIjCoQmnjVvYZZ_x-zXWtkHSX5nhvbvjWxH3uuJS8mnVuQXnbzcw0_55dB8eb6pcj_eNcWPv09XJkwnYic7JdhbIJTslf8J1dNRCPA5ShaqFw84GJwQcsms3im_1CN41ybyjvtNiF9Nww\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPFyPUE6wFrAEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

principled call for an investigation follows revelations that Mayor Herman
Mashaba allegedly enlisted the services of his wife’s business to assist the
Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality in its official government business,” he
saidMashaba
has since confirmed the allegations and refuted the claims that the company
linked to his wife Connie Mashaba’s known as Lephatsi Financial Services was
doing business with the city."We
are deeply shocked by his ridiculous and frivolous claim that his wife’s
company did not draw any financial benefit from the deal, thus suggesting a
“free lunch” with a business person," the SACP added. The
SACP believes that the checks and balances guaranteed by our constitution do
not allow us to leave this matter swept under the carpet.
