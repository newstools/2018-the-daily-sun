One of those dead set on seeing the film canned is author and singer Xoli Nosenga.He told Daily Sun he was not impressed by what he saw. He said: “The people who made the movie don’t have a solid story to tell. “It’s not true that we don’t want the film because we have a problem with gays and lesbians. “The film portrays caregivers as people who sleep with initiates, and that is not true.”He said he knows for a fact that vulgar language is not used. “I can’t sit here and be impressed by the misrepresentation of caregivers,” he said. “They need to be pure to take care of the boys, which proves that no research was done. “They are just belittling Xhosa culture and us as a people.” Xoli said contrary to those people who argue that Nelson Mandela wrote in detail about ulwaluko in his book Long Walk to Freedom and Thando Mgqolozana in A Man Who is Not a Man, none of those two books belittle the tradition. Despite the storm surrounding the film, praise seems to be piling up. It has been added to films that can be streamed on Netflix. Cait Pansegrouw, one of the film’s producers, said Inxeba is not a documentary but a love story set against the backdrop of ulwaluko. “The film was co-written by two Xhosa men who’ve gone through the ritual themselves,” she said. “Over 500 men were interviewed in the process of our research and casting for the film.”
