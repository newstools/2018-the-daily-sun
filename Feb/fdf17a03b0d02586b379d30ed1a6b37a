They may have pretended they had an interview at the station.”“We don’t want to speculate on what really happened as the person is missing. But I have to say that we don’t do interviews at that time of the night, and the security guard locks the gate, and sits away from the gate – only to use a remote controller to open the gate.  “He apparently ushered the robbers into the studio.The men were armed with knives.” Fongoma said they went to Alifios’ place, using the address he gave when he was employed, but were told he hadn’t been living there for a long time. “No family member of his has ever come to ask about him at the station,” she said. “This makes it difficult for management to know if he was abducted or if he’s on the run himself.”  Fongoma asked thamay have seen Alifios to come forward as he may help with information, in case his own life is not in danger.  Police arrived on the same morning to do forensic tests. Lieutenant-Colonel Adele Myburgh said a burglary case was opened. and the case was under investigation. She added that no missing person case had been reported.
