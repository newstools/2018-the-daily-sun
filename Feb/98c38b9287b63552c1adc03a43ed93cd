TOKYO SEXWALE is playing his cards close to his chest.The prominent politician-turned-business tycoon, has not yet committed himself to contest the South African Football Association (Safa) presidential elections, which takes place on 24 March.It was revealed that Sexwale was approached by the National Football Consultative Forum (NFCF) to be their candidate for the Safa elections.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The NFCF is led by former Safa top brass Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana, Mandla “Shoes” Mazibuko, Xolani Mtumtum and Fanyana Sibanyoni. Their mission is to topple the powerful and current Safa president Danny Jordaan.As it has been the norm, the race has taken an ugly turn with the Jordaan camp and the NFCF having engaged in heated exchanges.As Sexwale is sussing out the unfolding situation he is, in the meantime, preaching unity.“There’s division everywhere in this country. There is a disease. It’s very deep. We don’t want football to make the same mistakes that the ANC has made.“The ANC has disappointed people, and so has football. Sport can unite people and if we lose sport, there will be less progress in the social lives of our people.“This virus is killing us as a nation,” said Sexwale.The former Gauteng Premier added that he would not be used to boost the divisive and negative attitudes of people who are only about personal agendas.“I can’t be in the election race with anybody. I’m the one who stood for the unity of Fifa. I won’t add to the divisions because I’m not a power monger. If they approach me as a united force, I’ll do it without any hesitation.“I’ve achieved a lot in my life. I see press conferences where this camp is having a go at that other camp. My commitment and support for SA football is beyond question. I’m not surprised that people approached me,” he said.Sexwale, who once funded the National First Division with his Mvelaphanda League sponsorship, added that there was also a need for change at Safa.“We need to rethink SA football. The head that wears the crown must take responsibility. Anyone who wants to deny that we have problems needs to be properly examined. Bafana Bafana are not private property. If you want people not to talk about Safa, go buy your own club,” Sexwale added.Nomination forms have to be submitted on 22 February, 30 days before the elections as per the Safa statutes.It remains to be seen whether Sexwale’s name will make the list.The likes of Lucas Radebe, former NEC member Nakedi Lekota, and former Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba are said to be contesting for the presidency.Like this story?
