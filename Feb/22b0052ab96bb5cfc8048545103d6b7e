Roger is the one who gave me a break in the Premier Soccer League,” he said of De Sa, who coached him at Ajax Cape Town.“I’m happy with my wife here. Everyone’s been warm to me. But my aim is to help the team survive relegation and also regain my form after an injury setback at Pirates.”Norodien said working with De Sa again doesn’t mean he’ll just walk straight to the starting eleven.“I have to work hard like any other player in the team,” he said.“I’m sure Roger wanted me to come here because he knows that I’m a hard worker and a professional player.”Norodien said he loved the fighting spirit Stars players displayed in the two games, against Chippa and against Baroka.Norodien will be hoping to continue with his scoring form when Stars host SuperSport United in a league clash at Royal Bafokeng on Tuesday“This is our home game and we can’t afford to lose at home,” he said.“SuperSport are a good team and it will be tough match. But we can’t drop any more points. “We have to fight to win all games, which is possible in football.“But we’re aware it’s not going to be easy and we should take it one game at a time.Norodien told SunSport: “But the only thing that will help us to survive relegation is winning and nothing else.”Like this story?
