A DEMAND for buckets to store and reuse water during the drought has resulted in price increases!Cape Town bucket vendor Margaret Nqona (68) said buckets have become scarce because of high demand in recent months. They are being hoarded by people who stress over Day Zero, when the city’s taps are set to run dry.“We struggle to get buckets at industries where we normally buy them. Whenever we go there, they are out of stock. We used to buy a 65 -litre container for R80, but now it goes for R160. The increase was sudden and has made business difficult for us,” she said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssVSW4Szb-Xry-_4WWVvHeyWNUwMCFjTTxJyPZBqvRq7lcHWLhlcZluucyBdY6WBZUhKBnfpxKnL9QgTZ_AvahYKSkU3xzLwQQtJEsrSgGOacs6Z6YBS7UObsQVFR9Y1oieUdxGRqfMNURxGGMu_9ReG8-ipFBo-gXoJW9Ch2-GygelJMpVUD9TfTgXjuhKXFJshugVlILiEEhVTYYRwYCe7YPk6ZHppkyDE2whvBb9q6c3kI3qr_4dVYuq6kjt93zXzk6KxtzDyM4sphaOWVP5r3m8R2g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHDs_QL81Cp3EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It has been good business, because some buy five 65-litre buckets at once.” Lulama agreed that they are becoming scarce.“People are coming with bakkies to buy buckets. They are scared of Day Zero. It affects our livelihood. We can’t get enough buckets for those who want to buy. I usually buy 20 buckets to sell, but now get only five at a time.” Sakhiwe Thengani (32) said: “Many people now buy straight from suppliers.“It affects business badly because now they won’t buy from us.”Riyaaz Basra, who operates near Athlone, said demand had increased.“We sell buckets to vendors, but now private people buy directly from us.”
