The group accused of killing Chale first went to the police station before they returned to their kasi to look for him. They found Chale in his house with his two kids. The witness said Chale ran into her house but the group caught up with him.The defence discredited the witness’ testimony. It was later revealed that despite telling the court she only knew two of the suspects’ names, her earlier statement to police contradicted her testimony. Fourteen people have been accused of the murder.
