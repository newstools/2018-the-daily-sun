They were discovered by a passerby and police were summoned. Unfortunately one of the kidnapped victims passed on two days later after admittance at hospital and the other survived with serious injuries. Ironically, the three suspects were arrested at the compound of the local pastor,” said Mojapelo.The suspects are also members of a church which was accused of assaulting tavern patrons last year as they accused them of making noise. The church and the tavern operate next to each other, with only a fence separating them. Mojapelo said the Tactical Intelligence-led Operation comprising members from Crime Intelligence, Cluster Visible Policing, Public Order Police Service, the Tactical Response Team and Senwabarwana Detectives positively led to the arrest of three suspects aged between 23 and 28 for kidnapping, murder and attempted murder. Provincial police commissioner General Nneke Ledwaba warned members of the community not to take part in vigilantism. “We are aware about the accusations leveled against the local pastor by the local community. We urge all those affected in this incident to give us an opportunity to conduct proper investigations. “If anyone participates in acts of mob justice, they will be dealt with accordingly,” he said. Ledwaba emphasized that anyone who anticipates taking the law into their own hands will be dealt with accordingly,” he concluded. The suspects will appear in the Senwabarwana Magistrates Court soon.
