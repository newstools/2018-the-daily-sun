decision to the nation".At 21:00 on January 31, just hours before his deadline, Zuma
submitted representations to the NPA.The representations relate to a Supreme Court of Appeal
(SCA) ruling which dismissed Zuma's and the NPA's application to appeal a North
Gauteng High Court ruling that the dropping of the corruption charges against
him by then NPA boss Mokotedi Mpshe was "irrational".Mpshe dropped the charges, based on the so-called "Spy
Tapes", which were presented to him by Zuma's legal team.The tapes were made up of recordings of telephone
conversations between then Scorpions boss Leonard McCarthy and former NPA boss
Bulelani Ngcuka, which Zuma's legal team claimed showed political interference
in the decision to charge him.SOURCE: NEW24
