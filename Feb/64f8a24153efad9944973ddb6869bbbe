There are many closed factories around Mnquma while people are starving.“Unity is not something that you pronounce by mouth. Unity is something you practise. “In December the ANC held its national conference to vote for new leadership. “I competed with Nathi Mthethwa for the position of chairman. I won but it doesn’t mean Nathi and I shouldn’t work together.”Last year, Mnquma municipal manager Sindile Tantsi died, a month after being bust for his role in a R10 million tender for rubbish bags given to businessman Sive Nombembe. Nombembe died in a car accident.
