THE possibility of Steve Komphela leaving Kaizer Chiefs weighs heavy on the minds of his players.But it’s the very same players who could ensure Komphela’s survial as Chiefs head coach beyond the June expiry date on his contract. All they have to do is win a trophy or two. Amakhosi are in the running for league honours, though they appear to have a more realistic chance of success in the Nedbank Cup.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst055-AOArtT1fYXcflRK0NTq7whJuapDdLoY3eGXOB_zo-KWOaBa1mlqIjLgtzs3hZtYhdkO1l8xOwfM7ZdbaO0Gq_6q2IfzIZ0qsY7NkCzn6GxhLV1pvOihfFpHYbeMpg1Z_vTgu3NG3FwGOfUeZ0vZs0LRoliAEXM-4KFHcvNB_QmQrRn7ze7nUtEPMC3LBUh0-j4_tLqD886KMpb-gSTlRh9dgluIZ7bMZcI3sXuNAAmVFI_xx4Gq6autqM5MMulo7MaTIZLQB9Z_Qu8dPeuw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLDvIciaLzx7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It’s football, it’s business. When you are not doing well and it’s not working out, there’s nothing we can do,” said Tshabalala.“But we love our coach. We are working for him and we want him to stay. We believe he’s the right coach. The only thing we need is win trophies. “Winning silverware will definitely keep him here. He’s done well, giving youngsters opportunities, putting together a team able to compete. Sadly, he’s going to be judged on trophies. The only thing that’s left is for us to fight for him on the field to get silverware.”Tshabalala added that it would take consistency, hard work, courage, leadership and strong character for them to win the league.The midfield veteran is aware of the significance of their clash with the Citizens as the two of the top sides looking to remain in the title challenge.He added: “It’s going to be a tough game but a good one too. City love to play. We want to play too.“There are three points at stake. A draw is not good enough, defeat would be a huge setback. I don’t think City are coming here for a point. It’s like the last lap of the race, each point counts.”
