THE people living in Imizamo Yethu squatter camp in Hout Bay said the City of Cape Town has forgotten about them. There are just five toilets for over 200 people living there! The toilets are locked most of the time. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv2QmMWYP6vqtdK36xcgC-PLGHSrPXDnRTiFaFvHmjrq7i-fZLD1CgxogYjNGE7xiFWdZKNB03nAUT_CgW2rGvqR2v84U_C4J7LQmsOB-9LpYAtzUivpqLCBJ-9WJ0xTHkTpjbQsMovcCMOesCRtu7x1cx0ONjNuLcxbCh_SK7Z9Xn4HuTwrrlOfBQUstIWgSO2KexCB634nef5aFDpWou5fsP8AHFreDFI5IJiotJMfuDxqGxBKGdot23WC1HJQcS05VXAAcDaMCQxEahDty04_22Qt-o\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBSb3Iq9eP_wEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Mandla Nyalambisa (56), another resident, said some residents resort to locking some of the toilets.  They’re sick and tired of cleaning up after strangers. “Sometimes we share two toilets when the rest are locked,” he said.  They share a single tap. Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille’s spokeswoman Zara Nicholson said areas such as Imizamo Yethu had been identified for superblocking to improve the quality of residents’ lives.  “It creates space for roads and walkways so that water, electricity, refuse and sewage services can be provided within the superblocking project.  “Within each block between the roads and walkways, shared taps and ablution facilities can be provided, as well as electricity for each individual structure.  “Road access, electrification, firebreaks and fire hydrants will reduce fire risk.”  The 24-month project will apparently start once affected residents are temporarily moved.
