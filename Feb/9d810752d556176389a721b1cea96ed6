POLOKWANE City want to win the Limpopo derby against Baroka FC on Saturday in honour of their departed defender, Mogau Tshehla (26).It’s been a difficult week for the players, technical team and supporters after they laid to rest the key member of the team last Friday. Tshehla died in a car crash.Rise and Shine will play their first league match since the ceremony when they host bitter rivals Bakgaga at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm).if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstwXpFCbzdiVwJE8w96kUslGY5cJTkeiG3k_dQoQ9MfBAqJ56AE5ndFsg_Uug9hy_kx1xL6EwurAyZjJtz3k0geijFh7V1z6C0-fXxpRvfgpkTXe2yVejITtOo6XaI9pbiJUQxudVjgFDpAjsPQZG-eYKfQpUQmmjZ94lcmb1XNw5KaYtWb9y8GrbLMed-f5eDvJWa9hmZstmeboTBXjAeml2V_1KKWc06dic073K8FWdIg2w6vkVq-ZaWvnI2BYqABJTFRts5gKNURp91YAhIoZA\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YRYIAu0mR2zLYfN4ASBBRw7dp2Rw6AobXwIA-igo5qBpgubwDjkrd1ll10RdUailqNU8bJ9flj-C26_9sclddrAzhCNzRzBWdOEPaw7\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPmCEMOc_ZGUEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Said the 35-year-old: “We are among the relegation candidates now, which makes the match against Baroka an automatic six-pointer. "That is not all, we will also need to fight tooth and nail to collect points against Arrows, Platinum Stars and Bidvest Wits.” Rise and Shine will receive a timely boost with the return of Rodney Ramagalela and Rendani Ndou, who have both recovered from injury.Maluleke added that they would need to assist Ramagalela so he could score more goals, having hit the back of the net nine times this season. “But we will not put pressure on him if things are not going our way.”Like this story?
