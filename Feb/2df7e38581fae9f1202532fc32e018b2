No way! We are done with people who have no money,” Boity said.She elaborated by saying that she is done caring what people think about her, all she needs is a man who can match and even surpass her level.“I don’t care what anyone thinks or says but what do you think must happen when there’s no money? I cannot support the both of us. I think we’ve been through where it [money] didn’t matter but now it’s like, you need to level up,” she continued.
