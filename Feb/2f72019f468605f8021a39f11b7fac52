My messages of hope will bring change through the TV.He said whenever he is on TV, the channel’s ratings go up.“This is good for me and it is also good for ANN7. Their ratings will go up.”The pastor will be on air on Sundays between 8pm and 9pm.It is not known how long his show will run for though because ANN7’s contract with MultiChoice will end in August with no option to renew.
