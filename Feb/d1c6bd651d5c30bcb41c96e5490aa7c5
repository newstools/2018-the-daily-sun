They vowed not to stop until there was action from the department.After waiting in vain for officials from the department’s Moretele region to meet them at 8am on Monday, one angry parent told Daily Sun the department wasn’t taking them seriously. “The officials didn’t even send a message to say they wouldn’t be here. Now we are saying there won’t be any schooling until they tell us what they’re going to do about the school.”The parent said their kids are in danger and have to share chairs because so many of them are broken.“Until the department comes here, no child will enter a class.” Elias Malindi, the department’s spokesman, told Daily Sun a team of officials would visit the school today to assess the apparent damage.“This could only be done on Thursday. We urge parents to be patient with us. The visit will allow the department to see what speedy intervention can be put in place to resolve the matter.”
