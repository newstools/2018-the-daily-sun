It’s disturbing at times, but as professionals we have to try and focus on football,” he said. and focus on what’s happening on the field of play. The management has to sort things out quickly.” Madubanya said he had not seen or spoken to the coach since the incident. He said: “I’ve heard and also read in the papers about what he has allegedly done and that’s what I know.”You wish to stay in doors to avoid talking about such things as we really don’t know what happened. “It’s between the management and the coach, but somehow it affects the players. We just have to try and focus on our work.” Bakgaga started the season like a house on fire and even won the Quarter One in the Q-Innovation to bag R1.5 million in prize money.  but have lately battled for form and find themselves outside of the top eight.Madubanya said they would fight tooth and nail to secure a top eight finish. “Top eight is not far-fetched. That’s our target and we’ll achieve it,” he concluded.
