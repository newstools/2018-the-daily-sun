He didn’t pay me a cent.” Provincial Hawks spokesman Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo advised Bheka to go to the police. Daily Sun has seen documents stating Bheka is the owner of the company. The mayor admitted that he made his nephew owner of ZDN Trading Enterprise but denied promising to pay him 40%. He said he gave his nephew financial assistance while he was still studying.“I’m still prepared to help him if he comes back and talks to me,” said the mayor.ANC regional secretary Sindisiwe Msomi said the party regarded the issue as a family matter and won’t get involved.
