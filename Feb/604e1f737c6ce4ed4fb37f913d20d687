BIDVEST Wits’ new striker, Thobani Mncwango, aims to regain the form that saw him become the Absa Premiership’s second top scorer in the 2015-16 season.The 30-year-old proved a nightmare for opposition goalkeepers, scoring 13 goals that season, one behind Collins Mbesuma who won the top scorer award. Mncwango reckons having joined the Clever Boys is the first step towards resurrecting his ailing career after enduring a tough time at his former club, Polokwane City. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv4nz3qWqt0wuvmpbeS6jKnPY4DWlcWuNRxv9AAC3ZUsN-7CX-GXJ9ylXxc8yRCCK1VOUNs0VAtt63GrSDJ0y5uW5Pj5rFX_guLsY_HLbS18GjNSrVrZawKiSu4aSEP_TrSG2g4cuNeLldcs_a4cPnORfxrT_8GdNmSPysGDwoSLu_QEBtB_B7HctKOb-2NJaQlY2xTUZ2UxKDI6kigFctHadQ5iQWdmDDWROo2oq9VI7e5x3zfdHAzPOLD3F1OhUZnFekorpXu_HvDUw-U\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEa8isQLdg0aEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Then Wits came calling. He said: “I needed a new challenge and this is the right team for me. I had other offers but I chose to come to Wits because the club has quality players and a good coach (Gavin Hunt). I made the right decision, one I don’t regret. I am happy now.”However, Mncwango knows it won’t be easy to cement his place in Hunt’s starting lineup. He might get a run when Wits meet Golden Arrows in an Absa Premiership match at Princess Magogo Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm).“I still lack match fitness because it has been a long time since I last played. The training is hard compared to what I was used to at Polokwane. “My teammates and the technical staff understand my situation, that’s why they are pushing me – to help regain my form. I know why the management signed me, they saw me score goals two years ago. “But I don’t want to put myself under pressure. Once I’m settled goals will come.”Mncwango hails his granny and his former teammate, Puleng Tlolane, who has become his pillar of strength whenever he needs support.“My granny taught me to be strong and to always believe in prayer, even when life is unbearable. She told me to be patient and have faith in God because everything happens for a reason. The road has potholes and you need to tackle them head-on instead of running away. That’s why I didn’t force things when I was not playing at my former club. Tlolane, meanwhile, has been like a brother to me. He has motivated me to never give up. We shared deep secrets, as I never had parents for advice in Polokwane.”
