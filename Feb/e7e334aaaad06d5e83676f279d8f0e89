We resist burying our members," he told the House."I want to issue a strong warning. Any military engagement by the thugs engaging SAPS, there [will be] one side who gets buried after the engagement, and that side will not be the South African Police Service."A special task team countered the attack on Friday, killing seven suspects in a violent shootout at a church in the area.Cele paid homage to those who lost their lives in the attack."It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that we stand here and present the stories of young South African police officers that we lost at Ngcobo," he lamented."These were young and energetic members."Cele said the church would remain a "permanent crime scene" for the time being."For now, we have no church. It is a crime scene."If it [doesn’t] remain a church, it will perish as a criminal crime scene."'Behaving like animals'Cele raised the ire of some of the opposition MPs, most notably the Democratic Alliance, when he accused them of grandstanding during their responses to his speech."These are families in pain. The community is in pain, and even the police officers are in pain."Some time, you should go attend the funeral and be part of the pain that they feel… instead of behaving in the animal way you are," he charged."We do" and "we were the first ones there", some in the DA benches hit back.Cele finished his statement by praising the action of special task team involved in the shootout, and encouraged police officers not to hesitate to "sort things out the right way".New police minister #BhekiCele salutes the fallen #Ngcobo police officers during his first statement to Parliament as minister. He also warns criminals that SAPS is "not an undertaker business," and "thugs" attack officers at their own risk. @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/UMb4slHPTr— Paul Herman (@PaulHermanCPT) February 28, 2018https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ngcobo-massacre-five-suspects-have-confessed-says-cele-20180228
