According to close sources, the special relationship between the two turned sour after the warder did not give the offender his cash. “Arrangements were made by the two lovers that the warder would receive the offender’s money. All went well at first as the offender was also treated to nude photos of his girlfriend. But things turned bad when the warder didn’t give the offender his cash,” a source said.Daily Sun learned that the prison warder and a social worker were suspended last week. It is also understood that the offender had earlier reported the matter to the social worker who failed to report it to the relevant people and that’s why she was also suspended.Correctional services regional spokeswoman Tshidi Mapole said: “The department can confirm that it is investigating the alleged incident. “Two officials are on suspension pending the investigation. The offender will remain in prison at Klerksdorp Correctional Facility.”When asked if management had confiscated the photos, Mapole said: “Information related to the alleged incident cannot be discussed until the investigation is completed and the findings made known.”
