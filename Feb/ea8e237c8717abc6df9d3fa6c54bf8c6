A POINTS tally of 35 would please most PSL coaches at this stage of the season.But not so for Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane, whose team is not progressing as quickly as necessary to meet their target of taking the league title.Two seasons ago, the Brazilians hit a record 70-point mark as they cantered off with the league championship.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuz5cG7_VGyTGSbUWBAcmqa2XFqTfJkMtZ34kFYwpBAEcfsm4eLT6bUhBCk2xov_F3s-NcH99iUBjgrhM685s5oTjvCtTpShMj7EusJFv_S3h4B4DGl6JtvFtEC8jXugOgWFlSh3aU81xv6OegAja0ye9N5myhpXpt7pnJQgEB3-9Ebjuivwvl_fvlrft7CpCr3HWmLHOdn2yCOVXT5iC6zKQPgKZSyFCgrV_HEwln0nizmbwM1OZP3zmmvCb112UCzZt6_l3ErcI7hXnd7uUZrFA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBIA3J3wfrHPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We are seven points behind on our target. We have our own way of measuring progress, match by match. “Maybe we’ll have a good run of five games and get seven points, like we had in December. We overachieved that time.“But when you go to Polokwane City and lose and you also lose to Orlando Pirates – the points are gone. That’s the six points I’m talking about, plus the draw with Chiefs. It sets you back.”Part of the reason they have fallen behind on their target has been their low scoring rate, an aspect Mosimane has been working hard to sort out.To that end, the former Bafana Bafana coach has recruited marksmen Jeremy Brockie and Gaston Sirino, who are expected to feature against the Citizens at Cape Town Stadium tomorrow.“The ratio of converted goals to the number of chances created could be better,” Mosimane said.Yet City are also not banging in goals, as they face their own struggles up-front.But Benni McCarthy’s men always seem to save their best for Sundowns and won’t roll over for the visitors.Like this story?
