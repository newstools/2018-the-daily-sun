Cops spokesman Captain Bernard Matimulane said:  “The woman’s family got worried when she didn’t come home on Friday. They looked for her on the night of her disappearance but couldn’t find her. “They found the gogo on Saturday,” Matimulane told the People’s Paper.  “And it looked as if she had been strangled with her doek.”  He said the motive for the murder is  not known. He urged residents to work with cops so that whoever is responsible for killing the gogo faces the full might of the law.  Brigadier David Ngcobo, the station commander at Ivory Park cop shop, appealed to anyone with information to come forward with information.  He said a murder case has been opened.
