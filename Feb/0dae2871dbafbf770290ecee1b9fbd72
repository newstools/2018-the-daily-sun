In the video, councillor Ntanzi can be heard shouting at gogo Thandi.He later asked her why she was at the event. Gogo Thandi responded by saying she was not that hungry and told the councillor he was embarrassing her. The councillor then accused the gogo of stealing food last Christmas, and chased her away. The argument continued until another woman intervened.The mediator said in Zulu: “Let’s go, go Nyawo. “Just leave him alone.” Gogo Thandi said she decided to speak to the media about the incident because neither the police nor the municipality have taken action against the councillor. “I opened a case, but to this day nothing has been done,” said the gogo.She said she was reminded of her situation last week when suspended ANC branch secretary Thabiso Setona was filmed allegedly assaulting a gogo outside Luthuli House.The old woman was part of the Hands Off Zuma March organised by members of Black First Land First.“I am convinced Councillor Ntanzi would have kicked me too if I had not left,” she said.“I demand that he clear my name. “He swore at me and called me a thief, even though I have never stolen any food.”Umhlathuze Municipality spokesman Mdu Ncalane said the matter had not been brought to the council.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of crimen injuria was being investigated.
