We regard him as a fugitive because there is a warrant of arrest,” Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said.Accused 1, 2 and 3 (state officials) are granted R10 000 bail each. Accused 7, 8, 9 and 10 (Gupta-linked accused) get bail of R200 000. Vasram's (accused number 5) address must still be confirmed and is therefore stood down.Kamal Vasram's case has been postponed to Monday. #GuptaCourt @TeamNews24— Jeanette Chabalala (@J_chabalala) February 15, 2018The State versus 11 accused, including Oakbay Investments- NEWS24
