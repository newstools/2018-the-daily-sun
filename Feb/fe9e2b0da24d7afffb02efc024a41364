But we know that NFD teams run a lot and to stop them you just can’t allow them to have the ball. "I will play my normal first team – maybe I will start with one or two players who are subs.” Despite being on the wrong end of the Absa Premiership table, Molekwa says City are taking the Nedbank Cup seriously and want to go as far as possible.Rise and Shine are 13th in the standings with 22 points from 20 matches. They are equal on points with 14th placed Bidvest Wits. And Molekwa admits that they are not yet safe from relegation. Many people thought City’s focus would be on survival rather than winning the Ke Yona Cup.“We know we are still in danger in the league,” he said. “But we’re taking this competition very seriously. It will be good for the team to progress. The PSL is our first priority and we will do all we can to move away from the relegation zone. But it will also be good to try and challenge for the Nedbank Cup.” If Molekwa sticks to his plan, Ubuntu youngsters will face the likes of Jabu Maluleke, Walter Musona and current leading PSL goal-scorer Rodney Ramagalela. But City’s defence will need to guard against Ubuntu striker Ranga Chivaviro, who has already scored nine goals this season.
