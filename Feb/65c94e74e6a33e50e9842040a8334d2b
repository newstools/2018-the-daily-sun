Mokete said he had been to many pastors and sangomas with no success until he met Prophet Paul Mpobolo two weeks ago. Mpobolo claimed he had been bewitched by someone close to the family and an evil snake was following them around.Mpobolo brought his congregation from his church in Sebokeng zone 10 to drive out the huge snake he claimed was destroying the Koloi family. The prophet instructed two of his followers to fetch Mokete’s wardrobe. According to witnesses, he gave a precise description of where the wardrobe was despite never having been inside the family’s shack.Less than five minutes later, a python was discovered in the shack and brought out. It was locked in the wardrobe, which was then set alight. Mokete told Daily Sun: “My life has been falling apart for years. I even went to Lesotho to see sangomas. The last time I went to one, he gave me muthi to drink and I vomited snake skin.” He said before he met the prophet, he would often hear banging sounds in his house when there was no one around. “I believe that now that the snake has been found, I will live a happy life with my wife and kids.” Malebala said the kids once told her and Mokete they had seen a snake on their bed. “We searched for it but never found it. Sometimes we would see shadows moving in the house but no one else saw them,” she said. Prophet Mpobolo told the family the snake would sometimes turn into a human, which was why they saw shadows.
