this happened under my watch and I am totally committed to taking corrective
and remedial action to ensure that this never happens again," said
Makhura.Speaking at the State of the Province Address, Makhura said

several NGOs, some of which were not registered, exposed deep institutional
problems within the country's public health system and public service in

quality of care for millions of people who depend on the public health system."The people of Gauteng, I would like to reiterate that
the deaths of 144 Life Esidimeni mental health patients is a tragedy that has
left deep wounds and pain in the collective memory of our democratic nation. It
is something that should have never happened and should never happen again."The Gauteng provincial government had budgeted enough
money for mental healthcare services. I would like to reiterate that the
transfer of mental healthcare patients to ill-equipped and unlawfully operating
NGOs was never approved by myself or the Gauteng executive council."Corrective and remedial action to be takenMakhura said he would take full responsibility for the
tragedy."As the head of government in the province I have taken
full responsibility and accountability for this tragic loss of life of our
fellow citizens. I cannot pass the buck. I am the premier of this province. The
buck stops with me. I take responsibility for anything that goes wrong in the
administration I lead. I must face the people and fix the problem."He said he had made a commitment to work with the families
to ensure that those who are criminally liable are prosecuted."We keenly await the outcomes of the alternative
dispute resolution process led by retired deputy chief justice Dikgang
Moseneke."I am absolutely determined to speedily implement the
outcomes of the ADR [alternative dispute resolution] process in order to ensure
redress, justice and closure for the affected families."After consultation with the family committee, I will
appoint an independent curator who will ensure that all the decisions of
retired deputy chief justice Moseneke are implemented."Makhura said a caring nation was one that took good care of
its most vulnerable citizens."In April this year I will appoint a panel of experts
and civil society representatives who will review our work in caring for the
most vulnerable in society â€“ people with mental illness, the elderly, people
with disabilities and children," said Makhura.SOURCE: NEWS24
