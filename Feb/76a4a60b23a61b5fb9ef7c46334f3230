Together they were honoured with awards of the "Best Rescuing Dog" in the Eastern Cape for three consecutive years – the year 2014, 2015 and 2016.Constable Katikati said Olive went missing after rescuing a 55-year-old man who was missing since Friday, after he had gone to fetch woods at a nearby forest, and struggled to find his way back home.Olive was allegedly chased by other dogs in the forest.Constable Katikati said: “Olive is my best friend and companion. He is humble and he cannot harm anyone as he is trained in rescuing drowned people, seeking missing people and seeking evidence on other crime scenes. I plead with anyone who sees him to not harm him but rather keep him and report to the police."Acting Cluster Commander, Brigadier Nomawethu Makonza  said: "Olive is our member that never disappointed us. When we send Constable Katikati and Olive to rescue someone we relax and stay assured that they'll bring that missing person back to his/her family. It is therefore disturbing news to our Cluster and other Clusters to hear that he is missing. Our members have since been out there searching for him.”Olive is tan in colour with his black back and face. He has a black leather belt with clock around his neck.Police in Mthatha are urging anyone who might see him or know of his whereabouts to please contact Constable Katikati on 07273101556 or 0835303295.  Information can also be shared on SAPS Crime Stop 08600 10111 or Crime Line 32211.  1/4
