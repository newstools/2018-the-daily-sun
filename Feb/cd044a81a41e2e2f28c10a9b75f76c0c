DURING the day, these two friends love to entertain passengers at taxi ranks while they wait for taxis to fill up. In the afternoons, they join in the community choir’s singing. Their velvet voices soothe passengers as they sing gospel and love songs. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssBP_Y1sgT6LquMzpJSnB3gh1dthbpS6_Sy64lKInuHu0_Q_qPliDJA0DAlWboDb2Oe5OXOwxisBw4D5-YGSSQJWokbk9KaK7o1N5rHukTzxw9iBEMtgbGsA3fapXROMRgDDu4JS7Sr87xqZ4Zj6T3fQ1PwRCq3EVsuwxRqHIiLNOHtO4iWoswg3HnIjZKKmXvf7oOwMwwbML3r7JmqCGXeesY2MpQI3B70ZCmoHGlCgYO9a3uMTNcxu6T-fBjiYvD0A-WI5-1_aghUpfdKWanvPfA44mw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA4hCjkzL7ReEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The two, whose biggest wish is to record an album one day, said they wake up early every morning and go to the taxi rank to play music and sing. Emmanuel told Daily Sun: “Making music for passengers earns us our daily bread and we love it. Passengers love our music and always beg for more. “They donate money that helps us support our families. “I am using the guitar skills my father taught me. “I met my friend Thabiso at school and that is when we started singing together.”Thabiso said he plays the trumpet, which he learned at church, to make their music special. “Music is in our blood and we enjoy entertaining people. “After we completed matric in 2013, we both did a course in diesel mechanics.” But they both decided to follow their hearts and sing. “When I’m playing the trumpet, I always imagine myself as the next Bra Hugh Masekela. I can also play the guitar because my friend taught me.” Emmanuel and Thabiso said they started singing at Bosman and Marabastad taxi ranks in Tshwane before coming back home in 2016. They wish their talent would be recognised and that a recognised record label would sign them.Julia Mahlangu (34) and Sipho Mnyakeni (29) said the two friends have talent and will go far. “Their singing always keeps us entertained while we wait for taxis to fill up.“We really enjoy what they’re doing.”
