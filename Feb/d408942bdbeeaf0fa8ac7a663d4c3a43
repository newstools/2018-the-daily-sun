BIDVEST Wits will put their Nedbank Cup setback behind them to focus on their African Champions League preliminary round match against Pamplemousses at the Milpark Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). But Hunt, whose side lost 1-0 to Benni McCarthy’s Cape Town City to be knocked out of the Ke Yona cup, stressed that the Mauritian side was a closed book to them.“We will make one or two changes for the right reasons. I don’t even know what colours they are playing in. I have no idea, there is nothing we know about them.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Wits will be without key defender Sifiso Hlanti, who suffered a head injury after colliding with the Citizens’ Craig Martin. Keegan Ritchie who joined them from SuperSport United in January, replaces him. Explained Hunt: “Hlanti’s injury is bad. His whole eye is bashed. Keegan will play on Saturday, we need to give him a game.”He is concerned that his players will now have time to loaf around after their cup exit.“I told them that the Nedbank Cup always keeps your season going. We’ve got weekends free now and that’s disappointing. The league is obviously the big focus right now (avoiding relegation), but winning the cup is always good,” explained the coach. ) Meanwhile, McCarthy’s City will have had no time to rest as they’ve jetted to Swaziland for their Confederation Cup match against the Young Buffaloes on Saturday.“I am not a dictator,” said McCarthy. “I give my players the freedom to enjoy football. I want them to remember why they play the game.”The Bafana legend is excited that he is on track to win his first domestic trophy as head coach, having missed out on the MTN8 Cup when they lost to SuperSport in the final. Said McCarthy: “The best part was being back on the bench (following his suspension).”
