She said once you hear that someone in the industry has died, a week is too long before you hear that someone else has followed.“We live in fear of who will be next.”She said they thought they needed to pray as a collective.“Maybe, if we come to God together, He’ll hear our cries,” she said.She said they were contacted by Bishop Ramela, who told them he’d had a terrifying vision and that they needed to pray together as soon as possible.“The Archbishop came at the right time as we were also feeling the need for this,” said Deborah.She said the who’s who in showbiz had already confirmed their attendance.“We will have the likes of mama Dorothy Masuku, Abigail Kubheka, Sipho Makhabane and many more joining us,” she said. She said actors and actresses will be there too. “Even political leaders have agreed to join us,” she said.She said together, they want to show God that they are humble in front of him and that they’re willing to listen to his instructions. “We are a very small family in this industry. When we lose one of us, it hurts,” she said. Archbishop Ramela said they would pray and were sure God would hear them.Said Archbishop Ramela: “God spoke to me and said we needed to dedicate a prayer to all people in the local entertainment industry because of their challenges and death that haunts them.”He said they would be asking God to protect them and forgive their sins.
