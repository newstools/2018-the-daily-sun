Thakeng told Daily Sun a passerby found the woman’s naked body at 6am next to the Eskom power station in K9 section. Thakeng cops started investigating after they received a tip-off from the suspect’s mum that afternoon.“She reported the blood on her son’s pants, which led to the first arrest. On Monday, people said two suspects were leaving Kutlwanong in a car. “Three people were arrested by the Welkom flying squad on the R70. The car driver was charged with defeating the ends of justice and his vehicle was seized. A woman was bust after she allegedly let the suspects sleep at her house before they tried to flee and was also charged.” Thakeng said on Tuesday, a fourth rape and murder suspect was arrested. “All the suspects will appear before the Odendaalsrus Magistrates Court.”Major-General Lerato Molale thanked Kutlwanong residents.
