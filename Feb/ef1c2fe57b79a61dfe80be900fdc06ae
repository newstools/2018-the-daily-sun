There were flies hovering over the food,” she said. “We have lost businesses that our families depended on. We’ve decided to take the rubbish where the problem originates from.”Last week, the People’s Paper reported that Eastern Cape Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Fikile Xasa visited the municipality to hear the workers’ grievances. Among their complaints was that their municipal manager was improperly appointed. They also complained of corruption in the municipality.Samwu Eastern Cape deputy chair Lebo Mangaung said union members had opened seven cases of fraud and corruption. “The MEC gave the council seven days to deal with our concerns but nothing has been done. “The leaders are nowhere to be found. We want the council to be dissolved and elections to be run again,” said Mangaung. MEC Xasa’s spokesman Mamkeli Ngam said a team from the department was dealing with the allegations. He said they were yet to receive a response from mayor Lindelwa Rolobile about the department’s intention to intervene in the matter. Rolobile said the workers’ issues were being resolved.
