SELLO Chokoe’s Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and Simo Dladla’s Real Kings are proof that you don’t necessarily need experience to make an impact in the National First Division (NFD).When the going gets tough in the NFD most coaches are quick to blame a lack of senior or experienced players. But Chokoe and Dladla do not hesitate in throwing their youngsters in at the deep end, as they believe fresh blood is also crucial – and this approach seems to be working miracles for them. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuyk1xvNcR3T1hkx74TLOHo87XFt5EzA816R64L1utmiiB810LaqutEPcwJ7HwMvLvzoKbAVPxmyddW7_ysQ6gLmN9_UlhL34K8ejqOlwSdf5encyNAFE0zkY5kA9CDpTOCkZ-57f0VMv5_rp3mQ63WiirtLY28RUk4kzk-_-9hT_enVKVndd_K3VJk54TnnsGzuf7kr0HO6wOMAmAH8vsjWxTsGGptOW9z0dH92rfWfbIrf4y3_9UIbpl10ehBpZzlye0VKn0u6NgKyb0jTepPIw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHNmN-19mb-iEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

These two teams have proven that sometimes, patience is key.After 19 league matches, Kings are second in the NFD table with 31 points and Tshakhuma are in fourth place with 30 points – equal on points with Jomo Cosmos who lie third due to a better goal difference.Chokoe’s experience seems to be working woners at the Venda outfit as Tshakuma have only lost five games so far. The inexperienced Tshakuma squad has been outsmarting seasoned campaigners in the league and has not lost a match to any of the so-called big teams in the NFD.Talking to SunSport yesterday Chokoe said one of the reasons why they have been doing well was because his players are hungry.“The club does not have big stars, all of these boys want to showcase their talent. “They are driven by hunger and dedication,” stated Chokoe.They have even done better than their Limpopo rivals Black Leopards, who once plied their trade in the Absa Premiership. He added: “It has not been an easy campaign, but my experience and knowing most of the teams because I have coached at many of them have made things a bit easier for us in our approach of the games.“The plan is to continue working hard. A top three finish would be a bonus.”The former Baroka FC mentor was full of praise for Varsity Football graduate Themba Ndlovu, who has scored four goals in seven matches. Ndlovu joined Tshakhuma in December.
