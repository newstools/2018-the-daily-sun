Malusi Gigaba will be delivering his maiden budget speech on Wednesday in the

appointed to head National Treasury after former President Jacob Zuma’s Cabinet

are particularly interested in the National Budget deficit which is currently estimated  4.3%, while the 2017 Budget had a deficit
estimated at 3.1% of GDP.“We believe
measures to restore public trust in government in general and the South African
Revenue Service (SARS) in particular are essential to improving tax compliance
and thereby tax buoyancy, which has deteriorated significantly over the past
three years,” Minister Gigaba said previously.Meanwhile,
in December, Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) announced that the country’s
GDP grew by 2% in the third quarter of 2017.
