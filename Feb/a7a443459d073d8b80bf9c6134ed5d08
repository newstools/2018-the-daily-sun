They said he stepped on live wires while picking herbs in the bush at Saunders Circle.They said a few weeks ago, another man (33) was electrocuted when he stepped on a live wire while trying to get out of his bakkie that had overturned.They were still reeling from shock following the death of a three-year-old child who was electrocuted on Ocean Drive last month. Thabo Mthembu (31) said: “The municipality has to do something. “Some people from squatter camps around here have no electricity. “They connect from the electricity boxes in the streets and the live wires are lying all over the place.” Ward 62 Councillor Zanele Khumalo said some squatters had no electricity and illegal connections were common.“The challenge is that some pieces of land in this area are privately owned.“Electrification can’t take place before the land owner’s permission has been obtained.” Tozi Mthethwa, eThekwini municipal spokeswoman, said the municipality regularly conducted power cuts in various parts of Durban where there were izinyoka connections. She said the municipality is often criticised when someone is electrocuted by a live wire.“When the matter is investigated, officials discover the illegal connection was never reported so we couldn’t act to prevent fatalities. “The scourge of illegal electricity connections has been a challenge despite several interventions.”She urged residents to report illegal connections to avoid fatalities.
