UNEMPLOYED teachers in KZN have given the education MEC 10 days to give them jobs or face a total shutdown of his office.The group of about 100 teaching graduates took to the streets in Durban on Monday to demand jobs from MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane. They marched down Dr Pixley kaSeme Street to hand over their memorandum of demands. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Mxolisi Mthalane, who organised the march, said they were no longer asking for jobs but demanding them. “Where must we work? We are being given bursaries to go to university to study but after finishing our courses, we sit at home and do nothing. “There is a lot of nepotism in the department so we want the MEC to tell us what he has done about it.” Mxolisi said teachers’ unions have told them schools are overcrowded and don’t have enough teachers. He said the department gives jobs to people who pay for them. He said they decided to march because it was normal practice in Mzansi to take to the streets to make their voices heard.Mxolisi said they felt undermined by the MEC, who didn’t bother to accept their memorandum. He said the memorandum was accepted by an eThekwini municipal official who promised to hand it over to the MEC.Kwazi Mthethwa, KZN Department of Education spokesman, said the MEC was aware there were graduates still sitting at home. He said there was nothing the department could do because there was no money to employ more teachers. “We wish we could employ them because there are spaces available but our problem is that we have budgetary constraints. If they have information about nepotism they must come forward with evidence,” said Mthethwa.
