We’ve spoken to the councillor and sent a petition to the Joburg Road Agency, but our cries seem to fall on deaf ears.” Elizabeth said they even protested, but nothing happened.Councillor Meisie Maluleke said the roads agency did not take residents seriously. Bertha Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the roads agency, said she’d look into the petition once she has received the petition number. “I will then forward it to the relevant people.”
