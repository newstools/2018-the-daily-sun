Wear the right underwearCotton seems like the obvious fabric choice, but Dr Collyer says it might magnify any already persistent perspiration problems.“Cotton is not great for ventilation,” he points out. “Though, boxer briefs and boxers tend to be better than briefs for ventilation.” So, avoid briefs if you insist on cotton.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>If you want the best sweat-wicking, anti-microbial fabric, then Dr Collyer suggests microfibre.“It tends to breathe well, and any mesh areas in the groin will keep air moving through.”In other words, no accumulation of moisture, and it’s an unfavourable environment for bacteria that’s favourable for you.Consider starting the day with powderA moisture-absorbing powder will keep your nether region dry throughout the day, thus preventing the sweat accumulation that leads to infections, odour and chafing.And you’ve got two main choices: talcum or starch-based.“Talcum-based products tend to work longer against perspiration than corn starch-based products,” Dr Collyer says. He suggests finding a powder with antifungal properties, too.Never let sweat lingerThis is obvious, but still necessary: “Always shower after workouts,” Dr Collyer says. “Don’t sit in sweaty clothing and always wear clean underwear.”Lots of infections are caused by the bacteria nesting inside your underwear or gym shorts, and you should minimise the time they spend on your body, since the bacteria can multiply and migrate quickly.Wash with moisturising bar soapDr Collyer says to avoid exfoliators, scrub brushes and loofahs when showering, because they can irritate the skin – and the testicle skin is sensitive.“Use a standard, nourishing bar soap,” he says. He always tells his patients to stick with Dove, since it moisturises while also killing germs.And keep everything trimmed… but not too trimmedThere are hygienic benefits to trimming your balls.“Hair can harbour odour and some different forms of bacteria,” Dr Collyer says. “However, pubic hair also helps decrease friction,” so you should leave some hair, even if you’re going to trim it shorter.Leave anything from a centimetre to an inch if you want a trim-but-not-too-trim result.Don’t use anything besides an electric trimmer on your junk, and avoid putting it right on the skin, since it’s easy to get nicks and to experience irritation on the thin skin.SOURCE: Health24
