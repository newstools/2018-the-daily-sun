When my friends and I visited his home in Pimville, Soweto, he would sit and listen to our conversations.“After watching his favourite TV programmes he would quietly leave us and go to sleep.” His friend Andy Chabedi said Bra Eddie was among the men who joined the Ipi Ntombi show in the early 70s. Andy said they formed theatre groups in high school and entertained people with their breathtaking dramas.Rhythm City actor Setlhabi “Bra Kop” Taunyane said he met Bra Eddie during their Ipi Ntombi days. “He was among the people who mentored me. He wasn’t jealous and helped me do my best although I was the youngest of the group,” he said.Neighbour Lebo Mataboge said Bra Eddie loved his family. Colleague Jerry Mofokeng said Bra Eddie has made his big exit. “Death has robbed not only the Mokoena family but also the country and the arts industry at large.” Producer Ziyanda Mngomezulu said Bra Eddie has left a hole no one could fill.
