It appears
Minister of Human Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu made a gaffe when she said in the
National Assembly on Monday that veteran journalist Peter Ndoro has lost his
job after he mistakenly announced on national TV that President Cyril Ramaphosa
had died.SABC
spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago denied Sisulu's claim and said he was shocked that
she made such an announcement in Parliament."We
have never issued any statement to that effectâ€¦ Rest means rest."if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsve_xrtarNrFzU-dYHeG4WxrWWAJSf9Dk74d_sWjAHDzxGZo4whPg88TnOrYhOzU0kwIk4R8YHtZpirXQW9pewcZ52fZGkHFiIGqv5SsDMMkiRexmDgKFUNqFB-CRdy0EQ_KAQ4f2STcvQoKPGP7bKF9WN4NtGXFLYPsUV_cnDhX4SXO2q4-HKsjqdBNQfANSM4jG6FRWrlEVa0w5gCAeHVt4wXVCLmBu12jxnpv7HfohaObLyc54wlcBdhJlE4yFvXG3glVlnYkiQuahAF0nfCsoD1mvI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHw79leCjxzIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

State of the Nation debate on Monday morning, Sisulu said a request had come to
her to convey to Ramaphosa that journalists covering the change in African
National Congress government had "suffered overwhelming fatigue"."We
have learnt with regret that Ndoro has lost his job."Sisulu then
asked Ramaphosa to stand up and assure the country that he was still alive and
had forgiven Ndoro for the error.Ramaphosa,
who was visibly shocked by the announcement, did as requested before waving and
laughing."He is
an outstanding representative of this country," she said about Ndoro.MPs were
also shocked at the news.But Speaker
Baleka Mbete, in an attempt to bring order, told Sisulu: "People hadn't
gotten the news about Ndoro, so there is a bit of confusion."Responding,
Sisulu apologised and said that she was conveying to the president about
concerns that the ruling party has kept the media on their toes.In a
statement released on Friday, Kganyago said the SABC had spoken to Ndoro after
the blunder and that he was fatigued and needed rest."Management
has agreed to his request and he will be taking a break from the show. Ndoro
has apologised to the president and his apology has been accepted,"
Kganyago said at the time.The
broadcaster's newly appointed Chief Operations Officer Chris Maroleng turned to
Twitter to confirm that Ndoro had not been sacked.SOURCE: NEWS24
