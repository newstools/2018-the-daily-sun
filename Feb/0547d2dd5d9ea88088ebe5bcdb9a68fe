the man didn’t stop farting which disgusted his seatmates, who then report the
matter to the airline crew.The crew
instead did nothing to address the issue of the farting man.Meanwhile,
the captain issued a warning to the two complainants, and accused them of being
noisy and aggressive.The pilots
then made an emergency stop in Vienna and removed the complainants but the
farting man was not removed off the plane.
