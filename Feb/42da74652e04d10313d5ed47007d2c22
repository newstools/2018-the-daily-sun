His boss apparently told him that he couldn’t work with a person who didn’t have an ID. Enock claimed his ID was stolen by his roommate who had used it to withdraw money from his bank account. “I wanted to go to the bank to investigate and that is when I noticed my ID was missing. I went to Home Affairs to apply for a new ID but I was told I could no longer use my old ID number as it had been blocked. “I was advised to bring an affidavit stating that I’d lost my ID, and my birth certificate. I did all that and went to the offices in Witbank to reapply. I was told to come back after two weeks,” he said.Enock said he went back after two weeks only to be told to go to KwaMhlanga. “Instead of being assisted there, the officials sent me from pillar to post, telling me that they didn’t understand Swati. They said I should address them in Sotho or Ndebele.” Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the matter would be referred to the provincial manager, who would call Enock.
