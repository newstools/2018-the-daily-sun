NO competition is high – or low – on the list of priorities for Gavin Hunt.The Bidvest Wits coach has drawn plenty of attention with his team’s shocking league campaign, a poor run that has overshadowed their cup success this season.But there are preferences for Hunt, who insists that every game will receive the same amount of attention in their hectic schedule involving three competitions.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstKDrQwOAgjDFO1x-SH2Ank5o6JcIJ7Nw7PnGWBmBPppusRy6VfyOrORt7thAnAavVu18aHSv4Y6elCRH8FvWQ5BAIB333Ivw5H5BCuQSAG1i_HuAmv9qDia9tLFYTaQLp7Co37AmOESrOLmn6xwk__xn3dYhG5YmVnJnSwFup5A50YnctajDeHDaTdR-_sVxdYebzPPcwZakvUZr39ZPK2jg_dRd-1X_d8YJpUhHVuWfYbawTe9ltUtHVgGr1b1vuNl8-l8jZ2kZbC9sq7wcBk_w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFAgmHVfgZbKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We have to approach every game as the most important one,” said Hunt.“Obviously we have to be careful with the squad here and there. But I don’t do something to be nice – we play to win.“We need to win tomorrow, we need to win on Saturday and next week. As I’ve said to the team, we need to remain unbeaten until the end of the year. If we do that we will be good on all fronts. We will be up in the league and in the group stages.”Hunt acknowledges that his squad could be stretched by the heavy schedule, particularly in key defensive positions. But he will always “make a plan” – blessed as he is with versatile players – just like he did against Kaizer Chiefs in their last match.City present a different challenge, though,with the timely return of coach Benni McCarthy from suspension. McCarthy has outwitted his master Hunt on three occasions so far this season, making the upcoming clash more exciting.“They were very unfortunate against Sundowns,” Hunt said. “We struggled against City last season, this season. They have quality. They have already been to a cup final this season, changed their squad a bit and the changes have worked for them.”
