WHEN his mum was still alive, Dumisani Tshabangu would always win his fights with her. However, these days she’s getting her revenge from beyond the grave. The 54-year-old from White City in Soweto told Daily Sun he regretted disrespecting his mum when she told him to stop associating with the wrong crowd. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssD2cPEF20PN9vp8RCfbQB-k1_n3fSIgrL7UQ7pnbg4JH7UVKnHXE4PDp0x78vD5rkEiirBvR6UM-szaoVBY2DjTiSS-gNUMnbgitApbdvAK4wBxYPz8FOE4jieHE84qX_EgNQ9yEsqztMocKYGssDCiKEm3yuLKORdAbLYbVGctCyMIR7qO6Zi0NypPdXZwY7mESKUV76SNV_lzqrQ0-SF4JwPsTgTRLt2hxRZXkyEReQIaweyPrb4xOYPMk7UNfFrYjRtOKLTpSzgxPg7QJ2aUV3n8sU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNPPeO--J72-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They were terrorising innocent people, robbing and beating them,” he said. Dumisani said he ended up paying a heavy price for not listening to his mum. “I’ve been arrested more than nine times and I’ve served five prison sentences,” he said. He said he tried to apologise to his mum’s spirit after she died about 10 years ago with no success. “Going to her grave and apologising has not helped me. I’ve done that several times,” he said. Dumisani said he was arrested for the first time in 1981 for theft and sentenced to six years in prison. Just a few months after he was released, he was sentenced to three years for housebreaking. In 1990, he was sentenced to four years for kidnapping and in 1995, he was arrested for assault, robbery and kidnapping. “While I slept in my prison cell, my mum used to come to me and tell me she was angry with me for disrespecting her,” he said. “I spent most of my time in jail crying, trying to figure out how to apologise to her. I’ve been to sangomas but all they tell me is that I need to apologise to my mum.”He said he was even unlucky in love.“I’ve lost so many girls I loved because I fight with them. Sangomas say my mum chases them away. “I need help!”
