misconduct at Eskom.Madonsela discovered how the Gupta business family, allegedly
arranged the 2015 appointment of Brian Molefe as Eskom chief to line up profitable
contracts.Officials and former workers appearing before a parliament
hearing in recent weeks have made surprising revelations of how Eskom
executives helped the Gupta family benefit from favourable deals.In one case, Eskom paid more than $49m to a Gupta-owned
mining firm Tegeta to help it buy a coal mine from Glencore, the Guptas would
then sell the coal to Eskom.Former Eskom chairman Zola Tsotsi told lawmakers how one of
the Gupta's three brothers, Tony, summoned him to a meeting and threatened him
with dismissal because he was not "helping" them.
