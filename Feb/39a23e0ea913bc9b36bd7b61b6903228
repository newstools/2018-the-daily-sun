BAROKA coach Kgoloko Thobejane’s future with the club is uncertain.This comes after he was suspended last week after allegations that he consumed alcohol with senior players and members of his technical staff. The incident allegedly occurred on a bus on their way home to Polokwane following Baroka’s 2-0 defeat to Free State Stars in an Absa Premiership match at Goble Park a fortnight ago.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>SunSport has reliably learnt the others suspended due to the allegations are goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke and captain Olaleng Shaku, along  with kit manager Delbert Lekoana and assistant goalkeeper trainer Tshegofatso Machene.Although Thobejane confirmed his suspension to SunSport, he denied consuming alcohol on duty. “Yes, I am suspended and I do not know why,” he said. “I heard the stories that we were drinking, but that’s not true.  I take my job very seriously and will never mix it with alcohol.”Thobejane revealed that the management knows why he was suspended.“The right people to tell you why I am suspended are the club’s management. I don’t even know when my case will be heard. I am waiting to hear from management.”He confirmed he won’t be on the bench when Baroka tackle fellow strugglers Platinum Stars in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 at Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Wednesday (7.30pm). It’s not yet clear whether technical director Doctor Khumalo or assistant coach Macdonald Makhubedu will be in charge during his absence. “I will not be part of matters when the team plays against Platinum Stars on Wednesday. I don’t know whether others who were suspended will be available for the match. The management can tell you.”This is not the first time Thobejane has been suspended by the management. Last season he was suspended due to poor results, but the club recalled him when the team started sinking deeper into the relegation zone. Baroka are currently ninth with 26 points.Meanwhile, an insider at the club told SunSport that Baroka team manager Lawrence Okwara parted ways with the Limpopo club two weeks ago. Baroka CEO Morgan Mammila was not available for comment.Like this story?
