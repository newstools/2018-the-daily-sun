WHEN his friends teased him that he couldn’t swim, he felt very embarrassed.  The 25-year-old man apparently told them he could swim across the dam and back if he wanted to.  He took a drag on his cigarette, undressed, and jumped into the water!  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvrkeh6DViVKnEs8isxPvjIbgEb8RsLWGbdft_bZzS7byK0dT9sMxsdo6ojQdcwjUL23TcY497b7czAxSmyNO6bHs91I0v2qgrGsh7uoyebeDGTw4Z0N2HGCIM3Ux4Xm26NDwECaubD7HOYl_OW573RoLkeAKgOsFSx58wXix_hd4-YXGB5gPEgxO6WTHxE8Cksq8trcanZG5h0zNZdj1H1cpTIorA-PJxpU2g6vMR9CYp4s-Oh6EFpiybIrU1HDvlcje_SxwsIM_JKZ5Q83EgGjLfkb3g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCrBfBtFQfJQEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It happened in Groenfontein in Heidelberg, Ekurhuleni, on Saturday.  As a result, his worried friends panicked and looked for him in the dam. They finally gave up and  his brother reported the incident to the man’s employer, who called the police.  Paramedics and divers were called to the scene and the man’s body was retrieved from the dam.  One of his friends said they would always come to the dam to hang out whenever they were off duty.  “We’d always swim but he never did,” he said.  “We didn’t know he couldn’t swim. Had we known, we’d have taught him.” The friend said it was their fault that the man had died.  “Had we not teased him, he would still be alive today,” he told the People’s Paper.  Heidelberg police spokesman Captain Thivhulawi Tshilate said cops have opened an inquest docket.
