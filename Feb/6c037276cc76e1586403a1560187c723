Said Samaai: “I’m happy I made the team, but I’m not surprised by this. It’s a good opportunity to showcase my talent on the world stage again. I just want to go out there and give it my all. I know I have the potential to be the best in the world.”But bronze medal is not the colour Samaai wants to bring home this time around. Meanwhile, all eyes will also be on SA sprint ace Akani Simbine to collect his first world major medal in the absence of injured Wayde van Niekerk.Simbine told SunSport: “Everyone expects me to step up and I have set myself the same goal. I want to run fast and get a silver or gold medal.”Like this story?
