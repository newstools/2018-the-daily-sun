February 2014 on the M1 in Gauteng, where the passenger of the other vehicle,
Melekina Dube, died on impact.AfriForum’s Private Prosecuting Unit head Gerrie Nel sent
a letter on behalf of the Dube family to the NPA late last year to push for
prosecution against Duduzane.“AfriForum cornered Abrahams,” Kriel said. “If he again decides not to prosecute Zuma Jr., he knows
that Gerrie Nel is ready to continue with private prosecution. “However, if he decides to do his job and prosecute Zuma
Jr., it will be a victory for Dube’s family, AfriForum and equality before the
law,” he added.Kriel also said that Nel might apply more pressure on
Abrahams, this time to prosecute former president Jacob Zuma.“Abrahams knows that, if he decides not to prosecute
Jacob Zuma, Nel is ready to privately prosecute the former President.“Hopefully, this will force him to do the right thing by
deciding that the NPA must prosecute Zuma.”
