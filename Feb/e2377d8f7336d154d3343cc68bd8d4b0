FINANCE
Minister, Malusi Gigaba, tabled the 2018/2019 budget speech and highlighted on how
the country's funds will be spent. He
pointed out that extraordinary measures have to be taken in order to stabilise
the public finances. "Without
such measures, we would only delay the debt estimate, and a growing share of
spending would be absorbed by interest payments," he saidif(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsutJ8mbY1knasFlJnScVCxlIgo7oo7TwDX-t1nSnkP0Rz9irJHDDpz5E9R9WWhUt080gBHWi5xxyIQHIlIGpVw9YehvSgFFyQY-8l3K5fARwXpdCxVQ4TGdbhfdok5sEFy2N7ZxbL998nwKIGLP-OnBqHAeBrnyyXvtg5nIiJXwTIziKtc3nK9gz9UxQ10Mc8Ya_DliOkFCfClvK6yulb-rxGdo5wQEq-e0r3uRWf8aWK72VutxdT5-HXHaXGkc-I9AM117HWhzrU16Am2hD1VrV2g369U\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHzMv3LXwsmKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

said there are expenditure cuts that were identified by a cabinet subcommittee which
amounts to R85 billion over the next three years.He
further mentioned that maintaining the top four tax brackets would raise an
additionalR36
billion in 2018/19,that would enable government to narrow the revenue gap. Over the next three years,
government will spend:• Spend an amount of R12.4 billion in 2018/19, R20.3 billion
in 2019/20 and R24.3 billion in 2020/21. This is in addition to a R10 billion
provisional allocation made in the 2017 Budget.• R4.2 billion will be spent for national health insurance
funded through adjustments to the medical tax credit, R490 million to establish
the Tirisano Construction Fund Trust and R1 billion for the 2021 Census.• An additional amount of R2.6 billion to enable an
above-inflation increase to social grants to partially offset the impact of tax
increases on the poor.• A provisional allocation of R6 billion set aside in
2018/19 for drought relief in several provinces, assistance to the water
sector, and public investment projects supported by improved infrastructure
planning. These allocations will be considered in the Adjustments Budget process.• Additions of R5 billion in 2018/19, R3 billion in 2019/20
and R2 billion in 2020/21 for fiscal risks and unforeseen developments,
bringing the total contingency reserve to R26 billion over the medium term.The main tax
proposals for 2018/19 are:• A one percentage point increase in VAT to 15 per cent.• No adjustments to the top four income tax brackets, and
below inflationadjustments to the bottom three brackets.• An increase of 52c/litre for fuel, consisting of a
22c/litre increase in thegeneral fuel levy and 30c/litre increase in the Road
Accident Fund levy.• Higher ad valorem excise duties for luxury goods.• Increased estate duty, to be levied at 25 per cent for
estates aboveR30 million.Gigaba said an appropriate balance is required as VAT is an
efficient, certain source of revenue provided that its design is kept simple. "Increasing the VAT rate by one percentage point is
estimated to have the least detrimental effects on economic growth and
employment over the medium term," Gigaba said.According to the minister, the zero-rating of basic food
items mitigates the effect of the increase on poor households, which with limited
adjustments to personal income tax brackets continue the progressive steepening
of the income tax curve.
