Following the incident, in March 2016, Ngcobo residents, the SA Council of Churches and ANC members marched for the Angel's Ministry Church to be closed down. The petition said while the church's rights were recognised, its teachings were morally wrong. Zamindawo Gqira, of the Council of Churches, said at the time that they did not recognise Angel's Ministry as a church.On Saturday morning, police were again removing children from the church hostels, this time due to it being an active crime scene, following a shootout with the gang allegedly behind the killing of several police officers on Wednesday. Seven of the gang members were killed and ten others arrested.At least 20 children have been removed from the church compound since the shootout.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/church-harbouring-ngcobo-massacre-suspects-no-stranger-to-controversy-20180224
