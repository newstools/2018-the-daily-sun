THE FACTS  A READER from Orlando, Soweto, said she claimed for maintenance for her son in 2011.When the case was finalised the money was deposited into the trust account of the lawyer.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>But the lawyer refuses to do anything for the child and has only paid R2000.She has tried to lodge a complaint with the Law Society, which couldn’t assist as a long time had passed before a complaint was lodged. They said attorneys or firms only retained accounting records and all files for five years. Her case has prescribed, but she doesn’t understand why because she was in contact with the lawyer from 2011 until last year. WHAT I DID  I then approached Scorpion Legal Protection for professional advice. SOLUTION  Scorpion advised that it cannot be said that the claim has prescribed as it was for future maintenance, which is why the money was placed in the trust account.And the society ought to assist her and investigate the attorney. She can escalate the complaint at the Law Society that’s attending to her complaint.You can strike back legally too!Click here
