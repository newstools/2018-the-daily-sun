We now use trains to get to work.” The fight is allegedly between two rival groups that are fighting over a route between Langa and Athlone. Andile Seyamo, a spokesman for the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association, said they were doing everything to in their power to stop the fight. Western Cape police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: “A man (51) linked to the two killings, as well as the nine attempted murders at Langa Taxi Rank, was arrested.”On Saturday, a taxi owner was shot dead near Thabo Mbeki squatter camp in Philippi East. Traut said a man (52) was arrested in connection with the incident.
