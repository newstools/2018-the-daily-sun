We have families and children.”Others celebrities who have also met their untimely demise on social media include award-winning hip hop artist Emtee, actress Terry Pheto and DJ Black Coffee, to name just a few.L’vovo said he’s working on an album which will be released at the end of next month.“The album is titled Ndlovu and is derived from my surname,” he told Daily Sun. He said fans can expect his first single, Take It Away, at the end of February.
