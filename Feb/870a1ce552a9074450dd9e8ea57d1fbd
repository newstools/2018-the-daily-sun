I know it’s a big match and there are big expectations,” said Shonga.“Given the chance I’ll deliver. Everyone follows this derby. I’ve followed it since my amateur days. We haven’t had much talk so far. We are just working very hard, preparing for it. It’s going to be a big weekend. “Of course I’ve spoken to Dennis Lota. I know what he has done in this fixture in the past. I regularly speak to Isaac Chansa, who encourages me.”Pirates moved past arch-rivals Chiefs in the Absa Premiership with the win against Chippa and now trail leaders Mamelodi Sundowns by four points. Bucs are second with 36 points from 22 matches.A derby success will not only edge them closer to the Brazilians, but will help open up a gap on their third-placed Soweto rivals.But Shonga has played down the possibility of Bucs clinching the league title.Like assistant coach Rhulani Mokwena, he insists that Pirates are still a work in progress and need another season before they can successfully challenge for league honours. In the meantime, however, Bucs have been quietly climbing up the standings.“The coach encourages me to score. If I don’t score I must assist my teammates so they can score,” Shonga said. “We are working on becoming a team capable of challenging for the league title.”Like this story?
