I had a great time and learnt many valuable lessons, yes, even when the pawpaw hit the fan. I wouldn’t change it for the world,” said Tumi.According to the statement, Tumi is planning on taking a short breather with her family before joining forces with her husband to co-write a movie.She also intends to take some of the time to focus on her TV presenting  and her stand up comedy work."This was not an easy decision for me at all. The timing was just not right for this relationship, it is like leaving a lover that you are still in love with. I really hope that fate will bring us together again one day"  she added.Meanwhile, Jacaranda FM General Manager Kevin Fine said they were glad to have gotten the chance to work with Tumi, whose “energy, wit, warmth and professionalism” left a lasting impression on everyone.Martin Bester will continue to host the Jacaranda FM breakfast show, together with Liesl Laurie and Elma Smit.
