In order to continue with his legacy we have to fight corruption.”The deputy president also spoke about the ongoing negotiations for Zuma to leave office.“As the ANC, we are currently engaged in discussions around the transition to a new administration and specifically to resolve the issues of the position of the president of South Africa,” he said.He said talks were under way in the interest of the people of SA and the ANC.“The successful resolution of this matter has great significant consequences for the country and the ANC. It is therefore important that we manage these discussions under way with care and purpose, ensuring that we put South Africa’s interests first,” he said.Earlier in the day, Ramaphosa attended a church service at the Anglican Cathedral in Cape Town’s CBD.He told churchgoers it was important for the leadership of the ANC to pray for wisdom from God.He said leaders needed wisdom to lead SA.Ramaphosa’s visit to Cape Town came as opposition parties, which were expecting Zuma’s resignation last week, planned to meet on Monday to map a way forward.A joint statement by the DA and EFF said they would invite all opposition parties to work together.Meanwhile, the ANC called for patience ahead of a hastily called national executive committee meeting today.Newly appointed spokesman Pule Mabe said it was hard to say whether the Zuma matter would be discussed, as the agenda would only be drawn at the meeting.Speaking at a rally in Mpumalanga on Saturday, party chairman Gwede Mantashe asked Ramaphosa to listen only to ANC structures. He accused the media and political analysts of throwing fuel on the fire by speculating about the president’s exit.The ANC’s top leaders had a meeting with Zuma on Saturday night, but by yesterday afternoon the outcome was still not known.On top of calling for a no confidence debate against Zuma, the EFF and other groups have threatened to march all over Mzansi if the ANC fails to remove Zuma.
