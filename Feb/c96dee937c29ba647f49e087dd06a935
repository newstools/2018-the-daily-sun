It hasn’t been easy for us in the past few matches but the aim is to collect as many points as possible to stay in Ligue 1,” said Zungu.“I’m fully fit and ready to return to the field whenever the coach calls on me. I’m here in France to play and I’ll give everything to get myself in a position to play.”Amiens beat Nantes 1-0 at the weekend to move just a point away from the relegation zone, above Toulouse, Angers and Troyes. They will have to chalk up another victory against Rennes when the teams clash on Saturday.) Elsewhere in France, Keagan Dolly will be looking to reclaim his spot in the Montpellier lineup after he sat out the goalless draw with Strasbourg on Friday. Dolly was an unused substitute but saw his team move up to fifth spot, equal on 39 points with Nantes, but they have some work to do to ensure Uefa Europa Cup qualification.) It wasn’t a good weekend for Lebogang Phiri and Lebo Mothiba, however, as their teams failed to register victories.Phiri earned another rare start as Guingamps played to a 2-2 draw at home with Metz to sit in 10th spot, equal on 35 points with Dijon FCO.Mothiba returned to the Lille lineup against Angers but could not help his side break a four-match winless run as they crashed to a 2-1 defeat to Angers.Things aren’t looking particularly good for Lille, who are now deep in the relegation mire with 27 points from 27 matches.) In the Dutch Eredivisie, former Bafana Bafana midfielder Thulani Serero watched from the bench as Vitesse were held to a 2-2 draw at VVV while Kamohelo Mokotjo was substituted midway through as Brentford suffered a narrow 1-0 defeat to Leeds United in the English Championship.) In Turkey, Lebohang Manyama missed his fifth consecutive match for Konyaspor as they lost 3-0 to Akhisarspor at the weekend. Manyama is not having the easiest of times in the Turkish Super Lig, having only played seven leagues matches so far this season.Like this story?
