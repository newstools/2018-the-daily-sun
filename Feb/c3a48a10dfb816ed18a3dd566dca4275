YOU can hardly tell if Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic is happy enough or maybe even angry.At best, there is a brief word or two and maybe a hint of a smile from the Orlando Pirates coach on the touchline.Micho guided his team to second place in the Absa Premiership table, their highest position this season, with a plucky 2-1 victory over Maritzburg United at home on Saturday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstftv78bAMlDYwNWPehvBMM1_6eA354qEFLkjPdnhx-Efcj6dpvFFI3utafgCWCrewVU81vAT8nEScQzWJBdwIEIXIEe8w14GX4YpYSxJygEPBV78frJW1PELjXqXkl4xYdi5q9eF9LK8CIu-bqst9VLWmoGtsTvnR3nGWtjASagdo7KVGJWtMrRJT0W9g8zp7jGB_IIUQE3sNgwcATQL_dOJ_Wj7D1odmV5nSb0lcUcBxet4owBQgs4XznOvvOOLQvQeAR82THAEgWwqWj9_1cQQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLM-5H3r0fluEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We have picked up 10 points in the previous block of 15 to 20 matches. From the next block of five we are looking to pick up as many points as possible. But it won’t be easy. We have Chippa United, Kaizer Chiefs, Golden Arrows and Bloemfontein Celtic.“We are focused on that process. We will stretch ourselves to the limit to prove we deserve to be this high – and even higher.“We believe that if things had gone the way we wanted, meaning if at least seven of those nine draws had been wins, it would be a totally different story. We would be runaway league leaders.”Bucs may not be running away with anything at the moment, but their performance reflected their ambition under Micho. They bounced back from a shock 3-0 loss to relegation candidates Ajax Cape Town to edge the Team of Choice through goals by Happy Jele and Thabiso Kutumela.“Can it be better? Yes it can be better,” Micho said.“In football you sometimes go two steps forward, one back, three forward. But it’s important to have progressive movement.”Key to the better showing has been Musa Nyatama, “a reflection of the new Pirates model”. Said Micho: “I believe Musa is a classic reflection and representative of the new model.”Like this story?
