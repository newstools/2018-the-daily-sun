Dyason said an inspection was carried out following a tip-off at nearby business properties.“At one of the business premises located in Dawn Street, Montague Gardens a container that was still on a trailer was found. It was established that the container and trailer was stolen earlier in the week from the property of one of the local scrap metal giants.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuGz99_GlNl-HdDXue9ETdBgq6nfdf3NhE5QcElI2r7JqN8lEzSLvofgenySPkwlsSwt3S1JNgSrjKjhx0wWgJbSQkraug3eXg4XFuujpl0wQ2isI8DcVLi9XCddLlzSbkqd6ZtHQS7CitwfjBo-ZxMD8d_sJg9P1LL-ctMyl64RpXb7QYnegH2BRl8hMmZ7ZiaNu7ZyuS1EzKVsMxFxNQZNc7s8AHRFZpU9UVA7TzoEgl9fvPfLg1tx208eVtPZ1HYmp72pcIGd1jst3YKNSnhuQ2ONgc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIrHWfArsjxQEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

No arrest has been made yet and the investigation continues,” he said.Meanwhile, new arrests were connected to the copper cable theft which resulted in the suspension of Metrorail’s Central Line in Cape Town due to vandalism of infrastructure last month.“Last Tuesday night security patrols chased four suspects busy digging for cables in the section between Bonteheuwel and Netreg.“The patrol team arrested three Bonteheuwel residents, the youngest of whom was only 15 years old. They were handed to Bishop Lavis police for processing,” said Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott.“Western Cape is operating at 60% capacity, having lost 101 carriages to arson and vandalism since October 2015.”Acting Prasa CEO Cromet Molepo told MPs that the Central Line will be fixed by Wednesday.
