POLICE are using new technology to combat gang violence. The cops are using a new system called Shotspotter in the gang-infested northern areas of Port Elizabeth. The technology uses strategically placed sound sensors to tell cops when shots have been fired and provide information about the location where the crime has occurred. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssl68ozuY75waIuW5RiSWvtd1RSSk1zA6gSrMRXgTW_jhcNYUsi7FnCSfh4qKlXfHBC7CxkKIbF9pUX_XT4zPRbgv5R4SzV-xl66bHqvuQF1dLhZf8tnqHoqHr1YlwPaNHZeGAgi9uQ6bo0UkpQCCv2PJMNjNIrG5zWgdNxONz5xtFdm9LCLpeIgrXLQqkvigUzwGlU6bgngYg41CWL3ZhMlwdsnlrVuEj1AFdclFL-mh2qFzMRUegwXMtnXcDfGuTcomwQn5XMLDSIHQyPp9yQB2Tgw-E\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNzDxRAcu2AMEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Some murders could not be reported as witnesses were being assassinated, while others chose to remain silent for fear of their lives. Since cops started using Shotspotter, 17 gang-related arrests have been made in Helenvale. Safety and security MMC John Best said before the launch of Shotspotter in October, a two-week trial showed 99% of shots fired in Helenvale were not reported to the police. “With this technology aiding the police, the gang unit and the Metro Police, we could have zero incidents in problematic areas,” he said. “We had about 15 streets where regular gunshot incidents occurred. “This has dropped to about three streets. “Three suspects were arrested for attempted murder, three for illegal possession of firearms and one for murder.“We also recovered one shotgun with 54 rounds and a 9mm pistol.”Shotspotter was created by a United States engineer and mathematician and has been in use for more than 20 years.
