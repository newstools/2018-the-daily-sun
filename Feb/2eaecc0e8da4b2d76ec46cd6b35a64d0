It is suspected the line goes from the nearby Tshilidzini Hospital to a plant in Muledane. Salome (30) said they’ve reported the line to local structures and Vhembei, which is the area’s water authority. “We are suffering here and life is very difficult. We don’t even know where to go to seek help anymore as the municipality is not doing anything.“Their offices are not far from here. We sometimes see their trucks driving past and we always hope they are coming here to solve our problem.” Sam Mudau from Maungani Village is also unhappy. “I work nearby but am forced to walk a long distance because the road to work has become a river full of faeces and nappies,” he said.“The sooner the municipality fixes this, the better for everyone.”Vhembe municipal spokesman Matodzi Ralushai said he was not aware of the burst pipe. He promised that the municipality would attend to it urgently.
