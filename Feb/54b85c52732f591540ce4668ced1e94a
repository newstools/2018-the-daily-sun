As a senior player in the team I feel the pressure of qualifying. We’ll have to do it for the country.“And also my football career only has a few years remaining, so the chance is now. "We have what it takes to make it to the big stage. The likes of Thembi Kgatlana and Linda Mothlalo are capable of making the country proud and team effort will be key,” she said.Banyana are yet to make their World Cup debut. Back in 2015 they missed out on a third place spot at the continental finals, a feat that would have guaranteed them a place in the Canada edition, when they lost 1-0 to the Ivory Coast.On Friday, Desiree Ellis charges flew to Cyprus where they will compete in the 2018 Cyprus Women’s Cup against Hungary, Slovakia, and Trinidad and Tobago. The tournament kicks off on Tuesday and Banyana will face Slovakia in their opening match on Wednesday.Matlou said: “We know what’s expected of us in Cyrpus. And looking at the group we’re in, we stand a good chance. Our target is to finish in the top four.”
