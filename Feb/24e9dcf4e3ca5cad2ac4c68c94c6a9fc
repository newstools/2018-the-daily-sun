It has been confirmed they were the same vehicles taken in the robbery. “The third vehicle was later found with its window broken and the battery and key missing. It was towed in for further investigation.” She said the fourth car, a white VW Polo, was still missing. “Police at first thought five vehicles were stolen during the robbery but it was later established only four were missing. The fifth car was found abandoned with an empty petrol tank on the premises. Police are following up on leads and are expected to make arrests soon.” There were rumours the robbery was committed to honour well-known car thief Thando Mlilwana, who was gunned down outside a tavern in Uitenhage last week. Eastern Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga said: “We commend the community for their efforts in working with the police and encourage them to continue doing so.”
