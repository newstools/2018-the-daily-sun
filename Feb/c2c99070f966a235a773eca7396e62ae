WHEN it is not poor officiating in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) making the football fraternity groan, it’s clubs parking the bus.This seems to be the latest trends of the 2017-18 PSL season.Just this past Friday, Roger de Sa, Platinum Stars’ owner-coach, was up in arms following some decisions by controversial referee Victor Gomes in their 2-1 loss to Maritzburg United.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu3MUhIdr4FOB2UvP-JtDnnvCdY7qzIYbzaRxDjVtdrqqJu5qOLEIPcIMiDMqM1SuDkBbW6XKHNAPQW6hUF2xnNxlT3CuvH5x_9V5-cFexARLDc2urGnAkA-Ui7ok5j0iVHNUvvaIm624X8aVHErbTMIK81jM3A3Gow_v-iSusZFH_YL4uLHuCv5OBvHFhovJKEO6JmygaSRD_fjiH4yVR2_3GWtbWkROhwZu6RE06YSevM4YkHOENAEZx7ynZBCLt7DgLN3GvjqRnWUqdbwar74w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNlxy8KBMk3DEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They (Sundowns) can complain about the bus at the back, but they were not prepared for the Ferrari (Evans Rusike) up-front.”Rusike is likened to the speedily accelerating Italian sports car because the 27-year-old Zimbabwean striker collected balls up-front in counter-attacks and attacked rapidly to trouble Downs goalie Denis Onyango.But Mosimane was not impressed and hit back at Tinkler: “What Ferrari is he talking about? He (Tinkler) has to come out of relegation then he can talk about Ferrari. He couldn’t even beat AmaZulu and now he is talking about Ferrari. “He parked the bus. He is lucky we did not get a penalty because I think Percy was fouled. I am waiting for him to come for advice in African competitions.”What irked Mosimane was the statement that the PSL pacesetters were not prepared for City’s “Ferrari”.And truth be told, Rusike was just unlucky not to have scored. Argued Mosimane further: “I can do the same and park the bus. I had Wayne Arendse on the bench but we play for a win.” The 53-year-old Mosimane said he was not worried about this draw as they gave their best.“Credit must got to my boys. It was a brilliant game,” he said. “I have yet to see a team that can play like this. We are still leading and maybe this Tshwane derby point is good for us. The Soweto derby is coming up this weekend. “I am not worried, we are still leading. Maybe our lead is not that huge and convincing, but we are not worried.”Tinkler, meanwhile, also heaped praise on his charges for a “fantastic performance”.Said Tinkler: “If we scored a second goal the game could have been buried. We were spot on with our tactics, especially in the attack when it comes breaks in the transition. We absorbed the pressure very well. I will take a point from this clash.”The Bafana Bafana legend said his team was regaining form after he gave some of his senior players a break in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 round.“The energy is back,” he added. “The players have a positive mind and different spirit. We aim to build on this performance, as it brings back some confidence for the players.”But he made it clear that finishing the season outside the top eight would not be acceptable.The three-time PSL champions are 11th in the table with 26 points and have eight games left to conclude the season.Like this story?
