After the  Film and Publication's Appeal Board ruled that the Film Inxeba (The Wound) be given the same classification as porn, stopping it from being screened in Cinemas or adult premises, one of its actors, Nakhane Toure, expressed his disappointment and disapproval at the verdict.Toure released an emotional statement on social media in which he revealed how he was treated as a gay man."We are vile. We are perverse. A virus that they will do anything to get rid of. I sat in my apartment reading the verdict, close to tears, shaking. I saw myself as a child, mocked for being effeminate. Afraid for my life as a teenager as I walked past straight men as I had no idea what they were capable of. I always had something to hide. They hated me" he  wroteif(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssQyrO1EWuxmLe71aq3eSQ2Yd9PVfMn311D9W3z5ebdeNwEfCEPLtuSP9fX3G8kK0pmMQJBt_cv3lRPAheU8U5vbe-e-r1aK-pr2GXbZ_EuX8_WTB10R6jRU6cZsiEUZxM6Cpms99mJqhPcheE-1KBnflgP87kjWpS3EBw-6ONT8M8srEFV66pKz4_Lu_UT-yZonwMR9pYv7G8gq37vEteyAhCc2WqeCVywxFD5k2xBwRK8HpCvC1CO_SPMwH6jrBuChsCjq7TjqJTwsXh4fUFvpKCZxExv1BYVaQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFBfJwGrcNzeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I'm an umXhosa and I don't know what to do with what I love, but doesn't love me."I said I’d sit until tomorrow to share my feelings about the Inxeba X18 rating, but Fuck that.
