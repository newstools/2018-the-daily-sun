The resident said: “I was on my way to work when I saw the body. “She had a R20 note in her hand. Perhaps she was attacked on the road and dragged into the bush, where she was probably raped before being stabbed to death.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said cases of murder, rape and robbery are being investigated. She said the woman had 19 stab wounds. “A post mortem will be done to see if she was raped. Two suspects aged 20 and 25 were arrested. The woman is still unknown.” Women in the area are in shock as Saturday’s incident happened just days after another woman was stabbed to death during a robbery last Monday.Nelisiwe Nkosi (41) from Blaauwbosch Village had returned home from work when she was allegedly confronted by unknown thugs in her house. The mum of two was robbed of her daily earnings. Her seven-year-old daughter found her mother’s lifeless body when she came home from school. Nelisiwe’s cousin Thuli Nkosi (47) said: “She was stabbed to death and her cellphone and cash stolen.”Constable Nonjabulo Langa said: “A case of murder and robbery was opened but no arrests have been made. “Investigations are underway.”
