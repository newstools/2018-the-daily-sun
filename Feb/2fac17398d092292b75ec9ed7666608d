Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa has reportedly challenged private manufactures in the country to produce condoms so as "to address concerns over the size of condoms imported from China".According to NewsDay, Parirenyatwa said the move would also save on foreign currency.Parirenyatwa said this while speaking during the launch of the Zimbabwe Private Sector HIV and Aids and Wellness (ZIPSHAW) co-ordinating board in the capital Harare. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstDXRbpX_7ZoISJGp2KlY3Xuk9_hctVVed5MTrMGRwGpipVMMqksr-IKRwKpuUPJx00QyvWiwHrKHZavfLEkgkEvlaP8WTwafxW3Z4sMYuxE1n7hV1yJUdH06PGBjK8nMY4a9TtIR8d6EwUg36WnWvLqdFpoOkRTVaYLigHOPUIJ-0Hq25SzUjkztxsGUOQyMvcDKWCxEmvCI5K9Rtesgam0s_KwVTk7ouAA2-fnD6MoJBlEIq8Hx0obnmhZ5UgqyjrAvIGAWsMmbqriqxdXB1UxrSPRjgRrp7lPA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzD0qwfKBGTjqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
