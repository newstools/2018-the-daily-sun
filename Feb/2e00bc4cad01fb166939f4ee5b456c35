Former Generations actress Sophie Ndaba, best known for her role as the bubbly Queen Moroka, has learned a lot off camera since being fired from the show and it’s thanks to her ‘perfect’ mentor Mfundi Vundla.While it is no secret that they have not always seen eye to eye, Sophie revealed in an Interview on Trending SA that she still sees Mfundi  as a father figure and has learnt a lot from him.“I’ve always seen Mfundi as a father figure, and I believe in honesty. When I felt he was wrong, I told him he was wrong, and I felt that it was time, not to necessarily make peace but to say, let’s get on with it.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstKiWO61NH_DM4PAnOeQM_q1gZt1Ii44Kbv8PtHd2OVXiagNUf3uppFp-EBKzKK7KjuXYKFj_BlkBLG0b3-NZ3cVdYhkSG3YtMsoNACpUYRSQyES8u-tAY96_FM10MnzN_67hIFYFNLycrciiN_IaYgw9Sm-njI3gt7_eX7pJyLVZTtRJV430gesLa6GSzwTcmvupFtfEth698_tp-Cu0O_mDK7U-HN3aDaMwDVrAuOmfkBkFe2qb3n1vfxSIFj5AxxGAAvFNy55TaAT2aH46_QklkWvGLJp7TNTw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMd9TgdDG0-QEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I do property now, I do decor, I do project management and those projects, I do events, I do international events, I do concerts."
