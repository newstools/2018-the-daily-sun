We did a number of road shows with production houses to encourage work submission.“But still some production houses chose not to submit. Awards don’t just happen in a vacuum.”A total of 348 entries were received for 79 categories. “They include drama, comedy, soaps/telenovelas, feature films, documentary features and TV non-fictional productions.”The real battle lies in the comedy categories where shows like Hotel, Ses’Top La, Elke Skewe Pot and Puppet Nation are almost head to head.The awards ceremony will be held at Sun City, North West on 24 March.
