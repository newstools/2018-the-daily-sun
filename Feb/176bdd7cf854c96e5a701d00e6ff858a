will be challenging a High Court ruling from December that found that his
appointment was not valid, and should be set aside.The
ruling also gave then-deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa 60 days to find a
replacement for Abrahams.Former
President Zuma lent his support in appealing the High Court ruling.However,
since Ramaphosa has taken office, he has withdrawn the appeal.Abrahams
has been in hot water since he was accused of trying to protect Zuma from
prosecution.He
further claimed that Ramaphosa’s appointment as the country’s number one
removes any justification for his removal.Abrahams
will also challenge the High Court finding that he took Zuma’s side in his
response to the Spy Tapes and Mxolisi Nxasana sagas.Abrahams
confirmed on Monday that he has made a decision whether he will reinstate
corruption charges against former President Zuma.However,
he said that he will announce the outcome on 15 March.During
the State of the Nation Address, Ramaphosa said that he would “fix leadership
issues at institutions like the NPA and SARS urgently.”
