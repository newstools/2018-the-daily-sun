Hunt applauded his team for their great performance. Lehlohonolo Majoro’s second-half header cancelled out Ryan Moon’s first-half opener for Amakhosi. Wits host Cape Town City FC in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 round at the same venue on Wednesday. The Clever Boys are 13th in the league table with 22 points from 20 games and not yet safe from relegation. But Hunt is encouraged by what he has seen so far. They will temporarily put their league problems out of their minds to focus on City’s visit. The coach said they were in the right frame of mind for the encounter. “We let Chiefs off the hook. We had the three points in our hands,” Hunt said.“I don’t shout at the players any more, we just need to be positive. Chiefs never came into our half in the first half, it was just one counter-attack and they got their goal. I can’t fault the players, they were brilliant. They played their part, we just couldn’t get that winning goal.” Daylon Claasen was singled out for special praise for his showing against Amakhosi. Majoro and Edwin Gyimah also got some praise from Hunt, who was in a good mood. Majoro scored his first goal in five matches for Wits since arriving from City in the January transfer window. Hunt said: “Gyimah is underrated. He is a valuable player to us. Claasen bagged four Man of the Match awards in the past five games – he’s been great for us.“Majoro works hard for the team and I’m happy he scored.”Looking ahead at the City game, Hunt said Wits were ready for them: “We are in a good mental space and players want to play. We are ready. Chiefs had to hang on for dear life. With that type of performance we are ready for anything. If we play like that, we should win.” Like this story?
