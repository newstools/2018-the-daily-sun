They wore traditional Sotho, Xhosa and Zulu attire. For some the film was an opportunity to watch a celebrated African superhero, and for others it was all about celebrating the success of a mostly black cast.The film is about T’Challa, the prince of Wakanda, a fictional technologically advanced kingdom in Africa.After T’Challa’s father, portrayed by legendary actor John Kani, dies, a powerful enemy appears and threatens T’Challa’s throne and the kingdom.SunLanders took to social media to talk about what touched them the most about the movie.Blogger Khaya Dlanga, watched it on Friday, said it exceeded his expectations.“It’s a fun movie that goes between funny to poignant and painfully honest,” he said.“It touched me in a profoundly personal manner.”He said there was spontaneous applause, laughter and people nodding in agreement. “It made black people feel truly comfortable to behave in the blackest way possible. It warmed my heart.” Fabrice Beya said: “It contrasts two very interesting world views regarding our situation as Africans today.”Namhla Mniki-Mangaliso said people screamed at the end of the film. “I went to Wakanda,” she told SunBuzz. “I saw visions of times past, times present, and times to come. “Things as they were, as they are and could be.”“Maybe after I’ve gone back a second and third time, I’ll find a voice to explain why it’s such an important story.”
