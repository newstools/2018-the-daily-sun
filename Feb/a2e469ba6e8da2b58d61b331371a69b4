Veteran SABC broadcast journalist Peter Ndoro will be taking a break from his job after he mistakenly declared on national TV that President Cyril Ramaphosa had died instead of Zimbabwe's MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai.His error follows another blunder in January, when he announced that IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had died instead of Bantustan of Bophuthatswana leader Lucas Manyane Mangope.In a statement, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said, while the public broadcaster acknowledged that it was human nature, "we take the matter in a very serious light, as it is not only embarrassing, but could potentially affect those involved negatively".if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuKRu95nHBy_FisWfhf_DEB8KuvTnLBGT5RMxASHrgaO3Y5X2s2ArBGmHdLBq-jc6QCblTsE_s2xtzRwlzOttXVShInnS4DqXLLU0z29bxIJUvSO_ZECjampPQvETnuj8WAy2UUTbVrwPzmnet6lcQj9l_q3uj5qG25JKR3uhVoaVGhWVas1mL6Vf57RMKQKrYegVuGbhX3NmTlR8E4ZxkwvRz9Naz1TOOKKqiRoEmq_dIx2H3Z6c_bohbOaVHM-W_fOO83RN8G6v4mN8L8euhtYwz4acQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBIByeKfY3J0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
