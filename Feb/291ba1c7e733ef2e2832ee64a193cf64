Her body was discovered early in the morning of 31 March 2017.The victim and the suspect had been in a long term relationship at the time of her murder, but it is not  clear as to what exactly  happened between them prior to her murder.In a similar incident, a woman Thembisile Yende was allegedly killed and left to in the office for 10 days at one of the Eskom offices in Spring in March last year.Ivory Park police station commander , Brigadier David Ngcobo, has thanked the detectives involved for the patience in gathering the evidence that led to this arrest, which would, hopefully, lead to a conviction.“It may have taken a while to connect the dots but what matters is that someone has eventually been found and is now supposed to account to the law and, by extension, to the family of the deceased,” said Brigadier Ngcobo.Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said he was not aware of the man’s arrest and incident. “Anyone found on the wrong side of the law should face the full might of the law despite where they work or what position they hold in their offices,” said Phasiwe.The suspect will be charged with murder and is expected to appear in the Tembisa Magistrate’s Court on Monday.
