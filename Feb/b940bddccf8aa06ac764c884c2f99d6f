When I went outside I saw three men in front of the substation. When they saw me they ran away, leaving their bolt cutter.“I saw that the padlock was broken and a big cable was gone.”He said he contacted the municipality for help. Nelson Mandela Bay spokesperson Mthubanzi Mniki said: “The municipality condemns the stealing of cables. This costs residents a lot of money and poses a danger, especially to children,” said Mniki. He said people can call (041) 392 4323 to report any illegal connections and theft of cables.
