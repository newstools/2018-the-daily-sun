He can kill for profit. Ask the people of Marikana."We all know that Ramaphosa has blood on his hands. The same way he is prosecuting Zuma, we will prosecute him. He is using his influence to avoid prosecution with his group," he said.Malema said he has never seen captains of Industry so happy, in that they have began to manipulate the Rand to show strength. "There is no strength here. When white capital praises something, you must know that there is something wrong."Malema was very happy at the way Zuma is treating the ANC. "When we warned them about this man, were told that we are rascals and anarchists - were even had bouncers beating us in parliament. Today the man is saying he is not going anywhere," said Malema.He said SONA must come but it must be delivered by people who respect the Constitution "not that Constitutional delinquent."He promised that on Thursday there will be a Motion of No Confidence debate against Zuma before the SONA. "Why spend R4-million on a SONA that will not be listened to by anyone."Who will listen to Zuma..what will he tell you?" asked Malema.He said once the EFF finishes speaking in parliament on Thursday people will switch TV channels.He added they are also seeking a legal action to interdict Zuma from speaking in Parliament."Why should he address the nation when his party is not even interested in him?"On the Life Esidimeni tragedy, Malema said David Makhura and Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi must take full responsibility.Turning to Motsoaledi, Malema said they are not going to buy into his (Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi) crocodile tears."Journalists have fallen for Dr Motsoaledi because he answers his phone personally and always agrees to do interviews."They say he is hard working but there is nothing to show he is hard working.... Motswaledi is busy over nothing. "We want a functional healthcare system," said Malema.He was not moved by the water crisis in Cape Town."We see trucks taking water to Cape Town but we don't see trucks taking water to Giyani."That's why the EFF are not excited about the Cape Town water crisis."
