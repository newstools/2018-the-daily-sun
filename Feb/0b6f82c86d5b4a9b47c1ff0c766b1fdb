“IF they plan to judge us based on past performances, they are in for a nasty surprise.”That is the strong warning from Ubuntu Cape Town FC striker Ranga Chivaviro ahead of their Nedbank Cup Last 32 clash with top flight team Polokwane City at Athlone Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm). This will be Ubuntu’s first appearance in the Nedbank Cup and they want to make their presence felt in this competition, which has served up several surprises over the years.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvC84ixQ0JyFT8Ew_S_py6fR75c1DXdZ4hKA5F1iYlo94-_G5PMZrpbZ6UB5cQAY_Sqjiyd4JjztM74qJNH3kecJPexmk18p--Z6r_e5Ur5gPOE0LJWK354xFNNo-t4dr6RCmuhHUGCp5PIdkU1PbjevRzWBfsIHF86chWAViLB6_RNKzbx6VhOvon6zWkc7bf49HOJzpfIPVbWBeF374ij8zVc4V3dFoUYsiEQsdcV1pfqWhxQIYTPhUrbQawQBKwzHmzdur7bzbkMbf_j6w4aDU-g7yG9Npk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEOkb1Oxg4ziEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Ubuntu are currently bottom of the standings with 17 points from 20 matches.Chivaviro, who is among the top goal-scorers in the league with nine goals, says it will be a different ball game on the night.“There’s a difference between cup and league games, and this is the only cup competition that NFD teams get to participate in, so we must make it count. We aim to make a name for ourselves, like other NFD teams have done before us,” said Chivaviro. The 25-year-old Limpopo-born striker has been one of the impressive players in Ubuntu’s setup this season. If he continues banging in the goals he could find himself playing in the Absa Premiership next season. Chivaviro started his football career at a young age, like most other players, but he only started seeing light at the end of the tunnel in 2013 when he was selected to represent Mpumalanga at the SAB League Under-21 National Championships. He promptly made an impact, scoring six goals. Chivaviro was playing for Sasol Juventus at the time. After the SAB Under-21 tournament he was signed by Witbank Spurs on a two-and-a-half year deal. In the 2015-16 season he joined Cape All Stars on a six-month deal before joining Ubuntu last season, when they were still known as FC Cape Town. He said: “I have come a long way and playing against a Premiership team is motivation for me and also an opportunity to market myself.“Making it to the next round will come with a lot of benefits and will boost our confidence when we go back to the league. “We are going there as underdogs and we have nothing to lose. We know their strengths and weaknesses, we are looking forward to the match.”Like this story?
