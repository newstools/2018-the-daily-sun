But she was shocked when she received a call from the police on Thursday, informing her that her case had been thrown out of court.“They took the statement when I was in hospital but later when I wanted to sign it, they took me from pillar to post. I was then told that I couldn’t open a case because the officer who shot the dog has already opened one,” she said. Nomvula said cops promised to get back to her about the outcomes of the case and the court date but never did. Inspector Meshack Matlou from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, advised Nomvula to go back to the police station and ask for the station commander.“She has to open a case against the dog owner and the police should allow her to do that,” he said. Rietgat police spokesman Captain Stephen Maluleka said:, according to the investigating officer, they explained everything to Nomvula and told her that a case was opened on her behalf. “I’ll talk to her to get her side of the story, and we’ll take it from there.”The dog’s owner Jimmy Mogopa said he tried to reach out to Nomvula after the incident but she was still in a critical state.: “I bumped into her on the street and told her we’d talk once she had fully recovered.”
