A source said: “Cops have heard that sometimes when Langelihle was away, other men would pick Nozipho up at work.“Cops have tried everything to establish the truth. The person responsible for their disappearance has to be found and questioned.”Daily Sun first reported on the mystery disappearance early last month after police and the couple’s families pleaded for anyone with information to come forward. On the day of their disappearance, Nozipho knocked off early from work at a local bakery.Her sister, Lindiwe Zondi (32), said she had asked Langelihle to meet her because she was scared of going through Umhlatuzana forest at night. However, the two never arrived home. When their families tried to phone them, their cellphones went straight to voicemail. Lindiwe said she was unaware of her sister’s alleged cheating. “I only know she was happy with Langelihle. She never told me she had other boyfriends.”Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the matter was still being investigated. “Statements will be taken from people close to the couple,” he said.
