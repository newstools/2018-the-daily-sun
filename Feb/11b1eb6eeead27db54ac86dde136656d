The Spanish competition will provide consultancy services to the BPL in areas of sport, innovation, marketing, commerce and finance. The development of women's football is another of the areas in which LaLiga will offer the benefits of its extensive experience to support the BPL.The Spaniards will help to train local coaches in Botswana via the methods which has earned it such great success and will also provide guidance to Botswana's league on issues relating to promoting its competition and attendance at stadiums.This is a similar international agreement LaLiga has signed with other major African leagues, such as the Kenyan Premier League, as well as on other continents, including Colombia's Dimayor and Japan's J. League.This is their effort to grow the brand around the globle, focusing also on the African continent where the league has continued to attract interest.
