Describing Dlamini-Zuma as a “loyal member” of the ANC on a branch level and as a NEC and NWC member, “no mischievous attempts of wedge driving will persuade her out of the movement she has dedicated all her life to.”On Sunday, an article published on the Times Live website alleges that Dlamini-Zuma told President Cyril Ramaphosa that she wanted to leave Parliament as she was tired.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/full-of-energy-dlamini-zuma-is-not-resigning-20180218
