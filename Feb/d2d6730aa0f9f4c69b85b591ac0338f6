PARENTS of pupils at the crumbling Makangwane High School claim the Limpopo Education Department has been sending them from pillar to post for years.More misery came last month when part of the roof was destroyed by a storm.This has left pupils with no other choice but to go to school outdoors.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The kids struggle to concentrate while donkeys walk by. They also have to keep an eye out for the snakes lurking in the bushes.The school in Nomparella Village, outside Bochum, is widely regarded as one of the better performing schools in the district.But now all four of the school’s blocks have cracked walls and what’s left of the roof looks as if it could be destroyed by a strong wind at any time.Jess Ngoepe, a member of the school’s governing body, told Daily Sun: “We went to Maleboho Education Circuit several times but got no answers. “In 2016 we protested outside their office and handed over our memorandum of grievances, but still nobody got back to us. Even mobile classrooms would be welcome.”He said the pupils have been learning outdoors for almost a month.Desmond Mojela (18), president of the school’s learner representative council, said: “We can’t even use chalkboards. This situation is affecting us badly. “We want a new building.”Limpopo Education spokesman Sam Makondo said schools damaged by storms were a big concern as the department had not budgeted for such events.“The school applied to be moved to a new site and that process is underway.” He added that the school was prioritised for the 2018/19 financial year and that mobile classrooms would be provided as a temporary solution.
