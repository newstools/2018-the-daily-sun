EXPERIENCE counts in everything!This statement will be put to the test on Saturday when Teko “General” Modise and Siphiwe “Shabba” Tshabalala lead by example as Cape Town City FC visit Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium (8.15pm).The duo are known to be creative when it comes to steering their teams in the right direction and setting up goals for their strikers.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvxLZiIZdZFFMfX7QthbX2cgqI_BpEnmO77JQhQwZaCLy-gLoQcf4vlvhXW7ttDkdfa-59IqVXHKgPcU5EY9seXAb8gzEpKWnkfrptdD-NzAyHsqJ5p4ppAR1w45rzrWXlEBFljOg16_ybUf0HR22ZqBU5wPPl6YcqAU70NojEF3Iwirq-Mq9PcuPNhur7l9dlUU8z6CW6xEwNmlXwu00-jVdAjD-z3i6dRRSgBgjHbOmFHhcT-5dHtmRriKEaK3e9aojyYETpDEwHv535-4ISALg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLWZF1lwNVLYEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
