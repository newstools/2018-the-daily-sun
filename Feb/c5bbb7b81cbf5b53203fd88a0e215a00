We are all treated by one doctor. “The nurses can’t even cope because they’re short-staffed. We demand more nurses.”Another patient, Ncediswa Dyosi (47), said: “There’s no privacy at the clinic and people are exposed to all kinds of diseases. “We demand more consultation rooms,” he said.Some residents said they risk losing their jobs because of the poor service at the clinic.Domestic worker Eunice Puwe (54) said: “I might get fired because I always ask for permission to fetch my treatment. But I often don’t get medication because of the poor service.”Another resident, Ben Sogaxa (45), said: “My boss told me not to come to work unless I bring a doctor’s note. But our clinic doctor is not readily available.”Eastern Cape Health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo told the People’s Paper: “We’re concerned about the protest.“It’s not the proper way to resolve matters.”
