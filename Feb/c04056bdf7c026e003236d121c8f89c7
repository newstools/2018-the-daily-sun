AS Maritzburg United prepare to visit AmaZulu for tonight’s only Absa Premiership fixture, veteran Usuthu striker Siyabonga “Bhele” Nomvethe says he sees similarities between all the KZN teams.He is not worried about the points difference between them and United. United are sixth in the league table with 28 points while Cavin Johnson’s charges are eighth, just two points behind. Their other provincial rivals, Golden Arrows, are 12th with 23 points – three points short of AmaZulu and five behind the Team of Choice.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss_sEQ8UaFBfI6MlTxm0BR69vyMOz_cxTQBsd-Np2CMEWLDwuShUVSXB0D8ZlZFEdfPXthDwCDSM7K0ETgNZr7YcImJVUAiAFbXILXBCb7FaHMZ5iVTSN-mQHHT5yIjl-bni51-givqgg04-FSO3eb0ySAD_z27V9ovzquY_nQ4oN-6wQmSkHiHSsZ7wR1BXTkgsBW4KvPS5YODazFy-d3EI21UZB_OVhwQMRPw1hhB1t7fwQV22njYbhxwXBvEPrA0HWcXhvKbY-Yp987oeOJYDw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJj88OkdL89NEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We expect a similar match to the one we just had against Arrows. It will still be tough but we will have to be brave. In my experience, derbies are not really different to other matches.” The 40-year-old is expected to play a crucial role in Usuthu’s endeavour to record back-to-back victories over provincial rivals.His experience helped AmaZulu beat Arrows 2-1 in the Premiership a fortnight ago. Even though he did not score, his trademark runs proved to be too much for Arrows’ back four at times. He had them working overtime. Nomvethe, who played in the Soweto derby between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates earlier in his career, added that the tempo of tonight’s clash would be on another level. “This match is like a final. We must keep playing our normal game. Maritzburg are not an easy team.”Usuthu will be without suspended midfielder Michael Morton.
