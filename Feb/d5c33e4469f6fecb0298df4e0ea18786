When his grant money ran out, he hired nyaope smokers to help him, and paid them with pots, cutlery and any other metal objects around the house.As a result of paying helpers, Jacob could not afford to pay the rates and his electricity was cut off. Now he is in the middle of a battle over the house with relatives. He was on the brink of giving up when he met Good Samaritan, Dimakatso Mashakoe (34). Dimakatso arrives every day to clean the madala’s house and do his washing. In the evening, she cooks for him and puts him to bed. She said: “His electricity needs to be sorted out and he also needs someone who will help take care of him in the day. It’s hard for him when I’m away.”
