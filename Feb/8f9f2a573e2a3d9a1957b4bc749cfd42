Jordaan said: “We want to see Banyana in the top two in Africa and in order to achieve that we have to reach the final of the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Ghana.”“The path is clear, finish in the top three at Afcon, qualify for the World Cup and Olympics.” Ellis admitted she feels immense pressure to deliver what the nation wants: “I have been given the task and it’s not negotiable – we have to do it for women’s football. “You already get pressure when you are in charge of the national team, and the Under-17s’ qualification for the World Cup has raised the pressure level a bit. “But we have confident group of players and share the same goal: Qualifying for Afcon and the World Cup.”Banyana will leave the country for Cyprus today, where they will compete in the 2018 Cyprus Women’s Cup against Hungary, Slovakia, and Trinidad and Tobago. The tournament runs from 28 February until 8 March. Banyana face Slovakia in their opening match on Wednesday. Like this story?
