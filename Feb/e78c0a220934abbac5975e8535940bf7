It is not safe for him to walk to the bus stop alone. “The bus drops him at the same stop again after school and I have to wait there every day because I can’t let my son walk home alone.”Ntombi believes she is being punished for being too vocal. “When I asked the school, they said they were saving petrol.”When Daily Sun called Karitas School for the Disabled, the principal said he was aware of the situation but could not comment on the matter.Western Cape Education Department spokeswoman Jessica Shelver said a complaint was laid by the pupil’s parent. She said the school principal reported that it was not possible for the bus to pick up pupils from their front doors.“The alleged pupil currently walks 114 metres from home to the pick-up point. The school reportedly spoke to the pupil’s mother about the matter and that her child walks a short distance,” said Shelver.
