Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga took to the streets on Thursday with law enforcement in what he has called the “declaration of war” on crime and drugs. Forming part of Operation Tswelopele, Msimanga along with the Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD), home affairs officials and members of the mayoral committee raided several suspected drug dens and brothels in Pretoria West. Armed with search warrants, TMPD officers broke down doors to flats and houses. In one of the suspected drug dens, a man was found with Methcathinone, known as Cat. “They planted them on me, I don’t even do drugs, I don’t sell drugs. I don’t even know what are those things,” the suspect told media. He made the same claims when Msimanga spoke to him, asking the suspect where he came from and who he was supplying.Msimanga also asked that his car be searched as the suspect alleged his identification papers were there.Msimanga also walked into a suspected brothel where a couple were “caught in the act” as he described it.The male was found with a white powder, which the narcotics team in the TMPD have taken for testing.“We have closed a number of illegally operated shops. Other people were arrested for drug possession and dealing,” said Msimanga.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssBQXl7qT1xq7eVxgVqWJRlcPw_bIczAN6gqcGWGnLr8l6UHHAomYpSyHOz3OAceO8soDEFZB00MvvAwzlik0xqduMTR3sI56uyx4VnJslgZLY7TyiqE6cTTUnTaI0nK83JFQz7AMeQdvZytkasS68I2ei4twfRTeHPreikecuEEBQSQHVLLDk2Obt36iK6udcSy_bSayr6KGQE1bS-w8JYnqAQ4Kwbn0dMTxk4h3vFTpglEHN_D3eGl1p5LG7MHbQMCq1Vfk5egue9I-gH72QferSTXNE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAUijY97wxZwEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
