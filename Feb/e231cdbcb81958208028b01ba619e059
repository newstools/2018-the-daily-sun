the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) in respect to a complaint
submitted by Thinus Ferreira regarding the news item that was broadcast on 02
November 2017 at 18H00.Ferreira
felt that the SABC’s News Division failed to produce and deliver a balanced,
fair and accurate report of the ‘Black Monday’ protest. In
his complaint, he condemned the use of strong language, visuals of the old
South African, AWB and German Swastika flags and questioned why the flags were
shown.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvxnk_meQMdlixBNgwWTT_esXa7Hyo2_uPAg4E10ahxM2iraozBs2oiOxy-p36uF5a1Qlk5HrrCvlBvze4z-bNfCtFIXQ6N4wRYi5YxAFFYfG3w04AGL8z6veKVxWP5X-c4ZpNUTOZuXDlWthXRXlAiQXPlafI3mr3c-qHnO2D7H5HoWTE1sF5UIHJqGiZhe5J8Z34SX0hspl6anHG4JQgDRfQzBsaQQXUzQAaamhNla2646cQTpTlEh_72BU7O-3DvyE2T8sd9DxpCK3m3w8UlIDTitYk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKGyFrWHGUhFEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

to SABC spokesman Kazier Kganyago, he said Ferreira further stated that the
SABC spread wrong information and made an issue of national importance worse.“The
SABC disputed these claims, maintaining that the march was fairly covered and
the focus of the story was about the actions of the protesters. The
story was angled to look at other aspects that had not been covered. Nowhere in
the clip did the reporter or the Minister say the burning of the flag happened
on that day,” he said in a statement.Kganyago
said the SABC would like to reassure its audiences
of its unwavering commitment to deliver news that is well-researched, accurate
and unbiased, without compromising its public mandate, integrity and editorial
independence.
