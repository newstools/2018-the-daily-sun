I was reluctant to go out as I knew it was an accident. “I didn’t want to see it because of the trauma I’ve been through with my kids. Eventually I decided to go out and was shocked at what I saw.”She said as she came out and was met by people screaming out her daughter’s name. “Then I saw her motionless body covered in blood. I ran and knelt besides her as I thought that she was still alive. “I ran back to the house to fetch water and a cloth to clean her face. But when I came back her body was covered with a blanket and I was told she was dead,” said a devastated Josephine. She told Daily Sun that Nonkululeko’s tragic death was the third in her family. “I just wanted to die and ran towards the road and waited for the next car to pass so I could just throw myself at it. “It is painful and confusing. Why do my children have to die so tragically?” said the sad Josephine.She said her first child to die in an accident was her son when the bus they were travelling in crashed. That was in 1980. Years later another of her children, also a son, died when his car collided with another in 2008. And now her daughter. “I can only pray to God that he spares the lives of my four remaining children. One of them has been involved in four serious accidents but survived. “I don’t know what it means but I just want it to stop,” she said.
