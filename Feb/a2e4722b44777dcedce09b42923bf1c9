IT WILL take a bit longer for Tendai Ndoro’s case to be finalised by Safa’s arbitrator.According to Safa’s head of legal matters, Tebogo Motlanthe, there are outstanding documents needed from all parties involved before a ruling can be made.This comes after the Premier Soccer League appealed the decision by the Dispute Resolution Chamber last week to give Ndoro the go-ahead to play. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuhzr94ah2taiW_fCY36-Ekv0eqCSmY5YLKnVlII7J3TSF-XmgqPGCumABOltbegZkR190zuNjDGjREKmb7YktCUOx9pESy86LAkbVikgPL2j11nsUbDP0YmMM8XsG2KwSwvf4509quBYDW19tch78HA0qeyKbUpGJSiJotPvWti_YvofxB0ft8y19i6EucRPI4CAcQaoMKnX0Cb3VR9W_Uy3nKJnVnz40H2TRULs-G3Fj2QW8M0GJpKdNH5laLk6NAf0B5_gHj-p59eYkGM7QrPw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzI-oT4CHGdFcEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Ndoro played for Orlando Pirates in August, then moved to Al Faisaly in Saudi Arabia before joining Ajax Cape Town in the January transfer window.If found guilty, Ajax could be docked eight points, as Ndoro has featured in four matches since his arrival in Cape Town. This include a 3-1 win over Platinum Stars and a 3-0 win against Bucs, who were playing under protest. This was followed by a goalless draw with Polokwane City.Said Motlanthe: “We are still waiting for documents from both parties before we can proceed.”Pirates official Floyd Mbele said they would be guided by the PSL on the matter. Bucs face Ajax in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (8.15pm).Explained Mbele: “We sent our protest to the league and they must tell us what’s happening. I haven’t heard anything yet.”Ajax spokesman Thabiso “Shooz” Mekuto said their coach, Muhsin Ertugral, would make the  decision whether to field Ndoro against Pirates or not. “Our technical staff will make the decision to play who they want to play on the day. As a club we don’t want to comment further.”
