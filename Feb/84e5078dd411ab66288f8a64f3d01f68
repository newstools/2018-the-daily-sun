SINGER Loyiso Bala opened a huge can of worms when he took to Twitter on Saturday morning to share his thoughts on Inxeba: The Wound.After he criticised the controversial film, opponents came out guns blazing, attacking his music career and family. The tweet that caused all the trouble read: “The release of Inxeba totally ridicules and disrespects the wishes and traditions of the Xhosa culture. If we, as a country, cannot protect our own cultural beliefs and differences, no one else will do it for us. As a Christian, I would not depict a picture of the Muslim prophet Mohammed. Not because I believe in the reasons behind it but because I respect the wishes of the Muslim community. Why, when it comes to our own traditions, can’t we give each other the same respect? #BanInxeba”. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuRO_UkaRzsF9nBXvrp8aesSHgonxRj9bSfwHtrrQu5py4RMM4nwlmdCV8araXIuJ1D4z7mb4sGdGlYYRQcsbFi44G9AjQc4IEdDXoo1Q_0Wo_CIE4x63-nbHzfLG6cc9qz1Tk4QHXz3cMuNg6SYSrqevXLjR5us1vMPxi6Kf42GNj82TySI_Ym94IH1Zlfz_yJ3QVwxdAVu_rlwj4VR4YLplsXdUWUZtp4FSrx30CGciEtyeVIPJuXKtbVXLagm4lTtTd6jTOFjYdvF9ZsDLwfbitkNAOzr9fjkQ\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YR4bnJmTe93IqWFgewE9MUXsiXJAynIz0aEbV9sYrr9VgYl-DTFUSrc0-oERYBtjcI8rIuwjm7QU3TRdKnr2wA5AR4zB0b6JJf1t6M\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA3LQfun4myiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Speaking to Daily Sun, he said he was offended because what happens on the mountain should not be discussed in public. “The film is too detailed. We need to protect our cultural values,” Loyiso said. Meanwhile, Elias Ribeiro, the producer of the movie, said he was not willing to discuss it with people who had not seen it. “I spent five years researching it and engaged with a lot of experts,” he said.
