FOR every country to function effectively, its citizens must have a sense of pride in it.In our case, we really need to start being proud of being African and South African in particular.Building a prosperous nation will not happen in spitefulness and hatred for one another or of the country itself. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvHgJ7qjHewlbRaL89rlr_3WFSmLp79eX8iDo4_blFwPJnuUVNYhQLcZKibXKx1tRJ56DkebLM7bjMh3HAk971WpLnGodXuANY_9zJQ1qMaahTAk_veiCBdWkuwQuJrQ1kjQWghd_H4jGPuxHkgIR4eZAIiQNkY0xR0wfWcXTP2HkkYjpiNi3vkQ3FJRAZlV2u8okJVohbZ1152mjY9G1YytWSqXsYG1nhgyANIMzcS3PdTl4888baqUMzA8yTvale1UdZ1IUbCwcJzYoZY4ow5noYPRMA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzH32ZUm9-wfKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We can never find meaning for our country in an overseas country. As I write this, I'm mindful that in South Africa, we have different cultural backgrounds which often force us to see things differently. We often feel like 10 nations forced to live alongside each other. We have always been a country of blacks and whites, fighting over this and that. We were never really a country of human beings. In his quest to see South Africans living as one irrespective of race, colour or cultural backgrounds, the late president Nelson Mandela  encouraged us to embrace the concept of a Rainbow Nation. When one takes a look at a rainbow, one realises that it is made out of different colours exiting together peacefully - all the colours are glued tightly to each other. The pride and beauty of a rainbow can be seen from a distant afar with all the colours gladly embracing one another.  Perhaps it could teach us a thing or two. This, I believe, was how the big man imagined we would live like. But from the look of things, it seems the concept of Rainbow nation has hit rock bottom. Some  like it, some despise it. However, It was indeed going to be a nice concept had it found a place in all our hearts. The aim was to make us see ourselves as humans. Once you see another person as a human being, it is the beginning of good things to come. It changes you internally.We have became a far too divided nation and have left each and every one of us to deal and worry about their own problems.  At the root of this huge divide is the desire to accumulate material things. We are a society that places a lot of value on materialistic things that we even forget that one day we will die and leave all of it behind.I vividly remember how life was growing up. Eating or sleeping at my neighbours who were not even related to me was not a big deal at all. The community used to share all they could. There was hardly any crime or even fear to walk at night except, of course, for the fear of witches and spooks. It was easy to feel as one and to have a sense of belonging because South Africans and black people in particular, used to wake up looking forward to a similar goal on a daily basis; and that was to be free from apartheid.  We had our differences as blacks but this one strong goal of seeking freedom united us and made us see each other in the same class humans. But then freedom came and classification based on material acquisition and standard of living emerged.  Among ourselves, we started to have lower, middle and higher class citizens. This made our problems separate. We started to fight different wars and battles and as such division was born.  It was no longer possible for me to sleep or eat at my neighbours anymore.  The sharing and caring of one another vanished and we were all left to deal with our own problems. This, mind you, happened during the time when Mandela was trying to unite us with other races under the umbrella of a Rainbow Nation. If we could see ourselves as different then how possible was it for other people to see us as one?  Hence the rainbow project never really gained momentum.BUT after president Cyril Ramaphosa's state of the nation address speech, there was a renewed sense of belonging in the country. We all felt like we belong to South Africa and that South Africa is ours.  It then made me realise that it is possible for this nation to rejoice at a common purpose. Based on that, I sat quietly and thought honestly  that if we can look deep within ourselves we will definitely find at least one thing that can unite us. We need that one thing we can all wake up to on a daily basis. If we put all our differences aside and work towards finding that one little thing and then turn it into a 'South African Dream' where every individual will aspire to make it work and believe me we will be a prosperous nation. There will be less crime, racism, discrimination, poverty, unemployment and all these other social ills causing a divide among the people of this beautiful nation. We will most probably spent the rest of the day working to make South Africa a great nation, economically and socially. Who knows, maybe even those who own land might feel the need to just share it out of the love with those who lack it. Unity is the power. We must take pride in being a united nation. The official website of the Universal White Brotherhood on the Philosophy of Unity says Unity is the Law of Life. It advises us not allow division to take hold within us because this state, in which two contradictory thoughts or desires pull us in two directions, will leave us confused and disjointed. To avoid this dislocation you must create unity within yourself.I quote: ‘Unity’ means that all parts of the periphery are harmoniously linked to the centre so that the balance necessary for the manifestation and conservation of life is maintained. Unity is the law of life: atoms, molecules, organs, limbs, individuals, countries… everything, in its own way, must converge towards a centre, and must even cling to it so that it cannot be swept away by adverse currents. In ourselves, we may call that centre God, but it can also be a very high ideal or a vocation. Those who fail to link themselves to the centre by means of their thoughts, feelings, and actions create within themselves a state of division which, even if it is only momentary, leads to disorder, conflict, and separation.”
