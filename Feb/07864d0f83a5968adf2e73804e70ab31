His worried mum, Nthabiseng Khanye (48), got worried when Lawrence failed to return.“I received a call from Boitumelo asking where Lawrence was and I was puzzled because they left together. I thought he was on his way,” she said.The family have been frantically searching for their son since the day he went missing.She said she waited for hours but Lawrence never returned home and was never seen again ever since that fateful day. Boitumelo said she was also worried by Lawrence’s disappearance.She said she suspects Lawrence was abducted by the two men she saw approaching him at the taxi stop. “While we were waiting for a taxi, two men stood across the road. After I got into the taxi, I saw them crossing the road, heading toward Lawrence,” she said.She said she had never seen the men before. “I don’t know what they would want from him but it just doesn’t make sense how he would disappear like that,” she said. Nthabiseng said: “We’ve been to hospitals and mortuaries around Soshanguve, but he’s not there. I think they might have thrown him somewhere,” She said Lawrence was a friendly person who didn’t have drama in his life. “I wonder what they would want from him because he doesn’t work and doesn’t have money. Why anyone would hurt my son when he was a very humble man, he wouldn’t hurt a fly,” she said. Rietgat police spokesman Stephan Maluleka confirmed that police have opened a missing person’s case. Nthabiseng’s hope of finding her son lies with faithful SunReaders. Anyone who has seen Lawrence is asked to contact the nearest police station.
