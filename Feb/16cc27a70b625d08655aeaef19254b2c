A clear decision on President Jacob Zuma’s fate as head of
state is now urgent, ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte said on
Tuesday. Duarte said the ANC's national executive committee (NEC)
needed to put to an end to speculation around Zuma's future, as its decision would
bind all members.Zuma's possible recall has divided the party, from it's
leaders to its grassroots members. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssZInOgbmrVF3zcbLcqSNEhak-axu7Wu8XDVWfjo9Qcfon_z2FGHq7ngAb_w5NEm5IK6C4qZocxxNtvIiXC1pDRytc398zd4wpIHdZ3BvVQHOkpH24wVY2N92VahnLoWFTY3WVFfqfXqSeujPvYMARaVzRQp0W4d4qcG0sURXfvwMx8JW0tQC9CZFdFyLm0SUGjSdLxMJ-jNhKqIbYaV_7fOE1qfKnwhQFfwyrvoPmnOlzP8c1VH-1KpSgPtDGpOq39I0ur_e6HgUKwUMWybfaoAX-3070\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBw2V50R1sXSEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Wednesday after Zuma refused to step down voluntarily."The inability of [the] NEC to have a decision has
already had an impact on members on the ground, creating confusion, indecision
and is creating what we saw on the streets of Johannesburg yesterday (Monday),
which we don’t accept."So it is important 
that we [NEC] have a clear decision that will guide everyone, without
question or negative speculation," Duarte said. Pro- and anti-Zuma protesters clashed outside Luthuli House
on Monday.Another 'Zuma Must Go' protest by ANC members, which had
been planned in Pretoria for Tuesday, was cancelled following the national
working committee’s (NWC) decision to hold an NEC meeting. Duarte said she expected a long night of debate, as the NWC
was also divided on whether to recall Zuma. "There were different views. There was a dominant view
in NWC, but it wasn’t the only view," she said. 'Vote of no confidence is not desirable'Duarte would not be drawn on deliberations between Zuma and
the top six on Sunday at his official home in Pretoria. She said, however, that
Zuma was taking the "matter seriously and understood the gravity of the
matter".Sources told News24 that Zuma told the top six that he had
done nothing wrong and was undeterred by threats of impeachment and a vote of
no confidence set for February 22. "[A] vote of no confidence is not desirable under any
circumstances. We don't think South Africans wish for us to embarrass the
president of South Africa. That has been the intention eight times," said
Duarte.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/decision-on-zumas-fate-is-urgent-duarte-20180206
