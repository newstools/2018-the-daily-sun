An erection is the process through which the penis becomes rigid enough for penetrative intercourse.Not being able to get a satisfactory erection is called erectile dysfunction (ED). While ED tends to be more of an issue in older men, it is not uncommon for younger men also to have erectile problems.Most men aim for an effortless, rock-hard erection, which is most commonly measured using the angle between the penis and your legs.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Erect penises can point upwards, straight ahead or downwards (and anywhere between), depending on factors like the tension of the suspensory ligament, the level of arousal – and of course one’s age. Individual size, thickness and shape also have an effect on the angle of an erection.Another factor is that many penises aren’t 100% straight, but curve upward, downward or to one side. This is quite normal and a slightly bent penis is no reason for concern. However, scar tissue in the penis, usually caused by injury, can cause it to bend more severely. This is called Peyronie’s Disease.Age and angle18 yearsAt this age, a man will have rock-hard erections without much stimulation. He will also be able to get hard and ejaculate repeatedly.
