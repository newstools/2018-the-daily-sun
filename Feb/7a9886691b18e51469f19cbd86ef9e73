"credible" information that he planned to fire Ramaphosa and replace
him with the former African Union Commission chair.According to The Presidency, the allegations on Zuma's ethnic
mobilisation are equally unfounded.Meanwhile, on Tuesday night there were other reports that Russian
President Vladimir Putin would be visiting the country on an official visit.However, the Presidency labelled the statement, that was
doing the rounds on social media as 'FAKE NEWS'.Certain media outlets didn't verify the authenticity of the
statement and ran with the story, which they had to retract later on.
