Professor is back with more good music to sing along to.The Durban kwaito star has returned with his fourth studio album titled Composed by Jesus Christ.Professor last released an album in 2014.His songs have always had an element of praise and worship, so it is only fitting that his latest album reflect his deep love for God.When he recorded the album, which was released by his newly established record label Proper Files, he wanted to remind his fans that Jesus is the one responsible for their success.Professor told SunBuzz a big part of the reason he released an album was because he wanted to thank Jesus for everything He’s done for him.“I don’t make gospel music, but I still saw the need to remind my fans to put Jesus first in everything they do,” he said.“Lots of people like my music, so you can imagine how many listeners will be reminded of Jesus’ power when they play the album.”He said Composed by Jesus Christ encourages listeners to praise the Saviour.The award-winning musician said some of the best artists in the country were featured on the 15-track album.“I worked with the likes of Cassper Nyovest, K.O, Mpumi, Oros and Character,” he said.“Collaborating with other artists helps me sharpen my skills because I am also a composer and a producer.“Those roles require a lot of creativity.“That is why most of the songs I am featured on are hits.“I released this album at the beginning of the year because I want it to sink in. “I want to give my fans a chance to listen and understand them.“I know that by December everyone will be enjoying my album.”Professor worked with former Ukhozi FM newsreader Jabulani “MJay” Sibisi.In the intro, MJay asks him to tell his fans how Jesus Christ helps him make music.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstsi8Z0dvRKkPAua42VcXKwAMSaZv57Fj-oCVT9HZKBGvVP45S-9rXqH4LP_w4rsoFmeyFWMbwplqZwDljUlQnnBaTgAx6cxUmjSa5eIBdELDQqPuO1DcB6hWlUKk78r8fVsqMtZ9cqeAjAeB9D2hO9LU5WvC2VU8vG1E7RD34-LjhzpcaJEL7pagITX-aFcAqTil30p3nh0LjsNtRUVl0p__SyjlZHAej9SkPOkmm16tqKKvsHmsO3DChxGhiKvjPFfvEkRMMgi79Z9tg65Yr5JUbTFhEJEr61dA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPDcCLjh019vEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
