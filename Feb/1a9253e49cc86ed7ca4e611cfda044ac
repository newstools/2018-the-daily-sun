Kaunda said: “In a bid to improve road safety in the province we have started talking to magistrates and prosecutors about the importance of imposing harsher sentences on negligent drivers.” The latest accident comes less than a month after a Pietermaritzburg family of eight were killed on the N2 in Umzumbe when their VW Golf crashed into a bakkie. He called on law enforcement agencies to leave no stone unturned in investigating the case.  “We will ensure that those who caused this tragic crash face the full might of the law. We will soon visit those who were injured to ensure they get the necessary assistance and the families of the dead,” he said.  KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that eight counts of culpable homicide were being investigated by the Ibisi Police Station.  “A total of eight people died on the scene, including the taxi driver. The cause of the accident is yet to be established,” she said.
