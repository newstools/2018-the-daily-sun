In November last year, he shared his talents when he cooked a special meal for the elderly in his area. Pitso told the SunTeam he had been cooking for over 11 years and was inspired by a friend when he was still a teenager. Today, residents of Phokeng in Rustenburg will see Pitso in action at an event called PI Kell’s Rest, School Shoes, Uniforms and Pads, which aims to raise funds for poor pupils. The event will be held at Lucky’s Pub and entrance is R180 per person. The money will benefit kids from poor families. “Growing up I had a proper school uniform. Seeing young kids going to school with no proper uniforms breaks my heart,” Pitso said. “What’s even worse is that some of the girls can’t afford pads. “The event will ensure they are treated with dignity.“As people living with disabilities, we shouldn’t let others take us for granted.“Disabled or not, we all have a role to play in society.”
