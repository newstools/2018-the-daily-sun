The film ruffled feathers, resulting in the suspension of screenings at two Eastern Cape cinemas. Commission spokeswoman Gail Smith said yesterday that those against the film believed it was a false portrayal of ulwaluko. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsupBUw00hUpfK907LIvMLExXl8n53Voe_kXSxU0wgWKdvi-J8xM8laVyZtlXYbISE5-42I8BS7R3OGG_O2u9UsAoWqKAfA5rcNrhQJqF7ByM2iQb9-8S_M1sdK2ySxuOFcWj6PAVaKwJZmfBNuxDNqigf985ROJ-Mvc5kR548WyHG5poO6Etusv9Zxnpa8DQRpVkZ36gdOvjX-JCez2ip6vYl8lQPia3k_JeG0HNf0rd6bGR9_qtcIyO1MUrLw5MSLkqROhrYfQXgK4KMxJA023AqWZSVGZJyBRWw\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YQMVDxysJE133itzvUmssYThux-FSZ9xA2m23LaBJskdVO4Jj7n7pIxQBJu66hF1aitIasrswA2cuHLQHSkR1Le6X_FJGDaqNniwgTV\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP_psAznp-rHEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Smith said the Constitution recognised people’s right to freedom of expression.“Where expression of this nature has to be limited, it must be shown to violate the rights to equality and dignity before it may be prohibited in our law.” The CRL Commission received a complaint from Xhosa King Zwelonke Sigcawu and ruled that the film was blasphemous to sacred rituals of initiation. – NEWS24
