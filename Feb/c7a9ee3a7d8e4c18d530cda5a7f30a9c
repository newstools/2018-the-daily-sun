I mean I am struggling, when people are out there selling their music because of my face and the fame I've worked hard to get. I'm sad this is happening, it is already a hard struggle to sell my music without this happening,” she told the publication.Skolopad’s album was meant to be titled Tloboneng but no word as yet whether she will change it now that it’s tainted by the piraters.If u see anyone selling a CD like this please report it He/she is doing a fraud .I haven't release it.Thank u????A post shared by  Queen Skolopad (@skolopad_sa) on Feb 22, 2018 at 3:13pm PST
