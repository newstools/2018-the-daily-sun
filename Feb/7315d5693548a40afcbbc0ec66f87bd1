It flowed too strongly and she disappeared under the murky waves.Heidelberg police spokesman Captain Thivhulawi Tshilate said the woman’s body was found on Monday after a search.An inquest docket was subsequently opened.“The body of the deceased was removed from the flooded stream by the Benoni Water Wing after a thorough search,” Tshilate said.“It’s alleged that she had been on her way to visit her boyfriend at around 4pm when she tried to cross the stream unaware of the strong current and she was swept away,” said Tshilate A family member on Saturday reported her as missing to the police.“A search and rescue team was dispatched on Saturday to look for her, with no success,” said Tshilate.
