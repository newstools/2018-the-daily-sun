GOLDEN Arrows are on the verge of clinching another MultiChoice Diski Challenge title, to make it two MDC titles in the space of three years. But only victory on Sunday will ensure they clinch their second title when they take on Orlando Pirates at Tembisa’s Makhulong Stadium (12pm). A steady stream of MDC players in the fast-growing Arrows reserve side have been promoted to the first team, a fact that makes coach Vusumuzi Vilakazi very proud, as he stresses after every season.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstPJxpBq5kSioV_bJwU0847Rl17XAxL8FWSr_1VN78xV1ZfCsg0ihex9mCKu3PbkYbD6lryzY-j6lXSfNOmhklc0sXpbCSN1IboZtEhVpRpFO4W-44rhuEZb-r7C_tPhRKffCWTGRd-ERGcbGycFoM2OjpiQzVPQe8akaX40MOovA6qMOGKvNdDYURPVABMESspP-LkPutqN9ovjWVLtmW9FtEtbkia8yv9zJWSSZLsSGE9xWMKhLwP-KfMYZmfOkXoWCbeRsrI-5WOxCVV\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDJIkPFJE7u9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Both were impressive on debut.Arrows go into this weekend’s crunch encounter with 29 points in the bag, knowing that a victory will see them return to KZN as the new champions.But facing the Buccaneers, who have a group of youngsters who give their all on the field, such as Yanga Baliso, Siphumelele Mbulu and Grant Peters, won’t be easy.Arrows are also aware that last season’s runners-up Bloemfontein Celtic, who are second in the Diski standings with 25 points, are waiting to pounce on any potential mistake by them in the last two games.
