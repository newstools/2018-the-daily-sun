SARAPHINA Mabuza loved her husband Zakharius very much. And just before she died in 1985, she asked her family to bury her husband on top of her at Avalon Cemetery in Soweto. However, when Zakharius died last month the family put him in his own grave in a new cemetery along the Golden Highway – and now the gogo is haunting her children from Zola 3 in Soweto. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Saraphina’s son Themba told Daily Sun: “Bad things are happening. Things are not going right because she is angry.“But it’s not our fault. We went to the cemetery to make arrangements, but we were told they could not help us.“Our mum was a prophet and we know she senses what happened. Her husband is lying far from her and we fear the worst.” Themba said when he and his family tried to make arrangements for his father to be buried with his mum, cemetery officials said they would have to change the date of the funeral or be given a new grave. “We wouldn’t postpone the funeral as it’s taboo in our culture to do so. We are not happy with the treatment we received from Avalon,” he said.“Our failure to go along with our mum’s wishes has brought us trouble. Things are not going well for us and we believe it is because our mum’s wishes were not carried out. We want Avalon to rectify this.” Joburg Cemeteries manager Reggie Moloi said he would contact the family to find out what had happened.
