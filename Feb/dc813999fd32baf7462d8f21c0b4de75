FRESH from a seventh round stoppage victory over the vastly experienced Osborn “Big Daddy” Machimana to claim the South African heavyweight title, Ruann “The Giant King” Visser is preparing for another battle. The 27-year-old Visser knocked out defending champion Machimana in the seventh round in a one-sided championship contest at the fully packed Emerald Casino and Resort in Vanderbijlpark on Friday night. There will be no rest for the Meyerton-born heavyweight champ, as he is gearing up for another scuffle. Visser will be part of an African team competing against their European counterparts in an international professional boxing competition in Australia on 16 March. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv-YMq6DDk91o2_QkOR4bKvxu2RRwuqr-7AJBiZELg7KI5eue37zJvMPsZZkldHhRkYPpoDgrPN3uNFctK0waASbBfd-emBpique2Jdz3fZIFh694DtvuD7weN8litYf6MDuj6z4ucSNyBehUnnmgqpVxTJvpwC1M6VuvEd3dIGP8cKvTIktTIjuE3A9O-_WPwUbKUg8XB-SBe8-IFjjo-iqHvtJuh3HjfO-4E_DtJKwlvF2-slctF9dZm9WkcIx5SkzfhD8AaM2xR9AkwD\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHlaQSSYVdsDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He added pressure by moving forward. It was a good strategy, he followed his coach’s game plan,” he added.Kalokoda said they were grooming the youngster to be a big name in the division, that is why they brought in the American trainer. Ali Bashir has trained some the best heavyweights in the world such as Lennox Lewis, Alexandra Ysyk and Wladimir Klitshko.
