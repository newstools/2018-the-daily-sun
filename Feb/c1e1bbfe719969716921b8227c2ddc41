I heard Njabulo suddenly got swept away by the water. That was the last time his friend saw him.” Thobile said many crocodiles have been spotted in the river. “It feels like a horrible dream and as if somebody will wake me up. I believe it’s better to find the corpse and bury it. That would give me closure.”KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed Njabulo was still missing.“The search is continuing,” he said.
