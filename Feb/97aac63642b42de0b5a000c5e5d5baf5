The management alerted the cops. Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa said the doctor would be reported to the Health Professions Council of South Africa for his alleged misconduct. “I am saddened by these allegations. “It’s difficult for me to comprehend how a professional, entrusted to look after our vulnerable patients, could commit such a heinous act,” she said. “Although we are allowing the cops to do their work, we must send a strong message to our employees and community members that sexual assaults are human rights violations and should be strongly condemned.” Ramokgopa said the department had stopped using the services of the doctor with immediate effect.Police spokeswoman Sergeant Tshepiso Mashele said: “The doctor allegedly raped the victim while examining her.“Cops are investigating a case of sexual assault.”
