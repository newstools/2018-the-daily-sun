THE Premiership big guns could be guaranteed of Nedbank Cup quarterfinal berths after some kind draws last night.Of course, nothing is guaranteed in football but very few would bet against 13-time League Cup champions Kaizer Chiefs losing to National First Division side Stellenbosch FC, or Mamelodi Sundowns capitulating to Eastern Cape-based ABC Motsepe League outfit, EC Bees.But it’ll certainly be a tricky outing for Orlando Pirates after they were paired with fellow side Cape Town City.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssSbpoDHcaxiCg8WdKudE2Dnf6LJ0PgW-70dPsnNxjP5csFfkPQbFqPVppZB1qq6lin76zblF9G19wUm0pXKtsY2sTEMEqF1wX3LvtxGKH_KZbSZ3bdY-dHrkmyw2DIvn7AaQhrIcC5xfSHlDtKDiJ3UhObCMYxT1OQyUlCu7Ir1eOstu-K8M1RvSvHbSs_gGIiAoAGerhNr3K6ArQSJvn6NhwzGtJ8YRz2v3xTwDsm7qZeOT0Dbm8OPlW2HetktWG_rC2qp94DNTT9m1K-KW8KhBWywwsFKpc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJkP-SA6hOUVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We’ve improved a lot as a team this season and we have a team strong enough to challenge for cup honours.”City defender Vincent Kobola said; “When the season started we said we want to win one cup. We missed out on the MTN and now we are targeting the Nedbank Cup.“Pirates are on form currently but we’ll compete. We are still in the running for the league title and we are looking at both this competitions for success. We have the squad to compete.“Our coach is a fighter and we want to help him reach his potential as a coach.”There were gasps of disappointment when the bug guns avoided each other.But another interesting clash will be between all PSL sides, Free State Stars and Chippa United.AmaZulu, who host Ubuntu Cape Town, could be proud of themselves if they can reach the semi-final in their first season in their PSL return.
