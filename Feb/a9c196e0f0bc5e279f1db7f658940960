But we are hoping to have him for the game.”A proven goal poacher, Bacela could play a crucial role for Steenberg in their quest for national recognition in the Ke Yona tournament.The 34-year-old last played competitively at the highest level with AmaTuks, following his mid-season switch from the Buccaneers in the 2015-16 season.Established 14 years ago, Steenberg are no newcomers to the Nedbank Cup, although they have never really made a mark.They come up against Orbit College in a match which has no prospects of upsets, as the two teams play in the ABC Motsepe League.But a place in the lucrative Last 16 round and possibly a quarterfinal spot is at stake for the clubs who have no major financial backers.The tournament is also fertile ground for scouts looking for rough diamonds hiding in the lower leagues. Egos are often shattered in the Ke Yona cup, with upsets often the order of the day in SA’s version of the English FA Cup.The upcoming edition not only promises to be another exciting instalment in competition’s 11-year run, it could also revive Bacela’s career
