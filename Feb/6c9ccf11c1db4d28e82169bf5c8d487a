Although Cosmos play in the NFD, they have had stints in the top flight too.Sono is chairman and also head coach of his club. De Sa is the current Dikwena head coach and will also see to the day-to-day running of Stars after they parted ways with Cliff Ramoroa, who acted as chairman. “He is the new Jomo Sono of our football,” said Tinkler with a chuckle. “I called him and congratulated him. I wish him all the best in his new adventure. I am happy for his business partners too.“But he should also know that it will hurt more now to lose than when he was just a coach, as it is his money he will be losing!” The sale of the club has left more questions than answers for the people of Rustenburg, as they were hoping Dikwena would be sold to someone from their neighbourhood.They are worried that Stars, currently bottom in the PSL standings despite having drawn 3-3 with Chippa United in Port Elizabeth on Sunday, could be relocated at the end of the season.De Sa said decisions about the future of the club would only be made at the end of this season.Some residents in the Rustenburg area had accused De Sa of deliberately driving the team down to the bottom of the table to acquire it cheaply.But the 53-year-old has denied those accusations, as he joined the club when it was already bottom of the table.Reports have emerged that local businessman Thabo Mokgatle is challenging the club’s sale in court.
