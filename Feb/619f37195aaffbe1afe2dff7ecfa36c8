When she went to check where she had parked, the bakkie was gone. The tracking company followed the signal but then the device was removed from the car. The next day, Yolanda opened a case at Joburg Central Police Station. She told the SunTeam the week before the theft, she had been followed by a red Polo Vivo.Police Constable Constance Lelimo said no suspects had been arrested yet.
