Her vehicle had been stolen from Newtown Junction in Joburg, and now Yolanda is appealing to SunLanders to help her find it. The 42-year-old from Randburg told Daily Sun her Toyota Hilux was stolen while she was shopping at about 11am.

When she went to check where she had parked, the bakkie was gone. The tracking company followed the signal but then the device was removed from the car. The next day, Yolanda opened a case at Joburg Central Police Station. She told the SunTeam the week before the theft, she had been followed by a red Polo Vivo.Police Constable Constance Lelimo said no suspects had been arrested yet.
