WESTERN Cape churches prayed for a “Day God” and not Day Zero – “since all days are created by God”.More than 15 churches and about 45 pastors, with their congregants, gathered to pray for water at Welwitschia Primary School in Delft on Saturday.The prayer is an annual event organised by His Grace Family Church, led by Apostle Mzoxolo Oliphant.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Oliphant told Daily Sun the water crisis is real and God’s intervention is the only solution.“The solution we have is for God to give us rain for us to have water. We may try our means as people, but God is the key to this situation,” he said.Officials from the City of Cape Town attended the service and spoke about the importance of saving water.Vuyokazi Siyepu, a conservation officer at the City, told congregants that if they failed to save water now, they would suffer in the near future.
