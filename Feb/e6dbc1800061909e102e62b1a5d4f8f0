I hired her as a helper.” But the woman allegedly stole from Evelyn. “She also confessed to bewitching me and holding witchcraft meetings in my house with friends of the darkness,” claimed Evelyn.She said ever since the woman arrived at her house, she has not enjoyed a good night’s sleep. “At night I hear footsteps in the house but when I wake up to investigate, I find no one. “My health has deteriorated and my husband was accused of raping a girl (10) in our spaza, even though the kid and her family said she wasn’t raped.” In December last year, the helper got another job and left. That’s when the family realised she had stolen from them.Evelyn said: “I went to her place with my brother and found her wearing my child’s clothes.” She called the cops and they took the woman to the police station. “A cop said he couldn’t register a case of witchcraft and he let the woman go,” said Evelyn.Captain Michael Mbewe, a spokeswoman for Mamelodi East cops, advised Evelyn to come to the cop shop so they could resolve the matter.
