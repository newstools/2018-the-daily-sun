It hurts to know we are champions but have nothing to show for it,” said Mapitsi.Top Limpopo promoter Phathutshedzo Dongola says the South African governing body is failing boxers by not giving them their belts. “It is wrong,” he said. “The belt is meant to motivate and inspire these youngsters. “How can they be inspired if the belts are kept at the office?” he said.Budding boxing trainer Puis Dipheko confirmed that his two fighters, Mpho “Turbo” Seforo and Thato “Captain Charisma” Bonokoana, have not received their provincial belts. He said when they made enquiries about the belts, BSA officials said they did not have them. “My fighters always ask ‘where are our belts’. I don’t have an answer for them. Being a champ without a title demotivates these youngsters,” said Dipheko. SunSport has learnt that BSA has one belt for each province, which is taken to each tournament where there is a provincial title contest. It is then taken back after every tournament. But BSA CEO Tsholofelo Lejake would not comment, saying the body was not aware of such complaints. “Kindly note that any BSA licensee who has a grievance regarding any matter should please feel free to approach the national office or the CEO directly,” said Lejake.“BSA is not aware of any such boxers who have complaints and therefore is not in a position to comment on this matter.”
