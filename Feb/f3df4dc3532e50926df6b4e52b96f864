Cops are, however, still investigating circumstances surrounding his death and it is not yet certain that he killed himself.The goat’s owner, Meshack Lekalakala, said he was saddened by the man’s death because he wanted to resolve the matter with him. The dead man was his neighbour. “What happened is unfortunate. I wish something could have been done to save his life,” he said. He said he no longer has his goat. “I hold no grudges. I wanted this matter to be solved so that everyone involved could find closure,” he said. SPCA inspector Meshack Matlou said the man’s death was a setback in the case. He said tests to find out whether the goat had been raped were still being carried out.Temba police spokesman Constable Herman Moremi said a case of bestiality and an inquest docket had been opened.
