LEARNING you’re going to have a baby is a scary, strange and wonderful feeling for couples. But pregnancy brings a lot of problems, and not just discomfort and stress to new mums-to-be, but fathers too!As February is pregnancy month, SunHealth spoke to Sister Dorothy Mamalobo-Loti, a childbirth specialist, about the support women need from their partners during pregnancy.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>She said pregnancy is an important but stressful event in a couple’s life. And women, especially, are concerned whether the stress they feel will have some negative effect on the baby.“The positive contribution fathers make has been recognised for many years as valuable to the pregnant mother’s well-being, during labour and also to the child’s birth.”Mamalobo-Loti advised what dads-to-be and partners to do to their partners during the pregnancy and after the birth.Prepare emotionally: It’s important for dads to be emotionally ready when the baby is born. They need to prepare and learn. They should read about babies.Work together: Take time during the pregnancy to discuss with your partner how you think things will change. Talk about how you will meet those new expectations. While many women feel great during pregnancy, some experience challenges that may limit their activity and will have to rely on their partner a lot more.Check your employee benefits: Learn about the type maternity leave your company offers.Talk about your worries: We think of pregnancy as a happy time, but many dads-to-be quickly get worried about the finances they will need. Remember, getting support is not a sign of weakness.Stay healthy together: You can support the health of your pregnant partner and your baby by cooking and eating healthy meals and exercising together.Be proactive: Don’t wait, look for what you both will need in future.Planning the birth: There is a lot to plan about the birth itself. Will your baby be born in a hospital, birth centre or birthing room? Who will be present? What will you do? Child birth classes teach a lot.Be present: Your physical and emotional presence is a huge part of what’s needed to help share the pregnancy.“Don’t be hard on yourself for what you can’t do, do as much as you can.”
