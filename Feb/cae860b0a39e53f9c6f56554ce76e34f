FORMER Premier Soccer League (PSL) referee and the league’s former general manager, Andile “Ace” Ncobo, has pleaded ignorance about the SA Football Association (Safa) presidential nomination list released on Monday.In a statement that could be damaging to Ncobo, Safa said out of 53 regions eligible to nominate their preferred candidate, the former school principal received the support of only one, while the rest (52) went with current president Danny Jordaan.Safa will hold its elective conference on 24 March where a new president will be elected to run SA football until 2022 when the four-year term ends.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssk4vWSVja-_KEfktWJhPNf4L3H0tFbMRrhmYtj2vTTw8KizlFyFJv18bK8Wpr7H9QqQVIaORa0eaYsfLAA-FQ-u7d2IQxVdEks074LLeyybJbGBshmgbl6IyPr63t2jakdrpR5oFkPkwpBp4qZUjmO9CpvqMc5zSh7zGOU27CoDi98pBu5gUIvEGtItC_okcXYrYg8jqZXyV3VZQYoEz9JPf_Leg2LNzcEud3oevRpDH-FzsbClyJ85ksCLElqhc7WKpKXOfWe_6rxHGLg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDjV9UOoqtxcEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I have not received any correspondence from Safa.”SunSport has reliably learnt that Safa’s Amathole region in East London is the one that nominated Ncobo ahead of Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana, who has also been vying for the post.Nonkonyana does not qualify because he is not an official member of any of Safa’s regions.It is unclear whether, according to election rules, Safa was allowed to release the number of nominations each candidate had received, or if this will be regarded as a ploy to embarrass Ncobo.Safa confirmed: “Two presidential nominations were received by close of business on 23 February 2018 as Safa prepares for the 24 March 2018 Elective Congress to elect new office bearers.”Safa confirmed that its outside auditors KPMG, who received the nominations, said a total of 53 nominations were submitted with incumbent Jordaan receiving the majority and Ncobo only one.“The nominations have been forwarded to all Safa members and going forward, the electoral process will now be exclusively in the hands of the Electoral Committee, in this case, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC),” the statement reads.“The IEC will scrutinise the candidates as mandated by the Electoral Code to determine compliance in accordance with Article 25 of the Safa Statutes.“We shall thereafter inform all members of the IEC’s decisions following their background and eligibility checks, as required by the statutes and electoral code,” said Safa chief executive Dennis Mumble.Like this story?
