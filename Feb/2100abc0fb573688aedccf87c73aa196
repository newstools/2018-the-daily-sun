his principles.“Comrade Terror, when you went to Robben Island you were
black consciousness. When you came back you were a historical mistake,"
said Malema."It is extremely disappointing every time you open
your mouth that, that which you thought you represent you've abandoned.“You can't ask the question 'who are your people?'
because the revolution answers that question. It says the people who benefit
from this revolution are your people, the revolution that you went to prison
for."Your people are the oppressed. Who are the
oppressed? Blacks in general and Africans in particular. But consciousness when
it escapes you it doesn't say goodbye. You're such a typical example of a
person who has lost his political consciousness. But clearly, that university
of life has dismally failed when it came to you," Malema said.The motion was adopted by MPs, with some amendments being
made.
