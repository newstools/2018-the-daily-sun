CONSIDERING the turbulent times and upheaval at Platinum Stars of late, it would not be far-fetched to assume Stars would celebrate if they got booted from the Nedbank Cup. Dikwena are in a delicate position in the Absa Premiership and that’s where their prime focus should be. Their top flight status are in tatters and the axe could very well fall on them if they don’t start winning league matches.But Stars owner-coach Roger de Sa says they are not cowards and will not be like sheep to the slaughter when they host Baroka FC in a Ke Yona round of 32 clash in Rustenburg tonight (7.30pm).if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstENhuxqS732V9QwZ-TbJ3UHLXwHVaSfKBrPm9VMMXqwQbz2dgmiH2pn23C2ZtTjS0SvMoOzIaySGuvogZOeG0PZYDmJYNtURklOVC13Edc0CZMqGZShIyLcy7wq4BgkmTuFyCL5W7KI1qLsrTPC6NPyKYKGLbYUC2b-XXLnZBbYyWwEh4L3-HYtEPPFb273aRAkD2BI1CKnO82yHo_gOHn3ue1gtzUTdIkS3ZbLe5PjgeJLXwYOT3cdD-Is9PViw5rit-T_Pa7FPVkrPQnBLN46Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBAtDqFlmSkSEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>This is the pick of the four remaining Nedbank Cup fixtures to determine the 16 teams that will compete in the next stage of this lucrative tournament, which carries a decent winners’ purse of R7 million.De Sa said they were seriously interested in going into the Last 16 draw that will take place in Joburg tomorrow night.Stars are currently bottom of the PSL standings with 16 points from 20 matches, five points adrift of 15th placed Ajax Cape Town, who have 21 points from 21 games.To their credit Stars, who were just bought by De Sa and faceless business partners, looked like an improved side in their last Premiership match which they drew 3-3 with Chippa United. Tonight will be the first time Stars play at home since De Sa took over club ownership for a reported R22,5 million.Many would have thought De Sa would rest some of his best players in this match, but he’s going all out.“Some teams rest senior players in the Nedbank Cup for many reasons,” he said. “It’s normal for the teams to do this. You will find that some do it because they are challenging for the PSL title and others because they want to move away from relegation. “We’re aware of our log position but we also have an obligation to the organisers of the Nedbank Cup,” he said. “We will rest a couple of players but our priority is winning the game. The good thing is that all my players are available for this clash. “It will also be good for the players’ confidence if we can win this clash. That is why I want all my best players to play in the cup.” De Sa said he was not reading much into Bakgaga’s suspension saga involving coach Kgoloko Thobejane and its potential impact. Macdonald Makhubedu, Baroka assistant coach, will assume the coaching role until Thobejane’s DC on 26 February. Thobejane is suspended after allegations that he consumed alcohol with senior players and technical staff on the bus after their 2-0 defeat to Free State Stars two weeks ago.“They are a good side and this won’t affect their form,” said De Sa.
