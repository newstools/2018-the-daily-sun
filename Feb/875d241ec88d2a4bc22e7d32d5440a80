He will peruse it and advise on the way forward in due course," NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku told News24 at the time.Last month, just hours before his deadline, Zuma submitted representations to the NPA.The representations relate to a Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) ruling which dismissed Zuma's and the NPA's application to appeal a North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria ruling that the dropping of the corruption charges against him by then NPA boss Mokotedi Mpshe was "irrational".Mpshe dropped the charges, based on the so-called "Spy Tapes", which were presented to him by Zuma's legal team.The tapes were made up of recordings of telephone conversations between then Scorpions boss Leonard McCarthy and former NPA boss Bulelani Ngcuka, which Zuma's legal team claimed showed political interference in the decision to charge him.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/concourt-reserves-judgment-in-npa-boss-saga-20180228
