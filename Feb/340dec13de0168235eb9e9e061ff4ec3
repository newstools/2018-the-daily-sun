Daily Sun published the story of Martin’s death last Tuesday.“I went to the nyatsi’s house in Dewetsdorp to fetch my husband’s belongings but she said she would give them to my in-laws,” said Nomcebisi. “She wants me to agree to bury my husband at her house even though I have my own. “She slept with my husband but that doesn’t give her the right to demand his body. “I have enough money to bury Martin. “I’ve already instructed the mortuary not to let her see my husband’s body.“She is also not allowed to come near my house. “I will bury Martin where I want. “She is the nyatsi and I am the widow.”Mpakeleng Makhetha (36), the nyatsi, said: “I asked Nomcebisi to bury my boyfriend at my in-laws’ house but she refused. “I will never go to her house because she uses muthi. Martin left her three years ago and came to me. We had a child together.“I’m asking her to allow me to bury my boyfriend at his home.”Martin’s brother, Pepe Moshoiu (54) said: “My brother was no longer living with his wife at the time of his death. We must stop fighting for his body.”
