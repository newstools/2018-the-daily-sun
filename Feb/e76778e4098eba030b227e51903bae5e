He didn’t leave a suicide note.His cousin Lebo said Banele was a quiet person who never bunked school.“But he used to tell us his teacher hated him and made his life difficult,” said Lebo. “He said his teacher would sometimes mock him in class. This broke him. “We’re not happy with the treatment Banele received from his class teacher. “That teacher is mean and has to be removed. “She’s only there to destroy kids.”He said Banele’s classmates had also told them how mean the teacher was.“One of the pupils said he dropped out of school because the same teacher treated him badly,” said Lebo.“We want the department to do something about this teacher,” Lebo told the People’s Paper.“She’s destroying pupils instead of moulding them.”Education spokesman Steve Mabona said officials would investigate the claims.Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha said an inquest docket was opened at Tembisa cop shop.
