IT would be a huge gamble, but Cape Town City FC coach Benni McCarthy is tempted to throw his youngsters in at the deep end this weekend.This could help shake underperforming veterans from their slumber, he reasons.Youngsters such as Shane Robert and Zukile Kewuti greatly impressed McCarthy when they helped City beat Swaziland’s Young Buffaloes 1-0 (2-0 on aggregate) to advance to the Caf Confederation Cup first round on Tuesday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuvm8Ft86XIZ1WLa1qqZdtGxiPw2-lt9B8NhtvZXXWRIry0x-OKNqv1pUDOTBw1reVcyvEK3qYn_Yb_dkvQ9925UdKxagSt8WJeUbQXSdr1mgqujBVAtKLBB4oP25BKJUdWM6VBJJfP1vsSFyoNeWTltutT8LjnmtSJEVOHbb232w3-D6ntezcUVs3hzaKYIL6TnWoiS9QEPz46dHbHzu5Z5mfbC7wQMXY17i3E1TFRSwLQ5CIwt7t3EMs4rp2QQXoxZ-KxxBooqLNWsp-Y1v1ghA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHx2hNlxlbOeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We will see on Saturday.”McCarthy has already outwitted Hunt in four games so far this season.Yet he warned against overconfidence, which could cost them.“Wits are slowly but surely picking up, making steps forward down there and gaining confidence,” McCarthy said.“You can never be too confident when you’re up against ‘Huntie’. We’ve given them four hidings so far and a fifth is highly possible. Of course, losing three matches on the trot has been a dip. “We can’t afford to have another dip at this crucial stage of the season – when we can see the finish line getting closer and closer. Yes, I want to make it five out of five. But it’s not going to be easy against the determined Hunt.” The Citizens haven’t scored more than one goal in a match in 13 games, having last scored two against Maritzburg in December.Said McCarthy: “It gets a bit frustrating when you are standing on the sidelines and see your team create numerous chances against every opposition, but still not scoring goals. I honestly don’t know what to do any more.”Like this story?
