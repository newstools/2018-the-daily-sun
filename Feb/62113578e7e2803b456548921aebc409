They want municipal surveyors to investigate. Mzwakhe said he was cutting grass when he discovered the hole. “At first I didn’t take it seriously even though I noticed the burned grass around it.“After a week I realised the hole was deeper compared to the first time I saw it. “I immediately informed my neighbours, who were also concerned about it.”They reported the matter to the ward councillor. “The councillor came to see it and was just as shocked as we were,” he said.“He promised to report the matter to the municipality so that surveyors could come and investigate.“Until today no one from the municipality has been and the hole just keeps getting deeper.”Resident Thembelihle Ngcobo (55) said she was born in the area, but this was the first time something like this had happened. “We fear that if anyone falls into the hole they might not survive because no one knows what’s inside.” She said residents, especially kids, have been asked not to go near the hole. Councillor Zama Shezi said: “I informed the municipality to send surveyors to the area, I’m still waiting for them to respond.” Nquthu municipality spokesman Thokozani Nyandeni said: “We’ll send environmental health to check. We’ll also report the matter to the agriculture department. “They will definitely receive assistance from us and the collective departments.”
