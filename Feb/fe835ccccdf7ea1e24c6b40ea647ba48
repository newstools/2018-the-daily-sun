call from her family members in Mozambique who gave her the report on the man
who was mauledÂ  by lions in South Africa.It's report that the three suspected poachers were attacked
by a group of lions and during that incident, Baloyi was mauled by lions. The other two managed to escape the attack and fled back to
their home country, Mozambique, who then reported the ordeal to the family. The police are still investigating the possibility that the Baloyi
might have been a poacher, after a hunting rifle and ammunition were found in
the vicinity of the scene.
