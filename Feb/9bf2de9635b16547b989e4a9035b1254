THE family of two children has been living a nightmare since the kids were kidnapped last Sunday, in the early hours of the morning. Gabisile Shabane (13) and Nkosikhona Ngwenya, who is 15 months old, were taken from their home in Hlalanikahle extension, Emalahleni, Mpumalanga. Three men entered the house through a window and pointed guns at the family. Annah Shabane (50) said when the men first came in, she thought they were just common thugs. She said her family believed the men took her daughter Gabisile for muthi as she lives with albinism. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv86oQLRhBqhw_UfGkw5arLxQi4-aWRVX3xSrcn8mQYTnLoEP0_ioZGmSQt7wWGrI1L6eH9BOjW4QPFG3yOMDg21zFXVeFxC0QoeYwijPfdmxIXzXQ1NasA6x0VPJ-9DS2WSm8OdkkCNhxOrEoHaeGJ0dcxIQ90kIFIxXFXyU5Loi7BJUaupTUgU86i4HZkcGrmzeloht6CjpML52WCn6NgqX0qZzXWNtispKZn4-IMsY_K9IDnXJ_9fuSvlnKGpo0OFzJoUpZ3TPFVgt3s9GuJHgU1pQM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFgJZpJYS61REAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They overpowered me and came in,” she said. “One man went straight to the bed where my daughter was sleeping with her son. “They took my grandson and my little daughter away. We tried to scream for help but the neighbours didn’t hear us.” Nompumelelo Ngwenya (18), little Nkosikhona’s mum, said when she refused to hand her baby over, one of the men grabbed him. “The one who took him spoke English in a foreign accent. I believe my little sister was taken for muthi. We are still shocked by this incident.” Annah said she was worried about what the kids were wearing as they were both naked when they were taken away. Police spokesman Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said cops opened a housebreaking case and two kidnapping cases. He said cops were still investigating and no arrests had been made.
