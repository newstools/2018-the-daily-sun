VETERAN musician and actor, Vusi Shange has passed on at his home in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni on Friday afternoon. Shange died at the age of 63-years-old. Nickname 'Mr. Electricman' Shange died after complaining of catching flue and being weak. His son Cebisa Nxele (37) described his father as a man who loved his family and everyone around him. Cebisa said his father complained that he was not feeling and he thought he was catching flue.  “On Friday, he did not go to the gym because he told his friends that he was weak. Later on the day around five in the evening, he went to bath but he was found dead in the bathtub,” said Cebisa. He said the family called the ambulance and when officials arrived, they certified him dead. As a family, we are shattered. He said that since the death of their mother in 2004 my father has been the man providing for everything for his family. “He loved everyone including his extended family. “Everyone was his child to him,” he said. “My father had a beautiful soul. He was calm and kind. He loved peace and was always advising his children to be strong and work hard in life.” He said his colleagues were equally shocked to hear the sad news of his passing. Dynamic frontman Shange started in The Eagles before joining seminal 70s soul act The Movers. In the 80s he signed to Hit City with Blondie Makhene and John Galanakis and released his debut solo maxi Lunch Boy and album Room Service in 1985. "His dance routine on stage reminded us the 'The Godfather of Soul' James Brown...This dance earned Vusi the nickname 'Mr. Electricman' (Mojapelo, 2008:34). He later released Teacher We Are The Future (1986) and covered Jimmy Cliff's 'Remake The World' (1988).In the 90s he joined Cool Spot, producing albums such as Zizi Kongo's Ibhandishi (1995) and as a solo artist embracing the new kwaito sound. After South African record presses pumped out hundreds of thousands of vinyl during the 1980s, LPs went into sharp decline in South African after 1992 culminating in the closure of all local pressing plants, making Move one of the last. At his death, Shenge was an actor at the Tshwane TV.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstu7w-4XBRtywgHiaznxB8gqcMiWhpei9zBWZb3hOPGle5lv4k0AFeQX4xh_UW3r_EHw0KQhwRwV-S9cjDNs9D9cUHqnw2CHhzePdOa8G1GFIOA7JcyELoOGhCtbfYaR2STTrcNcpsFSI7Ct3wEycDg-W9lvAGnuzR6uXtolUIi3UBCYFShEJxcpxVcqPqOhinGG64TmzHlricJf5rqBQnx_YnW9M6uKse7wUTmyRHnEsh353IPrOT9T5mvU0PLA8bIWoytyrCcOdXoFOSvegddtnN8Y0w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP3LMGzflcK1EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
