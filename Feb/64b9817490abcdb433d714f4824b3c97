CAPE Town cops confiscated water from a car washer on Friday and gave it to a resident. They inspected car washes in four areas to see whether they were complying with water restrictions. The car washer in Delft had several buckets of water, despite advertising his business as waterless. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstGIDShUI74uzMm9L59tU2gmlBo1Q5kjsPPAnwOSuGTVr0IW6CT3npm9F8jQH4dAUkOmRCMeJaAzjTTmLh4WgKmfHv9ccBDNGG2x3m2vp23D6QgYROgmQA4R-lsn7k__3gpAJDMd6_K6-SI7tOI_XjpocFOZWe1aGNHo2lUPvsCkUUx9hHK0f1sTdHWaH2CAo8ST7v0oXldpe3EHZTh_Tq7bktaonMAcZ9HoYGxuk6qDFhQR5PfyCFQmemyl3eOmuD_QEEP8A7PN7ronAIw5FUwUvjFCHc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKJ7DkGkKBFwEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But officials didn’t believe his story as the water in the buckets was much cleaner than the canal water. They confiscated it and gave it to a resident. The upset car washer told Daily Sun: “This water doesn’t belong to the City of Cape Town. “They had no reason to take it. This is not fair because, instead of robbing people of their hard-earned cash, I’m doing something legal.” Law enforcement spokesman Wayne Dyason said during the inspection, fines amounting to more than R82 000 were issued. He said car washers might be getting water from sources other than the municipality but were failing to produce evidence of where it came from.
