She said the same mob had earlier blocked the R510 road into Rustenburg with burning tyres for unknown reasons. Taxis were unable to leave the rank and shops had to close. Police dispersed the crowd with rubber bullets and teargas. The crowd that attacked the man apparently said it was in revenge for the murder of a taxi driver on Tuesday night. They also claimed he had drugs on him. However, the police said the man who was killed was not a taxi driver and that he was shot by police responding to a burglary after he opened fire on cops. The suspect and five others had apparently been travelling in a minibus and the community assumed it was a taxi. Cases of murder, possession of an unlawful firearm and possession of suspected stolen goods were opened.
