Investors run away from our country because of crime. Crime is killing us. We must do something and not just talk. “Fighting crime starts with me. Play your part to help South Africa lure more investors so that we can create jobs,” Afonso said.The event was attended by the army, correctional services and the traffic department.Sam Mashinini, Free State Police, Roads and Transport MEC, said thugs should feel the heat.“It is time to get Satan out of our lives! If you think you are not seen while committing crime, we are on your heels. We won’t allow anyone to do as they please here because everyone should live freely. We are also watching those using our daughters and sisters for prostitution.“If you are a foreigner, hold on to your documents, because if you don’t have them, all hell will break loose. Don’t come and destroy our country,” said Mashinini.
