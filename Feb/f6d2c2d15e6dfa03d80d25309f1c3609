Are you listening?Depression or a constant feeling of sadness is one of the leading causes of teen suicide. Depression is not unique to any class or ethnicity and it affects children as young as seven years old.Myths vs facts:- I never thought it would happen to my child.- Victims always communicate their feelings, thoughts and plans before their death. Pay attention!- Suicide is a result of stress- The inability to deal with pressure, a break-up or abusive home can leave children vulnerable to feelings of suicide.- Suicide is for people who are selfish and weak, not those who are smart and successful.- It doesn’t discriminate. Those who attempt suicide see it as the only solution for everyone. Suicide doesn’t end your pain. It just passes it on to those who you leave behind.Choose life and LIVE!#plzcall 083 323 1023 mizzb@lovelife.org.za or Facebook: loveLifeNGO
