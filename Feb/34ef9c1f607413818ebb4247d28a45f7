Puleng Molete, another one of the high achievers, said she was an orphan and lived in an outside room with her sisters. “I’m happy I went to the child and youth care centre because I never went to bed on an empty stomach. “The centre provided us with daily meals and food parcels,” she said. Mayathula-Khoza told the pupils never to be afraid to ask for help from the department. “We are very proud of you and hope you will use this opportunity wisely. Keep up the good work and work towards better futures for yourselves,” she said. She said the department was very concerned about drug abuse and toddler deaths at early childhood development centres.She said they were working hard to tackle these problems.
