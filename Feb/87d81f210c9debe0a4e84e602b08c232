Magistrate on Friday highlighted to the court that the visual evidence
presented to court indicated that the speed limit sign was visible on the road,
the road was straight and there was sufficient lighting for Pretorius to see
the JMPD officers clearly.Pretorius’s
attorney claims that Pretorius was on medication, which may have contributed to
the high alcohol levels in his system.However, he
did not produce any evidence to support this statement.The
attorney also argued that by not locking Pretorius up, it would be beneficial
to society, “as it will lessen the overcrowded prison facilities.”MMC of
Safety Michael Sun said that the City welcomes the court’s ruling.“We are
glad that the accused will be secured to attend court and face the charges.“The
Executive Mayor, Herman Mashaba , and I want to commend SAPS and the state
prosecutor for ensuring a solid case was presented in opposing bail.We
will be patient to see the judicial process through to its conclusion and are
confident that justice will be prevail".
