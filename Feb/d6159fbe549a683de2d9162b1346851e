They can only do so much. At least if I get a grant it will take care of my needs,” he said. Elias said he worked for an asbestos company for 17 years and was infected with TB. “Getting proper health care has never been easy since I don’t have an ID,” said madala Elias.Mtsheleni Ndlangisa (56) and Elizabeth Ndlangisa (36) said they had done all they could to get their madala an ID. “We once took him to the Mozambican embassy but there we were told they could only assist him with a passport. That doesn’t help because he doesn’t remember where his home is,” said Elizabeth.The madala said he would die a happy man if he were to have an ID.Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said madala Elias was in the country illegally. “After 1994 people from outside the country were given an opportunity to apply for citizenship. “Because of his age he can apply for immunity and then the minister will decide his fate.”
