It ploughed straight into nearby shacks, destroying two and damaging others. It didn’t end there, as the invaders went on to destroy traffic lights, burn tyres, uproot trees in the road and attack vehicles. As usual, Golden Arrow buses and delivery trucks were targeted.People who live in RDP homes said they are gatvol of land invaders causing disruptions.“The people trying to occupy these spaces are from the Eastern Cape and have big plots back home.“We’re sick and tired of these people. The only thing we have to do now is to fight back because they are disturbing us. They are attacking our cars. They need to go back where they come from,” said a resident.Philippi backyarder Nomvula Sikhomo (38) said they would invade every space they see because they were tired of renting.“We have been singing the same song since last year and now we are taking action,” she said. One of the invaders said they don’t understand why the city destroys their shacks in space that nobody uses. “The city of Cape Town is just full of nonsense.“They should allow us to build here because we don’t have money to rent anymore. “That’s why we want our own spaces,” said the resident. Safety and security mayoral committee member JP Smith said: “We’ve had days of co-ordinated land invasions on several sites around the city. Enforcement services and public order police have been preventing them. The city has been flooded by calls and reports from residents in Mitchells Plain and Philippi who were concerned about it.”
