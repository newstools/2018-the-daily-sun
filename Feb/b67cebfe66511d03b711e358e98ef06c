ANOTHER prominent University of Pretoria athlete, Clarence, Munyai, has been embroiled in a Tuks Athletics management politics and racial fiasco.Last year, IAAF World Championships and Olympic silver medallist, Luvo Manyonga, left the institution for Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, after claiming racism and bad treatment.The lanky long jumper left Tuks Sport in the cold, fresh from winning his world title at the World Championships in London last year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvzDcO5FLZ5WyDt61jlW8YPuM7fv-AEz5MrX9wu1V57QQrQIVzODZBmy39hSkO0c7diWjX6n1vmVKoHUBlirInfbQ8yTBFhs6UiIQI315FbuhMRjaJsZaaxt30ow7lblKG4KWsBf-AlQph3OG0VyRyIPgxj0Q001Qu0mniZeQtCJjBvEvUZcyl6sy_Mq1KYJH2rm9lbJPC_h9trAgFzPJfZYRvvrPYRLmu5aUX_IXOWPfr9Rub-aAlLOZDkW1oB1t8luYk45e0Yu4sK-wzy\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCqsV-8WN5lXEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I won’t entertain such. We’ll make Munyai understand his role because he’s talented,” Sutcliffe said.Tuks management said Munyai lacks discipline  and they won’t allow athletes to do as they please.Sutcliffe and Tuks athletics manager Danie Cornelius said Munyai was getting big-headed.The athlete refused to shed more light on the matter, saying he insisted on leaving the HPC and that he was not forcefully removed.Munyai said: “Yes, I have left Tuks athletics. Our relationship was already damaged beyond repair. That’s all I’m going to say.”A source close to the HPC told SunSport athletes are unhappy with the treatment and many have been forced to leave.Athletes who have done well on the world stage, including Olympic medallist Caster Semenya and Olympic silver medallist in the long jump Khotso Mokoena, also left the world-class training facility in a controversial manner.Cornelius said: “Munyai gives us problems. He’s just too big for his shoes.”Sutcliffe added: “Clarence has not left. It’s just that he’s ill-disciplined. You can’t have an athlete who has not achieved international stardom make us dance to his tune. He’s sponsored by us and we pay for his food and accommodation.“He has a contract. He just can’t up and leave just like that. Until such time when he has achieved at the highest level we’ll listen to his demands. He wants to choose races and all that.”Tuks won’t have a disciplinary hearing for him, but promised to give him a tongue lashing for his recent behaviour and attitude.Like this story?
