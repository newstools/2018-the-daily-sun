The mine worked around the clock to restore the power supply in order to rescue them."[They have been trapped for quite some time now and [are] quite fatigued, but they are in an area that is ventilated," Wellsted said on Thursday evening.He added that they had been in constant contact with the miners, who had access to food and water and were in no danger.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/rescued-sibanye-gold-miners-receiving-medical-attention-after-being-trapped-underground-for-over-24-hours-20180202
