Mzansi superstar rapper Nasty C recently released his sophomore album titled Strings and Bling and it seems to be winning him fans all around the world. One of those fans happens to be US singer songwriter and rapper 6lack (Pronounced Black) who took to Twitter show love to Nasty C’s new project. The Atlanta born rapper tweeted “Strings and Bling” with a number 1 medal, which presumably means he was impressed. Nasty C, whose real name is Nsikayesizwe David Junior Ngcobo, signed a record deal with Universal Music Group four months ago after parting ways with Mabala Nose. The 21- year old has been vocal about his desire to break into the international market and it seems he is well on his way to achieving that. @6lack Thanks for the love G. ???? #StringsAndBling A post shared by  STRINGS AND BLING OUT NOW (@nasty_csa) on Jul 12, 2018 at 1:44am PDT
