A FAMILY is living in constant fear of being electrocuted. This is because water seeping from a communal tap has been flowing over izinyoka wires and into the home of gogo Nompumelelo Mbolekwa. The 63-year-old from Booysens Park, next to Vastrap squatter camp in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape, told Daily Sun the foundation of her house was also being washed away. The gogo, who lives with her family of 10, said she had reported the problem to the municipality many times as she was terrified her grandkids would be electrocuted. “The water has been leaking for many years but it only started coming into my house two weeks ago. “The water is also affecting two of my neighbours’ houses,” she said. The gogo’s neighbour Truwin Goezaar (27) said the water was damaging the wall around his house and its foundations. “Municipal teams have come three times but they have done nothing,” he said. A squatter camp resident said although they had sympathy for the affected families, they would not allow anyone to take away their electricity. “The municipality should find a way to fix the problem while leaving our power alone,” said the resident. Nelson Mandela Bay mayoral spokesman Sibongile Dimbaza said: “According to an artisan that visited the site, the water leak came from a broken communal tap in Vastrap squatter camp . “Our meter division needs to isolate all the live electrical cables before any action can be carried out on site. The matter has been reported to the relevant department.” He said although it was unfortunate that the problem was reported many times before any action was taken, he believed there was a valid reason for this and was waiting for his team to look into the matter.
