Fortunately, it happened as I was about to go home. “I had already packed my bag so I just grabbed it and ran out. “I could see death approaching us. “It was dark and we did not know what to do.” Another resident, Ngazibini Nqumeni (27), said his belongings were destroyed by flames. “I do not know where I am going to sleep.
