TAXI owners stepped in to assist cops as protesters from Driesik, Orange Farm shut down the Golden Highway yesterday. They were forced to lead negotiations between cops and community members who were demanding that community leader Sibonelo “Msholozi” Zuma be released from prison. Gugu Mdlolo (26), another community leader, told Daily Sun the chaos could have been avoided if the police had co-operated with them. “On Monday, a truck full of cakes was looted. All these people want is for Sibonelo to be released,” said Gugu. She said she asked cops to intervene before there was more damage but they didn’t. “The community now thinks I sold them out to the police because they were fired on with rubber bullets. “Some of them were already attacking me. I have never been so scared in my life,” she said. Resident Michael Makana (33) said Sibonelo was arrested for crimes he didn’t commit. “He was on a five-year suspension when he was arrested. Now all these cases will cause him to rot in jail. “We went to court on Monday and his case was postponed for the third time. “We warned the community that protesting will only make things worse for Zuma but they didn’t listen,” said Makana. Police spokesman Kay Makhubele confirmed there was a protest on the Golden Highway. “The protest started on Monday when two trucks were burnt. No arrests were made and investigations are underway,” he said.
