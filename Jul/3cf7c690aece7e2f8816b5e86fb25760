KHOISAN activists in Port Elizabeth celebrated Nelson Mandela’s centenary yesterday by burning their ID books. The group of 30 Khoisan descendants gathered outside the Port Elizabeth City Hall in the morning before going to Donkin Reserve. There, they burnt their IDs in protest against being called coloured. Led by Eastern Cape MPL Christian Martin, they said they were echoing what Nelson Mandela did when he burned his dompas on 28 March 1960 in protest after people died in Sharpeville. “The dompas system prevented free movement of black people under apartheid,” said Martin. “We burnt our identify documents today as they reflect racial classification. We aren’t coloured people.” Martin said government should change all documents that classify Khoisan people as coloured. “The term was created in 1950 to deprive the Khoisan people of their freedom so they could not get title deeds. “They were also deprived of benefiting from government projects as they were viewed as people with no race.” Chief Crawford Fraser said: “According to the Population Registration Act, a coloured is a person who’s not white, nor a native. “ This means coloureds are not from South Africa or Africa. If we’re not from Africa, then where are we from? “This is why we’re serious about this term. Because we’re being marginalised and discriminated against.” Fraser said they’re Mzansi’s original people and had told Home Affairs they’d apply for new documents that didn’t label them coloured.
