KAIZER Chiefs are racing against time to have their coach Giovanni Solinas get his work permit on time to sit on the bench against Mamelodi Sundowns in the Shell Ultra Helix Cup at FNB Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Club manager Bobby Motaung told SunSport yesterday that the Italian had yet to start his job in Naturena as he didn’t have a permit to work in Mzansi. This means Patrick Mabedi will continue to be in charge as he guided Amakhosi to successfully defend the Bokone Bophirima Maize Cup in Orkney at the weekend. Chiefs beat Free State Stars 6-5 on penalties in the final after the teams drew 1-1 at full-time, having registered a 2-0 win over ABC Motsepe League side Buya Msuthu in the semifinal. Explained Motaung: “We are in the process of applying for Solinas’ work permit. He is not conducting training sessions at the moment, but we hope he will obtain the permit soon.” Motaung emphasised that Solinas would need to hit the ground running to appease Amakhosi fans who are starved for trophies. He hopes the new Chiefs jersey launched yesterday would inspire players to restore their glory days. Chiefs failed to win a single trophy in the past three years under coach Steve Komphela. Added Motaung: “Every game is about results and at Kaizer Chiefs there are no friendlies for us. We need to give respect to our fans. Although it’s pre-season we must take this game serious and that’s why we always arrange high profile matches.” The outspoken boss is delighted that new recruits Khama Billiat, Virgil Vries, Kabelo Mahlasela and Letlhogonolo Mirwa have blended with the rest of the squad having made their debut in the Maize Cup. “I am happy with the players we signed. We didn’t only sign for the sake of it, but we were strategic as we wanted players who fit well in the club’s structure.”
