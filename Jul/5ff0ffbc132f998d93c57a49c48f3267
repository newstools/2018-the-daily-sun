T HE father of a slain ANC Youth League leader wants cops to investigate why his son was murdered. Bongani Mkhize (25) was shot and killed by two men at Umlazi V section, south of Durban. A witness told Daily Sun that just before the shooting on Saturday, one of the men had been provoking Mkhize and accusing him of swindling him out of R500. Mkhize, in return for the supposed bribe, had apparently promised to help the attacker register at the college where Mkhize was a student. Bernard (67), the father of the dead man, said he didn’t believe his son was murdered because he owed the suspects. Speaking outside the Umlazi Magistrates Court yesterday, Bernard, who had travelled all the way from Impendle near Pietermaritzburg, said his family was still in shock. Two brothers, Andile (24) and Mfanafuthi Zulu (29), have been charged with murder and illegal possession of a firearm. ANC supporters and students from the college packed the court. Among the people who were present at the suspect’s court appearance were Youth League regional secretary Thinta Cibane and Sithenjwa Nyawose, a municipal council official. Mkhize was a ward 88 branch deputy chairman and the college’s Youth League chairman. Sbonelo Nzimakwe, an SRC president at the college, told Daily Sun: “We suspect there’s another reason why Bongani was murdered. “We don’t want to say it was political, but we’ll leave it to the police to do their job.” Both suspects are being kept in custody, ahead of a bail application on 30 July.
