ROBERT Marawa is back on the airwaves. The SABC yesterday announced that Marawa was rejoining the public broadcaster yesterday to present a sports show on Metro FM and Radio 2000. He is expected to be accompanied by Beverly Maphangwa, his producer. SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said all contractual issues between the organisation and Marawa had been resolved in a peaceful manner. “The SABC looks forward to having Marawa back on board to deliver another dose of award-winning sports programming.” Marawa said: “I see this as a continuation of a journey with the SABC. “It proves the leadership of the public broadcaster is committed to fulfilling its mandate. “This high level of support is important to me. “I want to deliver the kind of show that the listener deserves. “With this historic simulcast option, we hope rush-hour traffic frustrations will be a thing of the past.” Simulcast refers to the process of airing a radio and television show on two or more channels or stations at the same time Marawa’s return to the airwaves was halted by several contractual issues that almost derailed the deal. He left the public broadcaster last year due to a disagreement about the suspension of his producer. Tbo Touch, the owner of online radio station Touch HD, offered Marawa a job last year, but he declined because the station was not the right fit. He also turned down an offer from Power FM. When Marawa’s return to the airwaves was announced, scores of social media users congratulated him. ) Sithembiso posted: “This was long overdue.
