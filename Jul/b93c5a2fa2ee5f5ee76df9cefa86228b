EMERGING farmers from Zaaihoek in Mpumalanga said the agriculture department’s broken machinery is delaying production. During MEC Vusi Shongwe’s visit to the area yesterday, they told him the department’s faulty machinery delays ploughing and reaping. They said their machines aren’t working and when they report it to the department, nothing is done. Maize farmer William Thlapi (41) told Daily Sun he had to buy parts for the broken equipment. “I sent a letter to the department but there was no response. “I then decided to buy the parts from the little money I had so I could fix the machine myself and continue my work,” he said. William said the department should ensure its equipment is updated and in good condition before it is given to the people. “We are dependent on these machines. “It is useless for us to receive equipment that does not work. “That is why we fail to continue with production the way we should. “We lose a lot of money if we don’t plough in time,” William said. Shongwe said the department is working on a system that will help it to deal with all of the farmers’ challenges. “We are here because we came to identify problems delaying your production processes. “We will solve them one by one but would like to urge farmers to take good care of the equipment we give you because it must be used by others too,” Shongwe said. Fewer than 20 tractors out of 200 in the area are in working order.
