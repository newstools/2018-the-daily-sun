WEALTHY mums are spicing up their sex lives by poking in
unusual places – sometimes with more than one person at the same time. According to the findings of an annual survey of mums
based in the wealthy suburb of North Shore in Sydney, Australia, strange locations
for poking include graveyards, car bonnets, public schools and golf courses. One claimed to have had sex on their in-law’s dining room
table, while another liked it on the boardroom at work. There’s also an appetite for having sex with older women,
having threesomes, masturbating in the bathroom at work, having affairs and
fantasising about ex-partners during sex. “The best sex was
with my ex boyfriend. I am still loving him. Lots of time when I had sex with
my partner, I visualise my ex. Also when I masturbate alone, watching porn, I
often visualise my ex,” wrote one in the North Shore Mums survey. But not all the mums are having super-revved sex lives. One wrote: “I’ve gained weight, I’m too tired and my mind
is running with things to do. I’m more likely to have sex if I have had a few
wines. I do have a sneaky masturbate about once a week though.” Another said: “I can’t be bothered. I would rather sleep.
I am saggy and don’t like the way I look. I find it hard to believe that he
finds me attractive.” Several also wrote about the shock of being bust poking
by the kids. “My daughter walked in and stood there and then asked why
is mummy’s head down there going up and down (while she is doing the movements
with her head) … I wanted the ground to swallow me up, I was beyond mortified,”
wrote one mum.
