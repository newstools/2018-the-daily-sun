WHEN Nomusa Ngcobo found out she owed the Msunduzi Municipality R220 000, she scratched her head in disbelief. Nomusa 44), who lives in an old mud house in Sobantu kasi in Pietermaritzburg, said she found out about the huge bill last month. She said before then she had never received letters informing her she was in arrears. Nomusa told the SunTeam: “I don’t know how the municipality came up with the figure. “It’s too much for a family of six that lives in a mud house. “My family is not big and we only use a reasonable amount of water.” She said her family had received letters from the municipality over the years but ignored them because they weren’t addressed to them. “The letters had names of people we didn’t know,” she said. “We thought the letters were for people who lived here before the previous owner sold the house to us in 1999.” She said she regretted not taking the letters to the municipality. “If I had asked the municipality what was going on, maybe I wouldn’t be in this situation.” Nomusa said she had no idea how she would settle the debt. Msunduzi municipal spokeswoman Thobeka Mafumbatha said the high bill was for rates, refuse services and water consumption. She said there is no problem with the billing system. “The meter is being read monthly,” she said. “The water usage on the property is rather high.” Mafumbatha said rates payments haven’t been made since 2014.
