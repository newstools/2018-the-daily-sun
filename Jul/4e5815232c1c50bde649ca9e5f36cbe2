THE charge against a taxi driver who allegedly attacked a Metro cop last Friday has been changed from assault to attempted murder. The suspect appeared in the Joburg Magistrates Court yesterday, where he was granted bail of R1 000. The case was postponed to 24 August. NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwane said the charge was changed after more information was gathered from witnesses who saw taxi driver Khulani Dludlu attack cop Nompumelelo Salley. She said more charges could be added. Joburg Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar welcomed the decision. He said Salley was still in shock over the incident and was recovering at home. The incident happened in Houghton, Joburg, while officers were directing traffic. The taxi driver allegedly smashed into the Metro cop when she stopped him. When he was ordered out of the taxi, the driver apparently locked his doors and started waving his fists at officers. When he got out of the vehicle he allegedly walked to the officer, head-butted her and punched her until her colleagues pulled him off and handcuffed him.
