Local rapper Cassper Nyovest has had his fair share of unsuccessful relationships. Being a celebrity means what would normally be private does not always remain that way, and Cassper’s relationships in the past have been well documented. The Baby Girl hitmaker recently shared some solid relationship advice with a user on Twitter who has apparently not had the best of luck when it comes to romance. Cassper, whose real name is Refiloe Phoolo, essentially told the user that relationships should not be her only source of happiness. He said things weren’t always as rosy as they appeared in many relationships. “Relationships are tough,” Cassper warned the user, “They are hard work. “They might look good from the outside but best believe it’s war in that mother f*****. AH!!! Enjoy your life sisi!!! Whether you’re with someone or not. Be your own happiness first!!! That’s the way,” he added. Cassper's wise words ended up touching more than the intended target as other users applauded the rapper for his advise.
