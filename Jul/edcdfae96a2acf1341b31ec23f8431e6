MOSES Masombuka feels like a defeated man. The 56-year-old from Soshanguve in Tshwane told Daily Sun on Friday he learnt from neighbours that his wife Maggie was dead. When her family buried her on Saturday, he had to sit with other mourners because her obituary said she wasn’t married. “I tried to stop them from burying her but I didn’t have money and didn’t know who to go to.” Moses made peace with them and decided to go and pay his last respects. He said he saw his two children crying for their mum and mourners kept asking who he was when he went to comfort them. “I became a stranger at my own wife’s funeral and there was nothing I could do,” he said. He said he got another shock at the graveside. Moses said instead of using Maggie Masombuka, his in-laws decided to use her maiden name. “We have a marriage certificate and it states that she is a Masombuka, but Mogashoa is written on the grave.” Moses feels disrespected by the family. “I paid R5000 lobola. They know I’m her husband. I’m going to fight them until they change the name on her grave.” Maggie’s sister Ester Mogashoa said the couple married without their blessing and denied that he paid lobola for her.
