MTHANDAZO Mgozini can fix any kind of bicycle. The 47-year-old from Caleb Motshabi kasi in Mangaung started his bicycle repair business 10 years ago, and he’s never looked back. The father of five told Daily Sun with the money he earned, he was able to support his family. He said his love of bicycles started when he was a child and his father bought him a bike to get to school. “One day, my bicycle broke and because I didn’t have money to get it fixed, I had to do it on my own. My family was surprised that I could fix a bicycle and I’ve been repairing them since then,” said Mthandazo. “I’m now a master of my work as I can even build a bicycle from scratch, using old metal. I can make a bicycle in two days. “I do my work with love and passion. I never went to school for this work. I’m just talented.” Mthandazo said many people ekasi were buying bicycles to get to work or school. “My wife collects aluminium cans to support our kids and pay their school fees. “I have hired one worker, who comes and helps me on busy days,” he said. “My dream is to have a bigger place so I can hire more people who are not educated and teach them skills. I also fix radios, TVs and cars.”
