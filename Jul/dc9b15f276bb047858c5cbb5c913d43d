RESIDENTS from Kraaifontein, Cape Town are still shocked after a man in his 30s was gunned down outside his house yesterday morning. Nomalungisa Joni (38) said it was about 6.30am when she heard people saying they had finally got their man. After that she heard gun shots. “I didn’t look outside because I was afraid I’d be shot while trying to see what was going on.” Another resident told Daily Sun that the dead man was returning home after dropping his girlfriend at work. “It is clear that these people were following him because they shot him as soon as he got out of his car,” said the resident. Luzuko Mayambela said the dead man is from Venda, in Limpopo. “We didn’t know that he had any enemies so we are shocked by this incident. “They didn’t damage the car, they only shot and killed him,” said Mayambela. Another resident said: “This shows that they just wanted him dead because they didn’t take anything. “They waited for him to get out before they started shooting at him and they made sure that they killed him.” Western Cape police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “The body of a 33-year-old man was found in front of a house in Mangondia Street in Bloekombos, Kraaifontein. “A murder case was registered for investigation,” said Van Wyk.
