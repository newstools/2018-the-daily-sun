THE doors of court opened . . . then closed . . . and then opened again over the lovers’ tiff between media mogul Given Mkhari and his wife. This was after the Power FM and Capricorn FM boss and his wife Ipeleng were arrested on Saturday. Each separately filed assault charges against the other. Early yesterday, the couple took to social media to say they had decided to withdraw the charges. But later the same day, they both stood in the Randburg Magistrates Court to answer to charges over their counter punches. Cops said the two were taken into custody on Saturday. The couple said: “We confirm that an unfortunate incident happened between us in our home on Saturday. “We both individually reported the matter to the police. “We are now withdrawing each case to resolve the matter in the privacy of our home.” But according to the NPA, the cases had not been withdrawn and the two were still due to appear before the court yesterday. Captain Kay Makhubele, Gauteng police spokesman, confirmed the counter charges opened at Randburg Police Station but didn’t provide any more information. Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane, NPA spokeswoman, told Daily Sun that for a case to be withdrawn, the person who opened it had to go the cop shop and file a withdrawal statement. The statement would then be taken to the NPA. “The prosecutor will then check whether the decision to withdraw the cases is in line with the interests of justice, and if not satisfied, the case will continue,” she said.
