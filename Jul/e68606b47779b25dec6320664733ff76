A FORMER sex worker who retired from her profession when
she fell in love is returning to work after her relationship fell apart. According to Daily
Mail, Amanda Goff (43) – who goes by the name of Samantha X – is Australia’s
most high-profile magosha. Samantha X publically declared her life as a magosha over
and done with in October last year when she fell in love with TV newsreader Ryan
Phelan. She wrote at the time: "It is with great sadness,
but also great excitement, that after six wonderful years as Samantha, I am
hanging up my Louboutins to move onto a brand new life and new projects. "This isn't a 'I'm taking a break but I'll be back'
blog — this is it. The end of escorting for me, but the beginning of something
even more wonderful." Yesterday the mum-of-two took to Instagram to tell the
world of her “embarrassing” change of fortune. "I retired for love, then got dumped, all in the
public arena. What a loser right!! Wrong. Life is flexible, things change. Life
is a series of lessons to learn from. I don't have the answer to eternal
happiness but for me, owning your stuff and being able to live a life you truly
want to live, rather than obsessing about 'what people think' is the secret to
my smile,” she wrote. Samantha X has made a huge success of her career, having started
her own agency, Samantha X Angels. She’s also published two books about her experiences
in the sex industry, Hooked: Secrets Of A
High-Class Escort and Back On Top.
