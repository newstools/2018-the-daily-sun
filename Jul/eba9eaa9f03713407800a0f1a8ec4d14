THEIR pit toilets were built 22 years ago but residents said they still use buckets to relieve themselves. The residents of Ezimangweni in Inanda, north of Durban said their pit toilets were dirty, smelly and filled with kak. They said they haven’t been cleaned for 15 years. They said the toilets overflow with kak, which makes them sick. Sibongile Thango (35) said the toilets have been troubling them for several years and they were gatvol. “We use buckets every day and night. We then throw our kak in the nearby bushes. “Some people continue to use these toilets which then causes them to overflow and the kak spreads on the road.” Another resident, Nomusa Dlamini (45), said every councillor who’s been in office has failed to fix the problem. “We feel left out and we don’t understand why this matter hasn’t been resolved. “We want the municipality to come and fix these toilets.” Ward Councillor Thandanani Mabanga said he was aware of the matter. He said he’s reported it to the municipality’s water and sanitation department several times but nothing’s been done about it. Municipal spokesman Mandla Nsele said: “The water and sanitation unit is attending to the matter following a visit to the areas by the city’s executives. The contractor is currently on site emptying the toilets in Ezimangweni and KwaBester. “Affected residents will be advised through their respective councillors.”
