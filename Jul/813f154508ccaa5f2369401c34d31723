A SURGEON famous for butt enlargements is on the run
after a woman died soon after he injected her in her bum. According to the BBC, Brazilian celebrity plastic
surgeon, Denis Furtado (45) carried out a procedure on Lilian Calixto (46) at
his home in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday night. The procedure involved injecting acrylic glass filler
into her bum. But Lilian fell ill during the procedure. Furtado rushed
her to hospital but she died some hours later, according to cops. It is not yet clear exactly what she died from. The celebrity surgeon, who got the name Dr BumBum from
devoted clients, has since vanished. A warrant has been issued for his arrest. His unnamed wife has been arrested on suspicion of taking
part in the procedure. Niveo Steffen, president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery
Society, told AFP: "You cannot perform plastic surgery inside an apartment. "Many people are selling a dream, a fantasy to
patients in an unethical way and people, weakened, are often attracted to low
prices, without considering whether or not the conditions are adequate." Furtado has nearly 650 000 followers on his Instagram
account and appears on Brazilian TV.
