FOR 12 years, residents of A section in Siyanda, northern KZN, have been struggling to find the source of the sewage that flows in their streets. Resident Smangele Mhlongo (36) said the problem started in 2006 after RDP houses were built in the area. “This dirty water is giving us big problems. Sometimes it flows from the road into our houses,” she said. “Some taxi drivers refuse to drive through the sewage because the kak stains their vehicles. Our doors and windows are always closed because we don’t want the awful smell to drift into our houses.” Nkosinathi Mhlongo (41) said the local councillor is not interested in solving the problem. “We would like mayor Zandile Gumede to intervene because this water is a danger to our health. My girlfriend from Umlazi refuses to visit me because she cannot stand the smell. The last time she came here was in January,” he said. Councillor Mamane Xulu told the SunTeam she is aware of the matter but said residents have not made a formal complaint. “Residents must give me their house numbers so I can report the matter to eThekwini Municipality,” said Xulu. However, Smangele insisted the community had reported the problem to the councillor. Ethekwini spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said the mayor was not aware of the matter. He said: “The mayor can intervene if the community wants her to do so. “However, she will have to send a team to assess the problem first.”
