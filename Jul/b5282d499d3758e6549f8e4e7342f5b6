IF YOU are driving and suddenly your engine hasn’t the same oomph it did, no matter how much you press the petrol, there are reasons for it. Empty fuel tank Maybe it’s because you have run out of fuel. If not, it could be a mechanical or electrical issue. Low compression In order for a car’s engine to function properly, there must be great cylinder compression throughout the combustion process. If the compression is low, then the engine power will be low. Clogged fuel filter The fuel filter removes impurities before the fuel is injected into the engine. A dirty fuel filter blocks the flow of fuel. Clogged exhaust pipe The exhaust pipe has two filters: the muffler and a catalytic converter. If the exhaust pipe or any of its filters were to get clogged, the engine’s power output is reduced. Bad injectors If a fuel injector became damaged or malfunctions in some way, then the engine will not be able to generate a sufficient amount of power to push the vehicle’s wheels.
