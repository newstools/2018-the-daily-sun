JUBILATION was the order of the day for the Mogayila family on Thursday evening. This is after brothers Thabang (28) and Katleho (20) of Diepkloof in Soweto came back home after being missing. Daily Sun published their story “Brothers go missing!” on Thursday. Their parents were worried after they did not return home after they had gone to install a smash- and-grab tint in their car. But the brothers said they had just gone to visit a friend. Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, Thabang said they called their mother to tell her they were visiting a friend. “After we took the car for the tinting, we decided to visit our friend. We called the family and told them we are okay but my mum thought we were hijacked and being forced to say we are fine.” Thabang said they decided to go home when they saw their faces in the newspaper. “We did not think this was so serious, but we went back home immediately,” said Thabang. Their father, Solly, said they are happy their sons are back and unharmed. “They said they were in town visiting a friend. They were scared to come back home after they went awol for weeks,” he said. Solly told the People’s Paper his wife was over the moon. “When we went to report to the cops that the two are back, my wife collapsed at the police station. That is how overjoyed she was.”
