Department of Home Affairs Director-General Mkuseli
Apleni has resigned from his job. According to eNCA, Apleni resigned after being in the
department for almost a decade. Home Affairs Minister Melusi Gigaba is said to announce
his resignation on Monday at 11:00 in Tshwane. Former minister of Home Affairs Hlengiwe Mkhize suspended
Apleni in September 2017 on grounds of alleged gross misconduct. The suspension was overturned after it was ruled
unconstitutional. The High Court reportedly found that Mkhize had no lawful
authority to suspend Apleni. Apleni was then immediately reinstated to his post as
director-general.
