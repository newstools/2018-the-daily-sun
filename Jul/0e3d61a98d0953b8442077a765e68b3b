They started their march at Besters and ended at Sizakala Centre near the police station in E section, KwaMashu, where they handed over their memorandum. North Region Business Association leader Mandla Sibaya said they want eThekwini Municipality to remove foreigners from their kasi. He said they want the municipality to arrange licences for the locals, as they have now formed an association. “We want them to arrange bulk buying for us and want to be allowed to sell alcohol in our shops. “We also need help to renovate our shops.” Sibaya said the municipality should investigate the illegal items that foreigners sell in their shops. One shop owner said foreigners build their shops close to theirs and then compete by offering cheaper prices. “They steal our customers.We want them out. “They can go anywhere as long as they are out of our kasi,” he said. He also claimed the foreigners brought whoonga to their kasi. The marchers gave their memorandum to Sikhumbuzo Ndaba from mayor Zandile Gumede’s office, who accepted it on her behalf.
