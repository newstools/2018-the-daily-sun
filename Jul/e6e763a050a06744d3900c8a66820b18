MAMELODI Sundowns have upped in their interest in Tokelo Rantie as they look to make him their third top off-season recruit. Rantie is currently a free agent, without a club after he was released from his contract at Turkish side Genclerbirligi in January. But it may not be long before he returns to action in the Brazilians colours, pending the conclusion of a deal with the PSL champions. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane is said to be keen on the former Bafana Bafana striker, looking to further strengthen his team for the new Premiership season and the Caf competition. Mosimane has already ticked Toni Silva and Jose Ali Meza off his shopping list and is now eyeing Rantie. At 27, Rantie could still reach his peak with his unquestionable quality in front of goal. However, he has battled with disciplinary issues and his run-ins with Safa are well-documented. Without a lethal striker, the Brazilians relied heavily on their midfielders for goals last season, with winger Percy Tau top scoring with 11 league goals. Jeremy Brockie’s talent is undisputed but the former SuperSport United marksman has struggled in front of goal, going without scoring in 11 matches since switching to Chloorkop in January. Thokozani Sekotlong scored a whopping zero goals the entire season, while the club has started getting inquiries about his “bench-mate” Cuthbert Malajila. Bongi Ntuli is likely to be send on another loan spell, having failed to impress in his loan stint with Platinum Stars last season. Yannick Zakri’s future remains uncertain after he failed to return to pre-season camp following a loan stint with Ajax Cape Town. With a year left on his contract, Sundowns might want to cut ties with the Ivory Coast striker and free up a foreign spot in their squad. Together with young winger Keletso Makgalwa, Kumalo was among a few faces missing at the recent camp the team held in Rustenburg.
