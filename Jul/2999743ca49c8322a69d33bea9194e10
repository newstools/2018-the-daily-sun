ZWELIHLE kasi was on lockdown yesterday. People were told they couldn’t enter or leave the kasi in Hermanus, Western Cape after a week of protests. Last week, Daily Sun reported that elderly residents were struggling to travel to police stations to get affidavits for new Sassa cards. This was three months after the local satellite cop shop was burned down. There has been chaos in the area since residents started protesting against the arrest of a community leader who had taken down a fence they claimed separated black people in Zwelihle from white people in Hermanus. Resident Nomxolisi Ndlamlana (37) said the situation was just getting worse. “As much as we want to support what is happening, it’s difficult. We are losing our jobs because we can’t get to work,” she said. Community leaders were the only ones moving freely in and out of the area. They said no one in the kasi would get any services until all arrested suspects, including community leader Gcobani Ndzongana, were released. A business owner said: “Even though we are losing money, it’s better than losing all our stock to looting.” Some residents said groceries were taken from people who had gone shopping in town. A resident said: “Those taking people’s groceries are saying everyone must starve to understand the seriousness of the situation.” Businesses owners were ordered to only open between 8am and 10am and 4pm and 8pm. Lindelwa Veco (37) said people would die because the clinic was closed and no one was allowed to leave the kasi. Overberg Municipality said on its website that all law enforcement agencies were still on high alert. Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: “The situation is currently under control and our members have been sent in to maintain law and order.” Zwelihle Stakeholders convener Masizole Mnqasela referred Daily Sun to the Western Cape Health Department who said they would respond, but had not done so at the time of going to print.
