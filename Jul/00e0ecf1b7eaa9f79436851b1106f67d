THE National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) has unveiled a tombstone for Solomon Mahlangu on Tuesday.  Mahlangu was one of the giants in the fight for liberation of South Africa. He was born on 10 July in 1956 and he would have been 62-years-old today. One of Mahlangu’s famous quotes were: “Tell my people that I love them and that they must continue the fight, my blood will nourish the tree that will bear the fruits of freedom, Aluta continua." Solomon Mahlangu was raised by his mum who worked as a domestic worker. He dropped out of school in Standard 8 (today’s Grade 10) because of ongoing riots. Mahlangu joined the ANC in September 1976, soon after the Soweto Uprising. He later left the country to be trained as an Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) soldier. Mahlangu received his MK training in Angola and Mozambique, he came back to South Africa through Swaziland on 11 June 1977 to help organise student protests. On 13 June 1977, Mahlangu and two MK activists, Lucky Mahlangu and Mondy Motloung were confronted in Goch Street, Joburg by police. During the battle that followed, two who were passing-by were shot and killed. Lucky managed to escape, but Mahlangu and Motloung were arrested. The two faced two murder charges and others under the Terrorism Act. Deputy Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Thabang Makwetla said Mahlangu was an outstanding symbol of patriotism. “Comrade Solomon Mahlangu’s trials and tribulations cannot be captured adequately, by one speaker at any one time.” ”The bravery that he displayed is just unparalled,” Makwetla said.
