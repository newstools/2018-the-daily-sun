It’s hard not to be blown away by Zethembiso “Zethe” Mdletshe’s voice. The 25-year-old Afro-jazz and soul singer from Empangeni, KZN invited the SunTeam to the launch of her extended play titled Qhawekazi. The launch was held at The Orbit jazz club in Braamfontein, Joburg on Wednesday. As soon as Zethe stepped on stage, the venue came alive. While a good voice is often the only thing musicians have to offer, this is not the case with Zethe. Her great singing is accompanied by rhythmic dance moves and an arresting stage presence. Many words can be used to describe her performances, but boring is certainly not one of them. Zethe said she has looked up to her father since she was a little girl. She attributes her love of different genres to her father’s unique taste in music. Zethe said her dad used to listen to musicians like Oliver Mtukudzi and Celine Dion. She recently won the Vodacom NXT LVL competition. Although her father died last year, she said she continued to draw strength from him during her time on the NXT LVL stage. She said a friend saw she was destined for success and persuaded her to join the competition. Zethe sent a 45-second audition clip and hoped for the best. The singer progressed to the audition stages, made it the top 20 and was called to Joburg to record the show with four other hopeful musicians. After a gruelling five months in front of the camera and fighting to get her name up from the bottom of the leader board, she was given the opportunity to showcase her talent on the NXT LVL stage. After taking part in the competition she released Zazi, the single that introduced her to music fans.
