IN MZASI, as it is in Africa, magic is a part of life, whether you believe in it or not. Traditional healers and sangomas are a part of Mzansi life, and while many feel they are only a cultural decoration, there exists a dangerous underside to culture as well. Over the last few years one vile practice is growing: people are being murdered for their organs for use in secret ceremonies. Like any social movement, it has its own fads and the latest victims in the sick muthi murder market for people with albinism. Recently SunWellbeing was invited to a discussion and private viewing at the launch of artist Lee Hempson’s powerful new body of work, Skin Deep, at Eye Art Studios in New Doorfontein, Joburg The five-year-old gallery has embraced the issues of women’s murders and albinism. They aim is give a voice to those who cannot speak for themselves and show shocking images to a society numbed to violence. In these works, Hempson confronts the ritual murder of people with albinism because people claim their body parts have a powerful or special magic that can be exploited for money. Skin Deep reflects on this outrageous belief by highlighting the implication of our physical identity on our lives. Inspiration for these works comes from the abduction of a 13-year-old girl albino girl and her baby brother from their Mpumalanga home in the middle of the night. Their dismembered bodies were later found burnt in a swamp. But the cruel plague suffered by people with albinism is not only prevalent in South Africa – it has spread like a disease all over southern Africa and it needs to be stopped so no more people are murdered.
