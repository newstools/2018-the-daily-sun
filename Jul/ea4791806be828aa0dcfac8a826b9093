BEING a university student can be emotionally, physically and psychologically draining. The pressure of performing well and surviving in the tough environment has pushed many students over the edge. Some students become depressed and end up committing suicide. For this reason, Grades and Levels SA has launched a 24/7 counselling hotline with the aim of addressing the staggering suicide rate among students. The initiative, in partnership with the student body, the South African Union of Students, was launched in Randburg, northern Joburg on Thursday. Clinical psychologist Mthetho Tshemese stressed the need to address mental health issues among students. “If you come from an economically challenged background and can’t afford to be at a tertiary institution, you are subjected to pressure from your family and the expectations they have,” he said. Tshemese said new students face a lot of challenges they found hard to handle. He added that students are expected to automatically know how to handle matters such as finances and adjusting to a new environment. Student president Misheck Mugabe said the union fully embraced the initiative. “There has been an increase in the number of suicides and students being murdered, often in front of their peers. “These events traumatise other students who don’t get psychological evaluation and counselling,” he said.
