LEADER of the EFF Julius Malema has torn into what he labelled, “Pravin’s cabal”, saying Pravin Gordhan’s group is more dangerous than former president Jacob Zuma’s. Speaking at a press conference held at the party’s headquarters in Joburg yesterday, Malema also took a jab at President Cyril Ramaphosa, who he said was useless and overrated. “Zuma’s group didn’t know what they were doing. They were just stealing a little money. Now Zuma is bankrupt, hardly a year after he left office. “Ramaphosa is so useless, helpless and indecisive that Pravin walks all over him. “Effectively, the president of this country is Pravin. We never elected Pravin. He must not think he can do as he likes,” said Malema. The EFF leader was addressing the media on the party’s policy. He also announced that the EFF was joining forces with the Congress of Traditional Leaders of SA. He said the EFF would never allow the “Gordhan gangster mob” to replace the Guptas. He said his party was watching them keenly. He alleged the SARS rogue unit was real and headed by Gordhan. He said the day he asked Zuma why the economic cluster was run by Indians, the rogue unit was unleashed on him. He said anyone who challenged Gordhan and his group should expect scandals dug up about them. “They have done it to me. I am not scared of Pravin’s cabal. I am not scared of the Indian cabal. The cabal destroyed the people in the United Democratic Front. And you call Pravin progressive? We have no problem with the Indian people,” Malema said. Talking about Sassa and the Post Office issue, Malema said if Ramaphosa continued to be so indecisive, it would make Bathabile Dlamini and Zuma look like heroes.
