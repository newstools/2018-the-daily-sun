GOGO Zodwa Twala is the oldest member of the Boxing Grannies. The 82-year-old who attends the gym in Cosmo City, Joburg told Daily Sun: “The programme keeps my body fresh and healthy. I’m free like water. I live alone and I can clean my own house without a problem.” Gogo Zodwa joined the programme in 2014. “Boxing is a great sport and I don’t have complaints about my body anymore. The youth should exercise regularly to stay fit and healthy,” she said. According to coach Claude Maphosa (40), Boxing Grannies is all about boxing and fitness activities. “The gogos train twice a week for 90 minutes,” said Claude, the owner of the A Team Gym. He said they have 30 members in Cosmo City and the gogos are often invited to corporate wellness days where they show off their skills. “Boxing releases toxins and is a friendly sport. “You use your body to control movement,” said the former boxing champion. Gogo Gladys Ngwenya (77) said: “Exercising improves the strength of my muscles. “It helps me to walk long distances as people did in the past.” Gladys said she does not have joint and back pains any more. “I feel young again!” she said. Gogo Busisiwe Kheswa is the baby of the group, at 63. She joined the group last year. “The programme keeps me busy and helps me spiritually. My body is strong and I don’t take any medicine.”
