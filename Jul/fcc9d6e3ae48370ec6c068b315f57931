HE was taken out of school before completing his grade 12. Not because he did something wrong, but because he doesn’t have an ID. Amukelani Chauke (21), from Mashao Village outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo was unable to continue in the grade 12 class in February this year due to his ID problem. Amukelani told Daily Sun of the pain he endured when school management removed him from class. He knew then that his dream of becoming a teacher was doomed. He said: “It was sad. Even today I still feel the pain as I stay at home doing nothing while my peers chase their careers.” Amukelani said his mum died when he was four years old and his gogo, Rosina Chauke, raised him. But his situation became desperate when gogo Rosina died in 2013 after a short illness. “Gogo told me I had no birth certificate when my mum died. My mum wasn’t living with us at home. “Gogo was unable to register for my birth certificate as Home Affair officials demanded that my mum signed for me.” According to Amukelani, his gogo tried everything in her power to get a birth certificate for him after his mum’s death. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola confirmed that they received Amukelani’s inquiry through Daily Sun and that the provincial manager would look into the matter.
