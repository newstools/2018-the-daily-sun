LIMPOPO cops are continuing to sweep the streets of criminals. On Monday morning, the cops bust 476 suspects and recovered stolen goods, including four vehicles, during Operation Fiela. The operation, which started on Friday, was made up of public order police, K9 units, border policing and crime prevention units. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said their aim was to trace wanted suspects by conducting roadblocks, patrols and stop and search checks. “This is our second Operation Fiela and we are committed to continue fighting crime. The police have strategic approaches and they have produced positive results,” Ngoepe said. The arrested suspects are aged between 18 and 56. Ngoepe said they were bust for crimes such as murder, business robbery, house robbery, armed robbery, contravention of the Immigration Act, and possession of unlicenced firearms and stolen motor vehicles. “The suspects will appear in different magistrates courts soon.” Limpopo police commissioner General Nneke Ledwaba praised the cops for making the arrests. “We applaud the police who were on the streets since Friday, ensuring that the province is a safe place to be,” he said. The incident happened after the suspects were evicted from the land they had occupied illegally. The land belonged to the Polokwane Municipality. The suspects appeared in the Seshego Magistrates Court and were released on a warning. In Musina, a traffic cop was bust for attempted murder after he shot a victim in the stomach. The incident happened after an alleged argument.
