DURING the cold winter’s night on Friday, madala Toma Tshose (64) went out to collect firewood to stay warm. But what he found froze him in his tracks. The madala stumbled on an old mlungu’s grave that had been dug up. Toma told Daily Sun he found the open grave when he went to look for wood at Skoongesig Farm on the Lindleyspoort Road near Rustenburg. The grave belongs to a man named Johan Bisschoff, who was born in 1933 and died in 1980. The tombstone was damaged and the grave had been dug up. The body was covered with a sheet of zinc. Toma said he was shocked because he had no idea who did it or why the grave was opened. He didn’t see anyone roaming the area or hear anything suspicious. “I have been living here all my life and I knew this plot had a few graves on it. “There are four more graves close by to the one which was found opened. “It takes a long time to dig up a grave with a tombstone on top.” Frank Mudau and Johannes Molebalwa, whose livestock sometimes graze in the area, said they were shocked when they were told of the desecrated grave. Toma said whoever did it knew what they were digging for. North West police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh said the spot was the previous farm owners’ private burial site. Police are investigating a case of violation of a grave. Myburgh said they were still waiting for the forensic department to check the scene.
