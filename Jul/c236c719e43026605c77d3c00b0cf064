Sports broadcast, Andile Ncube has allegedly sent a letter of demand to the SABC. According to Sunday World, Andile is livid over the fact that he and Thomas Mlambo were given the boot to make way for Robert Marawa. The whole country was in shock when the SABC recently announced that Robert Marawa had been reinstated at Metro FM and that his new sports show would be simulcast on Radio 2000. This meant that Andile and Thomas, who had a show on Radio 2000, would have to make way for Robert’s new show. The publication is now claiming that Andile’s letter threatens the SABC with a R2 million lawsuit if the public broadcast does not give him his job back. This comes amid news that SABC COO, Chris Maroleng and the acting Group Executive for Sports, Marcia Mahlalela have allegedly found themselves in hot water over Robert’s re-appointment. The Sunday World reported last week that the two executives had been charged by former acting SABC CEO, Nomsa Philiso after staff members called the re-appointment into question. They claimed that the appointment did not follow the correct procedures, alleging that it was imposed by the two executives. Marcia has allegedly since resigned.
