EVERY day the call goes out: we hear that we must love our children, protect them and take care of them. But still there are those who do not get the message, and every day children are still being murdered, raped and abused. The four-year-old from Khayelitsha, Cape Town was kidnapped, raped and murdered. “She told her friends she was going home at about 4pm,” said Uyathandwa’s aunt, Zanele Manyefana. “But she never arrived. “Her mother’s house was just 600 metres away.” Her grandfather, Damelin Mvula (52), returned from work at about 5pm. Uyathandwa’s mother asked if the girl was with him. That was when they realised she was gone. Residents said they saw a man from the area dumping something in an open field. They went to his shack, where they allegedly found Uyathandwa’s bloodied clothing. The residents searched the field and found Uyathandwa’s body at about 8pm. The cops were called and the man was arrested. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the 33-year-old man will appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrates Court soon. According to Dube police spokeswoman Sergeant Tembi Nowathe, the mother argued with her son about the money and she attacked him. “He had stab wounds on his legs, hands and head,” said Nowathe. The mother was arrested. Spokesman for the Gauteng Department of Social Development, Mbangwa Xaba, said: “We will have to get more information to see how we can help.” A furious gogo said she came home to find the children in a bedroom. She asked them why they had locked the door, and they said they were playing a game. The gogo said her youngest grandson told her the boy undressed them, smeared them with petroleum jelly and raped them one by one. Kagiso police spokeswoman Captain Appel Arendse confirmed that a rape case was opened. She said the suspect was arrested and the matter was in the courts.
