HAVING witnessed Mzansi rise from the ashes into the dawn of freedom, gogo Ngwakwana Serunya (100) has an important message to share with the people and youths of today. Gogo Serunya, who celebrated her centenary in April, believes that if Madiba was still alive Mzansi would be a better country than it is now. “Mandela was an angel sent by God to bring peace to the world,” she said. “It took Madiba many years to defeat the apartheid government, but it’s unfortunate that it will take the current generation only a few years to destroy his achievements,” she said. The gogo believes that being united is the only thing that will take Mzansi to greener pastures. The centenarian from Senwabarwana in Limpopo called on Mzansi to continue keeping Madiba’s legacy alive. “The current generation needs to ensure that the poor also live with dignity,” said gogo Serunya. She described Mandela as a fearless leader who faced all life’s challenges with dignity. She said it’s a pity that she never met him but said she believed that if he was still alive, she would perhaps have had the opportunity to celebrate his centenary with him. "It was always my wish to meet Tata Madiba during my childhood,” she said. “The youth should not take this democracy for granted. They should use it to change the country for the better.”
