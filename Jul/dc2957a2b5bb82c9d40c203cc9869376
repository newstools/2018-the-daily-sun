RESIDENTS have been invading land in extension 9 of Ennerdale, south of Joburg since the weekend But their hard work was all in vain as police destroyed their shacks yesterday. Community leader Merge Cass said when she got wind of the invasion, she asked residents why they were building shacks when government was dealing with the land issue. “They said the councillor gave them the go-ahead to build shacks, but she denied the claims,” she said. Lawley community leader Siphiwe Malinga said: “The people who are invading land are not from around here. We fought to get land. Some have seen the plans that were drawn for the development of the land. They are using that information to make money by selling stands.” Joburg Metro police spokesman Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said officers demolished about 50 structures. He said no arrests were made. Gauteng Human Settlements spokesman Keith Khoza said: “Municipal, provincial and national land was analysed. The department has set aside R653 million to service the identified portions of land in the current financial year. “The identified land will not only assist in dealing with the problems of Ennerdale, but residents of Gauteng at large.” He said the provincial government will not tolerate land invasions.
