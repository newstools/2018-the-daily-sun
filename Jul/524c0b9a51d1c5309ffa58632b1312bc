TV personality Jessica Nkosi is about to be a mother for the first time and she could not be more excited. The Isibaya star who had remained mum on the identity of the father of her child, has finally let the cat out the bag. While it might come as a surprise to some, many already had their suspicions on the father’s identity. Nkosi has for the first time confirmed publicly that Ntokozo 'TK' Dlamini is indeed the father of her child. Taking to social media on Tuesday night, Jessica posted a picture of herself side by side with the Uzalo star. “PARENTS.... And no one must ask me who the father of my child is again guys please... this is the first and last time you will see him la,” she captioned the picture. The couple’s pregnancy was only confirmed a few weeks ago with Nkosi flaunting her cute baby bump on the cover of True Love magazine. She told the publication at the time that she was not trying to hide neither her pregnancy nor her partner from her fans, but rather to enjoy the moment away from the spotlight.
