IT DOESN’T matter how busy you are – it’s important to make time to exercise because it has several health benefits. These were the words of a busy businesswoman Bulelwa Mhonko (59), owner of Mkonko Removals. She established a new gym in Mfuleni outside Cape Town to ensure kasi women, and even elders, get a chance to exercise. “It keeps you fresh and young when you exercise. Gym is refreshing for both the body and the mind. It makes your body warmer as it increases your blood flow,” said Mhonko. August is the month of mothers and Mhonko said women should take it as their month to initiate a healthy lifestyle. Since the establishment of the gym six months ago, several Mfuleni people have started loving to gym but there are still only a few women who commit. Loyi Nodywele (58), who is a trainer at the gym, told Daily Sun since he is always in the gym he exercises every day. “From 8am in the morning to 9pm at night, I’m always in the gym. I have indeed seen the results. I now feel young and fresh,” he said. Nodywele said the gym was popular, but mostly with men. Mhonko said that has to end. “Women must make exercising their priority because it chases away disease.” Daily Sun spoke to Nonceba Tom (35) from Mfuleni who said she was a regular at the new gym. It’s not about a healthy lifestyle for her though. “I want to look sexy because summer is around the corner. I have gained some weight and I cannot continue to hide my body under winter clothing. When summer comes I have to show off my nice body at the beach,” she said. When Daily Sun asked about the benefits of exercising she said: “That’s a bonus!”
