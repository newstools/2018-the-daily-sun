A total of 27 schools in the Western Cape reported incidents of burglary and vandalism during the 2018 winter school holidays. This is the same as the figure from last year. One case was reported as major, while the remaining 26 cases were classified as minor. The Cape Winelands reported the highest number of cases, with seven schools reporting incidents of burglary or vandalism. Six Metro Central and six Metro South schools reported incidents, while three schools in the Eden and Karoo district and three schools in the Metro East district reported incidents. One school in each of the Metro North and Overberg districts reported incidents. The most severe case was in Metro East. Thieves broke into the school at about 8am, an hour after the night shift security guards had left the school. They gained access by breaking two burglar doors with an axe. They stole two computers, two printers with scanners, a photocopy machine, a microwave, a two burner stove, an electric kettle, a fax machine, four electric heaters and two cellphones. “While many schools were hubs of activity over the holiday period, there were schools that remained vacant and were therefore targeted by vandals,” said Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schafer. “I urge residents to be extra vigilant during the day and report any suspicious behaviour or activities they see in the vicinity of schools.”
