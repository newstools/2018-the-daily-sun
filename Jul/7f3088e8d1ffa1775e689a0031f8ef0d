OPERATIONS at KwaMashu Community Health Centre are at a standstill. Workers have downed tools and vowed to continue to protest if the KZN Department of Health continued to ignore them. Yesterday, nurses, drivers and clerks abandoned patients and protested outside the management offices, demanding a response from the department. They held up placards and sang. Patients stood and watched, hoping the nurses would attend to them but they all left without being assisted. The workers said they were angry because KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo accepted their memorandum at the beginning of July and promised to respond within seven days but did not do so. Daily Sun reported the protests. The workers said they wanted the MEC to improve security, especially for night shift staff, following attacks. One of the workers said they’ve given the department more than enough time and they demand action. “We can’t tolerate the beatings anymore. Doctors are also being beaten up now. Patients are also violent, especially at night. We don’t know what to do anymore. “We’ve come to a point where we fear coming to work. The department must come up with a solution soon and stop ignoring us,” said a worker. Ncumisa Mafunda, KZN health spokeswoman, said: “The department regrets the disruption to service delivery that arose as a result of protest action at KwaMashu Community HealthCentre. “We are aware of the issues raised and are attending to them where possible. The department is actively liaising with the relevant labour representatives. We are confident that an amicable solution will soon be found.”
