HUNDREDS of Uber and TAXIFY drivers went on strike on
Tuesday. The e-hailing service partner drivers say there’s too many
drivers added to the service and it affects them negatively. Uber drivers gathered at Zoo Lake in Johannesburg and there
after went to the company’s headquarters in Sandton to deliver their memorandum. They caused heavy traffic around Zoo Lake in Jan Smuts as some
driver partners, who were found operating were forced to join the strike. They say they will be off-line for the whole day. The also say it is not fair that they are not represented
in the board of the company, they demand to be represented
and have their voice at the board.
