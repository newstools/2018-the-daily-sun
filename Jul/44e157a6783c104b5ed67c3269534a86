GOGO Martha Simelane (58) from Rockdale in Mpumalanga will finally have peace of mind. Middelburg cops, the Women’s Network and Men for Change renovated her RDP recently and installed a bath, basin, ceiling and burglar bars. They also fixed the wiring, built a wheelchair ramp, and plastered and painted the walls of the house. Middelburg cops spokeswoman Captain Khanyisile Zwane said they helped the family because Martha was struggling to take care of her wheelchair-bound daughter Nondumiso (23). Martha said life had been difficult previously because the roof was leaking. “I’m excited because my daughter’s wheelchair will now move unobstructed in the house,” she told the People’s Paper this week. Jack Rapatsa of Puttie Trading Enterprises partnered with the cops to promote the spirit of Mandela Day: giving and lending a helping hand.
