Takalani Ligege spends a lot of time with elderly people. He said he loves hearing them tell stories of African history and culture and their tales inspire most of his art. “I’m working on a theme titled “dancing shadows” for an exhibition. “It will be an introspective look at what’s left of our inherited culture as compared to some 70 odd years ago.” Takalani told Daily Sun he was fascinated by capturing portraits of people from various spheres of life. “Faces tell stories. If you take a good look at the lines, textures and tones, you will get the story,” he said. Takalani recently painted a portrait of former president, Nelson Mandela. He said he respected what Tata stood for. He wanted to celebrate the great man he was by painting a giant portrait of him. The artist from Thohoyandou Block J in Limpopo told the People’s Paper: “It’s through the portrait of Mandela that I acknowledge what I would call his namaste spirit, or spirit of ubuntu,” said Takalani. He said it was through the spirit of ubuntu that we appreciate those around us. “This spirit helps us appreciate life and those who are part of it.” He said people could learn from Tata, who inspired prosperity and excellence in everyone without any discrimination or favour. Takalani is the director and co-founder of an online art platform called Vendart International. He’s also the Limpopo co-ordinator of the Artists in Schools project. Takalani’s artwork has been exhibited at the FNB Joburg Art Fair alongside some of the best international artists.
