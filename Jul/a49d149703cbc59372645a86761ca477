RESIDENTS blocked the entrance to Embalenhle South Hall on Saturday. ANC provincial chairman candidate Peter Nyoni was supposed to deliver the Nelson Mandela memorial lecture in Embalenhle, near Secunda, Mpumalanga but he wasn’t allowed to enter by people demanding services. There have been several violent service delivery protests in the area over the past two months. A resident told Daily Sun Nyoni couldn’t deliver a lecture while they still have issues over water, electricity and unemployment. They wouldn’t allow him to speak until all problems are solved. “People come and go in this area, promising us the world but we are still suffering. We won’t allow someone to come and lie to us in Madiba’s name.” Nyoni said residents wanted to use the lecture to raise their issues. “That was a desperate way of raising their frustrations, which are understood.” He said as government officials, they don’t have the authority to resolve all issues but said he would keep visiting residents and try to bring change.
