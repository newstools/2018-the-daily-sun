PAC member Pakana Thaisi is lucky to be alive. He was apparently nearly killed on Sunday morning. Even though he was wounded after a bullet narrowly missed his 4-5, the 37-year-old Pakana fended off his two attackers. Pakana from Orange Farm, south of Joburg, told the People’s Paper he was woken by the sound of a breaking window. At first he thought it was just his noisy neighbours having another one of their fights. Moments later, he said, a man held a gun to his head while another tried to hack him with a panga. “I pushed the gun away and fought with the panga man,” said Pakana. He said he recognised one of them. “He told his accomplice to shoot me,” he said. Pakana then fell onto the floor, and when he got up the men had vanished. He said the attack was connected to a court case he and fellow party members were part of. Gauteng police had not responded to questions sent to them at the time of going to print.
