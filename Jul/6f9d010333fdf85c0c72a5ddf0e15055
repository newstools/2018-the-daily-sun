XHOSA king Mpendulo Sigcawu believes sport helps young people stay on the straight and narrow. Sigcawu addressed hundreds of young people during his annual youth tournament at Dutywa Stadium, near Butterworth on Saturday. The aim of the 10-year-old soccer and netball tournament is to encourage young people to stay away from drugs and crime. A R21 000 cash prize was up for grabs this year. “The crime rate is very high in rural areas. We can reduce it by organising tournaments such as these,” said the king. “Young people practised for this tournament, which means they had no time to commit crimes.” Organiser Melinkqubo Ndabokutya said he was humbled by the huge turnout. “I am appealing to the public and private sectors to support such tournaments. We have to fight drug abuse and crime together.” The young people who took part in the tournament said it was something to look forward to. Gcina Tyumre (19) said: “Playing sport gives me an opportunity to refresh my mind and keep my body healthy. It helps me stay away from drugs. A lot of young people in my area are hooked on drugs, so staying busy helped me a lot. If I had not played sport, I would have been in jail by now.” Zizo Mgogodlo (15) said: “Sport allows me to network. I have been at the tournament for the past three years.”
