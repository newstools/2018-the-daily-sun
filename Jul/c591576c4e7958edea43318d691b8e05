MEMBERS of this organisation have big hearts. On Monday, Kasi to Kasi members from Petsana, Reitz rolled up their sleeves to help a poor couple. They built a shack for Ishmael Ntsane (46) and his wife, Mathoto Motloung (45). The couple had been living in a crumbling structure made of pallets. Daniel Nhlapo, leader of the organisation, told Daily Sun: “It was painful to see the family living in a structure made of pallets. “That’s why we decided to help. People shouldn’t live in such bad conditions.” Bongani Vilakazi, a member of the organisation, said a lot of work still needed to be done in Petsana. “Many people in the area are suffering. “Our mission is to change the lives of poor people for the better,” said Bongani. “We also plan to help our brothers and sisters who are struggling to further their studies at universities or colleges.” Ishmael said he was grateful to the organisation for helping them. “When they arrived early in the morning to erect the shack, it felt like a dream. “I have no words to express how I feel. I was starting to lose hope because we had lived in a crumbling structure for many years,” he to the People’s Paper. “I’d like to thank the organisation members for what they did for me and my wife. I hope they will continue to help other people.” The family was also given groceries and a new wardrobe and wall unit.
