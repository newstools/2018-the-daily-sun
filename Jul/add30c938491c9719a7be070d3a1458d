RESIDENTS said they were unhappy with the lack of service delivery in their areas. Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga hosted a public meeting with residents of Mabopane, Winterveld and Ga-Rankuwa at the Mabopane Indoor Sports Centre on Sunday. David Ratladi, chairman of the Concerned Residents Committee, said their issues were about poor service delivery, high water bills and the lack of sanitation provided by the municipality. Ratladi added that senior citizens are also slapped with shocking water bills. Diana Sello (70) from Mabopane asked the mayor why are they being treated so badly by the municipality. “My problem is the high water bill. They municipality says I owe them 7 000 for one month,” she claimed. “Where will I get the money to pay off this debt? I’m too old and I struggle to buy food for myself.” She pointed out that they have been receiving unacceptably high municipal bills ever the DA took over the City of Tshwane. Residents added that their kasis are like pigsties and there is no police visibility in the area. Msimanga assured residents that the municipality would fix the Mabopane station, flooded areas, storm water drainage problems, roads and take up the issue of sanitation. “We are working on demarcation and have started to fix mask lights,” said Msimanga. He warned that residents will be fined if they tamper with water meters.
