A MUM and dad are fuming after they took their son to be circumcised and it went wrong. The 10-year-old boy’s mum told Daily Sun her child was left with a deformed 4-5 and in unbearable pain after they took him to a doctor in Phalaborwa, Limpopo earlier this month. The 34-year-old mum from Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga said she wanted answers from the doctor. “The doctor circumcised my boy and instructed us to wash his bandaged 4-5,” she claimed. “But when we took him back for a check-up four days later, the doctor circumcised him again. “This time, my son was left groaning in pain. We couldn’t even sleep because we constantly had to nurse his wounded 4-5.” The mum said her son was left in so much pain that she and his father had to rush him to Maphutha Malatji Hospital. “The doctor who performed the circumcision said he would speak to the hospital doctors to try and fix the problem but he has been ignoring us since then,” she claimed. The mum said her son had not been able to go to school since the incident. “We reported the matter to the Limpopo Health Department but they said the doctor works for an NGO,” she said. Health Department spokesman Neil Shikwambane confirmed that the doctor was not their employee. “We know the victim was admitted to hospital on the seventh of this month and discharged on the 15th,” he said. Attempts to get hold of the doctor in question were unsuccessful as his phone was on voicemail.
