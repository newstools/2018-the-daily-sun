AN intense fire laid waste to shacks in Kennedy Road squatter camp in Durban on Thursday, killing one man and leaving hundreds without shelter. About 500 residents are rebuilding their shacks, while the family of Thembinkosi Mncwango (39) is making funeral arrangements. According to one of Thembinkosi’s relatives, the fire started in his shack. Jabulani Ntshangase (33), Thembinkosi’s cousin, told Daily Sun there was a power cut in the area on the morning of the fire. “When we returned from work in the afternoon, there was still no electricity. “Residents used candles to light their homes, while others like my cousin used paraffin stoves to cook and to keep warm,” he said. Jabulani said his cousin forgot to turn off the stove when he fell asleep. He said after a while, Thembinkosi’s neighbours saw smoke and flames coming from his shack. “They tried to open the door but it was locked. “The flames got bigger and the surrounding shacks also caught fire,” said Jabulani. He said residents tried in vain to put out the blaze. “The firefighters came and eventually managed to extinguish it. “My cousin was the only one who burnt to death. “I didn’t hear of any injuries,” he said. Lindani Ntuli (30), a resident, said the clothes he was wearing when the fire broke out are the only possessions he has left. He said the sound of residents screaming woke him up. “I couldn’t take anything because I was afraid I would burn to death. “This is a tragedy for all of us. “I don’t know how to start picking up the pieces,” said Lindani. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident. She said an inquest docket was opened at Sydenham Police Station.
