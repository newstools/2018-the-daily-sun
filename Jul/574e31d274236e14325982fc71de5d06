AYANDA Gcaba has rejected Black Leopards’ offer to join the club after having trained with the Thohoyandou side for two weeks. The player from KwaZulu-Natal said while he had a good time training with Leopards and “everyone was happy with my contribution”, there were a “lot of things” they couldn’t agree on in the contract. “With all that said, we felt it would be best for me to try my luck elsewhere. “I would have loved to play for Leopards. I think it was not meant to be and there is nothing you can do about it as a person. “The coach (Joel Masutha) was very impressed with me.” The 32-year-old former Orlando Pirates defender said he’s not having sleepless nights about finding a new team: “I am not worried about my future. One thing for sure is that I will be playing football this season, trust me. I am not stressing about getting a club. I am waiting to hear from my manager on the way forward.” The experienced defender is now linked with a move to the newly promoted NFD side Maccabi FC who have signed former Kaizer Chiefs striker and Zambian international Collins Mbesuma. Maccabi have also signed former Polokwane City defender Thapelo Tshilo who was also trying his luck with Lidoda Duvha. Last season, Gcaba struggled for game time at Pirates and head coach Milutin Sredojevic loaned him out to Platinum Stars in January. But Gcaba, who has been with the Soweto giants for six years until last month, failed to help Stars who are now relegated and renamed Cape Town Umoya FC after relocating to the Mother City.
