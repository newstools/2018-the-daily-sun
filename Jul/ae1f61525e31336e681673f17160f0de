NTOMBIZETHU Mabaso loves making people look beautiful. Since she was in high school, it has been her dream to work in the cosmetics industry. Thanks to a church bursary, she will now be able to make this come true. However, she is now appealing to SunReaders to help her with donations for food, travel expenses and accommodation while she studies. The 22-year-old from Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun she lives with her mum Philisiwe Nyawo (59) and seven siblings in a four-roomed house. She finished high school in 2013 but couldn’t continue her studies due to a lack of funds. Philisiwe supported the family with her wages as a domestic worker until she lost her job in December. Since then, the family has relied on the money Ntombizethu’s earns as a retail worker. Things started looking up for Ntombizethu when the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints agreed to pay for her to do a skincare course. Ntombizethu said she had been doing make-up for people ekasi but many of her clients took a long time to pay her or didn’t pay at all. Philisiwe told Daily Sun her daughter is very skilled at applying make-up. Philiswe said it was painful not to be able to help her daughter make her dream come true. “It would mean so much to see my daughter become the beautician she wants to be,” she said.
