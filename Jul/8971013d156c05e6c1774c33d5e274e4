BISHOP Jacob Senabe is devastated. The holy man from St Mary’s Christian Church in Mahube Valley, Mamelodi East, Tshwane has lost the side sections of the tent he uses for his services. And now his tent is incomplete without the eight white sides and three brown sides. Instead of preparing his sermons, the bishop is worrying about these things! He has appealed to anyone who has seen or picked up the black bag with the side parts of his big tent to come forward. He said he needs his tent for his outreach ministry. Senabe told Daily Sun the bag fell off his blue Ford Cortina bakkie on Saturday morning on Tsamaya Road, near the post office. He was on his way to erect the tent in a local park in Mamelodi for a night vigil. “Please come forward if you have found parts for my tent. “The church has a gift prepared for the one who brings the bag back to me,” said Senabe. “If I don’t get the tent it will be difficult for me to host church services in the park.” He said God’s work was at a standstill. Anyone who has seen the bishop’s tent bag can contact him on 082 669 6994 or take it to his church at 533 Tapelo Street, Mahube Valley in Mamelodi.
