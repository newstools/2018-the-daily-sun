Murdered Uyathandwa Stuurman (4) from Khayelitsha, Cape Town was laid to rest in Kuils River Cemetery on Sunday. The dignified funeral, held at her mother’s home, was packed. Sadness was written on the faces of mourners. Her father Benjamin Mvula (28) said he didn’t think he would ever see this day. “I didn’t think I would be able to live after I heard that my daughter died. “We have three boys at home and Uyathandwa was the only girl in the family. She was loved by everyone, especially my father,” said Benjamin. The father said he is still coming to terms with the death, but thanked the community for their support. John Mvula, Uyathandwa’s madala, said he had mixed emotions. “People supported us from the first day this happened and to see so many people today makes me happy. Some individuals even sent money to make sure the burial happened smoothly.” He said he will always remember the lively child. “We spent most of our time together and played games. She was like my child because we bonded very well,” said John. Andile Gamda (33), who is accused of murdering the young girl, made a brief court appearance on Thursday. The court heard how he allegedly slit her throat and tried to dispose of the body in a dustbin. He will be taken for mental evaluation as the court believed he might not be sufficiently mentally stable to stand trial.
