THE Commission for Gender Equality has called on parliament to intervene in the fight against child marriages. Commission chairwoman Lulama Nare said 91 000 children of school-going age are married. On Wednesday, Nare told parliament that in some cases lawyers argue that it is not statutory rape if the child was not a virgin. The commission said in cases of rape, the police insist on the children speaking for themselves when giving a statement and not being helped by a parent or grandparent. Rosemary Capa, chairwoman of the department of social development’s portfolio committee, asked Nare what steps were being taken to fight the scourge of violence against children. Nare told parliament about a 14-year-old girl from Dutywa, Eastern Cape who ran away from her husband. “Her family took her back to him and asked for lobola. “We intervened and the girl is in a place of safety,” said Nare. Petros Majola of Khula Community Development Project said: “I’m aware of these problems. “These girls who are married off by their parents at a tender age are deprived of their right to education. “They cannot do their homework because they are required to perform a wife’s duties. “When they want to do their schoolwork, their husbands tell them they are married woman and their job is to fulfil the needs of the man they married.” Majola said although laws are in place to protect children, they are not enforced. He said police sometimes do not take a tough stance against people who are guilty of marrying children. “If the law is lenient towards people who practise or arrange forced marriages, we will not make a difference. “I think it is time for the law to get to a stage where they use a zero-tolerance approach to forced marriages.”
