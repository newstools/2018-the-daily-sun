THE Vaal River is filled with kak. Raw sewage has been flowing into the river for weeks, with no sign of intervention. Resident Graeme Addison said: “Sewage has been flowing into the river for weeks. I have reported the incident with no luck. “The river is bright green and smells awful.” Graeme wrote a post on social media that read: “Residents of Vereeniging all the way to Bloemhof are seeing fish, leguans and birds dying. The pollution is a serious public health risk.” He said it was unfortunate that most people in the area will end up contracting diseases from drinking water with traces of kak in it. Emfuleni Municipality spokesman Stanley Gaba said they were aware of the matter. He said: “We are doing our best to reduce spillage into the river. Unfortunately, some of our pressure pumps have collapsed. “We are in the process of repairing 18 of the pumps. We apologise to the residents who had to witness animals dying.”
