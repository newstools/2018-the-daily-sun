THIRTY-ONE people were injured in two separate accidents on Friday. Twenty people were injured when a taxi overturned on William Nicol Drive in Bryanston, northern Joburg. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said: “Several people were scattered all over the scene, while one was trapped inside the vehicle. “Rescue services personnel had to use specialised equipment to free the passenger.” Meiring said three people sustained critical injuries. “Paramedics treated the patients and provided the critically injured with advanced life support interventions. The injured were taken to nearby hospitals for urgent treatment,” he said. Meiring said paramedics were called to the scene at about 4pm. “Paramedics found that 18 children were in the vehicle when the incident occurred,” said Meiring. He said 10 kids sustained minor to moderate injuries, but no deaths were reported. Meanwhile, KZN Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda ordered an investigation into the murder of 11 taximen. The men were ambushed on the R74 between Colenso and Weenen on Saturday. Kaunda said: “We told the police to work around the clock to ensure the culprits are caught and face the full might of the law. “There are strong indications that this incident is related to taxi violence in Gauteng.”
