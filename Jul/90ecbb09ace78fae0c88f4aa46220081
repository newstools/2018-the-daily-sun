THE family and friends of Xolisile Ndzongana are struggling to come to terms with his death. The 27-year-old from Mhluzi in Middleburg, Mpumalanga, was a victim of road rage. A group of men allegedly beat him to a pulp on Sunday at about 4am when Xolisile and his friends were driving home. Xolisile had asked the men to make way for their car to pass as they had blocked the road. Xolisile’s friend, Lawrence Nelumoni (35), said when they asked the men if they could pass, all hell broke loose. “They became aggressive and started calling us the k and f words, while pouring beer on us.” Lawrence said the men then beat up Xolisile. “We called an ambulance and went to the police station to open a case of assault.” Xolisile was admitted to hospital but died on Monday. His heartbroken mum, Lulama Ntika (56), said she thought her son would meet his death when he moved to Mpumalanga from the Eastern Cape in 2014. “He was my last born and had big dreams.” Xolisile’s colleague, Bongani Majola (29), said he will miss Xolisile’s lively personality. Police spokeswoman Captain Khanyisile Zwane said a case of assault was opened, which will now change to murder. She said no arrests have been made.
