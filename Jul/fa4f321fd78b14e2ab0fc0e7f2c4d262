THESE women are doing it for their kids. Members of Madiba Cultural Group from Qunu, Eastern Cape often perform at local events to make money for their children. The four-member group was formed in 1998 and it is still going strong. Nolandile Geledwane (61), founder and chairwoman of the group, said dancing has helped them put food on their tables. “We only take 5% of the money we make and save the rest in the bank. “The aim is to have enough money so that we can send our kids to university,” said Nolandile. “Performing is also good for our health and it keeps us fit. “We only rehearse twice a week. “We specialise in ibuyambo dance because it’s part of our culture. “We also teach young people in the village this type of dance.” The group has performed at many local events around the OR Tambo region. “We have also performed for the late Nelson Mandela in Qunu,” Nolandile told the People’s Paper. “It would have been nice to perform at Tata’s 100th birthday celebration to show that we are still doing what he held dear in his heart. “But as most of us are married to the Madiba clan, it wouldn’t be possible. “Traditionally, wives are expected to perform other duties during ceremonies. “But our children will perform on the day.”
