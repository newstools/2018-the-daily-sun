WITH less than two weeks to go before the start of the new Absa Premiership season, the 32-year-old Khethokwakhe Masuku is not losing any sleep over his future, despite being forced to play in friendly matches. The former Orlando Pirates midfielder remains optimistic that he will get to play in the PSL again, considering his match fitness and creativity in winning matches for his club. But he knows time is running out for him with the transfer window set to shut next month. Masuku was key in helping Soweto Super United pocket R175 000 in prize money when they beat beat Mighty Birds FC 1-0 to lift the annual Maimane Alfred Phiri (MAP) Games trophy at Alexandra Stadium on Sunday. Sabo Manikela scored the only goal to break the hearts of the KwaZulu-Natal-based Mighty Birds. Said Masuku: “Playing in the MAP Games helped me regain my match fitness and I am ready for the PSL.” He attributed United’s success to the motivation from his club chairman Mandla Mdakane throughout the tournament. Masuku is also positive that his teammate Manikela’s performance will have caught the eye of PSL club bosses and scouts. “I would be equally happy to see one or two of these youngsters get PSL contracts too,” Masuku said. “Their motive was to push until the final because they knew winning the competition could benefit them. “They knew what was at stake with the scouts there. I hope they get the chance to showcase their talent in the National First Division or PSL. It can happen.” Meanwhile, Mighty Birds coach Xolani Khumalo says they will come back stronger next season as they have learned from mistakes they committed. The players will all get a portion of the R95 000 second prize to help provide for their families, as many of the players play in the lower divisions such as the SAB League where there are no financial benefits. Former Bafana Bafana midfielder Maimane Phiri says the support they received during the tournament was incredible, as the game was also televised live on TV.
