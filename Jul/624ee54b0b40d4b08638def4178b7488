SABELO Phiri’s life has become a living hell. The 28-year-old Malawian has spent the past three months living on the streets of Tshwane and desperately searching for his mum’s family. Sabelo told Daily Sun his mum Thabitha Phiri died when he was six. His dad Abdul Twalibu filled the gap and did everything for him, but his life started falling apart in 2007 when he died. “My father did everything for me. I never lacked anything,” he said. “But shortly after he died his relatives came and took everything.” He was forced to drop out of school as there was no one to pay his fees. After he struggled for years, his father’s friend advised him to go look for his mum’s relatives in South Africa. “My mum died when I was still a kid. Even the pictures we had of her got lost,” he said. “When I asked my dad about her, he’d only tell me they met and got married in KZN. After I was born they moved to Malawi.” Sabelo said finding his family was his only hope for survival. “When I arrived in South Africa in April, thugs stole my bags and the little cash I had on me. “I ended up on the streets. I thought it wouldn’t be for long if I found what I was looking for.” He hopes SunReaders will help him find his relatives in Mzansi.
