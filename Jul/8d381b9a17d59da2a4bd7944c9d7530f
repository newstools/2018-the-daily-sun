FOOTAGE of a wonder dog performing CPR on a cop
pretending to be dead has set Twitter alight with oohs and aahs. The clip of Poncho the dog rescuing his “fallen” comrade
was posted by the Madrid cops in Spain last Friday. The caption to the Twitter post reads:
'"Heroic" performance of our #4pawedcompanion Poncho, who did not
hesitate for a moment to "save the life" of the agent, practicing the
#CPR in a masterful way. '"The dog is the only being in the world that will
love you more than he loves himself" - John Billings.'
