Going to a make up store to buy make up is actually fun but not as easy if you do not know your skin type. Knowing your skin type is important because you will know what products to use and how to use them to avoid spending too much on unnecessary products sometimes. Here is how you can discover what skin type you have. Cleanse your face and don’t apply any further products after. Check out how your skin looks and feels about an hour later, then compare your skin’s feel and appearance to these common signs that can help you figure out whether you have oily, dry, combination, or “normal” skin. Oily Skin Looks too shiny with large pores, especially around your T-zone area (your forehead, nose, and chin). Oily skin will experience more black heads and blemishes and oily hair is also a way of telling if you have this type of skin. Combination Skin This is the most common skin type and usually with medium sized pores and a little oily or dry here and there. The rest of the skin might be smoother and noticeably dry and black heads around the nose area or the forehead and hairline area. Dry Skin Dry skin will appear scaly and flaky it feels tight after cleansing and very dry to the touch. People with dry skin often have red patches on their skin and normally dry hands and feet. Normal Skin The word “normal” is kind of a misnomer because having oily or dry skin doesn’t mean you’re not normal! In the parlance of skincare, “normal” skin just means you don’t have any recurring, stand-out issues. “Your skin can be classified as normal if it isn’t particularly oily or dry and if anti-aging, acne, and sensitivity aren’t concerns on your radar—in other words, the skin type all of us wish we had,” says Dakar and that is according to Healthyway. Sensitive skin This skin type is often with red patches and irritated. The skin tends to be delicate with fine pores. Using harsh product leads to rash or irritated skin.
