MEMBERS of the KwaZulu-Natal United Nurses Forum have called for the axing of Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo. They accuse him of presiding over the collapse of the healthcare system. The nurses brought the Pietermaritzburg CBD traffic to a standstill when they marched to the KZN Legislature on Monday, demanding that speaker Lydia Johnson intervene in the matter. The angry nurses accused the department of forcing nurses to work overtime without pay, failing to hire more staff which impacts on the quality of service, and for hiring nurses from other provinces. Forum organiser Bhekithemba Gumbi said Dhlomo had failed to provide quality healthcare to the province’s citizens. He questioned why so many department heads had left since Dhlomo became MEC and stressed that Premier Willies Mchunu should remove him. He said nurses were overworked and were becoming the target of angry residents. “We have had instances where our nurses have been attacked by the residents because they are forced to do work that is not part of their job description. This is enough,” said Gumbi. Legislature official Zethembiso Nzuza accepted the memorandum and promised to deliver it to the speaker’s office. Health department spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said the department believed in using appropriate platforms to engage with employees. She said they were in contact with unions that represent workers in the department.
