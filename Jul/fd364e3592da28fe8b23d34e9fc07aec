The 80s style windbreaker is resurfing. This is a trend that comes and goes but it's back, and this time, ladies are hopping on board. A windbreaker is a jacket with a thin fabric from synthetic material designed to resist from wind. It traditionally has a zip and worn during harsh temperatures of cold weather and rainy weather. Back in the 80s, people wore windbreaker tracksuits and this trend seems to be back. The windbreaker that is on trend now, is the colourful, neon colour types.
