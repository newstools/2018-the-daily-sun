BLACK Leopards are not back in the Absa Premiership to make up the numbers but to challenge for trophies. This is the promise made by Lidoda Duvha head coach and former goalkeeper Joel Masutha. Masutha spoke to SunSport yesterday as Leopards took part in the inaugural one-day Limpopo Soccer Legacy Spectacular at Giyani Stadium. “I am pleased with the squad we have assembled and the commitment players showed in pre-season training and friendlies,” he said. “We all made the promise that this time Leopards are in the PSL to stay and fight for trophies. That thing of staying for one or two seasons and getting relegated is history. With the squad we have I am optimistic that we will make our fans proud.” He revealed that he has a good working relationship with new technical director Stephane Henri Cusin, who many believe was hired by Leopards chairman David Thidiela to take over his job. Masutha guided the team back to top flight football after they spent five seasons in the National First Division. “Stephane is a good guy and knowledgeable about football,” said Masutha. “I am still young and open-minded. I believe I will learn a lot from him. We are working very nicely together. He is a professional and we understand each other. I believe with his know­ledge we can achieve a lot at Leopards.” He said they might add two or three players before the transfer deadline at the end of August. “I think we might make additions but will not sign someone just for the sake of it. We have a strong squad and will see when the league starts where we need to add.” Leopards open their 2018-19 season with a Limpopo derby against Baroka FC at Thohoyandou Stadium on 4 August.
