THE Brazil, Russia,
India, China and South Africa (BRICS) Summit has officially been launched on
Wednesday morning. Captains of industry, heads of
state-owned entities and government leaders will discuss strategic economic
matters affecting the future of BRICS. The government leaders attending the summit include, China's
President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Michel Temer. On Tuesday, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa held bilateral
talks with President Xi Jinping, which resulted in China committing to invest
over R14.7 billion in Mzansi. Jinping said China looks forward to working with South Africa to
build on the momentum of the 20th anniversary of diplomatic ties. In his opening speech, minister of Trade and Industry Rob Davies
said this year’s theme, ‘BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth
and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution’, will deliberate on the
current global political economy and its implications for BRICS member
countries. “The implications of the 4th Industrial Revolution on inclusive
growth and transformation, facilitating intra-BRICS trade, as well as fostering
BRIC-Africa partnerships will also be discussed,” said Davies ahead of the
Summit. “The Business Forum is also important because it will create
opportunities for partnerships between African and BRICS companies as well as
develop concrete measures to address the deficiencies within productive sectors
impeding the optimal development of the continent,” said Davies.
