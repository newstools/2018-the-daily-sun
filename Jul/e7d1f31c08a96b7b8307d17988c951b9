PARENTS are demanding the removal of an acting principal who is an alleged casanova. Parents locked out teachers and pupils at Okumhlophe High School, south of Durban yesterday morning. They refused to let them in until the department of basic education appointed a new principal. Cops were called and cut the lock to allow pupils and teachers in. KZN Education portfolio committee members, led by chairwoman Linda Hlongwa and officials from the Umlazi district, visited the school to calm the parents and promised to investigate the allegations. Parents alleged that acting principal Hlanganani Zwane discusses sexual matters with female pupils on a WhatsApp group he created, and that he dates schoolgirls. Parents also said teachers charged R100 per child for extra classes on weekends. School governing body chairwoman Queen Mkhonde said Zwane was not suitable to run the school and must go. She asked why the principal who was recommended by the SGB was not appointed. Acting Umlazi education director, Ntokozo Cele promised to investigate the allegations. Zwane said he didnâ€™t want to comment on the accusation of sexual matters being discussed with pupils. And he said it was not true that teachers charged pupils for weekend classes.
