THREE men and a woman will appear in the Secunda Magistrates Court on Monday for kidnapping, murder and attempted murder. The four suspects, aged between 34 and 46, allegedly kidnapped a 20-year-old pregnant woman and carried out a forced termination of pregnancy. According to police spokesman Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe, the victim was kidnapped by the three men and the woman, who is her aunt. Bhembe said the victim was taken to Ogies where she was locked in a room and her baby was removed. The foetus was wrapped in a plastic bag and thrown on a railway line. The young woman managed to unlock the door and escaped. On her way she asked for a lift to Secunda where she reported the matter to the police. The four appeared briefly in court on Monday and their case was postponed to 30 July for a formal bail application and further investigation.
