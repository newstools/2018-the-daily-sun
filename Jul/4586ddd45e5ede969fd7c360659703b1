Kwaito star Mampintsha says he is praying for Masechaba Ndlovu after she announced her split from her estranged husband Vusi. READ: MASECHABA SPLITS FROM HUSBAND! It is no secret that there is no love lost between the two after Masechaba had a hand in bringing to light allegations that Mampintsha was abusing his then fiancé Babes Wodumo. They got involved in a heated debate on Metro FM when the station gave Mampintsha his right of reply. The Drive host felt a frustrated Mampintsha was trying to avoid important questions and the interview ended on a sour note. And so, when Masechaba announced her split from her husband on Wednesday on Instagram, Mampintsha was one of the first people to comment. Mampintsha, real name Mandla Maphumulo, was quick to remind Mashechaba about the “tricky” nature of relationships. “Yabonake amaRelationship anjani sis wam Masechaba Ndlovu (Do you see how relationships are my sister). Like I said to you before, relationships are very tricky, kodwake nawe sizokuthandazela (but then we will pray for you too). Njengoba nathi sisasemthandazweni namanje. (As we are in prayers ourselves right now)  God bless you,” Mampintsha said.
