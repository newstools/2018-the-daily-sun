IN 2014, Dael Tabe’s wife just fell down and died in their shack. After that, Dael (53) from Sekgopi Square in Mangaung, told his family when he died he wanted to be buried with his wife. On Monday afternoon, residents were shocked when he died exactly the same way as his wife. He was walking on the street when he fell down and died. His family believes Dael saw his death coming because he avoided making eye contact with anyone before his death. His sister-in-law, Paulina Mothupi (52), said Dael had been living alone since the death of his wife. “His wife just fell over dead in their shack,” said Paulina. She said Dael had just left the house of his neighbour, Pulane Matete (46), and was on his way to visit an umqombothi seller when the incident happened. Pulane told Daily Sun: “What surprised me most was that he avoided making eye contact when we were talking. “He told me he wanted to be buried with his wife when he died. “My neighbour saw his death coming before he left my house.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi, said an inquest docket has been opened.
