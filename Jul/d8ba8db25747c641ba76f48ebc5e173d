FAMILY planning is a responsibility that is often left to women. However, men who attended the KZN Health Department’s interfaith discussion and screening forum were told to play their part. The event was held at Reunion Community Hall in Umlazi, south of Durban on Saturday. The men who attended the event were also encouraged to take a stand against women and child abuse. Reverend Sigungu Shangase said the initiative was aimed at men of faith. “This month we are targeting men in churches, mosques and other religious temples.” Shangase encouraged men to support their partners. He said men needed to start accompanying their pregnant wives or girlfriends to antenatal clinics. “It is also important for men to get into the habit of eating well and exercising regularly. “They must make use of health facilities and take the medication prescribed to them.” Lungile Khizwayo (35), a woman who attended the event, said the discussions the men had would help take the load off their partners. “Once men start taking responsibility for the number of children they want, they can tell their partners to use contraceptives. “This will be something they discuss together. “Going with their partners to clinics will also give men a chance to learn how to treat pregnant women,” she said. Lungile said women are pleased by the fact that men are having this discussion because it will make a huge difference to their relationships.
