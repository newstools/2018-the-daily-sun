NEITHER the cold winter chill nor the choking dust will keep fans away from the Maimane Alfred Phiri (MAP) Games this weekend. In their hundreds, local fans will pack the grassy western side of the Rotary Sport Grounds in Alexandra to witness the breathtaking action-packed Last 16 round match-ups. Temperatures are set to drop as a cold front affecting most parts of the country this week extends to the weekend. But that is no cause for concern for the fans, who wouldn’t miss the MAP Games even for the Fifa World Cup currently underway in Russia. Throughout the tournament, they clap, whistle and cheer as the likes of Tlou Segolela jostle for the ball on the dry pitch, marvelling at the “kasi flavour” football. They find ways to stick it out for the entire event, without the luxury of suites, in the biting cold. “It is a culture. These games are have since become part of our kasi like any other major event,” said Stanley Makhubela, who is part of the organising team. “We see a sharp increase in the number of fans every year and it’s no different this year. The football is exciting and that is reflected in the attendance figures. Teams travel from as far as KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo. Many professionals started their careers at these games. And we are happy to contribute to the development of football in the country.” The battle for the R175 000 prize continues with four matches tomorrow and another four on Sunday. Skomboys and ComeBoys kick off proceedings while United FC are up against Chego. JT Black Stars take on Moretele All Stars, while Tshepo Matsemela-inspired La Macia tackle and The Rock. On Sunday, Segolela will lead Dalmany Young Chiefs against Newcastle Homeboys while Grandiose tussle with Juventus. But many eyes will be on the mouth-watering clash between Mamba XI and Soweto Super United.
