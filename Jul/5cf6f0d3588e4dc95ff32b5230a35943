THE body of the man who mysteriously disappeared two weeks ago in the middle of a dam in Thokoza, Ekurhuleni was found yesterday. Police divers have been searching the dam since fishermen saw him swimming to the middle and disappearing beneath the water. The body of Yamkela Mgoqi (21) was found there. His uncle Mzwandile Booi (42) told Daily Sun his nephew had been missing for two weeks. He said Yamkela left to buy cigarettes. A slip that was found in the hat he wore before swimming into the dam showed this. Daily Sun reported the missing man swam to the centre of the dam, singing ancestral songs before drowning. “He was a first year engineering student at Vaal University of Technology and lived with his mum. She called our family to inform us he /had been missing for two weeks.” Mzwandile suspected Yamkela had a calling because of the way he behaved. “He was very strict, reserved, never dated and kept to himself but enjoyed the company of children. “My dead aunt was a sangoma but after her, no one entertained the ancestors. “Most of our family attend charismatic churches.” Mzwandile believes there is definitely something drawing people into the dam. He said Yamkela held his fists up as if he had been fighting something or someone. Mzwandile said he told Yamkela’s mum, who has not been well since her son went missing, of the discovery. He said the body would be taken to Eastern Cape for burial but they hadn’t yet made funeral arrangements as they need help with funds. Cop spokeswoman Buyisile Mvelase said the body of a reported missing person was found in Thokoza Dam. “Police divers had been looking for the body in the dam and we confirm it belongs to Yamkela Mgoqi. “His family came forward to identify him,” Mvelase said.
