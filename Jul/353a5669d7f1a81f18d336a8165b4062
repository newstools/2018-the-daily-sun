GLADYS Shilenge and her son Andrew (25) have made peace. The 54-year-old mum from Mabopane, Tshwane, has been looking over her shoulder for the past eight years, but that changed. The People’s Paper published Gladys’ story on 6 December, headlined, “Addict son tried to stab me!” The mum said she was afraid of her drug addict son. Gladys said her life was a living hell because Andrew not only beat her but also tried to stab her with a knife. The attacks had allegedly been happening since 2009, but Gladys and Andrew have resolved their differences. Andrew said after suffering from panic attacks a few months ago, he decided to talk to his mum. “I knew my mum would be there for me,” he said. “I regret everything I did to her. But I’m prepared to show my mum love and respect.” Gladys said: “Andrew was admitted to Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital, where he’s getting professional help.”
