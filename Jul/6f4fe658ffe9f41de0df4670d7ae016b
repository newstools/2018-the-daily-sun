 A large group of protestors blocked the N1 South at the
Samrand off-ramp on Monday morning. The highway was heavily affected as the Johannesburg Metro
Police Department (JMPD) advised motorists to use alternative routes. JMPD Spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said officers have
managed to move the protesters, but traffic was still badly affected. According to Talk Radio 702, the community is complaining
about the roads. The community allegedly wants speed humps and traffic lights
to be installed, which is what led to the protests.
