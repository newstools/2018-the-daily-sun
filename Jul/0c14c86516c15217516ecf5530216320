Free State Stars captain Paulos Masehe believes striker Siphelele “Shaka Zulu” Mthembu will prove to be a big loss for Ealla Koto this season. The 30 year-old joined Cape Town City on a one year deal with an option to extend and his new coach, Benni McCarthy is backing him to double his goal tally and get into double figures. Mthembu’s five goals last season might not sound too impressive, but Masehe says the striker will be missed for all the other attributes he brought into the team. “Replacing him is going to be difficult because he had started to improve and understand how we wanted him to play,” Masehe said. “He was getting better by each game and he was giving us what most strikers are failing to give, which is hard work, hustling and holding the ball to bring other players into play,” he added. Masehe does, however, believe that the Bethlehem based side will find another goal poacher who will offer something different but equally effective. “No one is irreplaceable, I’m sure there is someone out there who would help improve this team.” Free State Stars had one of their best seasons last term, finishing sixth on the log and helping themselves to the Nedbank Cup, and a spot in the 2019 CAF Confederations Cup. Masehe says last seasons’ achievements will only serve as motivation for more success, but insists that they will take each game as it comes. “We don’t want to look too far ahead and put unnecessary pressure on ourselves, but the opportunity we have right now with the MTN 8 is one that we should grab with both hands.”
