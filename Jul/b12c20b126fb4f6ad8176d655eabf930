JULIA Masisi said candles calm her down when she’s stressed. Her love of candles has led to the 63-year-old from Moroka North in Soweto becoming a candlemaker. “Candle matter a lot. “People connect with the scent and light of candles during meditation or times of relaxation.” Julia said her love of candles started when she started recycling. “I would melt them down to make new candles. During load shedding, they came in handy.” She never suspected she would one day run a candle factory shop but today, she and three partners own Joy Candle Light. “We took over an existing candle business owned by Edward May. Before his death, he trained us for six months. “It was as if he knew he was leaving us a way to empower ourselves with his knowledge . He was very creative.” Julia, who has been running the business for two years, said she makes products for all occasions. “Our clients include the Methodist Church and NGOs helping with Aids and cancer awareness campaigns. “We also do a lot of school projects, corporate functions and weddings. The customer tells us their theme and we do the rest,” she said. Julia said to make candles, properly, you need to know how to speak to them. “Candles are moody sometimes, especially when you use the wrong colours or scents. “They will melt if they have a weak shape and the string will come out,” she said. Julia, who also is a preacher at church, said it takes two to three hours to make a small candle and up to a day for a larger one.
