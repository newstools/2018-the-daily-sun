COPS had their hands full yesterday trying to disperse an unruly crowd in Mzimhlophe, Soweto. An angry crowd barricaded the busy Rev Modise Road with burning tyres, rocks and rubbish. They were protesting over electricity. Residents told Daily Sun they had been without power for two weeks. “We have tried all possible ways to get the electricity restored, but we have failed. We have now resorted to a protest,” said Sizwe Mazibuko. He said no one was willing to listen to the residents’ complaints. “We are now forcing them to listen. They will get our message, whether they like it or not. We want our electricity back,” said Sizwe. Residents said life without electricity is very difficult. Busiswa Njoko (36), said: “We have elderly people who cannot cope with the cold. We have kids who have to bathe with cold water in the morning before going to school. “We are sick and tired.” Cops had to use rubber bullets to disperse the crowd of protesters. Police officers later cleared the road. Meadowlands police spokesman Captain Thinandaba Lefhugu said the police were monitoring the area. Eskom spokeswoman Tumi Moloi confirmed that electricity had indeed been cut off in Mzimhlophe. “When a complaint is lodged, we first check if the person lodging it is a paying customer. “If the customer is not paying, we might not attend to them quickly because we prioritise paying customers, which is the issue in Mzimhlophe. “A non-paying customer lodged a complaint two weeks ago. We did not prioritise that call because he is not paying for our services,” she said. Moloi said a paying customer from the same area lodged a complaint yesterday and technicians quickly assessed the matter so that electricity could be restored as soon as possible.
