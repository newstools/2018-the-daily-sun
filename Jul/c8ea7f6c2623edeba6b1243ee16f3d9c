THREE men were bust with a slaughtered cow on Friday. The men, aged between 31 and 39, were driving in a Mazda 323 when they were arrested by cops near Glebelands Hostel, Umlazi. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala, said cops were patrolling near the hostel when they saw the car driving slowly as if it was carrying a heavy load. “When police pulled the vehicle over, two men were in the front and the man in the back was sitting on top of a slaughtered cow,” Gwala told Daily Sun. “The cow had been cut into pieces. “Its head, legs and body parts were all over the back seat, while its intestines were hanging out of the boot of the small car.” Gwala said cops discovered that the animal was stolen in Ixopo on Thursday night. The men were charged for stock theft and the possession of stolen property. She told the People’s Paper the suspects were expected to appear in the Umlazi Magistrates Court on Monday. A police source said the men had confessed that they had planned to braai the meat at their home in Umlazi.
