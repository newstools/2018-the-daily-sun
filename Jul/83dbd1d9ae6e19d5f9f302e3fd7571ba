UTTER shock hit Mazhar Hassen twice! The 34-year-old dad was hijacked at gunpoint on Saturday afternoon. But worse was to come. The evil thugs grabbed Mazhar’s two-year-old son and threw him out of the car like a doll. The hijackers drove off with Mazhar’s white VW Polo Classic with the registration number FVD 694 FS. Luckily the child was not harmed. Cops are now hunting for the two suspects following the incident in Saaiplaas, Virginia. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane said the vehicle was hijacked at about 2pm. “The victim had gone to visit his parents and fetch his two-year-old son when he was approached by two unknown men. “While he was buckling his son into the back seat, they allegedly pointed a gun at him and threw his son out of the car before driving off,” said Mokhuoane. Inside the car were Mazhar’s personal belongings, including his wallet containing bank cards, his driver’s licence and cash. Mokhuoane said the boy was checked and did not sustain any injuries. The police urged anyone with information regarding the suspects to contact Detective-Warrant Officer Lesole Monye on 082 084 2401 or contact the nearest cop shop.
