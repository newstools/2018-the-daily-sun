SHE was asked to look after their father who was confined to a wheelchair. But she allegedly married the 85-year-old man in secret. And now she’s in charge and kicking everyone out of the family home after the madala’s death. Brian Makhabela (44) of White City in Soweto said they only found out about the marriage after their father, Robert Makhabela, died on Thursday. He said five years ago, their aunt asked the woman to move in with them and help with his father, who had suffered a stroke. “The house belonged to my aunt. My father had moved in with her because he was ill. When my aunt died a year later, my father was left in the house with the helper.” Brian said things started to become suspicious early this year. “Whenever I visited my father, the woman wouldn’t give me a moment of privacy with him. When his death certificate was issued, we found out they got married in March. Since then, she doesn’t want us to visit.” But the woman, Ruth Makhabela, said Brian has always had a problem with her. “He is bitter. I don’t know what he wants from me. I didn’t marry his father in secret,” said Ruth, adding that they were once in a relationship in the 1980s. “I never kicked anyone out of the house, although the house is now mine. His aunt gave me the house before she died. She said she feared that her daughter would sell it when she died,” said Ruth. Both the aunt and the daughter have subsequently died.
