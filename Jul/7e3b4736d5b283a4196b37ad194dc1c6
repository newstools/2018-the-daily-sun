A video footage showing a cop and a civilian involved in
a fist fight has surfaced on social media. Two officers from the Gauteng Traffic Police had stopped an
alleged drunk motorist on the N12 West bound. The motorists then tried to evade arrest
by running away from the cops towards Eldorado Park. A chase ensued and the motorist was caught. During the process of arresting the motorist, a member of
the community charged towards one of the officers and assaulted him. But the fit cop fought back and ended beating up the man. He was also arrested and charged with interference as
well as assaulting a law enforcement officer. The Gauteng Department of Community Safety said it has
noted with concern a video clip doing rounds on social media of an incident in
which an officer from the Gauteng Traffic Police was assaulted by a member of
the community in the South of Joburg last week on Friday. "The importance of a good relationship between the
law enforcement agencies and communities in combating crime cannot be
over-emphasized. "The law enforcement officers depend on community
members to develop safety solutions to crime and it is with extreme
disappointmentÂ  to notice members of the
communities behaving in such a manner. "The barbaric act displayed by the community member
leaves much to be desired and should be condemned in the strongest possible
terms," said Ofentse Morwane from Gauteng Department of Community Safety . Morwane said: "officers will continue to execute
their responsibility to protect the citizens of this province and do so
irrespective of any hindrance or obstruction from any member of the community. "
