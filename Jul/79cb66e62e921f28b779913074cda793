THEY claim their older sister from Meadowlands, Soweto, is tormenting them. One of the Morwane siblings Lebogang (38) told Daily Sun her sister Mpho (54) kicked them out of their dad’s house. “Mpho is harassing us because our dad is no longer alive,” she claimed. She said their dad died in 1980 and Mpho didn’t want them to live in the family home. “All four of us have the same biological father, but she claims we’re not our father’s children,” she said. “I told her we must all do DNA tests to prove or disprove her theory, but she refused. “This woman has her own house in Vosloorus. She left her husband and came here to make our lives miserable.” Nhlanhla Morwane (38), who’s married to Mpho’s brother Shimane, said Mpho stopped talking to her after she failed to lend her money. “She owed a mashonisa money and I didn’t have money on that day,” said Nhlanhla. “She even got a restraining order against my man and gets him arrested every chance she gets.” She claimed Shimane was the one who extended the family home and built outside rooms with money he got from the Road Accident Fund. “Today Shimane is treated like rubbish because the money is gone, and she wants him out,” she said. “As we speak, the police arrested him this morning for breaking a roller door which he bought with his own money.” Shimane (41) said: “My spaza shop doesn’t have customers because they don’t feel welcome. “It’s really bad. I think selling this house would be a better option.” When Daily Sun contacted Mpho, she said: “I dont know you, you don’t know me. “As long as you’re going to talk about that thing, don’t ever call me.” She said she was not fighting with anyone.
