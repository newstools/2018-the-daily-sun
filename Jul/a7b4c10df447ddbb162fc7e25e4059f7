MPL JANE Cowley said this week the health crisis in the province was a human rights violation. She said there was a shortage of ambulances, and patients who lived far from hospitals struggled to get medication. “The current fleet consists of just over 400 ambulances, and there are no plans to enlarge it.” She said half the of ambulances were undergoing repairs or had been written off. “In some rural areas, where there are no ambulances, it can cost up to R800 to get to the nearest clinic or hospital.” She said patients were dying and women were giving birth on roadsides. “While some have to wait for ambulances, others use wheelbarrows to transport sick family members.” After noticing there was a problem, the Cookhouse Wind Farm donated a mobile clinic to the people of Bedford and Adelaide. Operations manager Elton Gordon said the mobile clinic had about five healthcare workers. Health spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha said: “The MEC has not violated any human rights. The department has registered replacement vehicles for old and non-operational vehicles.” The staff shortage issue was being attended to.
