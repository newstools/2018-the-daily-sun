Therapists in the US said more and more patients are
suffering from Trump Anxiety Disorder. The unofficial disorder is when patients fear the future
of the country because of Trump's Twitter feuds and policies. Therapists say there's been a rise in anxiety stemming
from the country's politics, and it is being called "Trump Anxiety
Disorder." FOX NEWS said that a report from CBC News in Canada says
that since President Trump was elected, mental health professionals in the
United States have seen an increase in patients whose stress has come from
politics. A prevalent "symptom" of the
"disorder" is feeling as though the world is going to end. Sen. Cory Booker Pleads for Supporters to 'Get Up in the
Face of Congresspeople' Elisabeth LaMotte, founder of the D.C. Counseling and
Psychotherapy Center in Washington, D.C., said that some of her patients feel
"on edge" about Trump's decisions. "It's very disorienting and constantly
unsettling," LaMotte said. LaMotte told CBC News, too, that even those who support
the president feel isolated within social spaces or their families. According to an essay written by psychologist Jennifer
Panning, the symptoms of "Trump Anxiety Disorder" include
"feeling a loss of control and helplessness, and fretting about what's
happening in the country and spending excessive time on social media." A 2017 poll by the American Psychological Organization
also found that nearly half of its respondents said they were significantly
stressed due to the country's political climate.
