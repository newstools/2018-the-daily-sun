SOME organisations are against the idea of renaming Grahamstown Makhanda. Makhanda was a Xhosa warrior, philosopher and prophet who led an attack against the British in 1819. The proposed change was published in the Government Gazette on Friday, but some residents want the name to stay the same. Advocate Jock McConnachie, a campaigner against the name change, said: “Friday’s notice in the Government Gazette was flawed because it gives the impression that the name change is final. “The minister is required by law to consider all objections before making a decision. “He must also provide reasons for accepting or rejecting the objections.” Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa said: “For almost 20 years there has been a call to do away with names associated with colonialism. “We received more than 2 000 objections to the renaming of Grahamstown. “The South African Geographical Names Council confirmed that the objections will be dealt with in accordance with the law. “Until then, the name Grahamstown remains.” Arts and Culture spokeswoman Asanda Magaqa said: “The department is aware of organisations in Grahamstown that are objecting to the renaming. “It is their legal right to do so. We will respond to objections after the gazette has been published for more than 30 days. We don’t do anything without public participation.”
