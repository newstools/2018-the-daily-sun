SASSA boss Abraham Mahlangu spent time with elderly people in Gugulethu on Mandela Day on Wednesday. His visit wasn’t only to celebrate the special day but also to explain to them the difficulties faced when changing cards from the previous service provider to the post office. “We are here because we heard that some of you had problems and we wanted to apologise. “When we changed the cards, there were problems and some people couldn’t get their money but we want them to know it is safe.” He said the elders don’t have to take all their money at once but that whenever it was needed, it would be there. He also gave them tips on how to avoid long queues. “You don’t have to go there on the first day of the month. You can go after that to avoid long queues and your money will be there. “No one will touch it.” He said the new cards cannot be used for illegal deductions and that people needed to change to the new system before the end of September. “Make sure that by then you have changed to the new cards. Now no one will ever lose their money because of illegal deductions.” Mahlangu also said those in other provinces can change to the new cards wherever they are. “No one will have to go back to Eastern Cape or other provinces but can change them here. “Our officials can visit those who can’t walk.” Mavis Ngumbela (73) was pleased. “Some of us really struggled to get these cards and are afraid because people said they lost their money.”
