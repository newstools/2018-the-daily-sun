THE LIVES of poor Matsila villagers outside Vuwani have been changed for the better. The Matsila Community Development Trust has created 80 new job opportunities. The trust has created over 500 employment opportunities for locals through development projects. The Matsila Vegetable Farming Co-operative has 80 hectares of land available for crop farming, creating new permanent employment opportunities for locals and people from neighbouring villages. It will also create 200 seasonal jobs. This weekend, the co-operative received a new tractor valued at over R600 000 from the department of rural development and land reform. It will beef up the existing fleet of three tractors in preparation for the planting season. Chief Livhuwani Matsila said the tractor will come in handy as they prepare for production during the planting season. “There is big demand for cash crops in the outside market, as well as for local consumption. “We would not have coped with our fleet and are grateful the department has bailed us out. “This much needed tractor will improve many lives in our village in terms of job creation and will help residents, as they can use it for ploughing their plots with competitive diesel and maintenance prices. “Our long term goal is to see all our people working and able to feed their families,” the chief said.
