Constitution Hill, together with its partners, commemorates the youth of ’76, through a celebration of creative expression at its Annual Basha Uhuru Freedom Fest. The three day festival kicked off on a high note on 28 June and ended on 30 June. Wrapping up ‘youth month’ on a positive note with inspiring young people. The event was fun-filled with music, film, art, poetry, design and fashion – all within the Constitution Hill human rights precinct located within Joburg’s inner city. For three days, the precinct is turned into a creative playground for inspiring, out-of-the-box collaborations and incredible creative showcases. Performances included Moonchild Sanelly, K.O, Pro Kid, DJ Speedsta, Big Zulu, Urban Village, Sho Madjozi, Vuzu Hustle’s Joshua I AM, Black Motion, and the legendary Skwatta Kamp! Just to name a few. The festival was established in 2013 and has become Constitution Hill’s flagship arts festival. Now in its 6th year, it is well established as one of Johannesburg’s most popular contemporary youth events. The Constitution Hill Human Rights Precinct was once a brutal prison where the youth of ’76 were themselves incarcerated, now it is home to the Constitutional Court - a beacon of hope for the nation. The Precinct symbolically represents our country’s journey from a dark, painful past to a present and future that is filled with hope. Check out the images here:
