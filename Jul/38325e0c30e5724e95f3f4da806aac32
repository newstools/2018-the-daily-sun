A video of a new method used to steal people’s belongings inside
their cars is doing the rounds on social media. In the CCTV footage, the thug can be seen opening the left
back door of an unaware woman’s AUDI Q5, just before she central locks the car. As the back door was opened and the woman was unaware, she
thinks the car is locked but in actual fact it is not locked. After the woman has left, the tsotso comes back to the car
acting as though he on the phone. He then opens the door that he tempered with and steals the
woman’s bag. The incident allegedly took place outside Westerford
Kwikspar in Campground road Rondebosch. It is not clear when the incident happened exactly.
