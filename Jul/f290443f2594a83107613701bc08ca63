East Coast Radio’s drive time host, Bongani Mtolo has done a complete 180 in a matter of four days. Last week Friday, the station announced that Bongani has resigned from the station and that fans would no longer be hearing the presenter on air. A statement from the station claimed that Bongani had left the station to pursue other opportunities. While the country awaited the announcement of his replacement, East Coast Radio has instead announced that Bongani has now changed his mind about leaving the station. Not only is he no longer leaving, but he has now singed on to stay a further two years with the station. “Bongani has decided to retract his resignation and has, subsequently, signed a two year contract with the station,” the station said in a statement. Bongani was also quoted in the statement as saying: “After much consideration regarding my resignation from East Coast Radio and weighing up the other opportunities available to me, I decided that it was not the right time for me to leave the station.” Bongani won the Best Afternoon Drive Show presenter at Liberty Radio Awards in 2016.
