NTOMBOSINDISO Thuthani (36) believes her son was murdered after he tried to leave a gang. “Yamkela was only 17, and even though he used to smoke dagga, petrol and tik, he wasn’t doing that anymore,” she said. “He quit gang life. He was just trying to do the right thing, not knowing he’d lose his life.” Ntombosindiso, from Marikana squatter camp in Cape Town, lost her son at the end of last month. She told Daily Sun she was worried the people who killed Yamkela were now after her. “I’m hurt that they killed my son and I don’t feel safe anymore,” said Ntombosindiso. “On the last Thursday of June, I was told to go to the graveyard where my son’s dead body was dumped.” She found his body next to a grave, covered with leaves. “Government needs to do something,” she said. Ntombosindiso, who’s unemployed, can’t afford to travel to the Eastern Cape to bury her son next week. “I need all the help I can get. I’m hoping, now that Daily Sun has visited me, that I’ll get help,” she said. Pastor Ntombekhaya Plati said Yamkela was a humble kid and was willing to change his ways. Yamkela had recently joined Plati’s organisation, which helps drug addicts and abused women. Cops are investigating a murder case. “Government needs to intervene now,” said Plati. “It looks as if we’re going back to a time when 11 people were killed in just one day last year.” Western Cape police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “The body of a 17-year-old was found by police on Disa Road, Klipfontein. “One died of gunshot wounds to the upper body and head,” said Van Wyk. “Another was taken to the nearest hospital with a gunshot wound in her leg.” A murder case was opened and police were investigating. Van Wyk said no arrests have been made.
