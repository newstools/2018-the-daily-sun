THE ANC provincial task team in KZN has said the party’s elective conference will go ahead without problems this weekend. Addressing the media in Durban yesterday, co-ordinator Sihle Zikalala said he and convener Mike Mabuyakhulu had been meeting branch members in the three regions that went to court to stop the previous conference. Zikalala said branches were ready to start the conference tomorrow at the Durban University of Technology’s sport centre. He said the key problems raised by the regions that went to court had been resolved and outstanding issues would be dealt with. He said they had come to an out of court agreement. “We believe we will have a successful conference now,” he said. Mabuyakhulu said three key issues had been addressed. These were the re-run of branch meetings, the reconstruction of regional task teams in the Moses Mabhida, Lower South Coast and Harry Gwala regions, and the inclusion of members who had complained of being left out previously. On Monday, Daily Sun reported that some branches were still unhappy with the conference going ahead but Mabuyakhulu said nothing would disturb proceedings.
