COEGA Development Corporation held a graduation ceremony for 12 trainees who completed the clerk of works programme. The programme, which was launched in 2014 and is the first of its kind in South Africa, combines theory with practical training in bricklaying, plastering, plumbing, carpentry as well as site and project management. It lasted for 18 months. Since the programme was launched, none of its participants have dropped out. The programme is also known to attract quality candidates. Coega CEO Pepi Silinga said he was impressed with the programme’s success. He said to the graduates: “Your stories are precisely the reason these programmes are more important than the small number of people we are able to assist. “This programme is about a lot more than your participation. “It gives you the opportunity to change your life and the lives of those around you.” Richard Tyesi (30), one of the graduates, thanked Coega for empowering him. “On behalf of all of us, I would like to extend my deepest and most sincere gratitude. “My fellow graduates and I will make progress in the fields we received training for. “We are thankful for the opportunity and the fact that you invested in us. “However, we’re still hungry for more experience. “We want to be a part of bigger projects than the ones we’ve seen.”
