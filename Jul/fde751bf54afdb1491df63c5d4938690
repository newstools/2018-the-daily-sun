ACCORDING to Zola Mkiva, the land in the Ingonyama Trust was not stolen land, unlike the land in the hands of whites. Mkiva, the general secretary of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of SA was defending the words of King Goodwill Zwelithini on the land question. Mkiva and other traditional leaders held a joint media briefing with the EFF at the party’s headquarters in Braamfontein, Joburg yesterday. Mkiva said they were with the EFF because they believed the Constitution should be amended to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. They agreed with the EFF that the state must be the custodian of the land. Mkiva said: “The land under the Ingonyama Trust is in the hands of black people. We must not confuse this discussion with the discussion about stolen land. The land must be returned to its rightful owners. Expropriation without compensation should be aimed at stolen land.” Mkiva said they will hold a land summit with the EFF within six months. EFF leader Julius Malema said the king had the right to fight for the land. “Why should everybody else speak about this and not allow the king to speak? Other people have said worse things than the king,” said Malema. “The Boers said there will be blood on the floor if anyone dares touch their land and nobody said anything. “What the king has said we accept as a contribution.”
