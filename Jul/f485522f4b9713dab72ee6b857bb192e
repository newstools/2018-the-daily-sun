CAROL Carelse says she’s been surrounded by sewage for more than a year. The 56-year-old from extension 3 in Eldorado Park, south of Joburg, told Daily Sun she lived with her three grandkids in a flat and they survived on her disability grant. She said the problem started in June last year when she noticed that whenever someone flushed the toilet, the water bubbled up in the bath. “All the water and waste come through the pipes into the bath. “From there, it goes through other pipes and even into the kitchen sink where we prepare food,” she said. “We have no choice but to use the toilet as it’s the only one we have. “After someone uses the toilet, it’s a never-ending battle to get the waste down the drain. “At night, it gets even worse as the bathtub fills up with waste. I have to wake up in the early hours of the morning to drain the bath. If I don’t, the waste water fills the whole flat.” Carol said she got a quote from a plumber to fix the problem but couldn’t afford it. “This place is falling apart and no one gives a damn. “I got in touch with Fazel Jaffer from the councillor’s office, who helped me contact the Gauteng Human Settlements Department. They’ve done nothing but make promises.” Jaffer said he had been trying to help Carol for more than a year and all the information the department asked for was sent through. “They just say they’ve noted the issue and they’ll send someone to her house, but they never do,” he said. Human settlements spokesman Keith Khoza said they were aware of the issue and were waiting for the maintenance unit to report back.
