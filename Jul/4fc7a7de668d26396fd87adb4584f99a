SOUTH African motorists can brace themselves for another petrol price increase, which will see both grades of petrol, 93 and 95 hike by 26 cents and 23 cents a litre. The Department of Energy announced on Sunday that Diesel 0.05% sulphur and diesel 0.005% sulphur would also increase by 26 cents and 24 cents per litre. However, Mzansi motorists have been thrown a lifeline by the declining oil prices in June. According to un-audited month-end fuel price data that was released by the Central Energy Fund (CEF), if there was no decline in oil prices internationally there would have been a higher petrol price increase for the month of July. In a statement released by the Energy Minister Jeff Radebe the increase would have been 20 cent a litre more. Motorists currently have to pay R15.20 and R15.79 for a litre of 95 octane unleaded petrol on the coast and inland. In June, both grades of petrol 93 and 95 increased by a large 82c a litre, while Diesel 0.05% sulphur and diesel 0.005% sulphur increased by 85c and 87c a litre. Illuminating paraffin (wholesale) went up by 82c, while illuminating paraffin (SMNRP) cost 109c more per litre.
