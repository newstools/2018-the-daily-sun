ZANELE Blose said she is suffering because of her son, who is a whoonga addict. The 53-year-old mum from Umlazi V section said she lived in fear and what’s even worse is that her son, Phumlani Xaba (29), has disappeared. She said her problem started on 20 May when angry residents came to her house. They accused her son of stealing a cellphone and beat him up. Zanele said on the day of the incident, residents broke all her windows and almost burnt the house. She admitted Phumlani was once a troublemaker but said after spending 10 months in jail last year, he changed his ways. “He used to snatch residents’ bags and cellphones but in January, he came out of prison a new person. “I kept a close eye on his behaviour and I noticed there was no one complaining about him until the incident in May.” KZN police spokeswoman Nqobile Gwala said: “A case of malicious damage to property is being investigated by Umlazi cop shop and three suspects, aged between 26 and 42, were arrested.” She said the suspects were expected to appear in court this week. Gwala encouraged Zanele to speak to the station commander about a missing person’s case.
