Mamelodi Sundowns have announced the signing of young defender Tristan Moses from Kazer Chiefs. The 20 year- old was part of the team that lifted the Multichoice Diski Shield under Coach Arthur Zwane last season. The Brazilians wasted little time in snapping up the promising defender after his contract with the Glamour Boys expired last month. “Time to move onto my next challenge, I want to thank Kaizer Chiefs,” Moses said on Twitter, “My time spent there has moulded me into the man and player I am today. “I want to thank my family, teammates and the Amakhosi Faithful for all the love and support shown.”
