ANGRY workers at Kennedy Road squatter camp in Durban downed tools on Thursday after not being paid their June salaries. One of them told Daily Sun they worked for a company which received a tender from eThekwini Municipality’s Expanded Public Works Programme to install container toilets at the squatter camp. He said they started working on 27 March and were paid their full salaries as promised on 25 April. “But trouble started in May when we didn’t get our full salaries. “We continued working because the manager promised we would get the outstanding amount in June.” The worker said they went to the site as usual on Tuesday and Wednesday because they hoped to be paid. “We kept asking the manager about the money and he told us to wait. “We suspect the manager is running away from us because he’s not taking our phone calls. We will go back to work once they give us our money,” he said. When Daily Sun contacted the manager, he said he didn’t want to talk about the matter. “We’re not ignoring or running away from anyone. We will take you to court if you continue to write this article. “These people are lying because they did get paid,” he said before hanging up the phone. But the workers said the manager was lying and that they still hadn’t been paid. “He should give us our money and stop lying,” said one of the workers.
