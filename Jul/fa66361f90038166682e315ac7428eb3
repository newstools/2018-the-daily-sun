THREE cash van security guards are in hospital after they were injured on Wednesday. Their vehicle overturned after they were allegedly shot at while driving on the R33 road in Kwakopi near Greytown. Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said they were travelling towards Greytown after collecting cash from Msinga Mall. “While on the R33, their vehicle was shot at by unknown gunmen travelling in different vehicles,” he said. “This caused their vehicle to veer off the road and it rolled a few times, injuring the security guards.” He said the suspects made off with an undisclosed amount of money. “No one has been arrested yet. Cases of robbery and attempted murder were opened for investigation.” ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said: “Three security guards were found with minor injuries. “Apparently, they were injured when their vehicle overturned. Fidelity Security’s Wahl Bartmann said the guards were recovering. He said about 20 suspects fled with all the cash and three firearms in a navy-black double cab bakkie, a brown Fortuner and black BMW. “It isn’t practical to provide follow vehicles or air support for every trip,” he said. “Our helicopter was on call, but the time of the attack made it difficult for air support. We’re working closely with the Pietermaritzburg serious and violent crimes unit and following up on leads.” He said this month’s cash in transit heist statistics were worrying and such attacks should be made priority crimes.
