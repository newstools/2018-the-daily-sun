PATIENTS and relatives who scream at nurses and complain about hospital staff members waste their breath. That is according to Nehawu in Limpopo, where hospitals and clinics have been running low on medicines and blankets while services have dropped. The union said complaints should be directed to the political head of health in the province, insisting that is where the rot started. It called for the removal of Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba and accused her of failing to resolve problems. Provincial union secretary Jacob Adams said they wanted department head Peter Kgaphola to be fired. Adams said yesterday that standards had dropped so far, patients could not even get cough mixture. The union resolved to hold lunch-hour pickets at Mankweng and Polokwane hospitals. A march to the department’s offices, as well as to Treasury and the premier’s office, will take place next Friday. Union chairman Calvin Tshamano said they wanted to expose the problem so that people could direct their anger at the relevant people, not workers. The MEC and the union are due to meet today.
