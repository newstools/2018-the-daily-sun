Our favourite King of Kicks, Dr Malinga’s Idols SA dream has finally come true and we all get to witness it this Sunday. The musician will make an appearance on the show this Sunday as a guest judge helping to pick out the top tier of Tshwane’s singing talent. Speaking to TshisaLive, Dr Malinga said he had always dreamt of being on the show and hopes that this will lead to him being cast as a full-time judge. "I have been waiting for this for so long. It is like a dream come true. I wish I could be on Idols more because I love Idols and the judging panel. The people will decide. Maybe now they can make me the fourth judge on the show. But as a visitor it was a great experience, they were professional and it was a lot of fun,” he told the publication. Fans have also been calling for Malinga to be given a seat as a judge on the show and maybe, the powers that be are finally trying it out.
