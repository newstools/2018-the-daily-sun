ACCORDING to the cops, she was already seven months pregnant when the 30-year-old woman and her 26-year-old lover decided to abort the child. They also allegedly decided to bury the foetus in their shack. It appears that the couple from Afghanistan squatter camp in Bekkersdal, Gauteng had been together for about five years when she fell pregnant. She allegedly aborted the baby on 3 December and buried the body in the shack. It appears the boyfriend had bought some liquid at a taxi rank which she drank. The two kept their secret until about three weeks ago when the woman dumped the man. To spite her, he allegedly posted on Facebook that there was a grave behind the door of the woman’s shack. Concerned neighbours informed the cops who went to the shack. The couple allegedly confessed to the cops and showed them where they had buried the stillborn under the cement floor. When the cops opened the small, shallow grave, they found the baby wrapped in plastic. Residents said they were surprised to see that the woman had a flat stomach and wondered where she had taken the baby. “We thought she miscarried and the hospital had cleaned her,” said a neighbour. “We were shocked when the cops came to fetch her and her boyfriend.” Warrant Officer Raymond Sebonyane confirmed the incident. He said the two suspects will appear in Westonaria Magistrates Court soon for murder.
