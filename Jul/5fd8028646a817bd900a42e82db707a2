Rapper, Nasty C was forced to swallow his words this week after he clapped back at a fan over a misunderstanding. One of Nasty’s fans tweeted and paid him compliment saying that his music was so good, it was almost as if he is cheating. But Nasty misread the tweet and assumed that the fan was calling him boring and like all your faves, he loaded his gun and started firing shots. "Suck a d*ck," Nasty responded to the compliment. It was only after people started dragging him for what he did that he re-read the tweet and then understood what was said. “My bad bro. I misread ‘uyaroba’ thought u said ‘uyabhora’... I apologize,” he said. He felt so bad that he had to put out another tweet, explaining his actions. “Got up on the wrong side of the bed. Misread a tweet and offended somebody. My bad bro,” he went on. Twitter were not having it though, with lots of people calling Nasty out for “reading to respond and not to understand”. The whole thing turned into a conversation about how celebs are so defensive that they turn on their own fans sometimes for nothing at all.
