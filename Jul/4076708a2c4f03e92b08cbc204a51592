YOU might not know Doctor Malinga (45), but he’s rated the 11th best blind bowler in the world. Doctor, from Katlehong in Ekurhuleni, plays for Central Gauteng Blind Cricket. Last year, he represented Mzansi at the Blind Cricket World Cup in India. “Our bowling technique is underarm, while players who can see use the overarm method,” said Doctor. “The only other difference are the balls we use. They make a sound that allows us to hear where they are.” The cricketer lost his sight in 1998. “All I saw was darkness. Luckily, I was already home when that happened. “When I went to sleep I thought I would be fine but I was still blind when I woke up. “After eight years I started to learn braille. “It wasn’t easy because my fingers were stiff.” Doctor said being blind comes with a number of challenges. He said he can’t hold his umbrella and walking stick at the same time during a rainstorm. “I also get distracted by the sound of the rain, which makes it difficult to listen for cars.” He said his dream is to play in the T20 Blind Cricket World Cup, which will take place in 2023. “Blind people should know that their condition doesn’t mean they can’t make their dreams come true,” he said. Doctor said there’s hope for all of them.
