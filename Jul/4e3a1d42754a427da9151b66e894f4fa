THE family of Xolani Gwala have thanked Mzansi for their support during his battle with colon cancer. According to Gwala's wife Peggy Khumalo, the radio anchor had an operation on 16 June which was a success. Speaking to Talk Radio 702 his wife Peggy Khumalo said they’re deeply grateful to his medical team, Dr Ogude, Dr Marumo, and his assistants for their "powerful bravery and humbleness for taking the risks they did given the complexity of Xolani’s cancer." “We want to take a moment first to thank each and every one of you for your love, prayers, healing light, support, comments, stories, goodies, emails... the list seems endless. We were completely OVERWHELMED the past 10 months by the sheer magnitude of love, caring, prayers and thoughtfulness that YOU have shown us,” Peggy Khumalo said. She said last week the doctors confirmed that Xolani is now cancer free and is now in remission. In 2017, speaking to Stephen Grootes, Gwala confirmed that he had been diagnosed with colon cancer. “In April I ran the London marathon. I was also doing marathons around here,” he said. The talk show host said he went to doctors because he had a fever. They did tests and told him he had cancer. “Not just cancer but advanced cancer,” he said at the time.
