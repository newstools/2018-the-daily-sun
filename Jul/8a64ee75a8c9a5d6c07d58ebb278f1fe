VUSI Zuma, the son of former president Jacob Zuma and Kate Mantsho, was buried on Saturday. A moving private service for the 25-year-old, who died last week, was held at Rhema Bible Church in Randburg, Joburg. Vusi was buried at Westpark Cemetery. The former president apparently explained to mourners why the media was prevented from attending. According to the Sunday Times, he said Vusi suffered after reading cruel things about his father and this worsened his condition. Family spokeswoman Linda Makatini asked the media to stay away so as to give the family privacy. Hundreds of people gathered at the service on Saturday to pay their last respects. They included Home Affairs Minister Melusi Gigaba, Higher Education and Training Minister Naledi Pandor and Police Minister Bheki Cele. Vusi was described by those who knew him as a humble person who was kind to anyone and everyone. Â­
