Iconic Mostwako rapper, Hip Hop Pantsula (HHP) seems to be living in a world full of drama these days. Despite his recent drama with producer, Beat Junky, HHP is also in some sort of legal battle with Universal Music over the release of his next album. The rapper, whose real name is Jabulani Tsambo, was meant to have already released his 10th and final studio album earlier this month. But according to him, the label under which the album will be released, Universal Music, is being a pain in the butt. HHP told Zkhiphani all about the beef he has with the global music giant. “I’ve been working on my last album, the drama album, and I was supposed to go independent with it but last minute Universal showed interest in it so I came back to hear what they were saying,” he started. “I signed with them and right now they are the worst people to work with. I’m going through some legalities with them, I don’t know what’s going on with Universal. When their periods are done, they’ll let me know,” he continued. He didn’t really get into the details of what the “legalities” are about, but whatever it is, it is big enough to halt the release of the album. But the rapper says that he will drop an EP in the meantime. “I’ve decided to put out an EP because I really just want to give my fans music because I’m a musician. I’m gonna be giving out some free music. I’m hoping to have the EP ready in the next two weeks,” he told the publication. He said he is thinking of calling the EP ‘Feels Good To Be Back’. HHP has been in the music industry for 19 years now, having released 9 albums and countless hits.
