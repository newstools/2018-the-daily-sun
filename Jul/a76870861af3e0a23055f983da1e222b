Seems like we can all forget about ever seeing actress, Thuso Mbedu and TV presenter, Dr Musa Mthombeni walking down the aisle. Or even dating for that matter! A few months ago Musa shared his deep affection for Thuso with the whole country on social media after he ran into her on the South African Film and Television Awards red-carpet. He then went on to tweet that his mother was waiting for grandkids from Musa and Thuso. Well, Thuso says that dream will never see the light of day. The Emmy-nominated actress was speaking to the Fresh Breakfast team on Metro FM this past Monday, where she put all rumours to rest. When asked about her future kids with Musa, she said: “You can picture them in your mind, because that’s where they would be forever” “I can be a godmother to his future kids. That way, but otherwise, eish guys. There’s definitely nothing between myself and Musa Mthombeni,” she continued.
