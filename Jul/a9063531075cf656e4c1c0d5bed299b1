GOING to school is not easy for pupils from the Ikageng Village in Rustenburg, North West. Pupils from Lerutlhware Primary School in Mosenthal Village have to cross a river to get to school. Parents wait by the riverside to carry them across the river. Some cry with fear, others slip on the stepping rocks, some fall and go to school wet and cold. When it rains heavily, the river gets full and dangerous, forcing the kids to either stay home or be extremely careful as they tip-toe on the slippery rocks. Some pupils walk over 15 kilometers to Matetenene High School in Rankelenyane village. These pupils are suffering because their scholar buses have stopped collecting them. It is suspected the contractor was not paid and the buses were returned to the rental company. Thulani Bika, a community leader, said the Department of Education offered scholar transport, but took away the buses belonging to the service provider at Lerutlhware primary. “We are in the dark as to what is happening. The one bus by another service providers cannot carry all 1 300 primary school kids and 980 high school kids. “One bus is allowed to take 65 passengers, but each bus is already transporting over 300 kids. This is dangerous and risky for our kids. That’s why they cross the river. We wrote letters and spoke to the department, but there were no answers. We are now thinking of protesting,” he said. The spokesperson for Department of Education in North West, Freddy Sepeng, promised to respond to Daily Sun’s questions on Wednesday, but did not.
