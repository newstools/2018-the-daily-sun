EQUIPMENT was stolen, sold to a hair salon owner and then hidden in a church. The hair salon owner thought the equipment would not be found. This was after two suspects broke into a shack and stole a CPU box, monitor, keyboard, sound system cords and a mixer. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said residents in Phomolong kasi, Free State, alerted the cops to the two burglars. It led to the arrest of two suspects aged 22 and 29. “The items were allegedly stolen on 15 July. The suspects allegedly set the shack on fire after stealing the items. We suspect that they were trying to hide evidence. The suspects were charged with arson, housebreaking and theft.” Thakeng said investigations led them to the hair salon owner (42), who took them to a church where the stolen items were hidden. “The pastor opened the storeroom for the police and the items were found inside. “The salon owner was arrested and charged with possession of suspected stolen items. The three suspects will appear before the Welkom Magistrates Court soon,” he said. Welkom station commander, Brigadier Disebo Cezula said: “I am very proud of Sergeant Seleke Khosana, Sergeant Andrew Lechesa and Constable Bafedile Dube for their dedication and commitment to following up on information brought forward by residents, who are sick and tired of criminals.”
