Mzansi made history by becoming the first country in the world to take a bold step in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The currently available injectable drug had nasty side effects but the oral medicine, bedaquiline, shows good results when treating adolescents and adults with MDR-TB. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has welcomed the Department of Health’s announcement to roll-out bedaquiline. It sees the new oral medicine as a positive move towards better MDR-TB treatments. “The current standard treatment for MDR-TB is the injectable but it is effective only 50% of the time. It also has to include a painful injection of an antibiotic known to cause terrible side effects including kidney failure and hearing loss. Bedaquiline tests shows it improved outcomes among MDR-TB sufferers without needing the antibiotic injection,” said Dr Anja Reuter, MSF member and doctor working at a Khayelitsha drug-resistant-TB programme in the Western Cape. MSF, which has run the programme since 2007, urges government to speed up the rollout of bedaquiline and other new drugs as well as manufacturers to drop prices. While more than half a million people are infected with MDR-TB all over the world every year, only a handful have access to new TB drugs such as bedaquiline. MSF also asked other countries to follow South Africa’s progressive example.
