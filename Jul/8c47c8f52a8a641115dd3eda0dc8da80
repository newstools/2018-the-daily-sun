SINCE the beginning of the year, there have been nearly 180 attacks on cash-in-transit vans. Yesterday in Midrand, Joburg, Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane introduced new technology to reduce the number of robberies. The product is called a polyurethane dispensing unit and it was developed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. It’s designed to protect the cash in the vault of a van by absorbing the blast of a bomb, keeping the vehicle whole. It then covers the contents of the vault in a foam so robbers can’t access it. The product can be activated either by the driver or crew members. It can also be activated from the command centres of cash-in-transit companies. If the vehicle is forced off the road or tilted more than 45 degrees, it automatically activates. Graeme King, the CEO of AllCash, said the product was available to all cash-in-transit companies. Nkosi-Malobane said: “We intend to send a strong message that we are ready to protect the money and innocent lives. We are aware of robbers’ arrogance and we will deal with it decisively.” She said they would oppose bail in the cases of those arrested.
