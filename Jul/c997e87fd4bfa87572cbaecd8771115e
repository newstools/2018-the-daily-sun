DA leader Mmusi Maimane said Mzansi’s murder rate made the country look like a country at war with itself. At Nyanga cop shop in Cape Town yesterday, Maimane called on Police Minister Bheki Cele to intervene. “We have to stand up against crime,” he said. “Our girls can’t walk freely and people are killed. “We shouldn’t be living as if things are normal. “There are too many murders for a country that’s not at war.” Maimane, Western Cape DA leader Bonginkosi Madikizela and Community Safety MEC Dan Plato were touring the station after meeting with its commander, Brigadier Vuyisile Ncata. Madikizela said: “The province’s population grew by 100% over 20 years. Police resources haven’t kept up.” He said Nyanga had the lowest cops to residents ratio in the province. Maimane said the army should be deployed and that he’d march to the station to call for urgent measures.
