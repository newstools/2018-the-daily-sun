The photos were posted on a Facebook group called Police Pics and Clips. The post has the message: “The policeman, stationed at Westville Police Station in Durban, passed out at the entrance to a major mall in the area on Friday morning. “According to witnesses, the member reeked of alcohol and was clearly under the influence. He had a gun and pepper spray on him.” KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said: “The cluster commander is personally investigating this matter with a view to instituting an internal departmental investigation.”
