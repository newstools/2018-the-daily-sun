SOUTH AFRICA Under-20 coach Thabo Senong has revealed that they’ve started negotiations with the Absa Premiership and other clubs to avoid the country-versus-clubs predicament next year. Amajita qualified for the Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), which is set to take place in Niger from 24 February to 10 March next year. And coach Senong is planning to have proper preparations ahead of the tournament, which will also serve as the Under-20 Fifa World Cup qualifier. He doesn’t want to see what happened last year, when some clubs refused to release their Under-20 players when Amajita were preparing for the Afcon, which took place in Zambia. That saw Senong not having proper preparations ahead of the tournament. Despite all these challenges, Amajita managed to finish in the top three and booked their ticket to South Korea’s Fifa World Cup, which was played from June to July. During their preparations for the world showpiece, where they also had a European tour, it was the same case with clubs refusing to release players. And that had a negative impact as the boys were eliminated in the group stages of the world showpiece in South Korea. Talking in a media press conference on Thursday, Senong said: ““We don’t want the country versus club issue again. “We’ve started engaging with clubs to get players next year who will represent the country in Niger.”We sit down with coaches of different clubs, the relationship has improved. He continued: “We need to go back now to give them feedback of the progress of our national team.”
