TWO security guards were working night shift and made a plan to keep warm. They didn’t know the imbawula they started would endanger their lives. The men were guarding an abandoned house in Allen’s Nek, Roodepoort, on Sunday when one of them died after inhaling fumes from the brazier. The property is owned by the department of public works. It’s understood that the guards took the imbawula into the house and closed the windows and doors to keep the cold out. Department’s spokesman Thami Mchunu confirmed that the two guards were hired last Wednesday to look after the abandoned house. “We’re very saddened by this turn of events and we’re in contact with their families,” Mchunu said. Police spokesman Captain Tinyiko Mathebula told the Peoples Paper that an inquest docket was opened by the Honeydew police. “At about 3am, a 43-year-old man was found dead inside an abandoned building. “It is alleged that the dead man was on guard duties with his colleague (28) when he inhaled toxic fumes from imbawula, which they had lit to keep warm. "The 28-year-old man was taken to Flora Clinic in Florida,” he said.
