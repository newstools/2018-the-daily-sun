THE Gcaza family from Khayelitsha in Cape Town were shocked when they woke up to find a scary note, blood and cut-up liver on their doorstep on Friday morning! Phumzile Gcaza (26) said: “The note mentions my name and says my sister and I have 21 days left to say our goodbyes to the world.” He said they didn’t know if the liver belonged to a human or an animal. “Some people here think it’s a human liver. A resident said it belonged to a human because he’d never seen an animal with a black liver.” His sister said she didn’t have enemies. “They didn’t write my name but said my brother’s sister, and that’s me. I’m scared,” she said. “At about 11pm, I heard people knocking but told myself I wouldn’t go out because it might be criminals.” The note said she and her brother would be killed but their kids and madala’s lives would be spared. “I don’t know who’d want to kill me because I didn’t wrong anyone and don’t want to leave my kids. My father is an old man,” she said. The family don’t know what to do and won’t move because they have nowhere else to go. “We’re afraid of what will happen when the 21 days are over, but we trust God to protect us as we don’t know what else to do,” they said. Sangoma Khanyisile Kheswa said it could be that someone was just trying to scare the family. “People usually do these things to scare other people and won’t actually carry out their threats.” She said the family must burn the mat on which the liver was placed and use traditional herbs for cleansing. “They must trust in God because he’s our saviour.”
