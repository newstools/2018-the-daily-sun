MORE gruesome murders have rocked Newtown Village near Mthatha, Eastern Cape. This comes after a 54-year-old woman and her two sons, aged seven and 10, were brutally hacked to death on Sunday. A six-year-old girl was left seriously injured and rushed to hospital. Mthatha police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said the family was attacked by unknown people at their home. “Their badly wounded bodies were found lying in a pool of blood by a neighbour who heard a cry from the homestead and alerted the police,” said Koena. “It is suspected that the killers broke down the door before entering the house. “The motive for the killing is not known at this stage and no arrests have been made yet.” Acting cluster commander Brigadier Nomawethu Makonza condemned the killing of innocent women and children. She vowed to make sure that those behind this attack were arrested. “It is sad that there are people who continue to terrorise women and children. “The police are committed to protecting the vulnerable. We call on communities to work together with the police in rooting out the perpetrators of these crimes,” she said Makonza urged anyone with information to contact Captain Thandaza Mshumi on 082 442 0585 or on the CrimeStop number 0860 10111.
