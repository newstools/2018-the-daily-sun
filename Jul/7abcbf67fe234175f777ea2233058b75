ONICCA Moloi has resigned and her resignation has been accepted. But the party wants her to explain her conduct. The ANC’s secretary in Limpopo, Soviet Lekganyane, said Moloi’s conduct undermined the integrity of both the organisation and government. He said they had been trying to meet Moloi so she could explain herself. “Members who feel aggrieved in any way are expected to use the available channels to raise their concerns,” said Lekganyane. He said the ANC expected a cadre of her calibre to handle the matter differently. Lekganyane said they would like to hear her side before they took any decision regarding her conduct. She wrote on her Facebook page: “We will send our resignation letters and hand over your so called ‘blue lights’ by Friday to make your job easy. We didn’t join the ANC for blue lights.’’ Lekganyane said: “We condemn the behaviour and conduct of our leaders in the provincial legislature who disrespect the party. They must know that we don’t deploy them because they are smarter than others but because we respect their efforts.” He said people must not turn their backs on the water source after drinking from it. “Some were found in desperate situations, while others were thinking of taking their own lives. But after the ANC touched their lives all that changed,” said Lekganyane.
