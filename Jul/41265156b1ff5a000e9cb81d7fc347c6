POPULAR DJ and businessman Sbu Leope is an angry man. The owner of online radio station Massive Metro is furious at a foreign doctor known as Dr Zimwe, who used his face for an ad in which he claimed he could cure Aids! Sbu shared a screenshot of the Facebook ad on Instagram, in which Dr Zimwe says he has a cure for Aids which lasts five years. The advert claims he can cure clients with spirulina and has a fake testimonial from DJ Sbu, in which he says the doctor cured him of Aids. Speaking to Daily Sun about the ad, an angry Sbu said people were using his name to promote their products. “I’m extremely disappointed at how our brothers and sisters are taking short cuts to make money while preying on brands we worked so hard to build,” he said. “I worked very hard building my Mofaya Beverage, Massiv Metro and our entrepreneurship school Hustlers Academy, collectively employ and train 100 young South Africans.” He said he was disappointed. “I’ve taken legal action against the perpetrators and I’ve been advised by my legal team not to say anything further.” Dr Zimwe was not online when the SunTeam tried to send him a WhatsApp message. It contains vitamins, minerals and high protein levels. It can be used to boost energy, reduce inflammation, improve the immune system, and provide support to the organs. But it can’t cure HIV or Aids.
