FORMER Judge Robert Nugent has ruled that the SARS
commission on inquiry will not stop. This after lawyers for the tax agency's former
commissioner Tom Moyane wanted it stopped. Moyane’s lawyers also asked the judge to rule that all the
evidence of the past three days be expunged from the record. The Presidency served suspended SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane
with disciplinary charges in May. This relates to alleged misconduct in violation of his
duties and responsibilities in terms of the South African Revenue Service Act,
Public Finance Management Act and SARS Code of Conduct. Retired Constitutional Court Judge Kate O’Regan has been
appointed as presiding officer for the disciplinary inquiry. The inquiry will be conducted in writing to make findings,
subject to the presiding officer’s discretion to hear oral evidence. This approach has been chosen to ensure a procedurally fair
and speedy disciplinary process. The disciplinary inquiry relates to alleged leadership and
organisational failures. A separate process through, the establishment of a
Commission of Inquiry, will focus on tax administrative issues like VAT refunds
and shortfalls in revenue in the past two financial years.
