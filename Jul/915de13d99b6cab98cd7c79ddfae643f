A YOUNG man desperate for the hand of his first love took
the apparent challenge from his beloved’s dad and shot himself to prove his
love. Unfortunately Atul Lokhande (30) didn’t live to marry the
27-year-old love of his life. According to India TV News, Atul was declared brain dead after
he took the dramatic step earlier this month. Hindustan Times reported that Atul had a furious
argument with his love’s dad earlier that day. In a Facebook post written half-an-hour before he shot
himself, Lokhande wrote the woman's father had asked him to come to their house
and “prove his love” by killing himself. "Her father asked me to visit their home in the
evening and kill myself to prove that I love his daughter. If I survived, he
would let me marry her. I am at her residence, take me away from here (if I
die). If I survive, I will come back on my own," he said in the long
message. Atul also wrote that "the more inter-caste and
inter-religious marriages happen, the more organic India will become." Atul, who was a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s
youth wing, went to his girlfriend’s house in Bhopal in central India at about
9.30pm armed with a revolver. The two had apparently been close since they were kids. It is unclear which part of his body he aimed at, but by
midnight that night he was in hospital and had been declared brain dead. Indian TV News reported that Atul’s family decided his
organs like heart, kidneys, liver and eyes be harvested to help other people. His family also reportedly want to lay a charge of assisted
suicide against the woman’s family.
