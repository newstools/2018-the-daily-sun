EVERY time residents walk down this street, they have to take a deep breath and close their mouths and noses. That’s because they don’t want to breathe in the smell of kak. Sewage has been flooding the kasi streets for the past three months in Marapong outside Lephalale, Limpopo. The residents said they have reported the matter several times to the local municipality but nothing has been done. They claim no one attended to their problem. Timothy Magakanya (44), whose house is in the affected street, said he is forced to keep his house closed all the time to prevent the horrible smell from coming in. “I have given up on our municipality. “I reported the flooding sewage several times but I was told their truck was broken. “I understood back then but if it takes up to three months for them to fix it, then it is poor service delivery.” He said he doesn’t know why the municipality is not unblocking the flood of sewage because in previous years, they used to come immediately once it was reported. Thuso Matlou (26) works at a car wash next to the flooded street. He said: “This sewage smell has cost me clients. “They have moved to other car washes in another section of the township.” Lephalale municipal spokeswoman Conscious Chiloane said the matter has been forwarded to their maintenance team for investigation.
