MANY people are suffering from dreadful diseases without being aware of it. PinkDrive, the organisation committed to improving breast cancer awareness and education, provided cancer screening to the people of Soshanguve, Tshwane. SunHealth spoke to Ephenia Makhubela (66) who went to have her breast examined. “Women my age need to regularly check everything about our health.” Makhubela said now that she’s getting older, her body was becoming an easier target for diseases. Paulos Tshabalala (68) went to learn about prostate cancer. “I experienced a pain in my manhood whenever I peed – it was burning. “I went to hospital twice and while I was helped, I didn’t get to find out if I had any prostate problems or not.” Paulos said many people were sick with something. They are always coughing and spitting all over the place. “This is why we catch TB and other terrible illnesses.” Noelene Kotschan, CEO and founder of PinkDrive, said she was excited about two taxis donated to them by Mzansi’s Japanese embassy. The embassy wanted them to provide healthcare services. The extra vehicles will greatly improve the organisation’s reach. “The donation of equipped units to PinkDrive is a sign of the social worth of the services it provides to all the medically uninsured people in South Africa.” Deputy minister of social development, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, also attended the event as did other organisations.
