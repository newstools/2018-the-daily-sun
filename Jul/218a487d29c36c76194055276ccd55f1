WHEN the People’s Paper last visited Mmapula Manyaku (48) of Wonderkop near Brits, North West, she and her mum Elsie were trapped in their house. Both had pus oozing from infected holes in their swollen legs, leaving them crippled and fearing for their lives. But today, Mmapula is beaming with relief after SunPower came to her rescue. Soon after Daily Sun reported last March on their life of hell, both were admitted to Job Shimankana Tabane Provincial Hospital in Rustenburg. Sadly, Elsie died in hospital and the People’s Paper reported on her funeral in May. But Mmapula has received a second chance at life! She was sent home with a pressure wound therapy machine. She has to plug in the machine and insert the tube into the bandage covering her wound to drain it. Her leg has shrunk dramatically. Mmapula sat hugging the machine like a baby, saying it saved her from a life of pain.“I cannot begin to say how thankful I am to Daily Sun for your help. “I have forgotten what pain feels like. “This machine I got from the hospital has done wonders,” she said. “My leg feels and looks lighter.” Walking out with the SunTeam, she started dancing. “Look, I can even dance,” she said. But due to lack of funds, she has missed some hospital appointments to clean the wound and said she hoped caregivers would be sent to her home to help her.
