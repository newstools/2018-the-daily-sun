THEIR children were allegedly told to leave the school because they did not have the money to pay for an English workshop. Parents of 80 grade 12 pupils at Uxolophambini Secondary School in Hammarsdale, west of Durban, said they were worried their kids would be left behind in their studies while they were sitting at home. They said this was because they could not pay R40 each for an English workshop at the school on Tuesday. The parents urged the KZN Education Department to intervene. A parent who asked not to be named said she did not expect the principal to act like that. She said her child told her the principal said they should not come back to school until 2 August and to bring their parents. “I have no permanent job as I survive by doing laundry for other residents in my area. “The principal is fully aware of the situation, so I was surprised by his action,” said the parent. Another parent said they hoped the department would take action. “This is bad for our children as we expect them to get good matric results. I did not give my son money for the workshop because I did not have it, but I did not think he would be suspended for that,” the parent said. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the department was not aware of the matter, but an inspector would visit the school to get the facts. “I am surprised by this because school workshops are usually free. Even the teachers’ workshops are free. I wonder what kind of workshop requires money. But we will get the facts,” said Mahlambi.
