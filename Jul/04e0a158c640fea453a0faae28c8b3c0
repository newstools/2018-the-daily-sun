THE Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) arrested a corrupt licensing examiner at the Xavier Street Testing Centre for corruption. The male examiner was arrested by the JMPD’S Internal Affairs Fraud and Corruption Unit on Tuesday. The 40-year-old man was arrested after Internal Affairs members received a tip-off, that a corrupt examiner took a R5000 bribe from a learner, in order to get a driver’s license. “The arresting officers discovered a test result in the young drivers name without the learner driver having undergone the driving test,” Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department’s spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said. Minnaar said the suspect was searched and R5000 was found in his pocket. “He is detained at Booysens Police Station,” Minnaar said. Minnaar said the JMPD Chief of Police Mr David Tembe has commended the officers for the arrest. "This kind of corruption defeats the ongoing efforts by law enforcement agencies of reducing road carnages. We will continue working continuously in rooting out bribery and corruption in the City of Johannesburg," Minnaar said.
