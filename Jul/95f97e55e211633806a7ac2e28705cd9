RAPPER Emtee had to be carried off the stage after falling twice during a performance on Saturday. The rapper, whose real name is Mthembeni Ndevu, was booked to perform at the fifth annual Lephalale Black ’N White Party in Limpopo. Several videos filmed by fans showed the rapper performing his hit track Roll-Up before falling on his back. He got up, only to fall again after losing his balance. Following the incident, angry fans accused him of disrespecting them by performing while clearly drunk or high. They took to social media to demand their money back. Yesterday, Emtee wrote on Twitter: “I just fell on stage. I’m not on drugs and I don’t have health issues, either. I got back up and carried on performing.” He later deleted the tweet. Event organiser Sello Kgageng said people who attended the event were angry. “According to me, he didn’t perform and his record label Ambitiouz Entertainment should have called me to apologise or give me a refund, but they haven’t,” said Sello. “I need my money back or something equivalent to what I paid for him.” Kalawa Jazzmee founder DJ Oskido called on BET Awards winner Sjava to assist Emtee, who’s on the same record label as him. This isn’t the first time Emtee has caused a stir. Last year, he accidentally showed his 4-5 to fans on social media. Ambitiouz Entertainment promised to send a media statement but had not responded to queries by the time of going to print.
