WHEN her boyfriend asked Aletta Magotweni to wash his feet on Sunday, little did she know it would almost cost her life. While she was busy washing his feet, she felt something hard against her head. When she looked up, she found her boyfriend was holding a hacksaw and had just started to cut her head with it. The 27-year-old from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun as soon as she realised she was bleeding from the head, she stood up – but her boyfriend tried to pin her down again. She does not know where she got the strength from, but she eventually managed to wrest the hacksaw away from him. Hearing Aletta screaming, neighbours rushed to the scene and got her away. They pulled the boyfriend out of the couple’s shack and gave him a brutal beating. He is now in hospital fighting for his life. Aletta was taken to a local clinic for treatment and was later discharged. She then left the shack to move in with friends. “I am still shocked. I do not know how that man could have done this to me. If my neighbours had not acted fast, I might have been dead by now,” she said. Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said a case of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm was opened at Etwatwa cop shop.
