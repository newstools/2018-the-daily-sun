THE municipal manager of North Westâ€™s Mahikeng Municipality, Thabo Mokwena, yesterday fired back at allegations that he was the mastermind behind corruption. It has been a tough week for the embattled Mokwena. The SA National Civic Organisation joined the chorus of accusations that he was responsible for fraud and maladministration in the municipality. Sanco also indicated it would support a motion for Mokwena be removed from his position. He is accused of investing municipal money with VBS Mutual Bank, which has gone under curatorship. A council meeting to unseat Mokwena was postponed on Tuesday. Yesterday, Mokwena came out guns blazing during a press briefing. He said Sanco leaders were targeting him because he refused to give them tenders for projects. He also claimed that a journalist at the SABC, who also wanted a tender, was trying to tarnish his name through false reporting. According to Mokwena, people are being paid money to cause service delivery protests when the municipality is actually providing services. He said Mahikeng Municipality invested only R25 million with VBS bank, while another R60 million was invested by default when the department of co-operative governance and traditional affairs overpaid the municipality. The municipality is taking legal action against the revolutionary council which is accused of organising violent service delivery protests in Mahikeng during the Supra Mahumapelo uprising.
