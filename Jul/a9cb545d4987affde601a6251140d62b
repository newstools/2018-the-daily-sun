THE construction of tar roads near their home has brought pain and sorrow to the Nkosi family. Members of the family in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun that workers left huge holes in their yard, leaving them with nowhere to park their cars and exposed to crime. They said a month ago, the municipality dug up their yard to put in a storm water drain but workers never returned to close up the holes again. They said the workers were still in the area but that they had moved on to a different site. Shirley Nkosi (50) said they were forced to beg neighbours to allow them to park their cars in their yards and lived in fear as anyone could walk on to their property. There were also three toddlers in the family who could easily fall into the holes. Shirley said she was never even informed that the workers would be digging holes in her yard. “As a community, we were told tar roads were being constructed. I was happy because we were finally receiving service delivery,” she said. “But nobody asked for permission to go through my yard. I was shocked when I found holes all over my yard and my vegetable garden destroyed.” Shirley said she had been growing vegetables to feed her family. “I don’t know how I’m supposed to feed my grandchildren now that my garden is gone. I have complained many times to the site managers without any success,” she said. Municipal spokesman Zweli Dlamini said: “When we deliver services, we don’t want to distract communities. We expect them to celebrate instead of complaining. But it’s unacceptable for workers to go into the owner’s yard without permission.” He said the matter would be thoroughly investigated.
