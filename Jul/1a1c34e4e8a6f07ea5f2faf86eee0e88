RESIDENTS of Bester, north of Durban said they are on the verge of becoming ill. They said the pit toilets which were built years ago in their kasi are filthy and smell like kak. They said they’ve been complaining to the ward 54 councillor for a long time but nothing has been done. A 35-year-old resident said a toilet was built just inches away from her front door in 2010 and has only been cleaned once. “When these toilets were built, we were told they would be cleaned at least once a year to ensure they don’t pose a health hazard but eThekwini Municipality has not kept its promise.” The resident said the situation gets worse daily especially after it has rained. “I think rain water gets into the pit and causes worms to come out and crawl into our kitchens,” said residents. Another resident (42) said they didn’t understand why the municipality built the pit toilets so close to their houses. “We suffer every day, even on a normal days when it’s sunny because the smell is unbearable. “We have learnt to keep our doors closed to keep the smell out of our living spaces,” she said. She said some residents suffered from TB and diarrhoea and they blame the toilets. The residents said they want the municipality to clean the toilets before people start dying. Mandla Nsele, acting eThekwini municipal spokesman, said: “The process to empty the toilets is underway at Bester and KwaMashu L section. “An emergency extension to empty these toilets was approved by the council recently and the contractor is expected to resume the work soon. “The city apologises for the inconvenience caused.”
