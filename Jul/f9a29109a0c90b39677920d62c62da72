DROPPING Kgalema Motlanthe’s recommendations to dissolve the Ingonyama Trust was simply a political move. University of Cape Town lecturer Bheki Mngomezulu said the ANC had no choice but to drop Motlanthe’s recommendation because it was going to cost the party the votes of too many rural people. Mngomezulu said after the party was also attacked by its own Congress of Traditional Leaders, it realised it had to dismiss Motlanthe’s recommendation. “The ANC was under pressure to take a political decision, otherwise it would find itself on the opposition benches. It underestimated the influence of traditional leaders,” said Mngomezulu. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Friday that the government would not implement Motlanthe’s recommendation to dissolve the king’s trust. Ramaphosa was addressing the Pentecostal Church Service in Empangeni, KZN. He met the king at Richards Bay and on Saturday addressed ANC supporters in KwaDukuza, where he launched the Thuma Mina, (Send Me) campaign in the province. Ramaphosa told thousands of party supporters the land in rural areas would be administered by traditional leaders. Judge Jerome Ngwenya, chairman of the Ingonyama Trust, said the king and the trust welcomed government’s announcement but would wait for the full details because both parties agreed to have a meeting. Political parties in the province warned the king and traditional leaders not to trust the ANC on this issue.
