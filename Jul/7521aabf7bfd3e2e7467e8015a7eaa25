SHE took her child to hospital because he was ill, but he came out worse off than when he went in! The 40-year-old mother from Hammarsdale, west of Durban claimed her 14-year-old son went to the RK Khan Hospital in Chatsworth with appendicitis, but needed three operations because of negligence. The sad mother told Daily Sun the three operations left her son’s testicles swollen and he couldn’t walk properly. “I first took him to hospital in March this year where they treated the appendix. “After two days they discharged him and he looked fine,” she said. The mother said a week later his testicles started to hurt. “I thought it was normal because of the operation. But when his testicles started swelling in April I took him back to hospital. A doctor told me water had built up and they needed to operate again to drain the water caused by an error during the first operation,” she said. “They did the second operation and he was discharged after two days.” But a few days later his condition became worse and she had to take him back to hospital for a check-up. “Again, the doctor told me they needed to operate to clean his testicles because it looked as if bacteria was causing the swelling,” she said. “He had a third operation. But after the third operation nothing changed. “He hasn’t been to school since April. I need the health department to arrange a specialist for my son.” Daily Sun sent an email to KZN Department of Health spokesman Agiza Hlongwane on Thursday. An automatic response referred the paper to his colleagues, Sibongiseni Mkhize and Ncumisa Mafunda. The paper sent emails to his colleagues on the same day as well as on Friday, but there were no replies.
