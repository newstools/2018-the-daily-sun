WHILE the South African Reserve Bank celebrated the launch of new bank notes with images of Madiba, not everybody was happy with the changes. Some people on social media argued that Mandela has been given too much credit while other freedom fighters were ignored. They drew their own preferred bank notes, with the faces of other late struggle heroes such as Oliver Tambo, Steve Biko, Winnie Mandela and Chris Hani. On Twitter @Lithalenyanga1 wrote: “Why not Chris Hani?” The Reserve Bank launched the bank notes, to commemorate Tata’s 100th birthday, at Freedom Park in Tshwane on Friday. Mzansi people can expect to see the new Mandela notes and R5 coins at their local banks and ATMs soon. The bank notes capture the life of Madiba from when he was born in Eastern Cape to when he became the first democratically elected president of South Africa in 1994. The head of currency management, Pradeep Maharaj, told the media they will continue to circulate the new notes over the next few months. Reserve Bank governer Lesetja Kganyago said the new notes did not create any additional costs. “We printed the same number of notes that we would have printed in a year, but just dedicated R400 million of those to the centenary series,” he said. The Reserve Bank would not compromise on the security features of bank notes. “We must ensure the buying power of the currency is protected. We strive to ensure the public trust in our bank notes and coins, as well as in the Reserve Bank, is maintained.”
