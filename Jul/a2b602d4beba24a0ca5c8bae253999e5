JACOB Modise loves his two sons as only a dad can. But the former truck driver doesn’t know what do to any more. He said his sons turned into monsters who steal things from his house. The 49-year-old man from Phase 7 kasi in Mangaung believes his sons are cursed. He said: “I used to be a truck driver while I was still with my wife. When she left me I lived with my two boys, whom I love very much. “These boys turned into monsters out of nowhere. I suddenly noticed things like phone chargers and my kettle going missing and when I asked, no one knew who stole them. “Now they must be stealing from other houses too as I noticed they have money, but are not working. “I survived a light stroke and I thought that they would change seeing that I nearly died and would stop their evil doings,” said Jacob. “But instead they continued. When I consulted a sangoma to help me, he warned me that they were possessed by an evil spirit and were being used. “But to help them, he told me I would have to buy two goats and pay R3 500 each. I don’t have that kind of money. “I love my boys very much and I really want help for them. The sangoma told me that if I didn’t get help for them soon they would die very painful deaths.” Sangoma Rakouane Mamoya told the People’s Paper: “These boys stole at a place they were not supposed to be and as a result, they don’t need a goat because a goat is for amathwasa. “They must be cleansed to take away the spell.”
