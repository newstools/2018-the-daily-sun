Former Mzansi president Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane Zuma, appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crime Court in Joburg on Monday. His case has been postponed to 24 January 2019. He arrived in court in ankle chains after being processed at the Joburg Central Police Station. Duduzane has has been charged with corruption and was granted R100 000 bail. The State did not oppose his bail application. He has agreed to hand in his passport to the authorities and was told to ask for permission if he wants to travel overseas. City Press reported that Duduzane was set to be charged with corruption – apparently in connection with the role he allegedly played in an incident where former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas has said there was an attempt to bribe him at the Guptas’ Saxonwold home in 2015. According to the newspaper, sources from the Hawks had revealed Duduzane would be charged with contravening the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act. Duduzane Zuma has apparently been overseas since February; however, his brother, Vusi Nhlakanipho Zuma, died recently of lupus and Duduzane came to attend his funeral. According to City Press, Duduzane Zuma was seen at the funeral service, held at Rhema Church in Randburg on Saturday. Previously, News24 reported that Duduzane Zuma was briefly detained at the OR Tambo International Airport after landing there on Thursday evening. After his identity was confirmed by Hawks officers, he was released. Furthermore, earlier this month, Duduzane Zuma received a summons to appear in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on July 12 on two charges of culpable homicide. The charges related to a car crash in February 2014 during which Duduzane Zuma rear-ended a taxi after losing control of his Porsche on the Grayston Drive off-ramp on the M1, north of Johannesburg. One woman died instantly and three others were injured.
