RICHARD Maneli (51) from Kuyasa in Khayelitsha, Cape Town started a welding business five years ago. “I was tired of hearing people complained about their houses being broken into. “I wanted to make burglar gates so they could feel safe,” he said. He works with his wife, Nosiphathise (50). “I am happy my wife is helping me. At the end of the day I am doing this for my family, which she is part of.” Nosiphathise said she does not see anything wrong with working with her husband. “I paint the gates after he welds them. “He is doing this to put food on the table for our family,” she said. They charge up to R5 500 for a sliding gate and as much as R2 000 for a small one. “Our prices are based on what our clients want. “We offer a high quality service. Anyone who decides to do business with us will not be sorry,” said Richard. “We are no longer living in an age where women wait for their husbands to get a job. “Couples must work hand in hand like us.”
