CHAOS erupted outside the community hall in KwaMashu L section, north of Durban, yesterday. Kasi businesspeople were demanding that foreign nationals close down their shops. Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala, mayor Zandile Gumede and Premier Willies Mchunu were meant to hand over 391 operating licences to Phoenix, KwaMashu, Ntuzuma and Inanda business owners. This would have followed a deal between government, locals and foreign nationals who run businesses in the kasis. The deal came about following talks between the parties and after letters were sent to foreigners, ordering them to close their shops. Despite this, local business owners still wanted the foreign nationals to leave the area yesterday. Their spokesman Mandla Sibaya said only local businessmen deserved to get licences. “We don’t want them to have licences,” Sibaya told Daily Sun. “We want them to go because they’re killing our businesses.” Sipho Kaunda, chairman of the eThekwini Municipality’s Economic Development Committee, said the handover was cancelled. “We can’t do anything in this situation,” said Kaunda, who was not pleased with the locals’ conduct. He said the licences would be handed over at a later stage.
