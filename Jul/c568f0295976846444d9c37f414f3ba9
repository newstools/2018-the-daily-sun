KHANYISILE Kweyama said she is not convinced her hijacking was about the car. The chairwoman of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa was hijacked in Houghton, Joburg on Thursday. She was on her way home when the incident happened. Kweyama was pepper-sprayed and put in the boot of her car before being driven around for at least three hours. Her car was later found abandoned in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. In an interview with the SABC, Kweyama said: “If it was a normal crime, you would at least expect them to try harder to get money out of me.” She said when she called her bank the following day, she was told there were three attempts to withdraw money from her account, but they were declined. “I have read of other instances where hijackers drag you along to withdraw money if they fail the first time. It’s strange they didn’t take the money. “Clearly it was not about the car because they didn’t take it either.” Ishmail Mnisi, the transport department spokesman, said Transport Minister Blade Nzimande condemned the incident. “It’s believed that this act of violence against the chairwoman is a scare tactic to defocus her from her enormous work and progress in turning around the agency.” Mnisi said the department was working with cops to ensure Kweyama’s safety and that of all board members and agency employees. Gauteng police spokeswoman Colonel Noxolo Kweza said: “We are investigating a case of hijacking and kidnapping.”
