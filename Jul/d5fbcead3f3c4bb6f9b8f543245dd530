VIOLENCE against women in Mzansi takes many forms. About 300 women taxi owners and widows gathered at the Rose Hall in the Bram Fischer building, Bloemfontein on Wednesday to address their problems. Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela called the gathering. She said she decided to act after a woman taxi owner unexpectedly visited her office and reported their painful problems. “These women tell me that their husbands left the taxi permits to them to run the businesses, but some taxi operators are enriching themselves with these permits,” said Ntombela. “They convert them to their names and other permits are missing.” The premier said these things left her shocked and hurt. “I called this gathering to give these women a platform to tell us what happened to their permits. “We have realised that they all face similar problems,” Ntombela said. “We need to deal with these evil deeds. Sam Mashinini, MEC for police, roads and transport and his team will investigate and ensure that the culprits are arrested,” said Ntombela. Mashinini said permits taken illegally by taxi thugs would be identified and returned to their rightful owners. He added that investigations would include officials who had assisted these shameless men. One of the victims, Dimakotso Sekhokho (61) from Ventersburg, said her late husband lent his close friend his permit when he was critically ill. “His friend took advantage and insisted on keeping it after my husband’s death. He then changed my husband’s name on the permit and converted it to his name. I want it back,” she said.
