The Beret is the ultimate trend this season and there is no better person who rocks them like the Queen of style, Bonang Matheba. Berets were worn in the olden days by our grandmothers and mothers and they have definitely made a comeback as most things have in fashion. The beret, pronounced as be-re-h, is a unisex accessory that can be worn by both men and women. This accessory makes a cool statement not just for warmth on a cold day or night but also to add a pop of color to spice up a boring outfit. Although the beret is an influential political accessory, it sure is a headwear of choice in today's fashion. Here are 5 times Queen B gave us Beret envy: 1.  ...a cold Wednesday in Jhb...??
