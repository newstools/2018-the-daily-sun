HELP is on the way for people who failed their matric exams. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga was in the Eastern Cape at the weekend to raise awareness about her department’s support programme. The programme was created for people who want to rewrite the national and extended senior certificate exams. On Sunday, Motshekga visited the Buffalo City district offices at Dr WB Rubusana College of Education, Mdantsane. She spoke to a large group of high school drop-outs. “We’re not creating a system that will run parallel to the mainstream one,” she said. “Instead, we’re creating an opportunity for everyone who missed their first one.” Motshekga told Daily Sun the initiative was a distance learning study programme. “You can access the learning material and study at your own pace before you register for exams,” she said. She said the programme was expected to help a number of people who couldn’t afford to go back to school.
