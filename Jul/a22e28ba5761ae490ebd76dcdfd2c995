A SOMALIAN businessman in KwaMancinza, north of Durban, fears for his life. Dan Daniels (36) said he is worried the robbery that took place at his shop on Wednesday could be the beginning of a fresh wave of xenophobic attacks. He said he was sleeping in the shop when he heard voices. “I woke my brother and asked him if he could hear the people who were outside the shop. Then we smelled smoke. “The men said we should open the shop otherwise they would burn it while we’re still inside,” he said. Dan said they opened the door and the men stormed in with guns. “We were terrified and thought they were going to kill us. “They told us to kneel and put our hands on our heads,” said the shop owner. Dan said the men took his airtime vending machine and some cigarettes before leaving. “Maybe their intention wasn’t to rob us. “Perhaps they were trying to tell us they don’t want us in this community. “It could be that local shop owners sent them to scare us so that we close the store and leave.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “We confirm the incident took place. “However, no case was opened by the complainant.” Dan said he was not aware he needed to open a case because police officers came to his shop after the robbery. He said: “I will open a case.”
