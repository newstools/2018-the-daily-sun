Fidelity Security guards have been attacked and robbed at a petrol station in Johannesburg on Tuesday afternoon, the company has confirmed. The number of guards involved is still unclear. "It was just a cross pavement [cash carrier] and it was not the cash van that was robbed. As they picked up money from inside of the [petrol station] store, the security guard was held up at gunpoint," Fidelity CEO Wahl Bartmann told News24. Bartmann said the incident took place at a Total garage in Douglasdale, Fourways. He said the robbers made off with a canister but added that "there was not big cash lost there". According to him, Fidelity's task team and police later arrested two people and recovered two canisters in Diepsloot. A firearm was also recovered, he said. The guards were not injured. Police could not immediately comment on the incident. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/watch-cash-in-transit-guards-attacked-at-joburg-petrol-station-20180717
