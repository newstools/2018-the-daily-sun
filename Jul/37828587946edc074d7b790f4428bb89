ANGLO Platinum Mine has been operating in Mogalakwena, Mapela Village outside Mokopane, Limpopo for a year. But local business owners aren’t happy. They said they aren’t getting any opportunities from the mine as part of the programme supposed to empower local businesses. They accused mine management of giving first preference to outside companies. Speaking at their meeting last Monday, Mapela Local Businesses Association chairman Makinta Masenya said: “When we started our association in May, we realised the mine was just here for profit and not to benefit local people. “It is not putting into practice its programme but as local business people, we aren’t backing down. “We will fight until we are considered as well. “If you go to other Anglo operations, the lives of the local people have been improved. “What about us here?” he asked. Masenya told members: “We must join hands and focus on the bigger picture. “Once our companies are guaranteed jobs at the mine, you will have to create jobs for unemployed locals who will be working under you,” he said. Association secretary Godfrey Legong said they have met continuously with mine management to demand that the transformation programme is put in place. “We also report back to our members after every meeting, so they are well informed of the progress we are making.” Mine spokeswoman Mpumi Sithole said the business forum was started less than three months ago, when the mine started discussions with representatives but people expected things to happen instantly. “As part of our standard processes, we require founding documents and a constitution or the association’s terms of reference to understand which local businesses it represents.” “Following the submission of founding documents, we will then request a full database of members who run businesses in Mapela. “This is to ensure the businesses form part of the pool used in the supply chain as part of the implementation of our community empowerment model,” she said.
