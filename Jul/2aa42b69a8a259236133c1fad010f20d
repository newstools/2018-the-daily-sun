IT’S BEEN five months since her only son was buried, but Laura Francis is struggling to accept her son’s death. The distraught mother (58) told Daily Sun that not knowing what killed her healthy son keeps her up all night. Laura Francis from Sakhile in Standerton, Mpumalanga said she cries every day. She said her 27-year-old son, Sheldon Francis, was allegedly poisoned but no one wants to speak up. “The day my son died in March, I had tried to call him several times in vain. “The calls sounded like he was hanging up. “He was supposed to organised transport for me as I had to attend an event in Gauteng that Saturday. But when I saw the police parking at my gate, I knew something was wrong. “The police told me we had to go to a local tavern to identify him.” She said when they arrived at the tavern, her son was lying on the floor. What surprised her was that no one knew what had happened to him. “When I went to the same tavern the next day to find out what had happened, the owner said he heard Sheldon complaining of a headache.” She said her son-in-law had also tried to investigate and asked for camera footage but the owner said it wasn’t working. “It’s scary because I don’t know if his killers will come back for me. What worries me most is that it looks as if the police are not doing enough to get to the root of this case. To make things worse, I’m told I might have to wait 10 years before I get the post mortem results,” she said. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said an inquest docket was opened. He said the reason there were delays in the investigation was that some intestine had to be sent for tests. He said investigations would continue when the toxicology results were returned.
