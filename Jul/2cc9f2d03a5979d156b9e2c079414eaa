THE case of a man accused of killing and burning his ex-girlfriend has been postponed for a bail application. Siviwe Khusani (26) allegedly murdered Azintle Feni (25) of Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, last month. Khusani appeared briefly in the Motherwell Magistrates Court on Friday on a charge of murder. His case was postponed to Thursday. Wearing a green hoodie and blue jeans, he stood quietly in the dock. He told the court he wanted to apply for bail.  The State said itwould oppose bail. Azintle was reported missing on 25 June after attending a 16 June Youth Day party. She was last seen in the company of Khusani. Police followed up on leads and found Khusani in a house with a blue Mazda parked in the yard. They found traces of blood in the vehicle. At another house in Kamvelihle, where he regularly used a room, bloodstains were found on the bed. He then took police into the bushes nearby, where they found Azintleâ€™s burned body. There was a burned tyre close to the body.
