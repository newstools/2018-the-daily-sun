ON TUESDAY, there was high drama at Richmond Municipality. Suspended municipal manager Bongiwe Mnikathi was dragged screaming from the building. Mnikathi was suspended on Monday during a municipal council meeting. Furious, she said she would take the municipality to court for suspending her without a chance to state her case. Sources said on Tuesday there was chaos at the municipal offices when Mnikathi tried to get into her office and remove documents. “Guards stopped her, saying she was not allowed to set foot in the offices as she was suspended. “Mnikathi screamed and tried to force her way in but the guards managed to prevent her,” they said. Apparently she is being accused of fraud and corruption. “She was accused of leading the pack in corruption. That’s why the council suspended her,” the sources said. Mnikathi told Daily Sun she would take the legal route. “I don’t remember being formally charged for the allegations. I was suspended without being given a chance to present my side.” She said she went to her office on Tuesday to fetch her belongings. “I was treated like a criminal.” Municipal communications officer Sibonelo Bhengu said: “Mnikathi was suspended and stopped from entering the office. It is being investigated.”
