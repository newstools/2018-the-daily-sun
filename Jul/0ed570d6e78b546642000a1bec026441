THE water crisis in Nelson Mandela Bay is hitting local farmers hard. At least six cows have died from thirst and hunger. Mjoli Mzomba, the Masithembane Farmers’ Co-operative chairman, said: “There’s no grass for goats and cows because of the drought.” He said dams where cows used to drink water have all dried up. “The drought has already killed six cows belonging to our members,” he said. “This a big blow. Farming, our source of income, has become a headache.” Andile Ntanga (47) has been farming for three years. And like many emerging farmers in Motherwell, he’s struggling to feed his animals. “If the municipality installs communal water taps close to pig shelters, we could use containers to fetch water for the pigs,” he said. “They’ve only given us water tanks, which are now empty. “We have to walk a kilometre to get water. And now that people are being moved, the municipality will definitely close communal taps as there won’t be shacks any more where we get water.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “Farmers have been informed by the urban agriculture subdirectorate they need to follow an application process to receive water.” He said they could get the application forms from the subdirectorate. Mniki told Daily Sun those who followed this process would be helped.
