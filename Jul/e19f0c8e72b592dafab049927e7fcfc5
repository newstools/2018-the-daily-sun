The 67 Logos that culminated on Mandela Day, saw 67 businesses each receive a logo, a mini-brand identity, a two-day business boot camp training programme, a registered web domain and free web hosting for 67 weeks, valued at R 40 000 per company – all at no costs to the SMEs. “We believe that the full package we managed to give to the 67 participating SMEs will make a real bottom line impact on these small businesses.  Too often we rely on government and big corporates to do all the work in supporting SMEs. This initiative sees successful entrepreneurs who have managed to sustain their business giving back – in the spirit of Mandela – to startup SMEs. If all these businesses survive and grow it will translate into hundreds of people being employed and families gaining breadwinners” said Samantha Gabriel, Group MD of Designers Ink, at the event in Johannesburg. Nelson Mandela believed in making a positive change in the world – using your actions to have a strong and lasting impact! This is what inspired Colourworks and Designers Ink to spearhead the 67 Logos project. This is an initiative that saw designers and established businesses assisting up and coming SMEs in fast tracking their businesses. SMEs were called upon to register for selection and 67 SMEs were chosen to receive a uniquely crafted logo and brand collateral – as well as additional business services. The 67 designers onboard met with the SMEs for brainstorming at the end of June.  Presentations and the handover of the logos happened on 18 July: Nelson Mandela Day. This is intended as a sustainable initiative and will be held annually going forward from this inaugural event.
