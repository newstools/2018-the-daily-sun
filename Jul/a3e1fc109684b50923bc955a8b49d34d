THE start of the 2018-19 Absa Premiership is just around the corner and teams have been hustling in the transfer market trying to strengthen their squads before the 31 August deadline. Some big names have changed clubs and will be donning new colours this season. Defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns made their move early when they secured the services of Andile Jali from Belgian outfit KV Oostende last month, beating Soweto giants Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs to his signature. The Brazilians are chasing after the services of former Cape Town City FC midfielder Lyle Lakay too and are also believed to be eyeing Maritzburg Unitedâ€™s young midfield ace Siphesihle Ndlovu. Ndlovu impressed last season and was voted both PSL Young Player of the Season and Midfielder of the Season. Chiefs on the other hand have secured arguably the signing of the season so far in Khama Billiat, who joined the Glamour Boys from Sundowns on a free transfer a few weeks later. Chiefs will be on high alert after their long term target Lebogang Manyama was released by his Turkish club Konyaspor, but his manager Maimane Phiri said they were still looking at overseas clubs. Meanwhile, Orlando Pirates also made their intentions clear when they announced nine signings last month, the standout being goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo who came directly from their arch rivals, Chiefs. Some of the smaller teams have also been busy in the market. Polokwane City announced seven new signings, among them former Maritzburg United and Free State Stars striker Mohammed Anas. Under the guidance of Slovakian Jozef Vukusic, Rise and Shine will be hoping to improve on their 12th place finish in the top flight last season.
