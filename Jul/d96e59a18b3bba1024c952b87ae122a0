 THE Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) and the
Democratic Alliance will march in Pretoria demanding for the fuel levy to be
reduced. They will hand over a memorandum Treasury, calling
for a reduction of R1 in the general fuel levy and an independent inquiry into
the Road Accident Fund (RAF). OUTA said while government shifts the blame,
suggesting that high fuel prices are due only to external factors like the oil
price and the rand/dollar exchange, they have shown that the fuel price can be
significantly reduced by adjusting the general fuel levy. “This is within government’s control and simply
requires their will to make this possible.” “Our memorandum also calls for an investigation of
the RAF which receives a portion (R1.93) paid to the fuel levy and R 3.37 goes
to the fiscus,” OUTA said. According to the organisation, the RAF has been
marred with fruitless and wasteful expenditure and an independent investigation
will ensure that these funds will no longer go to waste. "Government must also know that they cannot
continue to blame these fuel price increases on 'international markets' as 33%
of our fuel price is made up of two levies: the general fuel levy and the Road
Accident Fund levy," Maimane said.
