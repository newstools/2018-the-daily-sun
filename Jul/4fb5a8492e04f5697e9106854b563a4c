RESIDENTS of Zwelihle kasi in Hermanus last Tuesday night took down a fence which they said reminded them of the apartheid era. Community leader and Zwelihle Renewal chairman Sicelo Gxamesi said: “We can’t allow things that happened during apartheid to happen now.” A resident told Daily Sun: “Why are we being separated in the first place? We’re all the same? “No one is better than the other. That’s why we took it down.” Another resident, though, couldn’t understand why the fence was taken down. “In my own understanding, the fence was put up to protect kids in the park,” said the resident.” “Now anyone can go there and do as they wish. She said kids could potentially fall victim to thugs. “They will understand the purpose of the fence when something bad happens to kids who play there.” MPL Masizole Mnqasela said the fence wasn’t there to separate blacks and whites. “The fence was put up to protect kids who play in the park. Some play soccer and the ball might go into the road,” said Mnqasela. He insisted that the fence was put up to ensure kids’ safety. “Now anyone can enter because the place isn’t fenced, and innocent kids will pay for it,” he said. Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said 42 people were arrested on charges of public violence since last Wednesday.
