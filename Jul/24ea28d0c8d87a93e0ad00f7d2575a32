GOGO Qiqi Nkosi said her sister’s spirit won’t rest in peace until she finds her niece, Mabeni Shabangu, who went missing in 1997. The 84-year-old from Ludlow in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga said Mabeni left home to work in Gauteng and never returned home. The gogo told Daily Sun the trouble started when her sister Khabonina, who died in 1999, came into her dreams asking her to take care of her kids Mabeni, Butini, Khukile, Esther and Boy. But Mabeni, who is the eldest, was nowhere to be found. She said her niece moved with her mlungu boss from Matsafeni outside Mbombela to Pretoria and Marble Hall to work on his farm. “Since 1997, she has never made contact with her family and now her mum’s spirit is haunting me.” Qiqi said she heard Mabeni is living near Kwaggafontein on a farm. “Her dead mum comes into my dreams, asking me where she is. “We tried to trace her whereabouts but were unsuccessful. “Her mum was buried without her. I am the only surviving elder in the family and am begging Mabeni, or whoever has information of her whereabouts, to call us. I want her mum’s spirit to rest in peace.” Gogo said anyone with information can call her on 076 4789 236.
