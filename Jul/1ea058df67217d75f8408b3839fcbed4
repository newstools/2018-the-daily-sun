KZN COPS have hunted down four people wanted in connection with kidnapping. On Monday, the men aged 37 – 59, including a 44-year-old foreigner, were bust in Mandeni. Their victim managed to escape from the house in Mandeni, north of Durban where he was being kept. This was about 130km from where he was kidnapped in Westcliff, Chatsworth. Two of the men allegedly abducted their foreign victim on Friday, saying they would keep him hostage until his relatives transferred money to them. The suspects apparently grabbed the man in Westcliff and shoved him into their car before speeding off. Cops were alerted and the search began. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the hostage negotiator unit was called and together with the special task force and national intervention units, traced the suspects to Mandeni. She said the other two suspects were bust in KwaDukuza after police stopped a suspicious-looking car. Gwala said the victim had already asked his brother in Uganda to deposit US$1 000 (about R13 720) in one of the suspects’ accounts. She said the victim was kept in the house in Mandeni but managed to escape on Sunday. “The suspects have been charged with kidnapping and will appear in Chatsworth Magistrates Court soon. “The money the victim said was deposited by his brother will form part of the investigation.”
