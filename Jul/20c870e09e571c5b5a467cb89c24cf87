A MAN who made a living selling cat meat to unsuspecting samoosa
vendors and a hotel for six years said he did so because he had “identified a
gap in the market”. According to Daily
Nation, James Mukangu Kimani was sentenced on Tuesday by Justice Joel Ngugi
for skinning a cat in Nakuru, a town in western Kenya. In fact, Kimani later confessed to journalists that he
sold the meat of more than 1 000 cats that he killed and skinned. On 24 June, Kimani was charged with slaughtering and
selling cat meat to unsuspecting customers for humans to eat. He was also charged with slaughtering an animal in an
undesignated place contrary to meat control regulations. The judge reduced the sentence that Kimani was originally
given by a magistrate. Instead of serving three years in jail, Kimani will now serve
two. His fine has also been reduced from Sh50 000 (about R6
640) to Sh10 000 (about R1 330).
