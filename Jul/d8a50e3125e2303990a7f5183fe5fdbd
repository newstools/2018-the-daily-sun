One of the biggest house music producers in Mzansi, Culoe de Song, has paid homage to his biggest inspirations. Taking to Instagram in a #TBT post, Culoe took some time to remind all of us to let people know that we appreciate them while they’re still alive. “Some have left us for the other side, some continue to inspire and serve the world with their gifts. People never get their flowers while they can still smell them, let’s give thanks to those that helped us get them,” he said in the post. He went on to say that through persistence, faith and perseverance, things have aligned in such a way that he was able to work with the people who once inspired him. “I’ve been blessed to have met and continued to be surrounded by people who conquered their dreams against all odds! The love and inspiration I’ve gained in my journey is beyond me and I’m humbled by all of it,” he said. His post comes amid the centenary celebrations of the late icon, Nelson Mandela whose life inspired so many that even in death, he continues to receive praise. It’s crazy how things align themselves through persistence, faith and perseverance! I’ve been blessed to have met and continued to be surrounded by people who conquered their dreams against all odds! The love and inspiration I’ve gained in my journey is beyond me and I’m humbled by all of it! Some have left us for the other side, some continue to inspire and serve the world with their gifts. People never get their flowers while they can still smell them, let’s give thanks to those that helped us get them!!!
