The community of Mphambo village outside Malamulele went on rampage after a cop shot
and killed a member of the community. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said it
alleged that in the evening of Saturday the deceased Dennis Hlungwani, aged 37, of Mphambo village was shot several times throughout the body by a Warrant Officer attached to the Giyani Public
Order Police who then ran away and disappeared. He said the motive behind this incident is not clear at
this stage but the ongoing investigations by the Police and IPID will tell. Ngoepe said subsequent to this shooting, members of the
community started mobilising themselves and attacked the officers who reacted
to this scene. One Police Captain was seriously injured and six Police
motor vehicles were damaged by the angry mob. The police in Malamulele have since opened cases of
murder and malicious damage to property. Ngoepe said the Warrant Officer  involved in this murder incident has since
been arrested. The suspects who went on the rampage, assaulting a police
officer and damaging state properties are still being sought. The investigations are still continuing. The Saps Provincial Commissioner in Limpopo, Lieutenant
General Nneke Ledwaba has condemned acts of mob-attacks and vigilantism which
are still prevalent in some area in the 
Province especially in the Giyani Cluster "Community members are warned and cautioned to
refrain and stop taking the law into their own hands as this practice continues
to destroy the spirit of Community Policing", said Ledwaba Anyone with information which can lead to the arrest of
