A DISGRACED ANC councillor hung his head in shame at the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrates Court yesterday. Sipho Maselane (34) was found guilty on four counts of rape and five counts of robbery with aggravated circumstances. The ward 19 councillor from Winterveld, north of Tshwane, and his accomplice were arrested in 2015 for raping and robbing two women in 2014 and another two in 2015. Two of the victims were in their 30s while the other two were 14- year-old teenagers. Magistrate Daniel Mogotsi found the pair guilty on all nine counts. Maselane had pleaded not guilty. Mogotsi said the state proved beyond reasonable doubt that Maselane’s statement was not true. “Even if I didn’t look at the DNA evidence, I find there is overwhelming evidence in counts one to eight and I return the verdict of guilty,” he said. After sentencing, the state made an application for Maselane to remain in custody until the matter was finalised. He was kept in custody until his sentencing.
