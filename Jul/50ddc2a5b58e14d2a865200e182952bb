THE Sibasa Traffic Station is still closed after being hit by robbers a week ago. It’s not known when the station in Thulamela, in the Vhembe district of Limpopo, will open again. The robbers apparently attacked in the early hours of last Wednesday. People who visited the station the following day went home disappointed after finding it closed. The most affected were those who had booked for driver’s licence tests and vehicle licence renewals. One of them is Evans Mudau (55), a truck owner who sells sand. “On Monday, I was there to renew my licence but the queue was long and I had clients waiting for orders. On Tuesday, I arrived early but the office was closed.” He said his licence has expired and if he gets bust, cops won’t listen to his story. Ndwamato Tshiila, Thulamela Municipality’s spokesman, confirmed the robbery. He said the offices will remain closed for now. “Cops, the department of transport and our municipality are conducting investigations. We advise people to use alternative stations.” Tshiila said clients who missed their bookings will be given new dates. Lieutenant-Colonel Mashudu Malelo, Thohoyandou police spokesman, said three security guards were attacked by three armed suspects who came into the guardroom and ordered them to lie down before handcuffing them. According to Malelo, the robbers also took two Norinco pistols from the guards, each of which was loaded with six rounds. The sound of grinders was allegedly heard from the offices before the robbers drove off. About R60 000 was taken. Two security guards were left injured after being assaulted. “The suspects are not known but police investigations are underway,” he said.
