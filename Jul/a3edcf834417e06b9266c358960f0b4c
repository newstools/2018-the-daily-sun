Renowned TV television presenter, Claire Mawisa has weighed in on AKA’s most recent rant. As we’re so used to by now, AKA took to Twitter to go off on another one of his rants. This time, about Instagram. Seriously, does he not get enough attention? Anyway, the rapper went off this week about how Instagram has built up a culture of people going online and aspiring to live the lives of people who pretend to have it all. According to him, most of the people who show off their flashy lives consisting of luxurious holidays, food and material possessions, are not even living that life in reality. He went so far as to say that the “explore page” (where Instagram shows you all the accounts that it recommends you follow) is “pure poison”. In conclusion, he wants to quit Instagram. He hasn’t done it as yet, but ok. Now, the conversation has shifted over to Claire’s timeline after she responded to AKA’s claims. “It's not instagram. It’s you,” she said, sparking a whole new debate. She tried to defend herself when several trolls (probably from the Megacy) dragged her for her comment. “Where does the content come from? Who loads the pictures? Who's showing off possessions in an attempt to appear "more than"? Mxmn. a platform is nothing without users. Think,” she responded when a user tried to blame the platform and not the people.
