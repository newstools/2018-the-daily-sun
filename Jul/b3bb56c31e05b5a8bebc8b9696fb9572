THESE two women from Komani in Eastern Cape want to make a positive impact on the lives of young people. Last year, they started Avenir Media House to run a magazine that covers the challenges and inspirations of the youth. Co-founder Babalwa Magqwanti (24) said the publication is named Avenir, which means future, which is what they want for the province’s youth. Their publication is being funded from their own pockets and they are currently working on their third issue. Babalwa, who first studied towards a journalism diploma at Nelson Mandela University, later graduated with a BA in media, communications and culture. She and her partner Zenande Mankayi (28) both worked at Lukhanji Community Radio as newsreaders. Babalwa said they planned on having an online and print media, communication, advertising, events and information business. “The first successful branch was print media, advertising and events,” she said. The content of their magazine centres around youth development and information sharing. “We cover stories of young people in the province, whether they’re in business, sport, arts, or any other career,” she said. “We also share information about bursaries, tertiary institutions and vacancies. “Our province has a lot of heritage and history, so we profile struggle heroes from this area.” Zenande said: “Our aim is to empower and expose young people doing great things, as well as to create awareness about the province. We want youth to learn to be consistent in whatever they go into and not to give up. “We also call on local businesses to support and help us.” They plan on having their own operating space and satellite offices and want young people to use it as an information centre.
