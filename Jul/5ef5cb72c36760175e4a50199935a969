  Umtiti breaks Belgium hearts as France secure World Cup final spot! France are through to the final of the 2018 Soccer World Cup after beating Belgium 1-0 in their semi-final clash at the Krestovsky Stadium in St Petersburg. Belgium started the far better side, dominating possession and looking for a way through the French defence.As the first half wore on, France came more into the game and both sides had a few half chances that they could not take advantage of as they headed into half-time locked at 0-0.In the beginning of the second half France had an excellent chance when Olivier Giroud turned Vincent Kompany and unleashed a shot on goal in the 50th minute.Kompany did brilliantly to recover and managed just to get a block in for the ball to ricochet away for a corner.It was from that set piece that France took a 1-0 lead with towering centre-back, Samuel Umtiti rising to head home as he lost his marker to put France in the ascendancy.Belgium brought on Dries Mertens soon after and he immediately started supplying pinpoint crosses from out on the right.It was from one of these that Marouane Fellaini spurned a glorious chance by heading wide in the 64th minute. France were happy to sit back and absorb the pressure as Belgium launched attack after attack.They could not find the equaliser, however, and France, the 1998 winners, booked their place in Sunday's final where they will face either England or Croatia. - Sport24
