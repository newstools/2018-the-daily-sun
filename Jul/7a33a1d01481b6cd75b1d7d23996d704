THE muthi smear trick is one of the oldest in the book, but people are still getting caught out. And even though the gang behind the money grabbing trick was caught, Nompumelelo Nkosi still didn’t get her money back. The 25-year-old from Newlands West, north of Durban, told Daily Sun she was conned on Wednesday at the KwaMashu Shopping Centre, where she had gone to withdraw money from an ATM. “I’d just finished withdrawing money when a man bumped into me and touched me with some black muthi,” said Nompumelelo. “As I watched him walking away, a woman came and told me I should come with her because the man’s muthi would cause all my money to disappear.” She said the woman took her to a car, where a man and another woman prayed for her. “They asked me to close my eyes. When they were finished I got out of the car and walked to the taxi rank,” she said. “I was at the taxi rank when I realised my money and cellphone were gone.” She said she panicked and went to a guard and told him what had happened. “He gave me his cellphone to contact my dad and gave me taxi fare,” she said. She had just arrived home when the guard called her dad to say a gang had been caught after robbing a woman. “I went back with my sister and recognised them as the same people who had robbed me,” she said. “They were caught after a woman they tried to rob screamed for help. They tried to escape but guards caught them and called the cops.” She didn’t open a case.
