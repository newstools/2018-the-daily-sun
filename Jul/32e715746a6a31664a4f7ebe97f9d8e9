An Mpumalanga 38-year-old taxi
boss, Isaac Sello Letsoalo was shot and killed. Letsoalo was allegedly killed
while in his car along a public road at Pankop, Mmametlhake, near KwaMhlanga. According to Brigadier Leonard
Hlathi Letsoalo’s body was discovered by police members who were conducting
patrol duties around the area, when they noticed a white Volkswagen Polo Vivo
with GP registration parked next to the road. “They then stopped to search it.
It was during the search process that they found a man on a sitting position
next to the open driver’s door outside the vehicle, profusely bleeding from the
face,” Hlathi said. Hlathi said the victim had
sustained multiple bullet wounds somewhere on the upper body but was still
breathing. He was however, certified dead by
paramedics when they arrived at the scene. Hlathi added that further
investigations revealed that an unknown white sedan came and stopped next to
the victim's vehicle and opened fire before making a U-turn and fled the scene. The motive for the murder is
currently unknown but police are not ruling out the possibility of it being
related to an ongoing taxi feud in the area. Hlathi urged anyone with
information that may assist in the investigation, to contact Captain Jan
Phofele at 079 499 5244 or the SAPS Crime Stop number, 08600 10111.
