AMAJIMBOS will need to win the Cosafa Cup at all cost if they are to qualify for Under-17 Africa Cup of Nations scheduled for May next year in Tanzania. The Mzansi youngsters face hosts Mauritius in the Cosafa semifinal today (1pm) at Stade St Francois Xavier, with the final set for Sunday. South Africa Under-20 coach Thabo Senong knows the size of task ahead of the Under-17 players as his side showed persistence to seal their place in the Afcon finals. SA’s Men’s U-20, Women’s Under-17 and senior women’s team Banyana Banyana have all qualified for their upcoming major tournaments. Now it remains to be seen if Amajimbos will also be able to emulate them which will be a huge task for them as they need to win the competition in order to qualify for Afcon that also serves as a qualifier for the Fifa Under-17 World Cup in Peru later next year. In celebration of the national teams qualifications for different international tournaments that took place at Safa house yesterday, Senong wished Amajimbos well on their journey. He said: “I can start by saying well done for coming out of their group. It won’t be easy but they need to understand that they are the pride of the nation and must respect the badge.” Safa president Danny Jordaan was also impressed with the success of the junior teams. Jordaan said: “In 2014 after the Brazil World Cup we started vision 2022. In the first phase we said we want to build a sustainable success for Bafana Bafana. “One of the things was not to wish for success at senior level when we have no success at the junior level. For the first time you can see from 2014 to 2018 all our junior teams had success qualifying for Afcon, Under-17 (men and women) and U-20s qualifying for the World Cup.”
