IN THE early hours of Tuesday morning, gogo Johanna was woken by a bad dream. Although she does not remember what happened in the dream, it saved her life because she then woke to find her house on fire! Gogo Johanna Matlala (89) from Eersterust, Tshwane, said after she realised the house she had lived in for 52 years was engulfed in flames, she took cover and screamed for help. “I rushed outside and I could not believe my eyes when I saw an electrical pole burning next to my house,” she said. Gogo Johanna said she suspected that the fire started in the prepaid meter box in her bedroom. Although the gogo’s neighbours came to the rescue, she lost her favourite furniture and the house was seriously damaged. Councillor Benjamin Lawrence visited gogo Johanna on Tuesday morning. “She is our mother and has played a huge role in the community,” he said. Tshwane social development MMC Ntsiki Mokhothu spent the whole of Tuesday with the gogo and promised to make sure her house was repaired. Mokhothu said social workers assessed the damage and prepared a report.
