Local TV star and rapper, Sipho ‘Psyfo’ Ngwenya and his girlfriend Aamirah are living it up in the USA. The couple has been there for a couple of days now to celebrate Psyfo’s 35th birthday party. The trip has also given him some time to reflect on his career and how well he has done for himself in life. “I think I have done well. Thank you to many years,” he shared on Instagram. Some of the couple’s stops in the USA include Atlanta, Fayetteville and Senoia in Georgia, New York City, as well as the Oculus at the World Trade Center where they did some shopping.
