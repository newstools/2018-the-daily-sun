LEBO Makara has taken rubbish and turned it into something beautiful. The 25-year-old from Bochabela kasi in Mangaung, Free State has used empty plastic bottles and wire to build a strong fence. He said his plan to build the fence started last year when he didn’t have enough money to build one. Lebo said when he was six years, he used to make cars out of wire and old tins. He said his mum used to shout at him because he brought so much rubbish home. “I collected bottles on the streets and cut them out to make the fence. “It took only a week to finish it,” said Lebo. “When people see the fence, they ask me how I did it. God has given me a talent and I must use it.” Lebo said he collects bottles and uses them to create useful items. “I am a man of many talents. I also repair bicycles, stoves and TVs,” he said. Lebo said dropped out of school in grade 11 because of financial problems at home. “But I now survive by using my hands. Everybody has a talent but some people don’t want to use it,” he said. “Crime is high in my kasi and I believe we should teach the youth to craft things to change their lives.”
