MOST of the villages in and around in the North West province, also known in Setswana as Bokone Bophirima, are experiencing severe water shortages. The taps are dry and some villagers have not had running water for several years. But the Rustenburg Municipality is fighting back. The municipality recently launched a three-year water conservation management programme called Metsi a Rona. Municipal manager Nqobile Sithole said this was an effort by the municipality to involve itself, businesses and the people of Rustenburg. “We aim to collectively save water for the long-term sustainability of the city and its people. “This will be done through a rapid response team equipped with resources and skills to attend to detection and reports of water leaks throughout the municipal area. “The obligation to preserve and use water wisely lies with all of us,” she said. Sithole added that in the last financial year, the municipality experienced a concerning 43% loss in water from leaks and general wasteful use. “We also had legacy water infrastructure and systems which made it difficult for us to prevent this loss. “There was also a gap in the way our people understood by-laws that govern water usage and preservation.” The municipality will upgrade its infrastructure and roll out modern technology strategies to manage reservoirs and prevent overflows. Mayor Mpho Khunou told Daily Sun: “It’s important that we take collective responsibility for a stable water supply that is sufficient to sustain the municipality in its entirety.”
