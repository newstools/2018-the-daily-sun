ZUKISWA Songca is passionate about poetry. The 48-year-old Xhosa teacher at Ndyebo High School, Motherwell was excited after performing at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival last week. “I recited a poem called Inde Indlela. “The poem is about the late Nelson Mandela. “I spoke about Madiba’s life as a young people, his education, the struggles he faced as a politician and the time he spent on Robben Island,” said Zukiswa. “I even praised Madiba for helping to bring peace and prosperity, not only for South Africans, but the world too. “If it wasn’t for Tata’s sacrifices, we wouldn’t be enjoying this freedom.” Zukiswa and 35 artists from the Eastern Cape will record a poetry video which will be released soon. “I started writing and reciting poems in 2008. Poetry helped me to express my grief during the funerals of relatives,” she said. “It also helped to console the remaining family members.” Zukiswa is a member of Vundu Poetry Club in her area. “The aim of our club is to introduce poetry to the youth and make it effective at schools,” she said. “We help kids to write and perform poetry in the classroom, as well as at school and community functions. We also teach kids about the importance of good morals.”
