LIFE is hard for Sibongile Nkosi and her family. The 45-year-old and her family of nine from Carolina, Mpumalanga live in a crumbling three-roomed house. “Our house is in a bad condition. “It may fall in on us at any time,” she told Daily Sun. “You can imagine how difficult it is to sleep on the floor in this cold weather.” Sibongile said she applied for an RDP more than five years ago, but the municipality had done nothing about her situation. “Officials from Chief Albert Luthuli Municipality came to assess our situation but nothing has been done. “When it’s raining, the roof leaks and we don’t even have a proper kitchen because we are forced to use all the rooms as bedrooms. “My kids and grandchildren are suffering. “I only earn R600 per month from the extended public works programme. “The money is too little to buy food for the whole family. “I can’t even afford to build my family a house.” David Nhlabathi, a spokesman for the municipality, said the municipality didn’t allocate houses and it was the human settlements department’s responsibility. "Applicants should understand that preference is given to orphans, the elderly and people living with disabilities,” Nhlabathi said. Freddy Ngobe, a spokesman for human settlements, said Sibongile was not on their housing subsidy database. “She should speak to her councillor to help her apply for a government subsidised house at the municipal offices,” Ngobe told the People’s Paper. “As a department, we would like to emphasise that our policy favours vulnerable groups.”
