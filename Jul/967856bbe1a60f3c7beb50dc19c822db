PERCY Tau could find himself in trouble for his “no-show” at training. The Mamelodi Sundowns star potentially faces a charge of absconding after missing a second day of training yesterday. Tau was expected back in Chloorkop on Tuesday but was nowhere to be seen as Downs started preparation for their trip to Botswana for a friendly against Township Rollers this weekend. It is now a known fact Tau has been trying to force a transfer after he attracted interest from English Premiership side, Brighton & Hove Albion. Sundowns are apparently holding out for a better deal for their prized asset and are not keen to accept Brighton’s offer, rumoured to be R45 million.The club would not be drawn on the steps to be taken against the midfield wizard. But sources have informed SunSport that Tau is already in trouble with the club and will be fined for his no-show.Coach Pitso Mosimane has said he will not stand in the way of the 24-year-old if he wants to further his career overseas.The stay-away tactic has become increasingly more common among local players.And for Sundowns, it’s an all-too-familiar ploy, previously used by the likes of Siboniso Gaxa and Katlego Mphela as relations between them and the club management broke down.Meanwhile, Brighton are said to have made Sundowns a final offer as the possible Tau transfer balances on a knife edge.“It’s going to be difficult for us to keep Tau. I think he must go. Let’s have a player in the EPL, we have nobody there now. He has done well for us, what else can he do for us?” said Mosimane.“Let’s see him week in and week out. I think we want to know if he’s the real deal or not, so let him go.”It remains to be seen whether Tau can wiggle out of his tight contract with this tactic. His manager, Mmatsatsi Sefalafala, refused to comment.
