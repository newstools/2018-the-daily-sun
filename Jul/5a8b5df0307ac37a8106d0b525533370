EXCITEMENT was painted on the faces of the students who attended induction classes at iCollege. They had been selected as the recipients of a scholarship programme. Thembeka Yende (19) of Driefontein in Mpumalanga, speaking at the college’s Joburg campus, said she was happy to be one of the students who received the scholarship. “I come from a mud house, living in fear of it collapsing over my head, but I didn’t let that stop me,” she said. “I matriculated in 2016. Although I managed to get funding, no university would accept me.” She said she was introduced to Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng’s church and the prophet helped her with registration and accommodation. Thembeka said she will work hard to make her dreams come true. “I want to finish my studies so I can go home and build my family a house they can be proud of,” she said. Thabisile Yende (30), Thembeka’s sister said they were raised by a single, unemployed parent. “Our mother did everything in her power but it was not enough. We’ve faced difficulties as a family. My sister battled to get funding to further her studies. “I had already given up hope but thanks to Prophet Mboro and iCollege, my sister can now fulfil her dream,” she said.
