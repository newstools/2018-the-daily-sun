Triple Platinum selling artist Nathi Mankayi is set to release his third studio album titled Iphupha Labantu. All roads led to The Empire in Joburg on Wednesday for the launch where the Nomvula star gave the lucky guests a taste of his new project. Among the guests were fellow label mates Thami Shobede and Wandile Mbambeni, actress Nambitha Mpumlwana, musicians Siphokazi, Tressor, Zandile Khumalo, Arthur Mafokate, and Mjakes the Producer. The Afro Soul crooner performed all his new songs alongside a band and his wife Mpho. Iphupha Labantu is Nathi’s first album under his new label Gallo Record Company after leaving Muthaland Entertainment. While the album is also about love, a concept that is not new in Nathi’s work, Iphupha Labantu has a happy mood about it and sees Nathi showcase his spirituality a lot more. “If you listen carefully to the album, you will understand that it is a happy album,” said Nathi’s manager China Mpololo. “That is because he is in a happy space at the moment; he chose these songs purely because the country is on fire and he wants to remind people that love prevails, despite all the bad.”
