IN MDANTSANE CC18 squatter camp, East London, 125 families have to share only four communal toilets. Each toilet has been allocated to 31 families but when residents have visitors or there are funerals and traditional functions, the situation is desperate. Residents told Daily Sun after Buffalo City Municipality moved them from their shacks to make way for RDP houses in 2016, they promised the situation would be temporary. They said they were told they would be moved to RDPs within five months. Community leader Ncumisa Lingane said most people relieved themselves in the bushes as the toilets were far from their shacks and only three families had the keys. “We’ve been begging the municipality for help through our councillor with no luck.” A 68-year-old gogo on crutches said she would rather risk being bitten by a snake than walk to the toilets as they were far from her shack. She said a woman was recently bitten by a snake in the bush. Councillor Xolani Simandla said he wasn’t in office when residents were promised they would be moved but he knew their situation was supposed to be temporary. “I can assure residents they are going to get their RDPs but the process takes time. “At the moment, we don’t have the budget but the municipality is busy with the first phase of a project to build drains,” he said. Municipal spokesman Bathandwa Diamond said a project was being planned in the area but she didn’t give details on how many RDPs were being built or respond to questions.
