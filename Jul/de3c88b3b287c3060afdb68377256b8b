THE FAMILY of a missing girl are beyond stressed out after receiving ransom demands from several different gangsters claiming to have kidnapped the child. According to Punch, Elo Ogidi (4) vanished during a church service at Christ Embassy in Lagos, Nigeria last Sunday. She was apparently being looked after at the time by her nanny. Traumatised dad Afokoghene Ogidi told Punch: “Several people have been calling us, demanding ransom but they are fraudsters that found our numbers from the flyers we put out. “One of them called and demanded N2,5 million (about R92 500), telling me that if I did not provide the money within 24 hours, he would kill my daughter. He later called me back that day demanding N500 000 (about R18 500) to feed my baby. “When I got home, I didn’t call him back because I know a kidnapper will not ask for feeding upkeep.” Ogidi also described harassing phone calls from a different man demanding ransom. “He called me the second day and told me that I did not want to comply and I told him I would comply, adding that I would give him more than the amount he asked for if only he could allow me to hear my daughter’s voice. “But he could not provide my daughter; he was just repeating the same statement of me not complying. With the trauma I was going through, I told him I know his location and I will get him arrested, so he stopped calling,” Ogidi said. Yet another kidnapping gang have been calling Ogidi’s sister demanding N18 million (about R6,7 million). “She told them that she wanted to hear her daughter’s voice and the fraudsters gave the phone to an adult to mimic a baby’s voice,” said the worried dad. Cops did not respond to Punch’s requests for comment.
