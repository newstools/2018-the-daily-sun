Instagram account of herself dancing or conducting an act that is considered “normal”
amongst women her age. She can normally be seen wearing western attire and
mostly without a mandatory Hijab in her videos. According to an Iranian Emagazine Shbooneh, Hojabri was
detained along with three other individuals, all of whom are it facing similar
charges, however, it has been reported that they were later released on bail. The arrest has given rise to solidarity amongst Iranian
women who have decided to post videos of themselves dancing in order to show
support to the young lady. The women are using the hashtag #DanceToFreedom to voice
their opinion and support for Hojabri, as well as #DancingIsNotACrime. However, according to Iranian police, they will continue
removing such content from the internet and if the problem persists the Iranian
judiciary may even consider blocking access to popular social media websites
such as Instagram, Twitter and Facebook Iran is known for taking staunch action against such
behavior, previously the authorities handed out a sentence of 91 lashes and one
year imprisonment to men and women that posted videos of similar nature on
social media. Women in Iran have started sharing videos of them dancing to music after Maedeh Hojabri, an 18-year-old teen known for her popular Instagram account filled with her dance videos, was detained by the Iranian government in recent weeks. Women in Iran are prohibited from showing flesh and dancing in front of men outside of their immediate family. On Friday, Hojabri gave a bizarre statement on a state TV broadcast saying she was aware she was breaking moral norms, but that it was not her intention and that she had only wanted to gain more followers. It was not clear if the confession was coerced ??????
