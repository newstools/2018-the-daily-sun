KZN Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube yesterday unveiled an energy saving green roof at their offices in Mayville, Durban. She told guests the pilot project, which involves installing solar panels on the building’s roof, had yielded positive results. “By unveiling this green rooftop at our offices, we’re excited to promote environmentally friendly solutions to how our public institutions operate,” she said. “This project will not only help save the environment but will also help with our spending on energy. “As we speak, we have reduced our electricity consumption by thousands of rands a month.” The MEC said they were planning to have all their offices install green roofs. “We are optimistic that in a few year’s time, our municipalities will save half of what we are paying now. Operating off the electrical grid completely would be a plus.” Dube-Ncube said the roof would also be installed at Grey’s Hospital, the office of the premier, the Ezemvelo Wildlife offices and Vryheid Hospital. Dube-Ncube also unveiled a special vehicle to make life easier for employees of the department living with disabilities. She said there were difficulties in transporting these workers to events.
