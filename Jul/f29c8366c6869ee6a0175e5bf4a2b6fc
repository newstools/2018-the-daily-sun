POVERTY is written all over their faces and they are in desperate need of help. The 63-year-old mother is unable to walk and crawls along the ground. The family from Siyazenzela kasi in Perdekop, near Volksrust in Mpumalanga, has been living in their two-roomed shack ever since they arrived in the area five years ago. The grant the mother, Grace Zondo (63) gets is too little to last them a month. She urgently needs a wheelchair. “We are drowning in poverty and we cannot afford to build a house. The money I get from my grant is too little. Life has hit us hard and we need help,” she told Daily Sun. “Our shack has holes everywhere and the roof leaks. We freeze in winter and don’t have enough blankets to keep us warm or clothes to wear. “In summer rain gets inside and we have to sleep standing or run to the neighbours.” Gogo Grace’s son July Mtshali (39) is mentally disabled and his sister Nurse Mtshali has never had an ID. She grew up on a farm and no one knows how old she is. They told the Sun Team that a ward councillor once visited them and gave them food parcels. Councillor Peaceman Moloi said social workers and the municipality were in the process of finding a temporary shelter for the family until their house is built. He said they had identified a stand where a special RDP would be built to accommodate gogo Grace’s disability.
