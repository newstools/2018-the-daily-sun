PARENTS from Mqukwane and KwaNqoko villages in Keiskammahoek, Eastern Cape are accusing the provincial department of education of neglecting their kids. This comes after Mqukwane Primary School was closed down in 2013, allegedly after two teachers threatened to resign due to the heavy workload. But it did not end there. Phakamisani Senior Secondary School, which is 100 metres away from Mqukwane, was also closed. Parents said their kids sometimes spend weeks without going to school because they don’t have money for school transport. Gogo Nomonde Gwexe (76), who depends on an old age grant to pay for scholar transport, said her three grandkids had been unable to attend school for some time now. She said: “Government is killing the future of our kids. How are they going to pass if they keep skipping classes? If there is no money, there is no school for them. I have to pay more than R1 000 from my pocket for their transport.” Another parent, Ntombekhaya Fani (59) said they were concerned about the future of their kids. “My two grandchildren have not gone to school since last week. They have to wait until I get my grant money. They will drop out of school if government does not intervene,” she said. Sanele Gwexe (13), a grade 7 pupil who dreams of becoming a policeman said: “We need transport from government. Staying at home for weeks is not good for our future. We miss a lot of classes.” Eastern Cape Education spokesman, Malibongwe Mtima said Mqukwane did not meet the minimum requirements and did not have enough pupils. “The closure of the school was based on the norms and standards policy. We give schools teachers based on the number of kids. Primary schools should have a minimum of 135 pupils. Parents were supposed to apply for scholar transport. I appeal to the parents to visit the nearest circuit office. I will refer this urgent matter to education officials,” he said.
