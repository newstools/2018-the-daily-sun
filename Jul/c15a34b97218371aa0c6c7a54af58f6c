WHERE others only saw trouble, these two brothers saw opportunity! After Teboho (31) and Alfonsi Mothibeli (45) saw the high rate of burglaries in their area, they came up with a plan to help residents stay safe while earning an income. They joined hands two years ago and started making burglar doors and steel gates. The men from Constantia kasi in Thabong, near Welkom are loved by the community. This is because their work is beautiful and of good quality. “My brother has been the expert and the master when it comes to steel work in our area. “I used to watch him make beautiful, strong gates and burglar doors for customers. “None of them have ever complained. We work together as a team and things have been going well,” said Teboho. They run their business from a small workshop at the busy main road between Manny’s and Thabong, where they also display their work. Alfonsi said they were also able to make steel pots at a reasonable price. “All the customers need to do is to tell us what they want us to make and we deliver. We’ve made steel gates and burglar doors that no one has ever broken into.” Resident Teboho Maphalla said Alfonsi built the fence at his four-room house after he became a target of thugs. “I asked him in 2012 to build me a fence and I haven’t experienced any burglaries at my house since then.”
