FOUR suspects aged between 20 and 28 were expected to appear in the Hluhluwe Magistrates Court in northern KZN yesterday. They were arrested on Saturday following a police operation by the KwaMsane tactical response teams in Ezibayeni, Hluhluwe and Nongoma. According to KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala, the four suspects are facing charges of possession of an unlicensced firearm, ammunition, possession of suspected stolen property and attempted murder of police officials. Gwala said the operation, which ran from Friday to Saturday, started with a search for wanted suspects linked to various cases. Cops spotted a blue Toyota Tazz travelling in the Mthekwini area, Hluhluwe and tried to stop the vehicle, but it sped off. She said while racing off, the suspects started shooting at the cops. “During the crossfire, one of the suspects sustained an injury. Two suspects, including the injured one, were arrested at the scene. A firearm with 11 rounds of ammunition was found on the suspects. The injured suspect was taken to hospital for medical attention and is under police guard,” said Gwala. She said the other two suspects fled the scene on foot into the nearby bush. “The team worked tirelessly and searched for the two suspects. They were traced and arrested in the Nongoma area while trying to flee to Gauteng,” she said. Gwala said an investigation showed that the firearm was stolen in Gauteng during a robbery in 2014 and the vehicle was stolen in Hluhluwe this month. “The two suspects are also linked to charges of robbery, murder and attempted murder committed in Gauteng and Ezibayeni. They will be profiled to check if they are linked to other cases in Zululand.”
