MELROSE Arch Gallery celebrated what would have been Nelson Mandela’s 100th birthday this July with an exhibition dedicated to the great man he was. On Wednesday, various artists and art lovers gathered to celebrate a world icon through the finest of art displays. The exhibition was curated by Zanele Mashumi, the founder of Mashumi Art Projects. This exhibition joins various Mandela 100 festivities taking place across the country in celebration of his centenary. The event was attended by former president Kgalema Motlanthe and started off with Pitika Ntuli and his wife reciting poems for Madiba. Pitika is a South African sculptor who spent 32 years of his life in exile. He read a poem dedicated to Tata by his grandchildren during his memorial. He said the art on display included paintings, sculpture, prints, cartoon illustrations and tapestry. Internationally renowned artist Esther Mahlangu was among those who showed their work for Madiba. The exhibition coincided with Pitika unveiling an 18 ton granite monument dedicated to Tata. “It took me five years to create this monument. I named the work Provocation to Reconciliation. “I was inspired by the great man’s dedication to the struggle and his principles. “It will honour his true spirit and love for people, especially children, that was evident in everything he did.”
