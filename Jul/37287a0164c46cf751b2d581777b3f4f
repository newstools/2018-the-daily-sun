MZANSI was the source of a Listeriosis outbreak earlier this year. While it was brought under control, there are still safety concerns. According to the Food Standards Agency, four out of five people globally put themselves at risk of food-related illnesses due to poor kitchen hygiene. James Khoza, president of the South African Chefs Association, said: “It’s important for us to understand the ways bacteria can spread during food handling, preparation and storage.” Karin Kok, the G360 solutions and institutions support manager of Middle East and Africa for ECOLAB with the chef association, shares three steps to avoid food related illnesses. Keep the kitchen clean In most homes and offices, the kitchen harbours more germs than all other rooms. This is why a clean kitchen is so important. Worktop counters, chopping boards and utensils need to be disinfected and the dish cloths and tea towels need to be replaced regularly. Clean and disinfect spills immediately whether they are juices or fluids from animal products Store food properly Check best-before dates and use refrigerated leftovers within three days. Divide leftovers in shallow containers with the date of storage on the lid. Prepare food properly Germs are moved during food preparation which is why it is important to handle food with clean hands. Wash your hands completely with warm water and soap before preparing food. Cook all meat at temperatures above 60°C, except for chicken which should be above 75°C. Reheat food above 60°C.
