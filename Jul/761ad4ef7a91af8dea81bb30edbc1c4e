A sixty-four-year-old woman is facing multiple charges
after repeatedly tormenting her neighbours. Watch her crazy tricks in the footage below! According to Stomp,
Chen Xiu Er from Yishun in Singapore finally had the law book thrown at her in
April when she was charged with 36 offences, including being a public nuisance,
mischief, theft and violating an Exclusion Order. During her hearing this week, the court heard how she harassed
and pestered her gatvol neighbours in her block of flats over the period of a
year. She poured salt, oil or even pee in front of their doors. Sometimes she
even chucked sanitary pads on their doorsteps. She stole a pair of slippers
worth about R140. She even put loo paper on a neighbours bicycle. The motive behind her weirdness was not given. She was arrested in May last year. Her trial continues on 12 July.
