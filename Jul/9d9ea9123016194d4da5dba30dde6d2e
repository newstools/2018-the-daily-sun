THE Council for Quality Assurance in General and Further
Education and Training body, Umalusi has exposed websites that sell fake matric
certificate. Umalusi says it is terrible that the people who manage these
websites continue to do it with freely. Umalusi CEO Dr Mafu Rakometsi said he wants to assure South
Africans that the law will be extremely harsh on those selling fake matric
certificates. Rakometsi warned that this is illegal and constitutes a
criminal offence that is punishable by law. He said the misrepresentation of qualifications causes
potential damage to the image of Umalusi, the country’s education system. “All members of the public are urged to vigilantly report
unscrupulous individuals and entities to the South African Police Service,” Ramoketsi
said. All public and private entities that want to ascertain the
credentials of their employees are advised to visit Umalusi website: UMALUSI. Ramoketsi noted that various verification agencies can be
used for the verification of qualifications issued by Umalusi. As the Council for Quality Assurance in General and Further
Education and Training, Umalusi is tasked with the responsibility of developing
and managing a sub-framework of qualifications and quality assurance.
