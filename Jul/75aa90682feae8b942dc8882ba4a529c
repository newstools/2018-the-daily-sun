INSTEAD of enjoying the high life, businessman Tebogo Pooe is giving back to his community. He is partnering with the education department to build a new office block at Moruta Thuto Primary School in Meadowlands, Soweto. Yesterday teachers, politicians and residents watched as Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi turned the first sod for building to begin at the school. Infrastructure development MEC Jacob Mamabolo and former principals of the school also attended the event. Lesufi told the crowd a real man invests in youth’s education. “I am humbled and touched by the noble idea of investing in our education system. Our friends and colleagues boast over social media about how much they spend on booze, rather than investing in our society. “Most will flaunt new cars and forget investment is needed in our communities and is more important.” The MEC thanked Pooe’s foundation for the investment, saying schools were more than just places where kids were taught. “Funerals and weddings take place at our schools and churches operate from them.” Pooe said the project was close to his heart. “Transforming society can never be only government’s responsibility,” he said.
