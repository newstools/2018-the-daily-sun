THERE seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel for mine safety. At a briefing in Joburg on Monday, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research mining experts Dave Roberts, Shaniel Davrajh and Michael van Schoor displayed new technology to deal with the dangers of mining. This included the Monster Robot that checks for possible rock falls before miners enter an area. Designed to inspect a hanging wall, the machine identifies risks before workers enter unsupported areas. Roberts said radar sends a radio pulse to search for cracks and separations between rocks. The robot measures the rock temperature that shows if there is a risk of falling rock as it comes loose from the main rock. He said the machines are not supposed to replace miners or reduce the number of people working at mines but will ensure they work in safer spaces. Van Schoor said mining companies are aware of the new technology. “We are trying to get test sites at the mines and show the technology to them,” he said.
