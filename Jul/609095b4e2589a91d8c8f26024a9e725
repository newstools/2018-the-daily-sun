CHRISTOPHER Botsane needs to connect with his ancestors on his father’s side. The 31-year-old from Rustenburg, North West, told Daily Sun he had not seen his father since he left to work in Joburg when Christopher was a baby. Christopher said in 2011, church elders told him unless he found his father, Petrus Nduvane, he would never find happiness. He said things were made worse when his mum died years ago. He said no one knew the Nduvanes, who were probably from Mozambique. “In the 1980s, my dad was working at Impala Platinum Mine as a migrant worker when he met my mum, who was a domestic worker in Rustenburg. But he left when I was very young,” he said. Christopher said in 2005, his mum managed to trace his father, who was believed to be a businessman, but the old man had car problems and his mum’s cellphone went missing after she died the next year. “I’m not sure by which names my father knows my mother. But she was Mathapelo Botsane or Tshose. My aunt gave me a picture which she said was my father,” he said.
