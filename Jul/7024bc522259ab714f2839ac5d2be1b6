RESIDENTS were happy when they heard they would be given RDP houses. But the houses that were to be built for the people of Soshanguve block TT in Tshwane in 2016 have never been completed. The residents told Daily Sun they had been living in shacks for many years, until former housing MEC Paul Mashatile told them they would be getting new houses. They were told to restructure their shacks to make space for the houses, which they did. Madala Sello Vilakazi (65) said he demolished his four-roomed shack and built a small shack, just big enough to accommodate his family and their belongings. “We were told the houses would be completed within six months, but two years later nothing has happened.” Sello said construction workers had left them in an incomplete house. Councillor Maria Skhosana said she had been trying to push for the houses to be completed, but it was a provincial matter. “I wish the houses were completed by now. I see the circumstances the people are living under.” Keith Khoza, a spokesman for the Gauteng Human Settlements Department, said the building was stopped because the main contractors had problems with their sub-contractors and payments. “The people involved in the project assured us that the houses will be completed before the end of this financial year,” he said.
