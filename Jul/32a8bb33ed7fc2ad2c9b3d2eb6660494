For centuries it has been believed that wine is good for your health and even earned the name "drink of the Gods". The roots of the South African wine industry can be traced back to the exploration of the Dutch East India Company when a supply station was established in Cape Town. Recent studies have borne out this belief, showing that certain substances found in red wine protect the body against serious health problems such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. HERE ARE SOME OF THE BENEFITS FROM RED WINE: - Protection from diabetes and obesity; - Prevention of cell damage by free radicals (unstable atoms which can lead to premature aging, certain types of cancer, and loss of brain function); - Reduced inflammation; - Decreased risk of clotting, a major factor in heart disease. - What are the best natural sources of resveratrol?Because red wine is fermented with the skin of the grapes, it contains a high concentration of resveratrol. However, if you are not a wine drinker, there are several other good dietary sources for this important antioxidant:- Grapes and grape juice; - Blueberries; - Peanuts; - Red wine extracts; - Grape seed pills.
