ZWELIHLE kasi in Hermanus on the southern coast of the Western Cape appeared calm yesterday. But underneath the surface, people remained in a hostage situation. Only a few people dared to go to work. The majority of people stayed at home, fearing retaliation from the protesting group. Scared residents claim that a list was made of all those who went to work yesterday. The troubled kasi has been in a lockdown since protests over the arrest of a community leader escalated last week. Residents told Daily Sun they were still afraid despite Zwelihle Stakeholders convener Masizole Mnqasela’s assurance in a voice note on Sunday evening. “Residents of Zwelihle, it is your choice whether you want to go to work. Nobody has a right to decide your fate. “The police are working tirelessly day in and day out and there is an extended mandate to ensure they clear the streets of any intimidation,” said Mnqasela. Resident Nosiphiwo Mbebe (39) said: “I want to go work but I don’t trust these people. They will burn my house as they did to others. “I would rather lose my job than lose my house.” Overstrand municipal spokeswoman Riana Steenekamp said there have been no signs of active protest action since Friday morning. The R43 remains open and clearing of the main access roads to Zwelihle has begun. “A large group of police and other stakeholders remain present,” said Steenekamp. Mnqasela added: “Any person who prevents you from going to work or threatens your belongings or property must be reported to the police at the taxi rank. “The police will ensure that while you are at work your property is protected. “If any person threatens you, call me on 084 628 4167.”
