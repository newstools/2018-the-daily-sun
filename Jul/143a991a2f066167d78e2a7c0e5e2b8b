FOUR suspects were killed while two were injured in a shoot-out with cops in Canelands, north of Durban, on Wednesday. Captain Nqobile Gwala said cops received information about a group of armed suspects travelling in a car. They’d allegedly been involved in a number of robberies and hijackings in Durban previously. “The men were allegedly on their way to commit a robbery when the car they were travelling in was spotted by cops on the R102 near Canelands,” she said. Gwala said when police tried to pull the vehicle over, the suspects shot at them. “Four suspects were fatally wounded while the other two were wounded,” she told Daily Sun. “The injured suspects were taken to hospital under police guard. Police recovered three unlicenced firearms. They also seized a police radio, a pick and a hammer from the suspects.” Gwala said investigations at the scene revealed the car used by the suspects had been hijacked in Sydenham last month. “The arrested suspects will be charged with attempted murder and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition.” “Anyone with information should call Umlazi cops on 031 325 5530 or 08600 10111,” said Gwala.
