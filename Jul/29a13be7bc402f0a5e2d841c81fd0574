A NIGERIAN traditional healer must have regretted his
confidence after the bulletproof charm he had made for a client failed the
test. According to Punch,
Chinaka Adoezuwe (26) from a village in the Isiala Mbano area in the south of
the country had been asked by one of his customers, Chukwudi Ljezie, to prepare
muthi for him that would prevent bullets from penetrating his flesh. Eyewitnesses say that Chinaka invited Chukwudi to shoot
at him while he wore the magic charm he had prepared around his neck, to
confirm its powers. Villager Kingsley Ugochukwu told Punch: “The bullet penetrated Chinaka’s body, resulting in the
instant death of the native doctor.” Cop Andrew Enwerem said: “The suspect is in our custody;
it is a case of murder. The Isiala Mbano division of the command moved in to
arrest the suspect and return normalcy to the area. “The case will be transferred to the State Criminal
Investigation and Intelligence Department.”
