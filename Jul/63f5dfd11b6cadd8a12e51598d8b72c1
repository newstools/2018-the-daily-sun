A NEWBORN baby was found abandoned in an open space in the early hours of yesterday morning. A security guard found the baby at Ibika Clinic in Butterworth, Eastern Cape. She told Daily Sun: “I was patrolling at about 4am when I saw something covered with cardboard and a small blanket. “I tried to kick it but I was very shocked to see a baby lift its hand. I called the nurses, who took the baby to Butterworth Hospital.” The baby was found with a note, which read: “Please take care of me or give me up for adoption. I deserve better than my mother could give me.” Eastern Cape Health Department spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha told the People’s Paper the baby was doing well in hospital. “He is healthy and in good condition. We are going to report this matter to the police and open a case. We are also going to report the matter to social workers,” he said. Social development department spokesman Mzukisi Solani said: “The department only intervenes in matters like this when the baby is a certain age. “We take them to a place of safety or someone that wants to adopt them but only after the police have investigated.” Police spokesman Captain Jackson Manatha said no case was opened yet. “We will investigate when a case has been opened.”
