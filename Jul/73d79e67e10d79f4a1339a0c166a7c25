THE historic Clarkebury High School in Ngcobo has promised a 100% matric pass rate in honour of a former pupil, Nelson Mandela. Madiba was a pupil at the school between 1932 and 1934. Yesterday Eastern Cape education MEC Mandla Makuphula also opened two hostels in honour of Mandela and mama Albertina Sisulu. Principal Ayanda Matshayana said the department had fulfilled their dream of having a hostel. “The building of the hostels was approved in 2007. “We are happy that our pupils will be in one place. We will now have access to them and they will attend extra classes without worrying about their safety when they go home,” said Ayanda. He said all the matric pupils were being accommodated at the hostels. “This will help in discipline and improve our results. “We commit to 100% for Madiba. Pupils will be safe now,” Ayanda said. Uganda Kwaza, a matric pupil, said last year he had rented a flat for R1 000 a month. “It is better to stay at the hostel than to rent. “I had to wake up at 4am and leave my flat at 6am. We have guards here who look after us when we knock off from our study sessions at 10pm,” he said. Makuphula said the building of the new hostel had cost R34 million and it would accommodate 700 pupils. The school has more than 800 pupils. The MEC also donated a tractor and equipment worth R300 000 to help with newly introduced agricultural studies. “We want the tractor to help the whole community to fight poverty,” Makuphula said. He asked the community to look after the hostels.
