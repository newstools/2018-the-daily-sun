THESE young people are proud of themselves. Instead of complaining about being jobless, they started Ghetto Youth Catering in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. The fast food business was started earlier this year by Daniel Waka (35) and his three friends. They sell fried chips and sausages. Their prices range between R10 and and R20. Daniel told Daily Sun: “We started the business earlier this year after battling for years to find work. “I have three partners and business is good so far. “This is my full-time job and I doubt if I will work for another person. “Our tasty chips are the best in the kasi and many people support us. “We make sure that we prepare the chips well because competition is tough. Many people sell chips in the kasi.” He said sometimes they are hired to cook for people at events. “Even though we have a spot at YB squatter camp, we are hardly there because we move from one event to another.” Daniel said every weekend they sell chips and sausages to students at False Bay TVET College in Khayelitsha. “One of my friends was a student at the college. “He also worked at the college canteen,” said Daniel. “When he resigned from work he joined forces with us. “That’s when we started selling chips and sausages at the college.” He said they are always busy, especially at the weekends. “When we have two or more events on, we split into two teams so we can cover both events. “Sometimes we hire people on a part-time basis to help us.” Part-time worker Wendy Mkhenke (22) said she was happy to work with Daniel. “I enjoy my work here because we are always busy,” she said. “The money I earn helps me look after myself. “And I’m able to save some of it every month.”
