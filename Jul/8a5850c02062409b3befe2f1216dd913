TRADITIONAL healers don’t kill people – they only heal the sick. This was what traditional healer Lilly Sambo said at an imbizo held at Phola, in Mpumalanga on Friday. The imbizo, aimed at discussing challenges facing people with albinism, was organised by Phola police. Gogo Lilly lashed out at bogus healers who use body parts for muthi. “They’re not real healers but murderers. We know most of these killers because they live among us,” she said. “As real sangomas we have a problem when an albino gets killed because all fingers point at us. We get painted with the same brush.” Lilly said human body parts and blood were not allowed in their ndumbas. “We ask our ancestors and God to help us get rid of these murderers because our children are living in constant fear. This is unacceptable,” said the gogo. Tryphina Nhlapo, who is living with albinism, told Daily Sun the killings had forced her to change her lifestyle. “I don’t go out at night anymore. My family fear for my safety. My husband sleeps with a golf club under his pillow and my son is always armed with a hockey stick, ready to attack whoever might try to harm me,” she said. Constable Thapelo Ntuli said continued abductions and killings of defenceless albinos was worrying. “The public need to be educated on albinism. It’s a condition, not a lucky charm.” Julia Mahlangu from the Department of Education said: “Our blood is the same. It’s our social responsibility to make our kids feel free and safe at schools. “Communities must also support and protect these innocent people.”
