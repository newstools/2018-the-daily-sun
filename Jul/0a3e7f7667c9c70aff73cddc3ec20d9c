A VISITOR to Barberton Maximum Prison in Mpumalanga was bust on Sunday. He had 61 sticks of nyaope with a street value of R10 000 hidden in his jacket. According to communications manager Messiah Hlungwani, all members visiting the centre were searched at the access control gate to check for illegal substances. “The visitor was caught with a powdery substance which was suspected to be nyaope,” he said. Hlungwani said they called the cops who confirmed at the scene that the substance was nyaope. Dumisa Dhlamini (37) was arrested and taken to Barberton Police Station where a case of smuggling contraband and dealing in drugs was opened. He appeared at the Barberton Magistrates Court on Monday and was charged with contravening the Correctional Services Act and dealing in drugs. He was granted R1 000 bail and his case was postponed to 3 August. Hlungwani said the smuggling of drugs into prisons was worrying. This year alone, 15 people have been arrested for the crime.
