ONE of Mzansi’s favourite daughters has announced that she’s ready to tie the knot – and the entire country is happy for her. Good wishes have been pouring in for her since the former public protector, advocate Thuli Madonsela announced on SABC that she was no longer on the market. News of her engagement broke on Tuesday during her interview on Real Talk hosted by Azania Mosaka. Azania congratulated Madonsela on her engagement. While Madonsela was prepared to admit she was happily in love, she didn’t give away many details regarding the wedding. “Both my future husband and myself would prefer to keep the details private for the moment.” In a text message to TimesLIVE she said: “We have not set a date yet. I would rather not announce the name of the other party until we set the final date.” Not surprisingly, Madonsela who is known to be a private person, said she and her partner would like to keep the engagement and wedding off the radar. Madonsela was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2014. She has been described as a person who has carved a lasting reputation as one of the country’s most trusted public servants. Khanyi_Magubane tweeted: “Congrats, Thuli Madonsela. May this be a great time of joy and an overflow of blessings. “Thank you for being a woman living life according to her own rules and not society’s conventions.”
