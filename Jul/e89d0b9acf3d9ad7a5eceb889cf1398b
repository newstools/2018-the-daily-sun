A GANG fight about ownership of the kasi led to the death and mutilation of two men on Friday in Meqheleng, Ficksburg. Rumours are that when the Born to Kill and the Maroma gangs fight, someone’s heart has to be taken out to prove the killing. Residents in the kasi now fear for their lives, saying the gangs sometimes mistake them for rival gang members. A resident said he saw how the men were killed on Friday on his way to the shop. “A group of men chased two men with knives.” He said he was so terrified he hid in the back of a bakkie parked at the side of the road. “The group cornered the men and started stabbing them. “Then one came with a butcher’s knife and cut open the stomach of one of the men and left with what seemed to be his heart.” He said he thought the two gangs were competing to see who got the most hearts from their rivals. “The man died a terrible death. I could see he was still trying to breathe as the man cut him open. The group fled before the cops came to the scene.” A worried resident said their kasi is not safe. “These boys fight over ruling the kasi,” he said. “I have a 23-year-old and a 19-year-old and I fear for their lives. “I have told them not to walk around the streets as the gangs could mistake them for gang members.” Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said: “We are investigating a case of murder. A 33-year-old man was arrested.” The suspect will appear in court soon.
