MMC for roads and transport Sheila Senkubuge announced that the city has made progress in repairing some of the dangerous sinkholes in Tshwane. Senkubuge said the sinkhole on Jean Avenue in Centurion has been partially repaired and a part of the road will be opened soon. Tshwane, especially the south side, has recorded numerous sinkholes in recent times. Businesses and people living and working in these areas have been inconvenienced. The sinkholes have cost the city millions to repair. Senkubuge added that the city has been dealing with 31 sinkholes so far. She said two of the five sinkholes were repaired in the 2017/18 financial year, with the remaining three set for completion in the first quarter of the year. She said three additional sinkholes will be repaired during the current financial year. The recent large sinkhole is on Quagga Road near Laudium. “The repairs of the sinkhole began in April after the rainy season and is 90% finished, with planned completion scheduled for the end of August.” She said at least R27,5 million was allocated to speed up the process of repairing five of the worst sinkholes. “R25 million will be made available in the 2018/19 financial year for the rehabilitation of the sinkholes,” she said. She urged residents to report signs of sinkholes developing in their areas as soon as they noticed them to ensure they are dealt with quickly.
