“THUGS have made our school their playground.” These were the words of Phumla Sibene, the principal of Sivile Primary School in Mandalay, Khayelitsha. She said since January, the school has been broken into three times. The latest incident happened on Friday. “The thugs stole two computers, two printers with scanners, one photocopy machine, 10 bags of toilet paper, a microwave, two burner stove and an electric kettle. “A fax machine, four electric heaters and cellphones confiscated from pupils also disappeared,” said Sibene. She told Daily Sun the thugs had gained entry through the roof. Phumla said the first incident happened three days after the school reopened in January. “The thugs had broken into the administration block and stolen valuables. They came back in February and stole more items.” Jessica Shelver, a spokesman for Western Cape Education Department, said they were aware of the incident. “Schools are often targeted during the winter holidays. She said last year during the winter holidays, 15 schools were vandalised or burgled. “We have found that the safest schools are those where local people help to look after the property,” said Shelver. Western Cape police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut, said Mandalay cops were investigating a case of theft.
