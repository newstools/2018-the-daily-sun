THE family of Mziwamabhoto Nontshikila (31) was horrified to find his charred body still sitting upright inside his burned shack on Saturday. According to his brother-in-law, Alungile Sgagayi, he and other family members went to investigate after a passerby told them the shack in extension 7 of Mount Frere, Eastern Cape, was burning. “We found the shack burning but we were not sure if anyone was inside because there were no sounds. We called the fire station as we do not have water here. “It was only after the fire died down that we found Mzi sitting on a chair and leaning against the shack’s wall.” Mziwamabhoto’s devasted relatives said they suspected that he might have fallen asleep while cooking. His aunt, who did not want to be named, said: “Judging by the position we found him in, he might have died of smoke inhalation.” She said the family was unhappy with the cops. “We reported the case just after midnight and we were told the police had gone to the scene of the shooting of a cop. “This hurt us a lot. Why should the other case be considered more important?” An inquest docket was opened.
