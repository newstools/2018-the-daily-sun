THESE kids are putting their lives at risk. Children from Europe kasi in Nyanga, Cape Town, often play in dirty water caused by heavy rain. The SunTeam saw boys playing in the water on Saturday. A boy (14) told Daily Sun: “We’re from the squatter camp, and that’s why we often come and play in this water. “We don’t have swimming pools like people who live in the suburbs.” Another boy said: “This is our entertainment during the school holidays. “We’ll go back home later when our parents come back from work.” Baphelo Sikhotsi (44) from Nyanga said: “The water is stagnant and stinks as time goes on. Kids don’t realise this. “My young son used to play in water ponds with his friends. I warned him about the dangers of playing there.” Jean-Pierre Smith, a member of the mayoral committee for safety and security, said: “The starting point is that parents should warn children about playing in such water. “This is because stagnant water may be contaminated with sewage that could lead to diarrhoea and other waterborne sicknesses. “Diarrhoea gets worse in summer. That doesn’t mean kids don’t get sick in the cold. “When parents realise their kids have diarrhoea symptoms such as abdominal cramps and pains, urgency to go to the toilet, frequent passing of loose watery faeces, nausea and vomiting, they should rush them to their nearest clinics.”
