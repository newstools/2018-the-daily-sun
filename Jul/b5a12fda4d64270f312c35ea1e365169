SOME shack dwellers in Cape Town spent the entire weekend trapped on top of their furniture in flooded homes as heavy rain and wind lashed the Mother City. Yonela Macebo (27), from KTC in Nyanga said she had been trapped on a chair while her shack filled with water. “I am so stressed because all my belongings are damaged,” she said. “I don’t know where I’m going to sleep.” When Daily Sun arrived on Sunday morning she was busy trying to get the water out of her house but it wasn’t working. “The problem is that water keeps streaming back in,” she said. Yonela lives with her two-year-old daughter and is pregnant. “This is difficult. We are so worried because the weather doesn’t look like it’s going to clear anytime soon.” Noluvuyo Dyani (36) from Siyanyanzela, Browns Farm, in Philippi lives with her six children. Her kids were all sitting on a bed while she tried to remove water from her shack. “We are hoping that someone will come and assist us because we don’t have anywhere else to go,” she said. All their belongings have been damaged, including their groceries. “It was month end and we bought food with our grant money but it looks like we wasted it all because the water damaged everything,” she said. Siphokazi Nakana (39) from KTC said they tried to build a sand wall to keep the water out but it didn’t help at all. “All the sand was simply washed away by the rain,” said Nakana.
