WHEN gogo Sophie Seakamela applied for an RDP house, she was 60 years old. That was 20 years ago. Today, at 80 years, she has one last plea. Give me my house before I die! Gogo Sophie told Daily Sun she had been living in a shack her whole life and felt let down by her government. As the years keep going by, her dream that she will one day own a house of her own is fading. The 80-year-old gogo from Block X in Soshanguve, northern Tshwane, said she had been sent from pillar to post over the past 20 years by a government that promised to build her an RDP house. She said her husband and two of her children died before they could live in a proper house. She said she was sad to watch as her neighbours and other residents received their houses. She told Daily Sun that even residents who settled in the area after her were given houses, while she was left in a shack. “When we registered for houses, I was first on the list. I thought I would be first to get an RDP, but it seems I will be the last – if I get a house at all!” she said. The gogo said she had become a nuisance to her councillor, Maria Rallele, by pestering her about the house. “I am old now. If I had the strength, I would build a house myself so that I can rest in peace.” Ward 27 councillor Rallele acknowledged the gogo’s frustration. She said she had been working non-stop to get her a house, but it was difficult since it was a matter that could be addressed only by the provincial department of human settlements. “I sent a request to the department for an explanation of why they have not yet built gogo Seakamela’s house. From my knowledge she should have had her house a long time ago,” she said. Rallele said the poor gogo was not the only person who needed help. “There are a lot of elderly people and orphaned children who have been cheated by the system. I will not rest until they all have their houses,” she said.
