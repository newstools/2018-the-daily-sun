Spectualation has arise as Musician Mampinsha posted pictures on his social media with ex fiance Babes Wodumo. Rumours about this couple are always surfacing. Not so long ago, the couple were rumoured to be married and pregnant, however, Babes squashed the pregnancy rumours. Shortly after that, the Gqom Queen appeared on an interview at Metro FM with Radio Presenter's Masechaba Ndlovu and Mo Flava, confessing that her ex-fiance and boss Mampintsha has physically abused her. Yesterday, Mampintsha posted a picture of the two of them and captioned it saying, "LOVE PEACE GROWTH and GREATNESS". Babes replied to the post with a few red heart emojis. Hmmmmmmm, we wonder what that means?
