NELSON Mandela Bay residents who have been living among rubbish for weeks can breathe fresh air again. The municipality and striking workers have reached an agreement over back pay bonuses dating back to 2000. The South African Municipal Workers’ Union demanded R30 000 each as long service back pay, permanent employment for contract workers, a non-discriminatory travel and overtime allowances and the end to suspension of workers. The union told the workers about the agreement at the Feathers Market Hall on last week. A worker who had been employed at the municipality for 25 years said he was pleased that he would be able to complete building his house. “It’s a good victory, even though we did not get the R30 000 we demanded at first. “I’ll be getting R21 000. I will use the money to complete the building of my house in Motherwell.” Municipal manager Johann Mettler said the metro would use about R44 million to pay the striking workers their long service back pay. “We agreed on a final settlement of R10 000 for employees with 12 to 17 years, R16 000 for employees with 18 to 23 years and R21 000 for employees with service of 24 years and more.” Mettler said they were waiting for the council’s approval by not later than 15 July. He said all the 458 security workers, who were on contract employment, would be employed full time from 1 July. Mettler said issues such as overtime allowances, prolonged suspensions and the scarce skills matter would be discussed with the employees later.
