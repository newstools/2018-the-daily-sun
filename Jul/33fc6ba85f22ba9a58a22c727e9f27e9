HUNDREDS of youths filled the Saul Tsotetsi Sports Complex in Sebokeng, in the Vaal on Wednesday. They came hoping to hear of employment opportunities and they didn’t leave disappointed. Jubilation was the order of the day as thousands are set to have their lives changed forver. With millions of young people unemployed in the Vaal, a public-private partnership between SetSquare, a black-owned property developer, the Services Seta, local and district municipalities and the provincial department of human settlements delivered the good news about jobs. The joint effort comes as a new development is currently underway in Boiketlong, one of the kasis where protests are most frequent. A number of construction projects have already started. The Lethabong project alone will see 3 623 houses being built as well as a shopping centre, a creche, two primary schools and a high school in Sebokeng. This will give an opportunity to about 10 000 people to acquire new skills or have their prior experience recognised. Speaking at the meeting, Services Seta CEO Andile Nongogo said they were delighted to be a partner in such a visionary venture. “This is certainly one of the biggest developments of its kind. “The project restores the hope and dignity of our people regardless of their age and circumstances,” he said. Daily Sun spoke to a number of unemployed yet qualified youth. They believe the project will change their lives for the better. Sibongile Mazibuko (26) , a civil engineering graduate from the Vaal University of Technology, said she had already lost hope of ever finding a job. “With this project and the possible opportunities, at least we can make use of our qualifications.”
