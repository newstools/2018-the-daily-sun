WESTERN Cape Premier Helen Zille and Health MEC Dr Nomafrench Mbombo officially opened a new healthcare facility in Cape Town on Wednesday. It cost the government R104 million to build District Six Community Day Centre, which has been operating since February. The facility took four years to build. “The opening of this centre must result in the speeding up of the District Six development project. “The project should have been completed years ago. “Factors such as community conflicts and financial limitations stalled the development,” said Zille. Mbombo said: “The services offered here are still the same as those provided at other facilities. “However, this centre also has physiotherapists as well as services such as dental and eye care. “It’s the whole package. “The centre opens at 7am and closes at about 5pm.” Members of the community said the building of the health facility has made their lives easier. Resident Chumani Zenzile (23) said: “We are glad to have a health centre on our door step.” Lorraine Matthews (39), another resident, said: “I live just two streets away from the health centre. “When I have a problem, I just walk to the centre. Before that I had to take a taxi to Woodstock.”
