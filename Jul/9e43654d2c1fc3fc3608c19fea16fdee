FORMER Malawian president Joyce Banda attended prayers at
TB Joshua’s Synagogue Church of All Nations in Nigeria on Sunday – and was felled
by the power of his touch! Watch the video below! According to Nyasa
Times, Banda made the trip to Lagos to worship with the controversial
prophet with her husband, children and sister. She can be seen in Sunday’s footage by Emmanuel TV gingerly holding her
head after TB Joshua’s forceful blessing. It is reported that the former president may be interested
in throwing her head wrap in the ring to contest next year’s elections. Banda told Nyasa
Times that she visits TB Joshua’s Lagos temple in the same way Jews visit
Israel or Muslims visit Mecca. She is reportedly a firm believer in divine intervention
and may be hoping that the prophet’s spiritual touch will make the difference in
her presidential ambitions. The Synagogue Church of All Nations is a popular
destination for many of Africa’s leaders. According to Pulse, presidents and former presidents who have made the
pilgrimage include George Weah (Liberia); Goodluck Jonathan (Nigeria); John
Magufuli (Tanzania); and John Atta Mills (Ghana). South African political notables who have attended
prayers at TB Joshua’s temple include Julius Malema, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela
and Goodwill Zwelithini.
