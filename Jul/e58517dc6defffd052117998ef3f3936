POLICE Minister Bheki Cele visited Zwelihle yesterday to meet residents. During his visit on Friday to the troubled kasi outside Hermanus, in the Western Cape, he was not well received. On Friday, Cele told residents he wasn’t there to negotiate with them but to tell them what was going to happen. When chaos broke out, a cop was beaten and his gun taken. Zwelihle Renewal member Siyabulela Nothwala said they have been striking for two weeks and just wanted it to end. “We are happy the minister agreed to come and listen to us because last week, he just went to the municipality without hearing our side of the story. “We told him the root of the problem is service delivery. We are very happy he agreed to visit community leaders who were arrested.” Another Zwelihle Renewal member, Sicelo Gxamesi, told residents they could go to work today, saying Cele had said the national health, education, labour, justice and human settlements departments would deal with their problems. “The police beat us for nothing. We didn’t have the gun they said we did. Overstrand Municipality is causing conflict between us and the police.” Resident Zwai Skhosana said they wanted cops to be charged for their treatment of the crowd, as some people lost their eyes. Cele said if residents were allowed to go to school and work, he would ask Ipid to investigate and remove police from the area. Releasing the community leaders wasn’t in his hands as their cases had to go to court.
