ARTS and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa says his department’s work is not done while people still cannot use libraries. He said they needed to make sure all residents have access to libraries, not only in Mzansi but in the whole of Africa. Mthethwa was speaking at a ministerial round table event to discuss the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the programme for an African Cultural Renaissance at Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban yesterday. Delegates came from Botswana, Mozambique, Lesotho, the DRC and other African countries. The theme was “libraries”. Mthethwa said Mzansi supported 91 national libraries, 5 000 school libraries and 23 university libraries. “But thousands still do not have access to them. “We still need to work hard to make sure everyone has access to information,” he said. “As we meet here, we will come up with ways to improve access.” He said most important was to find ways to encourage people to write in African languages. African Library and Information Associations and Institutions president John Tsebe said libraries have improved around Africa. “I can see the passion in you to keep your heritage alive,” he said. African Union culture division head Angela Martins hoped the meeting would bear fruit and promote literature. “By improving and building more libraries, we promote the culture of reading and writing.”
