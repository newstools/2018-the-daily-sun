CELL C has launched new bundles that include access to WhatsApp and Facebook. The ShoutOut bundles are based on the original WhatsApp bundle that Cell C offered. The communications company has taken its current WhatsApp bundle and doubled the data for only R2 more. This means that for only R17, customers will now get 1200MB to use on both WhatsApp and Facebook for 30 days with ShoutOut R17. “This is certainly the best value for money bundle available in the market for social media addicts and being able to include Facebook into this offer just reinforces Cell C’s commitment to bringing customers the services that they value most,” Cell C Chief Commercial Officer, Junaid Munshi said. The R4 option provides customers with an inexpensive daily option to access WhatsApp and Facebook. The bundle is valid for 24 hours and allows customers up to 80MB to access the two platforms. According to Munshi, the offer has been designed to provide customers more disposable income for those seeking greater value amidst tougher economic times. “The top of the range bundle for our true social addicts, is the ShoutOut R49, which gives access to WhatsApp and Facebook for a massive 4GB for 30 days,” Munshi said.
