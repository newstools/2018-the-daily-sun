Hosts Russia's dream run at the 2018 World Cup continued as they put out their more fancied last 16 opponents Spain on penalties 4-3 after extra-time had ended 1-1. After dominating possession at the start of the match, Spain opened the scoring in the 11th minute thanks to an own goal from Sergei Ignashevich. Despite Spain continuing to control proceedings, there was little in the way of attacking threat from the 2010 champions. And Russia made them pay in the 39th minute when Gerard Pique handled the ball in the area. Up stepped Artem Dzyuba to draw the teams level at 1-1 with a perfectly taken penalty. The second half saw Spain continue to dominate possession with the hosts living off scraps. Andreas Inestia, controversially left on the bench at the start of the match, came closest with a rasping shot which was saved by Igor Akinfeev. Neither side could find a winner after full-time and the match entered 30 minutes of extra-time. Extra-time followed the same path as regulation time, with Spain launching wave after wave of attack. They though they had penalty with five minutes in the match, with Pique seemingly pulled down in the area. A VAR decision went the way of Russia, however. In the last action of extra-time Rodrigo had a shot on goal saved by Akinfeev but after extra-time the teams were still level at 1-1 and the match would be decided by a penalty shoot-out. At 2-all in the shootout, Koke's penalty was saved by Akinfeev to give the home side at the advantage. Spain remained penalty behind and Akinfeev wrote himself into Russian folklore by saving the last Spanish penalty taken by Iago Aspas. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
