A VILLAGE in central Uganda became the scene of horror and
heartbreak last week when the rotting body of a pregnant woman was discovered
locked in her house. According to Daily
Monitor, the body of Fortunate Hilder Atuhairwe (28) was discovered by outraged
neighbours last Friday. They had become concerned after a terrible smell
started coming out of her locked house in Kihanga village, Kakumiro District. To add to the horror, Fortunate, who already had two
kids, was eight-and-a-half months pregnant. Cops believe her 40-year-old husband is behind the evil
deed and are currently hunting for him. It is believed the couple’s relationship was ruined by
the husband’s violent behaviour, ending in the tragic deaths. Fortunate’s body has been handed over to relatives to be
buried.
