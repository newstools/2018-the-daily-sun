NEW Polokwane City FC head coach Josef Vukusic says he is impressed with the commitment and attitude his players have shown in their pre-season camp. The Slovakian mentor joined the Absa Premiership side on a four-year contract last month, the Limpopo side replacing Bernard Molekwa who is now working as his assistant. And the 53-year-old has been with the team for only three weeks but is already optimistic that they will have a strong squad this season. “We have been working on our fitness and tactics, and I am pleased with the dedication the boys have shown,” said the former National First Division Cape Town City FC coach. “I also never thought the team would adapt to my philosophy this fast and it makes me happy. “They are responding well and I believe we will have a good team which will do better this coming season. I also love the fact we are working as a family. We want our fans to enjoy our style of play.” He added: “Even the new players are adapting fast and are already feeling at home, as I do.” So far, Rise and Shine have signed Bongani Manavhela, Lehlohonolo Nhlapo, Themba Chauke, Khayalethu Mjoli, Tebogo Kalake, Mseleki Mvalo and Mohammed Anas. “We have a good squad already but we will decide before the season starts if we have to add more players,” said Vukusic. “If we are to add, we will just add one or two players. We have not decided yet. “To be honest, I believe this team is already capable of achieving our goals next season.” Reports have linked the Limpopo side with the former Platinum Stars defender Charles Baloyi.
