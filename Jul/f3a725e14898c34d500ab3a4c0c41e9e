LIMPOPO Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba says her department is working hard to put an end to new HIV/Aids infections in the province. Ramathuba was speaking at a graduation ceremony for nurses trained in the initiation and management of anti-retroviral treatment. The ceremony was held at Bolivia Lodge outside Polokwane on Thursday. The MEC gave a thumbs up to programme’s top six graduates. She encouraged the nurses to provide high quality service. “We want our graduates to ensure the people of Limpopo live long and healthy lives,” she said. Ramathuba said 95% of the people who signed up for the programme passed. She said the pass rate was a good sign for the department. “The graduates’ job is to ensure that HIV-positive people who are taking ARVs live healthily.” Ramathuba said since the department launched the programme in 2010, a large number of HIV-positive patients have been transferred from hospitals to primary healthcare facilities. “The programme has played a significant role in increasing the life expectancy of HIV-positive people. “It has also improved the accessibility of ARVs at universities and correctional service centres.” Ramathuba said HIV-positive people in Limpopo will continue to receive ARVs because the department is committed to promoting healthy living. “We want 90% of people to receive HIV treatment by 2020. “The department appreciates the fact that HIV-positive people in Limpopo are committed to taking their medication.”
