WITH most of Polokwane and Seshego’s water reservoirs at 0%, Polokwane Municipality urges people to use water sparingly. People are warned only to use water for domestic purposes, due to low dam levels and the shutdown of the Ebenezer water supply. The municipality is involving Lepelle Northern Water to ensure the supply is restored. Polokwane mayor Thembi Nkadimeng urged residents not to waste water, warning that those found watering their gardens would be given a spot fine. “Lepelle has to carry out a forced shutdown of the Ebenezer plant due to a growing leak in the main line. Maintenance had to be held back due to a stoppage at Olifantspoort. “If the leak increases, it will create serious shortages. All areas supplied from this line will be affected, including Mamabolo, Mankweng and the city.” People are urged to co-operate and use water tankers sent to their areas. Dalmada and Seshego water plants are temporarily open for people to collect water for domestic use. Limpopo Water reported dam levels are showing a serious decrease compared to last year and head of department Lesiba Tloubatla said people should save water.
