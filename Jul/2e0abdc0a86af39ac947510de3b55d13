THE baby mama of alleged serial rapist, Mapule Sekete, told the court that her lover, Khutso Mailoane (30), was not a dangerous person. She was speaking in the Joburg High Court, where the father of her two children is facing 44 counts of rape, 41 of kidnapping and 44 counts of robbery and assault. “He did not commit the crimes because I satisfied him in bed. How is it possible that one person can rape so many people? I deny it,” she said Mailoane pleaded not guilty to all charges. Sekete claimed in court that investigating officer Othusitse Saaiman wanted money from her to clear her boyfriend. She said Saaiman also told her that the DNA samples were tampered with. According to the state, Mailoane committed at least 44 cases of rape that were positively linked to him through DNA testing. “Saaiman told me to raise R50 000 which he would give to blood sample analysts who would then give him the correct results,” she said. Sekete said she raised R10 000 which she gave to him but Saaiman called and demanded another R10 000. She said she was able to get R5 000 which she deposited at Shoprite. “When I realised that what Saaiman was doing was illegal, I recorded our phone calls,” she said. The recording was played in court. Judgment is expected today.
