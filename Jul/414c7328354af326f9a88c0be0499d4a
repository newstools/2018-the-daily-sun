SASSA employees who belong to the Public Servants Association of South Africa have vowed not to go back to work until the employer gives in to their demands. About 1 000 employees marched in the streets of Pietermaritzburg CBD, in the KZN Midlands, before submitting their memorandum of demands to the Sassa head office on Monday. Public Servants Association acting provincial manager, Perfect Zulu, said they decided to deliver the memorandum because salary negotiations couldn’t proceed last month. “We are here because the employer was served with our demands where we clearly stated that we wanted 15% and a housing allowance but the employer did not table anything so we decided to post a dispute on 8 June,” said Zulu. He said when the employer did not resond, they decided to march because they had given Sassa enough time to engage with them. “The strike is going to continue indefinitely because our members have vowed not to go back to work until Sassa goes back to the negotiating table and address their demands.” An employee said: “The working conditions are not conducive. We are doing a very challenging job and the work load is huge yet the money we are paid is not enough. “Petrol and food prices have hiked and we are unable to take care of our families.” Another employee said: “We’re not happy in our offices. They have introduced a biometric system where we’re required to verify identities of the applicants but when we check the workplan, there is no clear biometric option. It takes about 30 minutes to verify one person and when the system fails, we are the ones who take the blame.” Sassa regional manager, Pearl Bhengu, said: “We will take the memorandum to the minister of social development because this is a national matter.”
