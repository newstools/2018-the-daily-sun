THERE’S no business as usual at the Joburg Metro Police. The police department’s chief, David Tembe, was speaking at the official announcement of the new shift system for Metro cops yesterday. Tembe was joined by MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun and Ntombi Khumalo, MMC for corporate and shared services. The new shift will see over 1 800 cops switch to a four-day work on and a four-day work off schedule. Within these shifts, the first two days run from 6am to 6pm, followed by two night duties lasting from 6pm to 6am. The new system started on Sunday. Before the new system was introduced, cops’ day shifts lasted from 6am to 3.30pm‚ the night shift from 3pm to 11.30pm and an all-night shift from 11.30pm to 7am. Authorities said the old system led to fatigue and health related illnesses. “Since 2002, our officers have been crying out for help in terms of the shift system. They work under extremely stressful conditions and it affects their health,” said Khumalo. Tembe said some officers set up their own road blocks without permission in order to take bribes. “It all boils down to their commanders. If the leadership is not doing their job, we will hold them accountable. “We are going to deal harshly with officers who tarnish the badge. Meanwhile, Khumalo said the City of Joburg will get more security guards over the next few weeks. The city hired 1 600 guards over the weekend. The new guards were appointed to full-time positions with medical aid and housing benefits.
