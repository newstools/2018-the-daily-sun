National First Division (NFD) side the University of Pretoria FC have parted ways with head coach Shaun Bartlett. The club announced the news on its official Twitter account that Bartlett had left the club ending a two year spell at the helm.  The 45-year-old former Bafana Bafana international took over at the club in January 2016 when he replaced the outgoing Sammy Troughton. "We have amicably parted ways with Shaun Bartlett, and have in the meantime, appointed Evangelos Vellios as the interim head coach ahead of the 2018/2019 season," the club said.
