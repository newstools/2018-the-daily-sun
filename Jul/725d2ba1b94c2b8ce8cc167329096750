WHEN gogo Lena Seemule turns 100 in October, there needn’t be a huge fanfare or red carpets rolled out for dignitaries. Gogo said that just as Madiba is celebrated, she hopes she won’t be forgotten. Her only wish for her 100th birthday is to have the dignity of living in a house. She said she would be the happiest person ever and her soul would rest in peace. Lena hails from Mmametlhake in Mpumalanga. She has lived a life of hardship in her shack and fears she will never see a proper roof over her head. She shares her shack with fire wood and fears the shack will collapse on her at any time. The gogo said her shack held good memories. “Make no mistake, I love my home – there is no place like home. I’ve lived here almost all my life and I will not move,” she said. Her grandchild Maria Mokgolo (50) said gogo Lena was attached to her shack. “She loves this shack. She has lived here before I was born. It is no longer in good condition and we also fear for her safety,” she said. But they couldn’t afford to build her a house. “If I could I would build her a house but I can’t and it hurts me,” she said. The family hopes Lena’s birthday wish will come true. “We hope someone will help our gogo and that she finally has a proper house,” said Maria.
