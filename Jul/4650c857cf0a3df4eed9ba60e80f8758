IT was at an after tears party that Kristy Williams (22)
lost her life. About 50 mourners drank, danced and watched football on
TV late into the night, as just metres away in a bedroom, Kristy lay dead or
dying from a single stab wound. The 21st June this year was the fifteenth
anniversary of the tragedy. And the person responsible for her death is yet to
be bust. According to Sydney
Morning Herald, Kristy’s mum, Cathy Ryan, and 80 others returned to the
Erambie Aboriginal Mission in Cowra, New South Wales, Australia last weekend to
mark the anniversary. Cathy remains heartbroken that her daughter died so young
and so tragically. She also believes that the aboriginal community in which
her daughter died knows who it is, but are protecting the murderer. “I think they all know what happened, I don’t know how
they sleep. One person would have done it, and the rest are covering," she
told The Herald. “Someone, somewhere in this community knows what
happened. We need them to come forward.” Cathy has decided to move back to Cowra, a town she had
lived in for five years before her daughter’s murder. “I need to come back, to be with Kristy. It’s time. “People are going to have to face me every day. See how
that will get them,” she said. She may not know who did it, but Cathy thinks she knows
why. "I don’t think they meant to kill her, but they
wanted to hurt her. Jealousy is the only thing I can put it down to.” She also thinks cops could have done more to solve the
mystery. “My daughter’s worth more. She did drink and I know that,
she’s not perfect, she’s like most young girls. I think the cops just looked at
her as she’s Indigenous, on a mission, she partied and they didn’t care,” said Cathy. Cop Scott Cook said: “It is also frustrating for police
that this remains unsolved after 15 years and we have not yet brought justice
for Kristy. “All victim families deserve answers and we are committed
to providing answers to more families.”
