TODAY is World Penis Day. While most men are accused of thinking with their penises, they’re now being encouraged to think about their 4-5s. An investigation by underwear brand Frankees, in collaboration with the South African Pelvic Research Organisation On Body Empowerment, showed there’s lots more to having a 4-5 than meets the eye. The brand and research laboratory conducted a survey of 217 men in Cape Town, Joburg, Durban and Tshwane. The survey touched on testicular location and preferences related to circumcision. The men were also asked questions about prostate wellness. According to the research, 5% of males’ testicles are positioned to the right when they relax. It was also discovered that 48% of men from Joburg and Tshwane preferred to position their testicles to the left. The survey found that 53% of males surveyed across the country had undergone circumcision. The research states that 70% of men in Durban are circumcised. Joburg stuck its neck out at 63%, while Cape Town sat at 52%. Tshwane came in last as only 25% of its men have had the snip. When it comes to testicular health, the majority of men in all cities said they hadn’t had their prostates checked. The participants were asked whether size matters, and 65% said it doesn’t. Of the men surveyed, 54% described the size of their penis as average, with 38% giving their member a 7 out of 10 rating. Factors such as length, shape and width were also considered vital. Women in Mzansi will be glad to hear that men in the country change their underwear every day. Clinical sexologist Dr Marlene Wasserman said men have a “complicated relationship” with their 4-5s. “They consider it a tool to prove their social power and boost their confidence, but they rarely discuss their sexual health,” she said. The survey hopes to encourage men to have honest and serious conversations about their private parts.
