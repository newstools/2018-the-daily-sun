The life of a Limpopo father is in limbo after home affairs
declared him as a Zimbabwean citizen when he went there to reapply for his ID
document. Walter Makamu (33) from Mininginisi outside Giyani told
Daily Sun that his Home Affairs horrors started in 2015 when he went to Randburg
Home Affairs in Joburg to reapply for his ID. He was told by an official that his ID number appeared
like he is from Zimbabwe and he needs to fix it. “After I came back from Gauteng I went to Home Affairs in
Giyani to try to fix the problem but officials are failing to resolve the
matter,” said Makamu. He said it is difficult to him to go to Home Affairs
every time and left there without any help since he doesn’t have money. Makamu said due to the problem he was forced to abandon his
job at a construction site in Joburg because his bosses wanted him to first
sort out the problem with his ID. “I was shocked when they told me that I’m from Zimbabwe
meanwhile I even don’t know the place,” he said . He is afraid his wife will leave him because he is unable
to get a job. Home Affairs spokesperson Thabo Mokgola said he will get
the provincial manager for Home Affairs in Limpopo to investigate.
