FOUR families were left homeless when a strong wind blew their shacks away on Monday. Making matters worse, the residents of Airport squatter camp near Scenery Park, in East London, lost their homes just as temperatures across the country dropped. Nontombi Chakumba (43) told Daily Sun she was at work at about 11am when she received a phone call telling her that her shack had been blown away. “My neighbour has temporarily offered me a place to sleep, but I do not know how I am going to rebuild my shack. I earn only R1 000 a month,” she said. Nontombi said she had been living in a shack since 1997. “There are other places where people lived in shacks, but they now have RDP houses. I don’t understand how this government operates,” she said. “There are more than 700 shacks in this area. Our councillor does not care about us, but when politicians want votes they come here and promise many things. “They take old people to voting stations in a car, but when these same people report a problem, then no one listens.” Nontombi said 92-year-old David Mfazwe died last week while still waiting for an RDP. Lungelwa Dyeyi (29) said some of the zinc sheets on her roof were blown away and she is living in fear. “We do not even have electricity. We have to make illegal connections because we cannot afford to buy paraffin,” she said. Councillor Zandisile Tokwe urged residents to be patient as the squatter camp had been selected for an upgrade programme. “No one can say I do not care. I listen to all the problems of the people,” said Tokwe.
