SUSPENDED ANC member Thabang Setona appeared in the Joburg Magistrates Court yesterday. Setona, who made headlines when he was photographed kicking gogo Olivia Makete in February, appeared on an assault charge. His case was postponed to 15 August. Makete was photographed lying on the ground and trying to get her balance at a protest as Setona kicked her in the ribs. It happened during a clash between Black First Land First members and a group called Defenders of Luthuli House at the ANC’s Joburg headquarters. The gogo’s family was in court to support her yesterday. Her husband Robert told Daily Sun his wife was healthy and strong before the incident but that has changed. “She could carry a bucket of water but now she can’t. She was selling chicken feet but hasn’t been able to do anything as she is still injured,” he said. Nephew Sizek Nghulele said his aunt just wanted justice. Setona’s actions were condemned after the photos appeared in the media and the party suspended him. After a national outcry, he handed himself over to cops and Makete, from Orange Farm near Joburg, was showered with gifts from well wishers.
