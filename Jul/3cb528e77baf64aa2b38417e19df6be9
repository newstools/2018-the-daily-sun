THE last thing Tatenda Hwami remembers about Wednesday night was the sound of his one-year-old daughter crying. The 24-year-old from Graveyard in De Doorns, Cape Town, said three of his loved ones died from smoke inhalation. Tatenda said he and his family made a fire earlier that day and took the burning coals indoors. “It was cold and we wanted our house to be warm. “Then I heard my one-year-old daughter crying at about 11pm. “It sounded like my daughter was suffocating. “When I woke up I had a terrible headache and it was difficult for me to open my eyes.” Tatenda said he passed out soon after telling his brother to wake up. When Tatenda woke up in hospital, he was told his wife, daughter and brother were dead. “I am thankful to God that I survived, but what about my daughter and wife? “How will I be able to live without them? “I’ve asked God to give me strength to get through this situation. “Accepting what happened is going to be hard.” Stephen Gaxa (49), Tatenda’s cousin, said the family has a lot of questions. “This is confusing. Neither the house nor the dead were burnt,” said Stephen. He said the family needs help to bury their dead relatives. “We were not ready for this tragedy. The family would appreciate some help.” Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: “An inquest docket has been registered following the death of two adults and one child in De Doorns.”
