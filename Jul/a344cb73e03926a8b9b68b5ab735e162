BLACK Leopards manager Tshifhiwa Thidiela has assured their fans that their Absa Premiership Limpopo derby against Polokwane City on Saturday (6pm) will be played at Thohoyandou Stadium, not Peter Mokaba Stadium. Leopards fans were surprised when they discovered that their opening fixture was apparently no longer taking place in their backyard. Even though Leopards’ home venue was recently upgraded to meet the required PSL standard, the fixture list stated that the game would take place in Polokwane. But Thidiela told SunSport yesterday the fans could rest assured and should not worry. This will be the Venda side’s first top flight match since the club got relegated five seasons ago. “We are playing Polokwane City at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday, we’re not taking this game to Polokwane,” said Thidiela. “We have said it before, we will use Thohoyandou Stadium as our home venue – and that is exactly what we will do for our fans.” Thulamela Municipality’s manager for sports and culture, Nditsheni Makhadzi, said the stadium was ready to host a PSL game. “The municipality has made all the necessary upgrades the PSL asked for. PSL inspectors were supposed to have checked the upgrades last week but did not show up. Instead they called us to say they were heading to Cape Town to inspect a stadium there. “So we are still waiting for them (PSL inspectors) but our stadium is ready to host Saturday’s game.” The PSL inspectors are expected in Limpopo this week. Added Makhadzi: “The pitch is ready, the lights are in good working order for night games. All our efforts have gone into meeting the deadline and ensuring the stadium is up to standard.” Leopards coach Joel Masutha, who is in charge of a PSL side for the first time, says they aim to collect as many points early in the season, especially at home where they will have the support of thousands of fans.
