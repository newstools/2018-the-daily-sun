WHEN her mum dressed her 10-month-old daughter and took pictures of her on Monday, little did she know they were the last pictures she’d have of her. Amogelang Morwakane from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni died at creche on Wednesday, allegedly while being fed. Grandmother Veronica Boshielo (40) said she got a call from Amogelang’s mum Rachel (27). “She told me the creche called her and asked her to rush there. “I then decided to call the creche myself to find out what was happening and they told me the baby was not feeling well, but she was fine, so I should rush there,” Veronica said. She said she and her sister went to the creche. “When we got there, we saw ambulances outside and I asked my sister to go in first, because I sensed something was terribly wrong. “The look on her face when she came to fetch me just said it all. When I walked inside the house, I saw a tiny body on the floor covered in foil. “The worst was confirmed,” Veronica said. She said when she asked the creche staff what had happened, none of them had a clear answer. “This is what makes me angry. We know that mistakes happen. Maybe Amogelang’s time on earth was up. “But why are they not honest with us? “How come no one really knows what happened, including the person who was feeding her? “We need answers. Her mum is not coping at all.” Captain Nomsa Sekele of Daveyton police said: “If a child dies at creche, an inquest case is opened and investigations take place. “We are waiting for the post mortem and if any foul play is suspected, the case will be changed and a suspect will be charged,” Sekele said.
