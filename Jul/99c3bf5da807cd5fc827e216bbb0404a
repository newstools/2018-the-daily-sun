WATER Minister Gugile Nkwinti met Eastern Cape mayors on Wednesday. He spoke to Sarah Baartman Mayor Eunice Kekana and Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip to discuss the province’s water crisis. Mayors from local municipalities in the Sarah Baartman district also attended the meeting, called as dam levels across the province have dropped drastically. Numerous towns are at risk of running out of water. Sarah Baartman Municipality, which is one of the major agricultural economic regions in the country, is facing water shedding and this will have an economic effect on the entire country. Nelson Mandela Bay has announced stricter water restrictions as dam levels have dropped to 19,27%. Kekana said: “In the midst of water-saving efforts, clean water is still being washed down the drain in our municipalities due to ageing infrastructure and vandalism of infrastructure. Those are our main challenges.” Trollip said there were about 48 000 houses that did not have water meters, making it difficult for the municipality to measure whether residents were adhering to water restrictions. “Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality will be putting measures in place to address this issue,” he said. Nkwinti advised Nelson Mandela Bay to further increase its water restrictions. “The Nooitgedacht water project should be prioritised to address water challenges in these areas,” he said. “People are relying heavily on surface water and need to look to other options.”
