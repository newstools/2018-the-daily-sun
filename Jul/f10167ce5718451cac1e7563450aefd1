Local actress Thuso Mbedu turned 27 years old not too long ago, and in celebration, she recently had birthday party. And of course, the party appears to have been a whole lot of fun for her and some of her close friends and family. The onetime Emmy Award nominee was kind enough to give the rest of us a glimpse into her fun filled party through videos and pictured shared on social media. Her co star on Saints and Sinners Nthathi Moshesh and her best friend Makgotso M, were among those in attendance.
