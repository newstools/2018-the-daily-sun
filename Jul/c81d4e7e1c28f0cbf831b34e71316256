RESIDENTS of Umuziwabantu Municipality in southern KZN said they fear Day Zero may be fast approaching. They said their taps are running dry and are calling on the municipality to come up with solutions. KwaMachi resident Sipho Ntombela (47) said his village has been without water for a month. “The municipality sends tankers but we are struggling because they come once a week. Sometimes a week passes by without them supplying us with water.” Nomalanga Hlatshwayo (53) from KwaMbotho Village said it is sad to see gogos fetching water from the river. “The municipality knows of the situation but we don’t know what they are doing to solve it. “We wish something could be done soon before it is too late. We last had water last month.” DA MP Rishigen Viranna said they held an oversight inspection of water in the municipality last Tuesday and things didn’t look good. “The municipality must be declared a disaster area. It needs help for the sake of the residents, because they are suffering,” he said. Mayor Dixie Nciki confirmed the water shortage. “We are dealing with it and assure residents there will be no Day Zero. We are speaking to stakeholders to find solutions,” said Nciki.
