THE town came to a standstill as men marched against women and child abuse. The marchers were mostly men from the police, emergency services, prison wardens and firefighters. The march was held in Rustenburg yesterday. The men were also joined by some women who wanted to add their voices to the fight against abuse. Amos Magasa, Rustenburg public safety superintendent, said they wanted to promote the #Notinmyname movement, which calls for men to teach their sons respect for women. “We want to take this campaign into homes and target 100 men to change their behaviour,” said Amos. MMC for Public Safety, Michael Mhlungu, said young boys must be taught how to treat women. “We must build a nation that knows how to take care of each other. Our women are getting killed and our kids are going missing. Some women are killed for being in politics. We need tolerance and to fight for equality between men and women.”
