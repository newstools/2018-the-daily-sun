FOR about a year, prison authorities ignored the video of prisoners injecting themselves with drugs. But now, following a Daily Sun media inquiry, the department of correctional services said it was immediately starting an internal investigation led by a senior manager. In video taken at the prison in the south of Joburg known as Sun City, prisoners are recorded injecting drugs into an inmate’s arm using a syringe. The inmates claim cops bring the drugs into the prison. They also believe top management is benefiting from the drugs being brought into the prison. In a written response, the department’s Gauteng spokesman Mocheta Monama said the investigation is ongoing and will also find ways to minimise the recurrence of similar incidents. “Drugs and other illegal smuggled items are one of the major challenges the department faces,” he said. “Relevant security strategies are currently being put in place to confiscate and prevent unauthorised items from entering our prisons.” He said daily searches are conducted in and around the facilities to remove and prevent unauthorised items. Monama said the department was also working with other government departments, NGOs and relevant service providers to provide solutions regarding substance abuse and other health issues. “It is a criminal offence to bring any illegal item into a correctional facility as they are a serious risk to the life of other offenders and correctional officials.” “Family members and friends of inmates must not bring prohibited items into our facilities.” He said they will show no tolerance on drug use, be it on the part of offenders or visitors. “Any inmate caught with illegal goods faces not only a loss of privileges but also additional criminal charges which may result in an additional term of imprisonment. Members of the public will face criminal charges if caught,” he said.
