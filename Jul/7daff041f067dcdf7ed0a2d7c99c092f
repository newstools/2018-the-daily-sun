THE South African Human Rights Commission paid a surprise visit to Jubilee Hospital in Hammanskraal, Tshwane yesterday. This was after residents protested last week, complaining about dirty water and bad service at the hospital. But hospital management said they had never treated any cases of cholera. Buang Jones, manager of the commission in Gauteng, said they were there to see if there was any truth to the allegations made against the hospital. He said they would assess the information they got and determine if they should conduct a full investigation or an inquiry. “Among the allegations is that workers are rude to patients, that there’s not enough staff, and there is a shortage of medication and ambulances. “We are not on a witch hunt, but are trying to work with the hospital to find a solution to their problems. “We have visited other hospitals and investigations are ongoing. “We will also visit other hospitals in our quest to find solutions,” Jones told Daily Sun. Hospital CEO Damaria Magano said they appreciated the commission’s visit. She said false allegations against the hospital affected staff morale. “The hospital is in a very populated area and close to the N1. Twenty-two clinics in North West refer patients to us, as well as 11 clinics.” She said the hospital was the biggest in the area, but had limited resources. “If we had resources, complaints would be minimised. “We also have a shortage of doctors,” she said. Mamoloko Molontoa (50), who was at the hospital for a check up, said the nurses were strangely friendly yesterday. She said even though she understood that there was a shortage of staff, she thought some workers used that as an excuse for laziness. “The commission should send their officials regularly to the hospital,” said Mamoloko.
