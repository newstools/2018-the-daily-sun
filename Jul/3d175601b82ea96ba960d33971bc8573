SPARKS were flying in Bloemfontein on Monday. No, it was not a service delivery protest. This time the sparks were flying on the business end of welding rods as pupils from all over the Free State took part in a welding competition. The first of its kind in the province, the competition seeks to profile and highlight the importance of technical and agricultural schools, and their contribution to bridging the gap of scarce technical skills. The competition was held at SA Truck Bodies. It was open to grade 10 and 11 pupils who are studying mechanical and agricultural technology, in particular welding and metalwork. The competition also seeks to open doors of opportunities in the sector for girl child. Of the 407 pupils from 34 schools who participated, several were girls. Free State education head Tsoarelo Malakoane said after a knockout competition, the 14 best welders were identified. Malakoane added that they wanted to create more interest in welding as a career. “The reality is that children are not the same and not all of them are going to do well in the academic streams. “There is a skills shortage and education has to respond to the industry. There is no point in educating a lot of matriculants for them to sit at home doing nothing,” he said. “If we truly want to fight the burden of unemployment and poverty that is destroying our country, the idea is for them to be relevant in various industries.” Puleng Khatsi (17), a grade 10 pupil from Barnard Molokoane Comprehensive School in Parys, said: “I am over the moon about winning second prize. The competition was tough but I didn’t lose my focus. “I’m happy to have made my school proud.”
