EMERGENCY service workers had their hands full at a shopping centre in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni yesterday. They battled to put out a fire that started in one of the shops. Ekurhuleni Disaster and Emergency Management Services spokesman William Ntladi said they don’t know what caused the fire, which started at about 8am. He said it was a good thing that the shopping centre was right opposite a fire station. “As far as we know the fire started in one of the shops. We are going to investigate what caused the fire,” said Ntladi. “Three shops were burnt to the ground. We had about eight fire engines on the scene.” He said that no casualties were reported and they managed to extinguish the fire.
