Soweto Giants Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates have both unveiled their new Home and Away kits for the upcoming 2018/2019 PSL season. Both clubs have maintained their historic traditional colours on both their Home jerseys while experimenting with a few elements as well. For their Away jersey, Pirates in partnership with their sponsor Adidas have gone back to their striped pattern. Kaizer Chiefs and Nike on the other hand have experimented with a strong royal purple colour for their away jersey. Amakhosi will take to the field in their new kit for the first time when they take on Mamelodi Sundowns in the Shell Helix Ultra Cup this weekend.
