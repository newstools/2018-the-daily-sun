This winter has really shown us flames when it comes to colours bursting everywhere. In the past, colours were always a summer thing, but that's changed this year and we're living for it. One the latest trends and certainly not for everyone are white boots. White boots really remind me of the 60s, in the days of the London based model Twiggy. Now as mentioned this trend isn't for everyone. However there are a few things that you can do to make wearing white boots easier and manageable. You can pair your white boots with any denim or pencil skirt. See pictures below of this trend: All the way from #Tokyo!!! @alldayvegan is looking as fabulous as ever in her Ivory Blondie heels! . . #comfyheels #ecolux #sustainabledesign #Veganshoes #veganfashion #veganstyle #ethicalfashion #pursuepretty #sheisnotlost #ethicalfashionblogger #fashiondesign #shoedesign #veganleather #vegaynsofig #veganlife #crueltyfree #sotd #sustainabledesign #ecofashionblog #ecochic #comfyheels #veganblog #vegansofig #madeinspain #summerwhite #whiteboots #cutout #femaleentrepreneur A post shared by  BHAVA (@bhavastudio) on Jul 3, 2018 at 4:44am PDT    New in?????????????
