IN A dream on Monday Naledi Sabata saw flames eating her family alive. Then when she woke up she realised her bedroom was full of smoke! The 18-year-old woke her sister Zukiswa (33) and her two kids aged five and 13, when she saw their room covered in flames. Luckily the family from Kutlwanong kasi in Odendaalsrus, Free State managed to flee the fire. However, their two-roomed shack was burned to ashes. Zukiswa told Daily Sun: “We usually pray before we go to sleep, but this time we did not. We were all asleep when I heard Naledi screaming that the shack was on fire. When I woke up, there was smoke everywhere.” Zukiswa said she managed to kick the door open and get her two kids out while Naledi stayed in the shack. “I went back in with a wet blanket and rescued her. She said she tried to get out through the door, but it was burning so she could not open it.” Zukiswa said neighbours tried to douse the fire but the flames were too strong. “Residents claim it was vutha, but I can’t think who would want to do this to me as I am not rich. We have been left stranded and sleeping at relatives’ homes,” she said. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said no case was opened. “The victim should report the matter,” he said.
