PROPHET Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng says he wants to do more to help others. Speaking at a media briefing at his church in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni yesterday, Mboro said he and iCollege would be giving 2 000 scholarships worth R42 000 to deserving young people. The Incredible Happenings Ministry leader said his work had brought him into contact with many young people in need of spiritual and financial help. “The plight of our youth touched me. “I understand the youth are important,” he said. “We are always preaching that the youth are our future, but we forget about the role the youth play right now in our present.” Mboro said he wanted to do something for young people as part of his #Mboro50 celebrations. “My biggest wish is to help youth reach their goals by furthering their studies,” he said. “We are talking about getting land, but we need educated youth who will know what to do with the land when we have it. “I went out to look for partners who would help me achieve this goal of educating our youth. Luckily, iCollege said they would help.” The college’s spokesman, Neo Kuaho, said: “We saw that this is a match made in heaven. “We are all about empowering the youth, so we decided to heed Prophet Mboro’s call.” Mboro also offered to pay for the registration of 2 000 applicants and to support students with things such as transport and accommodation. “I am not only excited about getting these students to college. I am looking forward to keeping them in college,” Mboro said. Xoliswa Ndlovu (20), one of the recipients, said she was over the moon when she heard she would be getting help. “I cannot thank Prophet Mboro enough. I finished school in 2016 and I have been sitting at home since then,” she told Daily Sun. “Now I will able to study nursing as I have always wanted.” The scholarships are open to anyone with grade 10, 11 or matric, between the ages of 18 and 27 and is a South African citizen with an ID.
