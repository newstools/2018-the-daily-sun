A 3-year-old toddler has died after he allegedly fell into a pit toilet in Seshego. The police say the tragic incident occurred on Wednesday, at Moletji Diteteng near Knobel Hospital. Police spokesperson Constable Maphure Manamela said it is alleged that the little boy went to his aunt's place across the street, where he usually plays. Manamela said the aunt took off his clothes and left him to relieve himself outside the toilet as she usually did. “She was busy with her house chores when she noticed she had not seen the toddler for some time,” Manamela said. "She searched for him without success until she reported the matter to the Police.” According to Manamela they responded quickly and a search operation commenced until the boy was found inside the pit toilet. The Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has warned parents and guardians to be vigilant at all times to avoid this type of incidents from re-occurring.
