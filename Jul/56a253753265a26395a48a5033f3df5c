WHAT started as a welcome development for residents has turned into a nightmare. The people of Motherwell in Port Elizabeth told Daily Sun they were so happy when they heard the municipality was going to repair Tyinira Street that they started ululating. However, the street, which was full of potholes, has been left in a worse state by the contractor. Residents said the excavated road was left with no barriers and a deep trench and they feared it was putting their lives at risk. They complained the contractor had not bothered to put up signs to warn motorists of the danger posed by the road and a number of vehicles were damaged. Resident Anelisa Marko (33) said she drove into the trench on Tuesday night and her car’s front bumper was buckled. “I was coming home from working a night shift when I drove on to the gravel road. “I was not aware there was construction ahead,” she said. “The trench is very deep and my car got stuck in it. My passengers had to get out of the car and pull it out of the trench. “There are no sign posts or barriers to warn motorists of the danger ahead. This is dangerous and whoever is responsible for the construction of this road should be charged with negligence.” The part of the road under construction is about 80m long and the deepest part of the trench is more than a metre deep. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “The infrastructure and engineering department will investigate all these claims. “If the company is found to be at fault, it will be instructed to remedy the situation.”
