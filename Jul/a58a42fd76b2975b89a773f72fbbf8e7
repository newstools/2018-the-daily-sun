THE mayor of Sol Plaatje Municipality Mangaliso Matika refuses to
leave office. Matika was given the boot on Wednesday last week, after a motion
of no confidence by opposition parties in the Northern Cape. This after gatvol residents wanted the mayor out, and protests flared
in the area. The mayor says he won’t leave office until proper processes are
followed. Residents also called for the chief financial officer, Lydia
Mahloko and the municipal manager, Goolam Akhawaray, to step down. Mahloko and Akharwaray have been suspended following the violent
protests. DA provincial leader Andrew Louw said last week: “We have long
fought for Matika’s removal as mayor as he has shown time and again he’s not
fit to lead the municipality. “We welcome the support we received from councillors of the EFF,
the Freedom Front Plus and the ANC.” Louw said service delivery collapsed under Matika’s leadership. “We call on the new mayor, Pule Thabane, to avoid errors that his
predecessor made.”
