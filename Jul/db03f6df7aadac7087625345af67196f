KENNETH Sedibe no longer enjoys a peaceful life at home. This is because of an awful stench coming from a nearby blocked drain. The 62-year-old from D2 in Mamelodi West, Tshwane said he hasn’t been able to enjoy a meal with his family since last Friday because of the smell. “This is very bad and I have reported the matter to the municipality but nothing has been done about it.” Kenneth told Daily Sun his neighbours were also suffering as filthy water flowed in front of their houses, making the whole area stink. He said they worried the water would make their children sick. The blocked drain has also been affecting pupils at nearby Dr Monare Primary School. “The worst thing is that kak water has invaded my shack and I can’t even close the door and windows because of the smell,” said Kenneth. He said he had to make sure all the doors and windows were closed while he was cooking. “I miss fresh air.” Councillor Percy Zitha said he was aware of the matter and had reported it to the municipal department that deals with sewage.
