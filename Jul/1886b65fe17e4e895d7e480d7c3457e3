Tributes have been pouring from around Mzansi after renowned cardiologist Professor Bongani Mayosi’s death last week. Mayosi died on Friday (27 July). He is believed to have committed suicide. Mayosi (51) was born in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, and obtained two medical degrees at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. He worked as an intern at Livingstone Hospital in Port Elizabeth and joined the University of Cape Town in 1992. Mayosi received the county's highest honour, the Order of Mapungubwe (Silver), in 2009. He was the Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Cape Town and an A-rated National Research Foundation researcher. He was also head of the Department of Medicine at the University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital. His family is also in the medical field: his father was a medical doctor and so is his wife. He was known for research topics like rheumatic fever, tuberculous pericarditis and cardiomyopathy. He was a member of the Academy of Science of South Africa and a former President of the College of Physicians of South Africa. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa extended his condolences to Mayosi’s family. “His death is indeed an enormous loss not only to his family but to the country as a whole,” he said. “On behalf of government and South Africans as a whole, we convey our most heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and relatives, and the health science fraternity. May his soul rest in peace,” President Ramaphosa said.
