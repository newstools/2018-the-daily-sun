PARENTS are gatvol of the principal of Finetown Primary School in Ennerdale, south of Joburg and they want him to resign with immediate effect. They believe he’s involved in the recent cases of theft and vandalism at the school. The parents claim that some SGB members, security guards, the deputy principal and the principal are organising break-ins. CPF chairwoman Minkie Makgabane (50) told Daily Sun that last Sunday at about 7pm, a patroller brought in a boy he’d caught stealing at her house. “This was not the first time the 17-year-old has been brought to me. Parents had previously threatened to beat him to death if he continued with his ways. But he confessed something I had never thought possible,” she said. “He told me he had been given access to the school by a security guard who got orders from the deputy principal. He said he stole food and some educational material to sell at creches. He said he got between R100 and R200 every time he stole from the school.” Makgabane said the principal never bothered to open a case when there was a break-in and only opened one last week because parents forced him to do so. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “The community is demanding the suspension of the people implicated and a case has been opened with the police. We beg the community to allow investigations to continue without interruption. A follow-up meeting will be held in seven days.”
