A GROUP of thugs robbed a municipal building in the early hours of yesterday morning. The thugs pounced on security guards at the Leslie Monnanyane Municipal building in Kagisanong kasi, Free State, and stole an undisclosed amount of cash. A guard said four armed men attacked the guards at about 1am. “The guards’ hands were tied and they were locked in the toilet,” said the guard. “The guards said they could hear the sound of a grinder and hammers being used in the area where the safe is kept. “When they finally managed to phone the police a few hours later, the suspects had already fled. “The men were armed with what appeared to be 9mm pistols.” When the SunTeam arrived at the scene, the bomb squad, a fire truck, ambulance and cops were in the vicinity. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said the suspects covered their faces and the guards were unlikely to be able to identify them. She said police arrived on the scene at about 5am. “The suspects gained entry through a a broken window,” said Mbambo. “No one has been arrested yet and no injuries were reported.” Qondile Khedama, a spokesman for the municipality, said they’d tighten security at the building. “One of our security guards managed to call the police. “Fortunately, there were no fatalities or injuries. “We requested staff to vacate the building and let the police do their job.”
