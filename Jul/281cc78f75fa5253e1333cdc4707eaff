DOCTORS and nurses at Limpopo’s Seshego Hospital had to be on their toes when they helped a young mother deliver her babies. That’s because, to their surprise and the mother, it wasn’t just one baby, or two . . . but three little bundles of joy. MEC for Health Dr Phophi Ramathuba visited the beaming mum and hospital staff yesterday. She showered the mum and her babies with gifts. According to the MEC, the triplet’s mum Kholofelo Mogolola (18) was the youngest woman to give birth to triplets in the province. Ramathuba also expressed her appreciation for the great work done by the hospital’s maternity ward staff to ensure that the young mum gave birth without complications. “This was all through their dedication, passion and commitment and we urge them to continue the great work with all our patients,” said Ramathuba. She told Daily Sun the young mum should be supported. “Together with the departments of home affairs, social development and Sassa, we will ensure that she is assisted with everything she needs for the babies,” she said. Dr Ewan Ikpefan said they were happy with the babies’ delivery. “It is always our duty to ensure that our patients are successfully assisted and get the treatment they deserve,” he said. Kholofelo said she was happy to have the triplets even though she wasn’t expecting three babies. “They are a gift from God and I will look after them,” she said.
