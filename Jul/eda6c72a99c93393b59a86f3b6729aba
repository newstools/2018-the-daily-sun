LAND invaders at Winnie Mandela squatter camp in Cape Town are suffering. People who started to invade the open space in Khayelitsha three months ago are struggling after heavy rain flooded the area. Even though it was a sunny and warm in Cape Town this weekend, many shacks remain flooded and owners decided to abandon their homes. Lindikhaya Mahanjana (37) said when it rained they couldn’t sleep, because there was water everywhere. “Even though it has not rained for days, some shacks are still standing in water and it’s bad. That is why the owners left the place.” The invaders say when it was raining, no one from the city came to help them. “We saw officials helping out in other places but no one bothered to come and check how we were doing,” they said. They told Daily Sun they still won’t change their minds even though no one offered to help them. “We are here to live, with or without the city’s permission,” said a resident. Nomvuyo Dlamini (48) said maybe the city didn’t help because they were told not to build on the land, but they needed homes so they were forced to invade the space. “Maybe they thought we must just see how to get out of this by ourselves because they told us not to build our structures here. But we needed their help,” she said. Some residents paid R100 for a truckload of sand to prevent water entering their shacks. “We think the treatment we are getting now from everyone is the treatment we will get when it’s election time. We will deal with them because now we need help and no one is willing to help us,” said the invaders.
