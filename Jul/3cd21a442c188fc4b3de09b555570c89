COPS are on the hunt for a gang of armed thugs after gogo Dimakatso Moiloa (85) and her daughter Kirilene Phonoshe (40) were killed. The two women from Thabong in Welkom, Free State, who were apparently mashonisas, were killed in cold blood in separate incidents. The men shot one and attacked the other with a hammer on the same night. Captain Malebo Khosana said: “Cops were called to the first scene on Tuesday night after an 85-year-old woman was struck with a hammer on her head while sleeping with her grandchildren. “Three unknown men believed to be from Lesotho gained entry by damaging the kitchen door and demanded money. “They were armed with a firearm, knife and hammer. “After taking an undisclosed amount of money, the gogo was struck on her head with the hammer and died on the scene. “Cops were called to another murder scene in 2010 Village,” he said. “Police were told a mother of about 40 was asleep with her two children. “The sitting room door was allegedly forced open by two unknown men in possession of firearms and a hammer. “The mum was allegedly shot and an undisclosed amount of money taken. Her son was also struck with a hammer on his right hip. “The youngest survived with no injuries and went to seek help after the suspects fled the scene.” He said the suspects were wearing balaclavas in both attacks. Khosana said two murder cases were opened and no arrests have been made yet. Thabong unit commander Colonel Mzamo Nyamani asked residents to help cops bust the suspects. “Anyone with information can call me on 082 453 0759,” said Nyamani.
