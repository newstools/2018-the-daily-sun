South Africans are standing in solidarity with Skeem Saam actress, Reshoketswe 'Shoki' Sebotsane ahead of her court appearance scheduled for Thursday, 02 August. This as Shoki has laid charges of domestic violence with the intention to do grievous bodily harm against her husband of 11 years, actor, Sello Sebotsane. Shoki’s story first shocked the nation when it broke at the beginning of 2017 after she told Drum magazine that Sello had beaten her “to a pulp”. The matter will now head to court at the Joburg Magistrates Court where both sides will present their arguments. The hashtag #JusticeForShoki is already trending, with women and men calling everyone to go to the court on Thursday and stand not only with Shoki but also against domestic abuse in general. Fellow actress, Florence Masebe is one of the voices who made the call to South Africans. Shoki and Sello will appear at the Joburg Magistrate’s Court on 02 August at 08:30.
