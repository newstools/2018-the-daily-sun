KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said the death of Cacisile Gumede (34) was made even worse by the fact that she died at the hands of a man. Cacisile was shot dead in her home, allegedly by a builder, Sdu Sithole, on Saturday. Sithole was seen in a video shooting himself in the head on Sunday in V Section, Umlazi. “Today we’ve gathered here at the Gumede family home after a horrific incident, in the same month of July when we are trying to spread the word that a few trustworthy men can plant seeds of love so that women and children will be protected,” said Dhlomo. He was speaking in KwaXimba Village in Cato Ridge yesterday when he paid a visit to the family. Gumede worked as a data capturer at Umsunduzi Clinic. Cacisile’s family didn’t want to speak to the media. Reports on Tuesday claimed the two had a dispute after Cacisile allegedly refused to pay Sdu for work done. Apparently Sdu shot and killed Cacisile in anger and then shot himself to avoid arrest. KZN police spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, said a case of murder was being investigated by Umsunduzi police. “The suspect killed himself in Umlazi.”
