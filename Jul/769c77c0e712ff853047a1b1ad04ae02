IF you’ve spent any time in a shebeen, you know how disorderly drunk people can get. In an effort to reduce assault cases in the province, the KZN Liquor Board Authority teamed up with police to raid shebeens. The cops went to Pinetown on Friday before moving on to KwaNyuswa and Ngcolosi on Saturday. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said 29 shebeens were raided. He said five of the shebeen owners were not complying with the rules of their licence. Zwane said nine illegal shebeens were closed and a large amount of alcohol was confiscated. “One person was arrested after being found in possession of R3 500 worth of illegal cigarettes,” said Zwane. “We can’t give figures, but a lot of assaults happen at these shebeens. “Eighteen scrapyards were also raided. “Three of them were not complying with their licence.” Simphiwe Hlophe, a district inspector at the provincial liquor authority, said: “We discovered that a lot of people in KwaNyuswa are selling alcohol without licences. “We wanted to teach shebeen owners how to apply for permits. “Residents were told what criteria need to be satisfied before they obtain permits. “They should start by getting a business licence before filling out application forms. “Then they have to pay a R1 500 lodgement fee. “When that is done, we decide whether or not to grant them a licence. “Whether or not they receive permits, we give them reasons for the outcome of their application.”
