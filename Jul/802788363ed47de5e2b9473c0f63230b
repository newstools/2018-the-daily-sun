WITH the deaths of abakhwetha hanging over the initiation season, it’s a surprise to find someone like Jonathan Paulin (18) at bush school. Jonathan, whose mum is Xhosa but whose dad is white, has been going through the ancient rite of passage to become a man since the past few days. Asked how he convinced his parents, he told Daily Sun: “I reminded them it wasn’t circumcision that killed the initiates but only those who didn’t know how to do it.” Jonathan from Mdantsane NU7 in East London said he was determined to prove that circumcision wasn’t meant to kill abakhwetha. He told the People’s Paper: “I used to visit my mum’s family during school holidays and made friends with Xhosa guys. “One day, I saw my friends eating delicious meat during a traditional function but wasn’t allowed to join them because I was not circumcised. “They called me a boy.” Jonathan said he then decided to become circumcised like them. “I decided to do it the Xhosa way because I like this culture and its traditions. “I told my father that nothing bad would to happen to me. He was very happy to see me healthy when he visited.” He said initiation school taught him a lot. “I now know how a real man should behave. “Apart from that, I ate delicious meat, the right leg of a goat, intsonyama. “I am very happy to be a man. Now other men won’t chase me away from traditional functions. “At home, I sleep on a comfortable bed but I don’t miss it because I’m happy here. I even adopted the name of my mother’s clan. Now I am Leta Mntakwende,” he said. Jonathan’s uncle, Madoda Bekwa (43) told Daily Sun his nephew spoke to him about wanting to go to initiation school. “He is very respectful and behaves. “His surgeon nurse Vuyani Maqethuka never complained about him,” he said. On Saturday, Jonathan will go home a man. The latest deaths in Ngqeleni are those of Sonwabile Ntshaqa of Ngamnye Village and Thandisizwe Nkununtu from Mnyameni.
