MAMA Lizzy Mathiso’s garden keeps her strong and healthy. The 53-year-old from Lwandle in Strand, near Cape Town is celebrating a decade in her garden that not only feeds her but other community members as well. “My mum who is 99 years old taught me gardening and she still has a garden back home in the Eastern Cape,” said the mother of four. Lizzy said a garden must be treated like a child, because “plants listen”. She added: “I talk to them and they grow better because they can feel the love I have for them.” Most of the time she works alone, but sometimes the department of social development partners with correctional services to send convicts with lesser sentences to help in her garden. She said with the current state of the country’s economy, gardening helps save money. “Not only are vegetables healthy but it’s saving me money. I feed the children at my creche from this garden and give them some to take home because I don’t want them only to eat vegetables at school and not at home.” She also donates some of the vegetables to the old people around her who can no longer work for themselves. Nosakhele Mashau (39) said people can learn a lot from Lizzy: “She really loves her garden. “She grows some of the biggest spinach here.”
