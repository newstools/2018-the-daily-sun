DRIVING demands concentration but technology is only increasing the number of ways drivers can be distracted on the road ahead. Gumtree highlights five major cellphone motoring safety issues: - Texting is the absolute worst as it usually means both hands are off the wheel and the eyes are down as well. You should NEVER text while driving. If you really have to text, pull over to the side of the road or use a hands-free kit to send a voice note. - Calls, even with a hands-free kit, are a concern because concentration is often on the conversation and not on the road. Without a hands-free kit, calls are obviously a disaster waiting to happen. One hand on the wheel is not enough, especially when navigating busy intersections or challenging stretches of road. - Social sharing is not much better. You really can wait before checking out the video someone has sent you but it’s frightening how many people believe they can watch a video and drive safely at the same time. - Maps can be a problem as well. Because the technology is doing the navigation work, many drivers lose concentration on where they’re going and pay far less attention to what is happening around them. And some will blindly follow the voice directions even when a road is closed or has recently become a one-way. Music can cause problems as many people have vast libraries of music, podcasts, audiobooks and other media stored on their phones. Instead of just letting the media play, drivers spend too much time scrolling, searching or changing tracks instead of watching the road. Some drivers even ignore the safer steering wheel controls only available on a few cars to scroll their phones.
