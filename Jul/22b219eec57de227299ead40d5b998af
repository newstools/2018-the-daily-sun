THESE residents say they have been living in the area since February and are tired of illegal evictions. Residents of Phumula Mqashi in Tembisa, Gauteng met Ekurhuleni Metro police representatives to discuss the evictions and possible relocation areas. The people said they are victims of the rezoning started by the municipality earlier this year. “We’ve been forced out of our homes. There was no longer any room for us so we decided to come here. Now the cops are removing us from this piece of land we’ve found,” said a resident. Anna Mnisi (85) said the police came to evict them and burnt down her shack. She lost everything, including her Sassa documents. “I haven’t received my grant this month because they burnt my documents and my ID. I have nothing to eat and my grandchildren have to sleep outside in the cold without shelter or food.” Dumisani Mkhumbuza (26) said the Metro cops’ invasions have become part of life. “We’ve come to expect it. “The municipality failed to give us RDPs. If they can’t give us houses, they must provide serviced stands so we can try to build something for ourselves.” Metro police spokesman Wilfred Kgasago said when structures are removed, the municipality either allows people to keep their materials or takes them to storage facilities in trucks. Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said they have a court order. “Any occupation of that land violates the court order. The police were acting according to the law. “The area has already been declared a township,” Gadebe said. He said the municipality has started the project and is designing and upgrading the area. “The area is intended for a mega project to develop different types of settlements and build 100 000 houses,” Gadebe said.
