DEFENCE lawyers for three partially deaf youths are accusing a sign language interpreter of misleading their clients. Luthando Silwana, Lunga Khimbili and Zukile Danti are being accused of murdering Nodumo Mdleleni-Mzimane in 2015. Mdleleni-Mzimane was found lying in a pool of blood at her house at Efata School for the Blind and Deaf in Mthatha. On Thursday and Friday the Mthatha High Court listened to testimony by Sergeant Moyisile Ngqokoma, his former interpreter Sonwabo Mankuntywana and school housekeeper Nomsa Maseti. On the day of their arrest, Ngqokoma took their statements for the investigating officer, while Mankuntywana was the interpreter. The lawyers said the state’s key witness did not see the murder as he was at initiation school at the time. Before the sergeant took to the witness box, the lawyers argued whether the statements were admissions or confessions. They said their clients’ rights were not explained to them at the time of their arrest and one of the accused did not understand the interpreter as he was confusing. One of the lawyers said while Mankuntywana was interpreting for the accused, the investigating officer was trying to persuade them to admit to something they did not do. The housekeeper said she saw the key witness a day before the incident, but when questioned whether there was a register to prove this, said: “There are registers at the hostels but they may not be there as they are not properly maintained.” One of the lawyers said he had been trying to get hold of the registers, with no luck. The case was postponed to 6 August.
