AFTER several marches by nurses who were calling for Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo to intervene, he’s finally heard their cries. Nurses at KwaMashu Community Healthcare Centre, north of Durban, downed tools for three hours yesterday and waited for him. Grievances in the memorandum which Dhlomo received, included fearing for their safety and staff shortages. Apparently, they’ve been moered by patients at one point or the other. Daily Sun previously reported on their marches and how they wanted the MEC to improve security, especially for night-shift staff, following attacks. Nehawu secretary Phakama Ndunakazi said: “Many nurses have left, but their positions have not been filled. “Staff are also demanding the removal of the chief executive officer, who apparently only comes to work three days a week.” He said the department should bring in a new CEO. He said the MEC had seven days to respond to their grievances. “If nothing happens after this period, we’ll be forced to tell the workers to withdraw their services.” Dhlomo said he’d go through their grievances and respond soon. “I can’t immediately say how the issue of the attacks will be resolved as it involves residents,” said the MEC.
