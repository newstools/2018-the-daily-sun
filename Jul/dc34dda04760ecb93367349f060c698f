WHILE other hawkers sell vegetables and food, he was selling bullets and dagga! Shoppers were shocked when they found a 29-year-old man from Lesotho selling bullets in Welkom, Free State, on Thursday afternoon and immediately called the police. After arresting the man, cops said they had absolutely no idea where he got the bullets from. Thabo Mpine (47) from Orange Grove kasi in Thabong said he couldn’t believe it when the man approached him. “I was shopping with my 13-year-old grandson when the man came up to us and said he was selling bullets for as little as R20 each,” he said. “I told him I don’t have a gun but he still showed me the bullets. I started wondering if he wasn’t selling bombs as well. I didn’t feel safe, so I went home.” Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said the man was bust with 44 bullets and dagga. “We received a tip-off and public order police members swiftly started looking for the man in Manny’s Shopping Complex,” he said. “Our members searched him and found 16 PMP bullets, 25 6,35mm Browning bullets, one .243 Winchester bullet, one 5.56 bullet and one .38 special bullet. “Cash totalling R990 and dagga worth about R500 were also confiscated. The estimated value of the bullets is R4 500 and the suspect was immediately arrested. At this stage, it’s not yet known where the man got the bullets from. He was charged with possession of ammunition and dagga. He will appear in the Welkom Magistrates Court soon,” said Thakeng. Acting Welkom cluster commander Brigadier Mzondi Mojafi said he was proud of the members who made the arrest.
