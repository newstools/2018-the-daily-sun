C ONTRACTORS hired to dig trenches ekasi have been accused of damaging underground water pipes. As a result, it’s a common occurrence for streams of water to flood the streets for hours. This often happens in New Brighton, KwaZakhele and Zwide, where fibre optic cable trenches are being dug. This inconveniences residents because the municipality is forced to cut off the water supply while repairing damaged pipes. But they’ve defended themselves. One contractor (58) told Daily Sun: “We damage underground water pipes almost every hour because we’re given the wrong maps. “This pipe was broken five hours ago and we called Metro workers to come and fix it,” he said. “But they came after two hours and refused to repair it, and they insulted us in front of senior municipal managers. He said another water tap was leaking on Vuku Road. “We’ve reported this and they failed to fix it, and it’s been leaking for two weeks now,” he said. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “We always move swiftly to fix damaged pipes and charge a contractor that damaged the line. “We’ve already sent out a strong warning to contractors to work with caution because this is not only water lost, it’s an inconvenience to the public and businesses.”
