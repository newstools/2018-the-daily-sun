IN the popular soapie Skeem Saam, her character owed money to a mashonisa. Now in real life, two men are accusing actress Dipuo Kgaphola, who plays Sister Mokarati in the soapie, of owing them money. Grasscutters Japi Nkwana (29) and Thabiso Shumba (26) told the People’s Paper they were furious. The two said they were happy and proud when the famous woman from their kasi, Refilwe outside Cullinan, offered them work. “We used to brag that we knew a celebrity and where she lived,” Japi told Daily Sun. “She used to take us to the site near Midrand every day in her car and we were famous in Refilwe for working for an actress,” he said. “When she was on Skeem Saam, we made sure we didn’t miss the show.” But Japi claimed work stopped after two weeks. Thabiso said Dipuo promised to pay them at the end of June but hasn’t done so. “We went to her home to find out why we weren’t paid. She didn’t come out,” he claimed. “Her father told us she would pay us after three days and we left.” He claimed three days passed and they still didn’t get their money. “We phoned her and she dropped the call and switched off her phone. That’s when we knew she wasn’t prepared to pay us.” He said she owed them R1 200 each. “We have kids and families. People don’t believe us when we say she didn’t pay us. They say she’s an actress and has money.” Daily Sun called Dipuo, who denied dodging the two. “I told them I haven’t been paid and even showed them my communication with the contractor,” said the actress “As soon as I get paid, I will pay them.” She said she was surprised the two chose to go public about their non-payment. “I’m an honest person. They know where I stay and I’m not hiding,” said Dipuo.
