MINISTERS in the Inter-ministerial Committee on Social
Security Services have accused Cash Paymaster Services of trying to disrupt
efforts to transfer grant recipients. Addressing the media, Communication Minister Nomvula
Mokonyane said there’s certainty and confidence in the implementation of the
new card system. “We are proud to announce that we have reached a milestone
of more than a million people who have been successfully migrated from the old
system, to the new South African Post Office (SAPO) card,” Mokonyane said. Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu said the
department has taken CPS to court over the continued illegal deductions on recipient’s
grants. She said being in court is due to the 2.5 million beneficiaries
that CPS continued to pay at various pay points across the country. “So what we have done so far, we’ve got 1.6 million
beneficiaries which are back with us,” Shabangu said. Shabangu added that CPS had its employees stationed at pay
points to try and influence beneficiaries to continue using CPS. Mokonyane also mentioned that the partnership between SASSA
and SAPO in the distribution of grants has reached a level of stability. She said SAPO has managed to migrate 1.83 million
beneficiaries to the new gold SASSA card and that they are planning to migrate
all social grants beneficiaries that are still getting paid by CPS to migrate
to SAPO by the end of August.
