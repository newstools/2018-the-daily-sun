BUSINESSES with dirty premises and old food have no place in Nelson Mandela Bay. That was what officials told residents of Port Elizabeth when they went from shop to shop in Korsten to inspect food outlets. The old market centre in the city is popular among kasi residents as the shops sell food at affordable prices but it has become dirty and overcrowded over the years. Councillor Lance Grootboom, who led the inspection, said: “The operation is planned to cover the whole metro. The goal is to ensure operators preparing and serving food stick to environmental and health laws. “We have seen that a number of shops have no certificates of compliance.” Environmental health director Patrick Nodwele said they visited Korsten first, because it is a food hot spot. “We are checking on used and expired cooking oil, how food is prepared and whether businesses have waste management certificates for rubbish to be collected from the premises,” he said. “We closed shops without licences and issued fines between R1 000 and R5 000.” A shop owner who found his shop closed while he was away, said the municipality should have warned them that officials were visiting. “Where will I put all this meat now that they have closed my shop? They should have given me time to sell my food.”
