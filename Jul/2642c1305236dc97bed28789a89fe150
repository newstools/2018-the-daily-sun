COPS have stood up protest and condemn acts of criminality against women and children. Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille, police deputy minister Bongani Mkongi and Councillor JP Smith led about 100 unarmed cops and prison officials who marched slowly to parliament in Cape Town yesterday. Cape Town Bishop Derrick Ntsolo was among the clergymen. Mayor De Lille said: “We are all here today to start action against people who are abusing our women and children. I’m challenging all men who are here today to recruit 10 more men and share with them what you have learnt today.” She said although South Africa has one of the best constitutions in the world, the rights of children and women are still disregarded. Western Cape Justice Department head Hishaam Mohamed said: “We are here to say the scourge of violence against women needs to end. “We are inspired by our President Cyril Ramaphosa and his Thuma Mina campaign.” He said the Western Cape had the highest number of domestic violence cases against children and women. Deputy minister Mkongi took a swipe at Arthur Mafokate for allegedly bashing his former fiance Busisiwe Twala. “We must take a step today and say down with Arthur Mofokate. He is not a man. Uyinja uyi nonsense!” said Mkongi. He also told cops not to ask young girls who report abuse against their boyfriends stupid questions.
