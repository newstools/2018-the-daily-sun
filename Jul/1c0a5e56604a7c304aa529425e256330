LAST week an officer of the Gauteng Metro Police found himself on the receiving end of an attack by a man on the street. But the attacker got a lot more than he had bargained for! A video recorded during the attack shows a man charging towards two cops, screaming “Shaya! Shaya!” One of the cops seems to be fully in control. He calmly strikes the man’s face, then ducks a wild blow that goes over his head. The cop then takes the man to the ground and the fight is over. Yesterday Gauteng Department of Community Safety spokesman Ofentse Morwane said they were concerned about what had happened. He said the two Gauteng traffic police officers stopped a motorist, who was alleged to be drunk, on the N12 West. The driver tried to get away by running towards Eldorado Park. “During the process of arresting the motorist a member of the community charged towards one of the officers and assaulted him,” Morwane said. “He was also arrested and charged with interference as well as with assaulting a law enforcement officer.” Morwane said the importance of a good relationship between the police and communities in combating crime could not be over-emphasised. “It is with extreme disappointment we notice members of the community behaving in such a manner,” he said. “The barbaric action displayed by this man leaves much to be desired and it should be condemned in the strongest possible terms,” said Morwane.
