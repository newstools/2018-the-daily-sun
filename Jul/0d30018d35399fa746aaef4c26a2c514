DUDUZANE Zuma is out of the country but the National Prosecuting Authority says he did not violate his bail conditions. Reports say he allegedly flew to Dubai on Friday to be with his pregnant wife. NPA spokeswoman Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane confirmed to Daily Sun that Duduzane is out of the country. Duduzane was granted bail of R100 000 after making his first appearance on charges relating to state capture. His bail conditions stipulated that he was to surrender his two passports to the investigating officer. He was not expected to apply for travel documents until the case was finalised and to inform the investigating officer if he wanted to leave Gauteng. “We can confirm that the NPA is aware that Duduzane travelled out of the country. His bail conditions stipulated that he should inform his investigating officer if he wanted to travel and he has followed due processes,” said Louw-Mjonondwane. She didn’t confirm whether Duduzane was in Dubai. Duduzane is the first high-ranking individual to be directly charged in a corruption case linked to state capture. He is also facing charges of culpable homicide. His corruption case was postponed to 24 January while his culpable homicide case was postponed to 23 August.
