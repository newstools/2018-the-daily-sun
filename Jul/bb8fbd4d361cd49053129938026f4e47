AFTER a taximan crashed his taxi full of school kids into a van and then a house, residents were shocked but relieved that no serious injuries occurred. But house owner Xolani Zakwe (51), of Azalea in Pietermaritzburg, in the KZN Midlands, is spitting fire. Xolani suffered damages when the taxi ferrying 14 kids lost control and crashed into his house on Tuesday. “I was not at home when the accident happened but I was called by my neighbours to tell me about it. I want the driver to fix my van and house because if he didn’t have a problematic taxi, my assets wouldn’t be damaged.” He said the taxi driver called him on the day of the accident and promised he would come and see him so they could discuss the situation. “I’m still waiting and I’m going to make sure he fixes my things because I paid lots of money to get them,” said Xolani. He said if his van hadn’t been parked in the yard, the taxi would’ve completely destroyed his house. He told Daily Sun yesterday that he was on his way to open a case with police. After the crash, two school kids were rushed to hospital for minor injuries but were later discharged. The other 12 kids were taken to Fezokuhle and Nzuzwenhle primary schools. When the SunTeam called the taxi driver, Bongani Madlala, he confirmed the accident. “The taxi’s brakes failed during the trip. When I took it home it never showed any sign that there were problems,” said Bongani. He said he was aware he needed to fix Xolani’s damaged house and van.
