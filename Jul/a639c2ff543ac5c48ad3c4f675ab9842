A TAXI owner was shot and a taxi burnt at Hebron in North West on Wednesday. This was after a violent taxi fight broke out between the Hebron and Letlhabile Taxi Associations over taxi routes. The associations have been at war since Monday. According to Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone, North West police spokesman, a taxi belonging to a member of the Hebron association was set alight, while 10 members of the Letlhabile association were stoned. “One Hebron association operator was allegedly shot at Oskraal Village. “He was taken to hospital for medical treatment,” he said. Hebron taxi operators said the Letlhabile operators are not supposed to use their route. They said they tried to come to an understanding but no agreement was reached. An operator from Letlhabile said the Hebron group was harassing them and demanding to use their route. Nearby residents said they no longer felt safe. A resident Victor Mekwa said: “We fear we will be caught up in their fight and wish they could resolve their differences.”
