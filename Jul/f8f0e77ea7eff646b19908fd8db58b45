THE “happiest day of our lives” was rapidly becoming a
nightmare as the storm hit the beach. Dulce Gonzalez (24) and Ariel Gonzalez Mass (30) had
carefully planned their dream wedding for 30 June on a beautiful beach in Pascagoula,
a town on the Mississippi coastline in America. According to the Washington
Post, the unhappy couple huddled in cars with their wedding guests as they
watched the storm clouds roll in and the thunder, lightning and wind rev up. The white folding chairs, white carpet with petals and
flower-strewn altar that had been prepared for their ceremony were drenched and
a mess. Dulce told the Washington
Post: “I was trying to hold back my tears. I’m about to have a panic
attack, I’m asking my mom, ‘What am I gonna do?’ ” Then the stranger came along. Cynthia Strunk (67) tapped on Dulce’s car window and
offered to hold her wedding at her house. She and her husband Shannon (53) had watched the disaster
unfolding on the beach near her house and decided they’d offer the wedding
party a haven. Cynthia said: “The bride’s mother started crying at that
point and Dulce said, ‘Thank you’ and she had tears in her eyes.” Cynthia and Shannon hurried to ready their house, and in
10 minutes their spare chairs were set out and their large house was ready to
host their 50 unexpected guests. Dulce said: “They had everything set as if we actually planned
it. It was perfect. I told my husband that the Strunks were little angels that
God sent us.” After a beautiful ceremony, Dulce’s dad thanked the
Strunks. “The father was just so appreciative and they were just such
gracious, wonderful people. We were just happy to do it — and to us it was no
big deal,” said Cynthia. “I did tell them that when they have their first baby
that I fully expect them to bring the baby to the house and tell them where it
all began,” she added. Dulce said she’s planning on it.
