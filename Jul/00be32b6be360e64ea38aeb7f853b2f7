IT DOES not get any more muddled than this. Advocate William Mokhari SC’s ruling that Ajax Cape Town be docked points, thus resulting in their relegation from the PSL to the National First Division, was brushed aside by Judge Denise Fisher yesterday. As things stand now, Ajax are back in the Absa Premiership, sitting pretty in 15th place, while Platinum Stars are 16th and relegated, as was initially the case. The judge handed down the judgment yesterday after having thoroughly studied the arbitrator’s ruling since last week following arguments in the High Court. Fisher said Mokhari had no jurisdiction or eligibility to determine whether Tendai Ndoro, who is at the centre of the whole mess, was eligible or not to be fielded in the affected matches. Ndoro parted ways with Ajax last week. The matter has now been referred back to Fifa. Noting Fisher’s judgment, the PSL said it would seek legal advice “and the appropriate steps will be taken in due course”. How this affects the PSL: As it stands, the league will have to come up with a new date for the play-offs involving Leopards, Cosmos and Ajax in place of Stars. Ajax chief executive Ari Efstathiou said in a statement that the Urban Warriors were “naturally very pleased with Judge Fisher’s ruling” to set aside Mokhari’s decision. He said: “The club will comment further once full clarity on Judge Fisher’s judgment is received from the legal team.” For the league to appease all parties, it would have to cater for NFD champions Highlands Park and Leopards in the elite league, while Ajax must also be considered, as well as Cosmos, to save face in this embarrassing and ugly affair. This could mean the top flight would have to become an 18-team league, pending negotiations with the sponsors to cater for two more teams. Lunga Sokhela of AmaZulu said they were relieved and accepted the judgment. Some club bosses affected by this ruling have declined to comment, while others are still studying the judgment.
