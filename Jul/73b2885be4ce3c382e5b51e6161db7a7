VENDA King Toni Ramabulana urged others to follow his example after donating R30 000 to a fund to save Lwamondo Secondary School. The king was speaking at the school’s 50th anniversary celebration in Lwamondo, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo last week. The event was attended by the Vhembe House of Traditional leaders chairman Thovhele Kutama, Chief Calvin Nelwamondo, former principals and teachers. During the event, a history of the school was read out and a site visit was conducted for visitors to see the state of the school. The king urged everyone to donate money to the school. Before he left the stage, R60 000 had been collected. “There are many challenges at the school but we will leave it to the school to decide how the money will be best used,” he said. Chief Nelwamondo thanked the king and the Kagiso Trust for making an effort to improve the resources at the school. Reverend Zwo Nevhutalu, a Kagiso Trust trustee, said the organisation was excited about helping the school. Former pupil, businessman and well-known farmer Tshianeo Mathidi, who helped organise the event, said they were not proud of the conditions at the school. “Some of the classrooms are now in a state of collapse. Our brothers and sisters are forced to risk their lives in these classrooms. “There is no hall. Functions are held out in the open. There is no library and classes are overcrowded because there are not enough classrooms,” he said.
