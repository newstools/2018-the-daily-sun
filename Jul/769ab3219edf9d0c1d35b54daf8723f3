THE fight to get their land back is far from over for farm dwellers and those who were evicted from farms. Msukaligwa Emaplazini Forum members marched on Friday to hand over a memorandum to the department of land affairs in Ermelo, Mpumalanga. They said they are gatvol of the bad conditions they are living under and want the department to intervene. Forum chairman Ignatius Mahlangu said they organised the march to address the abuse farm dwellers face. “We previously raised these issues but nothing was done. “This is why we want the department to address them, as it allocates the land.” Amos Ndlovu (58) told Daily Sun a farmer planted maize on top of the grave of his daughter, who is buried on Mogostad Farm. Amos said he can’t visit her grave as most graves were destroyed. “My mkhulu worked on the farm and my father took over when he died. “At the time, the owner gave my father a piece of land but when he also died, the new owners did as they pleased.” Vusi Mlangeni (34), another angry resident, said his mkhulu and his father worked at Jaglust and Vaalbuilt Farms but when his father died in 2003, the farmer didn’t compensate the family. “Instead, he forced my mkhulu to pay for his cattle to graze on the farm and his pension money went to this farmer, who demanded R80 a cow. “He also deducted money from his workers, saying it was for accommodation.” Maxwell Thwala (42) grew up on Jaglust Farm as his father worked there most of his life. He said: “Our families are buried there but we can’t visit their graves as the new owners say we will be charged with trespassing.” “We want our land back as our grandparents worked there all their lives and we deserve to own those portions of land. “Most of us are still interested in farming as this is what we know and grew to love.” The department’s Zandile Shongwe received the memorandum and said a response was expected within 21 days.
