A ward councillor felt residents’ anger when they nearly burned his office down. But the fire was put out before it caused any damage. This was after residents of Bronville in Welkom, Free State didn’t have electricity for a week. The gatvol residents also blocked the R73 road to Virginia with burning tyres on Monday. Shops belonging to foreigners were also looted. Thabiso Mosieleng (36) said they couldn’t cope without electricity. “We haven’t had electricity for about a week. The municipality couldn’t assist us to get power, which made us angry. “Our food is being wasted in our fridges and we’re getting cold as we can’t use our electric blankets and heaters,” said Thabiso. Kgojane Matutle, Matjhabeng municipal spokesman, said there was a power cut on Wednesday. “There is a sewage spillage due to a blockage and the power supply cable underground got in contact with the sewage. “We also have a problem with illegal miners who attempted to steal the cable and as a result, we experienced a power cut.” He said they removed stones blocking the sewage but the illegal miners put them back. “We have engaged with the police to assist us with the illegal miners,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Malebo Khosana confirmed the unrest and said arrests were made. “Thirteen people aged between 20 and 30 were arrested and charged with public violence. “No one was injured but shops were damaged and looted.”
