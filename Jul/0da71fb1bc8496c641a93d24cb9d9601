ACTING Education MEC Bongi Sithole-Moloi yesterday advised matrics to stay up all night, within reason, if they wanted to pass. She was speaking at the launch of the final exams 100-day countdown at Umlazi Comprehensive Technical High School, south of Durban, yesterday. Exams start on 15 October and Sithole-Moloi told pupils this meant they had to start working hard. “Keep the lights on until the final day of your exams. Today I’m saying to you that you must forget about TV, the soccer world cup in Russia and the Durban July,” said the MEC. She thanked teachers for sacrificing their weekends and holidays. “I thank you for braving the cold weather and teaching extra classes,” she said. “What you’re doing is good and it makes us proud as parents and the department.” Sithole-Moloi said the department expected the matric pass rate to be over 80% this year. Matric pupil Aphiwe Mfeka (17) said: “It’s been a tough six months, but we’ll succeed.”
