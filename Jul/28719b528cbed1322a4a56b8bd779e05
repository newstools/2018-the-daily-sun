SLOVO and Mandela Park sections in QwaQwa, Free State have been classified as high crime areas. For this reason the Community Policing Forum, cops and the department of correctional services held an imbizo at the community hall on Friday. According to Moses Moloi, CPF chairman in ward 33, thugs mostly target women and children. Moloi told Daily Sun that house robberies, rape and domestic violence were the most common crimes in the area. “Some residents are robbed during the day by thugs. “Victims sometimes end up not reporting the crimes,” he said. Councillor Sonto Mlangeni said she hoped the imbizo would help reduce the high rate of crime in the ward. Mlangeni said things were already so bad that residents were afraid to walk freely during the day. Mapaseka Madonsela, a victim co-ordinator at Qholaqhwe Advice Centre, said some thugs don’t know the consequences of committing a crime. She advised women to respect their husbands. “Children must be taught that their fathers are valuable, even when they are unemployed.” She urged families to stay together and solve their problems in way that will not hurt anyone. Paulos Moletsane (26), one of the youths at the imbizo, said he had turned into a monster because of his friends. “I felt like an idiot if I didn’t smoke drugs like them,” said Paulos. He thanked the organisers of the event, saying more lives of young people would be saved.
