THE man who allegedly killed his former girlfriend and burned her body in an open field has chosen to apply for a Legal Aid lawyer. Siviwe Khusani (26) is accused of murdering Azintle Feni (25) of Motherwell kasi, Port Elizabeth, last month. Police spent almost 12 hours interrogating Siviwe, who later took them to a remote area where he allegedly burnt her body. When he appeared in the Motherwell Magistrates Court on Friday, he looked confident and smiled at the public seated in the gallery. The matter was postponed to Friday. Feni was reported missing on 25 June after attending a June 16 party. Police received information on 28 June that she was last seen in the company of Khusani. The cops went to the suspect’s place and found a blue car in the yard. There were traces of blood in the vehicle. More bloodstains were found on the bed at another house in Kamvelihle kasi, where Siviwe frequently stays. After being questioned by police, he took them to the bush near Chalumna Street, where Feni’s body was found dumped and burnt.
