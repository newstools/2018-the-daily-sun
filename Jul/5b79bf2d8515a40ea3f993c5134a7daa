IT has been almost a month since Melita Maake and her beautiful twin babies went missing. Now police are searching for the 38-year-old mum and her eight-month-old twins Nicolle and Nicholas. Their family, from Lulekani kasi outside Phalaborwa in Limpopo, opened a missing persons case on Monday. Melita and her sons left home at about 10am on Sunday, 1 July. Constable Maphure Manamela told the People’s Paper: “We searched for them at friends and relatives’ homes but weren’t successful.” Manamela said Melita’s cellphone was still on voicemail. She said cops were pleading with residents to help them in their search for the missing mum and her kids. Manamela said investigations had indicated that Melita and her two sons might perhaps be in Gauteng. “At the moment, we can’t confirm whether they’re indeed in Gauteng,”  she said. “But we will soon have more info as investigations are ongoing.” On the day she went missing, Melita was wearing a black pair of trousers and a doek. Police have asked anyone who has information on their whereabouts to contact Constable Ntsako Mabunda on 015 783 5000 or 072 708 9794.
