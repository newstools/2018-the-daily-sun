THE cop from Tsakane Police Station used to terrorise tavern owners, either taking liquor or demanding big bribes. But finally, the bad cop and his colleague were bust. On Thursday, the provincial police’s anti corruption team pounced on them in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni as they were taking R2 500 from a tavern owner. They were arrested on the spot and charged with corruption and extortion. Tavern owners across Tsakane, Duduza and KwaThema were happy to hear the cruel cop’s reign of terror had ended. Some said they lost as much as R15 000 to R50 000 in booze to this cop. Vusi Manana said: “He used to come to our tavern, saying we were operating without permits and demand R2 500. But when we enquired at the Liquor Board, our permits were up to date and we were allowed to operate.” “We even reported him to Ipid but he refused to give back our booze.” Ten tavern owners told Daily Sun he said their permits weren’t recognised, even though they were perfectly legal. “The Liquor Board told us we can operate but he thought he could do what he wanted. “We’re happy he had to eat humble pie.” Colonel Noxolo Kweza confirmed two cops were bust and would soon appear in court for corruption and extortion.
