THE cops are confident they will soon have Wellington “Bibi” Cenenda behind bars. Cenenda (38), the number one heist enemy believed to be behind 23 of the 178 heists this year alone, is in hiding but may soon be arrested, according to The Sunday Times. The newspaper reported yesterday that six of Cenenda’s lieutenants have been arrested in the past 10 days. “We catch Cenenda, we end it all,” Gauteng Hawks boss Major- General Prince Mokotedi is reported to have said. The police said they have virtually castrated Cenenda’s Pretoria gang and they were now crippling his Joburg gang. The cops’ confidence comes from catching major suspects such as former Zimbabwe military marksman Paul Sibande, who is known as The Patriarch, and Botswana’s Thato Gaopatwe, known as The Bomber. Other suspects caught are Sello Senyatsi, Tauyaborwa Machika, Collen Mmadi, Calvin Molete and Stanford Dihangoane. Among those arrested was a 67-year-old gogo and a Tshwane Metro police officer, the second policewoman to be arrested. Cenenda’s gang has allegedly taken R46 million in their operations and 17 people have been killed and 93 injured. Some people on Facebook congratulated the police, while others said they will believe it when they see the men in handcuffs. Michelle Rancia Peme: “Finally caught, that took long enough! R46 million stolen and he stayed in Tembisa. Let’s hope his parents got a property out of this.” SA Marumo: “Well done. Now people must realise that crime does not pay regardless of how many times it is committed!” Mgcini KaMazana: “There are too many lies in all these arrests. I don’t buy it.” Tawanyane Tlhako: “This is just an inflated report that is meant to restore police credibility and inspire public confidence. “It’s absolutely nothing to write home about.”
