I promise to use the knowledge gained from this pageant to help grow charities across the Free State,” she said. “I love exploring and gaining an understanding of other cultures and religions.” She added that she decided to enter the pageant to reduce the negative opinions about women who enter beauty contests. “I always encourage young women with big bodies to show off their talents and love their bodies.” Sivuyile also sings and dances on stage.
