OFTEN youngsters do well when they follow in the footsteps of their parents. Sammy Thange and his daughter Naledi are a good example of that. Former professional soccer player Sammy Thage (54), who played for Orlando Pirates from 1987 until 1989, has carried his soccer skills over to his kids. Speaking to Daily Sun, Sammy said he has four children, Katleho (30), Tumelo (21), Naledi (15) and Atlegile (13) and at the moment it’s Naledi who’s the shining star. Naledi, the only girl in the family, is set to compete in Denmark in the Dana Cup tournament. The team will jet out of the country on Saturday and come back on 29 July. “Naledi started playing with my boys and I in the yard. “She would always join us and I ended up training her and my sons together,” said the proud father. Naledi plays at the Janine van Wyk Academy in Bedfordview. Sammy said he never expected Naledi to play soccer at this level. “I’m very proud and humbled by her journey,” he said. “I wish parents would support their kids in their sport. “If parents are close to their kids it leaves its mark and makes them prosper.” Naledi was away training but her dad said she it was a dream come true for her to go on an overseas football trip. “She always competed with older kids,” he said. “She is happy with her progress but she knows she has a lot of work to do to reach the level she wants to achieve. “She is looking forward to the trip and the games,” said Thage.
