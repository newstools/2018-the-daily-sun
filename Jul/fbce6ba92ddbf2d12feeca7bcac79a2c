A CUNNING criminal in America picked her victims by going
through the obituaries in newspapers, timing her robberies for when her targets
would be at funerals. According to Charlotte
Observer, Latonia Shelecia Stewart (26) from the Bronx in New York City was
a regular reader of a newspaper that carried obituaries of people who had died
in Westchester County, a suburban area just outside the city. Stewart would then look up the names of the dead person’s
family, and break into their homes while they were attending the funeral. Cop got wise to her scam when they noticed a string of
burglaries occurring in the area over the last few months. Cop John J. Slusarz told Greenwich Time: “Criminals read the newspaper, too, to get whatever
intelligence they can gather. Someone passes away, the funeral time is listed. It
can be assumed the house is vacant.” Once cops had registered that there was a pattern in
burglaries happening in the area, their investigations turned up a clue:
Stewart’s car, a silver Acura MDX, was often seen in the vicinity of the crime. In May, the cops set a trap. Plain clothed officers waited
outside a home of a recently deceased resident. Eventually they spotted the
silver Acura and pulled it over. In it they found Stewart, who had in her car
property that had earlier been reported stolen, according to Bronx News. She was charged with possession of stolen property and
conspiracy to commit burglary, according to NBC
New York, and released on bail.
