Local presenter and actress Thmbisa Mdoda recently got involved in a heated exchange with a racist on Twitter. The exchange started when the former Our Perfect Wedding host replied to a racial tweet she saw by a user who seemed to be complaining about poor service at the King Shaka International Airport. The tweet read: “King Shaka International Airport...bags have been dribbling out a few at a time for 25 minutes. One of the things I hate most about ending Apartheid...is that our Civilisation has to be reduced to theirs.” Mdoda who was less than amused by the tweet replied “Then go get your own damn bag !” The exchange quickly escalated as the user refused to back down claiming South African Airports used to work much better “before the garden boys and kitchen maids were allowed to take over.” Thembisa was not the only person rubbed up the wrong way by the user’s tweets and soon enough, many other users got behind her.

You don’t understand how airports work (not surprised) Evidently, neither do you?? !!! I know how they used to work — before the garden boys & kitchen maids were allowed to take over ...and still, here are you, acting just below that particular pedigree. Well done boy. Well done !!! ausi Thembisa; pic.twitter.com/8VqP4lZRQx Racist the “not surprised” - you give the rest of us a dreadful name and then anger ensues and we all - including you will simply suffer more - you are really an absolute pillock ... not in my name thank you.
