THE fight against HIV/Aids will never be won as long as the issue of TB is ignored. This was what Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said at the National Aids Council meeting held at The Ranch Hotel outside Polokwane, Limpopo, on Friday. He said TB had very serious economic consequences and killed more people than all other diseases combined. He said the disease kills slowly, which is why people are not scared of it. “According to the World Health Organisation, if your country has more than 250 people per 100 000 with TB you are facing a national crisis. “In South Africa the number is about 750 in 100 000. This means we have a national crisis times three.” Deputy president David Mabuza said he was encouraged by the passing of the National Health Insurance Bill. He said the bill would ensure everyone’s health rights were met. “We know these diseases are not only a medical challenge but also a factor in the quality of life of our people. “These illnesses cannot be divorced from our struggle against poverty, inequality and unemployment.” Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha said the government hopes a cure will be found for HIV.
