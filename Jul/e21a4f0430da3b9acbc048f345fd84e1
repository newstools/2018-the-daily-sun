NCENGEKILE Mhlongo celebrates the young Zulu girl’s journey into womanhood in her beadwork. Ncengekile (30), from KwaMajozi, Pomeroy in KZN, wants to provide those who still practise umemulo with the full gear for the ritual ceremony. She said she dresses the girls in full traditional Zulu attire – from the skirt to the belt, necklace and mbhido (a headband). “This is my tradition. I grew up dressing in beads as a little girl and I also followed the same route of umemulo.” Ncengekile said she also makes beads for women for their wedding day. “These are my two specialties and I get most orders in summer,” said Ncengekile. She said she started doing beadwork as a trade in 2013 when she was visiting Gauteng for the first time. “I was fascinated by the pride of a group of women at Mai Mai hostel in Jeppestown where I live now and also sell my work.” She said used to do beading back at home but it was different from how it’s done in Gauteng. “It is so modern and beautiful. I like it.” She said her week is always well planned. On Monday and Tuesday she makes only skirts and Wednesday until Friday she does beading. “Most of the time I’m at home because I work only with orders. My clients are from Tshwane, Joburg and KZN.” Ncengekile said she didn’t only make beads for the money. “The most important thing is to make ceremonies beautiful and successful with full traditional Zulu attire.” She urged other women not to just stay at home and do nothing. “They have to try doing something such as handwork,” said Ncengekile.
