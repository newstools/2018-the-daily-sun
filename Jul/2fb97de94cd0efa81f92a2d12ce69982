AUDITIONS for season 14 of Idols SA have ended. What went down in Joburg, the last city to hold the auditions, will surely be written in the Mzansi music industry’s history books. Gospel musician Rebecca Malope joined Randall Abrahams, Unathi Msengana and Somizi Mhlongo at the judges’ table. Not only did Randall laugh, but he also joined in on the fun at the table. And who can forget the first-ever slay queen prayer? On the contrary, Dr Ribs – as the gospel musician is fondly called – took her job on the judging panel very seriously. “I’m so excited to be a part of this show,” she said. “I once entered a singing competition, so I know exactly what these contestants are going through.” She was referring to the 1987 Shell Road to Fame music talent search, which she won in the BestVocalist category. “I’m looking for someone with talent,” she said. “I need a voice that will wake me up in the middle of the night and say ‘that’s the one!’” Jaws hit the floor when a contestant who had previously worked with her walked into the audition room. “I know you. You’re my child. You won’t disappoint me,” she said. The contestant blew everyone away with her exceptional voice and received four nods from the judges. The last Telkom pop up audition took place in Polokwane and left a few residents jumping for joy as they clutched their golden tickets. In the end, 87 tickets were given away during the nationwide audition. Now the singers are through to theatre week, where pretenders will be separated from the true talent.
