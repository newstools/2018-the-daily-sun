702’s Xolani Gwala has made his first public appearance in months after recovering from cancer. The radio presenter attended the station’s Walk the Talk event at the marks park grounds in Emmerantia on Sunday. The huge event was attended by scores of people and many of them were happy to see Gwala in good spirits. Gwala announced on air in a conversation with Steven Grootes a while ago that he was diagnosed with colon cancer. Since then, he has been in a battle to get back to full health and Thabisile Mbete, 702 Station Manager revealed earlier this month that Gwala was on remission and would be back to work as soon as he fully recovers.
