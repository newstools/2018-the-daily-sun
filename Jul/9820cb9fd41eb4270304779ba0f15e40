THE relatives of a 27-year-old man who ended his life on Monday have many unanswered questions. Buhle Themba from KwaNhlamvu in Mseleni, northern KZN hanged himself hours after he dropped hints about committing suicide. A source said Buhle knocked on his sisters’ window and told them it was the last time they would hear his voice. “Then he walked back to his room, which is situated a few metres away from the main house. “His sisters struggled to connect the dots, so they ran to his room to find out what he meant. “But instead of opening the door for them, Buhle told his sisters he was tired of living a life of poverty,” said the source. When his relatives went to his room the following morning, they found his body hanging from the roof. “His relatives are confused. “They are still wondering why the fact that he wasn’t prospering bothered him so much. “They never complained about his joblessness or the small amount of money he earned at a car wash near Mseleni Hospital,” said the source. The source said the family was surprised by the suicide because Buhle did not have any children to take care of. “He left a brief note where he said he loved his siblings and he asked them to forgive him for taking his life.” Daily Sun called Ntombi Themba, Buhle’s sister, for comment. She said: “Let me give the phone to my older brother. “He will speak to you.” The older brother said: “It would have been better if you came here so that we could tell you about the incident face to face.” KZN police spokeswoman, Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident. “Police opened an inquest docket and are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.”
