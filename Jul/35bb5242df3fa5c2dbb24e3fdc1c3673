THE University of Cape Town’s new vice-chancellor, Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng, was at the Langa Methodist Church on Sunday. She urged community members to keep her in their prayers as her journey would not be easy. Phakeng, who was elected to the position in March, received the church’s blessing. “If I fail it will not only be about me but all black women because we are in this together,” said Phakeng. She told the congregation that she was new and had come to the church to introduce herself, telling the community that the university was for them. “The university is for everyone and in order to go forward, the community must write to us. I will be waiting for you to write, not only when you are complaining but also to come up with suggestions and to applaud the work we will be doing together,” said Phakeng. She said the university belonged to the community and that they had a right to challenge it because they wanted it to be better. “You must also protect it because your kids are there and your great grandkids will also go there.” Reverend Nkosinathi Geja said the university needed a human face and they were asking God to empower her. “It is good to begin your journey in church so that we can immerse you in the spirit of God. You need all this strength,” said Geja. Bishop Michel Hansrod prayed for the professor, saying: “Nothing will go wrong if you put God first, even though things will not be easy, but with Him you will get all the strength you are going to need.”
