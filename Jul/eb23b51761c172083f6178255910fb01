Celebrity chef, Siba Mtongana and her hunky husband, Brian, have welcomed their fourth child into the world. The couple, who already have two boys and a girl, now have two of each with the arrival of their baby girl. Although she gave birth three days ago, Siba only shared the wonderful news on Sunday morning through her social media accounts. The pair decided to name their new bundle of joy NtandoyeNkosi aka Ntando Mtongana. “We're so excited to finally welcome her,” Siba shared on Instagram, “Her siblings are so excited and fighting over her already. “Fourth time around, I still maintain that child bearing and birthing is one of the greatest miracles of all times,” she added. She went on to express her gratitude towards everyone who had been there for her and her family throughout the nine months. “Thank you Lord for this precious and beautiful addition to our family and thank you all for your kind words throughout the pregnancy,” she concluded.
