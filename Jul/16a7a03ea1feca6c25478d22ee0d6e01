IT HAS been a month since Vuyisile Simamane’s son went missing, and now the 21-year-old mum from Umthwalume in southern KZN has been admitted to hospital! Three-month-old baby Luyanda went missing on 2 June while his mum was sleeping next to him. Vuyisile told Daily Sun that she was admitted to hospital on Monday. “My mum took me to hospital when she realised I was not myself after my baby went missing. She took me to Thuthwini Clinic in the hope I would get counselling, but the nurses said my blood pressure was too high due to stress.” She said she was then transferred to GJ Crookes Hospital. She told the People’s Paper that she suspected her son was snatched by a family member, Lungelo Simamane, who visited her for two weeks before disappearing on the same day as her son. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, KZN police spokesman, said Lungelo was believed to be in Isipingo. “The police are asking anyone with information on his whereabouts to contact Captain Sunil Singh on 082 566 7163 or 039 688 7900. “CrimeStop can also be contacted on 08600 10111,” said Zwane.
