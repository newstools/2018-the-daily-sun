THE devil’s children have taken over their kasi and people who dare to go out after dark risk their lives! Two victims have come forward to tell of their horror when they were attacked and robbed on separate occasions. Residents from Bothaville kasi in the Free State said the three attackers who cover their faces with balaclavas, call themselves ninjas. Thomas Radebe (46) was allegedly attacked by the ninjas on Sunday after returning from a night out. “I woke up in hospital with 146 stitches in my head. Doctors said I was lucky to be alive,” Thomas told Daily Sun. “I was walking home from a tavern after watching Russia defeat Spain when out of nowhere, three men with balaclavas jumped in front of me and kicked me down. “They dragged me to a nearby ditch and started beating me. Rocks were thrown on my head before they started hacking me with pangas. “They demanded I give them money, but when they found I had none, they took my cellphone, belt and jacket and left me to die. “Before I passed out, I heard one of the men saying they needed to cut my head off,” he said. “I was lucky because while they were assaulting me, they saw a vehicle’s lights approaching and left. “I was discovered when a couple who came from the same tavern saw a trail of blood leading to the ditch. “I’m in pain. I want those men to be arrested so they can pay for what they have done,” Thomas said. Vusi Ncubi was another victim and is still in hospital. He said: “Three men came and ordered me to kneel before they hacked me on my head on Sunday. They all carried sharp objects and told me they were the devil’s kids in town. “I was robbed of R2 500, which would have paid my rent. “I haven’t been to the cop shop to report the matter yet,” Vusi said. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said cops were investigating cases of assault but said no one had been arrested yet.
