Eskom has tabled two offers to unions, both of which
offer a 7% wage increase. Unions were presented with a new offer by Eskom in the
latest round of negotiations between Eskom and unions. Negotiations are set to resume on 27 July after the
National Union of Metalworkers in South Africa (NUMSA) were presented with two
offers by Eskom. The first option included a three-year wage agreement
which entailed a 7% wage increase for years one, two and three. It also included an increment for the housing allowance. The second option also offered a three-year wage
agreement. The option offers a 7.5% increase for year one, and a 7%
increase for years two and three. However, this option does not include a housing
allowance. NUMSA general secretary Irvin Jim said that the union
will take this offer and present it to its members. He also said that Eskom CEO PHakamani Hadebe promised
that workers would receive their bonus payouts this year. “Eskom’s challenges should not be used as a justification
to deny workers their well-deserved bonus,” he said. “Bonuses will be discussed at the Central Consultative
Forum (CCF) to be held on Friday the 20th. After that we will know whether
bonuses will be paid out to all workers at Eskom.”
