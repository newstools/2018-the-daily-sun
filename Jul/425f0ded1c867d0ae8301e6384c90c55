THE Gauteng Human Settlements Department will put the record straight on the rapid land release process proposed by Gauteng Premier David Makhura earlier this year. Human Settlements MEC Dikgang Moiloa will hold summits in the province to outline the process for the establishment of community participatory development forums. He will also spell out the department’s response to the demand for land and housing. The summits will also look at state ownership and the issue of land expropriated without compensation. Moiloa issued a strong warning to criminals who take advantage of the landless by taking their money and promising them land through illegal means and land grabs. “We encourage the arrest of shack lords who mislead our people by pretending the land on which they built shacks belongs to them. “The department will work with law enforcement agencies to stem the tide of shack farming,” he said. He called on cops and the JMPD to use the Criminal Matters Amendment Act to protect land which is earmarked for development by the department of human settlements.
