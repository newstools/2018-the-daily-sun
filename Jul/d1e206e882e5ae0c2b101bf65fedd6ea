TWO elderly people were left injured during a cash in transit robbery thursday morning. A 75-year-old gogo and madala, believed to be in his 70s, were innocent bystanders when four armed men in balaclavas attacked a G4S van in Mthatha, Eastern Cape. Police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said the robbers were all armed with pistols. “They fired shots which wounded the elderly people but no one was reported dead. The guards were delivering money to the FNB in town when the shooting happened. “An undisclosed amount of money and one pistol was taken from the security guards.” Koena said the thugs were driving a silver Toyota Etios with no number plate as a getaway car and sped off after taking the money. She said on Saturday, four men armed with pistols robbed guards from the same company in Ngqeleni when two of them were coming out of a local bottle store. She said there had also been attacks in Tsolo and in these incidents, there were also four robbers. “It’s clear it is the same foursome and we need to work hard to catch them. “We are calling on members of the public who may have information to come forward and assist us.” Anyone with information is urged to visit their nearest cop shop or contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
