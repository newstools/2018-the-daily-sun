THESE college students are SunHeroes! Students from Motheo TVET College in Bloemfontein got down and dirty to build madala Molefi Lejara (109) a big house. The students are studying building and civil construction and started building in September. The madala from JB Mafora kasi in Mangaung lived in a shack, which was in bad shape. A councillor identified him as someone in need of help. Molefi received his a fully furnished, new five-roomed house on Sunday. Motheo College spokesman Lame Morubane said the move formed part of the Nelson Mandela Centenary celebration. “Students who are part of the building and civil construction learnership built the house. “They were assisted by the Diteboho Group construction company,” said Morubane. The house has two bedrooms, a kitchen and bathroom. It was fitted with a fridge, beds, sofas, wardrobes and a TV stand. The house is worth R300 000. Panasonic donated building material while Khatho Projects helped with the house plan. Principal Dipiloane Phutsisi donated curtains and bedding while the college donated the furniture. When the SunTeam arrived at the madala’s new home, a church choir was entertaining guests. The madala told Daily Sun: “I want to thank the students for their good work. When I die, my coffin should be white in colour because I will really be resting in peace.” Molefi’s daughter-in-law, Malerato (51), said she was very excited for him. “He will now be warm during winter and cool in summer. We are very happy and thank all those who played a part in this initiative,” she said.
