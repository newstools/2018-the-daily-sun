ENOUGH is enough! These were the words of gatvol residents of Ga-Rankuwa, zone 4 in Tshwane. The residents say they are sick and tired of rubbish piling up in Neo Rakale’s yard. They say he must either clean up his yard or get out of the kasi! Neo (35) has been collecting rubbish for about two years and it is piling up in his yard. “We are living in filth. The place is a pigsty,” said an angry neighbour, Daniel kgokane (51). “I can’t even take a walk down the street. The smell is so bad.” Daniel said Neo had turned his yard into a dump. “We have pleaded with him to do something about it, but he doesn’t listen,” he said. Another neighbour, Patience Moloko (49), said: “We can’t continue living like this. We have raised our concerns with the councillor but nothing has happened. “This has been going on for more than a year and the rubbish keeps piling up. We are also worried about our kids’ health.” She said kids play there and it was not safe. “I am sure there are snakes somewhere in the rubbish and we can’t enjoy our food because of the smell. We can’t even keep our yards clean because papers blow everywhere,” she said. The residents said they were afraid of having visitors over because their kasi looked like an informal settlement. Neo told Daily Sun: “I collect rubbish to sell at recycling centres. This is how I make a living. It helps me to feed myself. No one has the right to tell me what to do in my yard.” He collects bottles, papers, plastic, metal and clothes. Councillor Jabu Rammushi said he was aware of the matter and that they had tried to intervene. “My team and I went there and gave him dustbins for his rubbish. We have also cleaned the yard but he continues to pile up rubbish,” said Rammushi.
