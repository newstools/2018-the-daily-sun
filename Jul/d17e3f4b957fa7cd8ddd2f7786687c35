SECTION P residents in Soshanguve say the fight between the Jukulyne and MaJukulyn gangs has spilled over into their homes. People hide whenever the feared Jukulyne gang enters their kasi in Tshwane and three men from different families have had to leave home to hide. Recently a shack was torched, two houses damaged and a car window broken. People were even too afraid to open cases. When Daily Sun went to a damaged house on Wednesday, the owner fled, only returning upon hearing who it was. Tshepo Kgobotlo said the war began on Sunday at a social club. He said his brother and two friends from the MaJukulyn gang had a gun pointed at them when they met. He said the other gang members demanded they mourn with them at their friend’s funeral, blaming them for his death. “After that, the three thought it was over until Tuesday, when a neighbour phoned to tell me Jukulyne members were trashing my home. “This is not my brother’s house but our family home. “Why didn’t they trash his rented room?” he asked. The gang then apparently went to another shack, thinking it was where rival members lived and torched it, before trashing another home. Tshepo said Jukulyne members are looking for him because he opened a case. “This is not a mafia state. “I will go to the authorities if thugs terrorise me,” he said. One member’s father told the SunTeam he wants to leave the area. “Whenever I meet the rival gang, I have to go on my knees and apologise for my son. This isn’t how life should be.” Captain Stephen Maluleka said four cases were opened.
