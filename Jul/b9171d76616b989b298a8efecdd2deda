PEOPLE who use the bridge to cross to the train station in Somerset West, Western Cape were frightened on Tuesday morning. A man’s body was found at a business park nearby that morning, three months after another body was found under the bridge. Xolelwa Mafilika said: “No one wants to walk alone in the morning. “Taxis in Strand are expensive, yet they travel short distances compared to other areas like Khayelitsha, so we choose to walk.” Police found a bloody rock at the scene that may have been used to crush the man’s face. Resident Luthando Mjikelo said they recently held a meeting and decided to arm themselves. “People hide under that bridge to rob us and we decided to carry weapons to work. Every man has a duty to protect any woman they see walking alone.” They also asked for more police visibility in the area, while Luthando urged people to walk in groups. “You even see strangers start up a conversation and walk together to work, because we aren’t safe,” he said. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said: “A murder case is under investigation after the body of an unidentified man was discovered on Tuesday morning. “Circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation.” Police ask anyone with information that might lead to an arrest in this case to contact them.
