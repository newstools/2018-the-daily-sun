SEEING people with picks and shovels digging near the electricity substation, residents thought Eskom workers were working overtime. But they were thugs stealing copper cables from the new substation! On Friday night, the thugs dug under the fence that protects the station at Thembokwezi Square in Mandalay, Cape Town. Residents mistook the evil thugs for Eskom workers because they wore uniforms. Slindokuhle Mgodeli (35) from Khayelitsha told Daily Sun: “I passed by on Friday night and saw people wearing overalls, digging near the substation, but wasn’t stressed. “I just thought they were Eskom workers doing their job. I only heard today those people were thugs.” Residents said the substation wasn’t operational yet. A woman resident said: “It’s new but these thugs stole equipment even before it started working. “At least they didn’t destroy the one we currently use. “We would have been in trouble since we wouldn’t have had electricity.” Residents said the area has seen an increase in burglaries and break-ins. Vandalism on the substation happened just streets away from Sivile Primary School, which was broken into last week. Another resident said: “This place is becoming unsafe. “We never used to have break-ins but now it’s happening on a daily basis. We have to do something about it.” At the time of going to print, the SunTeam had received no response from Eskom despite sending a request for comment regarding the situation on Wednesday.
