NEIGHBOURS of the woman who was allegedly killed by her fiance on Sunday said even though the young lovers were close to marriage, their relationship had problems. Londiwe Bhengu (26) and Sphesihle Nxele (27) from Maswazini, near Pietermaritzburg, were found dead in Sphesihle’s home on Sunday. Sphesihle allegedly called Londiwe and asked her to bring his church beads. But when she arrived, he allegedly shot her before turning the gun on himself. Londiwe’s neighbour said their love turned sour at the beginning of the year but said it wasn’t clear what they were fighting about. She said Sphesihle, who was a paramedic, and unemployed Londiwe, had been together for a few years. “Even though she was not open about it, we all noticed that she was starting to lose weight,” said the neighbour. “When we asked her she would only say things were not going well. In March, we heard that the two families had a meeting where their fights were discussed.” She said after that meeting, Londiwe had began buying gifts for umabo, the ceremony in which a bride gives gifts to the family of her husband. “We thought everything had gone back to normal.” When Daily Sun contacted Londiwe’s aunt, Ntombenhle, she said: “There is nothing we are going to say regarding the incident because either way, we know that journalists write what they like.” KwaZulu-Natal police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident.. “Taylor’s Halt police found the bodies of a woman and man lying on the bed with fatal gunshot wounds. “A 27-year-old man allegedly shot his girlfriend in the left cheek before turning the gun on himself. “An inquest docket and a murder case were opened at Taylor’s Halt cop shop for investigation,” said Gwala.
