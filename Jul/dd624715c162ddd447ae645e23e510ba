THEY could only watch helplessly as technicians came and cut their electricity. And now the residents of Roosenekal Village in Sekhukhune, Limpopo, are still waiting for feedback as to what the future holds. Community leader Jacob Mothupi said the municipality was still debating problems of illegal connections and card problems when the technicians came and disconnected the whole village from the grid. “What surprised us is that they cut the power while we were still waiting for a council resolution to give us a way forward. “We wanted to know if we should continue with the temporary system or if they would come up with a new one,” he said. Jacob said the system was giving them problems as it rejected some cards. Mothupi said they had expected officials to give them feedback after they raised the matter with them last month, but instead their cables were cut and removed without any explanation on Thursday. He said residents were now threatening to protest. “Officials promised the mayor would come to us but that never happened. Instead of bringing the mayor or fixing the system, they leave us in the dark. About 450 households are without electricity,” he said. However, the complaints were denied by the municipal spokesman, Simon Makua. He said the residents whose electricity was cut off had tampered with the system to avoid buying electricity. “The municipality’s system assists those who cannot afford to pay by giving them the opportunity to register as indigent in order to be provided with free monthly units,” said Makua.
