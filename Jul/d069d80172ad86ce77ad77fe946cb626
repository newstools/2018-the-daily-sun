FORMER ANC councillor Vincent Kunju believes bullets fired during a shooting spree in Phoenix were meant for him. Kunju from Ohlange, north of Durban, said innocent residents almost died. “I believe I was the target and some residents were affected because they were with me,” he said. About 20 residents including Kunju were shot and injured, allegedly by Metro police, on their way back from a meeting on Thursday afternoon. Kunju told Daily Sun he believed the cops were instructed by councillor Tsigbo Phohlo to shoot at them. He said issues between him and Phohlo began during the local government elections. “I was an independent candidate. I didn’t win and residents who supported me have been victimised. “Phohlo goes around saying I’m the reason people don’t respect him and eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede.” He said they were waiting at a branch general meeting when Metro police arrived and took pictures of them. A resident took pictures of the cops. “The cops took the resident’s cellphone. There was chaos, but it was later resolved. The meeting was cancelled,” he said. They then went to another meeting in Phoenix. “There were about 50 Metro cars. A woman told me she heard the Metro cops were planning to shoot us when we leave,” he said. He said he told other members and they decided to leave. “They shot at us while we were on the road. One resident was shot and he’s in hospital,” said Kunju. Phohlo said Konju isn’t a target. “On Thursday some of his friends arrived carrying knobkerries, which isn’t allowed in meetings,” he said. He said they were beaten because they clashed with cops. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of attempted murder was opened.
