Wilderness Foundation Africa’s COO Matthew Norval has
called for “urgent attention” to the pandemic of poaching. This comes after two white rhino were killed in the
Eastern Cape. According to Eastern Cape police’s Colonel Sibongile
Soci, the rhinos were killed and dehorned at Shamwari Rivate Game Reserve near
Port Elizabeth. This is the third poaching incident in the region in two
weeks, Soci said. The first incident took place in the Kirkwood area on 21
June, where one rhino was killed. The second incident happened at Kragga Kamma game reserve
in Port Elizabeth the following week. “It is unclear when the incident exactly happened, but it
is suspected that it happened a few days ago,” Soci said. Acting Eastern Cape provincial Police Commissioner Major
General Andre Swart said the police will continue to urge game owners to be
vigilant. “We share sympathy with the Reserve and others that are
losing rhinos,” Norval said. “We will continue working alongside law enforcement
agencies and other organizations to combat poaching.” Norval told Daily Sun that white rhino poaching is a
symptom of “a wider global phenomenon.” “It is an
important challenge to conservation that requires our urgent attention,” he
said. According to Save The Rhino statistics, more than 7245
African rhinos have been lost to poaching from 2007 to 2017.
