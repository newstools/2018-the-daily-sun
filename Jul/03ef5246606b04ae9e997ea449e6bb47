MPUMALANGA police killed an illegal miner during a shoot-out at Lily Mine outside Barberton. The incident happened on Sunday afternoon after the mine’s security guards reported that they were attacked by a group of armed men on Saturday. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told Daily Sun the guards called the police after the attack. The cops responded quickly. But while they were patrolling the area, the zama zamas started shooting at them. One illegal miner died and another was injured, while two of them were arrested. Hlathi said the rest managed to escape. “We recovered four firearms and investigations are continuing. “We strongly condemn those continue to mine illegally,” he said. “Although they know the dangers of the mine, they carry on coming here.” Hlathi said illegal mining is causing a lot of damage to the country’s economy. “We are working with stakeholders and residents to help bring it to a stop,” he said. “We have told the owners of these mines they need to secure these areas and our operations form part of it.” Cases of attempted murder, possession of firearms and ammunition and dagga possession were opened. The injured zama zama is in hospital under police guard. The two who were bust are being held in custody. They were due to appear at Barberton Magistrates Court yesterday. Last month, police also arrested 113 illegal miners in Evander.
