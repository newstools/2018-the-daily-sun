THE Msimango family is still reeling from shock. A six-year-old disabled member of the family, Khethiwe, was burned to death last Friday in an incident that took place in Winterveld, north of Tshwane. Lettie’s sister, Elizabeth Mohale (64), said Khethiwe’s mum locked her daughter in the shack at night. “While she was away, our 57-year-old crippled brother lit a paraffin stove in his room,” said Elizabeth. “His room is outside and he did not know Khethiwe was inside the shack. “The stove apparently exploded and his mattress caught fire. “He got out and called for help, but the whole shack was already on fire,” she said. Elizabeth said nobody had known that Khethiwe was inside the shack, because it was locked. “The poor kid fought for her life until she couldn’t any more. She was found dead,” she said. Elizabeth said the situation angered the family. Lettie Msimango (33), Khethiwe’s mum herself said that she was overwhelmed: “I feel a lot of pain, because she was my daughter and I loved her,” she said. Ward councillor Ester Mutumane arranged an RDP for the family. “I heard about the tragedy, and because the family was homeless I looked for an abandoned RDP, bought windows and cleaned it up. “I spoke to our project manager and we decided to build the family a house,” said Mutumane. Police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said a case of arson was opened.
