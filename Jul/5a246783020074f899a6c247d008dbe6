A YOUNG girl who was reported missing a month ago in Bhambayi, near Inanda, north of Durban has been found! Nomfundo Shozi (12) was reported missing by her gogo, Fikile, on 22 June. But on Thursday it emerged that she had been visiting her dad in Mayville, where she was found. Gogo told the police that Nomfundo ran away from home, fearing that her mom, Mimi, would beat her for breaking a window. A police source at the Inanda cop shop told Daily Sun that Fikile called them saying she had found Nomfundo at a relative’s house. “She thought the police were going to leave the matter alone, but they insisted on going to the relative’s house, where they found that the relative was actually Nomfundo’s dad,” said the police source. Her other dad, Sboniso Dubazana (31), who was worried sick over her disappearance, was excited when cops told him Nomfundo had been found. He told the cops he would fetch her on Friday so that she would live with him as her mum allegedly beat her a lot. But on his arrival, he was shattered when cops told him that Nomfundo was found with her dad. When Daily Sun called him, he said: “What matters is that she was found alive. I don’t want to comment further.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “We can confirm that the missing person was found in the Mayville area and reunited with her family.”
