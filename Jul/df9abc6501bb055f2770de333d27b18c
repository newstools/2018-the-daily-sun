AMAZULU are convinced that for now, the seven players they have signed are enough quality to lead them to greater heights in the upcoming PSL season. Usuthu will unveil those players today, with former Bafana Bafana and Bidvest Wits goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs, defender Marc Van Heerden from Orlando Pirates and midfielder Nhlanhla Vilakazi from Free State Stars expected to be there. The current transfer window is set to close on the last day of August and according to AmaZulu’s Brilliant Mkhathini, they are satisfied with what they have signed. At the same event the Durban club will also launch their new kit after they secured a new technical sponsorship from Umbro. Said Mkhathini: “As far as new players are concerned, this is it, no one else is coming. For now we will unveil those seven players only. The team started training camp this week and are expected to come back on Tuesday.” Argentian forward Emiliano Tade (from Auckland City in New Zealand), Xolani Silawuli (centre-back from NFD side Uthongathi FC), Boiki Modisakeng (right fullback from Platinum Stars) and Charlie Hlalele (midfielder from Orlando Pirates) are the other four players to be paraded to the media today. The other player who will be plying his trade at AmaZulu again is right full-back Thembela Sikhakhane. Sikhakhane’s mother club Pirates agreed to loan the defender back to Usuthu, making it his second loan stint at the club after having helped the Durban side finish the past season in the top eight – in their first season back from the NFD. To make way for the new faces, Usuthu have transferred listed four players they deemed surplus to requirement – left-back Simphiwe Mtsweni, midfielders Zola Jingxi, Boysen Mbatha and Nkanyiso Zungu, who spent last season on loan at NFD side Jomo Cosmos. They also loaned out Lungelo Dlamini to Royal Eagles and Sibongiseni Mthembu to Uthongathi, while Menzi Ndwandwe, Mpendulo Dlamini and Sealot Williams also saw their contracts terminated.
