CHARLIE Moyambo was only 26 years old when he died in his brother’s arms on the way to hospital on Sunday. And according to his brother Johannes, the people who killed him were cops! Johannes told Daily Sun that Charlie was shot in the chest while standing in his yard in L and J squatter camp, Oliefantsfontein, Ekurhuleni. “I was walking to the yard when I saw him staring at a crowd of protesters being dispersed by the police. He suddenly fell down and when I ran to him, I realised he had been hit by a stray bullet. “We rushed him to the hospital but he died in my arms. He was not even part of the protest.” Ekurhuleni Concerned Residents Association member Lucky Chauke said the residents were on the way to a community meeting to discuss the release of residents arrested last month for invading nearby land. “Police and Metro cops came and instructed people not to hold the meeting. An argument started and the cops started firing rubber bullets but they soon switched to live ammunition,” he said. Ekurhuleni Metro police spokesman Wilfred Kgasago said the residents had been invading land for two months and this had triggered the trouble on Sunday. He said at this stage, reports of live ammunition being used were just allegations. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the police were investigating the incident. He said cops were on the scene to monitor the situation. Meanwhile, the EFF has called on Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina and Gauteng Premier David Makhura to make sure there is justice.
