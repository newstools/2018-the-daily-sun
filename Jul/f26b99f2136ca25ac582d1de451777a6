A KASI family is in shock following a mysterious blaze that destroyed their dining-room. The Modutoanes from Meadowlands, Soweto, said they woke up to flames inside their dining-room on Wednesday morning. Gogo Ida Modutoane said she was awoken by her 16-year-old granddaughter’s screams. “My granddaughter was sleeping on the couch when the fire started,” said Ida. “I’ve no idea what may have caused the blaze. What happened is very strange. “All the plugs are fine and the heater was off. “We’ve never experienced anything like this before.” Ida said her granddaughter stayed up all night watching TV. “We left her on the couch. We just covered her with a blanket because we had to switch off the heater.” The gogo said they were lucky to be alive. “Had it not been for my granddaughter’s screams, maybe the fire would have killed us,” she told Daily Sun. “Our neighbours helped us kill the blaze with buckets of water. “We did call the police and firefighters, but they didn’t come.” Ida said she’d be grateful if SunLanders could help them fix their room. “We will accept any form of help because we don’t have money,” she she told the People’s Paper.
