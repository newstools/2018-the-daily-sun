LIFE is hard for Danny Morudu. The 52-year-old from Mamelodi East section 16, Tshwane lives in a backyard shack and survives on hand-outs. A car crash in 2015 left him paralysed from the waist down and after being discharged from hospital, his relatives allegedly denied him access to his late father’s house. “My relatives and I have been fighting for my late dad’s house since then. “I’ve been served with protection orders and have spent some time in jail,” he said. Danny said he was involved in an accident while selling copies of Daily Sun in 2015. He has been using crutches since the crash. He said he applied for a disability grant after the incident. “I often get a grant for six months or a year and then I have to reapply. “While I’m waiting for the grant life is really difficult. I have no choice but to beg for food from neighbours,” he told Daily Sun. He said at the moment he didn’t have money to renew his grant. “I owe taxi drivers a lot of money. I hope a Good Samaritan will offer me a a lift or lend me R20 to go and reapply for a disability grant.” He said it was hard living in a shack while his dad’s house was still there. “The shack is very cold. The house that my father left me stands locked while I continue to suffer.” Danny said he wished that the fight for the house would be over so he could go back home. “Residents have helped me a lot and right now they are helping me to get back into the house. “I pray that the fighting will be over one day. I need peace,” he said. Attempts by the People’s Paper to speak to his relatives failed as their phones were on voicemail. Sassa spokesman Kgomoco Diseko, said Danny could be on a temporary disability grant. “Recipients of disability grants are usually on medication and if their condition has improved, they don’t get the grant. “But if their situation remains the same, they should reapply,” Diseko said.
