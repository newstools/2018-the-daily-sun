A Thohoyandou taxi owner was shot dead outside his home on
Wednesday. The taxi owner reportedly parked his car at the gate of his
house, when a witness said they then heard several gunshots outside. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the 65-year-old
was gunned down by unknown suspects who drove away in a Toyota Yaris with
Gauteng registration numbers. “The police were called to the scene and the manhunt ensued.” Ngoepe said the motive behind the assassination is not clear
at this stage but taxi violence could not be ruled out. He urged anyone with information which can assist the police
in arresting the suspects involved in this matter, to contact Captain Richard
Boshomane at 079 894 5501. The suspects are still unknown and are no arrests made yet. The SAPS Provincial Commissioner of Limpopo Lt-General Nneke
Ledwaba said he is disgusted with the ongoing taxi violence in the province. “These criminals are going to be hunted down and dealt with harshly
and without compromise," said Ledwaba.
