THE Ngceba family from Lwandle in Strand, near Cape Town has been living in the dark for a month now. The family and their neighbours who live close to Pholile squatter camp are pleading with the municipality to connect them to another transformer because they are tired of living in the dark because of izinyoka. Lubabalo Ngceba (61) said: “That transformer should just be given to izinyoka because they have made it theirs. They threaten us when we remove their wires. I am too old to be fighting. Life is difficult without electricity.” The family said they had to buy a gas stove and paraffin lights and said their electrical appliances have been damaged. Ntombizodwa Ngceba (54) said: “We can’t buy in bulk now because food gets spoilt and we have to throw it away. I can’t watch my favourite TV shows and the children sometimes bath in cold water before school.” One of the izinyoka said: “Everyone needs electricity, including us. We cannot wait until they finish the installation because we don’t know when that will be.” Informal settlements, water and energy MMC Councillor Xanthea Limberg said: “The electricity network feeding the Ngceba family has been severely affected by illegal connections. These connections were removed but soon reconnected, causing the network to trip.” Limberg said residents receiving an illegal supply would not remove the connections of their own free will. “City staff are at risk when undertaking the removal of connections without a security escort. It is important that consumers report outages to the fault reporting centre to ensure the duration of outages is minimised,” said Limberg. “The city is also doing load studies to determine whether it is technically possible to feed Siyabonga Street from another transformer.”
