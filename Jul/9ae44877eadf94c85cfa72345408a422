EVER since she was a little girl, her dream was to become a top model. And while most people change their minds as they grow up, Mmathabang Meluto found herself drawn to the world of modelling even more. Last year, the grade 12 pupil at Retief High School in Kestel, in Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality was crowned Miss Congeniality. She didn’t say thank you and stop there. Mmathabang went on to become a part and parcel of the municipal display at every event held. The 18-year-old from Namahadi kasi in QwaQwa, Free State told Daily Sun: “I compete in beauty pageants with a purpose. I want to express myself and serve the community in my own way.” She said when she was young, she would stay in front of a mirror for hours, painting her nails and arranging her hair. “Growing up in the community where opportunities don’t come every day held me back. But I still made it,” she said. Mmathabang hopes to enrol for a B Com degree next year next year, but promised not to give up modelling. “Modelling is not about expensive dresses and weaves but about the inner you,” she said.
