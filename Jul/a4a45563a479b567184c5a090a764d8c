THE Midrand Magistrate court has found Busisiwe "Cici"
Thwala not guilty on assault charges that were laid against her. Cici was found not guilty on Monday afternoon after Kwaito king Arthur

to end the relationship with him and also pack up her belongings. Arthur would not let her go, insisting they talk about the issues
they were having. He then took her phone and got into his car. This is when she ran after him and grabbed ahold of the driver’s
door, but Arthur just started the car drove off while she was holding on to the
door, dragging her for about 300 meters. The singer has had to undergo pelvic surgery as a result of the
altercation.
