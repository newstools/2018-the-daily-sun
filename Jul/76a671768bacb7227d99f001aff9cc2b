Cassper Nyovest has given us a rare glimpse into his family life. So far, all we have seen of the rapper’s family are his parents, whom he has been so proud to have blessed with a house and a few cars. But he recently let us in on someone else who is dear and near to his heart, his granny. “Came to see Grandma this weekend. She’s been heavily ill. She lost her speech after getting a stroke,” Cassper said. He also share what he misses most about days gone by with his gran. “I miss the way she used to tell me the same stories about me growing up and how naughty I was. I would act like it’s the first time she tells me the story. Eish, Magogo,” he went on. Fans have flooded the rapper’s comment section with messages of well wishes and encouragement. Fellow musicians including Mafikizolo’s Theo Kgosinkwe also sent their best wishes to Cassper and his gran. Came to see Grandma this weekend. She’s been heavily ill.
