A DAD saved the day when his wife fell ill after giving
birth by nursing his baby girl with the help of a fake nipple. According to New
York Post, Maxamillian Neubauer (29) from Wisconsin, America believed as
his wife, April (24) did in the importance of a newborn kid immediately having
skin-to-skin contact with its loved ones. But April’s plan to put her new baby straight on her
naked breast after birth fell to pieces when she suffered multiple seizures
during an emergency C-section last week and had to be rushed into ICU. When Nurse Cybil Martin-Dennehy at Door County Medical Center
said there was a way Maxamillian could nurse his baby daughter, Rosalía, he
leapt at the chance. A suction cup fixed the fake nipple on to Maxamillian’s
chest. Formula was then fed through a tube, through the fake nipple and into
the mouth of the suckling baby. Maxamillian told People:
“Seeing as I’m not an expert at breastfeeding, it was a little bit awkward at
first. I’m really happy I had a couple of nurses there who knew what they were
doing. “I never thought in a million years that I would ever be
breastfeeding a baby. The minute they brought her out, it was hard to hold back
the tears. It was instant love, it’s my baby. “I was just really happy I could be there for her. It was
awkwardly magical.” April told People:
“I’m definitely happy and very grateful that he was willing to do that and not
opposed to doing it like most other dads would be. He knew how important it
would be to me and to us. Knowing my husband and how he is and his personality,
it didn’t surprise me.”
