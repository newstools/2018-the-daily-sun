The PSL is fighting back! The league's executive committee have resolved to seek leave to appeal Judge Fisher's ruling that annulled the promotion play-offs after Ajax Cape Town took the matter to the high court. Ajax were challenging the decision to have them lose nine points from matches they played using Tendai Ndoro who was deemed ineligible to play after having played for two clubs with overlapping seasons with the PSL. "Following a meeting in Joburg today, PSL Executive Committee resolved to seek leave to appeal the judgement handed down by Judge Fisher of the Gauteng High Court on the 2 July 2018," a statement from league read. The league's Exco held a meeting in Joburg today where National Soccer League (NSL) members were invited to an extra-ordinary board of governors meeting in Ekurhuleni on 12 July. Judge Fisher's ruling has reinstated Ajax back to 15th position on the log where the Cape Town club are calling for the play-offs to be replayed. In the judgment, Judge Fisher ordered that the nine points lost by Ajax be returned to them immediately, as the decision to take them was not proper. At this time, Black Leopards, who won the play-offs, are preparing for life in the Premiership while Jomo Cosmos, who came second, are watching the whole drama like hawks as it holds an opportunity for them. Suggestions have been thrown about that the league be increased to 18 teams to cater for 2017-18 NFD champions Highlands Park, Ajax, Leopards and Cosmos. The process could delay kick-off of the 2018 19 Absa Premiership season, which might come costly for league sponsors. Some club chairmen who spoke to SunSport on condition of anonymity said they cannot afford to wait for the replay the play-offs as their plans are already afoot for kick-off of the new season.
