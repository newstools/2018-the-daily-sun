AMAZULU head coach Cavin Johnson is a happy man! Johnson believes he has assembled a strong squad for the 2018-19 Absa Premiership season set to kick off this coming weekend. The KwaZulu-Natal side host Wedson Nyirenda’s Baroka FC in their first league match at Umlazi’s King Zwelethini Stadium on Saturday (8.15pm). Usuthu also come into this clash full of confidence after lifting the KZN Premiers Cup on Sunday following a 1-0 victory over National First Division side Richards Bay in Umlazi. “The way our preparations for this season have been going makes me smile all the time,” said the 59-year-old. “We won many games during the pre-season and the players understand our tactics well. Even the new players have adapted very well. That’s why I am so happy with the team. We are looking forward to the new season. We are just finalising our last preparations this week.” He added: “Winning the KZN Premiers Cup has further lifted the boys’ spirits ahead of the weekend clash.” Johnson has also warned Bakgaga to expect a tough clash as they aim to collect points early in the season and will use their home ground advantage. “We always start the season with a win and expect to do the same this weekend,” he said. “We cannot afford to lose this game. We are playing at home and can’t disappoint our fans. “I am sure Baroka will give us a good game, but we have to fight for the three points as it will boost us going into the next game and the season ahead.” The former SuperSport United and Platinum Stars coach has so far signed Marc van Heerden (Orlando Pirates), Moeneeb Josephs (Bidvest Wits), Nhlanhla Vilakazi (Free State Stars) and the Argentinian striker, Emiliano Tade. “The new boys have adapted well and will add value to the team,” said Johnson.
