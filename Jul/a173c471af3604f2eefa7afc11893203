FAMILY members of gogo Makabane Magubane said they were relieved when they got news that their missing gogo was seen alive and well. But their excitement was short-lived because when they went to fetch their gogo on Wednesday, they couldn’t find her. The 71-year-old gogo from Izingolweni in Port Shepstone went missing on 30 June at the annual July gathering of the Ebuhleni Nazareth Baptist Church in Inanda, north of Durban. Her granddaughter Nikiwe Magubane (35) said her gogo was last seen walking around in Ebuhleni. Nikiwe said their hopes of finding her alive were raised last Tuesday when they were told by a resident in Ebuhleni that he had seen her at Verulam taxi rank and taken her to the police station. “When we showed him gogo’s photo, he confirmed that it was her. “We were happy but when we arrived at the police station we were shocked that she wasn’t there. “The police officers we found at the charge office said they hadn’t seen her as they had just arrived for their morning shift. “We asked around at the police station but no one had seen her. “This is very sad because we don’t know where she has gone. We went around Verulam looking for her but we couldn’t find her. The problem is that she cannot speak properly,” said Nikiwe. She said they still hoped to find her alive. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed that a missing person’s docket was opened at Inanda Police Station for investigation. “We appeal to anyone with information to contact Inanda police on 031 510 9904,” said Mbhele.
