GOGO Nelisiwe Khoza (65) and her family, from KwaDlangezwa in Empangeni, northern KZN have been living in a mud house for 15 years. Gogo Khoza said they always feared the house would cave in on them. But their lives changed for the better on Wednesday when they were given the keys to a beautiful new house. It was built by a donor, who was approached by the Umhlathuze Municipality. Gogo Khoza said she never imagined ever owning such a beautiful house. “I can’t even hold back my excitement. I can’t believe this donation is indeed a reality. I will know how it feels to sleep peacefully, without worrying that the wind might blow the house down.” Gogo Khoza said she lived with eight members of her family. “Some nights we would toss and turn in bed because the wind would come into the mud house through the holes in the wall. “There was nothing I could do because my pension was too little. “It only covered the basic things such as groceries. None of my children is working,” she said. Mayor Mdu Mhlongo said the ward councillor told them the Khoza family was in dire need of a house. “We found a donor who happily funded the construction. The house was also fully furnished with all the necessities such as beds, a stove, fridge, microwave and sofas to restore the family’s dignity.” Mhlongo said helping the family was their way of honouring Nelson Mandela’s legacy during his birthday month.
