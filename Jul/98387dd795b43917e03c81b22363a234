Ajax Cape Town's urgent interdict to halt the start of the 2018/19 Premier Soccer League season will be heard on Thursday morning (11:30am)  at the South Gauteng High Court. Judge Denise Fischer's will first hear the PS leave to appeal at ( 9am) on Thursday. They are appealing her decision to set aside Advocate William Mokhari's ruling. Mokhari’s ruling sent shock waves through South African football when he docked Ajax points and saw them automatically relegated to the National First Division for fielding an ineligible player. The PSL have already released fixtures for the upcoming season, which begins on 4 August, however, these fixtures did not include Ajax despite the matter being unresolved and still being fought in courts. Ajax and the PSL have been at each other’s throats since the start of the year and have frequently involved legal institutions in the last four months, including courts of law – which goes against Fifa’s recommendations on ways to resolve football matters.
