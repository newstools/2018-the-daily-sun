A GRIEVING mum-of-two who was preparing to bury her
husband was struck again by tragedy when fire ate her house. According to The
Jamaican Gleaner, Lorraine Bennett (36)
had been doing her washing about 1.30pm last Saturday in her yard in the village
of Ivor Cottage in St Elizabeth, Jamaica. Suddenly she heard people screaming for her, telling her
that her hut was going up in flames. There was no time to call the fire brigade as the hut was
reduced to ashes in minutes. Lorraine told the Gleaner
that she and her two kids – aged 13 and 16 – had lost everything, including her
life savings of about R800 000 in cash. The poor widow is now depending on support from her
community and the government to get herself and her kids back on their feet.
