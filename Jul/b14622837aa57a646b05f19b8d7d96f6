Two days after gogo Nowayilesi Cila asked, people responded! Gogo Nowayilesi’s story was published in Daily Sun last Thursday in which she said she wanted a big bash for her 100th birthday. Her wish came true when local business owners opened their hearts. They rocked up at her house in Kuyasa, Khayelitsha on Sunday armed with a sound system, food hampers, meat, sausages and cakes to party in style. The cherry on top was a relaxing full body massage from the owner of Ascendis Health Spa, Lumka Mpayisi. Lonwabo Dandala from Goal Supermarket said: “We have to take care of our citizens and it’s also our way of giving back to the community. This gogo deserves to be celebrated.” Tavern owner Fumanekile Ndumela from Khwezi said he was touched by the story. “When I saw the story in Daily Sun I took a decision to help. “It is a blessing to all of us.” Gogo’s daughter Buyelwa Cila (64) said: “We never expected this to happen to our mother. We are thankful to Daily Sun and all those who made sure that she celebrated in style.”
