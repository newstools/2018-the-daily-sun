THREE people were killed and another one seriously injured after
a shooting incident outside a shop on Second October Street in Tembisa, on
Wednesday afternoon. ER24’s Russel Meiring said when paramedics arrived at the
scene they found a taxi parked outside a small shop. “The bodies of two men were found lying in the taxi while a
third was found lying a few metres away,” Meiring said. Meiring said the paramedics assessed the patients and found
that they had sustained numerous gunshot wounds and showed no signs of life. “Unfortunately, nothing could be done for them and they were
declared dead.” He said a fourth man was treated and transported to a nearby
hospital. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known, but
the police are on the scene for further investigations.
