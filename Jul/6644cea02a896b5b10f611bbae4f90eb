YOU need to service your car regularly. If your carâ€™s warranty is finished, find a competent and honest mechanic. Be warned: a low cost could mean cheap workmanship. Tips for services - Agree on a date when the work will be completed, with costs, before work starts. - Ask the mechanic to identify other risks before the work starts. - Make sure you get a detailed quote from the workshop before any work starts. - Get the workshop to identify specific repairs or services needed to fix the problems you told them to fix. - Remember that the lowest cost may not be best. If a quote it is too high, get a second quote or find out the cost of the parts at a parts dealer. - Keep track of your repair and service history. It protects you in future and helps your mechanic with his diagnostic process, - If your vehicle is serviced badly by a workshop in a group, you can complain to a higher authority in that group.
