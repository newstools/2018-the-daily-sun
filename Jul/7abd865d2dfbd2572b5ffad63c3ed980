A MUM broke down in court when she came face to face with her daughter’s alleged killer for the first time. Siviwe Khusani (26)is accused of killing Azintle Feni (25) from Motherwell kasi, Port Elizabeth, last month. He appeared in the Motherwell Magistrates Court yesterday. He made an application to access the docket to help him prepare for his bail application. Azintle’s mum, Thembakazi Jack, told the SunTeam: “I want him to rot in jail. He doesn’t deserve to be in society. The whole family is still struggling to come to terms with our daughter’s horrible death. “Even the small children are afraid to go to the shops because they fear they will be abducted.” After his lawyer, Mxolisi Moolman, applied to see the docket, prosecutor Themba Mavakala opposed it, saying he wouldn’t be able to hand the docket over until the investigation was complete. Mavakala said: “The defence has a right to see the docket before the trial in order to prepare. But in this case, we can’t hand it over because the investigation is still at a critical stage and we rely on DNA evidence. “To hand over the docket will jeopardise our case.” After turning down the application, magistrate Gerrie van der Merwe said: “The defence can only access the statements made by the accused, not the docket, as the investigation is ongoing.” Siviwe was arrested last month after Azintle’s burned body was found in a field on Chalumna Street. She disappeared after a party on 16 June. The matter was postponed to Thursday for a formal bail application.
