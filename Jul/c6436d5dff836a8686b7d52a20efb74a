In a shocking revelation, a suspect arrested for a cash-in-transit heist is believed to be an employee of the African National Congress. The suspect is apparently employed at ANC headquarters in Luthuli House, Joburg. According to City of Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba, the suspect is one of four suspects arrested on 6 and 7 July for a heist that occured in Dobsonville, Soweto. A raid was conducted by the JMPD on 7 July, in which four vehicles were recovered. Two of the vehicles were said to be used for the heist. “The arrest of this individual does bring into question whether the ANC has been aware of the arrest of this individual and, if so, why they have remained silent on such an important matter,” Mashaba said. “It also begs the question of how the ANC, while running National Government, can employ individuals who so brazenly undermine public safety and the rule of law in our Country.” Mashaba also said that Mzansi is in the grip of lawlessness. He accused the ruling party of festering a culture of impunity. ANC spokesman Pule Mabe confirmed the arrest. “The African National Congress is dismayed by the fact that one of its employees was arrested and appeared in court allegedly for involvement in serious crimes,” he said. “Crime remains a serious cancer in our young democracy, and we must continue to fight it in whatever of its manifestations. “We support the efforts by the law enforcement agencies to investigate, arrest and charge perpetrators to such high priority crimes,” he said. Mabe also said that the ANC is following its internal disciplinary policy for employees, and will ensure that appropriate action is taken.
