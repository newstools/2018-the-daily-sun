Beware, a new scam is on the loose! TV personality Bonang Matheba has become the latest celebrity whose name is being used to lure people into a scam. People have been encountering a “sponsored” post that seems to be coming from Bonang’s Instagram account when they watch InstaStories. The supposed ad, purports that the queen is giving away R50 000 and that in order to stand a chance to win, fans need only send their name via WhatsApp to a certain number. Queen B first became aware of the scam when a fan tweeted her and asked if it is indeed true. But she quickly made it known that she has nothing to do with the ‘competition’. “If I was giving away money, you’d know. Lol,” she said. She’s also since shared the fake post onto her InstaStory to warn her fans of the scam.
