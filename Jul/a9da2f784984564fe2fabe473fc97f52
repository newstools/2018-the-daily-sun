HE’S made some stupid mistakes. Solomon Mahaku (46) had been on the run for three weeks after allegedly killing his friend. Then he got sloppy and started selling the victim’s property, including his car, on Gumtree. But his plan never got off the ground as cops were there when the deal went down. Cops pretended to be interested in the car he was selling and arranged to meet him. Solomon readily agreed, thinking he had a buyer, and he fell into the trap. He is accused of stabbing a 37-year-old man to death with a sharp object in Norkem Park, Ekurhuleni. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Mahlodi Langa said the suspect was arrested on Saturday at a filling station in Isando. “He has been charged with murder. He appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrates Court on Monday. He was kept in custody and is expected to apply for bail soon.”
