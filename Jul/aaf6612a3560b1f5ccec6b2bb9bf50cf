SUCCESS comes to those who’re willing to work hard. Take Phetho Makhadi (18), for example. The teenager from Ha-Magidi, Limpopo, used the R200 his mum gave him on his birthday to start a clothing line called FLEX. He said the idea to start a clothing brand came to him in 2016. But he didn’t know how to go about it as he didn’t have any money. He started out by designing caps and posting pictures of them on Facebook. He said the response was overwhelming. “One thing led to another and today I have five cap designs, three T-shirt blueprints and two shoe patterns. “My latest design is the Flex Cruise shoe, which is doing very well,” he said. Phetho said he wanted to show young people their dreams can come true if they set goals. He said he sacrificed his pocket money to keep the business going. Sometimes he travels on foot to deliver his merchandise to clients in town. Phetho is not just a businessman. He’s also a Good Samaritan who wants to change the lives of the people around him. He’s started donating woollen beanies to pupils at Tshilidzini Special School. He said as long as his business is operating, he’ll continue donating beanies. He hopes to become a household name in the near future. “I’d like to see my brand going international and being sold at popular shops.”
