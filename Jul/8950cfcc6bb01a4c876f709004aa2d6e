OVER the past 18 years, traditional surgeon Zenzele Mlunguzi (45) has successfully circumcised hundreds of initiates. “I don’t kill the boys. I turn them into men. My job is a calling,” said Zenzele from Vonqo Village in Dutywa. “My ancestors came to me in a dream and instructed me to circumcise boys. “The first person I circumcised was my brother.” He said none of the initiates he circumcised had died or been hospitalised. He said he did not drink during initiation season. “I ask all initiates for a medical certificate and ID book to check if they’re underage. Parents are also required to give me a consent form,” said Zenzele. Chief Daluvuyo Sihlanu said he’s never had problems with Zenzele. “He obeys the rules. He knows his job very well,” said the chief. Parent Manxenxe Magengelele saidall of Zenzele’s initiates go home in one piece. “Many people have heard about him,” said Manxenxe. “Initiates come from as far as Cape Town to be circumcised.” “We’re expecting all initiates to go home this weekend because schools reopen on Tuesday. “We extend our condolences to those who lost their sons during initiation season. “On the other hand, we’d like to say thanks to those who made sure boys got home safe and sound.” He said Traditional Affairs MEC Fikile Xasa would call local chiefs to an imbizo. “The imbizo is aimed at finding out what can be done to stop the deaths of initiates,” he told Daily Sun.
