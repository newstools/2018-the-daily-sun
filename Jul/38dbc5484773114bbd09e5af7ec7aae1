“WE’RE not going anywhere!” These were the words of residents of Olievenhoutbosch extension 27 in Tshwane. They staged a protest at the weekend after the Gauteng Human Settlements Department threatened to evict them from RDPs they occupied last year. They said they won’t allow outsiders to move into the houses and were prepared to die for their cause. Matshidiso Marakalala (28) said the department had told them beneficiaries were from Mooiplaas. Chev Mojela (40) said residents wanted their grievances to be heard. Peter Seolela (39), the EFF chairman in the area, said the department took residents to court in December but later withdrew the case. But MEC Uhuru Moila had since gone back to court to apply for the residents to be evicted. “In May, they were granted an eviction order but we opposed it. Now they want us evicted even though we appealed the order,” he said. Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga referred questions to the department. MMC Mandla Nkomo said the department and the MEC needed to take responsibility for the protest, which he said was triggered by the eviction order. Gauteng deputy director-general for human settlements, Keith Khoza, said they evicted people last week, in line with a court order. He said the people of extension 27 were actually from Mooiplaas. “We will use law enforcement to restore order,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said six people were arrested for public violence. Makhubele advised motorists whose cars were damaged during the protest to open cases. The suspects will appear in the Pretoria Magistrates Court this week.
