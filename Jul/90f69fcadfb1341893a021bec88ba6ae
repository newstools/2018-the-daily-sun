LIFE has not been the same for the Maseko family since their daughter went missing. Joseph Maseko (42) from Pretoria West said they have been looking for their daughter Khothatso Mokwena (19), since December, when she went missing in Randburg, Joburg. She left behind a six month old baby boy. Joseph said they suspect she could have been kidnapped because she never went anywhere without telling them. Khothatso was last seen wearing red jeans and a white shirt. Apparently she told her mother she was going to work in a hotel but didn’t say which one. She apparently sent a WhatsApp message to her brother on the night of 14 February stating that she was in Randburg with a Nigerian man. She said she couldn’t talk because she didn’t feel safe and switched off her phone while they were chatting. Police circulated information about her in many places. “Now we are hoping the SunReaders can help us find our missing child,” Joseph told Daily Sun. “We have tried calling her many times but the phone no longer rings.” He said Khothatso passed matric with distinctions last year and was expected to study Business Management at Unisa. “Our hearts are bleeding. It hurts even more because she has a small child,” said Joseph. Police spokeswoman Constable Sibongile Vuma said a missing person’s case was opened. “Anyone with information should contact Pretoria West Police Station on 012 3271274, Constable Sibongile Vuma on 072 067 0188 or the family on 082 212 5946.”
