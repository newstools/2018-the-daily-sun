PERCY Maimela (33) fell in love with art at an early age. Percy, who was raised in Winterveld in Tshwane by his gogo, uses salt, pencil and charcoal for his work. “I pour salt on the ground and draw whatever comes to mind,” said Percy. He said he does not compete with other artists but with himself. “I have learned that you are only restricted by your mind,” he told Daily Sun. Percy’s uncle Tladi Maimela said his nephew’s work is amazing. “What Percy does is excellent and completely different. It’s the best I’ve ever seen.” Percy has sold his work at exhibitions and also does salt portraits for people. He has done portraits for companies like T-Systems South Africa and S2 Multimedia. He also created a salt portrait of Joe Mafela after the actor’s death to convey his condolences to the family. Percy said he wants to open a gallery in three years’ time. “I want to be remembered as an unlimited, creative person who was always happy,” he said.
