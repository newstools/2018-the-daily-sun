Goals from Jeremy Brockie and Themba Zwane gave Mamelodi Sundowns a 2-1 win over Kaizer Chiefs in the Shell Helix Ultra Cup at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. With the Carling Black Label Cup taking a break this year because of the World Cup, the inaugural Shell Helix Ultra Cup served as the curtain raiser. Khama Billiat started against his former team for the first time and he proved to be a thorn in their side for much of the first half. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane handed a debut to new boy Lyle Lakay who signed from Cape Town City. Sundowns made 9 changes to the team that lost 1-0 to AS Togo Port in the Champions League. The first half was open with both teams having a go at each other but neither grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck. The teams went into the half time break evenly poised at 0-0. In the second half, both teams appeared in their changed kits, Chiefs debuting their royal purple away kit while Sundowns went back to their traditional yellow and blue. Jeremy Brockie broke the deadlock in the 52nd minute after Anthony Laffor struck the post with a low shot. The New Zealander will be hoping for more of the same when the official Premier Soccer League season kicks off having been unable to register a goal for Masandawana last season. Themba Zwane put the final nail in Chiefs’ coffin in the 90th minute when he extended the Brazilians’ lead. Bernard Parker found the net in stoppage time, a goal that would only serve as consolation.
