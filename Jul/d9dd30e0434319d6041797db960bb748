OVERLOADING might be the cause of a deadly accident that took place on Saturday. Six people, including three children, were killed when a Toyota Venture overturned on the R81 near Ga-Makgoba outside Maseleseleng. The vehicle’s tyre burst, causing the Venture to roll several times. Five people died at the scene, while one was declared dead on arrival in hospital. The vehicle was transporting passengers between Polokwane and Mooketsi. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said: “Three children, one man and two women died. “One of the women was believed to be pregnant,” he said. “The dead are still being identified.” The surviving passengers are receiving medical attention at Mankweng Hospital. Ngoepe said police are investigating a case of culpable homicide. “The cause of the accident is still not clear at this stage. Investigations are under way. “We will give an update.” Limpopo transport spokesman Matome Moremi-Taueatsoala said the department condemned drivers who put passengers’ lives at risk by overloading their vehicles. It is alleged that the vehicle had 17 passengers on board. Moremi-Taueatsoala said: “The preliminary report indicates that the Venture might have been overloaded and was not fit to transport people. “Our officials are working with police to determine whether the passengers are related.”
