A CHINESE man's beach vacay ended in tragedy when he was washed out to sea while taking a selfie of himself and his friend. According to Coconuts, Qiuwei Anhui (46), his wife and their friend on Sunday were visiting the popular Angel’s Billabong Beach at an island off the south eastern coast of Bali called Nusa Penida. Cop I Nyoman Sarjana told Tribun News: "Upon arriving at Angel's Billabong Beach, the victim and his friend, Emeli Seth, a Dutch national, took a selfie with a sea view of the Indian ocean." They were standing on the edge of a 10 meter high cliff to take the photo when a huge wave suddenly crashed over them, dragging them both out to sea. I Kadek Sinta, the group's driver, had witnessed the incident and immediately jumped in to save them.  But he was only able to save Seth, as the rough seas had dragged Anhui too far out. His body was eventually retrieved by rescuers from the Lembongan Dive Centre. A similar nightmare was reported by Coconuts in March, when two tourists taking selfies at the Bali coast were also surprised by large waves which washed them out to sea. The woman was rescued by a snorkeler, but the 23-year-old man was not so lucky.
