 AFRICA’S largest university system the University of South
Africa (UNISA) is celebrating its 145th anniversary. UNISA attracts a third of all higher education students in
South Africa. The university has over 300 000 students, including
international students from over 130 countries worldwide. This makes it one of the world's largest universities and the
only university that has such big enrolment in Africa. UNISA’s method of education is mainly based on distance
education institution. This method of learning gives students flexibility and
choice over what and when they want to learn. “This year Unisa celebrates 145 proud years as a beacon of knowledge and inspiration on the African continent - as a leading light shaping futures, and being illuminated in turn by its partners, its stakeholders and the worldwide community it serves,” the university said. Former SA president and current Unisa chancellor Dr. Thabo Mbeki says all of us should work to live up to the vision of reconstructing UNISA as thee African university. “I am honoured to salute all of those staff, students, management and workers of UNISA, who will be the architects of this outcome,” Dr. Thabo Mbeki said. The university’s graduates include the likes of former
President Nelson Mandela, peace broker on the African continent and Unisa
Chancellor, Thabo Mbeki and humanitarian Yvonne Chaka Chaka and newly elected
President Cyril Ramaphosa.
