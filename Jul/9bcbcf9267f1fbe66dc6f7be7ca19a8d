ZONDEKILE Dimba’s three-roomed house was demolished after her councillor promised her she would get a new RDP, on Mandela Day last year. But that didn’t happen, leaving Zondekile trapped in a tiny rondavel. Things are different this year, and the 88-year-old gogo from Tholeni in Kwa Swayimane, KZN Midlands, is happy. That’s because builders are putting finishing touches, and a roof, to her RDP. Zondekile will move into the house soon. The People’s Paper ran a story about her problem in February, after which construction work resumed. “Every time I looked at my unfinished house, I’d think maybe Mandela Day wasn’t meant for me,” she said. Her neighbour Tholinhlanhla Zulu (30) said:  “Had it not been for the People’s Paper, gogo would still be suffering. “Thank you,  Daily Sun,  for assisting the gogo.” Councillor Musi Mngadi said he had asked local businesspeople to donate building material. “They helped and we hope the roof will be finished this week,” said Mngadi.
