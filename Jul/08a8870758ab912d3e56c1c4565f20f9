Local entertainer Zodwa Wabantu made good on her promise to steal the show at this yearâ€™s Vodacom Durban July just like she always does almost everywhere she goes. The Queen of the dance floor showed up at the races in a black sequence and lace dress that in true Zodwa Wabantu style, left very little to the imagination. Her dress, by Nonkosi Collection, was similar to one once worn by American singer, actress and dancer Jennifer Lopez. While both stars did justice to this dress, Zodwa thinks her body was perfect for the dress and it gave her the edge over J-Lo. However, Who do you think wore it best?  Who Wore it best? I have the meat?? JLO/Zodwa Wabantu???????????????? A post shared by  zodwalibram (@zodwalibram) on Jul 7, 2018 at 11:25pm PDT
