South Africa is struggling against the rising tide of drug use. The latest report from the South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use shows that an alarming 21% to 28% of patients treated for substance abuse in 2016/7 were under the age of 20. Last year, we learnt that Mzansi is one of the top 10 drug and alcohol abusers in the world, with the average age of experimentation being 12 years old. This means that some children in primary school have already started experimenting with drugs and alcohol. Rhys Evans, director at the leading drug and alcohol testing equipment supplier, ALCO-Safe, said although it is a worrying trend, it should also make us wonder what is causing children to experiment. He said it is important to research what kind of effects drugs have on children’s mental and physical development. “More important, what is being done to curb these disturbing numbers?” Arguments aside, the causes for substance abuse seem to be uniform across the board, in private or government schools, regardless of income levels. Dr Joel Shapiro, clinical psychologist at Randburg’s Akeso Crescent Clinic, said most drug abuse stems from an underlying emotional problem. “The core trigger for drug abuse is often an emotional one. “For many youth, it is a sense of alienation, disconnectedness, loneliness or lack of normalcy that often arises in the years following puberty.” Evans said strong communication between schools and parents helps to underpin drug abuse education and awareness. This makes sure all parties are knowledgeable about what drugs are available, what signs to look out for and how to spot potential abuse, as well as the best and most sensitive way to approach possible abusers without frightening them or driving them away.
