“THOU shalt not steal,” reads a passage from the Bible. Many Christians and honest citizens follow this commandment, but thieves who robbed a church have no regard for it. The congregation of Worship Centre Community Church on Sunday were left singing solemnly in their hollow church after thieves stole their music system worth R300 000 on Saturday. The thieves gained entry to the church in Nellmapius extension 4, east of Tshwane, through a back door. Cables, speakers, drums, an amp, microphones, a mixer and keyboards were all pinched. Bishop Jonas Masotla said they were saddened by the thieves’ evil ways. “This church is the centre of the community,” he said. “Memorial services and weddings are held here for free. “We open the church to NGOs seeking to help the community.” Masotla said they struggled through their service on Sunday. “Congregants could not hear me without the speakers and microphones,” he said. “It was very hard but we had to praise God and pray for the thieves’ forgiveness.” He reminded the SunTeam that the Bible instructs that one should forgive a thousand times, and they had forgiven the thieves. Masotla said the church was offering a R10 000 reward to anyone with information that could lead to the recovery of the stolen goods. Silverton police spokesman Captain Jan Sepato said a case of burglary was opened. “No one has been arrested and cops are still investigating,” he said.
