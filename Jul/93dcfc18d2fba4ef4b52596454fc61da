HER daughter was born with a rare condition but she loves her just the same. But the past six years have been stressful for Emma Morulani (46) from Hammanskraal, Tshwane. It is a miracle that Banthatile (6) is still alive as most babies born with the rare Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards’ syndrome, barely survive birth. Trisomy 18 is a genetic disorder caused by an error during a child’s development in the womb. The condition disrupts the normal pattern of development in ways that can be life-threatening, even before the child is born. As if that was not bad enough, the little one also developed a heart disease. Emma said: “I’m happy my daughter is still with me and I believe everything that is happening is God’s will. “But as she grows older, it becomes harder to take care of her. “She is always sick and doesn’t get better. “She can’t talk, walk or eat on her own. “It would one thing if she was just living with a disability but she keeps getting sick.” Emma told Daily Sun their only source of income is Banthatile’s social grant. “I hope someone reads my story and helps my daughter get medical assistance so she can live longer,” she said. A doctor consulted told Daily Sun there is no treatment for Trisomy 18. The doctor said: “We can only manage the complications caused by the syndrome. “This includes treatment for heart problems and upper respiratory tract infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia. “But her prolonged life span will depend on the severity of her condition or complications.”
