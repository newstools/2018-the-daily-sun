PATIENTS and staff members at Montebello Hospital had to duck and dive as they heard gunshots yesterday. This was because an employee was shot dead a few metres away from the hospital premises. Bongani Ngidi (42), who worked as a hospital driver, was shot 13 times and died on the scene. He was gunned down outside the hospital in Ozwatini, KZN, by two men driving a silver Opel Corsa. In the car was an unidentified woman. All three fled the scene. A staff member told Daily Sun: “Most of the staff and patients had just arrived at the hospital as it was still morning. When I entered the reception area I heard gunshots.” People thought the shooting was happening inside the hospital. “I saw patients and colleagues ducking down and trying to dodge the bullets.” She said when the gunshots stopped, they saw Ngidi’s body on the floor. Ngidi’s sister, Nomthandazo Ngidi (32) said they were informed of the incident by the police. “My brother had no enemies which we knew of. We heard there was a woman in the car, so we don’t know whether the murder is related to relationship issues or not,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the motive for the murder was still unknown. “A case of murder has been opened. We urge anyone who might have information to contact the cops.”
