Mboniseni Mgeyane and Senzo Mkhize’s family members are worried about them. The 38-year-old friends have been missing since last Wednesday. They were last seen near a taxi rank at Bhamshela in the Ngcongangconga area of Nsuze, northern KZN. Their families said they left without telling anyone where they were going. Nompumelelo Mgeyane (25), Mboniseni’s sister, said Senzo’s sister from Durban had apparently received a call from him, telling her they were being attacked in Kwa Nodwengu, Ndwedwe. “When he phoned, Senzo apparently told his sister the attackers wanted to kill them. “We haven’t heard from them since and their cellphones are on voicemail. We are all worried,” she said. Nompumelelo said Mboniseni would sometimes sleep at Senzo’s home but he would always come back home the next day. She said they were praying the two friends would be found alive. “Our parents died several years ago. Mboniseni is our eldest brother and he looked after us as his younger siblings. “Not finding him or not knowing if he is okay wherever he is, is killing us inside,” she said. KZN cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said Nsuze cops are appealing to residents to help find the two missing friends. “Mboniseni was wearing a blue jacket with a hoody, dark trousers and navy All Stars sneakers. It’s not known what Senzo was wearing,” said Mbhele. She appealed to anyone who might have information on their whereabouts to contact Nsuze cop shop on 032 696 3735 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
