Strand is the place to be next weekend if you want to catch a massive gospel show with big names. On Saturday, Grabouw-based Elgin FM brought two featured artists to perform in Nomzamo to whet people’s appetites for the event at the community hall on 11 August. Other artists who will be performing are Butho Vuthela, Bethusile Mcinga and Veliswa Skeyi. Marketing manager Hlumisa Ngomane said they wanted to give people an idea of what to expect. “We also wanted to meet listeners, show them our presenters and tell them there will be pastors at the show who will pray for people.” Singer Anele Buka, who won the best street marketing award at the Ingoma Awards, said people should not miss the show. “I am working on a duet album with Onke Jalamba and we will perform some of the songs for the first time at the show.” Anele, who has six albums under his belt, said he will also be promoting his current album. “We sell our albums ourselves and they will be available on the day. My fans must keep supporting and inviting me because there is nothing I enjoy more than singing at their churches,” said Anele. Anele and Onke then performed at the taxi rank for fans. Lusanda Manisi said: “Their singing blesses me and my husband finally saw what I’m always talking about.”
