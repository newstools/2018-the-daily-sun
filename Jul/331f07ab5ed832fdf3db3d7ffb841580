PEOPLE believe a government should be judged by how well it takes care of vulnerable citizens. The patients at Khayelitsha District Hospital in Cape Town who are sleeping on the floor are a prime example of what some see as neglect. This was witnessed by a SunReader who went to visit her father at the hospital after he had been in an accident. Andy Buthane from Khayelitsha claimed when she came back two days later to visit her father, more horror awaited her. The nurses and doctors had allegedly not given him anything to relieve his pain and he was still sitting in a wheelchair. Around him were other patients sleeping on the floor using hospital sheets to cover themselves. “He kept saying he was dying and he was in too much pain. I was so scared that my father would die while sitting there,” she claimed. Andy also claimed there is no privacy at the hospital. “A doctor came to see a patient who was next to my father and asked if he had taken his ARVs. I was shocked because we were not supposed to hear that.” Khayelitsha and Eastern substructure spokesman Sithembiso Magubane said the department was made aware of the situation. He said the hospital serves a large community and experiences high service pressure in the emergency centre. He blamed patients who refuse to remain seated on the chairs provided and chose to lie on the floor. “Recliner chairs and trolley beds are available for all patients who spend the night,” said Magubane.
