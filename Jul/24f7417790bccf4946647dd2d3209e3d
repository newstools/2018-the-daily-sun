ERIC Khoza (30) was sick of his landlord hassling him over electricity. So on Sunday, Eric from Wattville, Ekurhuleni, called his friends and they carried his two-roomed shack out of the yard. The shack was still intact when they left the yard. Many residents came out to laugh and take videos. A motorist who drove past Eric and his friends offered to transport the shack. “My landlord always wanted her tenants to buy electricity every month,” said Eric. “We paid her R600 a month. That amount included electricity, but she always demanded more money. “We paid her an additional R150 every month, and it was too much for us.” Eric moved his shack two streets away from his landlord’s house. He said he didn’t have money for transport because he had to pay his new landlord. “I couldn’t dismantle my shack because putting it back together would have cost more money.” The landlord refused to comment. “This is not important,” she said.
