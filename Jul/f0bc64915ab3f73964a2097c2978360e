SERGEANT Setjakadume Thobejane and three other police officers who saved little Nothando Muntuyedwa (3) from a freezing death were honoured for their bravery on Sunday. When Springs cops were called to save her, they forgot how dangerous Blesbok River was and jumped in to grab her from the clump of grass she was hanging on to. Yesterday, Sergeant Thobejane, Sergeant John Nkuna‚ Constable Samuel Skatane and Constable Solomon Mtshweni from Springs Police Station were honoured at the Incredible Happenings church in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni by prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng. Mboro organised trophies with their names on but said they were going to be delivered to the police station this week. The mother of the girl, Nosiphiwe Muntuyedwa (28), received a grocery voucher worth R2 000 and the church said it would buy clothes for her two children. Mboro said he was touched by the story. He appealed to the police to send the cops for swimming lessons. “There are times when cops are forced to get into deep water. Waiting for divers could cost lives,” he said. Nothando disappeared while playing with other kids at Slovo Park, near Springs. She was at her mother’s friend’s house at the time and was later found in the river. She was spotted by a security guard who notified the cops.
