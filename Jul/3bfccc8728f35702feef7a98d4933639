FISHERMEN saw something strange on Wednesday at a dam in Thokoza, Ekurhuleni. A man of about 28 was seen swimming to the middle of the dam and then disappearing under the water. The fishermen said before walking into the dam, he threw money in the water and sang a traditional song while undressing. “We watched him as he swam until he reached the centre of the dam. “Without showing any sign of struggle, he disappeared under the water,” they said. Two traditional healers who have been at the scene since yesterday said this was a sacred place and claimed the man had been called by the ancestors. Makhosi Nkanyamba said: “This man was called into the dam by his ancestors and if they don’t want him to be found he won’t be found. “Something tells me he is still alive and undergoing uku thwasa initiation. I say this because of what he did before he entered the dam. Nkanyamba said the dam swallows people every September. “The breeze and how the water looks now I remember very well from last September, when a body was found. I told them they would find the body and they did. Now I know this man is in there. I can feel it.” Nkanyamba said the dam should be fenced off for people’s safety, especially kids. Residents said they would perform a small ceremony for ukuphahla to ask the man’s ancestors to reveal the body and help divers succeed in their search. Police divers arrived at the dam on Wednesday after cops were told the man had disappeared. The search will resume at 8am today.
