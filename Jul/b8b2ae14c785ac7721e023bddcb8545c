ON WEDNESDAY, Site B cops from Khayelitsha, Cape Town donated food and clothes to the Bangani family in Taiwan squatter camp. The family lost eight members in a shack fire in May. Daily Sun published their story on 8 May. Lieutenant Nerine Brooks said they heard about the fire. “We understand they still need all the support they can get because losing eight family members at once can’t be easy,” she said. She told the family that as the police, they are with them and feel their pain. “We want to use our 67 minutes for Mandela Day by helping this family because we know he always preached the importance of ubuntu and helping the disadvantaged.” Brooks said the police doesn’t want to be seen as people who only make arrests. “We know we cannot take the pain away but you must know that you are not alone. “We are here,” said Brooks. Surviving family member Yonela Bangani (24), who lost her child, sibling and mother in the fire, told Daily Sun they were grateful for the support. Yonela and her two brothers are the only remaining family members, who are surviving on donations as only one is employed. “We didn’t know people are still thinking about us but are glad police helped us. “Ever since the incident we’ve had help and are forever grateful to those who didn’t forget about us,” Yonela said.
