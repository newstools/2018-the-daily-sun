ONE taxi driver thought that he could escape the arm of the
law. When he saw JMPD vehicles parked on the side of the road during
Operation Buya Mthetho, he made a run for it. But his luck ran out of fuel as he was caught, and his taxi
was impounded! Operation Buya Mthetho is in full swing, and many taxi
drivers operating in Joburg have felt the heat of the law. JMPD Spokesman Wayne Minaar said that on Tuesday 35 taxis were
impounded in the Auckland Park region and on Jan Smuts Avenue. The incident occurred on Wednesday on Kingsway Avenue in Auckland
Park. A Sunman was in the taxi when the taxi driver saw the road
block ahead of him. The driver wasted no time in executing a sharp U-turn on
Annet Road into Barry Hertzog Avenue. However, he didn’t realize that the cops were on his tail. As he turned into Stanley Avenue, a JMPD officer was right
behind him, and his taxi was impounded, along with two others. “The reason we’re
doing operation Buya Mthetho is to let motorists to comply with road traffic
road regulations, stop skipping red lights, stop driving over directional
arrows, stop motorists from overtaking on the wrong side of the road, stop
motorists from using the emergency lanes, so that commuters can be safe, and so
that these unroadworthy vehicles are taken off the road,” Minaar said.
