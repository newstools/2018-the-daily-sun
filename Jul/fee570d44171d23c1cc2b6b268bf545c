THE Tyhalani family from Mesiya squatter camp in Cape Town lost five kids in a shack fire last month. After Daily Sun published their sad story, the family got help but they still needed more. Margaret Tyhalani (42) lost four kids. She said they were still struggling because they don’t have a proper place to live. “We are staying with my sister at Marikana squatter camp, but her shack is not big enough for us.” Her sister also lost her son, who was visiting Margaret’s place when the shack caught fire. Margaret said she was also battling to send her daughter, Nangamso (19), to university. Nangamso is a second-year nursing student at the University of Western Cape. “I often used part of the kids’ grant money for my daughter’s transport to university. I also ran a small business but now that the kids are no more, I’m battling to send Nangamso to university,” said Margaret. She said she would appreciate any help so that her daughter could go back to university. Nangamso said: “I trust God and I know He will make a way for me and my family.” Thulani Stemela, a DA PR councillor, visited the family on Tuesday. He donated food parcels to Margaret and her daughter. Stemela said he wouldn’t have known about the family if Daily Sun hadn’t published the story. “I wanted to help as soon as I read their story, but I couldn’t because they were still in the Eastern Cape. “But I waited for the family to come back and still contributed,” said Stemela. Margaret thanked Stemela for the food parcels. “I didn’t know people were still thinking about us. We will forever be grateful to Daily Sun for speaking to people who came through for us in our time of need. I have a place in Mesiya, but I don’t want to live there anymore because it reminds me of my dead kids.”
