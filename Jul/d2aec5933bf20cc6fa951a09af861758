BARELY a year after joining controversial record label Ambitiouz Entertainment, Priddy Ugly has confirmed he’s leaving. The rapper, whose real name is Ricardo Moloi, joins a long list of artists including Amanda Zulu, Fifi Cooper, A-Reece and BenchMarq who’ve parted ways with the label. Speaking about his exit, he said: “I signed with Ambitiouz last year and left a month ago. “I want to push and release music on my own. I did a lot on my own.” Although a number of other musicians left the label in unpleasant circumstances, Priddy Ugly said he made a clean exit. “My situation is very different. We didn’t fight and they support me,” he said. “All the money I made was my own. Everything I recorded belongs to me. I shot music videos by myself.” He said he was happy being an independent artist and didn’t have any plans to sign with another label yet. “I’ve been approached by a few labels and managers, but I’m not looking for any label. I don’t see myself signing with any record label yet.” Asked about his contract with Ambitiouz, he said it was a straightforward contract but didn’t give details. The rapper, who’s dating fellow entertainer Bontle Modiselle, said he plans to release an album next month. It will be a deluxe version of E.G.Y.P.T, which he recorded while still at Ambitiouz. He said it would feature new songs and remixes of old ones, and he was planning a world tour in September. Ambitiouz Entertainment kept hanging up when the SunTeam called for a comment.
