Local actor MacDonald Ndou, best known for portraying the role of the arrogant and scheming shiny suit wearing KK on Muvhango, is officially off the market. The star reportedly tied the knot in a private ceremony a few weeks ago. Ndou, who fiercely guards his privacy away from screen, was able to keep the wedding under wraps until one of his friends who attended the ceremony spilled the beans. The photos of Ndou and his beautiful partner surfaced on social media on Tuesday. In contrast to his on screen character, Ndou looked rather stylish in his purple suit as his real life personality shone through. Check out the pictures below: Congratulations to one person whom I’ve grown to know and call a friend -MacDonald Ndou. I hope the good Lord blesses your union with many more years of hapiness and growth.. May this chapter you’ve tapped into be your physical manifestation of your blessings.
