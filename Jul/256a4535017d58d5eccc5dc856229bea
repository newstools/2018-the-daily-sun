SINGER Cici was cleared yesterday on charges of assaulting ex-boyfriend and record label boss Arthur Mafokate. Magistrate Lieland Poonsamy found the Run Away hit maker, whose real name is Sindisiwe Thwala, not guilty. As Cici left the stand in the Midrand courtroom, she cried and her mum Thandi hugged her. This was after the magistrate had found there were inconsistencies in Arthur’s testimony. Some of the things which he claimed had happened while testifying in court were apparently not in his police statement. Poonsamy said Arthur’s claims that he had suffered open wounds could not be supported by findings of the doctor who had examined him. “Even a child would know the difference between a bump, open wound and a swelling,” said Poonsamy. The 999 record label boss had claimed that Cici, in an apparent jealous rage, had hit him with a chair and tried to grab his cellphone. Cici, who pleaded not guilty, had insisted that she only wanted the phone to call an Uber taxi after ending their relationship. Arthur is expected to appear in the same court to face an assault charge laid by Cici. Meanwhile, Themba Masango of the #NotInMyName organisation told the People’s Paper: “We feel vindicated because she has been found not guilty.” Masango said Arthur, in his opinion, was lying with regard to what happened on the day on which the couple fought. Cici refused to comment.
