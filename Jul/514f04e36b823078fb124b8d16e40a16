Afro Pop singer, Lungisa Xhamela has announced some pretty big changes to the direction of his musical career. The soulful singer, who has come a long way since having his Idols SA dream crushed twice, is now aligning his brand with big names in the music industry. Not only has he partnered with Universal Music Publishing, but has also entered into a worldwide publishing deal with Vth Season management who are responsible for AKA’s big break in music. All of this seems to be happening at the right time for him as he is about to release some new music next month. “Lungisa has a voice like heaven and song-writing skills to boot. We’re sure he is going to blow up in a big way! His style will capture South African audiences in that it sounds like home but has elements from the club. South Africans are about to fall in-love with this guy,” said Ryan Hill, MD of Universal Music Publishing SA. Lungisa’s career seems to be on the upward trajectory these days and his names just seems to be on everybody’s lips. He recently released an “outcoustic” (outdoor) performance of his latest single Think About It. He was also given the opportunity to pay homage to late icon, Nelson Mandela this past Wednesday on Afro Café as the show put together a special centenary episode.
