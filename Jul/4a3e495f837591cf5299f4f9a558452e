BUSINESSMAN Samson Makhubela travels on his bicycle when selling meat to residents. But on Saturday, the 44-year-old from Phomolong in Modimolle, Limpopo, was allegedly robbed by young girls on their way from initiation school. Samson was on his way to meet a loyal customer. He claimed a group of more than 10 initiates whipped him senseless. And they took the R600 cash he’d collected from customers, as well as meat worth R700. “They took my money and meat. They even broke my bicycle,” Samson told Daily Sun. “All I want is my money back. They must also pay me for the meat.” He said the initiates targeted him because they’d often seen him travelling on that road. “There were other people walking past but they didn’t attack them,” he said. “I tried to fight back but they overpowered me. “Some held my hands tight while the others were whipping me. I still feel pain in my body.” Samson said being attacked by women initiates was a sign of bad luck. “How can young girls attack a man in broad daylight?” he said. “This is bad luck. I’m worried I’ll end up getting beaten by every woman I fall in love with.” Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Samson should lay a charge at the local cop shop. “Police will only investigate once a case has been opened,” he said. The SunTeam tried to get comment from people who run the initiation school. But the security guard wouldn’t let anyone in.
