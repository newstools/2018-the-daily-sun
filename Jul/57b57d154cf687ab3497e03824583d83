FEW PEOPLE have had as many movies and documentaries made or books written about their lives as our first democratic president. Nelson Mandela, fondly known by his clan name of Madiba, who once was seen as a terrorist, rose to become the father of the nation and one of the world’s most respected statesmen. Large sums have been spent documenting his life and even after his death, books are still being published about him. Unfortunately for us, Madiba has mostly been portrayed in movies by American or British actors. In 1987, Danny Glover acted as Madiba in prison in the TV movie Mandela, which earned him an Emmy award.  Ten years later, Sidney Poitier played him in Mandela and De Klerk opposite British star Michael Caine as former president FW de Klerk. Dennis Haysbert followed in 2007 with the story of Mandela’s life on Robben Island in the film Goodbye Bafana, focusing on a racist warder who changes his attitude and life while dealing with Mandela. In 2009, Clarke Peters starred as Madiba in the mini series Endgame. That year, Morgan Freeman also portrayed our former president in the inspiring drama Invictus, about how Mandela brought the country together through the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Freeman won an Oscar for his part. The most recent Madiba film was shot in 2013, the last year he was alive. Starring British actor Idris Elba, the film was based on Mandela’s famous autobiography Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. UK actress Naomie Harris acted as his wife Winnie.  South African actors who have played Mandela include Lindani Nkosi in Drum (2004) and Simon Sabela in The Rivonia Trial. In 2016, Tumisho Masha became Mzansi’s first actor to be cast as Mandela in an international film in Mandela’s Gun.
