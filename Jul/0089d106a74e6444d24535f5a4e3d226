TV personality Jessica Nkosi is about to be a mother for the first time and she could not be more excited. The Isibaya star, who is very guarded when it comes to her private life, put an end to weeks of speculation last month when she confirmed through an Instagram post that she was indeed expecting her first child. After taking a break from the spotlight in the early stages of her pregnancy, Jessica has since become more open about it, even proudly flaunting her baby bump on a magazine cover. This weekend, the 28 year-old celebrated her baby shower which was attended by her family and friends, among them Ntando Duma and Ayanda Thabethe. She took to social media to share some of the pictures. "Ommmmwww I have no word to express how grateful and honored I m right now, my daughter is so blessed," she captioned one of the pictures.
