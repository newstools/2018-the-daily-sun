A 32-YEAR-OLD ATM card thief was sentenced to eight years in prison. Sikelela Bhanya was found guilty on two counts of fraud in the Elliotdale Regional Court on Friday. He was arrested in 2016. Sikelela targeted elderly people withdrawing money at ATMs.  He would pretend to help them but instead steal their cards from the machine. His luck ran out when he was cornered by angry Elliotdale residents while trying to steal madala Pati Sunduza’s money. He was assaulted but managed to escape and ran into a court building. He was rescued by police. The suspect was found in possession of several bank cash cards including that of Pati, and another one belonging to 60-year-old NoAmen Nyamakhulu. NoAmen had fallen prey to the fraudster a day before his arrest in Cofimvaba. She told the court she lost R2 500, which was withdrawn from her account minutes after she had been assisted by a man she positively identified as Sikelela. The NPA welcomed the sentence. Regional spokesman Luxolo Tyali told Daily Sun: “We welcome the sentence with the hope that it will serve as a deterrent to others.” Mthatha cluster police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said: “We’re relieved that someone was successfully convicted.”
