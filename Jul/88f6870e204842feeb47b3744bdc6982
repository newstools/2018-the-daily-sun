FORMER Kaizer Chiefs midfielder David “DVD” Mathebula has called it quits after an illustrious career spanning 16 years. The last club he played for was National First Division side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila. The 35-year-old has been appointed as assistant coach to Sello Chokoe at Tshakhuma. “We sat down with club management and decided that it would be best for me to join the technical team,” said Mathebula at the inaugural Limpopo Soccer Legacy Spectacular at the weekend. “It has always been my plan to become a coach when I retired. Thank God and Tshakhuma president Masala Mulaudzi for giving me this opportunity to learn. “It will be good to learn the ropes under Chokoe. I played under him last season and we know each other very well.” The Limpopo-born player kicked off his playing career at Giyani-based outfit Dynamos in 2002 before moving to Kaizer Chiefs in 2004, where he remained until 2011. While at Amakhosi, Mathebula won the 2004-05 Absa Premiership title, lifted the MTN8 trophy in 2006 and 2008, as well as winning the Telkom Knockout cup in 2007, 2009 and 2010. The player, who was a fan favourite back then, also has the 2006 Nedbank Cup medal in his cabinet. Realising that he was struggling for game-time, Chiefs loaned him out to now defunct Mpumalanga Black Aces in 2011 before brief stints at Moroka Swallows and SuperSport United. “I enjoyed playing football,” he said. “But I still feel I did not reach my full potential. “I feel I was not given enough time, as I was used as a substitute by most of the teams. The only place I fully enjoyed playing was at Swallows.”
