TRAIN commuters are not happy with Metrorail. Daily Sun spoke to on Wednesday said some trains were without heaters and windows in this frosty winter. Paulos Manaka (51) said he boards the train at Saulsville Station, Tshwane at 5am every morning to get to work in Silverton. “I’m not happy with the service we get from Metrorail. We buy tickets and they make us travel on trains that don’t have windows or heaters,” he said. Paulos often got home from work at 7pm because of delays. He said he’s been using the train for 24 years! Elizabeth Mokoena, who’s been travelling from Mamelodi to Pretoria Train Station for 15 years, said it was so cold in the trains it didn’t make any difference whether she dressed warmly. Another commuters said although Metrorail had bought new trains, these only operated from 9am to 3pm when many people were at work. Gauteng Metrorail spokeswoman Lillian Mofokeng said the problem was caused by vandalism in Mamelodi in March. “Windows were stolen and vandalised by commuters. The more often we fix them, the more they’re vandalised,” she said.
