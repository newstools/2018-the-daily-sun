WHEN sangoma Thozama Herdman (51) ignored her calling, it caused her years of pain. So when another sangoma told her that her 14-year-old daughter also had the calling, she knew she had to do the right thing. She brought her daughter along and the sangoma asked to observe her for a further three days, to which the mum agreed. But now Thozama is furious after the gobela performed ceremonies to start her daughter’s thwasa training without her consent and allegedly mistreated the young girl before chasing her away. Thozama of Protea Glen in Soweto told Daily Sun she had been consulting with the sangoma from Orange Farm, south of Joburg, to sort out her own life. But the sangoma suggested she bring her child. “I knew my daughter had a calling but wanted her to finish school first.” Thozama said she explained to the gobela she had no money to pay for her daughter’s training, but the gobela insisted the ancestors would provide. “I bought my daughter all the things she needed. When I was around she treated her well. I’d sometimes sleep over, but when I left she mistreated her.” The girl told the SunTeam her gobela would often deprive her of food. “She treated me badly, but I was willing to stick it out knowing I wouldn’t ever have to go back there,” she said. “The last time she beat me, she kicked me in my face and I had a blue eye. She confiscated all my belongings.” When the SunTeam called the gobela, her cellphone rang unanswered. Mtimande Ngwenya, of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Rights of Cultural Communities, said they were investigating the matter.
