YVONNE Mfana from Boitekong near Rustenburg, North West bought land from the Rustenburg Municipality in 2016. The land that she is yet to build on in Safari Gardens, near Waterfall Mall has large rocks and trees on it. There’s no house, water pipes or electrical installation but she already owes the municipality more than R18 000! Yvonne told Daily Sun she was slapped with a bill in February and ordered to settle the debt by April. “I have not slept since I got that shocking bill. I don’t understand why I should pay for services I don’t have. “I need answers from the municipality but they’ve been sending me from pillar to post. I have not built in that place but I owe so much money. How much will it be when I start building and living there?” she asked. Two other land owners, Mamela Mpangeva and Wendy Shiba, claim they are facing the same problem. Mamela apparently owes the municipality R29 000 and Wendy owes R36 000. Municipal spokesman Andrew Seome said the matter has been referred to the relevant department for investigation. He said the three women should visit the municipality for clarity.
