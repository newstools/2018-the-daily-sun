THE KZN ANC’s elective conference, which was scheduled for this weekend, might be cancelled again. In a statement issued on Friday, provincial task team coordinator Sihle Zikalala said the structure reached an out-of-court settlement with the branches that stopped the 8 June conference. Zikalala has set Thursday to Saturday as the new date for the long-awaited provincial conference, which is expected to elect a new leadership. But one of the applicants told Daily Sun that there was no such deal. The leader, whose name appeared on the six applications that went to the Pietermaritzburg High Court last month to stop the conference, said they had rejected the task team’s proposal to withdraw the case. He said the task team’s lawyers met the applicant’s legal advisers on Thursday when the out-of- court deal was discussed. However, no agreement was reached. “It did not make sense to us. How do we allow illegitimate branches to participate in the conference then disband them and elect new ones later?” he said. According to a memo sent to task team members by Zikalala on Friday, the conference, which was scheduled for this past weekend, was delayed by court processes. The memo was followed by a media statement in which Zikalala announced the new date as Friday and Saturday. When Daily Sun asked task team member Supa Zuma about the confusion, he said Zikalala would provide clarity during today’s structure meeting.
