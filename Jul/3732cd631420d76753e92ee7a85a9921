BERNARD MOLEKWA is not bitter about losing his job as Polokwane City FC head coach. The Limpopo-based side appointed a new mentor from Slovakia Jozef Vukusic. And Molekwa was demoted to be his deputy on Thursday. But the 41-year-old Limpopo-born mentor, who has been with Rise and Shine for two seasons, told SunSport he was ready to work with the former National First Division FC Cape Town head coach, who is 13 years older than him. “I respect the club’s decision to appoint a new coach and I’m ready to work with him and learn from him,” said Molekwa. “I’m thankful to chairman Johnny Mogaladi for the opportunity he gave me to coach in the Absa Premiership and for believing in me. “I’m still young and still want to learn from other experienced coaches. Working with Josef is another chance for me to learn.” He added: “To be honest, what makes me happier is that I’m still with Polokwane City and I love it here.” In his two seasons in charge of City after succeeding Luc Eymael, Molekwa guided City to finish in an impressive 6th spot in the 2016/17 season as an interim coach. He impressed Mogaladi, who made him the head coach last season. But things didn’t go well as the team struggled and had to fight to survive relegation in their last league match. City finished the season at 12 spot after 16 draws, 8 loses and six wins. And an unhappy Mogaladi admitted that his club had a bad season and change was needed, so that they could be a better side next season. “We didn’t play well last season. We went and check what happened,” said Mogaladi, who identified Vukusic as the remedy to fix the problem in the coming season which starts on the 4 August with a clash against their Limpopo rivals Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium. Meanwhile, City have also released the likes of Rendani Ndou, Thabiso Semenya, Donald Makondelela, Lorence Vilakazi, Tsepo Tema, Rendy Ngobe and Nazier Jacobs.
