PASTOR STHEMBISO Zondo, the man with the famous 4-5, is back! The popular pastor was taken off air after a video of him seen naked went viral. BUT NOW HE IS BACK ON AIR, STANDING AS TALL AS EVER! Yesterday morning there was huge excitement among Ukhozi FM listeners when they heard his voice on Dudu Khoza’s weekday show, Jabul’ujule. The pastor was taken off air in January 2015 when a video was leaked of him showing his 4-5 while talking on the phone and sitting with his lover. Many of his followers took to social media to praise Ukhozi FM for bringing him back. Referring to the incident that got him fired in the first place, Zondo said: “Tigers don’t cry.” During his live motivational talk, Pastor Zondo, the leader of the Soul Renaissance Ministries in Durban, said that he had forgiven the person who leaked the video. “When that video was first sent to me, I spent 13 days praying and fasting,” he said. “The people who sent it to me said they were destroying me. They said I would never be invited to do motivational talks in the country again.” He said he was left shattered and hurt that the person that he thought was his lover could do something like that. “That is when I decided to tell her to go on with what she had planned. The most dangerous people in the world are those who hug and laugh with you. When the devil wants to destroy you, he uses those people who are close to you,” he said. Speaking to Daily Sun about his on-air return, he said: “I have been offered a show to motivate men since it is men’s month. I can’t say whether they will keep me for good but for now allow me to enjoy being back on air and speaking to my people. “I owe South Africans a big thank you for accepting me back with open arms. God is good all the time.” When called for comment SABC spokesperson, Kaizer Kganyago said: “The station has no contract with him in place but he is being used as and when necessary by the station.”
