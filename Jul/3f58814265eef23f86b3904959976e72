Police minister Bheki Cele on Thursday revealed that Errol
Present has been linked to other heists. Cele revealed this during a press conference in Cape Town. Errol Present and 3 others were arrested earlier this week
in connection with a cash-in-transit heist in Dobsonville, Soweto. The suspects appeared in court on Wednesday, and the case
was postponed to 31 July. Cele also said that Present is linked to other crimes that
he allegedly committed in the past. “"The arrest of Errol Velile Present is the arrest of just
another criminal,” he said. “What we have established is that Velile is linked to
another cash heist before this, other cases and drunken driving."
