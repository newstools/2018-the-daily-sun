IT was tears of joy on the face of Irene Baloyi and her
three children on Mandela Day. The Vhembe district Municipality Executive Mayor Florence
Randzilani and Mayor of Collins Chavani Municipality Joyce Bila together with
the Limpopo SABC branch, handed over a five roomed house in Nwamatatani village
as part of Madela day celebration. Speaking at the handover Randzilani said the municipality
and other stakeholders decided to make a difference in the Baloyi family. She said is the duty of every citizen to change the life of someone,
because every day is a Mandela Day. Munghana Lonene FM’s Vongi Khanyani said the station is
committed to change the life of other people for the better. She said they knew of the Baloyi falimy’s struggles and they
have a good relationship with all local municipalities and they aim to help
those who are in need. Irene Baloyi said she is grateful to the municipality and
what they did to her and her children. "We used to camp in a one room house and now God made a
miracle, by sending angels to assist  me
with the decent house," Baloyi said. The house has a dining room, a lounge, stove and two bed
rooms .
