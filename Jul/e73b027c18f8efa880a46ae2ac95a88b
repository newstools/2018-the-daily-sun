A WOMAN whose husband was poking other women decided to
take drastic action to put an end to his cheating ways. According to Daily
Mail, on Monday Karuna Sanusan (24) executed her plan while her husband Siripan
(40) lay sleeping in their house in Sriracha near Bangkok, Thailand. She later told the cops: “Me and my husband work together
selling organic vegetables at a stall. Before this happened I became suspicious
he was having an affair. I always saw him flirting with a lot of girls and I
had an idea of what he was doing. “Then I found out that he was secretly going with other
women. This made me very angry. I was full of anger and couldn't relax. I was
so angry inside. “I planned to do this. I aroused him in the morning while
he was absent-minded, then used the knife to cut off his penis. I threw it out
of the window.” Neighbours heard Siripan’s howls of agony and called the
cops, who rushed him to Samitivej Sriracha Hospital nearby. They eventually
found his 4-5 outside, but their efforts to store it in ice so surgeons could
sew it back on his body failed. Cop Somkid Boonlert said: “Police arrived along with
rescue staff and found the man severely injured. “The man had lost a lot of blood. He is now under close
medical supervision. He will never be able to use his penis in the same way
again. Doctors said the cells in the penis are dead as it had been out of his
body for too long. He will be disabled for the rest of his life.” Karuna has been arrested and is being held in custody.
