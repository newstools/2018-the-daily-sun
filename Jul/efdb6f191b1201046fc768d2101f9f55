A man claiming to be a Gauteng cop was arrested for speeding in Mokopane, Limpopo, on Sunday. The 33-year-old was caught clocking 107km/h in a 60km/h zone. The suspect allegedly ignored traffic cops who tried to stop him and almost knocked down one of them. He was driving a white VW Polo. Adriana Matsemela, the mayor of Mogalakwena Municipality, condemned the man’s bad driving. She said after the suspect ignored traffic cops’ instructions, a chase ensued and cops only managed to stop him in Mookgophong, 52km away from the scene. The suspect was arrested and taken to Mokopane cop shop, where cases of exceeding the speed limit of 60km/h, reckless driving, and failure to stop on the instructions of a traffic cop were opened. The suspect was expected to appear in the Mokopane Magistrates Court. Matsemela said reckless driving and speeding were major causes of fatal crashes on the roads. “Our traffic cops and other law enforcement agencies will continue to deal decisively with those who don’t adhere to road rules,” the mayor told Daily Sun. He was driving a Toyota Hilux bakkie at a speed of 162km/h! He was then arrested and detained at Westenburg Police Station. He was expected to appear in the Polokwane Magistrates Court.
