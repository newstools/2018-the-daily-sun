HE HAD a nyatsi his wife knew nothing about. But on Sunday the affair became public knowledge. The 47-year-old man’s nyatsi allegedly stabbed him to death with a broken mirror. The man, who lived with his wife in Bloemfontein, died in Rouxville. “The man was away for the weekend to bury his cousin when the tragedy happened,” said a source. “The nyatsi, with whom he had a child, came to collect papgeld. “She was unhappy with the money she received from him and a fight broke out. “The man pushed her away from his front door and tried to close it. “But she picked up a piece of broken mirror and stabbed him in the neck. “He died on the scene while the nyatsi waited for cops,” said the source. “She kept saying she wouldn’t accept R100 papgeld.” Daily Sun visited the man’s wife, but she refused to speak to the SunTeam. Police spokesman Sergeant Yanga Ngcukana confirmed that the 31-year-old nyatsi was arrested. He said paramedics certified the man dead at the scene. “It’s alleged the dead man phoned the suspect and summoned her to come and collect money for the child,” said Ngcukana. A fight apparently broke out and the man sustained a fatal stab wound. “The murder weapon was confiscated and the suspect was arrested,” said Ngcukana. The suspect appeared in the Rouxville Magistrates Court yesterday on a murder charge. The woman was granted R500 bail. “She’s expected to make another appearance on 21 August.”
