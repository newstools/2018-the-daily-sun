HEALTH Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said yesterday that a decision not to allow his department to introduce HIV counselling and testing in schools put the country in a bad place. When it wanted to start a programme about five social issues faced in schools, parents, unions and other stakeholders agreed to only three. “They said we will teach the kids what they don’t know, but these kids know a lot,” he said.   He appealed to parents to allow the department to teach teens about health. Motsoaledi was speaking at the launch of the Human Sciences Research Council’s HIV Prevalence, Incidence, Behaviour and Communication survey in Tshwane. The HSRC survey found the HIV incidence rate was generally higher among women aged between 15 and 24. It found the number of new infections was three times that of men. The number of new infections declined significantly last year compared with 2012, to 230 000. More than 33 000 people were interviewed and almost 24 000 agreed to HIV testing. The study found more than 60%, or 4,4 million, people living with HIV/Aids were on ARVs.  It also found the provinces with the highest HIV prevalence were KZN, Free State and Eastern Cape.
