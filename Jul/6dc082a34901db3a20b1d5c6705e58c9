The 18th of July is known as Mandela Day and this year, this day would have marked the 100th birthday of former president Nelson Mandela. Former US president Barack Obama delivered the Nelson Mandela lecture yesterday which was attended by thousands of people, including local celebrities. In honour of the late great Madiba, some celebrities have joined the rest of the country in taking 67 minutes out of their busy schedules to make a difference in society. Cast members of popular SABC 1 soaps Generations: The Legacy and Uzalo, spent their 67 minutes painting a primary school and a children’s home respectfully. The cast and crew of popular SABC 2 soap Muvhango spent their 67 minutes at the Soweto Old Age home.
