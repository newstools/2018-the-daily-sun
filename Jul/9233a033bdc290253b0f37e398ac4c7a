THE Maimane Alfred Phiri Games will have new champions this year. But it will be difficult for punters to decide which team to bet on to take home the R175 000 in prize money following the early elimination of Ndengeza FC, defending champions and favourites to win after dominating the games in the past. Football fans have been stunned by everything that has happened at the Fifa World Cup in Russia, where we have witnessed so-called top dogs such as Spain, Portugal and Germany get knocked out of the competition early on. The same has transpired at the 2018 MAP Games currently underway at Alexandra’s Rotary Grounds. Since the tournament was founded in 2001 no team has been able to defend the title and the trend continues this year. The Round of 16 will take centre stage this weekend without the likes of Black Poison, Ndengeza, Rebels and Ama 10-10 – who have all been strong at this event in the past, reaching the top four on several occasions. Founder of the games Maimane Phiri said people should expect more surprises as the tournament continues. “A lot has happened – some of the top teams got eliminated early in the tournament – but there’s no doubt that the remaining teams also still have a lot to offer,” said Phiri. “No team has defended the title yet –it proves the competition is strong and it is not as easy as it looks.” Four Last 16 games will take place at the Rotary Grounds from 9am-5pm on Saturday. Moretele All Stars, who eliminated reigning champions Ndengeza 5-3 on penalties, will also be in action as they face JT Black Stars. In other games on the day, ComeBoys will lock horns with Skomboys, while La Macia will clash with the Rock. The action continues on Sunday with four more games at the same venue, featuring Baroka, Mamba XI, Juventus and Newcastle Homeboys.
