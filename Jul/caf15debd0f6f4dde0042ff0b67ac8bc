THE Westenburg protests were taken to a new level when residents set two police vans on fire on Tuesday night. The suspects who burnt the vehicles allegedly got into the police station at Westenburg outside Polokwane, Limpopo by cutting the fence. They threw flaming objects and set a police van and a truck alight before running away. This came after eight protesters from Westenburg, outside Polokwane, Limpopo were arrested during a violent protest that resumed on Tuesday. Yesterday residents barricaded main roads to Polokwane with burning tyres while more police were sent to the township. Residents said they were being ignored by the municipality in terms of service delivery. Community leader Ray Gulkan said they had compiled a memorandum of grievances that they wanted to hand to the mayor. “Our recreation facilities are in disrepair, we have no clinic and we want local businesses to get first preference for construction jobs.” Polokwane municipal spokesman Tshidiso Mothapo said people were previously given a chance to speak to the mayor about service delivery. “Projects like clinics don’t fall under the municipality,” Mothapo said. “We will respond to their grievances.” Limpopo police commissioner General Nneke Ledwaba said: “We have opened additional cases of malicious damage to property, including public violence. The eight arrested people aged between 29 and 56 will face various charges when they appear in the Polokwane Magistrates Court.
