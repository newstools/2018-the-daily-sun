FOR the past two months, Harding in the south of KwaZulu-Natal has been in the spotlight. The town made the news again on Wednesday when cops found a massive drug lab on a farm and bust two suspects. Police Minister Bheki Cele, national commissioner General Khehla Sitole and Hawks boss Godfrey Lebeya visited the area yesterday. Cele said the bust was the biggest they have seen in the country. “It was found that the farm, purchased about two years ago, has been operating this lab for some time. It has been a growing business as there are two machines, which cost millions.” He said they are looking for the farm owner as the two people who were bust said they were employees. They found that the drugs produced on the farm were transported to Durban, Joburg and Cape Town. “We are going to dig more to find out if the drugs were being transported outside the country, because the massive material found at the farm shows the business was big,” he said. Cele said the owner, who is still at large, recently bought another farm in Howick. “We believe he was going to expand his business on the new farm too,” he said. He said drug abuse is a serious problem and they will find all manufacturing factories and shut them down. The two suspects bust were charged with possession and dealing in drugs.
