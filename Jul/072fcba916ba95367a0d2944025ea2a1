WELKOM police are looking for four men in connection with a rape case. This comes after a 20-year-old woman was raped at her home in Riebeeckstad in Welkom, Free State three weeks ago. The attackers allegedly forced their way into her house while her husband was away. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said: “It is alleged that the four men were looking for her Zimbabwean husband. The suspects are still at large.” He said anyone with information should contact Detective-Warrant Officer David Smit on 057 391 6259 during office hours.
