CHURCH members have vowed to pray day and night for the return of items stolen from them. Members of the National Baptism Church in Mamelodi, Tshwane had to worship outside in the cold on Sunday as thugs broke their security gate on Saturday and stole 22 chairs, one bench and two toilet seats. According to residents, thieves have recently started targeting churches in the kasi. Worried church member Simon Khotlele (55), from extension 4, said thieves were not even ashamed to steal from the house of the Lord. “We are shocked about the incident as thieves have cost us a lot. This is the first time our church has been broken into,” he said. Pastor Lucky Kgonothi, who is based at the church’s branch in Atteridgeville but worshipped in Mamelodi on Sunday, said people didn’t understand that a church was a holy place where people were blessed. “As members of this church, we are not happy. I tried to talk the congregation out of taking the law into their own hands,” he said. “They are in the process of building a brick church and turning the zinc building they currently use into a storeroom. “We are now scared that when we start storing building materials, they will be stolen.” Kgonothi encouraged church members to continue praying for the church. He pleaded with the community to respect the church and told thieves to stop stealing from churches as they would be cursed. Mamelodi East police spokesman Captain Michael Mbewe confirmed that a case of burglary was opened. “Police are still investigating the matter,” he said.
