THE inter-ministerial committee for social security has launched legal action against officials from Cash Paymaster Services. According to the committee, the officials were interfering with the process of moving the payment of Sassa grants to the South African Post Office. They claimed CPS misinformed beneficiaries on the process agreed upon after a judgment by the Constitutional Court. The committee, led by Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, briefed the media in Tshwane yesterday to give a status update. Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane said great progress had been made. She said the gold card the Post Office had been giving to beneficiaries was safer than the old Sassa cards as it did not allow for illegal or fraudulent transactions to take place. “It’s designed to protect social grant beneficiaries from illegal deductions for things such as electricity, airtime and loans,” she said. “The only deductions permitted on the new gold card will be for funeral policies on non-child grants, which should not be more than 10% of the total grant.” She said the change to the new system was never meant to inconvenience grant recipients, adding that the system had been unable to deal with the huge volume of transactions they received as a result of increased uptake of card swaps.
