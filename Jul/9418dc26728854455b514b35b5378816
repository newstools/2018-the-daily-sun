AS A MEDICAL doctor, Tumisang Makweya (37), known by his fans as Dr Tumi, knows how to heal people physically. But his music heals the soul. Dr Tumi grew up in a Christian family. Both his parents are pastors of the Assemblies of God in Seshego, Limpopo. “The church was my first foundation. I have sung and played keyboard all my life. I only realised later that it was a music training institution,” he told Daily Sun. When he went on to study medicine at Medunsa he joined a student Christian fellowship. After graduation he worked for four years but started feeling empty inside. “I moved into private practice but nothing changed until I recorded my first album, Love and Grace and I felt fulfilled,” he said. “Medicine heals the body. Music speaks to the soul and spirit.” One of the testimonies from his fans was from a woman who said Nothing Without You saved her life. Dr Tumi said: “She told me that night was her last, but I saved her. My song touched her heart.” His first show at the Barnyard Theatre in Tshwane in 2015 was sold out and the album went gold, then platinum and then double platinum.” The follow-up album, Speak a Word, was recorded at the Gathering of Worshippers at the Ticketpro Dome in August and followed the same path. Dr Tumi is involved in social responsibility projects. He currently supports Refilwe Legae children’s home in Alexandra. He will soon launch the Dr Tumi Foundation through which he will help feed the needy. Next week, he’s releasing his new single called Wafika. “It is already trending on social media,” the gospel singer said. His followers can catch him at the Beauty for Ashes show which will be recorded live at the Voortrekker Monument in Tshwane on 1 September. “We’ll be exchanging sadness for joy there.”
