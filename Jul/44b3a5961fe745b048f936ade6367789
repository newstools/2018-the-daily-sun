MAMELODI Sundowns are teetering on the brink of Caf Champions League disaster! They are bottom of their Group C with two points from three matches after their shock 1-0 loss to AS Togo-Port in Lome yesterday. Pitso Mosimane’s charges now have to win all three their remaining matches to keep their destiny in their own hands. It remains to be seen whether they can pull off victory away to Wydad Casablanca and two more at home against Horoya and Port, whom they host next week. Judging by their performance against lowly Port yesterday, it may be difficult for the Tshwane giants to win away from home. Sundowns are still without a win in the tournament. And that is not good enough for a team usually better prepared for matches than Barack Obama is for a rousing speech. They were sunk by a solitary goal by Ayi Hunlede yesterday, who scored from a rare opportunity created by the hosts. Disaster struck for Downs minutes before the break as Ricardo Nascimento deflected the ball into the path of the approaching Hunlede, who drilled it home. Unlike the blunt Sundowns attackers, he made use of the opportunity – although his goal had an element of luck. Hlompho Kekana bounced a free kick off the wall while Oupa Manyisa reckoned he could score from an acute angle when he could rather have played a cross. Thokozani Sekotlong, unable to beat the keeper at close range, squandered Downs’ best chance shortly after the break. Sibusiso Vilakazi missed from a similar position in the 73th minute. Manyisa came close with a well-taken free kick while Tebogo Langerman crashed a shot against the crossbar.
