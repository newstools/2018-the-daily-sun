NEGATIVE thinking can have a devastating impact on all aspects of our lives. “These thoughts gain momentum when you think them over and over,” said Miss Plus Size Soweto finalist Kamogelo Mthembu. Kamogelo told SunBuzz she entered the pageant by chance. “My friend came across a poster calling for contestants to enter the pageant,” said Kamo. “She knew that I desperately wanted to be a beauty queen. “I submitted the required documents and I went for an audition. “I was one of the 14 young women who made the cut.” The 18-year-old from Protea North, Soweto, said growing up as a chubby kid was always difficult but her family encouraged her to look on the bright side of life. “I thought being fat was a bad thing and I wanted to lose weight so badly it made me cry,” she said. “But during my high school years I came to love my body.” Kamogelo said what kept her going was that she got positive comments from strangers telling her she had the perfect looks to become a top plus size model. “I become interested in fashion shows. “This is when I realised I had all the qualities to become a real beauty queen.” Organisers say the Plus Size Soweto pageant aims to get people to accept plus sized people and to stand up against body shaming. The finals of the competition will be held on 24 November. “Being chosen as a finalist boosted my confidence and self-esteem.” The finalists will be doing charity work on 4 August at Carl Sithole Orphanage in Soweto.
