HIGHLANDS PARK’s new signing Ivan Mokoena is aware of the huge challenges awaiting him in the Absa Premiership. The 23-year-old player was one of Highlands’ 12 new signings revealed by the club, together with the new sponsor for the upcoming 2018/19 campaign. Mokoena joined the Lions of the North from relegated National First Division (NFD) side Super Eagles. Mokoena made his mark during his first season in the NFD when he scored 13 goals to finish third in the scoring charts, just three goals away from winning the golden boot. That feat resulted in him winning a contract with the Lions of the North, who gained automatic promotion to the top flight. “I’ll have to be realistic. This is the PSL, and not the NFD. I was good last season, but no one knows me in the PSL. “I have a huge task up on my shoulders, to build my brand. And I’ll take it one step at a time. “This is the big league, I don’t want to put myself under pressure. I came here to learn from the best and improve as a player,” said Mokoena. In the past seasons we have seen players like Phumelele Bhengu, Cleopas Dube, Roggert Nyundu, Thabiso Kutumela and Sedwyn George banging in goals in the NFD, but struggled to get at least five in the elite league. Mokoena went on: “I haven’t set any targets regarding scoring goals yet. Firstly, I need to claim a spot in the match day squad, and then in the starting 11. “It will never be easy because in the PSL there’s also the Multichoice Diski Challenge, so if I don’t perform in the first team, I’ll find myself playing there and it will never be easy to claim a spot in the first team. “Listening to seniors and coaches will be key. It’s my first season, so I must learn from the Olympian (Mothobi Mvala), who was part of the SA Under-23 team in the 2016 Olympics.”
