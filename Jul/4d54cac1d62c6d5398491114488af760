AMBULANCES, fire trucks and bakery trucks can now reach Jeffsville without residents first having to lift overhanging electricity cables for them to pass. Daily Sun reported last Monday on how the worried community in Atteridgeville, west of Tshwane were struggling to get Tshwane Municipality to help them. But then SunPower kicked the municipality into action! After the article was published, residents again called the People’s Paper, this time to report their surprise to see municipal workers fixing overhead power lines and removing izinyoka cables. One of the residents, Frans Moyaha (41), said he immediately knew that officials had seen the article in the paper. He said they had complained for many months but after their story appeared in the People’s Paper, it took only two days for the cables to be fixed. “It is clear that had it not been for Daily Sun, the cables would still be hanging low, putting our kids’ lives in danger.” Frans said although they were happy that the cables had now been fixed, they were disappointed that it took Daily Sun to force the municipality to do its job. “Residents shouldn’t have to turn to the media to get help. Before elections, politicians come into our shacks with cameras and pose with us. They promise us heaven and earth but when they have our votes they say we are a danger to their workers.” He said now their kasi was safe again, thanks to Daily Sun. “Izinyoka wires have been removed. We have no words to thank Daily Sun.”
