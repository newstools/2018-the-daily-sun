A woman from west London was shocked, when she woke up to find a python in her bed. Itâ€™s alleged the python which is a pet, escaped and found its way next to her as she slept. Following that she contacted the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) for help on Monday morning. According to the Mirror in the United kingdom, by the time officers arrived at flat, the snake had slipped away. RSPCA officer said the flat owner jumped out of bed and closed their bedroom door to contain the snake but, when she arrived, the python was nowhere to be found. "I left my details and told them to contact me as soon as they saw it again." The python was finally caught by Ms Sanders in the corridor the following evening when she was called back to the flat.
