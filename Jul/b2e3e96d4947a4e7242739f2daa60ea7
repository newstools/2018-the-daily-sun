ONE of Nigeria’s bustling urban centres is offering
discrete services for horny women who have the cash to pay for male magoshas. A female Punch
journalist went undercover to confirm the rumours she heard of a carefully
hidden playground for rich and lonely women in Port Harcourt, a city in the
south of the country. The unnamed journalist and her female friend eventually
discovered the spot. Just inside its unremarkable exterior, the women
discovered a plush bar manned by about five hot, young, half-naked men. The women asked Patty, the manager on duty that night, how
they’d go about securing “a clean and neat guy” to keep them company. Patty told the reporter: “While others mainly supply
women for the satisfaction of men, we do the reverse. “Whichever specification of man you need to make you
happy in bed, we have one.” Gays and lesbians are apparently also catered for. Further information was given to Punch’s reporter by an
email apparently sent by the owner of the brothel, a woman who lives in the UK. “We offer very
sensual massages where you and the masseuse are completely naked in full
body-to-body oily or soapy massage. It can be at our spa or wherever you
desire. Two hours with happy ending with oily or soapy massage goes for N35 000
(about 1 290) and N40 000 (about R1 470) separately. “We have both male and female personnel, who are
medically screened periodically, well-trained and inducted, and from decent
backgrounds. We’re friendly, liberal and not judgmental at all. “Therefore, no matter your sexual orientation or secret
desires, you are very welcome. Just let us know how to please you better. The email promised that every effort was made to keep the
transaction secret, with guarantees that the magosha would not be carrying a
phone to avoid the potential for blackmail.
