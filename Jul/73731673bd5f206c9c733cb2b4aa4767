ELSIE Legoabe is a worried young woman. The 25-year-old from Onverwacht in Cullinan, Tshwane, claimed residents make her life miserable. Elsie said she was bust for arson in September last year after burning her former boyfriend’s shack. She said the guy was abusive. But ever since she was released from jail, her neighbours have been calling her names. She claimed a neighbour beat her in May after accusing her of theft. “I was angry when I burnt the shack I shared with my former boyfriend because he was abusing me. “I was arrested and spent three months awaiting trial at Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre. But people still judge me for my past,” she told Daily Sun. “I need help because I can’t live like this.” She said she had tried to commit suicide four times. “I want the community to forgive me for my past and accept me because I’ve suffered enough.” Elsie is a motivational speaker, choreographer and poet. She said her plans of using her skills to support herself and her mum were affected by the residents’ behaviour. Her mum, Maria Legoabe (56), said her daughter needed help. “Elsie can’t live like this. My daughter really needs help.” A resident said Elsie was a good person, but some people were still judging her because of her past. “It’s not fair on her. She paid for her sins and it’s time for residents to forgive her.” Mbangwa Xaba, a spokesman for Gauteng Social Development, told the People’s Paper: “The department will send social workers to assess Elsie’s situation and intervene if necessary.”
