THE National Heritage Council has started a programme in Cradock aimed at preserving struggle heroes’ memories. Members on Wednesday met with residents and families of revolutionaries who died fighting for freedom. The town is home to the Cradock Four – Matthew Goniwe, Fort Calata, Sparrow Mkhonto and Sicelo Mhlauli – who were murdered in 1985. A garden of remembrance was built years ago in their memory. But the multipurpose centre remains closed to the community. Council CEO Sonwabile Mancotywa said: “We wish to know the challenges these sites are experiencing. We’re also interested in recording successes that heritage practitioners have experienced in managing the sites.” The Cradock Four’s families, garden management and the board, the Cradock Council of Bishops, as well as Inxuba Yethemba and Chris Hani municipal officials met at the Vusubuntu Cultural Village Hall. The community agreed to host an annual lecture to celebrate the town’s liberation legacy.
