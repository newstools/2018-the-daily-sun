A young woman had the shock of her life when she got up
in the middle of the night thinking she needed the toilet, but instead gave
birth to surprise twins. Beth Bamford, 21, from Stoke-On-Trent, Staffordshire,
claims she had no idea she was pregnant because she was still having her
periods, and had attributed her weight gain to simply 'fat'. According to Daily Mail Beth from Stoke in England, who
is already mother of two kids gave birth to daughter Willow as her boyfriend
Andy Morris, 22, lay sound asleep just along the landing. Terrified, she called for an ambulance and emergency
services to take her through pushing out the afterbirth, but before they arrived
Willow's twin Freya popped out. Beth told the publication: 'It's a big shock but a nice
surprise. I didn't know I was pregnant at all. "I was in bed with my partner and I was getting pains. I
didn't say anything to him but I went downstairs to get a glass of water and
they got worse and I thought I needed the toilet. "I was still sitting on the toilet when I gave birth. I
didn't really have time to feel anything as it was happening. "t was a rush. One moment I was getting pain and the
next moment I have got two new babies. "I hadn't phoned an ambulance but I called the emergency
services and they talked me through it as I gave birth to the first one."
