THIS gogo is a SunHero. Not only did she save her one-year-old grandson from his boozing mum, she helped cops bust her. The gogo (64) found the little one alone in his mum’s shack after the mother allegedly poured booze in his feeding bottle. The shocking incident happened in Ogengele Village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, on Monday. The mum (28) allegedly gave her son alcohol because she wanted to go out with friends. The gogo said she received a call from her daughter’s neighbours, who told her to rush to the house. “The neighbour said my daughter had left the child alone in the shack,” said the gogo. “When I got there I found my grandson sleeping under the blanket.” “At first I thought he was dead, but when I came closer I could smell alcohol. I tried in vain to wake him up. “Worse still, his feeding bottle smelled of alcohol.  When I realised my daughter had fed her son alcohol, I called the cops to come and arrest her. “I didn’t even bother to call her because I knew she was boozing at a neighbour’s shack. I wanted the cops to find her there. “I then took the baby to my house and poured cold water over him.” The People’s Paper has learnt that cops found the mum in her neighbour’s shack, still boozing with friends. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane told Daily Sun the 28-year-old mum was arrested and is expected to appear in court soon.
