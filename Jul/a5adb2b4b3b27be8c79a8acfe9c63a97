WHEN research identified Khayelitsha as the biggest booze hot spot in Africa, Luvuyo Jongile was depressed at first. That’s because he thought kasi people had misplaced priorities. But then a bright idea hit him! Luvuyo (33) soon consoled himself by making his own gin, called Mayine, and it has taken the market by storm! “What motivated my business was a study conducted by the University of Stellenbosch. It said Hennessy Cognac reported that Khayelitsha was their best consumer spot on the continent. “To us it meant the township was an untapped market, but also that people’s priorities were twisted,” he said. Luvuyo and his wife Nodumo Jongile (29) spent a year researching gin and developing their own recipe. “We went to festivals, meeting people who were in the business already, soaking ourselves in it and it yielded this baby.” Jongile said it took 24 hours for the gin to be ready and that they produce about 200 bottles a week. “Within two to three years from now we hope to establish a plant in the middle of Khayelitsha, something that will create over 500 jobs,” he said. Jongile is a marketing manager and his wife is an auditor. They use their professional skills to improve their business. Mayine, which means “Let it rain”, is also the name of their son. Their product is already in some big shops in Mzansi. Luvuyo said they used their savings to start the business but that since then, big booze companies have come knocking on their door to work with them. “We are getting orders from outside Mzansi and the plan is to make the product an international brand.”
