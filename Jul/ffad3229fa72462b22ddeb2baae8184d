HUNDREDS
of South African children face different hardships and some go to school
barefoot. In
the spirit of doing good for the disadvantaged, many South Africans embraced Mandela
Day which takes place on 18 July. Mandela
Day is about changing the world for the better. Funeral
services provider, Doves Funerals has put a campaign in motion called the
#WalkwithDoves. The
campaign aims to supply underprivileged school children with shoes and socks,
during this cold winter weather. The Executive
Director and CEO of Doves Minki Rasenyalo, said the campaign is designed to
donate more than hundred school shoes. “It
is very cold to be walking barefoot to school, we are running this campaign and
are hoping that we will donate shoes and help the needy,” Rasenyalo said. She
said the company will donate the first hundred shoes and socks, the additional
shoes would be from anyone that would like to donate. “Personally,
I have a problem with my feet and I can imagine how they feel.” “I grew up in rural areas, I used to walk barefoot and I
know the effects. You cannot concentrate especially if your feet are extremely
cold,” added Rasenyalo.
