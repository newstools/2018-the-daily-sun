KING Goodwill Zwelithini told Zulus they mustn’t vote for parties that want to take the king’s land. “I want to warn you, my subjects, that these politicians will come for your vote but at the same time they are undermining you as a Zulu,” said the king. He was speaking at the imbizo at Ulundi Stadium, KZN yesterday. “These people are thieves who have stolen tax money and now they want to take our land. I urge you, my subjects, to stand up and be ready to defend your kingship and your land.” About 5 000 people attended the imbizo, including Minister of Police Bheki Cele, Premier Willies Mchunu and Arts and Culture MEC Bongi Sithole-Moloi. The king called the imbizo to announce plans to stop government from taking Ingonyama trust land, for which the king is the only trustee. He warned political leaders to stop behaving like God before the Zulu people. He said government was failing to stop protests in the country but would take land granted to traditional authorities. People given a chance to speak from the podium vowed to defend the kingship and the land under the king. “If this government takes our land we will do what we did to the British army at Isandlwana in 1879,” said one warrior. Judge Jerome Ngwenya, chairman of the Ingonyama Trust, urged people to tell the national parliamentary committee they want the land to remain under the king. The committee is touring provinces to hear people’s views on the bill to amend the constitution so that land may be taken without compensation.
