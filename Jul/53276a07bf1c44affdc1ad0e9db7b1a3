LITTLE Noluthando Masango’s family is pleading with whoever abducted her to bring her back home safely. The family from Siyabuswa, Mpumalanga is having sleepless nights since the six-year-old mysteriously disappeared on Saturday evening. Noluthando’s mum Thoko Masango (28) became ill and has been in and out of hospital because of stress. Gogo Leah Masango (55) said her granddaughter just disappeared without anyone noticing. Leah said the family was celebrating during the welcoming of initiates when Noluthando disappeared. She said her mum locked her in a room together with other kids but Noluthando was nowhere to be seen when all the kids were sent to bed. “Ever since my granddaughter disappeared, we are having sleepless nights and we cannot even eat. “Her mum is sick and cannot take it anymore. She has been in and out of hospital and has become frail. “We are pleading with whoever took her to bring her back home safely. “We were having a function for new initiates here at home and all the young kids were locked in one room. “One of them asked for a jacket as it was a bit cold and left the room. “We only noticed she wasn’t with the other kids when they were sent to bed. “None of them saw where my granddaughter went or who took her. “We looked everywhere, even at our neighbours and relatives but with no success,” she said. Leah told Daily Sun the little girl’s disappearance has badly affected everyone in the family and said they were pleading for her safe return. She said they wonder what she is wearing or eating, wherever she is. Police spokesman Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said they have opened a missing person’s file and are investigating.
