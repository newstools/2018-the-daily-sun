THREE student leaders at Nelson Mandela Bay University in Port Elizabeth face eviction from their residence off campus. They said they were being targeted for speaking up about the poor facility. Sihle Moya, Nambitha Klaas and a third student have been living at the Premier Student Accommodation in Korsten, a university private service provider paid for by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. Speaking on Monday, the students said they don’t have anywhere else to live. Sihle said: “There are 528 students who live at the complex. We were leading students complaining about the poor services. “There are only five stoves, one old microwave and a few fridges for all these students, as well as a single sink in the kitchen. “Our bath water is always cold. “We have to pay R50 for laundry while students at other residences don’t pay. “Wi-Fi service on the second and third floors is poor. “We held meetings with students about these issues. Then we received emails telling us we wouldn’t have places for the second semester.” Nambitha said the residence didn’t even meet minimum standards for student accommodation. The third student said he couldn’t perform his best because he was worried about accommodation issues. “We’ve been complaining about the condition of the residence since February. I just received another email today, telling me I should explain by Friday why my room should not be given to another student. “This is blackmail. I don’t know anyone in Port Elizabeth, so where will I live?” The deadline for the students to respond is Friday and an opportunity to present a response was set for Monday. University spokeswoman Zandile Mbabela said attempts to solve the situation would start once the current student holiday is over.
