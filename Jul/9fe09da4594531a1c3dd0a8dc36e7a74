STOP killing people with albinism! This was the message from various organisations that marched from Church Square to the Union Buildings in Tshwane on Saturday. Tshwantsho Tshabalala (37), who lives with albinism, said they wanted to address myths about people with the condition. “It’s wrong for people to say Aids can be cured if you sleep with a person living with albinism,” he said. Tshwantsho said their lives were in danger because people believed their body parts could be used for strong muthi to bring them luck. “We are targets in our communities and we don’t feel safe. We appeal to the government to protect us,” he said. Actress and albinism activist Bakwateleni Jiyane (35) said the killing of people with albinism must stop. “These people are like us and they have the same blood as us,” she said. Dewa Mavhinga, the Southern Africa director of Human Rights Watch, said they joined the march to support the rights of people living with albinism. ANC Youth League member Jane Khoza said they partnered with the #Albinismkillersmustfall initiative to fight the abuse of people living with albinism. Hannah Tshuma (9), who is also living with the condition, appealed to President Cyril Ramaphosa to do something radical to protect them. Shonisani Mudau from the president’s office received a memorandum and promised to respond within seven working days.
