MBONGELENI Mbhele died a terrible death, buried under a mountain of soil. And now the owner of the house where Mbongeleni and a colleague were digging a hole believes Mbongeleni’s spirit will haunt her family. Zonke Makhaya (53), a sangoma, wants Mbongeleni’s family to cleanse her house with a goat. She said the sewage pipe in her yard has been leaking for almost seven years. She said on Wednesday two men came to fix the pipe when she suddenly heard screams. “I ran out of the house and realised the voice was coming from the hole. I called out to other residents,” she said. “Residents managed to pull one of the men out but the other one was buried by soil.” They called the cops, who arrived and pulled the man out. But he was already dead. Mbongeleni’s mother Philisiwe (57) said they will cleanse Zonke’s house. KZN Traditional Healers Association chairman Thandonjani Hlongwane said: “It’s important that Zonke’s house is cleansed because the man’s spirit will cause problems for them.” Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed a case was opened at Ntuzuma cop shop.
