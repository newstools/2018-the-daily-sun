THESE parents were happy when they were blessed with a baby boy in 2003. But their joy turned to pain when their child started getting sick. Andries (39) and Matlakala (38) Zonzi from Hammanskraal, Tshwane, need help from SunReaders to help with their 16-year-old son, Keletso. He is living with a disability. Keletso can’t walk, sit, speak or feed himself. Andries told Daily Sun that his son was healthy when he was born, but things changed when he was three months old. “When we thought he was getting better, we noticed that he could not move on his own and his speech never developed as he got older,” said Andries. He said they took Keletso to several doctors, but they never knew what was wrong with him as they couldn’t afford a specialist. Andries said Keletso’s hip is infected because he sleeps on the right side, which is the only comfortable position for him. Matlakala was forced to quit her job so she could look after Keletso. She told the People’s Paper: “We would appreciate it if a Good Samaritan could helped our child with a wheelchair,” she said. A doctor said Keletso’s condition is known as neuromuscular disease, meaning his cells and nerves are not receiving messages from his brain. He said the condition was difficult to treat, especially as he was born with it. He advised the family to see a specialist.
