YET another fuel price increase will hit Mzansi next month! This was announced in Tshwane yesterday by Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane. Briefing the media on a cabinet meeting held on Wednesday, Mokonyane said government noted the recent fuel increases. She said world oil prices, linked to the American dollar, affected the cost of petrol, diesel and paraffin in South Africa. “Our currency’s exchange rate to the US dollar has fallen by over 1% since the beginning of May,” she said. “These currency changes, which result in price swings, have negatively affected consumers, particularly the poor.” Mokonyane said cabinet wanted to assure citizens that efforts were being made to lessen poor residents’ challenges. Treasury appointed a nine-member panel of experts to review the list of zero VAT rated items. She said the cabinet was also briefed on recent delays in paying social grants. “It understands social grants are a lifeline to the most vulnerable members of society and such inconvenience is regrettable. It expressed its sincere apology to all affected.” Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu told cabinet their problems were a result of the Post Office taking over payments and said most affected beneficiaries were paid this week. “Dedicated teams are working hard to stabilise the system to prevent such delays.” Mokonyane called on people to remember Madiba’s legacy, ahead of Nelson Mandela Day on 18 July.
