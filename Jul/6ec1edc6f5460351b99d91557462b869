ambulances can’t enter this kasi, taxis can’t drop off or pick up commuters, and  fresh air is a pipe dream. That’s because the main sewage line has been pumping kak onto the streets of Tshiame B kasi in Harrismith for the past year! A resident said: “We have a pool of sewage right on our doorsteps. “We’ve been complaining about this to our ward councillor and the municipal manager since last year. “But up to today nothing has been done. “We still live in the same filthy conditions.” What made things worse was that the municipality started a pavement project in another street. Meanwhile, they were still suffering. “The main sewer holes along the street were left open and kids could fall into them,” said the resident. “We can’t use our own cars and ambulances and hearses won’t be able to pass, either.” The residents literally breathed in their own kak on a daily basis. He said his daughter now suffered from a chronic disease caused by exposure to the kak. “Waste removal services are also unable to pick up waste as they can’t drive through, yet we pay rates and taxes.” Mpho Mabena, Maluti-A-Phofung water spokeswoman, told Daily Sun the line was 110mm in diameter, which was too small. “We experience blockages all the time and frequently unblock them.” The line had been identified as needing to be upgraded to 160mm in diameter. She appealed to residents not to throw all sorts of things in the system.
