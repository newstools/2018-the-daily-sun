ON SATURDAY,Western Cape ANC council leader Xolani Sotashe got his hands dirty when he visited his branch in Lwandle. Sotashe cleared a canal in Siyanyanzela informal settlement.  Plastic and old clothes have been blocking the canal since the recent heavy rain. The canal flooded the kasi because the rainwater was not draining away. Sotashe said they were not only cleaning the canal but were there to highlight the people’s troubles. “Our presence here is to demonstrate to the city of Cape Town that people are not supposed to live like this.” Sotashe said instead of the DA marching to the police station, they must take their municipality to clear the canal. “People cannot live like pigs. “We are here as the ANC to tell the municipality to pull up their socks,” he said. The municipality is clearing the blocked canals after residents protested about them earlier this month. Abongile Zazaza felt that by now the cleaning should have been finished. “Cape Town is one city for the rich and one city for the poor. “There is urgency when it comes to our issues as the poor and this needs to be highlighted,” Abongile said. Sotashe also said the cleaning is part of the Thuma Mina campaign in Western Cape, which is a call from President Cyril Ramaphosa to people to work together to improve the lives of all South Africans. About 200 volunteers joined Sotashe by taking part in the cleaning programme. He said the campaign is open to everyone. “Whether you are an ANC member or not, raise your hand and allow the president to send you. “We are calling for everyone to work together and heed his call.” Welcoming the programme, residents said they will try harder to keep their kasi clean.
