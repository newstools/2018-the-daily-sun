FOUR unknown suspects allegedly robbed worshippers at Ngwanamohube High School in Seleteng village outside Polokwane. The suspects ambushed two security officers who were on duty, at the school. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said they ambushed the two security officers and robbed them of their money, a gun and fifteen live rounds of ammunition. Following that, they forced the victims into the school building, where the congregants were worshiping and continued to rob them of their cell phones and blankets. “After they were done with their shady deeds, they handcuffed the officers, broke into one of the school offices and got away with eighteen laptops,” Ngoepe said. Ngoepe said in a related incident in the Matlala area, seven unknown armed suspects attacked security officers at Rapitsi High School in Ga-Phaudi village and disarmed them. "The suspects then handcuffed the guards and forced them to the main building where they broke into one of the offices, looted it and fled the scene," Ngoepe said. He said they stole a gun, seven live rounds, two cell phones, one pepper spray can. The Saps Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba urged community members to prioritise safety around schools at all times, by strengthening and supporting the already existing roll-out school safety programmes.
