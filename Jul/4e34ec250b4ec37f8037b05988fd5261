THE Automobile Association of South Africa (AA) says fuel
prices are expected to increase again at the end of July. The AA says unaudited mid-month fuel price data released by
the Central Energy Fund shows that International oil prices changed during the
first half of July, but remained within a fairly narrow band. It says the oil prices did not contribute substantially to
the price rises we are anticipating for next month. “The big news is again on the Rand front. The local currency
started this month with a deficit thanks to several days of losses against the
US dollar at the end of June. However, the Rand clawed back some of these losses during a
period of unusually flat trading in the first half of June,” the AA said in a
statement. According to the AA, current data suggests a price rise of
19 cents a litre for petrol, 13 cents for diesel, and 22 cents for illuminating
paraffin. “If the prevailing Rand and fuel price trends persist for
the rest of July, the fuel price increase may be lower than expected, but we
cannot rule out the possibility of further volatility.” The AA said the increases have brought the issue of fuel
costs firmly into the public domain. “We believe now is a good opportunity for the government to
revisit the issue of the fuel levies with a view to reducing them
significantly, especially as this is a cost it has control over.” If the petrol prices increases it will cost R16.21 a litre
inland, and R15.72 on the coast.
