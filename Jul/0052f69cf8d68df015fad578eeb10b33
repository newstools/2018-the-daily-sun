IT STARTED with rude shop assistants and he was later assaulted by security guards at the mall. Tsheko Maifadi (36) from Opperman in Hammanskraal, said the incident happened on Christmas Eve when he went to a shop to exchange his son’s shoes. He said the shop assistants were rude and he demanded to speak to the manager. Instead of calling the manager, the workers allegedly called security guards who beat him. “I called the cops and they took me to hospital,” said Tsheko. He said after being discharged from hospital, bad luck started following him. “I started getting angry easily and fighting with people. “I would often get sick and have to be absent from work. Tsheko said Daily Sun was his last hope. “I really need help. I will lose my job because I’m often in and out of hospital. I also want the guards who beat me to be arrested.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Margaret Molane said an assault case was opened, but no arrest was made.
