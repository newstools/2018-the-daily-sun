Depositors of the embattled VBS Mutual Bank made their way to
Nedbank branches at the crack of dawn in Thohoyandou. On Monday the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) governor,
Lesetja Kganyago, announced that over 20 000 depositors of VBS would receive
their monies as long as the money deposited to the bank did not exceed R100
000. One of the depositors Mashadu Mulelo said she did not
believe that she would receive her money. "I'm very happy that I finally got my money and itâ€™s up
to me where I want to invest my money," said Mashudu. Nedbank has also set mobile offices to help hundreds of
depositors in and around the Thohoyandou, Sibasa and Makhado areas. Another depositor Joseph Ndou said he was happy, about how Nedbank
is assisting them. When Daily Sun visited the VBS offices there was no single
client, but only staff members in the offices. VBS curator Anoosh Rooplal said the bank would have to
recover around R1.5bn for any hope that the bank could be saved.
