THREE teachers accused of tying a 14-year-old boy’s hands behind his back and beating him have resigned. Three months ago, the three teachers allegedly took the boy from his home to an empty classroom. The boy was accused of stealing a cellphone and, with his hands tied behind his back, the teachers took turns beating him on his buttocks. It happened at Makaula Senior Secondary School at Lugangeni Village in KwaBhaca, Eastern Cape. “I confessed to stealing the phone. After the beating I was sent back to class. I had to stand up because I couldn’t sit properly,” he said. The pupil was transferred to Natala Junior Secondary School in Mount Ayliff. “I’m happy at my new school and I’ve made new friends,” he said. The boy’s dad said: “I was disgusted when I heard three men beat my son. “He could not defend himself. We opened a case of assault. “The families of the three teachers came to our house many times and apologised. “The family discussed the matter and decided to withdraw the charges.” Mount Frere cops spokeswoman Captain Edith Mjoko said an assault case was opened but no one had been arrested yet. “I can’t confirm if the charges were dropped,” said Mjoko.
