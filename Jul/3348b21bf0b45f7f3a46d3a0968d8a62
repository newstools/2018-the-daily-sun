ORLANDO Pirates duo Thembinkosi Lorch and Thabo Qalinge could miss the opening fixture of the 2018-19 season against Highlands Park due to injuries. On Tuesday Pirates gave an injury update on their website and the duo could be out for few weeks due to injuries. The 26-year old Qalinge suffered a muscle abductor strain in a friendly match against National First Division side Stellenbosch FC in Cape Town at the weekend. According to the Bucs medical team, ‘Section’ as he is affectionately known, is still experiencing some discomfort and as a result he will continue working on his rehabilitation. Meanwhile, Lorch is also considered a doubtful starter against the Lions of the North as well. The 25-year old Lorch limped off the pitch in Pirates’ friendly match against Cape Town City, after sustaining a knock to the knee and has since been receiving treatment. PSL released the fixture for the upcoming season and Pirates will host PSL newbees Highlands Park in the first week of August at Orlando Stadium (8pm).
