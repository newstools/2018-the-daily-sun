ANDRIAMIRADO Andrianarimanana, popularly known in his home country of Madagascar as Dax, has already joined Kaizer Chiefs in camp and will be part of Amakhosi’splans for the 2018-19 season. Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung confirmed yesterday that they were still negotiating with Dax’s Malagasy club Fosa Juniors regarding compensations for the attacking midfielder’s transfer. Fosa Juniors initially challenged Chiefs, saying they did not follow proper procedure when they signed the 27-year-old and that the player was still contracted to them until 2020. But Motaung told SunSport yesterday that talks were underway and they would soon clear everything up with Fosa Juniors. “You know, signing players from the Cosafa Cup can bring about such challenges,” said the Chiefs boss. “And now we find ourselves in the middle of such a situation but it will be resolved once we agree on compensation. We knew when they came up that it had everything to do with money, more than anything else. We signed the player and that is final. “This is not the first time that clubs have behaved this way with Chiefs. It happened with Collins Mbesuma and Tenashe Nengomasha too.” Motaung further poured cold water on the mounting rumours that Stuart Baxter could return to Amakhosi. He said: “I will not dwell too much on media speculation. Baxter is contracted elsewhere (Safa as Bafana Bafana coach).” But SunSport has been reliably informed that talks between Chiefs and Baxter are underway. Motaung pleaded with their supporters to be “calm and patient” to allow them space to bring a credible coach to Naturena. “Chiefs are an international brand. We cannot be in a rush to employ someone. Mabedi has been doing a great job. “He has been a perfect replacement for Steve (Komphela) after Steve left before the end of last season. He has shown he is capable. “He is now looking after the team in camp and we are positive he is doing a good job,” concluded Motaung.
