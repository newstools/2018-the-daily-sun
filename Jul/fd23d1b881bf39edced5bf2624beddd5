AN ELECTRONICS expert who was bust spying on his
estranged wife was this week sent to prison. According to The
Sun, Ross Cairns (35) from Greater Manchester in England had installed a
system worth as much as £100 000 (about R1,7 million) in their home that
remotely controlled the lighting, central heating and alarm system. But when they split up in 2016, Cairns moved out of the
house and used an app on his phone to connect to the system’s audio facility. He then tuned in to listen to the conversations of his
wife Catherine Cairns (33). During the hearing, Catherine said: “I wanted to keep
things friendly with Ross because of the kids. I was discussing it with my mum
in the kitchen. We were standing right next to the ELAN system and at the time
Ross was at home at his mum's house. “I told my mum I didn't love him anymore. My parents
left, then I started getting various angry messages from Ross. “The next thing I knew, he was downstairs telling the
kids he was moving back in. “'He repeated the conversation that I had with my mum. He
said, ‘Oh, you don't love me anymore’.” Ross also hacked into Catherine’s Facebook accounts and account
on a dating app, sending an intimate picture and obscene messages to men. Judge John Potter sentenced Ross to 11 months in jail
after it emerged he also had a suspended sentence from last year for fraud and
theft. He was also banned from contacting Catherine for three
years. The couple had been married for 16 years and have two
daughters aged five and three.
