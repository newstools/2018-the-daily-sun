KWAZULU Natal cops have been kept busy over the past couple of days, with the discovery of several explosive devices in Durban. The first devices was founds at a Woolworths store in Gateway Mall. KZN cops also confirmed on Saturday that explosive devices were found before they exploded near the Greyville Racecourse. In May, there was also an explosive device that was found at a Mosque in Durban. Following the Greyville Racecourse explosive devices that were found, another scary incident hit a Spar Supermarket in Wentworth. Police Spokesperson Captain MP Gumede said it is alleged that a 10-year-old boy arrived at the supermarket and gave the manager a brown envelope containing a bullet. The brown envelope allegedly had a handwritten letter inside: “The letter was received by the manager and in that letter it stated that, put money inside the bag and leave the bag outside the supermarket otherwise a bomb will explode and do not call the police,” Gumede said. Gumede said the boy who delivered that letter alleged that it was given to him by an unknown man with the instruction to deliver it. “The manager then brought the envelope personally at the police station, being accompanied by the boy. The police attended and cordoned off the scene. The Bomb Disposal Unit arrived and explosive dog search inside the supermarket and a black plastic packet was found on the entrance near the tills,” Gumede added. He said the device was destroyed and no injuries were sustained, and there was no damage to the property.
