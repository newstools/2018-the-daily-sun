VICTIMS of family violence and rape can now enjoy some privacy when they open cases at Acornhoek Police Station. On Friday, the Coca-Cola company donated two structures with a bed and table in each to the station. These will be used as places of safety for abuse victims. Mpumalanga district manager Robin Scherpenhuyzen said they saw a need for the donation. “We want to help those who keep our community safe and stabilise our relationship with police and residents in this cluster. “A victim empowerment centre is really needed here because previously, rape victims had to wait a long time before being interviewed while others were scared to report cases when there was no privacy.” “We hope from now onwards, residents will feel free and safe to talk when they come to the police station.” Captain Mpho Nonyane said as police, they feel blessed to have the structures at the station. “Before this, victims were suffering because we didn’t have the resources to cater for them, especially those who came to report rape cases,” said Nonyane.
