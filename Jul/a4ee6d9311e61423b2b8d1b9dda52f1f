Good hygiene prevents the spread of many diseases including deadly waterborne diseases. WaterAid’s State of Hygiene in Southern Africa report found that poor hygiene is a big cause of a number of diseases in southern Africa. The worst of the diseases include cholera outbreaks in Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe as well typhoid, hepatitis E and more recently listeriosis outbreaks in Mzansi. The report said less than half of the rural population in Southern Africa has access to a decent toilet, as recorded by the Joint Monitoring Programme. This means the most disadvantaged communities are vulnerable to diseases which trap them in a cycle of poverty. The report’s other key findings - Open defecation is a significant public health risk but is especially in the region’s rural areas. - Basic handwashing with soap and water is practised by fewer than one in every four people out of the eight countries for which data are available. - The lack of clean drinking water creates significant risk of contamination of collected water. - Data on food and menstrual hygiene management are poor. Food and menstrual hygiene data are not included in standardised data sources and are rarely included in routine monitoring at any level.
