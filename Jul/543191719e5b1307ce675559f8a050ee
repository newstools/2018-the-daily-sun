AROUND the middle of the year is when some of us get pay rises. But your excitement about the raise will depend on how you use it. Gerald Mwandiambira, a certified financial planner, said you must use your raise to empower your future and protect yourself against emergencies with a rainy day fund. “You work hard for your money so don’t let the fuel and VAT increases eat it all up. “Make sure your money also works hard for you.” He said while you must set saving targets, you must also aim to save enough money equal to three months of your income. “Once you have achieved this, increase your rainy day fund to equal six months of your income. “This will help you cope with life’s surprise expenses, from the good – a wedding or a new baby – to the bad – a road accident or funeral.” To make your money work, you must sacrifice yourself for it every day. Stay committed to saving for a sunnier future tomorrow and dig deep for the discipline you need. “Most of us struggle with saving but there is an easy solution that will keep you on track – automation.” A special account: Open a savings account at your bank and arrange for a debit order to be paid into it after your pay has been received. A second thirteenth cheque: Ask your employer to hold back a fixed amount from your salary every month. The money is saved and is paid to you at a certain time – like a 13th cheque – that’s paid to you in a time when money is normally tight, such as January when you need it to pay for school expenses. Retirement fund increase: Ask your employer’s human resources department to pay more into your retirement fund. Choose a set amount to be deducted each month. Join a savings group: A stokvel or savings club will help you save for the whole year and when you have reached your target, you can invest your savings somewhere safe.
