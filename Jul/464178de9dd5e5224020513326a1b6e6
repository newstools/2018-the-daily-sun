THEY sent their two sons to install smash-and-grab tint in their new car, but little did they know they would not see the two again. Thabang (28) and Katleho Mogayila (20), from Diepkloof in Soweto, did not return home after they went to Alberton, Ekurhuleni, on 27 June to have the smash-and-grab tint installed. The Mogayila family said they received an SMS from one of their sons saying they were on their way back. But this was after days of no contact from the brothers. Their phones were off from the day they went missing. Speaking to Daily Sun, their parents, Marcia and Solly, said all they wanted was for their sons to come home alive and well. “We are sad our sons are missing. This is the first time it has happened. We wonder what might have happened to them,” said Marcia. Solly pleaded with Mzansi to help find their sons. “Someone might have seen our red VW Up with the registration HK 60 ST GP roaming the streets. It might be hijacked or it may be them driving it. Please help us reunite with them,” he said. Captain Phephi Matlou-Mteto, the Diepkloof police spokeswoman, confirmed that a missing persons case had been opened. “Investigations are under way. We are keeping in contact with the family as we work on the case,” she said.
