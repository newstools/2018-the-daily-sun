A MARRIED man juggling nine girlfriends at the same time found himself abruptly dropped by all of them – and revealed as a liar. According to iHarare, Zimbabwean Canaan Kanyera thought he had scored big when nine prospective brides responded to his ad in an online dating column. One was even prepared to divorce her husband to marry him. For a while, Canaan was able to deceive the nine interested women. One of his former girlfriends named only as Tabeth explained how it went down: “We exchanged photographs and his images were so clear and he looked handsome. I thought my prayer for a good husband was answered but little did I know that marriage is not easily found through social media. “He would ask other ladies to stay outside as we romanced in another room and would dismiss me and engage the others like that.” Eventually the nine women got wise to his antics and decided to teach him a lesson. “One day we united against him and confronted him over dating several women pretending as if he was looking for a better one to marry,” said Tabeth. The confrontation left him “bruised and regretting” his behaviour, admitted Canaan – especially since it seems the married woman’s angry husband joined the furious women. It also emerged that Canaan had lied about himself in his online bio. Not only was he not a businessman, he was already married!
