SHE IS the most energetic gogo that they know. And on Saturday her family celebrated an amazing 100 years of life for Josephina Maraka at her home in Mapetla, Soweto. “We often shout at her to sit down but she does not want to. She said she enjoys being able to do things on her own without help,” said her niece, Nompilo Makhanyi (48). Gogo Josephina told Daily Sun that while she feels blessed and happy God has kept her alive this long, she is sad that all the people she knew of her age had died. She was born on 7 July 1918. She has witnessed many political transitions in the country. Josephina had five kids, but two of them have died. She also has 12 grandkids. Her husband died in 1979 and she never remarried. “I loved my husband very much and I never wanted to be with another man after his death. It was difficult because I felt lonely, crying over missing him,” said the gogo. She said the last person of her age that she knew was the late former president, Nelson Mandela. Nompilo said her gogo was still able to cook, wash the dishes and catch a taxi on her own, all without the use of a walking stick. Gogo said she always followed the doctor’s orders and prepared her meals with very little sugar and salt. “I never skip my blood pressure medication. When my peers started drinking, I stayed away,” she said.
