MUSA Nyatama would readily trade his awards for a league title. The Orlando Pirates “man of the moment” scooped all three major trophies at Bucs’ awards ceremony last week, collecting Player of the Season, Players’ Player of the Season and Fan Favourite. But throughout his career, now spanning 10 years, Nyatama has never won a league championship. He feels there will never be a better opportunity for him to fulfil his lifelong goal than the present as he prepares for his 10th PSL season. “I’ve never won a league title and that’s the one goal that drives me every season,” said Nyatama. “These personal achievements will never be enough if I don’t have a league medal. “We have the team to win the league. Through dedication and commitment we can achieve all our goals in the new season.” To some, Nyatama was a surprise recruit for Pirates last season, plucked from Bloemfontein Celtic where he was consistent without being exceptional. But with his ever-improving form for the Buccaneers, the 30-year-old could well add to his national team call-up. He is looking to recapture the form that caught Mamelodi Sundowns’ attention during his Maritzburg United days. But more important, he relishes the Caf Champions League challenge. As part of the preparation for the daunting season ahead, coach Milutin Sredojevic took his troops on a trip to Zambia last week, giving them a taste of the rigours of the continental football. “We had a good trip out there. We learned a lot in a short period and can’t wait for the season to begin,” Nyatama concluded.
