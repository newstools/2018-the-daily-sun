THERE was chaos in Kimberley two weeks ago when gatvol residents wanted the mayor out. Residents also called for the chief financial officer, Lydia Mahloko and the municipal manager, Goolam Akhawaray, to step down. Their pleas didn’t fall on deaf ears. Sol Plaatje mayor Mangaliso Matika was given the boot on Wednesday after a motion of no confidence by opposition parties in the Northern Cape. Residents had planned to shut the city down if the mayor didn’t resign. But they called off the mass march that was set to take place yesterday. Mahloko and Akharwaray have been suspended following the violent protests. DA provincial leader Andrew Louw said: “We have long fought for Matika’s removal as mayor as he has shown time and again he’s not fit to lead the municipality. “We welcome the support we received from councillors of the EFF, the Freedom Front Plus and the ANC.” Louw said service delivery collapsed under Matika’s leadership. “We call on the new mayor, Pule Thabane, to avoid errors that his predecessor made.” ANC provincial secretary Deshi Ngxanga said: “The meeting was illegal and the ANC will seek an urgent court order to set it aside. This is a desperate attempt by the DA to take over the governance of the city. “As for ANC councillors who collaborated with the opposition, the ANC constitution dictates they must be suspended and subject to a disciplinary process.” Municipal spokesman Sello Matsie couldn’t be reached for comment.
