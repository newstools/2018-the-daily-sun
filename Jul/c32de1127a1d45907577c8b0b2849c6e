A MAN in his 30s, who was seen in a video shooting himself on the highway, is believed to have killed himself to avoid jail time. Sdu Sithole shocked the people of Umlazi, south of Durban on Sunday when he shot himself in the middle of Mangosuthu highway. In the video, Sdu is seen standing next to his car. It appeared as if he was talking on the phone before shooting himself. A source said Sdu was a businessman in V Section. He said he allegedly confronted a woman who owed him R30 000 before shooting her. “He was talking to his friends and asking for advice before he shot himself. He told them he had killed a woman who owed him money. “His friends apparently told him to hand himself over to the cops,” said the source. Sdu allegedly posted on Facebook that he had killed a woman. Written in Zulu, part of the post read: “I have killed a woman who owed me, but don’t know whether I should hand myself over to the police or not.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident. He said an inquest docket has been opened. Zwane said he was not aware of the allegation that the man had killed a woman who owed him money.
