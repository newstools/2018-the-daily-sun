EBERT Muthubi (60) has always dreamt of owning a double-storey house. When he realised he couldn’t afford to build a brick house, the madala from extension 78 of Greenside, Limpopo came up with another plan. Ebert is the proud owner of five-roomed, double-storey shack. The shack has three bedrooms, a kitchen and a lounge. He said his shack has turned him into a local celebrity. “At first people thought I was losing my mind but I’m happy everything went according to plan,” he said. He said although his shack did not cost much to make, residents and passersby can’t take their eyes off it. Ebert said he worked as a bricklayer for 20 years. “I used the experience I gained to build this mansion.” He said he made the shack from building material gathered at dumpsites. Ebert said the second floor is the biggest attraction. “Lots of children in the area visit me because they enjoy being upstairs.” He said the second floor has the best view in his kasi. “Sometimes I sit upstairs and watch the soccer matches that take place at the local sports ground. It’s just as good as being at a stadium.”
