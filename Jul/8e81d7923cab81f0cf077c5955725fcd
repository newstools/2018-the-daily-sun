A COP attempting to restore peace to a warring tavern
apparently collapsed and died after realising that he had shot his friend
during the chaos. According to Daily
Monitor, Siraj Tibata was station commander of Molo cop shop in Tororo,
eastern Uganda. He arrived with other cops at Aqua’s drinking joint at
1am on Monday after reports of a fight breaking out. Eyewitness John Opio told Daily Monitor: “Tibata had led other officers to the drinking joint
to contain the chaos but during the fracas, he accidentally shot one Dominic
Omaset. Shortly afterwards, he collapsed and died under unclear circumstances.” Tibata was rushed to the nearby Hope clinic but was
declared dead on arrival. Omaset was apparently a friend of Tibata. Resident John Emiriat said: “We suspect that he died of
shock after realising that he had shot Dominic.” Emiriat is furious with the residents fighting in the
tavern, describing Tibata as a disciplined officer. “They provoked police officers to fire bullets. This is
very wrong and unacceptable. We have to be law abiding citizens,” Emiriat said. No one has been arrested for Tibata’s death and cops are
investigating.
