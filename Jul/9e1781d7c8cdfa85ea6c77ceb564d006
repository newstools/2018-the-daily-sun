ABOUT 600 non-teaching staff vacancies have been advertised by the Eastern Cape Department of Education. The positions are to be filled by the end of the month. Themba Kojana, education HOD, said the massive recruitment drive is to ensure more efficient service delivery to the people. “Our aim is to move from the bottom of the ladder in terms of school performance to a better, more reasonable position,” he said. “We intend to recruit suitably qualified professionals.” He said security posts are awarded based on each school’s risk assessment. “The people will be placed on a shift basis according to the results of the risk assessment,” said Kojana. He said no school will be left out, provided it submitted its requests. “The posts we have advertised include more than 600 non-teaching staff,” he said. “There are also more than 30 directors and assistant directors posts advertised, 14 schools will have guards for the first time, while 17 others will receive caretakers. Other jobs include 46 school cleaners and 500 interns.” Kojana also invited new graduates to grab the opportunity and apply as there are 500 internships available to be filled. He believes this will ensure they receive experience and on the job training.
