THE Mopani District Municipality has distanced itself from a fake jobs advert that is doing the rounds on social media. The municipality says the jobs on the advert are old
positions. Mopani District Municipalityâ€™s spokesperson Witness Tiva said
the 16 posts were advertised in July 2017 and people have already been
appointed to those positions. "The closing date for the positions was the 20th of
July 2017. The district municipality is currently experiencing a number of
applicants who flocking to its offices in Giyani to submit applications,"
Tiva said. He urged job seekers to ignore the advert that is currently
making rounds on social media. Tiva said the municipality will institute an investigation
to establish what led to the old positions, to circulate on social media and
other platforms. He further urged members of the public to guard against
people who are taking advantage and are trying to make a quick buck.
