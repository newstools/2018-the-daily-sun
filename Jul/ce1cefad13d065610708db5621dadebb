IT WAS a scene of horror that no one would want to witness. Residents of New Eersterust, in northern Tshwane believe they will be haunted by Simon Muthovi’s terrified screams forever. The 53-year-old was mauled to death by three vicious dogs! One of the residents told Daily Sun that Simon’s screams were still ringing in his ears following the bloody attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The helpless man was left heavily bleeding when the residents chased the killer animals away. He was rushed to hospital but sadly died. The residents said the dogs had been causing trouble all over the kasi. Simon’s father, Johannes Mothovi (93), said he heard his son singing as he approached the house. At first he thought Simon was drunk when he started screaming, but woke up when he could hear that he was in pain. “When I got there he was on his knees and the dogs were all over him. I asked my wife to give me a steel rod and I fought them with it. The dogs were very powerful. They were about to overpower me when some neighbours woke up and came to help,” he said. The madala said he found it hard to believe that the dogs’ owners, who are their neighbours, didn’t hear anything. “There was screaming everywhere. We called them by their names and even threw stones on their roof but still they didn’t wake up,” he said. Madala Johannes believes that had the neighbours woken up, his son would be alive. Simon’s sister, Magdeline Mahlanya (58), said she wanted the dogs’ owners to pay for a casket for her brother and make sure he had a dignified funeral. The neighbours’ son said he had been trying to get rid of the dogs when they attacked Simon. He said they were very sorry for what happened and would find a way to help Simon’s family. The residents stood by and applauded when the dogs were loaded into the SPCA van. SPCA inspector Meshack Matlou said a vet would determine the dogs’ fate. Temba police spokesman Constable Herman Moremi said police an inquest docket was opened.
