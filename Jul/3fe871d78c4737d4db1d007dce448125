CAPE Town has opened the doors of its Safe Space facility for street people. The pilot project under Culemborg Bridge on the Foreshore is a temporary shelter where up to 230 street people can spend the night. They can use toilet and washing facilities, and there is drinking water and storage space. The homeless people can access social and medical services, with assessments and referrals done on site. Short-term work opportunities will be made available through the Expanded Public Works Programme. Social services mayoral committee member JP Smith said: “The concept has been talked about for many years and planning started last year. “We hope to achieve a number of things through this project. We want to take pressure off existing shelters and stop people breaking by-laws by sleeping and erecting structures in the open. “We hope to develop relationships with our clients over time that will hopefully lead to reintegration for some,” he said. People will be given a locker, sleeping pallet, sleeping bag and blanket, as well as a wellness pack. The city is partnering with service providers to bring specialist services, soup kitchens and catering services to provide meals. A company has been appointed to clean the site three times a week. Daily cleaning tasks will be performed by street people through the public works programme. City Health will also visit for control and to do medical service referrals. A police team will provide security. The Safe Space is expected to be fully operational next week.
