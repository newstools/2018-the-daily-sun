Mzansi rapper, Jack Parow is currently nursing a pretty big wound on his leg. The rapper, whose real name is Zander Tyler was cut by broken glass on stage during a performance this past week. The Cooler as Ekke hit-maker was performing at Aandklas, a Rock and Roll bar in Stellenbosch, Western Cape. He told TshisaLive that "someone broke a glass on stage but I didn't see it and during my performance it sliced my knee open. I didn't realise I was cut until all I could see was red”. He also told the publication that he continued performing for the remaining 40 minutes of the set, after which he partied. Jack is apparently fine and letting the wound heal “naturally”. Thanx for last night @aandklasstellenbosch ITS WAS FKN MAL!! Got the #stitches to prove it.
