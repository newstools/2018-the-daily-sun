NOLITA Tshaisa (45) has been trying to get the title deed to her late husband’s house since 2002, with no luck. But her prayers were finally answered on Saturday when ward 98 councillor Anele Gabuza handed over title deeds to her and about 34 other residents with the same problem in Harare, Khayelitsha. “I struggled to get a title deed. At the time of my husband’s death, I was using my own surname,” she said. “Now with the help of Councillor Gabuza, I’ve finally received it. I’m now the real owner of my house.” Gabuza said he had processed 375 title deeds this year. Although most people didn’t receive them yesterday, he said they were ready and just needed to be collected. “I realised many people in my ward had problems getting title deeds, so I intervened. I’m glad we managed to assist some of them,” he said. Vuyani Tom (43), who received the title deed to his late mum’s house, said: “When you don’t have a title deed, you don’t feel secure. I’m very happy today,” he told Daily Sun. Most people who spoke to the People’s Paper said they’d been waiting for their title deeds for about 10 years.
