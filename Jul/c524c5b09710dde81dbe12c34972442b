A THUG arrested for armed robbery and attempted murder
said he had no regrets because he was doing it so his wife could have all her
heart desired. According to Punch,
Janya Shehu (20) was bust with fellow gangster Jariri Chede (25) on Saturday
after they allegedly brutally attacked the driver of a van transporting goods
from the market in Kokongi, north-west Nigeria. Cops said the driver, Sunday Ishaya, was on a remote road
between villages when three thugs jumped out of the bushes, forcing Sunday to
stop. They held him up at gun point and slashed him with a panga, leaving him
in a pool of blood. They then allegedly took N70 000 (about R2 600) in cash
and his cellphone valued at N73 000 (about R2 700). They also allegedly stole
two cartons of gin valued at N9 000 (about R335) and a box of snuff worth N2
000 (about R75). But cops quickly caught up with Shehu and Chede, although
they’re still hunting the third gangster. Shehu, who recently got married, told Punch he had no regrets. “I don’t want my wife to lack for anything; I can do
anything to please her. I promised her that I will do everything to please her
no matter what – until I found myself in a police net. “I have no regrets because I voluntarily, willingly
committed the crime so it doesn’t make sense to say I’m regretting it. It is
between me and Allah.” But Shehu did admit that this wasn’t going to go down
well with both his wife and his family. “My wife definitely will feel bad but I committed the
crime so let me go in for it. As for my parents, I have disappointed them and I
pray they will forgive me,” said Shehu. The two suspects are due to appear in court soon.
