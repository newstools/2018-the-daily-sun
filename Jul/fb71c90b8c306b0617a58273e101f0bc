THE MINISTER of Public Works and the special investigating unit have been investigating 16 000 suspicious transactions to the value of R2 billion in the department. Minister Thulas Nxesi briefed the media in Tshwane on their plans to combat fraud and corruption in the department. “I also found that 684 appointments had been pushed through in four months,” he said. Nxesi said this meant the budget is spent largely on non-essential posts and there was little money left for important technical and professional appointments. He also called for a lifestyle audit, starting with himself. He said he called for the audit after anonymous documents appeared with unsupported allegations that he was stealing millions of rands from the department. “We must also be careful not to be distracted by dirty tricks of criminal syndicates that remain entrenched in the department.” He said Mzansi now has a leader in President Cyril Ramaphosa who is committed to stamping out corruption. “He is turning the tide against state capture which brought this country to the brink of disaster.” Imtiaz Fazel, the department’s acting director general, said there was a growing trend of officials who resigned when they are being investigated. Fazel said about 250 cases of corruption have been heard and 193 have resulted in suspension, written warnings and dismissals. Andy Mothibi, head of the investigating unit, said they would not spare anyone in their probes.
