KAITANO Tembo has eight weeks to prove that he can take over as the club’s head coach on a permanent basis, as the board prefer him to any of the other candidates. The club’s board will meet in the first week of August to deal with a number of matters within the club, but the most important matter will be the appointment of a head coach. And Tembo’s name is top of the list! Actually, the position is his to lose, if what CEO Stan Matthews told SunSport is anything to go by. “He ended the season fairly well and it is only proper for us to give him a chance,” Matthews said. “He must just prove himself to become big. He is under no pressure, we’re not panicking and in no rush – but remember, football is all about results.” He revealed that they have spoken to a number of foreign and local coaches who applied for the job, but their trust still lies with Tembo despite the other options available to them. “Look, Kaitano is the one who said he was not ready when Stuart Baxter announced that he was leaving us,” Matthews said. “I think he is ready now. There will be no big sword over his head to do anything. “Kaitano is a long-term asset for us. We just have to rally around him.” In essence, Tembo is in charge. Matsatsantsa a Pitori will open their 2018-19 season with a duel with Cape Town City FC away at Cape Town Stadium on 4 August (6pm).
