A REAL leader is not afraid to get his hands dirty. On Tuesday Sindisiwe Xulu, head of Mpumalanga’s roads and transport department, joined residents of Msogwaba near Tekwane as they filled potholes in the area. Xulu said the department was grateful to the residents who helped improve the condition of the kasi’s roads. “We appreciate your hard work. “The department plans to work closely with other communities to make Mpumalanga a province without potholes,” she said. Resident Thulani Nkosi said he has no problem volunteering for a cause that makes a difference. “We hope motorists will drive without fear of damaging their vehicles. “Motorists end up driving on the pavement because the roads are filled with potholes,” he said. The department has short and long-term plans in place to address the province’s pothole problem. In the short term, the department plans to fill potholes, clean drainage systems and cut the grass growing on roadsides. The department has set aside R2 billion, which is 44% of its budget, for the design, construction and maintenance of the province’s road network. The War on Potholes programme was launched last year. The initiative’s stakeholders include municipalities, government agencies, the private sector and ordinary residents.
