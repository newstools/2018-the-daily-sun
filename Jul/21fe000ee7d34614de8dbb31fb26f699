The Inkatha Freedom Party members picketed outside SABC
in Auckland Park on Wednesday. They were picketing against the lack of coverage for their
party by the public broadcaster. Hundreds of members joined senior members of the party as
they descended on SABC . Provincial Secretary Alco Ngobese believes that the SABC
is biased towards the ANC. “We had a big event on 16 June and they did not cover it. “We feel like we are treated as though we are not
citizens of the country, but we also pay taxes,” he said. IFP Leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi addressed members of the
media outside SABC. “The SABC some time ago requested a meeting with us. “There are some issues that we also wanted to discuss
with them, and we felt that we should come and talk to them. “We are hoping that after this, there will be cordial and
normal relationships because we do not expect the public broadcaster to take
sides with any political party,” Buthelezi said. He stressed the importance of having a relationship with
the SABC. “We are still active like any other party, and we need to
have a normal relationship with them. “We as
stakeholders are able to be given our fair time of coverage through the channels
whether it’s radio or TV,” he said. Buthelezi refused to reveal the contents of his meeting
with the SABC. “We cannot talk publicly about everything we discuss, but
we did talk about the past, and we mentioned our relationship with them. “They understood our grievances and the issues that we
raised and we hope that from now they’ll have the normal relationship with us
that they have with other parties. We didn’t come for special treatment.”
