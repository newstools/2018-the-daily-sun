SPEAKERS at the funeral service for a taxi owner spoke out against the killing of innocent commuters. William Nethononda (65), a taxi owner from block F in Thohoyandou, Limpopo was gunned down outside his house last week. Nethononda had been receiving death threats and enlisted the services of a security guard. Relatives, friends, and representatives from various taxi associations attended his funeral service at CWC Church in Maniini. Memory Madigoe, chairwoman of the South African National Taxi Council’s women’s desk, condemned Nethononda’s killing. “Enough is enough. These killings must stop. We are appealing to church leaders to pray for this to come to an end. “Law enforcement agencies must take charge and arrest the culprits,” she said. Venda-Joburg Taxi Association representative Eric Mudeli said: “We have lost a great man. He was one of the founders of this association and always gave us advice when we faced challenges.”
