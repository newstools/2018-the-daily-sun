MZANSI’S power couple Basetsana and Romeo Kumalo emerged from court victorious yesterday. The Randburg Magistrates Court in Joburg ruled in their favour and against author Jackie Phamotse. This comes after Basetsana and Romeo opened a crimen injuria case against Phamotse over comments she made on Twitter about them. She claimed the two were involved in making a gay sex tape with a young rapper. Although she didn’t mention their names in the tweet, her followers soon came to the conclusion she was talking about Basetsana and Romeo. This led to the court holding Phamotse responsible for comments made by her followers. Yesterday, magistrate Helen Banks ruled Phamotse must remove her tweets and not talk publicly about the couple. This was because social media users started harassing the power couple. The court granted the couple a protection order against the author. Basetsana was all smiles when the ruling was made. When contacted for comment yesterday, Phamotse said: “I can’t comment on the matter now but I will release a statement tomorrow.”
