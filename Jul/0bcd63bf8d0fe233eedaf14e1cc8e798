“I AM half happy and half unhappy with what I heard.” These were the words of Gauteng Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza when she went to the Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa Centre in Tshwane for a site visit inspection. The visit on Thursday came after a newspaper report that R7 million in funding had disappeared. The money from the department was meant to provide clothing and food for neglected, abused and orphaned kids. Mayathula-Khoza said she was worried after seeing a picture of kids wearing torn clothes. “I’ve come here to get to the bottom of the truth and listen to management,” she said. She said the report appeared to be a hoax and that she understood there had been many challenges, with kids not getting grants due to the small budget. “I’m informed that R3 million has been spent on emergency situations and having to fix things that are broken,” she said. She said although some details in the report appeared to be true, others were made up. “As we were inspecting, we went to the laundry and I saw order,” she said. “I was told they didn’t keep torn clothing yet I had seen a child wearing a torn uniform. “The staff must do something about it.”
