ANC chief whip in parliament, Jackson Mthembu, said former MP Mduduzi Manana’s resignation shows he has taken responsibility for his actions. “His voluntary resignation from parliament coupled with his resignation from the executive in 2017 is indicative of someone who has shown remorse for his actions relating to his involvement in a gender-based violence case where a court of law found him guilty,” said Mthembu. Parliament yesterday confirmed that Speaker Baleka Mbete had received a letter of resignation from Manana on Tuesday. He said there was mounting pressure for him to step down. He will not appear before parliament’s ethics committee. On Monday, the NPA decided against charging Manana for allegedly pushing his former domestic worker down the stairs at his home. The DA said Manana’s resignation was nothing more than an attempt to avoid being held accountable by the ethics committee. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said if parliament can’t hold Manana to account then it is up to the ANC to do so.
