“EVEN though our dad left us money, we are poor.” Bongani Ngwenya (30) from Moshengu kasi in Atteridgeville, west of Tshwane said his dad, Thomas Ngwenya (58), died in January. He and his two brothers went to his workplace to claim his money but they received surprising news. “We were told that our dad was married, but our mum who died in 2001 was never married to our dad. They only stayed together,” he said. Bongani said they then went to Home Affairs to get to the bottom of this problem. “Home Affairs officials confirmed that our dad had been married to a Chinese woman named Huang Huiming. “A marriage record says they tied the knot in 2001.” The brothers say their father never mentioned this to them. “We were very close to our dad and he loved our mum. “It’s impossible that he married another woman without our knowledge,” he said. Another brother, Mandla Ngomana (27), said they needed the woman to come forward so that they can share their dad’s money. He said the only way that they could be given the money was if they had a letter of authority from their father’s wife. “Our last hope is Daily Sun. Maybe the woman will see the article and then come forward,” he said. Mandla said their young brother, Harris, needed money for school. “We need this money now more than ever. Harris has been at home because we don’t have the money to send him back to school,” he said.
