HE IS dangerous and must be locked away. This was the message from protesters outside the Butterworth Magistrates Court on Friday. Yandisa Cebisa (32) appeared in the court after allegedly stabbing two men in Cuba kasi, Butterworth last Tuesday. The incident happened after Yandisa had an argument with his wife. When the men tried to intervene, Yandisa allegedly stabbed them, killing one of the men. Angry residents bust Yandisa at the local taxi rank as he tried to run away from his crime. Lucas Tandwa, a member of the community policing forum, said: “We searched for Yandisa all over the kasi until some people saw him at the taxi rank. He was trying to catch a taxi to Cape Town, but we managed to bust him.” A resident said: “The suspect must rot in jail. He is a dangerous.” Magistrate Ndileka Nombewu-Bomela postponed the case to next Tuesday for the suspect to apply for a legal representative. Yandisa has been kept in jail.
