VOOV TV is closing just a few months after it was launched on DStv. MultiChoice has decided to remove the channel at the end of the month. The channel, which was made up of content created on the Voov app, introduced many fresh faces to Mzansi and gave public figures a platform to show their talent. TV and radio host Kuli Roberts, actor and presenter Khanyi Mbau, and YouTube sensations Lasizwe and Moshe were among those who made regular contributions to the channel. MultiChoice said it decided to stop airing the channel as it had not done as well as expected. Voov was launched in November and people who live-streamed over the app could spontaneously be featured on TV.
