Mduduzi Matukane survived a horror crash in March. The 18-year-old has spent three months in hospital waiting for his broken hip to be fixed. His mum Mildred Ndlovu (36)  said doctors at Matikwane Hospital in KaBokweni Village told her she had to pay R70 000 to get the operation done. She said she was told the hospital couldn’t perform the operation and that she had to go to a private hospital. The worried mum from Marite, near Hazyview in Mpumalanga said she’s been sent from pillar to post and her son was in terrible pain. “I don’t have money. I can’t afford a private hospital because I’m unemployed. “If I don’t get that money, my son will have to endure the pain and lie there drinking painkillers.” Daily Sun contacted Dumisani Malamule, spokesman for the Mpumalanga Department of Health. He said Mduduzi was sent to Themba Hospital for treatment. “However, doctors recommended a tertiary level care due to the nature of the injury. “That’s why the patient was sent back to Matikwane Hospital to arrange for a transfer to Rob Ferreira Hospital.” Malamule said Mduduzi was tranferred to Rob Ferreira for an examination by a specialist yesterday. An excited Mildred told the People’s Paper she hopes her son will get his life back when he finally sees a specialist.
