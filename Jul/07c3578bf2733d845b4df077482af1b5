THE Marikana Eight were all found guilty of murdering Sabata Chale. Aubrey Seitsang (39), Sibonile Sobopha (32), Herbert Bexesi (38), William Nyenyani (33), Samson Gqwetani (52), Gift Luvela (39), Luvo Soyizwaphi (32) and Mzolisi Mbulane (48) were convicted and sentenced in the North West High Court sitting in Mogwase, near Rustenburg. Judge Ronnie Hendricks rejected the evidence by the eight who claimed they did not participate in killing Chale (39), allegedly over the allocation of low-cost housing in Marikana West. The judge said they all took part in the murder. Chale was chased out of his house on 8 December 2016. He ran into a neighbour’s yard but was cornered and hacked to death with pangas and axes. Some of the attackers apparently stuck their hands into his wounds and sucked his blood. They then left the crime scene agreeing that no one should ever talk about what had happened. “They acted with a common goal,” said Hendricks yesterday. The judge sentenced them to 20 years each for murder.
