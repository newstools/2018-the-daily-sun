IT happened in 1996 and now it’s happened again. The head of the family, Solomon Sethabela (68) went missing on 13 August 1996 in Maboloka, North West. His son, Sergeant George Sethabela (43) of Westford, Tshwane West disappeared on 14 June. The Sethabela family said they have consulted prophets and sangomas but they are far from solving the mystery. Solomon worked for a clothing company in Joburg when he disappeared and they have not heard any news about him since then. George is employed at the SAPS dog training school in Tshwane West. His brother, Rapoo Sethabela (58) told Daily Sun they have looked for him everywhere without success and they are worried the same thing that happened to Solomon has also happened to George. “Our brother has never disappeared before. This is devastating for the family. “We are worried that he was kidnapped. He left work but never arrived home.” Rapoo said if his brother is out there he must come back. He’s appealing for a powerful sangoma or prophet to help them find their family members. Police spokeswoman Sibongile Vuma said George was last seen wearing a brown jacket, blue trousers and takkies. “A missing person case was opened and police are investigating.” She appealed to anyone who might have information on George’s whereabouts to come forward.
