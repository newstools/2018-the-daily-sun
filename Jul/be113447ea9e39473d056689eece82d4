KZN EDUCATION portfolio committee chairwoman Linda Hlongwa has promised to investigate post fixing allegations at Okumhlophe Secondary School. The school in Umlazi, eThekwini, has been without a principal since July last year. On Friday, parents, pupils and teachers protested at the school gate, demanding that KZN Education department head Enock Nzama come to explain why no principal had been appointed yet. Nzama didn’t go but Hlongwa travelled to the school to accept their memorandum. She said she would call Nzama to the portfolio committee to explain why no principal had been appointed. “The department head and MEC accounted to my committee. “I promise that before the school opens, the issue of the principal will be sorted out,” she said. SGB chairwoman Queen Mkhonde said they decided to protest because Nzama no longer answered their calls. “We have been writing letters and calling him to explain when he will hire a principal. “We are angry because the SGB recommended Mbuyiseni Mathonsi as principal but Nzama refused to release his letter of employment,” she said. Mkhonde said they heard Nzama wanted to hire another principal and suspected the post had been fixed. Interviewing committee chairwoman Zodwa Njapha said all members agreed in February that Mathonsi should be hired. She said the pupils were out of control and had even started abusing drugs as there is no figure of authority at the school. The SunTeam sent Nzama messages but he never responded, nor did he answer his phone yesterday. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said they were attending to the problem. He said the complaints that were lodged had delayed the hiring of a principal.
