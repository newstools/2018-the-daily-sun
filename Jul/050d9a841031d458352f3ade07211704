AFTER a relative’s funeral, Nompumelelo Motha decided to stay behind and help clean up. But she never returned home and now her family is worried. The 34-year-old mum of three from Mhlangeni in Mondlo, northern KZN, went missing on 17 June. Her mum Thembelihle (67) said the family left Nompumelelo at her aunt’s house on a Saturday and she was meant to return home the next day. “That Sunday we got a call from my sister asking if my daughter had returned home because when she woke up, Nompumelelo was gone. My sister said she found Nompumelelo’s phone and clothes in the room she was supposed to sleep in,” she said. Thembelihle said they launched a massive search in the village but even Nompumelelo’s friends had no idea where she was. A neighbour said he last saw her walking to a tavern alone. “We went to the tavern and they told us she bought a drink and left. I found it strange that she just disappeared without a trace because she never left home without saying where she was going, even when she went drinking with friends,” she said. Thembelihle said she believes something bad has happened to her daughter. “We don’t know where to look for her. Her children miss her and my gut tells me she’s not all right, wherever she is. I pray to God that she returns home safely.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a missing person’s docket was opened at Mondlo Police Station. He said: “We appeal to anyone with information to contact Mondlo police on 034 326 7100/1, or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.”
