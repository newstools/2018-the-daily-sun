AT 52, Elizabeth Shabangu from Effingham shacks in Durban still doesn’t have an ID. The mother of three and gogo of eight grandchildren told Daily Sun that she was born in Jozini, KwaZulu-Natal, but her late mum didn’t apply for her birth certificate. “My four siblings also don’t have birth certificates. This didn’t worry us as we didn’t go to school,” she said. But when Elizabeth was looking for a job in Durban, she was asked for her ID. “I went to apply for one at the Home Affairs office in Durban and was told to bring a report card. I told them I didn’t have one as I never went to school,” she explained. Elizabeth added that her children, aged 37, 26 and 13 are affected by this as she could not apply for their birth certificates. “They dropped out of school because they couldn’t provide birth certificates,” she said. “Now my grandchildren, aged between 18 and 2, also don’t have birth certificates. The little ones are still in primary school and their schools haven’t given us problems, but the eldest, who is supposed to be in matric, stopped going to school when she was in grade 9.” Elizabeth is worried that she will die without an ID and leave her children in this mess. “I’d appreciate it if Home Affairs helped me with this matter,” she said. Cyril Mncwabe, Home Affairs spokesman, told the People’s Paper he contacted Elizabeth and discovered that she didn’t have any documents to prove she was born in Jozini. “My advice to her was to get a letter from an induna in the village where she grew up,” said Mncwabe.
