THE Annual Nelson Mandela Lecture invites prominent people to drive debate on significant social issues. It inspires people to discuss difficult subjects in order to address the challenges faced in society. The 44th US President Obama will deliver the lecture today on the eve of Mandela’s 100th birthday. The Nelson Mandela Foundation says it chose Obama to deliver the lecture because he has a global voice and not afraid to take a tough stance on social issues. “Madiba’s 100th year comes only once and it’s important for us to look at people who are inspired by his legacy personally but also who have modelled their own leadership after Madiba, so Obama is that kind of person. “We also looked for a person who can spread that message globally, who has a global platform and voice, who can raise the questions that are uncomfortable that we would like people to engage with,” Director of the Nelson Mandela Foundation Luzuko Koti.
