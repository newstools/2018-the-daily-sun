NOWAYILESI Cila from Kuyasa, Khayelitsha in Cape Town is happy to share her 100th year with Madiba. “I love Nelson Mandela, even though he is no more. He played a huge role in making sure that this country got its freedom,” said gogo Nowayilesi. The former traditional healer told Daily Sun she would love to have a big birthday celebration. “My wish, before I die, is to have a big celebration because I’ve never had a birthday party. Even though my kids and grandkids bought me a cake, I want something big before I die,” said Nowayilesi. The gogo turned 100 on 7 July. She said even though she suffers from high blood pressure and arthritis, she is still strong. “God blessed me with 11 kids, but only four are still alive. I have many grandkids and great grandchildren. “When I die I want to be buried in a cloth that has Mandela’s face on my coffin so I can rest in peace. I wish Madiba was still alive so we could celebrate our birthday month together.” Gogo Nowayilesi lives in a four- room house with her daughter and great grandkids. She has more than 50 grandkids and more than 70 great grandchildren. “There are so many of them. I sometimes forget their names, but I love them,” she said. Gogo’s daughter, Buyelwa Cila (66), said she was grateful to God that her mum is still alive. “I thank the Lord for keeping my mother all these years. “I hope He gives her many more years. My mum is truly blessed.”
