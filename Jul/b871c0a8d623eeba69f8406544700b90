TWO women, who are apparently out-of-work security guards, are out on bail after they were allegedly caught shoplifting at a PEP store on Friday last week. The suspects allegedly stole items worth R4000 at the store in Thulamahashe Plaza in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. They were spotted by vigilant staff members and stopped by the store’s guards at the entrance. “Both women failed to show us slips,” said Tsakani Zitha, a staff member. “One of them threatened me with a knife. “If it wasn’t for the guards, who cuffed them, she would have injured me.” Both women, who claimed to be former security guards, apparently pleaded for mercy and said they were unemployed. They allegedly confessed but insisted they stole to support their kids. Alfred Mgiba, the mall’s senior security guard, confirmed that both women confessed to stealing. They were caught with panties, shoe polish, sheets, pillow cases and belts stuffed inside two new school bags. Two more bags full of washing powder, clothes, chocolate and padlocks were found stashed behind a hawker’s stall at a taxi rank nearby. Sergeant Abigail Nxumalo confirmed that two suspects, both aged 32, were released on R500 bail each. They’re facing shoplifting charges.
