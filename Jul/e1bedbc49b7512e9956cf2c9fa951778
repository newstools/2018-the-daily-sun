SIBUSISO Ntanzi does everything on his bicycle that people do in their cars. The 27-year-old can often be seen cycling around Modder East in Benoni, Ekurhuleni, with his three-year-old son Thokozani. The father of three takes the little boy with him most of the time on job hunting or shopping trips, and Thokozani rides on the back of his dad’s bike. Motorists often hoot at Sibusiso and bystanders cheer, impressed by what a dedicated father he is. He said: “I love my children and will do anything to protect them. “People cheer us on the road and that makes me happy. “I make sure the carrier is fastened well, so my son is safe. “After I’ve been cycling for a while, I always stop to make sure he’s okay.” Sibusiso said he makes sure in winter that Thokozani wears warm clothes so he doesn’t catch a cold. “When it’s raining, I leave him with my relatives.” Sibusiso said although his wife got a piece job recently, she doesn’t earn enough to pay for a creche. “I carry my son on my bicycle almost every day,” he said. “Even when I go to look for a job, he’s with me.” Sibusiso said he makes wardrobes and fits doors and tiles, but business isn’t good because so many people are unemployed. He said he often goes out looking for work to support his family. “My wife is not getting enough and transport to work takes up a lot of her salary.” He said his two other children are in school, and he makes sure he’s there by the time they get home.
