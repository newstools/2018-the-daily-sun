HER husband found a new job and left last Sunday. But his possessive wife thought he was leaving because he was having an affair in Eastern Cape. She allegedly told her husband he would never see her and their two children again. The woman, who is from Barcelona section in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, poisoned their two children, aged seven and 17, on Monday. Cops said she then contacted her husband to tell him she had poisoned them and he could send someone if he did not believe her. She herself then ate some of the poisoned food she had fed the children. A neighbour said the husband sent him to check on his family. “There was no answer when I knocked on the door. I opened the kitchen door but something was blocking it. “I managed to push it open and found the seven-year-old girl by the door and her 17-year-old brother lying not far from her,” said the neighbour. He said the mother was still alive and he immediately called the police and an ambulance. Residents were angry and wanted to moer her as she was being taken to the ambulance. She was rushed to hospital, where nurses were able to drain the poison from her system. The woman is in hospital under police guard and she faces two murder charges. Captain Thabo Sibuyi, KwaThema police spokesman, said they are investigating a case of murder after pathologists confirmed the children’s death was due to poisoning. He said cops were investigating what type of poison was used.
