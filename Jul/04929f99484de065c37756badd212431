SINCE Monday, members of the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union have been protesting at police stations during lunch. Yesterday, there was another protest at Katlehong North Police Station in Ekurhuleni. It included police members and administrative staff who belong to the union. They said they targeted cop stations with the most complaints. The three cop shops identified are Katlehong north and south police stations, as well as Brackendowns, all in Ekurhuleni. Popcru regional spokesman Malusi Bambo said the aim of the protests was to demand that management reacts swiftly to the many challenges the staff face. Malusi said salary increases, victimisation, nepotism and lack of resources top the list. He said in 2011, there was an agreement with management to increase salaries, but they failed to follow through. “Enough is enough. When staff raise their concerns about working under stressful conditions, they are threatened with being fired. “Some cluster commanders are not ashamed to employ their families without following labour laws,” said Bambo. He also said station commanders don’t allow their officers to take leave.“They need to be allowed time to rest, as well as better working conditions to fight crime,” he said. The protests are expected to end on Thursday. A memorandum will be handed over to the police head office next Friday.
