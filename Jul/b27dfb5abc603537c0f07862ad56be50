PROTESTING residents of Zwelihle in Hermanus, Western Cape burnt down their satellite police station three months ago. Now the gogos and madalas are feeling the heat. This is because since the police station was burnt down during a land protest, they are struggling to get affidavits for their new Sassa cards. Monica Manse (66) said: “We have been going up and down to get affidavits to get our new cards. We really miss the satellite station that was burned down because we are suffering.” Nolayisensi Manqentsa (70) said the elders were paying a heavy price. “We are not saying people shouldn’t get their voices heard but they must think of the consequences when they do these things,” she said. Another resident said criminals did as they pleased because they knew it took more than four hours for police from the station in town to respond. An 80-year-old gogo said when they went to the police station in town, they were told to wait because they burned down the satellite station in Zwelihle. “I was surprised when I got that response because anyone can see an elderly person like me would not be able to be part of a protest,” said the angry gogo. Lumka Nyali (31) said she heard a man beating his wife and telling her no one would save her because the cops were far away and too scared to go to Zwelihle. Western Cape police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said the station commander had not received any complaints about service delivery. He advised residents with complaints to phone 028 313 5300. Zwelihle Library was also burned down on Monday and the health department was forced to close the Hermanus Community Day Centre due to protests yesterday.
