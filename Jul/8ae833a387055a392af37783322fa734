MPUMALANGA ANC member Peter Nyoni has vowed to build the Zondo family a house. This comes after their house was gutted by fire last month. The eight family members from Embalenhle in Secunda lost all their possessions in the fire, including their furniture and clothes. They are now living with neighbours. The fire was allegedly started by a man who accused a Zondo family member of cheating with his girlfriend. Nyoni said it was the responsibility of all ANC members to ensure people regained their dignity. “We came here to make a contribution by donating something to make a difference. We want to rebuild the house that was gutted down by fire. “We are here to revive the spirit of Nelson Mandela and it is our responsibility to assist you as ANC members. “What will happen to you and others like you if we don’t help you? “We would have loved to help a lot, but the journey begins with a few steps,” he said. Uncle Khanya December said he was happy the family finally had some help. “The children are scared to come back home because of the incident. “We hope Nyoni’s commitment will erase it,” Khanya said. The family received furniture and stationery in the meantime. Nyoni also donated soccer outfits to football teams and blankets to elders in the area.
