THE South African National Taxi Council (SANTACO) has
partnered with government to transport social grant recipients to pay point
stations. Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu their purpose is
to make sure that as we move forward we can take on board the various
stakeholders and have them understand our challenges. Shabangu met with the national leadership of SANTACO to put
together plans in anticipation for when the Cash Paymaster Services (CPS)
contract ends. She said talking to the transport industry is very important,
because some of the beneficiaries will require transport as they go out to get
their payments. “The department saw a need to meet with leadership of the
national taxi industry in making sure that when the crunch time comes, we are
not found napping or not ready to deal with the situation. I’m very happy that we’ve identified what we need to do and
have set up a team to work together in refining the whole process and ensure
that the collaboration happens in a smooth way,” the Minister said. SANTACO President Philip Taaibosch said the organisation would
sit down, and do a thorough consultation and ensure that they address problems
of grant recipients in the country. “With history you learn that SANTACO, particularly the taxi
industry has been professors in the transportation of people, it’s only at the
later stage we were forgotten. We want to call upon on all departments to say
the taxi industry is ready to deliver your responsibility as government to the
majority of South Africans,” Taaibosch said.
