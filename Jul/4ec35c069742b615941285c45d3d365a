THE mini substation in Eldorado Park, south of Joburg went up in smoke on Thursday, leaving about 12 households in the dark. The families, some of who have babies, have endured the bitter cold since then. Maggie Lyons (46) told Daily Sun she fears for her life because the substation and bare cables are outside her house. “We reported the problem when the electricity box started to emit sparks. “City Power sent people who separated the cables with plastic. “We warned them the plastic would burn but they didn’t listen. “The power utility hires various contractors and some of them don’t know what they’re doing. “They’re putting our lives in danger,” said Maggie. She said the substation is like a ticking time bomb. “So many people tamper with it because they are desperate for electricity and one day someone is going to get hurt.” Councillor Peter Refeti said he asked City Power to assess the situation. “People like to blame me for things I have no control over. “How am I responsible for overloading?” asked the councillor. “City Power went to check the device. “They will go back with all their equipment. “The technicians said they were afraid to work overnight but I assured them I would make sure they were safe, even if it meant I had to be on site with them.” City Power spokesman Sol Masolo confirmed the incident. “Someone stole a cable by cutting it and that’s what caused the fire. We have technicians on site and they will be working overnight. The problem is being sorted out,” he said yesterday.
