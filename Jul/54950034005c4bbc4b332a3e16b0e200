RELATIVES of the late Isaac Modishane are looking for his two missing brothers! The brothers, Charles and Johannes Gumede, have been missing for 30 years. The two, originally from Stinkwater in Tshwane, did not even bury their parents because they were nowhere to be found. Last month their 63-year-old brother died and left an estate. His four siblings, who’re still around, were told to bring the rest of their siblings to claim the estate. Isaac’s nephew Lucas Sepogwane (51) said his uncle Johannes left home to look for a job in Brooklyn, Tshwane. He said they never heard from him again, but people from their village would say they’d seen him in Brooklyn in the 1990s. He said his other uncle Charles is suspected to be in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga. He said they met his son, who gave them his numbers. “We phoned him many times and even sent him messages explaining that his brother had died, but he did not respond,” he said. “We believe my uncle might have a mental problem.” He said the two brothers’ remaining siblings were also desperate to meet them. “The family is worried about their well being.” He appealed to SunReaders who might know them to please come forward. “We also plead with them to please come home if they see this article. We need them.” If you know any of the brothers’ whereabouts, contact Daily Sun’s Tshwane offices on 012 485 9251.
