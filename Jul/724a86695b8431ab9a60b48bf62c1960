THE family of a man who was rescued from an angry crowd on Friday have praised cops. Relatives of Delani Khoza (28) from KwaMashu G section, north of Durban, told Daily Sun if it hadn’t been for the cops, Delani would be dead meat today. The cops from KwaMashu cop shop were patrolling in F section when they saw a suspicious-looking, overloaded car and stopped it. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said, upon searching it, the cops found Delani in the boot, injured and covered in blood. “They were in possession of hammers, sticks and baseball bats suspected to have been used in the commission of a crime,” she said. The victim was taken to hospital. His sister Nonhlanhla (39) said she got a call at work on Friday, telling her Delani had been abducted. “When I came home I was told Delani was with one of his whoonga boy friends on Thursday when the friend robbed a girl of her cellphone,” she said. “Delani has been causing trouble since he started smoking whoonga four years ago. “After this incident, I asked ward committee members on Sunday to demolish his shack. That’s where they kept their stolen items.” Six suspects were bust for kidnapping and assault. They will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court soon.
