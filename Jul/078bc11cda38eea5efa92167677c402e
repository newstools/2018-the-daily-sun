ON SUNDAY morning, residents of Lawley extension 2, Joburg, woke up to a shocking scene. The burnt body of a young man was found in the yard of one of their neighbours. A resident said they were woken up at about 4am by screams coming from the street. “When we got out, we found the body lying there. “We suspect he was a thug and a mob justice victim,” the resident said. Soweto cluster police spokesman Sergeant Khalipha Mvula said they arrested a 43-year-old suspect, at the house where the body was found. “Allegedly, the man and his wife were woken up by the sound of a vehicle stopping next to their home,” Mvula said. “Two unknown men jumped over their main gate and headed towards the back of the yard. “Armed with a traditional stick, the suspect allegedly went outside to investigate. “One of the men escaped but he grabbed the remaining one and apparently assaulted him with the stick, “He was joined by his neighbours, who responded as a result of the victim’s screams.” Mvula said they expect to make more arrests. The identity of the victim, who is believed to be in his early 20s, is still unknown to the police. The suspect is expected to appear in court soon on murder charges.
