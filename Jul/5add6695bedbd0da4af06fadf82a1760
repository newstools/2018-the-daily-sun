THE Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders has threatened that chiefs found to have been involved in illegal circumcisions will be stripped of their titles. The winter circumcision season is almost over, but it has claimed 19 lives. This is despite measures being put in place to curb unnecessary deaths. Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana, chairman of the traditional leaders, said: “It should be gross misconduct for any traditional leader to allow illegal circumcision in their area or associate themselves with those breaking the law. “We would like to propose that these leaders must be suspended and pay heavy fines as stipulated in the act. “They must also be expelled from traditional leadership.” Nonkonyana and Chief Mkhanyiseli Dudumayo, chairman of the OR Tambo District Initiation Forum, said they were disappointed over the number of deaths. OR Tambo reported its 13th death, of 17-year-old Osa Mbongwana, on Wednesday. The notorious traditional surgeon popularly known as Mtshayina, from Libode, where nine initiates died, is still on the run.
