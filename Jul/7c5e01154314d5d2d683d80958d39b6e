THE departments of trade and industry and small business development held a meeting in East London yesterday. The idea behind the event, at the International Convention Centre, was to discuss how to improve the economies of kasis and rural areas. Deputy President David Mabuza provided the key- note address. Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies and Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu also took part in the conference. The issue that came up most during engagement sessions was the lack of business funding and support from financial institutions for small and medium-sized businesses. Mabuza said: “We need serious intervention on this, because it shows that our people are not lazy, but lack the necessary support.” He said aspiring business people and the government needed to work together. That would make sure that radical economic transformation was put into practise. He said financial support services in the private sector needed to be linked with the government to guarantee that small businesses in rural areas and kasis were developed. Mabuza said those economies relied on government initiatives, which meant that they needed to be prioritised. He also said government needed to make sure the progress of small businesses was not delayed.
