RESIDENTS will now have access to the internet, thanks to the Nkangala Municipality. It launched a free Wi-Fi platform on Friday. The free Wi-Fi is powered by Nashua Mpumalanga and each user will get 250 MB free every month. Mayor Thembi Masilela said this will help bridge the digital gap in the district and will create a digital highway into the future. She said it will help in terms of employment and to google information. Masilela said information will be accessible to everyone in the district and will empower all. “Information is a big game changer and we are going to use technology to empower everyone. This will make lives better as we embrace growth and change. Kids will be able to do their school work with ease and everyone in the district will be able to access important information.” “People must use the free Wi-Fi wisely as a tool that will take us far. Together with Nashua we are creating a digital highway for the citizens of the district. “This high-speed internet connection will positively impact on service delivery, for instance government information and systems will become more accessible,” she said. Nashua Mpumalanga representative Steve Anderson said it was very important to be associated with key clients. “South African consumers pay high prices for internet access. Wi-Fi is a cost effective way to deliver it and will expand freedom of expression online. “It will also supply the software needed to give the amount of data required. Extra data will be paid for and vouchers will be sold to public by vendors,” he said. Nkangala municipal manager Margaret Sikhosana said there will be hot spots all over the district in public places like community halls, schools, clinics, libraries and malls.
