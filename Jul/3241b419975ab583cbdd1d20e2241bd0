ZAfro jazz legend Oliver “ Tuku” Mtukudzi hinted recently that his upcoming album will be his last. After giving a brilliant performance at the Ugu Arts Jazz Festival in Port Shepstone, KZN, on Saturday, the self-taught singer and guitarist with more than 50 albums under his belt announced that he’s set to retire . Tuku, aged 66, said: “I want to rest.” He said all he wanted was to enjoy and spend the remaining years of his life at home. Tuku, one of Africa’s most famous and admired musicians, promised his many fans his last album will be the best of them all. “I will put my heart into it. My fans still like and believe in my music,” he said. “I’m planning to bless them with the best album before the end of the year. I think it will be last one. “I’ve been in the music industry for a long time. It’s time for me to call it a day.” The Neria hitmaker last released an album, his 56th, in 2015. He started his music career in 1975, aged 23. Event organiser Siyabonga Msomi said he was happy with performances given by the artists but he was disappointed at the low turnout.
