THERE are 57.7 million people in Mzansi and 7.52m are living with HIV. However, the number of AIDS related deaths has decreased
from 276.921 in 2007 to 115.167 in 2018. The mid-year population statistics released by the Statistics
South Africa estimates that black African population is in the majority with
46,7m and constitutes approximately 81% of the total South African population. The white population
is estimated at 4.5m, the coloured population at 5,1m and the Indian/Asian
population at 1.4m. Just over 51% (29,5
million) of the population is female. Statistician-General of South Africa Risenga Maluleke on
Monday released the 2018 mid-year population estimates, providing estimates on
the population of South Africa and includes current indicators of fertility,
mortality and migration. He said people living with HIV in 2018 are estimated to be
sitting at 7.52m. Said Maluleke: "Of course we are looking at people in
South Africa living a lot more healthier. With the proliferation and
availability of ARVs, there are more people living with HIV, so it’s not a
question of the numbers just increasing." He said  17 million of
the total population is aged 0-14 years , 35.8m are youth and adults between the
ages 15 and 59, whereas 4.9m is the elderly aged between 60 and above. Maluleke said women live longer than men in Mzansi with a
life expectancy of 67.3 years compared to 61.1 years for males. 51% of the South African population is female. Statistics also reveal that the total fertility rate in
South Africa continues to decline. More urbanised provinces have a lower fertility rate.
