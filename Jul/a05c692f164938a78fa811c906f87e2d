KIDS queued for a free chiskop at Thembokuhle Primary School in Godlwayo Village in Pongola, northern KZN, on Saturday. The Chiskop Mahala initiative was put together by Njabulo Thwala (26), Bekezile Msane (27) and Nelisiwe Ndlangamandla (27). Njabulo said their aim was to show the community they could change lives, even with limited resources. “Kindness goes a long way,” Njabulo told Daily Sun. “When you give help to someone in need, you uplift and encourage them,” Ncamsile Shange (42), a parent, said: “We’re grateful, as the community of Pongola, for these youths’ good deeds.” Ncamsile said the Chiskop Mahala group’s aim was to be a positive, powerful example for younger people. Said Bekezile: “Giving back also has a profound, rippling effect. You never know. “Your single act of kindness could change lives in more ways than you possibly imagined.” In January, they approached several companies for help and Clicks donated four hair clippers. Bekezile said they still experienced financial difficulties, but that did not slow them down. In January they cut 150 kids’ hair! With the help of community members, the group successfully cut 205 kids’ hair in July. Njabulo said they planned to add games and career guidance to the list of their activities.
