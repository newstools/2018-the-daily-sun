 JUST as Tshiamo Manonyane’s mum thought he had changed his ways, the 18-year-old has gone back to nyaope!  On Tuesday Daily Sun published Tshiamo’s story about finding a new high from walking on stilts. He told the People’s Paper he was tired of hurting residents with his criminal deeds. His mum Dikeledi Manonyane (51) from Thaba Nchu, Free State was happy when her son stopped using drugs and left crime behind. But on Tuesday, she found her clothes and shoes were missing. She said Tshiamo stole them and sold them to buy nyaope and other drugs. “I wasn’t home over the weekend as I had gone to bury my mother. When I came back home, I found my clothes, shoes and other items missing. I later realised that Tshiamo was the one who had stolen the items from me. He also sold some of his things.” He has gone back to his bad ways and this is making me sick. He refused to tell where he sold the items. I went to the cops just to scare him, but it did not work.”She said Tshiamo asked to be taken to rehab so he can stop using. “I don’t have the money to send him but I want my son to be well. I no longer trust him enough to leave him in the house alone.” “My son is very talented as a stilt walker but he angers me when he steals to get drugs.” Tshiamo said he needs help to stop using drugs so he can make his mum and residents of his kasi proud.
