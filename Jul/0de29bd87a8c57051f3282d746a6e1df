THE man accused of killing Uyathandwa Stuurman (4) might not be able to stand trial because of mental illness. This was revealed in the Khayelitsha Magistrates Court in Cape Town yesterday morning. Andile Gamda (33) is accused of trying to rape the little girl from Makhaza before murdering her. Uyathandwa was playing at her grandfather’s house on Monday afternoon when she went missing. Her body was later found dumped in the veld. Prosecutor Andrew Edem said Gamda tried to rape Uyathandwa but couldn’t pull off the crime. “The accused allegedly went to borrow a knife from a neighbour to slit the victim’s throat. He then tried to hide her body in a dustbin,” he said. Gamda will undergo mental evaluation as doctors think he might not be stable. Uyathandwa’s father, Benjamin Mvula, couldn’t bear to go to court. “I don’t have the energy to face him. I want him dead! But that isn’t allowed so the law must make sure he stays in prison for life,” he said. The case was postponed to 23 August. Uyathandwa will be buried on Sunday.
