DON’T go out at night! That is the urgent warning from Nkosilathi Ndlovu (45) of Lusaka in Mamelodi East, Tshwane. When he went out into his dark kasi two weeks ago, he came face to face with five cruel thugs. The tin can collector paid dearly as he lost a tooth and his lips were almost cut off too. He said all they wanted was to make him ugly. He was attacked on his way back home after collecting empty cans from nearby taverns. “I don’t know how I survived.” Nkosilathi told Daily Sun he was robbed of his phone and R20 but the beating he received pained him most. “I don’t usually go out at night,” said the father of three, who was stabbed with a screwdriver in the lip and back. He said they wanted to strip him naked but he was saved because his clothes and shoes were too big for them. Nkosilathi said the smallest thug was the most cruel as he stabbed him several times, while the others kicked him. He said he was forced to stay in bed for two days after getting medication at Stanza Bopape Clinic. He said it was the first time he was robbed and has vowed never to walk in the dark again. “I’m still in pain and can’t eat meat because my teeth are painful and loose.” He told Daily Sun he’s still traumatised. He warned other residents not to walk at night and to run if they see men walking in a group. He also urged police to watch over Lusaka because thugs are turning the area into a lion’s den. Police spokesman Michael Mbewe said crime isn’t only a policing problem and people should report the crime in their back yards.
