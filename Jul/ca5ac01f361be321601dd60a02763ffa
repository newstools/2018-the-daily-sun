BLACK Leopards are on the verge of signing former Bidvest Wits defender Pentjie Zulu. Zulu has been training with Lidoda Duvha since last week and has impressed Leopards head coach Joel Masutha. A source told SunSport all that is left now is for the 28-year-old to agree on terms with the Leopards management. “He looks good and impressed Joel and his technical team,” said the source. “They will sign him before the end of this week. All that’s left is for him and management to agree on the contract. But he looks happy and wants to play for Leopards.” Added the source: “He is an experienced player who has been in the top flight for years. “Leopards defenders need his experience. The good thing is that age is still on his side.” The Bloemfontein-born player played for National First Division champions and newly promoted Absa Premiership side Highlands Park FC last season. The well-travelled Zulu has also played for Chippa United FC, Platinum Stars, Mthatha Bucks FC and Jomo Cosmos. Meanwhile, Masutha has not yet decided whether to sign former Orlando Pirates defender Ayanda Gcaba. The experience defender has been trying his luck at the Venda side since last week after Pirates did not renew his contract. Bucs loaned the 32-year-old to relegated Stars last season.
