COMMUTERS had to run for safety when the train they were travelling in caught fire on Saturday. Luckily, no injuries or deaths were reported. The incident happened at Booysens, south of Joburg. Lillian Mofokeng, a spokeswoman for Metrorail, said the train was travelling from Westgate to New Canada at about 3pm when it caught fire on the bridge near Crown Station. “Two plain trailers and one motor coach have been burnt completely,” she said. Firefighters rushed to the scene immediately and battled the raging fire for hours, while terrified commuters looked on. Mofokeng said the cause of the fire was still unknown, even though arson was suspected. “A board of inquiry will be appointed to determine the cause.” “The damage is estimated at about R10 million, but there will be a thorough assessment to determine the final cost.”
