BUSINESSMAN Ally Ahmed fears for his life and his two employees’ safety. The 28-year-old has been robbed twice in just two weeks. Ally told Daily Sun robbers attacked him while he was on his way to a taxi rank just over a week ago. Then on Thursday night, he and his employees were held hostage and stock worth R30 000 was stolen. Both incidents happened in Ga-Rapitsi Village, Limpopo, where Ally has a shop. He said he was planning to go back to India, his home, because he believed thugs were deliberately targeting him. Ally said he does have a security guard. “But when the thugs broke in they tied his hands before breaking the burglar doors and gaining entry,” he said. He said he was also robbed two years ago and later shot in the tummy after pointing out the suspects to cops. “I’ve been in this country for more than 10 years,” he said. “The gangsters are targeting my shop. They even know which time of the month I make more profit.” Captain Mamphaswa Seabi said a case of business robbery was opened at Matlala cop shop. No arrest has yet been made.
