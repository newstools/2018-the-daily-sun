If you’ve always had your eye on musician, Donald Moatshe then now would be the perfect time to strike. The singer and songwriter says he is ready for love and wants to settle down with the woman of his dreams. But, you have to possess a few qualities before you can be in the running. “I’m looking for a woman who is strong-willed, knows exactly what she wants, who is a go-getter. I’m looking for a woman who knows what she wants, who’s got big dreams. I don’t want a woman who is gonna look at me as a way out of anything and a woman who has her own mind,” Donald told DJ Fresh on a recent installment of the Fresh Breakfast on Metro FM. The singer was there to promote his new single, Sanctuary Love and so naturally, the topic of love in his personal life came up. “I am typically what people think I am through the music. I’m a huge romantic. At some point I thought I wasn’t because I was very angry at the person I was in love with and I thought this love thing was just a scam,” he said. But just because he is looking for love, doesn’t mean that he will go out of his way to make it happen. Donald said that love is everywhere around him and that it comes naturally to him. “I’m a guy full of a lot of love, I have a lot of love to give, all kinds of love,” he said. He also told the breakfast team that he is now at a point where he has learnt the difference between those who deserve his love and attention and those who don’t. He then went on to share that he has been single for year and a half now. “I’m not in a relationship with anyone, I need to put it out there. It’s a bit of a shame to me because I’m actually at that point in my life where I want to settle down with someone that I really love and adore,” he shared. “When the time is right, it’s gonna happen. I’m definitely the guy that wants to be married and have kids. I’m just waiting for the woman; I’m gonna cook for her, make sure she feels like a queen every single day,” he continued.
