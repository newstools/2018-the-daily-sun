AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD girl who was found dead outside a flat during a school trip will be buried on Saturday. Renae Mutheiwana from Sheshe Village, outside Nzhelele in Limpopo, was in the care of her teachers and SGB members when she died in Durban, KZN last week. It is not clear how Renae, a grade 2 pupil at Sheshe Primary School, died but it is believed she fell from the first floor. Her uncle, Nditsheni Nyamutambo, said the family was not satisfied with the explanation they got from the teachers and SGB members. “They all say they were cooking in the kitchen when they found Renae dead outside the flat. Why did the teachers leave all the kids alone and focus on food? “Everybody in the family is devastated and her mum is not taking it well. According to post mortem results, she suffered head injuries. This gave us the suspicion that she might have fallen.” Renae and 31 other pupils left their village last Tuesday for a two-week school trip to Durban. They were supposed to return tomorrow. Nyamutambo said the family had several meetings with the Limpopo Education Department, which would be assisting with burial costs. “We are currently preparing for her burial, and we are still asking for help from the public to bury her with dignity,” he said. Limpopo government spokesman Phuti Seloba said everyone in the provincial government learned of Renae’s death with sadness. He said the government had sent condolences to the family, pupils and teachers at the school. “The department will possibly be assisting the family with burial costs.”
