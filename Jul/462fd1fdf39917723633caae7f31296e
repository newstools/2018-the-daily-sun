Renowned South African media personality and entrepreneur DJ Sbu is all about hustling, but not at the expense of his brand. The 41 year-old has been in the entertainment industry for 17 years and during that time he has managed to build a solid brand for himself. Unfortunately, there will always be a few chancers who will attempt to capitalize on other people’s hard work, however, DJ Sbu is not having it. The TV and radio personality, whose real name is Sbusiso Leope, is taking legal action against scammers who used his brand on a false advertisement. “SCAM ALERT!!! Guys this is what I mean when I always say build your own brands before you end up desperate and doing such nonsense with other people's brands. We are taking legal action against these guys,” he revealed on social media. SCAM ALERT!!!
