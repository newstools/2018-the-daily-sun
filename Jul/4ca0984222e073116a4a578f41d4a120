After his big win at the BET Awards in Los Angeles last month, African trap star Sjava has been hot property ever since he stepped off the plane. He was given a hero’s welcome at OR Tambo International Airport last week as hundreds of fans came to show their appreciation to him for putting Mzansi on the map. Fans also came in their numbers to see him perform this past weekend at an event in the Vaal. Looking to catch a glimpse of the BET Award winning star, some fans let the excitement get the better of them leading to a stampede that left others hurt. Sjava, whose real name is Jabulani Hadebe, took to social media to thank his adoring fans for showing so much love and also took the opportunity to apologize to those who got hurt during the stampede. "I had a great time and sorry to everyone that got hurt coz of the stampede when I leave the house to go perform my plan is to make people happy, not for them to get hurt‚ therefore I am very sorry, I understand people show love but let's not hurt each other guys‚" he said.
