A GROUP of elderly people are calling on their relatives to prevent a tragedy from taking place. The gogos and madalas at Sister Angel Old Age Centre are begging their relatives to remove them from the place in Moloto Village near Kwamhlanga, Mpumalanga. An elderly woman (58) claimed she was raped repeatedly by one of the old men who lives at the centre. She claimed every time she reported the rapes to the owner of the centre, she was given abortion pills and a contraceptive injection. The elderly folks claimed the living conditions at the centre caused three deaths this year. They told the SunTeam they are often beaten, forced to bath in cold water and made to sit in the dining-room, which has no heater. Josephine Mokwana (55) has been living at the centre for four months. She said: “Our disability grant cards were taken so we don’t get a cent of the money. “We are forced to eat food that has expired and our cellphones were confiscated. “Our lives are at risk. “We are pleading for help” France Mkulwana (58) said although he has only been at the centre since November, he feels as if he has been there for more than 10 years. “Prison is much better than this place,” he said. “We only receive our medication once a week and there are no doctors who come to conduct checkups. “We want to leave.” Social development spokeswoman Petunia Lessing said officials visited the old age centre and discovered it wasn’t registered with the department. They also found out it doesn’t meet the department’s minimum standards. “The department will get all the relevant stakeholders, including the families, involved. “We want to close the centre and ensure the elders are placed somewhere appropriate,” she said. Angel Gamede, the owner of the centre, denied the allegations and refused to give further comment.
