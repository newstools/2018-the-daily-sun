FORMER president Jacob Zuma first lost his title as the country’s number one. And now he has lost someone dear to him. His son, Vusi Zuma (25), died on Sunday in the Milpark Hospital, Joburg. Zuma’s spokesman, Vukile Mathabela, told Daily Sun details surrounding his death will be revealed at a later stage. Vusi was the youngest of five children. Two of his siblings are the twins Duduzane and Duduzile. Their mum, Kate Mantsho, committed suicide 18 years ago. In her tweet, former private secretary to Nelson Mandela, Zelda la Grange, wrote: “This is terrible. Vusi was a beautiful child. We saw him grow up. He went to Sacred Heart in JHB. “ Just wondered about him the other day.” American activist Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr, also took to Twitter to express his condolences. “Sending prayers for and condolences to former SA president Jacob Zuma and family on the loss of their son, Vusi.” President Cyril Ramaphosa added: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Zuma family at this time. “May their son’s soul rest in eternal peace.”
