R&B singer and 2015 winner of Idols South Africa, Karabo Mogane is once again wearing his heart on his sleeve for all to see. The crooner released his brand new single, Nginothando this past week, ahead of his third studio album. The song is a ballad that speaks about love, Karabo’s signature theme. Produced by legendary hit-maker, Godfrey ‘Guffy’ Pilane, Nginothando is Karabo’s first single in almost two years. The easy-going and singalong ballad takes fans on a journey of love and paints a mosaic about love in all its colours and shades. “I’m delighted and overjoyed with the sound and how everything came together when I worked with Guffy, whom I respect so much, in the studio. I have no doubt that music lovers will appreciate the craftsmanship and the elements that make Nginothando so special,” said Karabo. Nginothando is available on all music platforms including Itunes, Deezer, Google Music, Spotify, and Tidal.
