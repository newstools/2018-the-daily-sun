BABES Wodumo’s PR team and bodyguard made sure she didn’t reveal anything about her private life. The gqom queen, whose real name is Bongekile Simelane, was at the Adidas shop launch. She and Proteas bowler Andile Phehlukwayo, as well as AmaZulu midfielder Michael Morton, were invited to the launch at the Gateway mall in Umhlanga, Durban, on Thursday. She arrived flanked by her bodyguard and spokeswoman Hlengiwe Mlambo. Babes was the centre of attention and the bodyguard allowed fans to take selfies with her. SunBuzz asked her about rumours she and ex-fiance Mampintsha were back together. But Hlengiwe jumped to her defence. “Please don’t ask her anything with regard to her private life. We won’t leave her with you because we’re afraid you’ll cross the line. Ask her only about this event. It’s our job to protect her image,” she said. Babes said she was excited to be a part of the event and to receive love from her fans. “This is the best moment for me and I’m happy that people received me with excitement,” she said. Adidas publicist Kelebogile Shomang said they invited Babes because she was young and appealed to their brand.
