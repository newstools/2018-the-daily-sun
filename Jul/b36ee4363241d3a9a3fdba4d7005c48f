PHILLIP Thokolo wants husbands and wives to be happy. The 52-year-old from Ga-Molete in Senwabarwana, Limpopo, is a dancer, singer and composer. Phillip started out as a gospel musician, but after seeing how much domestic abuse there was in Mzansi he switched to singing wedding songs. “I have tailor-made songs for brides and grooms,” he said. “Most of the people at whose weddings I performed are still together.” He said he was leading by example and had a healthy marriage. “I’ve been married to my wife Johanna for 15 years, and we’ve been together for 34 years,” said the father of three. Phillip said the secret to their successful marriage was respect, tolerance and dealing with unexpected problems together. He said his first wedding album was called Rabaki. In 2010, he released Basadi Ba Mzansi, which was addressed to mums who gamble with their children’s grants. Phillip is working on a new album, Mekgolokwane, and plans to release it in December. “Two singles have been released. Malau a Moshate features Basadi Ba Sengatane and was written for Chief Matolo Khalo,” he said. “He gave it the thumbs up after I performed for him at the royal house.” When he isn’t performing at weddings, he sings and dances at malls. His will perform at Steilloop Plaza on Saturday.
