A MALAWIAN pastor has been arrested after being accused
of making false promises to a woman to con her out of her money. According to Nyasa
Times, Abraham Abusisiya (31) of Hope Ministry was taken in by cops on
Wednesday after a complaint was laid by Loveness Paulo (49). Cop spokesman Edward Kabango said: “The pastor told the
complainant, Loveness Paulo, who is a teacher at Dzenza Community Day Secondary
School in Dedza, that he received a communication from the church’s headquarters
in the USA to identify and send people who are able to speak English to the USA
for a holiday. “Then the pastor told the woman that she was chosen as
she knows how to speak English and he started demanding cash.” Abusisiya said he needed the cash to pay for her visa and
air ticket to America. From 2015, bit by bit Loveness handed money over to the
pastor, hoping that one day he’ll make her dream of going to visit America come
true. By 2018, Abusisiya had allegedly scammed K1,4 million
(about R25 500) off Loveness before she became gatvol and laid a complaint of
theft by trickery with the cops. Abusisiya is being held in custody until he appears in
court, said the report.
