HE WAS a respected man of the cloth who spoke out against evil every Sunday and didn’t touch alcohol or dagga. But pastor Pilamado Makaneta ended up being killed for a zol in his home at the weekend! The 54-year-old man was attacked by thugs who entered his house in New Eersterust, Tshwane, and demanded that he sell them dagga. The heartless thugs shot and killed the pastor from the Church of Christ in front of his family after he started arguing with them. His death left his mum, Annah, devastated and according to the family, she has not said a word since her son died. The pastor’s mother-in-law, Martha Mokgaga, said he was celebrating the fact that his 16-year-old son had done well at school when armed thugs forced their way into the house. “They told him they knew he sold dagga,” she said. Gogo Martha said Pilamado told the thugs three times that he didn’t even like dagga but they wouldn’t listen. “They forced the members of the family into a room while they searched the house,” she said. “When they didn’t find anything, they threatened to torch his car. He started fighting with them and they shot him. They took a laptop and cellphones and fled.” Temba police spokeswoman Captain Sarah Lesabane said cases of house robbery and murder were being investigated. “No arrests have been made,” she said.
