FEZEKA Jonas believes that her mamazala is trying to ruin her life! The 40-year-old from Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, told Daily Sun her mother-in-law organised a makhwapheni for her 44-year-old husband, Xolile. Fezeka said she and her mamazala, Nompikiso Jonas (65), were friends before she got married in 2008. Things changed, however, when her husband refused to hold their wedding at her house in Motherwell, and insisted it take place at his grandparents’ home in KwaZakhele. “Since then, my mamazala has been criticising everything I do. She keeps on reminding me that I do not bring anything to the table,” she said. “In 2016 I heard that my husband had been sleeping with my neighbour at his mum’s house, but I dismissed the rumour. Then, after he had slept away from home a number of times, I decided to visit his mum’s home. “I found him in bed with his makhwapheni. My mamazala was also there.” Fezeka said when she confronted her husband and his mum, her mamazala told her not to put a foot in her house again. “The two then moved in together. My husband’s new lover is now controlling his money and he does not support me any more.” Xolile said he and Fezeka had problems and he was giving her space. “When the time is right, we will resolve our issues as husband and wife,” he said. Nompikiso denied organising a lover for her son. “I would not break up my son’s marriage. Fezeka has problems. She served me with a protection order and that is why I chased her out of my house.”
