SUNDAYS are the best days for Tshegofatso Maphuthi for two reasons – it’s the Lord’s day and she also enjoys her seven colours meal. But it seems local nyaope boys have also discovered her passion for good cooking. On Sunday they struck again, this time stealing her delicious meal and her pots too! The 31-year-old mum from Bochabela in Mangaung said she finished cooking some rice, chicken, pumpkin,coleslaw and potato salad. She said she dashed to the shops for some cool drink. “And when she returned, she found the lock on the door broken and all her pots gone, along with her food. Tshegofatso said her problem started last month. “After I had finished cooking, I placed the food in Tupperware containers and left for church. “When I came back, my containers and the food were gone. “I didn’t think it would happen again,” Tshegofatso told Daily Sun. “I don’t know why thugs targeted me. I’m not the only person who cooks Sunday seven colours meals in my kasi. “I once gave a nyaope boy food. Maybe he’s the one who told them about my food and now they want more. “If they came to ask for food I would have gave them some. They shouldn’t steal it. “I’m asking the thugs to bring back my pots. I didn’t open a case but I will pray for these thugs to be punished.”
