LAND invaders vandalised Gugulethu Fire Station, burnt cars and damaged municipal offices yesterday morning. The residents invaded a vacant piece of land in the area more than a month ago. Xolelwa Halom, a member of the Ramaphosa squatter camp residents committee, said: “The owner gave us seven days to vacate his land. “We gave the City of Cape Town two hours to meet the owner and talk about purchasing the land.” Committee member Bheki Shumana said the owner is willing to sell his land to the City. “But the City refuses to buy it,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said a public violence case was opened after the fire station was attacked at about 4.30am yesterday. “About 150 people threw stones at the station and burned a vehicle. “One fireman was hit in the face,” he said. He said police were called to disperse the crowd. No arrests have been made yet. Safety and security MMC Jean-Pierre Smith said the damage caused by the invaders could amount to as much as R1 million. “The protesters also targeted Fezeka Municipality’s offices behind the fire station,” he said. “They torched four vehicles and a storeroom at the local electricity depot. The station is closed and our firefighters will be based at Mitchells Plain.” Smith said the City will not tolerate the destruction of property. “We call on members of the public with information about the incident to contact the police or the City’s public emergency communication centre.”
