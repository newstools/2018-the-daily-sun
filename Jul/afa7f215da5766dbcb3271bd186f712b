Local TV and radio personality, Relebogile Mabotja has exposed a fan who made a very awkward request of her. The 702 host has posted screenshots of a DM conversation between her and the fan who asked her for money. The unidentified fan asked the star for money to help him move to America to pursue his dreams because South Africa just isn’t for him. “Me and my two friends [want to] go to America; our families don’t have money to pay for plane tickets to America. So we need someone who can give us money to buy plane tickets and money to pay for school fees and for apartment etc. In exchange we’ll make sure we thank we thank you in every possible way,” the fan said. Relebogile was just as confused as the rest of us by this reach, she just had to screenshot the messages and show everyone the madness that happens in her DMs. “This is my inbox daily...So many young people want everything but are not willing to do a damn thing for it... No CV. No details. No motivation. No formality. Just words on dreams...what they are I don’t know... Don’t do this kids...” she ranted on her timeline. “People think that when you go overseas you automatically find success&wealth.Please know, you can also be broke and a hobo in Paris. In America...anywhere. And there you won’t have family that can bail you out with a roof & a meal... If you are struggling now here?!!” she continued.
