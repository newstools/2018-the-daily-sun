VUYISILE Simamane (21) is a relieved mum. Police found her three-month-old baby boy alive on Thursday. Baby Luyanda went missing on 2 June while Vuyisile was sleeping with him at her home in Umthwalume, on the KZN South Coast. She alleged that a cousin stole her baby after he and his girlfriend visited her home for about two weeks. They apparently left on the same day that her baby went missing. “I’m excited that the police have found my baby alive. My son has been missing for a month and I was not myself during that time,” she said. “I was even admitted to hospital due to high blood pressure, which was caused by severe stress.” Luyanda has not been reunited with his mother yet. Police found him in a bad state and took him for a medical examination. Vuyisile said she wanted the cousin to rot in jail for what he’d allegedly done. “What he’s done to me is painful. He’s made my life a living hell and I couldn’t sleep,” she said. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the Port Shepstone family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit followed up on information about the whereabouts of the missing baby. “They went to a house in Lamontville in Durban, where the baby was found. “A 21-year-old suspect, who is related to the mother, was arrested at V section in Umlazi. He appeared in the Umzumbe Magistrates Court for kidnapping on Friday.” He’s expected to appear again today. “The police are still searching for his girlfriend,” he said.
