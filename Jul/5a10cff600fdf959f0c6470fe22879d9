WHEN Bennett Xavarere saw toyi toying protesters start to loot stalls, he tried to flee with his chickens. However, the 45-year-old vendor wasn’t fast enough because his stock was on a heavy trolley and the looters at Bekkersdal Taxi Rank in Rand West City took 10 of his 18 chickens. Bennett just stood and watched as protesters helped themselves to his chickens after threatening him with violence. The devastated father of two couldn’t contain himself. He just broke down in tears. He told the SunTeam he had lost stock worth R800. “I will pray hard for those who stole my chickens to pay for what they did. I can’t work this hard for somebody to just come and take my things. I spent a lot of money on this stock and this means I’m not going to gain any profit,” he said. I won’t take this lying down. I want to teach them a lesson so they stay away from other people’s things tomorrow.” The SunTeam saw protesters marching off with Bennett’s chickens. After seeing what was going on, other vendors started running away with their stock. Nolufefe Mkhaya, one of the vendors, said: “These people are evil. We are trying to put food on the table for our kids and they just come and take it.” Residents of DX section in Bekkersdal were demanding electricity. They told Daily Sun the municipality had promised to electrify all the shacks in the area but they were overlooked. Municipal spokesman Tshidiso Tlharipe urged people to be patient. He said the electrification process had started in nearby Zenzele squatter camp.
