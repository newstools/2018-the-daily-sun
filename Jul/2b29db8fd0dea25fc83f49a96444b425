THE flames rose high into the air and an unmistakable smell filled the air. The residents of Angelo squatter camp in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni set fire to some of the toilets in their kasi with kak inside! The angry residents said they hoped the foul smell would reach the noses of officials far away and help them change their minds. Cops and officials from the municipality had to cover their noses as the stench was too much to bear. As the fires died down, some danced and sang on, but for others stark reality set in as they realised they had no place to relieve themselves. The residents told Daily Sun that they had been complaining to the municipality to stop sending them bucket toilets. They said the municipality sometimes took too long to empty the buckets. Others mentioned the unhygienic methods of the municipal workers. “When they come to take out the buckets, they spill kak all over and we have to walk over it. Our kids end up getting sick. We know we live in a squatter camp but that doesn’t mean we should be treated like animals,” said one resident. The cops intervened and stopped the residents from torching more toilets. A contractor sent a truck to remove the remaining toilets. Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said torching the toilets was not a solution. “We have an open door policy and people are welcome to air their grievances.”
