RESIDENTS of Cape Town breathed a sigh of relief last week when it was announced that dam levels had increased to 42%. But three kasis in Strand have nothing to celebrate. Asanda Village, Nomzamo and Lwandle have been experiencing unannounced interruptions to their water supply. Residents say it has been happening for over a week. “We wake up and there is no water,” said Zandile Hati (24). Nomapha Kalolo (27) said the situation is frustrating. “The municipality does not have the decency to tell us what is happening. They just cut the water off at random,” she said. Councillor Simthembile Mfecane said he does not know why the water supply is so erratic. “I asked other councillors and they said they were also in the dark. I don’t know what to tell the residents.” Cape Town water services MMC Xanthea Limberg said the residents were warned about the cuts. “This is part of the City’s drought response programme, which is happening across the metro,” she said. “The City regrets any inconvenience but this is needed to ensure we survive the drought.” She said inspections have been completed and the kasis’ water supply has been restored.
