Nelson Mandela Day shouldn’t only be just a one day event. This is according to Njabulo Mathe, the chairman of the Millennium 2000 organisation. The organisation, together with cops from Bhekithemba Police Station, put on overalls and cleaned the station in Umlazi, south of Durban on Saturday. Mathe said it was his organisation’s way of celebrating Tata’s legacy. He said they would continue to do good things in his name because they believed Tata’s legacy should be celebrated every day. “Our organisation helps people, not only on Mandela Day. “We feel Madiba must be honoured every day which was why we went to clean the station over the weekend,” said Mathe He said the organisation started as a stokvel, which was founded by men from Umlazi’s BB, AA and Z sections. They said the group has grown a lot since then and now has members from all over the kasi. He said the organisation also donated food parcels and uniform to needy families and orphans. Station commander Colonel Shiyebona Khubisa said it was important for cops to have good relationships with people in the community. “We thank the organisation for assisting us to clean the station. “We appreciated that because police stations are community centres where people must get services. “As police, we always say our work to fight crime and maintain order in our communities depends on our relationship with society.” Khubisa said they meet regularly with the organisation to discuss problems in the areas. Brigadier Vukani Mgobhozi, Outer South cluster commander, also helped to clean the station.
