BLACK game farmers in the Free State have received a helping hand. In her budget vote earlier this year, the MEC for economic, small business development, tourism and environmental affairs promised to donate wildlife to them. This promise is slowly becoming a reality as the wildlife economy transformation programme workshop was held last Tuesday. MEC Limakatso Mahasa said: “Forty-five black emerging game farmers were invited to the workshop ahead of the donation of game to qualifying farmers.” Mahasa said they were informed about how animals are selected and how to handle them. “While national game donation policy guidelines are still being developed, the department aims to fast track the donation process by updating the existing policy, which has been in place since 2007,” said Mahasa. The animals which will be donated include springbok, eland, zebras, ostriches, buffalo, kudu, red hartebeest and blue wildebeest. Some 33 applicants were screened to determine their suitability, as well as the size of their property for inclusion in the game donation programme. Of the 33 applicants, 28 qualified for the programme, six of whom were women. The next step will be to hand over the game to the selected applicants.
