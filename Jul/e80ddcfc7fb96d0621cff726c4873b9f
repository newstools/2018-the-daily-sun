THE family of three-year-old Omari Monono believes he was killed before being thrown into a pit toilet. The family from Ditenteng Village in Moletjie, Limpopo says Omari went missing on Tuesday. They searched for him in the same toilet he was found but he was not there at the time. Omari, who lived with his aunt Matlou Moholola (53), asked to play with his friends after she helped him relieve himself behind the toilet. Matlou believes his killer threw his corpse into the toilet to make it look like an accident. “We searched for him when we realised he hadn’t returned home,” she said. “Residents helped us look for him. “The police searched the pit toilet but he was not there. “Why was he found the following day? “This is foul play. “That boy was killed. “When he left the house he was wearing clothes, but his trousers were missing when they removed his body from the toilet.” Chuene Monono (26), Omari’s other aunt, said they are shocked by the little boy’s death. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba said he was deeply saddened by the tragedy and warned parents and guardians to be alert at all times. Police spokeswoman Constable Maphure Manamela said an inquest docket was opened.
