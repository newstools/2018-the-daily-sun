A TEACHER accused of burning three pupils with boiling water last year was shown the gate after she reported for duty when schools re-opened on Tuesday. When the incident happened in October last year at Thembalethu Primary School in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, parents wanted the teacher to leave the school immediately. But the principal convinced them not to disrupt lessons as it was close to exams. “We listened but came back in January to make sure the teacher had left. But to our surprise, she was still there,” said parent Carol Mbonani (46). She said parents had put pressure on the principal until the teacher was suspended in May. “But we were surprised when the suspension lasted only two months.” “She poured boiling water on the kids because they were playing in the passage she had told them to keep away from. “My son was lucky because he was wearing two jerseys and the water couldn’t reach his skin. But one of the boys was seriously burnt,” claimed Mbonani. Marks Ramasike from the National Governers Association, said: “As a member of the school governing body, I’m concerned about the well-being of the pupils. Her action was far from disciplining the pupils.” Steve Mabona, a spokesman for Gauteng Education Department, said: “We can confirm the protest by parents at the school. “But the situation has been resolved amicably and pupils are back at school.”
