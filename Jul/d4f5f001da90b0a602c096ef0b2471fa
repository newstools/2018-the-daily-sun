IT SEEMS a solution for the project to install water pipes in the north of Durban is far from being reached. This is despite the recent protests by angry residents and local business people, when they stopped the project from continuing. The residents had demanded that the eThekwini Municipality make them part of the project. On Friday the members of the Project Monitoring Committee went to the municipality’s water department offices in Durban. They asked for a meeting with the head of water and sanitation. They said they went there because they had heard the project was continuing, even though they had stopped it last month. Apparently the municipality gave the instruction for the project to continue. The committee said they were shocked and wanted to know why the municipality had taken that decision. They said according to municipal policy, residents would be hired and business people would be given a 30% share of the labour and construction when projects such as those came into the area. Londiwe Makhanya, chairwoman of the committee, said they asked the municipality to follow the right procedures so that the project could continue. “The municipality did not listen to us and they told the contractors to continue working. “We have tried to discuss the matter with them, but they don’t want to listen.” She said on Friday they went to the office and demanded to speak to the head of water, but he was not available. “We were told that he will be available on Tuesday. “We will come back on Tuesday because we want this matter to be discussed and resolved. “Apparently there are funds that went missing. “This must also be investigated,” Londiwe told Daily Sun. Since Friday the People’s Paper has been battling to get comment from the municipal spokesman, Mandla Nsele. Nsele was even sent WhatsApp messages, but he did not respond. He once told Daily Sun he could not answer calls or respond to inquiries over weekends.
