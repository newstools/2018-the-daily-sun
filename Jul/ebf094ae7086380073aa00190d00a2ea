THE new PSL season will kick off with the 2017-18 Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns taking on Kaizer Chiefs at Loftus Versfeld next Saturday. This clash has all the makings to be a spectacular start to the season, while the league’s title sponsor will also showcase to fans what it means to “Bring Your Voice” by staging a one-a-the-kind opening ceremony for the domestic league competition. After this grand start, the Woza Nazo fixtures for the new season begin in earnest, with matches that will reach fans in all corners of the country to bring even more excitement to the biggest league on the continent – in what has been dubbed Africanacity. Absa has also launched its new logo that will be used going forward.
