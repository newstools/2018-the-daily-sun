WHILE some kasi residents look down on people with tattoos, Sello Shabangu believes body art is a form of expression. The 28-year-old tattoo artist from Winterveld, north of Tshwane runs Skhalo the Ink Guru tattoo parlour at Mabopane Station. “I realised my artistic abilities when I was in grade 4. My job has always felt like a hobby,” he said. Sello said although he could not afford to further his studies after high school, he is happy with the way his life turned out. “My heart feels like it is going to explode with happiness every time I realise how far I’ve come.” Sello said people get tattoos for different reasons. “Some people, especially women, do it to make a statement. “Others do it to voice their opinions while some get tattooed because they think it’s fun.” He has a book with more than 300 samples of designs that customers can choose from. Sello said he is always shocked when a customer asks him to tattoo their private parts. “I take that as a challenge a it’s part of my job. But I always act professionally.” He said he wants to take budding tattoo artists under his wing. Lindi Sibanyoni, one of Sello’s customers, said: “Tattoos are a form of self-expression. “They tell people who you are and what you care about. That’s why I love my tattoos.”
