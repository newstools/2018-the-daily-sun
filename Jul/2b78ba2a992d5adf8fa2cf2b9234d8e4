SHE prayed for help from President Cyril Ramaphosa but help arrived from an unexpected place! Gogo Mamosala Pii (80) received a visit from Chinese businessmen last Wednesday after her story appeared in the People’s Paper. She was showered with gifts of groceries, blankets, a paraffin stove, a heater and pots. Gogo, one of the oldest residents of the Chris Hani kasi in Mangaung, is the only one who doesn’t have an RDP. She cooks outside because there is no electricity in her two-roomed house. She lives with her two grandchildren and her daughter. Daily Sun published her story on 20 March with the headline “I’m happy Zuma’s gone” after he was voted out. Jimmy Shi, chairman of the Free State Fujian Overseas Chinese Association, said he was touched by her story. “We had to do something for her. We hope she’ll be happy and warm this cold winter. For the past 20 years, South Africa and China have had a good relationship.” Gogo thanked Shi and Daily Sun. “I’ve run out of words except to say thank you very much. I’m already feeling the love and warmth from the blanket that comes from you. I’m now hoping to get my RDP house.” Senne Bogatsu, Free State Human Settlements spokeswoman, advised the gogo to apply for a new RDP from the municipality.
