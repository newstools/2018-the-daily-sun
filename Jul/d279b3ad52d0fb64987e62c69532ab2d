ALTHOUGH he’s only 11, Kano Motolong spins the decks like a pro. The boy from Mahikeng, North West, told Daily Sun his older brother used to play music to him on his laptop. “I started watching videos of real DJs and imitated them until my uncle decided to teach me how to do it properly,” he said. The house and gqom DJ is in grade 6, and when he isn’t studying he plays music and learns from his uncle and mentor. The young DJ has been making waves as he has been playing for big crowds in his area. His mum Neo (44) said she wanted him to focus on schoolwork. “It makes me happy that he’s doing what he loves and enjoys it, but he needs to finish school,” she said. Kano told the SunTeam his favourite DJs were Prince Kaybee and DJ Shimza. He said although he loved music, he wanted to become an electrical engineer when he grew up. His uncle Modise Lumka said: “When he comes to learn, he has prepared music. He has an ear for good music.” DJ and radio presenter Papa Naledi said he discovered Kano. “His mum sent me videos of him playing for a big crowd and my business partner Boogy Man and I decided to adopt him.”
