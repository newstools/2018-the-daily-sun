THE Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) NEC says they will host a
march for the suspension of fuel price taxes and the escalating costs of
living in South Africa. IFP National Spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa said their position
is clear, as they call for the suspension of the fuel levies, until the economic
situation in South Africa improves. Hlengwa said the ANC government appears to be fiddling
its thumbs in taking any strong action against the suspension of fuel levies. He said they wrote to the Speaker of Parliament Baleka
Mbete, requesting for a debate on the rise in fuel costs and the effect it would
have on the South African public. Hlengwa said, the
Speaker of Parliament outright refused to deem the matter as one of national
importance. “Therefore all IFP structures will participate in protest
action to highlight the plight of millions of South Africans,” Hlengwa said. According to Hlengwa, an overhaul in pricing adjustments
is required to offer people a better deal. “In this regard, the IFP will launch a National Petition
to mobilise South Africans and our structures in calling on government to take
action. Enough is simply enough – Our people are in desperate
need of leadership and strong intervention from the national government,” He
added.
