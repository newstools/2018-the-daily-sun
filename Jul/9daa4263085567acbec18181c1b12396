THE DA, ahead of public hearings on land in KZN next week, said yesterday in Durban it would back a decision for the Ingonyama Trust to remain under the Zulu king’s control. But only if Zwelithini allowed his people to have title deeds. Parliament’s constitutional review committee is travelling across the country to hear citizens’ views on proposed amendments to Section 25 of the Constitution. Provincial party leader Zwakele Mncwango was accompanied by MP Ken Robertson, a member of the portfolio committee on rural development and land reform. Mncwango said his party supported Zwelithini’s fight to keep land under the trust.  But it also wanted rural people to have their share. “We support the Ingonyama Trust because we don’t want land to be taken by the State,” he told Daily Sun. “The DA wants the land to be given to the people, which is why the trust must be adjusted to allow residents to have title deeds.” Meanwhile, KZN House of Traditional Leaders chairman Phathisizwe Chiliza said the issue of title deeds in rural areas was up for discussion. But there had to be some form of security to protect poor people from having their land taken by financial institutions, he said.
