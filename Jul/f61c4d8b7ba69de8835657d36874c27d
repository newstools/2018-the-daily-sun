TSHWANE artist Hendrick Chauke has been the talk of the town for many years. Drivers stop to stare at his unusual statues. From his replica police helicopter and lookalike 4x4 cop van to a statue of a larger-than-life police officer standing next to the bakkie, the 30-year-old has almost built an entire crime force all by himself. His amazing art is his way of saying thank you to the police who once saved his life. But the artist from Dilopye Village in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, told Daily Sun he had no plans of stopping there. He’s now working on a new project – a full working car that he plans to name The Mandela! Hendrick said the car would be the first of its kind to be built by hand and by a black person, and that he wanted to name it after the late president Nelson Mandela. “I want to be the first African to build his own car. I have been working on it and by November, it will be ready and on the road,” he said. “We are free because of Madiba. My car is going to be the first African car made in Africa by an African.” Hendricks also makes small police vans that he sells for toys and ornaments. His dream is to open his own art gallery but said he didn’t yet have the means to do that yet.
