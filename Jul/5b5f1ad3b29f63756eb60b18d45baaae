THE LEGENDARY BMW E30 is one of the most celebrated car the German automobile manufacturer has ever produced. So, what do you do? If you live in the South Western Townships (SOWETO) and whatever model of BMW gives to a hassle. You leave in the capable hands of Bongani “Topia” Vilakazi ofcourse, the proud owner of Topia Motor Engineering Services. Car’lture decided to pay a visit to Topia and see what he’s all about. When we arrived he was busy on with a customer’s Mini Cooper, and the way he talks about his love for German machine’s shows he’s a petrol head at heart. “I know that BMW’s are a kasi vehicle, everyone who grew up in Soweto loves a BMW.” “We specialise in BMW’s and we even registered a company called Topia Motor Engineering Services,” Topia said. Topia walked us through an E30 that was recently done by them, he said the car was completely restored from scratch. “We did the body, changed the colour, and refurbished the engine to a 2.9l, we changed the pistons and conrods of the engine. We used a 328i crankshaft from an E36 BMW 3-series, and we also fitted a new exhaust system,” Topia said.
