Actor and Maskandi artist, Mlungisi Mathe has unveiled a new look. Mlungisi has tossed out his old average high-top fade hair cut for braids at the top and a fade cut at the bottom. The Skeem Saam actor took to Instagram to show off his new hairdo. The video also shows that Mlungisi, also known as Skandi Kid is not the only one with the new locks. Seems like his whole squad is going for a boy-band feel with the same hairstyle. Check it out below: Ayihlome!!!!! Team no filter????.. letâ€™s meet in news cafe!!
