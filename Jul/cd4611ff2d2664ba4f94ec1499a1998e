Two men were killed and 13 others injuredÂ  following a head-on collision between a taxi and bakkie on the Elias
Motsoaledi Road in Soweto on Thursday morning. ER24 paramedics along with other services, arrived on the
scene to find a taxi parked on the side of the road while the bakkie was found
parked on the opposite side. "Upon closer inspection, paramedics found that two men had
sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing
could be done for them and they were declared dead. "Thirteen other patients were found and assessed on the
scene. Six were found to have sustained critical injuries while seven others
had sustained minor to moderate injuries," said ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring. Paramedics treated the patients and provided the
critically injured with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, one
of the critically injured patients was airlifted to a nearby hospital by the
ER24 Oneplan Helicopter. The remaining patients were transported by ambulance
to nearby hospitals for further treatment. Local authorities were on the scene for further
investigations.
