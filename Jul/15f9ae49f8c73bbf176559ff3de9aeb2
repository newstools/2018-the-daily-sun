WHEN Meshack Mahlangu crawled from under a 4x4 bakkie, he believed his ancestors were not ready for him. The 55-year-old madala from Wonderhoek near Somaphepha Village in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun he wanted justice after being assaulted by a mlungu who lived nearby. Meshack said the fight started in December when the mlungu showed him a hole in the fence, claiming his cows had made it. “He called me in December, saying my cows had torn the fence apart,” said Meshack. “When I told him it was impossible, he became aggressive and threatened to kill me. “I couldn’t believe it when he took out a knife and stabbed me in the arm. “I was bleeding a lot but he pursued me, telling me he wanted to finish me off. “He then got into his bakkie and attempted to run me over. I tried to duck but he drove towards me. “I was surprised to find myself under the bakkie. I don’t know how I managed to crawl out from under the car. “What surprised me was that he went to open a case of assault against me while he was the one who wanted to kill me.” He said the case was thrown out of court in May due to insufficient evidence. “We will be going to court again as I also opened a case of attempted murder against him.” Police spokeswoman Captain Khanyisile Zwane said a case of attempted murder was opened and the matter would be heard in the Middelburg Magistrates Court on 24 July.
