The IFP’s decision to appoint Mkhuleko Hlengwa as its new national spokesman was a calculated move. According to Professor Bheki Mngomezulu, Hlengwa (32), is being groomed for a more senior position in the party. Mngomezulu is a political analyst at the University of the Western Cape. Speaking to Daily Sun before jetting out to Kenya on Monday, Mngomezulu said the IFP was under substantial pressure because it has been accused of giving positions to madalas. Hlengwa was officially appointed the national spokesman earlier this month. Mngomezulu said since the political landscape has changed in the country, all parties are giving senior and influential positions to young people. “The IFP couldn’t afford to resist this change,” he said. “I believe the party is preparing him to take over a more senior position in the near future. “He has a bright future in the party.” Mngomezulu added that the IFP wanted someone to match youthful leaders like Julius Malema, Mmusi Maimane and ANC elections head Fikile Mbalula. But Hlengwa dismissed this, saying: “The party wanted a competent candidate to do the job, and I was the chosen one.” He said he was humbled by his appointment, and promised not to disappoint. Velenkosini Hlabisa, who is expected to take over the reins from long-standing party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, said Hlengwa was appointed on merit and not as a result of pressure. He said Hlengwa became South Africa’s youngest MP when he was sworn in by the then National Assembly Speaker Max Sisulu in 2012. He serves on two portfolio committees – economic development, and sport and recreation. Hlengwa doubles as the national youth wing leader of the party. He is the son of the late inkosi Mhlabunzima Hlengwa from Mfume, south of Durban. His dad was also a loyal IFP member and served in the KZN legislature as deputy speaker. He died in 2005.
