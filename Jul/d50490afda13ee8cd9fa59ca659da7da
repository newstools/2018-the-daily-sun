ALL seven people who died in a car accident on their way to a church service on Saturday were Zimbabweans. They were members of the African Apostolic Church and were on their way from Ga-Thoka in Mankweng to Kgapane, outside Tzaneen in Limpopo. A puncture saw their white Toyota Venture rolling several times and killing six people instantly. The driver, Bruce Sithole (27) died on Sunday morning at Mankweng Hospital. He had suffered head injuries. Among the dead were three children – Blessing Makhunyaane (4) and Alfred (3) and Memory Mazuru (1) – as well as church pastor Willington Revanewako, Sophia Pankware and Clara Makhunyaane. The Venture, which can carry a maximum of 10 passenger, was overloaded with 17 passengers, including the driver, when the accident happened near Ga-Makgoba Village on the R81. Willington Mutero, a church representative, said they were still shocked. “We are left in disbelief and pain that we lost six of our members at once. “We normally hire taxis from around here when we have a church trip, but since we know Bruce we decided to use him. We don’t want to blame anyone,” he said. Bruce’s uncle, Benjamin Murhawa (41) said Bruce didn’t want to transport the church members as he was still busy with his building commitments and they hadn’t told him in time. “But they begged him until he agreed. “We are left heartbroken by his passing. He leaves behind his wife. He was a kind man and loved people,” he said. All the dad will be buried in Zimbabwe as soon as post mortem investigations were concluded, Limpopo police spokesman, Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said.
