Luzuko Nteleko said no amount of money will convince him to stop acting. The 32-year-old said he started acting after taking a train trip to Joburg. “After I completed my matric, I didn’t know what to do with my life,” he said. Luzuko studied at Wits, but ended up dropping out for financial reasons. “But I didn’t want to sit at home and do nothing,” he said. His trip to Joburg led him to Windybrow Theatre in Hillbrow. Although he has a background in gumboot dancing, he told scouts at the theatre he wanted to be an actor. “They took me in after I auditioned,” he said. Luzuko’s big break came when he was cast in a British documentary series called Zero Hour. His next big opportunity came when he was cast as Loyiso in the SABC1 drama Zone 14. “I enjoyed being on the show because I was doing two things I love: playing soccer and acting.” He also acted in SABC2 dramas Streets of Mangaung and Mamello. Luzuko is now a cast member in the political drama Ambition and said educating viewers is part of his job. “Acting is about more than just portraying people’s lives. It’s also about teaching them.” The talented actor is also a DJ and a businessman. Luzuko, who runs an events company called Dotty Moments, said his decision to DJ was born out of necessity. “Hiring DJs for events can be expensive, so I decided to take a break from acting to focus on improving my skills behind the decks.”
