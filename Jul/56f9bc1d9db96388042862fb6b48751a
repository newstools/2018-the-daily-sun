A mUM of two was left homeless after her shack burned down at Jika Joe squatter camp on Friday. Zanele Macubeni (35) was one of about 70 people who lost their belongings after about 20 shacks caught fire in the area in Pietermaritzburg, KZN Midlands. The cause of the fire is still unknown. “Some people said the fire was started by whoonga addicts. Others said it started after a stove was left on. We really don’t know what the cause was,” said Zanele. She told Daily Sun the fire, which started at about 10am, spread quickly and she couldn’t salvage her belongings. “I’m a trader and I had R3 000 in my cupboard to buy stock. That money is now gone. I’m left with nothing,” she said. “My ID and everything I had were reduced to ashes. The boots I’m wearing were lent to me by a neighbour.” Another resident, Sphelele Buthelezi (27), said: “Most of the shacks were made out of plastic, wood and cardboard. When there’s a fire, it’s difficult to control it.” Some were in shock when they returned to the area to find their homes destroyed. Ward 33 councillor Nkululeko Mkhize said: “The Msunduzi Municipality’s disaster management has provided relief in the form of tents, blankets and food parcels. “We expect more assistance from businesses and NGOs in the coming days.”
