WORKING as a construction company labourer meant earning a lousy R250 a week. For proud father of four Khetani Mathevula (51), of Matiyani Village in Limpopo, it was a bitter pill to swallow. He told Daily Sun: “I was always worried and didn’t know how we’d survive. “I struggled to support my wife and kids with the little money I earned each week. “So I decided to quit my job and taught myself to make wooden spoons. “It took me a month to master the skill. “After completing my training, I started my own business.” Today, Khetani makes different types of wooden spoons and sells them in villages. “I started by making only 10 spoons per day. But in 30 minutes, villagers bought them like hot cakes. “Now I make about 150 a day!” said Khetani, who sells his products door to door in villages like Mhinga, Josefa, Salema, Xikundu and Malamulele. Khetani charges between R10 and R160 for them, depending on their size. “I make over R5 000 a month and when business is slow, I still make R3 000.” “My dream is to get my company registered and create jobs for my fellow villagers who are unemployed.”
