AT age 92, gogo Ntombiyenkosi Mathaba shouldn’t have to worry about where her four grandkids will live when she dies. It should be the other way round. Ntombiyenkosi and her grandkids, aged between 10 and 15, live in a rundown mud house in Nqutshini Village in Empangeni, northern KZN. She told Daily Sun the house was built by her late kids more than 20 years ago. “Two rooms have collapsed due to heavy rains over the years,” said the gogo. “We’re left with only two rooms. I’m worried who my grandkids will turn to once I’m dead.” She said they all relied on her pension grant. “We rely on my pension for groceries and other basic needs such as school uniforms and clothes,” she said. She said her grandkids weren’t getting grants as they didn’t have birth certificates. She said she was unable to walk properly and, as a result, villagers had to push her around the village in a wheelbarrow when she went to collect her grant money. Ward councillor Prince Mathenjwa said: “We still haven’t found a Good Samaritan to help build her a house. “In 2013, I added her name to the list of residents who require houses urgently, and we’re still waiting.”
