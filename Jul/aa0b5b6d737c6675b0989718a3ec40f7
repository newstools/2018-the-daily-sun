THE Ubuntu Bethu organisation aims to restore kindness and dignity to Samora Machel residents in Cape Town by helping people with disabilities. Founder Mzikayise Ndzuzo said it was started in 2005. “Our organisation deals with the community,” Mzikayise said. “We visit disabled people and wash them and clean the houses where they live. We also do their washing,” he said. As they were going around the area, they saw people who needed wheelchairs and walkers. After asking the councillor for help, they got two wheelchairs and two walkers. “To some people this might look like a small thing, but to us it’s huge because we had nothing before,” he said. Supervisor Wendy Khonco said they will share one to help those who need it and the other was given to 30-year-old Sibusiso Menze, who cannot walk. “We need more wheelchairs because a lot of people need them. “But for now we will use the one to help all of those who need it until we get another donation.” Nomzamo Menze (52) said she is so happy about the wheelchair donation for her nephew Sibusiso. “I am crying because I’m so happy. “Sibusiso used to be a street kid and slept under a bridge. “He was in hospital for two years and we didn’t know where he was.” She also said that when they found him in hospital, he was disabled and unable to talk. “We don’t know what happened to him because he was born normal, like any other child but now can’t walk or talk.” Nomzamo used to struggle when she had to take Sibusiso to hospital because they had to pay for transport. ‘We will be saving a lot of money now because I will just push him in this wheelchair. “We will forever be grateful to the people who made this donation possible.” Councillor Thulani Stemela, who donated the wheelchairs, said their job is to help the community. “The most important thing is to give our people their dignity back and we hope to do exactly that,” said Stemela.
