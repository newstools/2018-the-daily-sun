BORED kids have made a graveyard their own playground, upsetting residents. Morena Khoapi (42), who lives across from the graveyard in Stofland in De Doorns, Western Cape, said they had been trying to tell the kids to respect the dead, but with no success. “We have been chasing them away every time we see them playing on the graves, but they do not listen,” he said. Morena said he was very confused when he heard the kids talking about their horses at the graveyard. “When I asked them what they meant, they took me to the graves, which they refer to as ‘horses’. I was hurt because they stand on top of the graves,” he said. Nyameka Phindzi (37) said the only thing that would make the kids stop playing in the graveyard was a fence. Residents also complained that criminals use the graveyard at night. They said thugs lay on top of the graves so that people could not see them as they were walking past. Ntlakanipho Hlanganani (30) said the municipality had already placed stones to prevent cars from driving into the graveyard, but it needed to also put up a fence to keep the kids out. When the SunTeam asked people living next to the graveyard whether they ever saw anything strange, they said they sometimes saw lights. They said they had no idea what the lights were. Breede Valley municipal spokesman Johann Botha said: “Provision was not made for fencing in the budget. “Fencing will be identified as a priority during the public engagement process in September.”
