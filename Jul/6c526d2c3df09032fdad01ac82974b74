PULANE Sefuthi is a worried mother. The 55-year-old from Braamfischerville, Soweto is looking for her son, Sithembiso (25). She said her son is a nyaope addict and has been missing for three months. “Sithembiso disappeared soon after stealing his brother’s sound system to feed his nyaope addiction.” Pulane said she didn’t care that her son was an addict, she just wanted him to come back home. “I can’t turn my back on my son just because he is an addict. I will send him to rehab so he could get his life back on track. “It’s winter and I’m worried about if he is warm, wherever he is.” Pulane said when she first discovered her son was smoking nyaope, she was in denial. “I kept on defending him when people alerted me. Even though at times he was showing signs of smoking nyaope, I convinced myself that my son was not a drug addict. But then things started missing from the house.” Pulane said people also started coming to her house looking for Sithembiso because he had stolen from them. “Every month I had tod replace the things he stole from my neighbours.” She said Sithembiso was once bust for stealing from his gogo’s house. “But I’m pleading with my son to come back home.”
