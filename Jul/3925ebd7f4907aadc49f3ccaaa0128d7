AMAJITA have qualified for the 2019 Africa Under-20 Cup of nations following their 2-0 victory over Malawi on Saturday afternoon. The third round, second leg qualifying match took place at Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre. Having fired blanks in their first leg encounter with the Junior Flames at the Moruleng Stadium in Rustenburg last weekend, Amajita managed to turn things around in the second leg scoring two goals that came from Kobamelo Kodisang in the first half and Thabiso Monyane sealed the deal with his late strike in the 84th minute. Amajita experienced players which includ the likes of Kodisang, Khulekani Kubheka, Nkosingphile Ngcobo and Wiseman Meyiwa played a vital role to ensure Amajita qualify for the tournament. The international youth tournament will be held in Niger from 24 February to 10 March next year and the top four nations will automatically qualify for the Under-20 Fifa World which will be played later on the same year in Poland. Amajita now joins the likes of SA Under-17 Womens team (Abantwana) who have also qualified for Womenâ€™s Under-17 World Cup. Senior womens team Banyana Banyana also qualified for Afcon which will be taking place later this year. It remains to be seen if Amajimbo (under-17) will be able to follow in the same footsteps by qualifying for Afcon.
