TRACKER agencies could soon be getting calls to trace property that belongs to the dead! Tombstone business owner Xolani Ndwalane (28) is the brains behind the brilliant idea to hide a tiny tracking device in a tombstone. Thugs will now have to think twice before cleaning out the cemetery as the stolen tombstones will lead cops straight to them. As an added bonus, the clever device will also help loved ones find the graves of their dead relatives if they have forgotten their grave numbers. The owner of Kgotso Lesedi Tombstones from KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun: “South Africans are tired of disrespectful tombstone thieves. I want to ensure tombstone thieves never win.” Xolani started his business in February last year after seeing several families left saddened by the theft of their loved ones’ tombstones. With help from a friend, they figured out a way to find these tombstones and stop the theft. “This is not just about thieves. Due to the high number of graves in graveyards, it sometimes becomes difficult for people to find the graves of their loved ones.” Prices of tombstones that include the device start from R5 000. “I place the device inside the tombstone so that it’s not easy to spot,” he said. “Now, just like with a car, thieves won’t even know where the device is.” Xolani said they also offered a sandblasting option for families that couldn’t afford the device. “Deep sandblasting also makes it difficult for criminals to remove the print,” said Xolani. He encouraged people to check their loved ones’ graves frequently. “Keep visiting your families and clean their graves,” he said. “That will also show the thieves that you visit often and they stand no chance.”
