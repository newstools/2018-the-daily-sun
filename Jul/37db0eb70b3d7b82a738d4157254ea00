A MAN has been bust for allegedly selling drugs. On Wednesday night, cops raided a flat in Berea, Durban that was apparently rented by a Tanzania man (36). Police recovered drugs with a street value of about R600 000. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said members of the provincial drug unit received a tip-off. “When cops arrived at the flat, the drugs were about to be mixed, packaged and distributed. “The total value of the recovered drugs is about R600 000,” said Gwala. She said that further investigations revealed that the flat was being used as a drug lab. Gwala told Daily Sun the suspect was expected to appear in the Durban Magistrates Court today. “The suspect will face charges of manufacturing and dealing in drugs,” said Gwala. In a separate incident yesterday, a 31-year-old Nigerian man was arrested for supplying drugs in Pinetown. Gwala said that the man was found in possession of drugs with a street value of about R29 000. The suspect was charged with the possession of drugs and will appear in court soon. A Pinetown resident (46) said most foreigners in the Durban CBD were known for dealing in drugs. “It’s a good thing that cops are finally taking action against them. “Drugs are a problem in society and they ruin our kids’ lives. “Perhaps the arrest will make a difference in our area and send a strong message to drug dealers. “I hope cops will continue flushing out drugs in our communities,” said the resident.
