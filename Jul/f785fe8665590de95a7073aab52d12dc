The start of the 2018/2019 Premier Soccer League is just around the corner and teams have been busy in the transfer market trying to strengthen their squads. While there is still a fair amount of time left before the 1 month long transfer window shuts, teams are not wasting any time securing their top targets. Mamelodi Sundowns secured the services of Andile Jali from Belgian outfit KV Oostende last month, beating Soweto giants Orlando Pirates and Kazier Chiefs to his signature. Kaizer Chiefs then moved swiftly to secure arguably the biggest signing so far in Khama Billiat, who joined the Glamour Boys from Sundowns on a free transfer a few weeks later. Meanwhile, Orlando Pirates also made their intentions for the upcoming season very clear when they announced 9 signings last month, the standout being goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo who came directly from their arch rivals Kaizer Chiefs. Some of the smaller teams have also been busy in the market. Polokwane City announced 7 new signings last week among them former Maritzburg United and Free State Stars striker Mohammed Anas.
