WHEN a fire destroyed Nomthanthandzo Gamandze’s shack weeks ago, little did she know her tears would soon be wiped away. After everything burnt to ashes, Nomthanthandzo, from Matsulu in Mpumalanga, will now get a new house that she and her seven-year-old daughter can call home. She told Daily Sun she still doesn’t know what caused the fire that ended up destroying everything she had worked for. The 43-year-old fruit and vegetable hawker has been without a home for over 10 weeks. She said on 1 May, she was greeted by flames and smoke all over her shack. Bystanders were watching her house burn. “I woke up that morning and went to town where I work. I was surprised when I came back later to find my shack in flames,” Nomthanthandzo said. She said what worries her most is that no one saw what happened and until today, no one has been arrested. “Instead, people stole some of the burnt things and I don’t know who it was.” “I’m just glad one of the neighbours offered me a place to stay with my daughter and I’m excited and grateful that a new house will be built for us.” Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said a case was opened but no suspect has been identified. She said since July is the month in which former president Nelson Mandela is celebrated, the police and Hawks in Mpumalanga, with Mbombela Municipality, Silulumanzi and others will build Nomthanthandzo a house. A donation to help the family will also be made on Mandela Day next week.
