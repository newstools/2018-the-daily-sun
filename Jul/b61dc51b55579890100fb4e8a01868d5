HE used to be a fearless hitman who got the job done! Then he was bust for hijacking a car and served nine months in jail. Unlike many other thugs who do not change their evil ways, Simphiwe Mahlangu (34) from Mabopane stepped out of prison a changed man. But he doesn’t have peace. He claims that his former friends want him dead. While in jail, he decided to come clean about one of their dirty jobs. He called a man they were supposed to kill in 2014 and asked for forgiveness. “Three of my friends and I were hired to kill that man, but we couldn’t find him, so we burnt his truck.” Simphiwe said his friends were arrested after he testified, which made them angry. “When I got out of jail, they sent people to harass me. They beat me up and said I should stop testifying,” he said. He said he even moved from his home because they might kill him in his sleep. He said he also fears for his children’s safety. “Even though they haven’t done anything to them, I still fear that they might hurt them in future,” he said. He said he didn’t report the matter to the police because he is afraid they might not help him because of his past. Loate police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola advised Simphiwe to report the matter to the police. “He must tell them everything that has happened and they will investigate.”
