Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Willard Katsande has claimed that he played a role in convincing Khama Billiat to join the club from South African champions Mamelodi Sundowns. Katsande and Billiat are both Zimbabwean, but played on opposing sides in South Africa for seven years after Katsande left Ajax Cape Town to join Amakhosi. After a highly successful five-year stint at Sundowns, Billiat shocked the country by signing for Kaizer Chiefs last month. Katsande has revealed that he played a part in luring his compatriot to Naturena. "I can say I helped the team get him," said Katsande, according to Kick Off. "But we know what kind of player Khama is. He has come to The Village and changed the whole dimension of the players around him." Likening the impact Billiat has on the team to that which Neymar and Ronaldo have on theirs, Katsande then went into detail on what he told the winger about Chiefs. "Obviously, as a brother, I wanted him to be here [at Chiefs]. I know how it is to be here, I've been here for eight seasons and they've been good to me," Katsande explained. "I even told him, 'You know what, there's no place like Kaizer Chiefs. Just come here baby, you won't regret to be with us.'" Billiat scored eight goals in 16 Premiership appearances for Sundowns in their 2017/18 title-winning campaign, securing his third league title at the club. He will now be looking to help Amakhosi knock them off their perch. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
