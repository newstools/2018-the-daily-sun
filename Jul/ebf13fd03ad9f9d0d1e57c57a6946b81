South African star Nakhane “hungs out” with the legend on his Rocket Hour show which aired yesterday. When Sir Elton John is around, it is perfectly normal for those around him to gush in adulation. But what happens when the roles are reversed and the five-time Grammy Award winning musician geeks out over you? That surreal moment happened to the London-based South African singer recently when a certain Sir Elton John requested a FaceTime interview. Every week Elton John puts together an eclectic mix of "music you know, music you don’t know and music you should know” for his hour long internet radio program on Beats 1. In over 150 episodes, Rocket Hour has featured music from and interviews with superstars including Sam Smith, Tom Misch, George Ezra, Childish Gambino, Khalid, Kesha, Kygo and Years & Years. Beats 1 is a worldwide, 24/7 music internet radio station hosted on Apple Music. In his latest episode, Elton John called Nakhane via FaceTime to talk about Nakhane’s latest album ‘You Will Not Die’, his influences, and his favourite songs. Earlier this month, Elton was presented with Nakhane’s music, which he enjoyed so much that he played his latest single, “Interloper” during the show. “My mother had an Elton John ‘Love Songs’ compilation that I listened to a lot as a child. Never did I think that one day I would be FaceTiming him. It is absurd - in the best possible way, of course. This unsolicited kindness and support is so appreciated,” said Nakhane, who is also set to play the Paris and Brooklyn legs of the iconic AFROPUNK Festival in July and August. Nakhane has accumulated quite a following since his sophomore album, You Will Not Die - the follow-up to the groundbreaking Brave Confusion, was released earlier this year. All this has seen him make several European TV appearances, including Later… with Jools Holland, while also booking festivals in support of the album.
