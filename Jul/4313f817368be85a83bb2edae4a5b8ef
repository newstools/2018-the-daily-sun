THE woman allegedly earning R50 000 a month as eThekwini mayor’s helper is formally employed by the expanded public works programme. Staff on the programme mainly work as cleaners and are apparently paid a rate of R130 a day. In a written response to Daily Sun, the municipality confirmed Thabisile Ncayiyane (36) was employed by the programme. Municipal spokesman Mandla Nsele said staff with the programme were paid for work performed, which was aligned to the municipality’s pay scale. Daily Sun published an article about the matter last week, after the office of the mayor, Zandile Gumede, denied Ncayiyane was the mayor’s helper. The office said she didn’t even work there. Ncayiyane denied being employed by the mayor’s office or earning R50 000 a month but refused to say which section of the municipality she was employed by. Nsele said corruption concerning ghost employees in the programme has been investigated and officials linked to it were being subjected to disciplinary processes. “The recovery of funds will take place after the verdict,” said Nsele. A senior official with the integrity committee investigation unit said Ncayiyane’s name was on the list of ghost employees.  He said he didn’t know how she ended up in the mayor’s office. She was supposed to be working as a cleaner in terms of the public works programme. Although Nsele didn’t give the names of officials linked to corruption, the SunTeam has learned there are three officials accused of employing ghost workers and sharing their salaries. It’s believed the municipality employed 71 ghost workers. When the SunTeam approached Ncayiyane with the allegations yesterday, she said she wouldn’t answer any questions until the media gave her the reports which apparently named her.
