Apartheid-era police officer Joao Rodriguez is expected to appear in court on Monday for the murder of anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol. Rodriguez is due to appear at the Joburg Magistrates Court on charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice after he turned himself over to police at the Joburg Central Cop Shop. An inquest in 1972 ruled that Timol’s death was suicide by jumping out of the window on the 10th floor. During the inquest set to investigate Timol’s death last year, Rodrigues said that Timol jumped out of the window. He was told, however, by Judge Billy Mothle that he was a liar. Timol’s family has always firmly believed that Timol was killed by the apartheid police.
