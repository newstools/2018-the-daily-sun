Tyres are a critical but expensive requirement for any vehicle. Keep a vehicle’s tyres in the best condition to ensure the occupants are safe. Here are some tyre safety tips. - Keep all tyres, including the spare, inflated to the manufacturer’s recommended tyre pressure. This saves petrol and keeps tyres from wearing out too early. - Inflate tyres with nitrogen to keep them properly pressurised for longer. Nitrogen makes tyres run up to 20% cooler and they last longer as well. - To get tyres to wear down at the same rate, rotate, balance and align them every 10 000km or as recommended in your vehicle owner’s manual. - Clean your tyres and not just the sidewall, to make them look good. Use soap and water to remove foreign substances that might cause the rubber to degrade faster. - Inspect them monthly. A visual inspection will reveal if they are wearing unevenly and allow you to get preventative maintenance done which should extend their lifespan.
