It seems as though there is already beef brewing between the two Gqom ladies, Babes Wodumo and TDK Macassette. The two songstresses recently released Gqom tracks with the same song title and they have been getting a lot mixed reactions. One fan even tweeted that they thought Babes Wodumo was supporting TDK Macassette when they saw her post about Domoroza but it was her own song and it's very dissapointing. On Saturday DJ Tira tweeted the two ladies album arts with the caption "#Domoroza is now trending in Durban" as the two ladies are both from Durban. These two talented and both attractive ladies left fans confused as to what is happening. TDK Macassete's management said they knew nothing about Babes Wodumo naming her song the same as TDK Macassette. TDK Macassette recently accused DJ Maphorisa of stealing the song  Nayi Le Walk, and that the world renowned DJ, producer and serial hitmaker who has released big songs like Midnight starring, Ngempela and Particular among other big hits stole it. She told Sunday Sun that Gqom is from KwaZulu-Natal. "It’s ours, Babes Wodumo is a gqom queen, DJ Tira is a gqom king. Where have you ever seen a gqom king from Pretoria?“He must stop calling himself a gqom king.” Could this also be the case? We tried to contact Babes Wodumo but her phone rang unanswered.
