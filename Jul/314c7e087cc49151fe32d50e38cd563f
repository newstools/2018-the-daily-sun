They went on to post screenshots of texts they have been sending Mampintsha regarding the debt, to which Mampintsha did not reply. The duo’s manager Sphamandla “Spha” Gumede said the money owed to them was just over 15 million rand. "We're talking about millions... so, yoh! This is deep,” he told YFM’s DJ Sabby and Tshepi, “I'm even with one of the gents right now and he doesn't even want to talk because he is so upset," said Gumede. He also revealed that the next step for the duo would be to take Mampintsha to court. Ntando Duma is also said to be owed by Mampintsha for her contribution to another one of Babes Wodumo’s hit singles Jaiva Phezkombhede.
