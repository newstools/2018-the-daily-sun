PAPI Papi realised school children needed activities to keep them out of trouble during school holidays. He knew children who are left unattended at home are at risk of being kidnapped, raped or led astray. So he decided to start a Winter School Boot Camp. Papi Papi (50), from Katlehong in Ekurhuleni, runs a programme called Nathi Mashisho Winter School. Speaking to Daily Sun, he said the programme has been operating since 1996. “This project takes children who are in grade 7 from poor homes. “The camp programmes prepare the kids mentally for high school. Papi said the programme also included workshops by political parties such as the EFF, the ANC and the DA. “We also expose the children to organisations they didn’t know existed,” he said. The programme runs for 15 days. The camp is currently being held at Vumbeni Primary School in Katlehong. “We set up the camp at schools because the kids can’t afford to go to camp sites,” Papi said. “We came up with the idea for the kids to stay in one place and keep them busy,” said Papi. “This is our first week. We have two more weeks to go. We call on the community to support us because these children come from poor families,” Papi said.
