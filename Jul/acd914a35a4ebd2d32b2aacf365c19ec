A poacher was shot and injured by cops in Hoedspruit outside
Phalaborwa. Cops say this follows an arrest of twelve suspects for poaching
and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition in three separate operations. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said four
suspects between the ages of 23 and 44 were arrested for poaching at a farm in
the Hoedspruit. Ngoepe said the police received a tip-off about the
existence of a group of illegal poachers in one of the local farms. “They reacted swiftly, spotted these criminals and arrested
two of them immediately and they were found in possession of unlicensed firearm
and ammunition,” Ngoepe said. According to Ngoepe, initial police investigations led to
the arrest of another suspect who was driving a get-away car, after he was
spotted in the same farm. “The police tried to stop him but he did not cooperate and in
process, he was shot and injured and then taken to hospital for medical attention,”
Ngoepe said. He said another driver of the second get-away car managed to
evade arrest by abandoning the vehicle and fled on foot and the police are
still looking for him. Ngoepe urged anyone with information that can assist the police
to contact Captain Cobra Moriri on 083 381 4313 or the Crime Nine sms 32211.
