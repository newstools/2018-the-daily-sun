THE KZN ANC’s elective conference was finally held at the weekend, but it appears the bloodshed in the province is far from over. One of the delegates was shot and killed in Umlazi, south of Durban, on Saturday. Bongani Mkhize (25), deputy branch chairman of ward 88, was attacked by two unidentified suspects. A witness said the attackers, who were armed with knives, claimed Mkhize owed them R500. The witness said he offered to settle Mkhize’s debt, but the attackers refused. The man said Mkhize ran to his car to fetch his firearm but the suspects took it from him. “We saw everything. It was painful to see our friend dying in front of us but there was nothing we could do,” said the witness. Branch secretary Sibusiso Maphumulo said he believes money had nothing to do with the attack. He suspects it was politically motivated. He said Mkhize left the conference in the early hours of Saturday morning and planned to return later that day. Maphumulo, who is also a ward councillor, said he was aware that some people weren’t happy when they were elected in 2016. Mkhize was also the chairman of the ANC Youth League at Umlazi Coastal TVET College. His cousin Philani Mkhize (33) said the family doesn’t believe he was killed for money. Police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said a 29-year-old man handed himself over to police and is expected to appear in the Umlazi Magistrates Court today. Naicker said the suspect was charged with murder and illegal possession of a firearm.
