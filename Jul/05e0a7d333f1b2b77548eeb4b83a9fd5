EVIL thugs attacked an elderly couple in the middle of the night on Saturday. They tried to rob them of their grant money. Philemon Sethokga (68) was lucky to escape with his life as his wife Janet (66) managed to raise the alarm. He was assaulted with a steel bar. It was the second time that the elderly couple has faced such horror. The madala and gogo from Ga-Mochemi Village outside Bochum, Limpopo said they lived in fear that they would one day be killed for their grant money. The couple received their grant on Monday, 18 June and four days later criminals broke into their house. It was in the middle of the night. The couple said last year criminals also robbed them of R17 000 that they had saved up to extend their house and install a fence for security. The madala said he didn’t hear the two criminals when they broke in. He was woken up by hot klaps as the thugs launched an attack on him, demanding money. “They wanted me to show them a safe for the money, but I refused because it’s not the first time they have come to my house and robbed us,” he said. His wife, Janet, said: “They fled when they saw that I had managed to get out of the house and was calling for help.” Headman Godfrey Malema said residents were angry and pleaded with police to arrest the suspects. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Senwabarwana police arrested a 22-year-old suspect on Saturday in connection with a case of attempted robbery. The suspect will appear in the Bochum Magistrates Court soon.
