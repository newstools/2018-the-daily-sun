WHEN Tony Ndlovu met Selina Mzalwane three months ago, he had finally found the woman he wanted to spend his life with. But then a mysterious illness suddenly gave her stomach cramps, and to Tony’s horror, Selina died at their place in Troyeville, Joburg last Saturday. Tony told Daily Sun: “We recently moved in together and then Selina suddenly fell ill. “We were planning to visit her family in Eastern Cape. “It is unfortunate that Selina died before we could go to her family. “I have tried to reach all her friends in Joburg, but no one knows where she came from, or any of her relatives for that matter.” Captain Richard Mun- yayi of Jeppe Police Station urged people who might have information about Selina’s family to help the police get in touch with them. “An inquest docket has been opened for investigation and the corpse is still at the government mortuary as no one from her family has been found. “Selina is believed to be from Port Elizabeth in Eastern Cape. “We are appealing to anyone who might know her family or relatives to contact the investigating officer, Detective Warrant Officer Matsobane Maja, on 072 296 2827 or 011 624 6021,” said Munyayi.
