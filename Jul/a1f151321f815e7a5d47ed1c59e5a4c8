DEFENCE force members, in partnership with Goal supermarket, used their Madiba 67 minutes to renovate an RDP. The good deed took place in Makhaza, in Khayelitsha near Cape Town, on Wednesday. “In the past we did something different. We’re happy to help out,” said Lieutenant Thusani Moyo. The store’s marketing manager Lwando Dandala said they’d identified four rooms that needed to be renovated. “Each and every year we do this, giving back to the community that has been supporting us through the years, and we’re also doing it for Madiba,” he said. He said they were not picky and helped both customers and locals. “Even though we’re doing this to follow in the footsteps of Mandela, we called the project Home Makeover,” he said. He said they’d learnt from the late former president that helping out was a good thing. Dandala told Daily Sun that, apart from the house in Makhaza, they would renovate two more RDPs in Philippi and Mfuleni. Bukelwa Zweni, the lucky resident, was happy and sad at the same time. She said they didn’t have privacy because their house wasn’t partitioned. “These people knew my mum, who was buried last week, and she didn’t live long enough to see the renovated house,” said Bukelwa (30). She was referring to the supermarket, staff. Bukelwa said the house became flooded in the rainy season and they often had to stay up all night, trying to scoop the water out. “This will change our lives. My mum is no more, but I’m sure she’s happy wherever she is,” she said. “She left us with something that we’ll cherish for the rest of our lives.” She had the Mandela Month spirit to thank for rescuing her family from their dreadful circumstances.
