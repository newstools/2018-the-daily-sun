THE rainfall in Nelson Mandela Bay over the weekend made little impact on dam levels. Officials monitoring the drought in the municipality warned residents that much more rain was needed for things to return to normal. The rain came following stricter water restrictions introduced last week and news that dam levels were at just 19,27%. Residents are not allowed to consume more than 15 kilolitres per water metre, building contractors have to use treated waste water, car washes have to recycle 60% of water and automatic urinal flushing systems are not allowed to be used. Mayor Athol Trollip said: “The full impact the rain has had on dam levels will only be known once the water moves through catchment areas into the dams, which can take up to three days. “While this rain brings some relief, it by no means reduces the severity of the drought crisis facing our metro and neighbouring municipalities of the Sarah Baartman district.” However, he said the rain did reduce the irrigation needs of fruit farmers in neighbouring areas, which was important for the province’s economy. “Every drop of rain counts and every drop of water conserved protects each and every one of us,” he said. “We must conserve every drop of available water by restricting personal daily usage to below 50l each. If we continue to be water wise, our taps will not run dry. “Report all water leaks to 0800 205050.”
