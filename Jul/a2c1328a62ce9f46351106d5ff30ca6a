OLYMPIC gold medallist Luvo Manyonga visited the National Netball Championships yesterday before he jets off to the inaugural Athletics World Cup in London. Manyonga inspired the women who are currently battling it out for honours at the 2018 championships in Port Elizabeth, also applauding Netball South Africa (NSA) for bringing the games back to the people. The long jumper threw his weight behind the NSA’s bid to host the 2023 World Cup and expressed confidence in Mzansi’s capacity to host the 16-team tournament. “It’s so exciting to have the national championships in PE. I’m a netball fan,” said Manyonga. “It’s great for the province to have tourists coming in to boost our economy. But it’s greater for the sport, as it allows many women to participate in the tournament.” Manyonga could become an unofficial ambassador of sorts for the SA bid as he travels the world to compete in various competitions. As one of the most recognisable faces in world athletics, he can spread the word far and wide. “I support the World Cup coming here. South Africa is one of the best countries to host major tournaments,” he said. The 27-year-old is excited to be going back to London, where he was crowned champion at the IAAF World Championships last year. The World Cup, a team-based international athletics competition, takes place this weekend. “It is a new thing. But we are going there to show the world SA didn’t achieve a top five finish by luck,” he said. Manyonga will then compete in the Diamond League’s London leg and completes his season with the African Championships.
