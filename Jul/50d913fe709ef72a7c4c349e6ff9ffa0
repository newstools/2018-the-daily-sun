THERE was ululation, clapping and ivosho dancing at Ntshingeni Senior Primary School when 21 new toilets were installed last week. It was part of a 67 minute initiative to remember Tata Mandela at the school in Cofimvaba, just outside Queenstown. The toilets were donated by Amalooloo. Previously, pupils at the school used an open field to relieve themselves. Teachers had to use overflowing pit toilets built in 1980s outside the school. Project co-ordinator Seka Mopeli said when they heard about the situation at the school, they decided to step in. He said he visited the school in May and saw pupils using the bush. “What I saw was really not good. “Even the teachers’ toilets were in bad condition. They risked disease because the toilets were dirty. “The chances of a teacher or kids falling into a toilet were very high,” he said. He said the company believes in promoting healthy living and investing in young people. Even though the new toilets don’t flush as there are no drains in the village, pupils and teachers said they were perfect. One pupil said when they saw the new toilets at their school, they couldn’t help dancing.“We saw the toilets on Tuesday when we came back from the holidays but teachers did not allow us to use them. “Today we were told to use them and they are so comfortable. They have toilet paper and soap to wash our hands.” SGB chairwoman Nolesson Sithetho said the whole school is over the moon. She even joined some of the pupils who were dancing next to the new toilets. Parent Sithembele Ngxukula said his son had to use the same old toilets he used when he was at the school. Life Orientation teacher Mkhosana Mabalela said since he arrived in 1990, he only went to the toilets once because of their bad condition.“They were far from the school and teachers had to accompany each other because they ran the risk of rape and robbery.”
