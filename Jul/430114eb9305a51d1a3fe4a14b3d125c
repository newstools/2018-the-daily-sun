MITA Mahlangu is struggling to makes ends meet. This is because the 44-year-old’s disability grant was discontinued after she gave birth to her first child in 2011. The mum from Zenzele section in Thembalethu, near Kwamhlanga in Mpumalanga, said she received a letter from a Sassa official saying she could live off her child’s grant. She said the official also told her to find a job and said it was possible for her to recover from her condition. Mita suffers from epilepsy and is partially deaf. “I was getting a disability grant as I have suffered from epilepsy since childhood. The illness affected me so much I became mentally disturbed,” she said. “I’ve not been taking medication since my grant was stopped. “I’m struggling as the child grant is not enough to support me and my kid.” Mita said she doesn’t have enough money to buy clothes for her child. “We sleep in a shack and don’t have enough blankets to keep us warm,” she said. “If my grant wasn’t stopped, I wouldn’t be in this situation.” Sassa spokesman Senzeni Ngubeni said Mita was granted a temporary disability grant between March and August 2011. He said she should have reapplied if she felt she was still entitled to the grant. Ngubeni said: “When a person is given a temporary disability grant, the duration and reapplication period is explained to them.”
