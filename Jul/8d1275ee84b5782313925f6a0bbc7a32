MARITZBURG United coach Fadlu Davids has admitted that the departure of Bevan Fransman has left a gaping hole in their defence and makes them vulnerable. He says they are hunting for another experienced centre-back to fill the void left by Fransman, who has since joined Highlands Park. “Our squad has many players under 30 years,” Davids said. “We need an experienced player. In the January transfer window Denis Weidlich, our assistant captain and also a centre-back, left us for (Bidvest) Wits. We need to have experience in that department. “We are also on the lookout for an experienced striker. We haven’t replaced Evans (Rusike) after he left for SuperSport United in January. We are still in the market for players in those positions as well as a left-back.” The Team of Choice go into the new season with a new leader on the field in Siyanda Xulu, who has been given the captain’s armband after Fransman’s departure. The coming season will be the third in a row that United tackle with a new skipper – first due to the departure of Kurt Lentjies at the end of the 2016-17 season to join Chippa United and now with Fransman’s move. Following their good run last season, Davids is aware fan expectations will be high for the new campaign. He said, however, that his players should not give in to pressure. Said Davids: “I would like to make this clear, last season we over­achieved as a club. “Our mandate was to ensure the club doesn’t get involved in a relegation battle. We are mandated to secure a top eight finish at the end of the season.” Maritzburg are currently in Potchefstroom for pre-season camp before their quarterfinal clash with home boys Golden Arrows in the KZN Premier’s Cup at KwaMashu’s Princess Magogo Stadium on 28 July.
