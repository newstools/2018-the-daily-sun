RESIDENTS are gatvol because they cannot relax with their families in their own yards. This is because horny people are using a flat in one of the hostels in Mangaung kasi, Free State as a poking spot. According to residents, their children are forced to listen to disgusting noises coming from the flat. When Daily Sun visited the flat, condoms and panties were scattered all over the building. Angry residents now want the building to be demolished or completed. Resident Nompiliso Sthembu (38) said she used to enjoy her lunch under the tree in her yard, but she can’t relax there anymore as she is forced to listen to people screaming while having sex in the flat. “I’m disgusted by the manner in which these people behave. They don’t have any respect. “The sad part is that we can’t chase them away because they boldly tell us to our faces that we don’t own the building,” said Nompiliso. “We can’t live like this. It’s time for the municipality to act.” Residents said other people use the flat to smoke dagga or nyaope. The addicts reportedly rob passersby. Another resident appealed to the municipality to do something about the situation or they would beat the people up. “We are worried that our kids might get raped. We cannot be forced to watch pornography in public. “We will beat them up if they keep behaving like animals,” said the resident. Mangaung municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said: “We will take steps to solve the problem. “Those who are staying there illegally will definitely be kicked out.”
