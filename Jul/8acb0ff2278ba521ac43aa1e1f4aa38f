WHEN Lassie Moeng was mugged the first time, the trains had been running late again. The 47-year-old had arrived at Olifantsfontein Station just before midnight. The second time he was mugged, the Metrorail train simply came to a halt early in the morning between Pretoria and Fountain station, and tsotsis jumped on board. Gatvol Lassie told Daily Sun he had been prepared to accept the first mugging as bad luck, but after the second time, it became clear to him that Metrorail should pay. Lassie, from Winnie Mandela in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, said he was mugged twice within a week. The first incident happened on 10 June and the second one was five days later. In both incidents, he lost money, monthly train tickets, his lunch box, a jacket and cellphones. He wants Metrorail to pay back all that he lost. Lassie said had it not been for the late arrivals of trains and frequent stops in the middle of nowhere, he would not have been mugged. “I told the station manager at Pretoria Station,” he said. Lassie said the manager told him that he would let his superiors know and get back to him. “He never got back to me. I boarded the train without a ticket. Whenever I was stopped by guards I would tell them to call the manager.” He said after boarding for free for a week the manager told him to buy a ticket or face arrest. “They are heartless. They have to pay me everything I lost because it is their fault.” Metrorail spokeswoman Lillian Mofokeng said they are aware of Lassie’s mugging. “The station manager gave him money to travel on the day of the incident. We also asked him to bring proof of that he opened a case for internal investigation,” she said.
