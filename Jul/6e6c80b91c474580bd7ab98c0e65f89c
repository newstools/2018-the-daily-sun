KARABO Taetsane has his neighbours to thank for seeing the sun rise on Monday. It was their screams that woke him from a deep sleep while his shack was being eaten up by flames. The 25-year-old from Klipgat, North West, was fast asleep in the early hours of Monday morning when the fire broke out. He told Daily Sun: “When I woke up, I was greeted by flames and smoke everywhere in the house and I was trapped. “I had no choice but to face the fire. It burned me on the face and a hand, but I managed to get out.” He said even though he was injured, he was happy as things could have worked out much worse. The community managed to extinguish the fire, but it was done too late to save Karabo’s home. His father, George (60), said he was not home when the fire started in the family’s five-roomed shack. “I went to work in the morning and left a candle lit because there was no electricity,” he said. “I used it to give light while I was preparing for work. It must have fallen over when I had already left.” He said seeing his home in ashes felt like a nightmare. “I still cannot believe what happened. It is hard, but I have to accept it,” he said. He and his family had lost everything. “All our clothing, furniture, appliances and important documents were burned,” said George. Neighbours and local churches donated money, clothing, food and building materials to the family.
