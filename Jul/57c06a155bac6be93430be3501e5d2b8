Brown bears ransacked a cemetery and ate at least 20 corpses,
including a recently buried child. Human remains were exposed as the wild animals plundered the
site, and an infant's coffin was among those ripped apart, according to reports. The incident occurred at a cemetery in Russia and Daily Mail reports that two bears have been shot dead. Hunters are now monitoring the graveyard amid fears that
more bears were involved in the attack â€” and will return. Paw prints from the animals are visible at the site. The video was filmed by a bereaved father who was
visiting the graves of his children. Pavel Korotaev said: 'The bears even broke the metal
fences. 'Approximately 20 graves were ruined. 'I can't be sure the total because I was afraid to go
further. 'A bear usually protects its prey, and does not leave it. 'I was lucky, apparently, the animal was sleeping.' Local official Dmitry Shchipitsyn said a team had been
sent to assess the damage. 'In our opinion, the reason that the bear unearthed the
graves was that funeral agencies had done their work in a poor way. 'They did not dig the graves as deep as they should have
done. All the disturbed burials were made this winter and
spring.' He accused the grave diggers of being 'too lazy' to dig
to the correct depth. Russian rules dictate that burials should be to a minimum
of 5ft deep.
