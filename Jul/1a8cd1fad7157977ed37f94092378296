It has been one issue after another for Mampintsha who just can’t seem to catch a break. He has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons lately and it seems there is more drama on the way for him. Gqom duo Destruction Boyz have accused the West Ink boss of not paying what was due to them for their contribution to Babes Wodumo’s hit song Wololo. The duo took to social media to address Mampintsha and his label West Ink. “You better start paying what you owe us Mampintsha and West Ink,” one tweet read. “You busy telling people that, they need Umthandazo (Prayer) at the other hand you doing the evil things. Mampintsha We guess the person who needs Umthandazo (Prayer) is the greediness inside you,” another tweet read. They went on to claim that Wololo catapulted Babes Wodumo to stardom and made a name for West Ink. Check out the tweets below:
