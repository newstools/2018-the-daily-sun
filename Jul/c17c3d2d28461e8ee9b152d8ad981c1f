With the Premier League set to kick off in just over 10 days from now, one of the teams that will be looking for an improved showing altogether is London based Arsenal. The Gunners had their worst season last term under former manager Arsene Wenger, finishing sixth and failing to qualify for the Uefa Champions League for a second successive season. The Frenchman has since made way for Spaniard Unai Emery, who will be looking to turn Arsenal's fortunes around this season. The Former Paris Saint Germain manager has looked to bring in some reinforcements, securing the services of Stephan Lichtsteiner, Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Matteo Guendouzi and Bernd Leno. The most notable acquisition, however, is diminutive midfield workhorse Lucas Torreira who will look to bring stability to the often frail Arsenal midfield. Emery will have to get his charges well drilled as soon as possible as their start to the season could not be tougher, they face defending champions Manchester City. Arsenal's achilles heel under Wenger in recent times had been their lack of big match temperament, often folding too easy against the big sides. This will be put to an early test this season when they host Pep Guardiola's Citizens at the Emirates Stadium on 12 August.
