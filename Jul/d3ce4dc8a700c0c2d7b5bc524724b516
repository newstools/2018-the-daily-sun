IF you need someone to haul your bags all over town but you’re too cash strapped for taxis, maybe it’s time to use a horse! This is the clever plan two young friends from Cradock in the Eastern Cape came up with to earn some cash in these tough times. Soba Kula (20) and Akhona Gwevu (21) usually use their two horses to herd cattle but they saw an opportunity and rode their horses into town. Now they carry people’s luggage around town for a small fee, and even offer a quick gallop for those who want to experience horse riding. Soba told Daily Sun: “I was given the two horses by my father. I discovered there was a high unemployment rate in Cradock so I had to use the horses to generate income. “I was joined by my friend Akhona who rides the other horse. My horse is called Why Not and is three years old, while Akhona rides two-year-old Sisi.” He said they also used the horses to herd their parents’ cattle. “We like herding cattle with horses because they are fast and they react quickly to our instructions. “The other advantage is that these bushes have lots of snakes but horses keep us safe. “We also use our horses to transport people’s luggage because the cost of hiring transport is expensive these days.” Akhona said: “We also offer riding lessons for a small fee to people who want to learn. And we can collect firewood using these horses.”
