A 35-year-old man from the United Kingdom who doesn’t have a penis
allegedly tricked women during sex by using an unknown object. Carlos Delacruz, was in a relationship with two women, and used to
have sex with them by using an unknown object instead of a 4-5. It’s reported that both victims complained of experiencing
'extreme pain' during intercourse with DeLacruz and were forced to stop, and
both suffered from thrush afterwards. Delacruz, from Banknock, near Falkirk, allegedly refused to allow
the women to see him naked and wanted to make out with the lights off. He admitted to penetrating both women with an unknown object
without their consent when he appeared at the city court on Tuesday. According to the Daily Mail, during intercourse he would hold on
to the base of the penis with his hand. The couple split up in January 2016 and the woman informed the
police in May that year after she learned Delacruz had been lying to her and
did not have a penis. Delacruz then began a second relationship with another woman in
August 2016 and after two months of dating they moved in together. The second victim also 'believed Delacruz had a penis' and the
couple always had the lights off during when they had sex. She also suffered 'extreme pain from penetration' during
lovemaking and on the first occasion had to tell Delacruz to stop as she was
bleeding. The couple then had sex around ten times over the course of their
nine-month relationship and the woman also contracted thrush afterwards. The relationship failed in May 2017 due to 'financial matters' the
couple were having and the court was told the woman discovered Delacruz's
sordid secret the following month and decided to call in the police.
