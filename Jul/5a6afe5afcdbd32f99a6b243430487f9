SOUTH African retailer Woolworths has recalled its frozen
savoury rice mix products. The company says the rice contains sweetcorn that is imported
from a factory that is suspected of being the source of a Listeria outbreak in
Europe. “Following a worldwide product recall issued by the
Hungarian Food Safety Agency, and purely as a precautionary measure, we are
recalling our Woolworths Frozen Savoury Rice Mix product (6009173621740),” the
company said in a statement. It added that the Listeria bacteria is easily destroyed by
cooking. “The Frozen Savoury Rice Mix product is uncooked and frozen
and so requires cooking before consumption. Thorough cooking ensures that the
product is safe.” According to Woolworths, they proactively manage and prevent
bacterial contamination of food and have done so for many years. The retailer says they have very strict protocols in place
as part of their standard food safety management process. “To verify the safety of our food products, we implement
additional monitoring where we independently have our food products tested
randomly,” it said in a statement. The retailer advised its customers who bought the product to
return the product for a full refund.
