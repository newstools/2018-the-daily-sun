IT is now or never! Amajita are ready to take on Malawi in their 2019 Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations third round, second leg qualifier at the Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre tomorrow. They are one game away from sealing a spot in the biennial international youth tournament to be held in Niger from 24 February to 10 March next year. Having fired blanks in their first leg encounter with the Junior Flames at the Moruleng Stadium in Rustenburg, Amajita will have to get the job done away. Coach Thabo Senong, who has an injury-free squad available for selection, is confident that his boys will do exactly that – win the match. Said Senong: “Things in camp are going well, we don’t have any injuries. The boys are all looking good. “We are looking forward to the second leg in Malawi. “If we stay disciplined, keep our shape and ensure we don’t concede, we have a good chance of winning the game.” Senong said they would prepare well for Malawi, who have already proved that they are no pushovers by putting five goals past Angola in their second round qualifier. “We are going to hold two training sessions in Malawi just to adapt to conditions before our match on Saturday,” he said. Senong is convinced Amajita will rediscover their scoring ways, and if their defence is as proficient as in the first leg, they will be on their way to Niger next year. Added Senong: “We mustn’t concede. With the way we play, the way we perform, we create many chances and I have no doubt that we should get a goal or two – but definitely, we must not concede.” Should they get past the Junior Flames on Saturday, Amajita will have to reach the semifinals of the 2019 Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations to qualify for next year’s Under-20 World Cup to be staged in Poland.
