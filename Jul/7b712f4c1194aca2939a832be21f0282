A MAN who said he’d recently been traumatised by corrupt cops decided he’d rather risk death than agree to get into their cop bus. According to Punch, engineering student Oluwadara Adedayo (24) was walking across the Cele-Okota Bridge in Lagos State, Nigeria last month. Suddenly, he was stopped by cops who demanded to check his cellphone. Without explaining what he’d done wrong, they then insisted he climb into their cop bus. Oluwadara told Punch: “They ordered me to enter the bus they brought and I refused. I demanded to know what I did to warrant me entering their bus but they did not say anything, only for them to bundle me inside the bus. “I saw an opportunity to escape from the bus and I did. I jumped out of the bus because of my past experience with policemen. A few months ago, some policemen accosted me at Durba (Lagos) and accused me of being an Internet fraudster without any evidence against me. “They took the only N2 000 (about R90) on me before I was released. I suffered before I got home that day.” Armed cops then chased Oluwadara across the bridge, one of them on a motorbike. He said: “When I stopped, the policeman quickly parked his motorcycle and pointed his gun at me, threatening to shoot me. Out of fear, I jumped off the bridge.” The bridge is the height of a multi-storey building. A Good Samaritan rushed the unconscious Oluwadara to hospital, where he was found to have broken both his arms and injured his head. Oluwadara has now been discharged from hospital and is considering reporting the incident. Cops did not respond to Punch’s requests for comment.
