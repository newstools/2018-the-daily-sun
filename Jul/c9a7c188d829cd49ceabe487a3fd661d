ALI Katt was well known for his iconic 1980s song Let The Good Times Roll. But the good times stopped rolling for the singer on Wednesday when he died at Tembisa Hospital in Ekurhuleni following a long illness. After confirming his death, family spokesman Jacky Mathala said Ali Katt, whose real name was Albert Moroasehla, lived, breathed and ate music. Speaking to Daily Sun, Jacky said Ali Katt suffered from a mild stroke four years ago. “He was an active person until he was hit by the stroke. That was when he started slowing down.” Jacky said a memorial service would be held for Ali Katt in Tembisa on Thursday and his funeral would be held in the same area on Saturday. Jacky said everyone who knew him would remember Ali Katt for his sense of humour. “You would be in his presence and when you left, you would be in stitches,” he said. Ali Katt is survived by his two children and a sister. He was born in Alexandra, Joburg, but moved to Tembisa in the 1970s. There he met William Mthethwa and they started performing together. His iconic track Let The Good Times Roll was on his 1987 debut album Have Mercy. After releasing Killer in 1988, he took a long break from music before returning in the 2000s. William remembered him fondly as a stylish man who was always on time. “He was clean, always smiled and never complained. When rehearsals started at 10, he would arrive two hours early,” he said. Yvonne Chaka Chaka said Ali Katt was always smiling and he was never angry. She said he made history with his music.
