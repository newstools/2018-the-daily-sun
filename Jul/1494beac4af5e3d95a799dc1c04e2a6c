BUSINESS owners in kasis north of Durban insist they don’t want shops owned by foreigners in their kasis. On Monday evening, they had a closed meeting with KZN Premier Willies Mchunu at the KwaMashu cop shop to discuss their demands. Journalists were not allowed at the meeting involving Mchunu, KZN Community Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda and officials from eThekwini Municipality. Members of the North Region Business Association said foreigners destroyed their businesses by offering cheap prices and by building shops next to theirs. After the meeting, chairman Mandla Sibaya told Daily Sun they agreed that all kasi shops owned by foreigners and locals should be checked to see if they were operating legally. He said they agreed that no new shops would be opened until the issue was resolved. “Although we reached some agreement, we maintain foreigners must go and let us run our shops in peace. We do not care whether they were running their shops legally or not.” Sibaya said they will have another meeting next week. Last Thursday, local business owners protested against foreigners outside the community hall in L section, KwaMashu. The handing over of 391 operating licences was cancelled due to the protest. Thami Ngidi, the premier’s spokesman, said kasi shops will be checked and pending discussions, no new shops would be opened. “This issue is very sensitive and must be handled carefully. We are still going to hold meetings with all parties to find a solution.” Ngidi said they are also working with the police to make sure there was no looting of foreigners’ shops.
