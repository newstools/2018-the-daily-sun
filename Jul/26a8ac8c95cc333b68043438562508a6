NDOYOSILE Kaleni said no one would dare enter his house. This is because the 59-year-old from De Doorns, Western Cape, has been hanging dolls outside his house for 10 years to keep evil people away. He told Daily Sun one of the dolls was at his front door and another in the corner of his yard. “This house is protected and no one will just come in here, especially evil people. I’m protected by these dolls,” he said. “When there are evil spirits, I feel it because of them. “I can’t tell you more because evil people will read this and I don’t want them to know how I use the dolls.” Ndoyosile, who lives with his girlfriend, said he kept himself busy during the day by enlarging photos for residents. “I was once arrested for house robbery and I spent eight years in jail, but that was long ago. I did that while growing up,” he said. Ndoyosile said he learned to enlarge photos because there were no jobs and he didn’t want to sit at home doing nothing. “My yard is clean and attractive but not to witches. They are afraid and I know they have been trying to get in,” he said. Ndoyosile said he once visited a sangoma when he was sick and was told then he was protected.
