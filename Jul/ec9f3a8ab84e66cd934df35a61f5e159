In a blitz to clean up fraud and corruption at Ekurhuleni licensing departments, four more officials were arrested in Germiston on Friday, bringing the arrest tally to 13 in the last two weeks. Road Traffic Management Corporation (RMTC) announced on Friday that the four Ekurhuleni Metro officials, including a supervisor, were arrested at the Germiston licensing station in Wadeville. On Thursday, five officials were arrested at the Alberton and Bedfordview licensing offices, while four others were arrested at the Benoni licensing department last week. All the arrested officials allegedly colluded with motorists to clear outstanding vehicle licence fees and penalties, which had cost municipalities, provincial transport authorities and the RTMC about R80m annually, RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said. This was done by registering vehicles in the names of deceased people or unsuspecting individuals, before re-registering the same vehicles in the names of the original owners. The arrests form part of investigations by a multi-disciplinary task team comprised of RMTC, the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department's Compliance and Monitoring Unit, the South African Police's Gauteng Special Project Unit and Gauteng Traffic Police Compliance Unit. Investigations are continuing, and more suspects are expected to be arrested. All officials arrested this week are expected to appear in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Monday. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/more-ekurhuleni-officials-arrested-in-licensing-dept-clean-up-blitz-20180727
