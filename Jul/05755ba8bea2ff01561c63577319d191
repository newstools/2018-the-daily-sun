THEMBEKILE Shezi was born in the wonderful year of 1994 when South Africa had its first democratic election. But that’s where the fairytale ended. Thembekile’s mum died a day after giving birth to her and she was raised by her loving uncle. He died when she was just 12, and now she’s stuck in limbo because she doesn’t have an ID. The 24-year-old from Honeydew, northern Joburg told Daily Sun her ID horror started in grade 11 when she wanted to register for matric but couldn’t without an ID. “In my life I have never experienced the love of a mother. I don’t even know what she was like,” she said. “My uncle, Dumisani Shezi, played the role of mum and dad at the same time.” Thembekile’s uncle died in 2006 after a short illness. In 2012, she dropped out of school. She said that whenever she attempted to apply for an ID with her birth certificate, Home Affairs officials told her to bring her uncle’s ID or death certificate. “When my uncle died, his wife sold the house and moved to another place. I went to stay with my older sister. “My uncle’s wife changed her contact details, and she is the only person who can help me with all the documents required by Home Affairs” said Thembekile. “I’m unemployed and I have a child who is two years old but he doesn’t have a birth certificate. “I’m also unable to apply for a child support grant.” Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola took Thembekile’s details and said that they would investigate the matter.
