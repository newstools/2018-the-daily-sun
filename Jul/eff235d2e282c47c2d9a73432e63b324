WESTERN Cape Environmental Affairs MEC Anton Bredell’s department has found a way of fighting shack fires. They’ve been running a pilot project for the past two years, during which eight fires broke out and were detected by their 2000 smoke detectors. “In the two years of the pilot programme, no one died in a fire, compared to other areas around Wallacedene, Kraaifontein.” He wanted the smoke detectors to be used in all kasis in Mzansi. “Extinguishing fires while they’re still small saves lives because it wakes them up,” said Bredell. Western Cape disaster management deputy director Rodney Eksteen said the number of fire-related deaths in South Africa had increased from about 400 in 1980 to 2 276 in 2014. “Between 2009 and 2012, about 5000 informal settlements fires were reported,” he said. “In our opinion, these numbers are underreported and the picture could be worse.” Eksteen said informal settlement deaths were caused by flames and smoke inhalation. “When people are asleep and a fire starts, toxic smoke can cause people go into a deeper sleep until breathing stops altogether. “By the time a fire breaks out it’s often too late. The goal of this project is to motivate municipalities and communities to install smoke alarms in dwellings that will wake people up before it’s too late.” The Wallacedene pilot project was held in partnership with Stellenbosch University, represented by Patricia Zweig. Insurance company Santam paid for the alarms. Eksteen said insects that got inside the smoke alarms were a challenge and they had made small holes to keep them out. He said the alarms, although an old concept, were developed to suit shacks. Bredell said: “It won’t prevent fires. It won’t prevent all deaths. But it has the potential to save thousands of lives.”
