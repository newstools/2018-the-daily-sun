THE City of Ekurhuleni has launched an app that aims to improve service delivery. The Ekurhuleni App, launched in Katlehong yesterday, was create to reduce the high caller volumes at the municipal call centre. It also aims to make long queues at municipal offices a thing of the past. Residents can now report power outages, water leaks, burst sewerage pipes and faulty traffic lights without having to make a call. They can also monitor the status of their query and see other incidents that have already been reported. Other features include the ability to book burial sites and a directory of information, which contains the profile and contact information of municipal managers and councillors. The app is easy to navigate, doesn’t take much data to download and, according to officials, uses less than 50c worth of data to log a query. It has also been designed so that people without smartphones can use it. Chief information officer Tumelo Kganane said once a query is logged, it goes directly to call centre operators, who provide a reference number and send technicians to resolve the matter. He said: “We’re embracing technology because it’s the future. “We’re rolling out free WiFi across the city and currently have 2 500 active WiFi spots. “This is to ensure everyone has access to the internet.” The app can be downloaded from mobile stores. People without smartphones can dial *134*30263#.
