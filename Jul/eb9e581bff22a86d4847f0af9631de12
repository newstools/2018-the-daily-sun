WISE people will always tell you that consistency is key. And University Sports South Africa (USSA) are proof to that in the on-going SAB Under-21 Championships. USSA are one of the most consistent teams in this tournament, as they have been part of the top four since 2013. They have won the competition twice, in 2013 and 2016. Last year they were runners-up when they lost to Gauteng in the final. On Friday, USSA continued with their impressive run when they defeated Gauteng 3-1 on penalties to book a spot in the finals, where they will face Mpumalanga province. The finals of the week-long tournament, which started on Tuesday at Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium will take place later today (3pm) at the same venue. USSA are determined to go all the way and win the tournament., as they have been consistent since the beginning of the week. USSA coach, Godfrey Tenoff, who has been coaching the team for a long time, explained why his side always bring the better competition in the tournament. He stated: “What happened is that we always get continuity from the past year. We normally select the half group to be younger age and the other group to be the age of the tournament. “Normally we have three or four players who come through ever year that were here with us a year before.” Tenoff added: “We want to be on top of this tournament, but most importantly we want exhibit and play good football to show that we are competitive. Going to the final match against free scoring Mpamalanga, we know what needs to be done to ensure we reach our goal.”All these players are not just playing here, they are playing to raise their hands because there are scouts here.”
