WHEN neighbours saw cops arriving in a police van, dressed in uniform with guns, they thought they had come to visit their colleague. But a few hours after they left, neighbours found out they were fake cops who had come to rob Constable Tumi Mollele’s house on Thursday night. They stole a plasma TV, a microwave, and a fridge containing meat, groceries and clothes. They also wanted to take the constable’s car but luckily it wouldn’t start. When neighbours heard screaming coming from the house, they went to investigate. Tumi and his wife, Gertrude, were tied up with rope. Tumi, from Tswaing, Tshwane told Daily Sun they didn’t know the fake cops. He said the uninvited guests told him they had come to search his house. “When I demanded to see a search warrant, they became aggressive. They said I knew too much.” Tumi said one of the suspects wanted to shoot him but his life was spared when another suspect refused to pull the trigger. He said the gang loaded the stolen goods into a Ford Ranger and disappeared. “I had to demand the search warrant because I’m a cop and I know they can’t just search my house without one,” said Tumi. He added that the robbers looked like genuine policemen. A case of house robbery has been opened at the Rietgat cop shop. Captain Stephens Maluleke said they are looking for the fake cops. “Police are appealing to anyone with information to call 08600 10111 or visit the Rietgat Police Station.”
