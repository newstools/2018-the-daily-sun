A GROUP of Walter Sisulu university students have collected close to 1 000 sanitary pads for pupils who can’t afford them. Axola Tshefu, a second-year accounting student and founder of the Mandela 100 sanitary pad drive, said the group of eight is made up of students aged between 19 and 24. He said the group will donate the pads to four schools in the OR Tambo region. “We started the initiative after we saw what schoolgirls go through when they are menstruating. “The group wants the government to recognise the provision of sanitary pads as an essential service. “They must be made available to girls who can’t afford to buy their own,” he said. Axola said the drive will be held every year in honour of former president Nelson Mandela. “We are planning to run an NGO so our efforts to help the community can have a greater impact. “Our aim is to give our beneficiaries three packs of sanitary pads each,” said Axola. Group member Phatho Matolwandile warned boys against making fun of young women who are menstruating. He said: “We will empower women in the community so they can produce sanitary pads for schoolgirls.”
