AS HUMANS, we judge people we don’t know on superficial appearances based on our personal collections of stories, myths, nonsense and sometimes, a few facts. When we see a large or thin person, we make up a story about that person. But too often, our prejudices and biases paint an unflattering or cruel profile of the person that our inner bullies like. Livhuwani “Lebo” Nefolovhodwe (27) started Full Cream Figure in June last year and it is already has more than 20 000 online followers. “I started the group to encourage women to love their larger bodies. “They must not do things to please others. We want to live in a world that doesn’t judge people by how they look.” “We talk about our bodies, lives, fashion, relationships, dreams and more.” Lebo said women need to strengthen themselves mentally and not be discouraged by what others say or think about them. She also speaks up about thin or small-sized women because they too feel the pinch of the public’s judgement. “It is important that the Mzansi men and women love themselves just as they are. “You need to love yourself if you want others to love you back. This is the way to happiness, inner peace and living a full life. “No one can be better at you than you! So love yourself!”
