COPS used teargas yesterday to break up angry University of Fort Hare students at the Alice campus. Thousands of students blocked the R63 with desks and chairs, demanding to write their mid-year exams freely. There has been an ongoing, eight-week strike by the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union. Student representative council leader Life Mabaso said they want to send a message that the strike violates their constitutional rights. “Students were supposed to write exams but were disrupted by union members. We want management and union leadership to see this is affecting us negatively. “We are also calling on the higher education minister to intervene.” Mabaso said students have been ready to write exams since June. One student said: “Management called the police instead of resolving the strike issue. Our future is not taken into consideration. “We want to write our exams.” University spokesman Khotso Moabi said they are trying to resolve the issue. “We condemn the disruption and met the student council to calm things down.” Last month, university staff downed tools after talks between the union and management over wages reached a deadlock. The union demanded a 12% increase but after a month of negotiating, decreased their demand to 8%. The university is offering a 7% increase.
