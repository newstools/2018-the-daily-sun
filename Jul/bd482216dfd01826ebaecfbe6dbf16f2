A man has been arrested for the rape and murder of a little girl after she went missing on her way home on Monday, Western Cape police said. The five-year-old was reportedly last seen playing at her grandmother's home in Khayelitsha until about 18:00, spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said. "The child left for home, but she never arrived. The community started searching for her and her clothes were found near a shack, where her body was found shortly after," she confirmed. The girl had stab wounds to her chest. Rwexana said a preliminary investigation led to the arrest of a 33-year-old man in the Harare settlement. The man is expected to appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court once he has been charged. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/missing-khayelitsha-girl-5-found-raped-and-murdered-20180724
