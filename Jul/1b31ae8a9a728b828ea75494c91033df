POOR gogo Lindiwe Dlamuka (69) died after inhaling deadly smoke from a brazier in her house. Pointing at the triple-storey house next door, neighbours said her neighbour from hell should take the blame. Residents of Senaoane in Soweto told Daily Sun the neighbour arrived some time ago and started building a triple-storey house, with about 30 rooms for rental. “He then connected electricity illegally, taking it from the electricity boxes next to our homes.” They said four weeks ago, problems started with the electricity and two weeks ago, it went off permanently. “We tried to raise the matter with the neighbour’s caretaker since he is never there but the caretaker was just rude to us,” said resident Mildred Makhubu (75). Suffering from cold, Lindiwe, who was sick, and her mentally disturbed daughter Nompumelelo Dlamuka (53) bought coal and made a fire in the brazier. They took it inside, thinking they would remove it when they went to sleep. But they ended up sleeping with it and inhaled the deadly carbon monoxide smoke. Neighbours said they found the dead gogo in the passage of their four-roomed house the next day. Her daughter, who now is fighting for her life in hospital, was found at the door. “It looked as if they were trying to escape the smoke but couldn’t make it out,” said Irene Masikane (70). She said if the neighour from hell had not arrived in the area, Lindiwe would be still be alive. The gogo’s family said they don’t know what they will do. “We have nothing. We don’t know how we will bury her,” said cousin Norah Mbatha (83). “We are gogos. No one is working. We need help,” she said. “We’ve got no means to cook or even boil tea. It’s just bad.” Daily Sun’s efforts to speak to the neighbour or caretaker were unsuccessful. An inquest was opened.
