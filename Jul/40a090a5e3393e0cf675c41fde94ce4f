A YOUNG mum (24) is mourning the death of her three-year-old kid. Gugulethu Mbogwane’s son, Sanele, was killed by a speeding Quantum taxi at Langaville extension 6 in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni on Wednesday. The driver allegedly tried to speed off after the incident, but he was cornered by a resident who chased him down the road in his car. Residents were angry and wanted to teach the man a lesson, but he was saved by police. Gugulethu told Daily Sun she couldn’t bear the pain of seeing her son lying in a pool of his blood at the accident scene. She said that Sanele was going to her neighbour’s house to play with his friends when the incident happened. “I just don’t know what to say. I kissed my boy just before he went outside to play. “But I didn’t know it would be the last time I saw him alive,” she told the People’s Paper. Residents blamed their local councillor for the accident. They claimed the councillor wouldn’t listen to their pleas for speed humps to be erected on the road. A resident said drivers often speed on the road. Community leader Themba Phakathi told Daily Sun: “It seems our kids will keep dying because the councillor doesn’t want to do anything about the issue of speed humps. “We protested many times over this road, asking the councillor to put speed humps because drivers often speed here. “But nothing happened.” Councillor Khosi Gwayana said she had reported the street to the municipality and was waiting for the budget for the speed humps. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Lerato Mngomezulu confirmed the incident. She said cops were investigating cases of culpable homicide and reckless driving.
