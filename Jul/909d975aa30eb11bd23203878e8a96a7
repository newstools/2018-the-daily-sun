THE bright rays of Daily Sun shone on gogo Nkukuthane Mazibuko recently. She turned 124 in May and celebrated her birthday in style. She might appear strong, and she can hear and see clearly, but she’s no longer as energetic as she used to be. Gogo Nkukuthane was born in 1894 on a farm called Mellodora, outside Ottosdal in North West. She now lives in Jouberton extension 22, near Klerksdorp. When Daily Sun published her story, headlined “124 and still going strong” on 15 May, one of her birthday wishes was to get a washing-machine. Bikers from North West, led by Tigers MCC, made her wish come true by donating a brand new washing machine. Tigers MCC organiser Simphiwe Nkwali said they saw gogo’s story in the paper. “We met and decided to help the granny as she was pleading to get a washing machine,” said Simphiwe. Gogo Nkukuthane said: “My wish is that you help everyone and not just me. I’m so excited that my daughter-in-law’s hands will no longer get cold and we’ll be able to wash our clothes quickly.” Putting a smile on people’s faces was another thing the granny said she liked about Daily Sun.
