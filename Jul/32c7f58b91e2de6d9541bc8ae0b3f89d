AS boys turned to men at initiation schools, girls also returned as women to ululation at their villages. None of the women who spent three months in the mountains were happier than Kilibi Mokhonwane. She underwent the cultural tradition at the age of 52! Kilibi, from Masakeng section in Mmametlhake, Mpumalanga is the oldest woman to graduate from an initiation school in Mpumalanga this season. Happy Kilibi told Daily Sun she promised herself no matter how old she was, she wouldn’t rest until she was a full woman according to her cultural tradition. She said now she would be respected by other women and residents. Kilibi said because she never went to be initiated, she had been disrespected her whole life, especially by those younger than her. The disrespect from fellow villagers continued even after she got married and had a child. But on Saturday, she earned her respect as she came back home an initiation graduate. Kilibi said she finally felt like a full woman who would be respected by everybody, especially those in her village. She said she raised a lot of eyebrows when people heard she was going to join the five young women at initiation school. “My family didn’t have money to send me. I watched all my friends and peers in my village go,” she said. Kilibi said as years went by, she remained a laughing stock in her village, with people calling her a girl, no matter how old she was. “I felt as if I was a nobody.” She said now she is finally at peace. “ I’m a happy woman now.” Get help with this initiation app from Daily Sun and Code for Africa: click here for English, and here for Xhosa.
