IT was a close thing for a five-year-old boy when he had
to be rushed to hospital for emergency surgery after swallowing 30 fridge
magnets. The New Zealand
Herald reported this week that Noah Lefau from Melbourne, Australia was
reduced to a limp heap of agony after swallowing 30 tiny magnets he mistook for
sweets. Apparently he had been alone in the kitchen when he
organised himself a chair to reach the shiny magnets up on the fridge.  His mum, Christelle Lefau, rushed him to hospital after discovering
him curled up in pain on the kitchen floor. Xrays showed images of the magnets inside his tummy. The emergency surgery on Noah’s gut took six hours, said Monash
Children's Hospital's Dr Maurizio Pacilli. "I must confess, I've never seen a kid swallow 30
magnets. "They travel along inside the intestine and they are
attracted to each other, so they're trying to get together and by doing this,
they can actually create little holes inside the gut. "We found about 10 or 12 holes, which then we had to
fix and stitch one at a time and also we had to remove parts of the intestine,"
he said. Noah’s dad, Fiso Lefau, said: "You don't think
something so small would do that much damage." Christelle believes if they hadn’t acted so quickly to
get the magnets out of Noah, it would have been curtains. "If it was less than half a day longer he would have
died," she said.
