THABISO Zulu says he has a copy of the Moerane Commission report. The Moerane Commission was established to investigate political killings in KZN. Zulu, who was one of the witnesses during the commission, posted on Facebook that someone gave him a copy of the report. But he does not know this person. Zulu wrote on Facebook: “Will I be breaking any law if I were to share copies of the commission’s report before Premier Willies Mchunu announces it officially and publicly? “Someone I don’t know just gave me an envelope a few days back and in it I found a copy of the report.” He expressed his disappointment. “It’s a useless report, I must say. It’s a waste of our time, energy and the people’s money. Most witnesses and the recommendations we made before we appeared before the commission are not in the report. It’s total whitewash,” he wrote. Speaking to Daily Sun, Zulu insisted he has the report. But he said he is afraid he might be prosecuted if he released it without permission. “I will wait for the premier to release it, but they must not expect that it won’t be leaked in public because anyone can leak it beside me,” said Zulu. Thami Ngidi, spokesman for Premier Mchunu, said: “We were not aware of Zulu’s claims. “But even if it is leaked, no one would be punished for having it because the premier will release it in public anyway.”
