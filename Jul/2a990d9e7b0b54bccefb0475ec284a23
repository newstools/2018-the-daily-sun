SHORTLY after Duduzane Zuma appeared in court, Black First Land First (BLF) members began harassing AfriForum's Kallie Kriel. The members of BLF prevented Kriel from talking to the media, and labelled him a ‘Racist’. Following that they started shouting “No racist is going to speak”, as Afriforum’s Kriel was escorted by the police out of the crowd. "You must go back home to Holland, Holland is home, not here. You have no place in this country," BLF leader Andile Mngxitama said as he was addressing Kriel. The group was insulting Kriel because, AfriForum wanted to launch a private culpable homicide prosecution against Duduzane Zuma. This following the National Prosecuting Authority decision not to charge Zuma previously. In 2014, Duduzane crashed his Porsche on the Grayston Drive off-ramp on the M1, north of Johannesburg into the back of a taxi and two people died. The two victims who died in the incident were Phumzile Dube, who died on the scene and Jeanette Mashaba later on. In July 2014, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) declined to prosecute Zuma and cited insufficient evidence.
