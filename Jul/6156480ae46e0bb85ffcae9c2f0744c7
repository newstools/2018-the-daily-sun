THE traffic cops were patiently waiting for speeding motorists when they caught a car blitzing by at 180km/h in a 120km/h zone. Cops were shocked to find that the speeding car was driven by a Mamelodi Sundowns soccer star, who has been arrested together with 31 other motorists. In a special high-speed operation conducted
by the Gauteng Traffic Police’s High-Speed Unit this weekend, motorists were
arrested for high speed ranging from 161km/h to 219km/h. The 32-year-old soccer star was bust on Sunday morning
on the N1 in Midrand.  "He claimed that he was rushing back
home in Roodepoort after dropping of a friend in Centurion," Gauteng
Department of Community Safety's Ofentse Morwane said in a statement. He said the player was arrested on the spot
and taken to the Midrand Police Station where he was formally charged with
reckless driving and an alternative charge of exceeding the speed limit of
120km/h on a freeway. He has been granted a bail of R1500 and will
be appearing in the Midrand Magistrate Court soon. The highest speed recorded for this weekend
was on the N1 North of Pretoria where a driver of the Audi Q5 was caught doing
219km/h. The driver claimed that his farther was admitted to hospital in
Polokwane but it could not be confirmed. The Department of Community Safety
encourages drivers to adhere to the rules of the road.  Reckless driving and excessive speeding is
one of the major contributors of fatal crashes the roads in the province. Gauteng Traffic Police and the other law
enforcement agencies will continue to deal decisively with those who do not
adhere to the rules of the road particularly given the high rate of fatalities
that the province continue to experience.
