ABOUT 133 protesters appeared in the Galeshewe Magistrates Court yesterday. This was after 202 people were bust last week for public violence, looting of businesses and malicious damage to property during a protest in the Kimberley CBD. Residents of Kimberley came out in numbers to call for those who were arrested to be released. Cops monitored the situation while some angry residents protested outside the court. Residents said they wouldn’t rest until the mayor, chief financial officer and municipal manager had resigned from Sol Plaatjie Municipality. Following incidents at the weekend, residents vowed that the chaos and disruption would continue until their demands were met. Police spokeswoman Colonel Mashy Gamieldien said no arrests were made yesterday and no injuries were reported. “Sixty people will appear in the Kimberley Magistrates Court while 133 will appear in the Galeshewe Magistrates Court again,” she said. “Nine people appeared on Friday and were granted bail of R300 each. “At this stage cops are patrolling hot spot areas.”
