THE reckless behaviour of students at universities inspired Zikhona Mbala (24) to write a book. In 2015 Zikhona moved from Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape to Durban to study civil engineering at Thekwini TVET Coastal College. However, she soon found that many students were more interested in living lavishly than making something of themselves. She said her book is a cautionary tale about the dangers of losing your way when you move to the city or have spare money at hand. Zikhona launched My Heart Deceived Melast month at Skoobs Theatre of Books in Joburg. She said it took her two years to write it. “My book is about how some students are deceived by older men who give them expensive clothes and money in exchange for sex,” said the young writer. Zikhona said she saw many students with bright futures turn into drug addicts. “Parents save up so their children can have a brighter future. “But instead of studying, their children are chasing the good life in big cities. “I can only imagine how painful it is for parents to send their child to an institution of higher learning, only for them to return ill or dead,” she said. Zikhona encouraged parents to read the book as it will give them an idea of how to keep an eye on their children while they are at college or university.
