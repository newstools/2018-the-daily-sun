LAST week was long and torturous for some residents of NU 10 in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth. A river of kak has been flowing down their streets, submerging their yards and the local playground in smelly water. The residents who live in Mpando and Zama streets accused the municipality of ignoring their pleas for help. One resident said: “This pipe is always bursting. The municipality should now be in a position to know what causes it. “The recent burst happened on Tuesday. “Our yards are covered in sewage. “The smell is so unbearable that we are forced to remain indoors with our windows closed. “Our children have nowhere to play because the playground is filled with kak.” Mfana Tiler (41) said he lives in NU 11 but often visits a friend who lives in Mpando Street. “I will come back only after the sewage problem is fixed. “This is not good for residents’ health. “Children might fall ill if they play near the sewage.” A nine-year-old boy who often plays with his friends at the local playground said he felt nauseous and weak. “I no longer have an appetite. “I think it is because of the sewage. “This is the only playground in the area but it is covered in kak.” Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Kupido Baron said: “Workers from the Addo Depot investigated and found there was a problem with our sewer pump station. “The problem has been sorted out and one of our teams will monitor the situation.”
