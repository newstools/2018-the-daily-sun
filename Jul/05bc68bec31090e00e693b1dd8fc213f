WHEN the municipal workers came to install a stormwater drain near madala Obed Xaba’s house in 2012, he warned them that his daughter’s grave was also in his yard. His pleas for caution fell on deaf ears, and not only was the grave destroyed but his daughter’s bones disappeared, too. And for six years the 77-year-old madala from Cutshwayo at KwaNdengezi has been fighting a losing battle to get her bones back. Madala Xaba’s daughter Ntombikayise died in 2002. He claimed her bones were unearthed by eThekwini Municipality’s employees in 2012 without his permission. “Before they started working, they told me they would remove everything near the edge of the yard. I cautioned them about Ntombikayise’s grave but they didn’t listen. They came and tampered with it and removed the bones while I wasn’t home,” said the madala. He said the grave didn’t have a tombstone. He alleged that the workers also took his five cows away when they destroyed the kraal and fence. He said he has been going in and out of municipal offices in an attempt to have the matter resolved. “An official called Mlungisi Ntombela from the office of the mayor promised that he would help me but I’m still waiting,” said madala Obed. He said even though he never had bad dreams of his daughter, he was worried because there were rituals he was supposed to perform. “I don’t care about the cows and the fence they took. All I want is my daughter’s bones,” said madala. Municipal spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said Ntombela was working on the matter. “Since it’s a sensitive matter, we prefer to talk directly with Xaba, not with the media,” he said.
