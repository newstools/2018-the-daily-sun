THE father of a missing girl blames himself for not intervening when the girl told him a relative was abusing her. Nomfundo Shozi (12) from Bhambayi, north of Durban, ran away from home after she broke a window while playing with friends. Her dad Sboniso Dubazana (31) from Richards Bay said she used to tell him she wanted to come and live with him because a relative beat her. “When she told me, I thought she was just being naughty and didn’t want to be disciplined,” said Sboniso. “But running away because she feared a beating proves she was scared of the relative. “I hope my daughter is found alive so she can come to live with me.” He said he’d make sure she never ran away again. Sboniso said Nomfundo’s mum had told him children needed to be punished if they did something wrong. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Nomfundo was last seen on 22 June. “She was wearing green three-quarter trousers and a red T-shirt,” Zwane told the People’s Paper. He appealed to anyone with information regarding Nomfundo’s whereabouts to contact the Inanda cop shop on 031 509 5871 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
