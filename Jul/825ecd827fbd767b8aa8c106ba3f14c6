RESIDENTS of Aquadene, in northern KZN, refuse to let a local RDP housing project continue until the municipality hires members of the community. The project has been on hold since Friday after residents staged a protest. Resident Sabelo Dlamini (33) said: “The mayor called the community in May to inform us that a housing project was going ahead in our kasi. “We were excited when he told us young people would be employed. “He said he would let us know when to submit CVs to the ward committee.” Sabelo said they were still awaiting feedback from the mayor when they saw building materials being delivered to their kasi. “We also saw people from outside our community driving into our kasi in bakkies. “When we asked them where they were going, they said they had come to work on the housing project. “That made us very angry, which is why we demanded that the project be suspended.” Sakhile Nkosi (41), another resident, said he and the rest of the community are still waiting for the mayor to let them know what is happening. “We want to submit our CVs. “The project will not start until then,” he said. Umhlathuze municipal spokesman Mdu Ncalane said the project has been put on ice. He said: “There was confusion about the hiring process but we are working on it.”
