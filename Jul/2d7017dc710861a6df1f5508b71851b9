SIBONGILE Radebe (43) was shocked when she found out her mum had been moved from an old age home without any notification. Sibongile said her mum, Gladys Banda, moved into Vukuzenzele Old Age Home in zone 14 of Sebokeng, the Vaal, in February. “But when I went back at the end of the month they told me my mum was moved to a home in zone 12,” she said. Sibongile said the living conditions at the new home were awful. “The elderly folks are not given toiletries or proper food,” she said. A staff member at the home told Daily Sun: “I came into this field to help people but here it seems like we are doing the opposite. “It’s hard to witness the hardships these gogos and madalas go through. “There is not much I can do for them.” She said some of the elderly people at the home go to checkups on an empty stomach. She also claimed some of them sleep on the floor. “I told management about the lack of food, toiletries and beds but no one seems to be doing anything about it,” claimed the worker. Vukuzenzele manager Puleng Jandela (71) denied the allegations. “We take care of everyone at the zone 12 branch,” she said. Jandela admitted it was wrong of her not to inform Sibongile of the move. “I moved her mum to the zone 12 branch, which is run by a woman who once worked for me.” Gauteng Social Development spokesman Thebe Mohatle said the department’s Sedibeng branch doesn’t know about the facility. He said: “The region will send a social worker to investigate. “The facility is not in our database and is therefore deemed unsuitable to live in.”
