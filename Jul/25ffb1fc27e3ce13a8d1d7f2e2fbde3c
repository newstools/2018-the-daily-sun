HUNDREDS of mourners from as far as Mozambique gathered at Zola extension sports grounds in Songeni outside Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga on Saturday. They came to pay their last respects to two of the three men who were killed in separate incidents last Sunday. Local soccer player Ronnie Moyane (33) was allegedly killed during a fight and died after his throat was cut with a beer bottle. Mandla Khosa (28) was gunned down during a stokvel meeting argument. Samson Khoza (34), who was stabbed to death at a petrol station at Thulamahashe Plaza, was buried at his parents’ home in Naas near Komatipoort on Saturday morning. Mzamane Moyane (54) told mourners his son Ronnie crawled home after his throat was cut, but his killer followed him and struck him with a big stick to finish him off. Mandla’s brother Perfect (26) said his brother was killed just for standing on another man’s foot. “Young people are dying for senseless reasons. “We need amaberete’s intervention because we are no longer safe,” he said. Thulamahashe Football Association chairman Noel Malope said five people from the village had been murdered since January. “A seven-year-old boy and a disabled man aged 26 were also killed. “We need serious interventions to address these senseless killings,” said Malope. Jonathan Mathebula, who directed the funeral programme, said there should be consequences when someone commits crime. He said every resident is now living in fear as they all are targets of such senseless attacks. Mhala Police Station commander Colonel John Ngwenya said they had opposed bail for the two bust suspects and were still hunting Samson’s killer, who is on the run. The two suspects, aged 30 and 34, are facing murder charges and are expected to appear in the Mhala Magistrates Court today and tomorrow.
