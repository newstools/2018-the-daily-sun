THE THUGS thought that they had hit the jackpot! This was after they went on a hijacking spree, terrorising people and taking their belongings. But their moment was short lived because cops soon pounced on them. Three men were arrested for stealing two cars at Olievenhoutbosch in Tshwane on Wednesday. Police spokesman Constable Tumisang Moloto said the three suspects aged between 29 and 35 years were arrested at Wierdabrug in the Raslow area. He said two vehicles, a bronze Ford Kuga and a white Chevrolet Spark, had earlier been reported stolen. The police crime prevention and tracing team followed up on a tracker signal which led them to a house in Kgonte Street in extension 37, Olievenhoutbosch. “Both vehicles were recovered, as well as two laptops and plasma TV believed to be taken during a housebreaking in Raslow,” he said. Moloto said a case of possession of stolen motor vehicles was opened at Olievenhoutbosch cop shop for further investigation. The trio will appear in the Pretoria Magistrates Court later this week.
