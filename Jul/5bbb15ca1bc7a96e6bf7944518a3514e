IT’S the time of the year again where fashion and glamour stream to the racecourse. Punters take their chances on the horse of their choice. But who will win the famous Vodacom Durban July run over 2 200 m at the Greyville course in Durban tomorrow? The SunTeam asked sangomas who they would put their money on if they were going to bet. Traditional healer Mahlinza Dlamini from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni said the ancestors revealed to him that number 15 would be the winning horse. “I threw the bones and my ancestors revealed four horses to me starting with number 15, Made to Conquer, with Jeffrey Lloyd in the saddle. The horses that will follow are number eight, three and six,” he said. He said he was also going to place a bet because he was so sure about his prediction. Chairman of the KZN Traditional Healers’ Association, Thandonjani Hlongwane, said the ancestors revealed two numbers to him. “My bones showed me number six and number 13. I know for a fact these two horses are the ones to bet on,” said Hlongwane. The favourites are African Night Sky and Do It Again.
