AN EASTERN Cape farmer has come up with a way of discouraging squatters from invading his land. The management of Habata Farm recently dug a trench two metres deep on the doorstep of Izinyoka squatter camp in Valencia, Addo. The squatters say they have been living in the area for many years and cannot be moved. The municipality installed water taps for them. Semi Notshoba (58) said a few months ago they woke up to a trench being dug in front of their shacks. He told Daily Sun: “The municipality has no issues with us because we have been here for many years. This trench is dangerous to us and our children.” He said the farmer never informed them about the trench. The trench is in front of Lorraine Booysens’ shack. She lives in constant fear that her two-year-old daughter could fall into the trench. She said: “This place is no longer safe for us. I am always holding my daughter’s hand to keep her safe.” Councillor Anthony Dancey said he could not move the people because they had been living there for many years. “The government should negotiate with the farmer and buy the land. The only way to resolve this issue is to buy it,” he said. The residents occupied the site in 2000. An official at Habata Farm told Daily Sun on the phone: “I will not respond to the media. Go and write whatever you want.”
