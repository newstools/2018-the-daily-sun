HE WAITED for an RDP for many years but now he can’t sleep properly in the house. The People’s Paper published madala Mohale Musi’s story on 3 February 2016. He was promised a house years before. He finally got the house in Bochabela, Free State, but he has not had any sleep for the two years since he moved in. The 82-year-old claimed he was being tortured by an evil creature. He said the tokoloshe pulls him by his legs while he is sleeping, and sometimes it tells him to sleep on the floor or in the sitting room. He said different nyangas told him people were jealous of his new five-roomed house. “I was promised a house because my brother, George Musi, was killed and burned during the apartheid era. “I received a letter from the office of former president Nelson Mandela during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The letter stated that I deserved to get a house and social welfare to honour my brother,” said Mohale. “After I receiving the house, I dreamt of people sprinkling muthi around it.” Sangoma Ndabazomoya Sotshononda said: “This is the work of jealous people. They are using a zombie to torment the old man. He needs a strong nyanga who will cleanse his home.”
