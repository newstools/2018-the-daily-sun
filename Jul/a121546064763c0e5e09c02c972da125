THE late Nelson Mandela and UDM leader Bantu Holomisa had a good relationship. When Madiba died in 2013, Holomisa was appointed to help with the burial preparations in Qunu, Eastern Cape. Holomisa told Daily Sun that Madiba was a great man. “The first time I visited Madiba at his Soweto home in 1999, he was wearing a white shirt. He came out and opened his arms with a smile and said, ‘Holomisa, your contribution in the struggle is noted. You serve the people with loyalty’.” Holomisa said Mandela was a parent, not only to his kids but to everyone. “When you were with Mandela, you always felt as if you were sitting with a parent. His level of conversation was that of a father figure, whether you knew him from politics or personally. “He was everything the struggle needed,” said Holomisa. “I remember how he would put other world leaders on the spot. “He never regarded the diplomacy rules. “Had there never been a Mandela in politics, Mzansi wouldn’t be where it is now.” Holomisa said he remembered the time he accompanied Mandela to a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. “Madiba was highly regarded by world leaders. He arrived at the meeting and started telling people what to do.” Comparing politics during Mandela’s times to today, Holomisa said Madiba’s legacy was being ruined by his party, the ANC. “It’s unfortunate that even his party is killing Madiba’s legacy. “His own people are killing his dream of a democratic nation with their looting of state resources for their personal gain. That’s an insult to the person of Mandela.” Holomisa said Mandela never abused his power because he was a president of the people.
