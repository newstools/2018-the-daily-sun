PEOPLE burned it down but now the people’s train is back! Gauteng Metrorail will reintroduce new blue trains between Pretoria and Pienaarspoort stations today. The new trains will be limited to run during off-peak hours between 9am and 3pm on week days. According to the current time table, the old yellow trains will run in the early morning and afternoon in peak hours. Metrorail Gauteng manager Goodman Matampi said the new blue trains will be used at weekends too. Train services running between Pretoria and Pienaarspoort were suspended on 14 March following a series of incidents of vandalism and assault on Metrorail officials. “A total of 19 employees were assaulted and six trains vandalised at a cost of R6 million,” he said. He said the service was reintroduced on 21 May but that only old sets had been used as the new trains were still being got ready. Matampi said Metrorail had numerous meetings with the communities of Pienaarspoort and other interested organisations, which resulted in the signing of a social compact as a commitment to protect the trains. He said Mzansi was desperately trying to improve the public transport system with government injecting billions to make this a reality. He called on the public and leaders to expose those who placed the lives of innocent commuters and Metrorail officials at risk. Matampi also urged commuters to report all incidents to their nearest police station or contact Metrorail Security and Protection Services on 011 013 0055/57. Provincial Metrorail spokeswoman Lillian Mofokeng also condemned the flyer that was circulating stating there would be no trains running in Mamelodi starting on Monday. The flyer reads: #No Station Entry!! Azikwelwa!! Azigitshelwa!!. “The flyer is not official and Metrorail doesn’t know of any such boycott of its trains,” she said.
