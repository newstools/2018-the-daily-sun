PULANE Sefuthi (55) can sleep peacefully again now that her son Sithembiso (25) is home. On Tuesday Daily Sun published a story about Pulane, who is from Braamfischerville in Soweto. She was looking for Sithembiso, who ran away from home three month ago after he stole his brother’s sound system to buy nyaope. After he read about his mum’s suffering in the People’s Paper, he decided to go back home. Sithembiso said he is still addicted to nyaope but he is ready to change. “I was afraid to go back after I stole from my brother. “I was sharing a room with a group of nyaope addicts. “We slept on the floor with very few blankets. “I moved from one hostel to another,” he said. Sithembiso is now living with his gogo in Dube, Soweto. “I have cut back on my smoking,” he said. “I smoke only in the morning because the stomach cramps are painful. “I started smoking in 2006 and I managed to hide the addiction from my mum for many years.” He said his habit might lead to his death. “Life never ends well when you are a drug addict.” Pulane said: “When I saw Sithembiso again, he was so filthy that I could not recognise him. “I am happy that he has come back home alive.” She said she would like to have her son admitted to a rehabilitation centre.
