IT WAS like a mini war zone yesterday morning when taxi operators clashed over routes. Five drivers were shot and wounded in the Tshwane CBD and two taxis went up in flames. Commuters were left stranded and motorists stuck in traffic. According to a taximan on the scene, drivers operating in Menlyn and Hatfield were fighting over a route. He accused Hatfield drivers of using Menlyn drivers’ route. He said the rivals had tried to come to an understanding but no agreement was reached. Mxolisi Ragalakane, an operator from Menlyn, said the Hatfield group was harassing them and demanding to use their route. He said all five of the wounded drivers belonged to his association. “About nine shots were fired and five of our own were shot,” said Mxolisi. “Three are currently in a critical condition in hospital.” Hatfield drivers told the People’s Paper they should also be allowed to use the route.  They said the Menlyn group didn’t have enough taxis to transport everyone. “They’re just being greedy. People get to work late because their taxis are always full,” said one driver. “If we also transport those people, it won’t change a thing and everyone will benefit.” Police spokeswoman Colonel Nomasonto Kweza confirmed that five people were shot during what appeared to be a fight over taxi routes. She said police had not made any arrests yet but investigations were under way. Tshwane Transport MMC Sheila Lynn Senkubuge condemned the violence. She said taxi operators should not endanger the lives of commuters and bystanders.
