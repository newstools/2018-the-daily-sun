IT HAS been a year since Sindiso Magaqa was shot in an apparent hit in Umzimkhulu, along with two other councillors. The former ANC Youth League secretary and Mzimkhulu municipality councillors Nontsikelelo Mafa and Jabu Mzizi were gunned down on 13 July. Magaqa died at a Durban hospital in September. Thabiso Zulu, Magaqa’s best friend who testified at the Moerane Commission of Inquiry, is concerned because the killers are still on the loose. He told Daily Sun: “Of course I did not expect the Hawks to swiftly arrest the suspects, but I also didn’t think it would take them more than a year to do so.” Zulu is in hiding as he fears that the killers will also kill him for testifying before the Moerane Commission. Hawks spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi said they are still investigating a case of murder. “We can’t just make the arrest without a thorough investigation,” he said. “We appeal to anyone who has information to come forward.” One of the suspects, Jabulani Mdunge (38), who was linked to the murder, was shot and killed by police during a foiled cash-in-transit heist in September. The Hawks said then they were still searching for the second suspect. Family spokesman Lwazi Magaqa (51) said: “A suspect was killed, but how do we know that he was linked to the murder? We asked the Hawks to explain, but they have failed to do so.”
