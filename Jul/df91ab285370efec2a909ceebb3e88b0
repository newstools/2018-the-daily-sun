TRAFFIC cops had their hands full at the weekend. No less than 31 motorists were arrested for exceeding the speed limit. Mamelodi Sundown’s Tebogo Langerman was bust racing down the N1 in Midrand at a blistering 180km/h! When cops confronted the player, his excuse was that he had been in a hurry to get home. He was arrested on the spot and taken to the Midrand Police Station. He was granted bail of R1 500. According to Gauteng Community Safety spokesman Ofentse Morwane, the highest speed recorded at the weekend was that of an Audi Q5 driver bust doing 219km/h on the N1, north of Pretoria. Mamelodi Sundowns spokesman Thulani Thuswa confirmed that Tebogo had informed the club about his arrest and said it won’t happen again. “The team will be in talks with Tebogo and he will face the consequences of his action. We expect senior players like him to lead by example as thousands of our youth look up to him,” Thuswa said.
