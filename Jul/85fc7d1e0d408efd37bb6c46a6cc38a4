CAPE TOWN City coach Benni McCarthy has uncovered a secret weapon in striker Siphelele Mthembu. McCarthy says Mthembu is the missing piece of their puzzle as they strive to wrest the Absa Premiership title away from Mamelodi Sundowns. The 30-year-old player, who scored five goals for Free State Stars last season, joined the Citizens last week on a one-year deal with an option to renew. Mthembu replaced Lyle Lakay, who recently joined Downs. Mthembu is expected to make his debut for City against his former club Kaizer Chiefs in the Mpumalanga Cultural Experience Cup at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Having finished the 2017-18 season in fifth position in the Premiership table, McCarthy is confident his side will come out tops come end of the new season. Said McCarthy: “We are a club that want to improve and make a name for ourselves. This season we want to take it a step further, set the pace and control games. That’s why I have signed strikers with the hunger to succeed.” The coach is confident that Mthembu has the ability to score double figures. “What was missing last season was a striker who can come in and score 10 goals. That would have made a big difference in our side, as we would have pushed Mamelodi Sundowns more than we did. We didn’t have a striker who could put the ball in the net and I am glad we’ve sorted that out. “We have guys capable of scoring now and are not afraid to use them to hit where it hurts most. We have Rusike and Shaka Zulu (Mthembu), so hopefully we will win the league.” The Bafana Bafana all-time top scorer revealed that his starting lineup for the Amakhosi game would play in City’s first league match against SuperSport United at Cape Town Stadium next Saturday. “This game is the best preparation you can have. This is the last friendly, no more test runs. “We will have a full strength squad against Chiefs and it is 99.9% guaranteed that this lineup will start our first league game. I hope we don’t get injuries.”
