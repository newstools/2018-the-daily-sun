WHEN Cynthia Chivambo’s husband died in 2016 after a battle with cancer, his suffering mercifully ended. But unfortunately for gogo Cynthia, this was the beginning of her suffering. Soon after her husband Emmanuel’s death, Cynthia (63) had a stroke – leaving her unable to work and struggling to put food on the table. She also has to take care of her nine-year-old granddaughter but can’t afford even the basics for the little girl. The gogo from Mamelodi East phase 4 cried as she told Daily Sun she urgently needed help. She lives with her granddaughter Cynthia Thompson in a rented shack. Her granddaughter doesn’t have a school uniform or stationery. “I can’t work because of my condition and my grant money isn’t enough,” said gogo Cynthia. She pleaded for blankets, food or anything that could help them get through the day. The little girl pleaded with Good Samaritans to buy her books, coloured pencils, scissors, glue, a ruler, an eraser, a pencil case, a school bag and a plastic cover. Neighbour Alice Sithole (31), who helps them with food and laundry, said she wished to see them living in a better home. Gauteng Social Development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said the department sent social workers to visit the family and assess their situation. “We will definitely intervene,” he told the People’s Paper. Tshwane MMC for Human Settlements Mandla Nkomo said gogo Cynthia should go to the Mamelodi Mini Munitoria in Denneboom and tell housing department officials she and her granddaughter should be considered a special case.
