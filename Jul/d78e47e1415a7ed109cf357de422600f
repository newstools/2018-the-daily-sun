ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa thanked his ancestors in KZN on Saturday after the party finally held its long-awaited elective conference. In his closing address at the conference, held at the Durban University of Technology, he said in Zulu: “Amadlozi ami angisebenzele kakhulu ngokuphumelela kwale conference.” (My ancestors did a good job in making this conference a success). He said unity in the province, the party’s stronghold, was very important. He set a target of 60% of votes for the party in next year’s election. He said to achieve that all members had to campaign to get 15 million votes, compared to the 11 million obtained in the last election in 2016. He urged those who lost not to resort to court battles. Sihle Zikalala was elected chairman and Nomusa Dube-Ncube as treasurer, both unopposed. The secretary position, contested between Super Zuma and Mdumiseni Ntuli, was won by Ntuli. Zikalala called for unity and said the party was the real winner. The deputy secretary position was won by Sipho Hlomuka, who beat Mluleki Ndobe and Bongi Sithole-Moloi. Mike Mabuyakhulu defeated Willies Mchunu for the deputy chairman position. He emphasised the importance of unity. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi was the biggest winner, narrowly beating Lebogang Maile for the deputy chairman position.
