SOCCER fans were glued to their screens across the world, watching the month-long soccer spectacle. After France were crowned the 2018 World Cup champions in Moscow on Sunday, social media was abuzz. Users not only congratulated the winners, but there were hilarious photos of life “going back to normal” in many households. Men shared funny pictures of themselves officially handing over the TV remotes to their wives and girlfriends. NnaBuEnyi (@ewikizAUU) wrote on Twitter: “It’s over now!!! Just did the official handing over of the remote control back to the wife in my house. “Hopefully there’ll be another handover of the same remote in about a month’s time.” Akani Mathonsi (@thonsis91) said: “Tomorrow morning at 10 we declare an official remote handover ceremony.” SirVAGE (@Sirvagery) wrote: “To all the men who controlled the remote from 14 June till today, kindly do the handover this night, your tender is finished. And new episodes of Zee World are coming up! Thanks.” Some said the handover won’t last long. Lwastos? (@Lwazi_Brice) said:“As we witness the official handover of the remote to the wife by husband, I solely say this won’t last long as the 2018/19 soccer league season is at its dawn. Let the wars begin.” An invitation was also trending which said: “Ladies and Gentlemen, let me invite you to an auspicious function tomorrow at my place to officially hand over the remote control to my wife and children. Time 21:00. You are all invited.”
