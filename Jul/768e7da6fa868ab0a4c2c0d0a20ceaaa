CREATURES of every shape and size are living in terror in
parts of Florida as massive snakes go on the rampage. According to news.com.au, the seeds for today’s disaster
were planted back in 1992 when the fourth strongest storm to have hit America,
Hurricane Andrew, ripped through Florida. It destroyed a snake breeding facility in the lush
Florida Everglades, resulting in 900 baby Burmese pythons being released into
the wilds. Twenty-six years later, not only are the baby pythons all
grown up, but they’re breeding like crazy. Female Burmese pythons can lay up to 100 eggs a year. Local wildlife is under attack from the pythons, which
can grow to longer than 7 metres long. Bob Goss, who lives in the Everglades, said: “The problem
with pythons is they’re eating everything up. “They’re eating the birds, the raccoons, the possums, the
alligators, the deer, the hog … everything! “If we don’t get a handle on this soon there’s going to
be nothing out here but snakes!” People are also terrified, after hearing stories of
people being swallowed by pythons like these in places like Indonesia. Biologist Rob Nelson said: “To eat a person a snake has
to overcome some major hurdles. “First, it has to get close enough to strike. Next, it
needs to be quick enough to catch that person. Then, it would need to be strong
enough to prevent them from escaping its grasp.” Of course, a Burmese python can do all of these things. Brave python hunters are being paid $50 (about R660) for
every python they kill. About 1 100 pythons have so far been removed in this
programme.
