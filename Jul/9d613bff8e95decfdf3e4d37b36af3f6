SOME people try to get South Africans to tear each other apart, but this project is aimed at bringing them together. It’s centred around the statues of King Goodwill Zwelithini and late former president Nelson Mandela. It will also include a monument honouring the history of the Zulus, the Boer republics and Indians’ arrival in Natal. The Isivananda World Peace Foundation announced yesterday it had received the go-ahead to build the monument and statues in Mitchells Park, Durban. Foundation head Ishwar Ramlutchman told Daily Sun the plan was approved by the municipality’s executive committee on Tuesday. Ramlutchman, who has close ties with the king, wrote to Zwelithini and the municipality asking for permission to build statues. After mayor Zandile Gumede presented the project at a committee meeting, all members including opposition parties liked it and it was approved. Ramlutchman said work was due to begin soon. “This is about the rainbow nation. We want to preserve our heritage,” he said. “I needed something that would bring together diverse groupings in the country. “I want the next generations to know where this province came from.” Gumede said the project, which is funded by the foundation, would boost tourism and create jobs.
