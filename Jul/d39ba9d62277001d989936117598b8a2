SOUTH Africans, please pray for the taxi industry. This was the plea from Reverend Jacobs Sefanyetso of the Faith Life Christian Centre in Ivory Park, Ekurhuleni. “When you wake up in the morning, pray for the taxi industry because the devil is working to destroy it,” he said. Jacobs was speaking yesterday at a memorial service for the Ivory Park Taxi Association taximen killed on Saturday night. The service was held at Rabie Ridge Community Hall, Ivory Park. Xolani Mncube, Vusumuzi Gumede, Ndumiso Sithole, Mondli Gasa and Bafana Skhosana and queue marshal Mzamo Dlomo were on their way from the funeral of another taxi driver in KZN when they were attacked on the R74 between Colenso and Weenen. Twelve people died when unknown men opened fire at their minibus taxi. Families and friends of the dead men couldn’t hold back their tears. Johannes Mkhonza, an association spokesman, said their drivers were professional. “You can even see from the way they dress,” he said. Justice Hlongwane, a driver, said: “We worked nicely with our brothers. “We’re all shocked by what has happened.” Pastor Thomas Hadebe told the mourners to celebrate the six men. “They played their part.  They gave this industry and the association all they had,” he said. He said their lives needed to be celebrated. Santaco’s Gauteng chairman Ralph Jones said he had been attending murdered taximen’s funerals every weekend for the past three weeks. Jones promised that a prayer meeting would be held at Ellis Park Stadium on 18 August.
