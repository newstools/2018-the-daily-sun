Idols SA season 3 winner Paxton Fellies is heading to Russia to perform at the country’s biggest cultural event, The White Nights of St Petersburg. The festival taking place from the 20th to the 22nd of July is set to be broadcast across Russia on their public broadcasting channel. Since winning season 3 of Mzansi’s most popular singing competition, Paxton has been hard at work trying to solidify her brand in the entertainment industry. The 17 year-old’s busy schedule included a tour to Sweden and she also took some time to work on her debut album. Her much anticipated album titled This is Me, was well received upon its release and so was the accompanying single Angifuni. The Cape Town songstress can’t wait to perform in Russia 5 days after the conclusion of the biggest sporting showpiece, the World Cup. “It feels like a dream”, said Paxton, “I can’t believe I get to perform some of my new material for Russian audiences, and get to see the buzz of the Soccer World Cup aftermath. “I really could not be more excited right now.”
