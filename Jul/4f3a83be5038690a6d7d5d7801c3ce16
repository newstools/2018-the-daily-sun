A HORSE named Do It Again won the race, but Zodwa Wabantu stole the show. She made a grand entrance at the Durban July in Greyville, KZN, on Saturday when she wore a black, see-through dress. The dress revealed her thighs and a bit of her bum. It was clear she was not wearing panties as her punani could be seen through the dress. At one point during the event, a group of men could be heard shouting: “Zodwa, you are ours!” Zodwa, who arrived with her Ben 10 Ntokozo Linda, spent most of her time outside the Afrotainment marquee posing for photos and videos. She later changed into a short dress that revealed her backside. “When I say I’m for the people, I mean it,” said Zodwa. “I don’t look down on others. I’m not arrogant. “When a person wants my attention I give it to them without hesitation. “I don’t view myself as an untouchable celebrity.” She said her dresses were designed by Nonkosi Collection and wearing no panties was her brand. “I wore this dress because I wanted to keep my brand alive,” she said. “I’m known as the woman who wears no panties. “I get paid for not wearing underwear and I spent most of my time in the Afrotainment marquee because that’s where the money was.”
