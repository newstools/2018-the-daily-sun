Tau Mohaka (49) of Zwelihle in Hermanus started selling fruit, chips and sweets in 2002 to take care of his family. The father of five said his wife takes care of the kids while he wakes up early every day to work at his stall. “Even though I focus on the selling side of my business, I sometimes do shoe repairs.” Tau said what he enjoyed the most was gardening. In his spare time, he visits local schools and plants spinach. “I love planting vegetables and working in the garden. “One day I want to get a piece of land where I can plant as many vegetables as possible to help feed people in need.” Tau told Daily Sun he was doing what he loved. “People my age struggle to get jobs but I don’t even want to try to apply for one. “I’m fine just here, doing what makes me happy.” Tau said he was thankful to everyone who has supported him from the beginning. “It’s not an easy job but at least I make enough money for my family,” he said. Tau said it was sad that some men still believed that only woman could become street traders. “They prefer to be involved in illegal things rather than to sell fruit in the streets. “They don’t realise how good it feels to sleep peacefully at night knowing you haven’t stolen the money you have,” he said. Mncedisi Ginya buys fruit for his kids from Tau. “Every day before my kids go to school I make sure I stop at Tau’s stall,” said Ginya.
