LAST month parents and pupils at Kwa-Faku Primary School in Philippi, Cape Town marched to the education department’s offices in Mitchell’s Plain. They demanded a new school. They complained about the old styrofoam building that was supposed to have been demolished last year. SGB member and parent Vuyokazi Songelwa said they were happy that the department had now finally kept its promise. “When we visited them last month they told us that the old building would only be demolished in October and we refused because we wanted the process to start while the kids were at home during the school holiday,” said Songelwa. She added that the old building was giving them problems because snakes and rats there put the lives of the kids in danger. “We are happy because the department also fixed the temporary structures so the rain doesn’t come in anymore,” she said. Parent Naki Daluxolo said they were relieved when they saw a bulldozer demolishing the school. Other residents saw an opportunity to take material like zinc and other things but that didn’t go well. Two of them lost their lives in the process. It is suspected that the two people fell through the roof last Friday. Their bodies were found in the building on Saturday. “It had been agreed that the doors, window and zinc would be sold by the SGB but some residents decided to do what they wanted,” said Songelwa. Daily Sun published a story on 8 June in which Western Cape Education spokeswoman Jessica Shelver said a new school would be ready by 2019.
