ZACHARIAH Manjase can fix any problem on a bicycle. This is why he’s called the bicycle doctor. The 38-year-old from Tembisa, in Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun that he started fixing bicycles back home in Mozambique when he was just 15. “I chose to fix bicycles because they are a very reliable form of transport. They don’t need petrol and can be used by anyone without a licence,” he said. Zachariah said he could fix anything on a bicycle, including the handlebars, brakes, and wheels. “It’s important to know all these parts and their functions,” he said. Zachariah said many bicycle parts could be fixed at home. For example, if you have a flat tyre, take out the tube, put it in water and put pressure on it to find the puncture. All you have to do then is clean the damaged part with sandpaper, put on glue and apply a patch. However, Zachariah said other parts needed to be taken to someone with experience like him. He said the challenges he faced were theft and rain as he worked in an open space. “Last year, thieves stole three bicycles. One was recovered but I had to replace the other two.” He said his dream one day was to have his own workshop. Zachariah’s customer Matlou Makibela said he had been taking his kids’ bicycles to him for five years to fix.
