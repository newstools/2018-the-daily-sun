THE IFP in KZN is walking tall after winning a ward that was previously run by the ANC in Mthonjaneni Municipality, Melmoth, in northern KZN. The IFP received 1 188 votes while the ANC got 1006, the NFP received 53 and the EFF got 30 in the by-election in KwaMagwaza Village on Wednesday. The numbers were confirmed by Thule Dlamini, the IEC supervisor in uThungulu region. Dlamini congratulated the IFP and its candidate, Psychology Ngema, for winning. IFP chairman Blessed Gwala said people realised that trusting the ANC was a big mistake. “They have corrected that mistake,” he said. Gwala urged people in KZN to vote for his party in the coming election. “We want to thank the residents of ward 7 in KwaMagwaza and urge them to vote for the IFP in the coming election. We don’t want to talk about next year because we don’t count our chickens before they hatch. We are asking people to continue trusting us,” said Gwala. The ward didn’t have a councillor after ANC Councillor Mthokozizi Mthembu was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison in February. He was bust in November with 11 stolen cows on his trailer. ANC KZN secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli said the conviction of their councillor was the reason the party lost the ward. He said Mthembu was also the secretary of a branch.
