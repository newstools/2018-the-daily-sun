NEWLY promoted Absa Premiership side Black Leopards have boosted their squad by signing Thabiso Mokoena and Nyiko Sibanda ahead of the start of new Absa Premiership season next week. A reliable source told SunSport that the duo had each signed a three-year contract with Lidoda Duvha, who host Polokwane City in their opening 2018-19 PSL Limpopo derby at Thohoyandou Stadium next Saturday. Sibanda, a defender (23), joined Leopards from Bloemfontein Celtic while 26-year-old midfielder Mokoena was acquired from National First Division side Mthatha Bucks FC. “I can confirm that these two players have signed with Leopards and are expected to join the team in Polokwane this week,” said the source. “Leopards have been looking for a central defender, as they believe it was one of the positions that needed strengthening. Nyiko can play in that position and is still young. “As for Mokoena, Leopards knew him from last season when they were still playing in the NFD. He is a good player and will add value to the team.” Other new signings include Khethukuthula Zwane, Lefa Hlongwane, Themba Ndlovu, Chris Matombo and Alton Kapinga. They seem to be adapting well, winning the inaugural Limpopo Soccer Legacy Spectacular at Giyani Stadium last weekend. Leopards fans seemed impressed by the new team that coach Joel Masutha has assembled. But Masutha is apparently in the market for more assets. “I don’t think they are done with signings,” said the source. “They will add one or two more players before the transfer window closes. But Masutha is happy and winning the Legacy match has increased player confidence ahead of the new season.”
