Mzansi’s most wanted cash-in-transit heist kingpin has been
arrested. He alleged was wanted by the HWAKS for murder, attempted murder,
possession of firearm, possession of explosives and possession of suspected
stolen property. The suspects, Willington Cenenda (39), was arrested in a
Crime Intelligence driven operation in Bloemfontein on Thursday. HAWKS spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said Cenenda
was wanted for a 2016 case where he and his accomplices were involved in a
shootout with the police. “A twelve member group were conspiring to commit a cash in
transit robbery in Mpumalanga.  Police
received information about a planned cash heist along the Delmas road and a
swift operation involving the Hawks, Crime Intelligence and the Task Force was
planned,” Mulaudzi said. He said the Task Force members intercepted the alleged
criminal group and a shootout ensued leaving three of the suspects dead and two
injured. One of the task force members lost his life in an accident
during the engagement. Several high calibre firearms and vehicles were seized. Cenenda appeared briefly at the Delmas High Court and will
be joining his other accomplices on 20 August 2018 whilst in custody. Further
investigations to link him to other cases continue. The Minister of Police, Minister Bheki Cele (MP) has hailed
the arrest of Cenenda as a major stepping stone in stamping the authority of
the law in South Africa. “We will as the South African Police Service continue to
ensure we put a permanent stop to the scourge of cash in transit crime.  It is our responsibility and mission to
protect and secure the inhabitants of the republic and their property and
ensure criminals are brought to justice. “We are very serious about turning the tide, we will not
rest until South Africans feel safe,” Minister Cele concluded.
