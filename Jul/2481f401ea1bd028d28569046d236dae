IT appears KwaMashu K section’s infamous whoonga boys have gone back to their parasitic ways. On Sunday, backyard toilet shower pipes and taps were stolen from several yards in the kasi, north of Durban. Residents said the shameless addicts sell the copper to scrapyards just for a fix. Hlengiwe Shandu (29) said they realised on Sunday morning there was no water. “I thought water cuts had started again, but when I went to the toilet I noticed the shower was gone,” she said. “I heard my neighbour’s outside tap had also been stolen.” Hlengiwe said they then realised the water supply had, in fact, been shut off by the shower-pinching social misfits. “This wasn’t the first time that the addicts had done this in our area,” she said. “ We didn’t report it to the police because we didn’t think it would make a difference. “We don’t even know which addict did this because our area is crawling with them.” Another resident said: “This is their way of making fast cash. These people do anything to get money. “Some steal wet clothes from the washing line to sell them. “But when people beat them, cops are quick to arrest residents.” KZN cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said people should report such cases so that, when items are recovered, they can claim them.
