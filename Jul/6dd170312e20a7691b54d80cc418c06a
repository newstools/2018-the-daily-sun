Actress and businesswoman, Petronella Tshuma has confirmed that she is with child. The Rhythm City actress took to social media this week to share the exciting news with her fans. "A mother's joy begins when new life is stirring inside...when a tiny heartbeat is heard for the very first time and a playful kick reminds her that she is never alone,” she said. Although she did let slip that the picture was taken by “daddy”, she hasn’t really opened up about who the father is. But if celebville is anything to go by, we will eventually find out. Just ask Jessica Nkosi how tiring it is trying to hide your baby daddy from the public. Anyway, check out the baby bump below: Camagu.
