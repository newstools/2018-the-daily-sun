NOMBULELO Sikade (44), from Mfuleni in Cape Town, is urging people to help to bury her neighbour. Nombulelo feels it’s her duty to make sure Siyabulela Sigaba (38), whose body has been in the mortuary since April, is buried next to his brother in Eastern Cape, who also died in Cape Town in 2009. Nombulelo told Daily Sun Siyabulela came to Cape Town from Mthatha in 2002. “He was my first neighbour. “I knew them since they were kids and am begging anyone who can help me with his burial to please come forward,” she pleaded. Nombulelo said she tried to get hold one of Siyabulela’s relatives but was shocked with the response she got. “The person I got in touch with was in Joburg and his response was that I must just let government bury him, because he wouldn’t do it,” said Nombulelo. She said Siyabulela’s parents died many years ago and she can’t just let him be buried by government because later on, he lived with her and she can’t let him down. “The kid trusted me and that is why I want to make sure he is buried in the Eastern Cape. “These kids struggled while they were alive and the least I can do is to make sure he is buried in dignity next to his brother. I can’t let them down.” She told Daily Sun Siyabulela suffered from TB and HIV. “There is no point in hiding what he was suffering from. I think he became sick because he defaulted on his treatment and died here in my house.” Nombulelo doesn’t know what to do to bury him and contacted Daily Sun for help. “I am hoping that after people read this story, they will help me.”
