GOGO Ntsoaki Rapitsi (56) went to the shops to buy spices for her husband’s favourite meal. Molefi Linoko (60) was sleeping inside their shack on Monday. But the madala never lived to eat the tripe he loved so much. Gogo Ntsoaki was left in tears after her husband burnt to death in their shack at Dipotomaneng kasi, Clocolan, near Ficksburg. Gogo Ntsoaki left a pot cooking on the paraffin heater stove when she went out. She told Daily Sun: “I wanted to surprise him by cooking his favourite meal. Since the tripe takes a bit of time to cook, I left the pot slow cooking on a paraffin stove.” Ntsoaki said while she was at the spaza shop, she saw a big flash coming out of her shack. “Local boys came running to tell me that my shack was on fire. “I tried to fight the fire but they were too strong,” she said. “I wonder what happened . . . my heart is broken and I miss my husband.” Ntsoaki said it will take her many years to heal. “He was the love of my life. We were hoping to spend the rest of our lives together.” Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said an inquest has been opened for investigation.
