AS A cold front continues to keep temperatures low in the Eastern Cape, these kids will at least have warm feet. Pupils of Empumalanga Primary School in Motherwell kasi, Port Elizabeth, yesterday received 1 100 pairs of shoes from Capital Land, the property company that manages Motherwell Shopping Centre. School principal Misumzi Pikoli said he was very happy with the donation as most of the kids came from poor families which depended on social grants. “This donation of shoes and school uniforms is a blessing to our school because the kids come from poor families. “Some kids were coming to school with bare feet while others had broken shoes,” he said. “Every child from grade R to grade 7 will get a pair of shoes and a school kit. This creates equality among the kids and gives them a sense of confidence, which helps motivate them.” Grade 3 pupil Sanelisiwe Klaas (8) said she was pleased to receive a pair of shoes and a school bag. “I live with my sister, who doesn’t work, so this donation helped me a lot,” she said. Capital Land said: “Motherwell Centre is committed to education and community upliftment. “Our programme Barefoot No More has developed a unique school shoe that can stretch to accommodate a growing foot while remaining perfectly comfortable. “The shoe is waterproof, doesn’t cause blisters and doesn’t need to be polished.” SGB chairwoman Nomthandazo Jack said the donation would help many pupils in the area. “I urge the beneficiaries of the shoes and kits to use them wisely.”
