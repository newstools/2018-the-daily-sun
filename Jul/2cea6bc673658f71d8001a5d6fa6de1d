A CUSTOMER was injured when two armed men robbed a spaza shop at about 7pm on Tuesday. A bystander was shot in one leg during the robbery at Save More Spaza Shop in Zwide, Port Elizabeth. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: “A 24-year-old suspect was arrested just after two men allegedly robbed a spaza shop. The pair started shooting at the shop owner, who tried to hide, and in the process a 25-year-old man was shot in a leg.” Beetge said the customer managed to run out of the shop and flag down a police vehicle. He said: “When police responded, two suspects came out of the shop running and with guns blazing. Police returned fire, but the suspects managed to flee between the houses. One of the suspects was found hiding behind a house in Bucwa Street. He was found in possession of a 9mm pistol with six rounds of ammunition.” The suspect was charged with illegal possession of an unlicensed firearm. The second gunman is still at large. “Further investigation will be conducted to link the suspect with the armed robbery and the attempted murder of the wounded man,” he said. “The suspect is expected to appear in the New Brighton Magistrates Court today.”
