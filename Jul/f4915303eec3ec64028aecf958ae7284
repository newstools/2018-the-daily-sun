A stolen bakkie that was loaded with cigarettes and a drop
safe containing an undisclosed amount of money was recovered in Verulam. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said
members of RUSA, were called out to a shop on Hazelmere Road in
Canelands after one of their suppliers was hijacked. Balram said it was established that three suspects who were
armed with firearms had held up the individual as he exited the store and was
in the process of removing stock from the back of the vehicle. The suspects then fled with the victim's bakkie in an
unknown direction. “Reaction Officers went in search of the bakkie and the
armed suspects and found the Isuzu bakkie abandoned at the Canelands
Intersection. The public pointed officers in the direction of an informal
settlement where the suspects were believed to be hiding,” Balram said. A RUSA helicopter was sent to the call and provided aerial
support to RUSA officers on the ground. Balram said an extensive search in the informal settlement
was conducted however the suspects remain at large.
