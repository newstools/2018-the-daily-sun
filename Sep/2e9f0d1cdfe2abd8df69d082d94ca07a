RESIDENTS of Mankweng in Limpopo are not happy with this caregiver. They claim the woman has turned Nobody Clinic into a spaza shop. A concerned patient recently captured the caregiver on video selling “special” tea bags that allegedly healed illness. The caregiver allegedly didn’t care about the long queue at the clinic, but only about her small business. “I don’t know why the caregiver was selling tea bags to us because we went there for medical attention,” said a patient (34) from Mamadimo Park Village. “We don’t want to wait in long queues while officials are pushing their personal businesses. We are tired of healthcare workers who don’t care about patients.” The caregiver was allegedly selling the tea bags for R10 each. “She stood there with the patients for more than an hour selling her tea bags,” the patient said. “I ended up complaining about her behaviour because the queue wasn’t moving. If she had concentrated on her job, the queue would have moved faster. “This is not a spaza shop.” The patient said she wanted the health department to investigate. Neil Shikwambana, a spokesman for Limpopo Health Department, said health workers are at clinics and hospitals to offer service to residents. “They are not allowed to do any other business except that which the department has employed them for. “We have also requested a full report on this matter from the district manager,” Shikwambana toldDaily Sun.
