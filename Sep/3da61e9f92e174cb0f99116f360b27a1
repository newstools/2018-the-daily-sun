EATING food grown in her garden has kept gogo Tryphina Dube healthy for more than 100 years. Gogo Tryphina from Dukuduku in Mtubatuba, north of Richards Bay, celebrated her 104th birthday last week. “When I was younger, I enjoyed eating maize bread and beans, which is why I started a vegetable garden. “I’d rather eat the fresh vegetables in my garden than the genetically modified food that causes illness,” she said. Gogo Tryphina said God blessed her with a long life because she was respectful. “I always tell my children, grandkids and great-grandchildren to respect people. “If they can do that, God will bless them.” Sipho Dube (57), the gogo’s son, said the family was grateful to God for keeping Tryphina alive. “We also have gardens because she told us to eat fresh food. I believe that’s what helped her become such a strong gogo.” Sipho said his mum loved to spend time with her grandchildren and great-grandkids. “My mum was blessed with three kids, but we have expanded the family by having our own children. “Now she has 36 grandchildren. “Seeing my mum happy brightens up my day. “I want to appreciate her while she’s still alive and thank her for all her teaching. “We have grown to be responsible adults because of her.”
