It looks like award winning Kwaito star Mzekezeke is making yet another comeback. He made an epic comeback this weekend at the Royal Heritage Festival, that took place at the Nandoni Dam in Thohoyandou, Limpopo. DJ Sbu, whom many believe to be the man behind the balaclava but still maintains he is not, took to social media to announce the news. This is not the first time MzakesMan will be making a return to the music scene after taking a break. In 2015, the star made his way back to the spotlight with new music after a three year absence. This time, there won’t be any new material from the masked musician, however, DJ Sbu has revealed that Mzekezeke is fully booked for this upcoming festive season. “21 shows booked for this festive,” DJ Sbu captioned a video on Twitter of Mzekezeke rocking a crowd at a recent event. “No hit song, no new music, no TV show, just the love. “It's amazing the power of a brand built 17 years ago still resonates with South Africans to this day, Namanje.”
