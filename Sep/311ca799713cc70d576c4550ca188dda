THE arrival of Bonginkosi Ntuli at AmaZulu is seen by the club’s last season’s top scorer Mhlengi Cele as a healthy challenge. Ntuli joined Usuthu two weeks ago on loan with an option to buy from Mamelodi Sundowns. The striker is expected to make his second appearance in Usuthu’s colours this afternoon against his former team at Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium (3pm). Cele, who scored seven league goals in his first season at the club, says he welcomes Ntuli’s arrival at the club. Said Cele: “The addition of another striker shows that the coach [Cavin Johnson] is serious about winning. “Everyone knows that you can’t win without goals and it’s our job as strikers to score goals. It also means competition. Everyone will be competing for his place and also use that chance. “Every striker will work hard in making sure they score those goals. That will see the team win. It’s good for the team,” he said. AmaZulu have played four matches and Cele has already opened his goal account after scoring when Usuthu beat Free State Stars 2-1, the club’s last match before the two-week Fifa break. Cele is looking to continue where he had left off when the team host Sundowns this afternoon. He said as much as they are playing at home they will be considered as underdogs. “This is going to be a tough one and to be honest, we’re looking forward to it. The way we see it, we’re going to this match as underdogs and pressure will be on them [Sundowns]. They’re a big team and everyone will be expecting them to win. “What pushes us to do well in this match is the fact that we haven’t lost at home so far this season and are going there to keep that run. “In short, we’re going there to win.” Cele added. Cele and the other new striker for the club, Emilian Tade, are the only two forwards who have scored. The likes of Mabhuti Khenyeza and Siyabonga “Bhele” Nomvethe, who scored last season when Usuthu beat Downs in this match in Pretoria, are also expected to line up for game time this afternoon.
