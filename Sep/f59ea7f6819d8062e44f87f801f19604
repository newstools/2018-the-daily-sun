Explains Mkhathini: “He has opened an assault case. He filed the case immediately after the incident. Makhathini said Ngwenya was doing his job, reprimanding two Sundowns supporters when they invaded the pitch after the match. An altercation between Mosimane and Ngwenya then ensued.“And Pitso allegedly punched him,” Makhathini explains.Mosimane denies punching Ngwenya and says he told him not to treat their fans like criminals as he was allegedly dragging them off the pitch.Said the coach: “Look, two of our supporters went on the pitch and the guy (Ngwenya) dragged them off like criminals. He should have marshalled them nicely off the pitch because they were not resisting.“This thing of people manhandling others must stop. This guy (Ngwenya) wanted to be on TV, get seen by his family.“But there were no punches thrown. The guy was trying to be smart and I tried to help him. I refused to stand for such things but there were no punches.”KwaZulu-Natal Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that a case has been opened against Mosimane.PSL spokesman Lux September said: “I heard about it (the incident).
