ACE Magashule and other ANC members were in Parys, Free State to fulfil their promise to renovate the house of Stompie Seipei. It was handed over to his mother Mananki Seipei in a low key event yesterday. She was happy to receive it. The ANC secretary general also said Mananki will have DStv paid for in her house for three years. He said she would also get R1 500 worth of groceries every month from Spar. Magashule vowed to continue to meet former party leaders, including former president Jacob Zuma. He said he didn’t owe anyone an explanation. “There’s no reasonable leader of the ANC who can plot against another leader,” said Magashule. “I don’t know what I must explain. Meeting Zuma is not a sin.” Magashule committed to working with Ramaphosa just as he had worked with Zuma and former president Thabo Mbeki. “We will work for this ANC and nobody will take us out,” he said. “Even if people insult me I will just work harder.” Magashule also weighed in on Mbeki’s criticism of the party’s resolution on the expropriation of land without compensation. He said they respected Mbeki’s views, but said every loyal member should accept the decision taken at the national conference at Nasrec. “Why are we afraid to amend the Constitution so it makes things clear?”
