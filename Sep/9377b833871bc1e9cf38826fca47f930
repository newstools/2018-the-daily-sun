EVERY month the school is robbed. In May four computers and two towers were stolen, and the thugs came back for more in June and July when they stole from the principal’s office and the administration building. Every time the thugs broke doors and ceilings to get their evil hands on the loot. Now Dumani Primary School has decided to leave the doors and windows unlocked so that when the thieves come, at least the classrooms will be left undamaged. School staff have resorted to making sure that nothing of value stays behind in the classrooms. The school’s principal, Simpiwe Mkhangelwa, said there wasn’t much left to steal as criminals have taken computers, printers, chargers, window panes and water pipes. “The computers stolen were specialised computers programmed with Maths and English subject software meant to benefit pupils from grades five to seven. Mkhangelwa said he removed the few computers left for safekeeping, and would only begin using them after upgrading the security system. Councillor Sandile Nzanzeke said community members should protect schools and other public infrastructure because they benefited from them. “If people stop buying stolen goods, crime will stop. I will engage the community to revive street neighbourhood watch patrols,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said cops were using all avenues to investigate and arrest the thieves. “A case can only be taken to court if fingerprints from the crime scene match or if a description matches a suspect. We also make arrests when a suspect is found selling stolen goods.”
