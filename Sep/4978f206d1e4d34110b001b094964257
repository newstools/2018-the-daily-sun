THEY looked happy, but things were different behind closed doors. The couple spent three years without poking. They both said the spark was completely gone and the man said he was no longer sexually attracted to her. But all of this is in the past now. Michelle and Poloko Mankurwane walked down the aisle at the weekend. They thanked prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng for bringing back their spark. The wedding was led by Mboro in his church in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. Michelle (33) said: “I’m glad I didn’t give up on him, otherwise I would have lost the man of my dreams.” Michelle started dating Poloko (43) in 2006. They have a six-year-old daughter together. They said it was love at first sight when they met. But things turned sour when Michelle fell sick in 2015. “He slowly began to keep his distance from me. It was sad and painful,” she said. “He did not get an erection when I wanted us to have sex and we eventually stopped trying. “Things got worse as we no longer touched and kissed. We were unable to communicate our feelings. “I wanted to give up because I felt there was no point being together. But I decided to approach Mboro for help.” Michelle said after Mboro prayed for them, hardly a week later things began to improve and it didn’t take long before Poloko proposed. “Days later, we started cuddling and had sex. Mboro is our hero,” she said. Mboro said: “It’s not easy for people to talk about sexual problems. They cried out for help and, as their spiritual father, I prayed for them as well as their bedroom.”
