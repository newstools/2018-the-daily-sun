RESIDENTS were horrified when they found a woman’s body on Monday morning. It later emerged she had been raped! A resident accused four men last seen on Sunday night with the woman in Mamelodi East phase 1, Tshwane. The resident told residents and cops she had seen the men dragging the victim. Residents wanted to kill the men but cops rescued them. The woman’s body was found by a passerby near a railway line. Resident Morwesi Tsenkeng (27) said: “What were they hiding? Had the woman who saw them not come forward, they’d never have confessed to having been with her.” Another resident, Matsobane Langa (32), said no one knew who the victim was. Captain Michael Mbewe said: “An inquest docket was opened and the four men were taken in for questioning. “Statements were obtained from them and we’re still investigating.”
