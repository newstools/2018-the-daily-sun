THE Moretele Park Tribute Concert was supposed to be one of the year’s biggest parties. However, the festival, which took place in Tshwane over the weekend, ended up being a disaster when three of the headline acts didn’t pitch! Daily Sun reported yesterday that Sjava, Amanda Black and Sun EL let down their fans when they didn’t show up. Sam Mhangwani of Drakensberg Promotions said he paid more than R200 000 to book the three artists but none of them took to the stage as planned on Saturday. Sam said the artists didn’t perform because they had been double booked. He wants his money back. “I will be left with no choice but to take the legal route if they don’t pay back the money.” Sam said the three had no excuse for not showing up as he had paid them in full before the event took place. Sam said Amanda and Sun EL demanded to perform at their own times, which had not been agreed to. He said Amanda refused to perform after midnight. Sun EL’s manager Mosima Serakalala said he was at the event but had to leave for another gig as the promoter kept on pushing his performance time back. “We are arranging for Sun EL to perform at another one of their gigs to repay the money,” said Mosima. But Sam said he would not settle for anything other than a refund. Sjava said he didn’t know much about the issue as he only focused on singing. “I don’t care about who says what about me. “I only focus on my music. I don’t book gigs,” he said. When asked for his manager’s contact details, Sjava said he was busy. Attempts to reach Amanda were fruitless.
