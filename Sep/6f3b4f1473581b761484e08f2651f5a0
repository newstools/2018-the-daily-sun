GETTING a birthday gift is always special. But for Nolizwe Mbebe (44) from Mqhekezweni Village near Qunu, the gift she received on her birthday from Eastern Cape Human Settlement MEC Mlungisi Mvoko would be difficult to beat! “I’m struggling to make a living,” said Nolizwe. She said her family was living in a one-roomed mud house that was damaged by heavy rain last year. “This is heaven. Now we won’t stress when it’s raining and windy,” she said as she received the keys from the MEC. “We thank the department and our councillor Sandla Tokwana for identifying us as beneficiaries.” Mvoko also handed over two other houses to elderly people in the area. Phakamile Zinge (98), who lived alone in a mud house, said: “From now I will be safe in my house.” Gogo Nomva Mhlana (90) said her children had abandoned her. “I thank the Mandela government for my house. I also thank our chief Zanomthetho Mtirara,” gogo said. Mvoko also handed over two more houses as part of a 400 unit housing projectplanned for Qunu.
