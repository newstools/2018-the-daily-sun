A DESPERATE mum who sold her six-week-old baby bust herself
after confessing all to her pastor. According to Punch,
Miracle Johnson (23) from Anambra, southern Nigeria sold her infant, Greatness,
to an orphanage for N200 000 (about R8 110) two weeks ago. Part of the cash Miracle used to buy a cellphone. She explained she had sold her child because her husband
was struggling to support her and their first born child. Miracle said a woman called Mama Joy had persuaded her to
sell Greatness. “Mama Joy said that since my husband was not taking care
of me, if I did sell the baby I could give the money to my husband to start a
business or buy a motorcycle,” said Miracle. Soon afterwards she was overcome with guilt and remorse
and told her pastor what she had done. She said: “I told my pastor what I had done and that it
was a mistake for which I would never forgive myself. So, my husband and I went
to a police station to report it. “I know what I did was not good. I pray that my child
will forgive me.” Cops said she’ll be charged soon in court.
