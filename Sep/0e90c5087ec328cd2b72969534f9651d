FOLLOWING the shooting of a taxi boss and his cousin on Wednesday, passengers now fear for their lives. Commuters at Wema Taxi Rank in Durban said they were worried that the killing of Sihle Zulu (36) and his cousin Quality Sikhakhane (35) would start a taxi war. The two were apparently ambushed and killed while sitting in Zulu’s car. A 38-year-old taxi passenger said she was walking towards the taxi rank when she heard gunshots. “I heard people saying two men had been shot and killed,” she said. She said she was shocked when she got to the rank and saw two dead men in a car. Another passenger (45) said this could be the start of more shootings as there could be revenge attacks. “We are not safe because when shootings take place, passengers get involved. We hope they will be able to handle this matter peacefully,” said the passenger. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a taxi owner and his cousin were attacked by a group of armed men. “The suspects opened fire, fatally wounding the two before fleeing the scene on foot,” Gwala told the People’s Paper. “The victims were certified dead at the scene. Charges of murder were opened at Montclair Police Station.” Zulu’s uncle Xolani Manyoni (46) said the family wanted cops to arrest the suspects. He said his nephews were clearly victims of a hit. Durban Line Taxi Association spokesman Bongani Mhlongo wouldn’t comment.
