LAST week, Daily Sun published a story about Sipho’s love for the paper. In 2003, he bought a copy of the People’s Paper for 80 cents and was hooked. Since then, he has never missed a copy. But Sipho Mahlangu (42) is now worried about the rumours spreading about him. Rumours are rife in his kasi of Mandela in Hammanskraal, northern Tshwane, that the father of two does not love Daily Sun. Some people claim he uses the paper as an excuse to avoid poking. But Sipho wants to set the record straight. “I’m a stallion in bed,” he told the SunTeam. Sipho said those who say he’s afraid of poking should ask his wife. “I’m always up for action. “My wife sometimes complains that I want it every day and should give her a break,” he said. Sipho said he would continue to buy the paper no matter what people say. Newspaper seller Milli Modisakae (30) said she keeps one paper for Sipho every day. “I never make the mistake of selling all the copies. “Daily Sun is his Bible. I’m afraid he will get sick if he does not read it daily.” She said people who said he was avoiding poking were just jealous. “He shouldn’t focus on them. Reading is healthy.”
