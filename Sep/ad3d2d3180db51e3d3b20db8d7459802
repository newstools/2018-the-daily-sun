The Democratic Alliance’s front runner for the premier of
the Eastern Cape has been announced. The announcement was made by DA leader Mmusi Maimane on
Wednesday during a media briefing in Port Elizabeth. The man selected for the premier race is no stranger to
politics. Nqaba Bhanga (41), a KwaZakhele, Port Elizabeth native,
started his political career while still in high school. He served as the regional chair of the Congress of South
African Students (COSAS), and in university he became the ANC youth leader and
the Student Representative Council (SCR) president of the then-Port Elizabeth
Technikon. He also served as the national secretary general of the
South African Student Congress (SASCO). Bhanga joined COPE and was served as a COPE MP before
joining the DA. In 2017, Bhanga was elected the DA’s Eastern Cape Provincial
Leader. “Spearheading the DA’s battle for this crucial province,
Nqaba will carry on his shoulders the responsibility of building on this recent
growth and offering the people of this province a realistic alternative to the
ANC government,” Maimane said. Maimane also said that Bhanga would have his work cut out
for him if he is elected the premier. “There is no time to waste. If ever there was a province
that bears the scars of years of corruption and neglect, it is the Eastern
Cape,” he said. “Mud schools, bucket toilets, dry taps and a health system
that borders on dysfunctional paint a picture of a failed province that has
been bled dry by the corruption of the failed ANC. “The Eastern Cape has the highest unemployment rate in the
country, at 35,6%. If you include those who have given up looking for work, a
staggering 46% of the province’s people are unemployed. That is 1 in every 2
people,” he said.
