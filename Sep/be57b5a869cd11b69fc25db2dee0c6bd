Two SRC leaders at Ehlanzeni TVET College in Acornhoek, Mpumalanga have been suspended. The two are threatening to take steps if their suspension is not reversed. They were told to leave campus on Monday after they called on students to boycott classes over delayed NSFAS payments. But SRC secretary Steven Mona and president Mandla Madonsela said they had been suspended without valid reasons. “Management didn’t want to hear our voices when we raised issues. Instead they went on to hire security guards to intimidate us,” said Madonsela. He said they encouraged students to go back to the classes. College council chairman Lucky Mbuyane said management was worried about the performance of the students and urged them to listen and improve their poor marks. Acting CEO Maria Maraise said she had already requested extra funding and they would also speed up the process to address the issue of water and toilets.
