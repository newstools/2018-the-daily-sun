THE South African Masters and Legend Football Association have expressed deep sadness at the passing of the South African football stalwart Reggie Jantjies. Jantjies, the former 1980s and early 1990s Cape Town Spurs and Hellenic midfielder, died from illness in Cape Town on Wednesday. He was regarded as one of the best footballers to have emerged from the Western Cape and South Africa. “He was one of the greatest footballers this country has produced and he was a proud member of the South African Masters And Legends Football Association,” said SAMLFA president Buddha Mathathe. “We wish the family strength during these trying times. A football legend has fallen. It is a great loss not only to the family, Cape Town football fraternity and SAMLFA, but to the whole country. “This is a sad reminder that former professional football players are still subjected to the same apartheid conditions, not being fully appreciated for the immense contribution they made towards football development and the democracy we enjoy today.” Jantjies, the former SAMLFA Winelands Regional chairperson, was involved in youth development coaching in his hometown of Stellenbosch and was quite passionate about unearthing fresh talent. He was also the head coach of the Maties soccer club at Stellenbosch University up until recently. Cape Town City boss John Comitis said they will honour Jantjies during the seventh minute of their league game against Kaizer Chiefs at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday.
