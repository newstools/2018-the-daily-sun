THE bodies of the five zama zamas who tragically died in a rockfall last week were found in open veld yesterday near Angelo squatter camp in Ekurhuleni. Fellow zama zamas apparently went underground to collect the bodies. “We can’t let them rot underground,” a zama zama told Daily Sun. On Friday, the dead men’s families each donated R4 000 so that a zama zama rescue team could buy proper gear including safety lights, masks, ropes and body bags. The rest of the money was for paying sangomas to cleanse the miners who retrieved the bodies. A leader of the zama zamas rescue team said they had retrieved bodies before. “Their families are happy. We don’t want to rely on anyone,” he said. “We have several people whose families haven’t found closure because their bodies are still underground, in spite of cops and mine rescue teams getting involved.” Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the dead men were brought out of an old mine and dumped next to the squatter camp. “The cause of death is unknown and inquest dockets were opened,” he told the People’s Paper. “We don’t know who left them there.” Police are calling for anybody with information to call their nearest police station or 08600 10111.”
