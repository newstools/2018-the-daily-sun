COPS in the Northern Cape bust a bakkie driver with drugs valued at R8 million. This was after police K9 unit in Calvinia stopped the suspicious looking bakkie as it was on its way to deliver Mandrax to the Western Cape on Thursday. The driver thought he could fool the cops by wearing a uniform and claiming to be a courier driver. Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock said: “Police in Calvinia stopped a major drug shipment. “A 27-year-old man was arrested and charged with possession of drugs after 81 000 Mandrax tablets were found stashed in six boxes. “The driver was allegedly from Gauteng en route to the Western Cape. “The drugs were intercepted after police spotted the courier’s bakkie at a petrol station in Calvinia. “The bakkie was searched and police found the drugs stashed in six boxes. “The drugs are estimated to have a street value of over R8 million. The bakkie was also confiscated.” Provincial commissioner of the Northern Cape, Lieutenant-General Risimati Shivuri, praised police for the bust.
