A SUSPECTED drug dealer is in hot water after thinking he could outrun the cops. The suspect tried to flee on foot after police received a tip off about him transporting mandrax tablets on Saturday in Kimberley. Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock said Kimberley police, crime intelligence and tactical response units received information that a man was at a hiking spot with drugs in his possession. Cops found the man as he was about to board a truck on the R31. He tried to run into the nearby bush but cops caught him. Kock said: “A 58-year-old man was arrested and charged with drug dealing. This is after 478 mandrax tablets were found in his jacket. “The drugs have an estimated street value of about R30 000. The suspect will appear in court soon.”
