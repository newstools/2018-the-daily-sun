Kaizer Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung has thrown his support behind coach Giovanni Solinas, claiming that he is a perfect fit for the club. Solinas, who was brought in late in the off-season to replace Steve Komphela, got life at Naturena off to a less than ideal start, failing to win any of his first five Absa Premiership matches at the club and crashing out of the MTN8 semi-finals against SuperSport United.However, Amakhosi have since recovered with three straight victories, and Motaung is confident that their recent success is a sign of things to come."The players are responding very well so far, according to what we see. They are responding very well to the philosophy, which has been the Chiefs way, and the energy the person brings to the club," Motaung said onRadio 2000's Marawa Sports Worldwide."The man is a hard worker, which is positive. For me, he reminds me of some old coaches which we used to have, who are workaholics."He's a Chiefs coach that fits the style of play that Chiefs wants to play, so I think given a chance and the spirit that the team has now, we can see good things coming."The Glamour Boys will be hoping to continue their winning run when they resume the league with an away encounter against Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium on 2 October. -SPORT24
