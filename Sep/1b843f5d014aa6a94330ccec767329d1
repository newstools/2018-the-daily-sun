RESIDENTS of Dobsonville, Soweto are gatvol and refuse to go another day without electricity. They blocked roads with stones and burning tyres to protest about the electricity being cut off. One of the residents, Sizwe Mofokeng, told Daily Sun the community was not informed about any load shedding that would be taking place in their area. “We buy electricity and for Eskom to just send officials to switch the lights off is disrespectful to us,” said Sizwe. “The company claimed that some people bridged their meters, while others are using fake electricity vouchers. We don’t work for Eskom so how are we supposed to know if the electricity is fake?” He said sick people and people with babies had to find alternative accommodation because it was hard for them to cope without power. “We run businesses that are suffering. Food in our fridges is rotting. How are mothers supposed to cook for their kids? “Before they do an external audit and switch off our lights, they should check their employees. “ They are the ones who connect people illegally and even sell them the buy-one, get-one free electricity. We want our lights back or this road will remain closed.” Eskom said on Wednesday, the Soweto Energy Protection team and Jamazi contractors were performing disconnections in Dobsonville Extension 3 when community members chased them away. Two Eskom employees and two contractor employees were held hostage. Eskom security and law enforcement agencies were sent to the scene to rescue the team. After negotiations with the community, the employees were released but the area was left with no electricity.
