WHEN they were kicked off their land, they went to the local royal house. And when democracy came to Mzansi and land claims were opened to those who had lost their land during apartheid, they lodged a claim. However, the Baja Boswa ba Barberspan from Barberspan, near Delareyville, North West, are still waiting. All they can do is watch while the land which is rightfully theirs lies empty and is rented to strangers. Community members told Daily Sun they asked the local royal house, led by kgosi Noto Moshoete of the Borolong Boo Raseitshiro, to help with their land claim, only to receive a nasty surprise. The claim was successful but it ended up being registered to the Barolong Boo Raseitshiro, based in Madibogo. The Baja Boswa ba Barberspan elders told Daily Sun they were very angry about the situation. Thomas Makaota said: “The land was wrongfully and fraudulently registered to the Barolong Boo Raseitshiro instead of the real and direct beneficiaries, Baja Boswa. “We are not happy that we cannot access the land and use it. Some of our farms are leased out without our consent or benefit.” The elders claimed the land commissioner in the North West was frustrating the process of returning the land. Isaac Moshoete of the Borolong Boo Raseitshiro said they didn’t know anything about the matter. Land reform department spokesman Frank Lesenyego said the farms were placed under administration due to allegations of maladministration within the Community Property Association. He said most of the work the department wanted done was complete and administrator Khanyisa Mogale would convene a general meeting to elect a committee.
