JP DUMINY has revealed that the Proteas will not be available for the start of the new T20 league competition, which gets underway in November. The inaugural T20 league will run from 9 November to 16 December, which means that the Proteas’ ODI squad will not be available for the start of the tournament. The Proteas travel to Australia to play in three ODIs and a sole T20 international – with the T20 scheduled for 17 November. Speaking at the Cape Cobras’ season launch yesterday, Duminy admitted that some Proteas players could miss the T20 competition. “If I go to Australia, I’ll be one of quite a few guys who’ll miss the first two weeks of the new competition,” said Duminy. Originally called the T20 Global League, the tournament was scrapped just weeks before it was due to be launched at the end of 2017. Although scheduled to get underway in November of this year, Cricket South Africa (CSA) has been running into stumbling block after stumbling block along the way, with SuperSport pulling out as CSA’s equity partners in the event.
