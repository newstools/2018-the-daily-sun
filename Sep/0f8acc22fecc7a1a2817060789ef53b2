Opposition parties are baying for the head of minister for Women in the Presidency, Bathabile Dlamini. This is after the Constitutional Court found that she had tried to mislead the court. The DA will lay charges of perjury against her, and the IFP has asked Parliament's Speaker Baleka Mbete to establish an ad hoc committee to probe the Sassa, CPS tender scandal and to look into Dlamini's fitness to hold office as allegations of corruption, fraud and money laundering pertaining to the CPS tender emerged. DA leader Mmusi Maimane has also written to President Cyril Ramaphosa, asking that he fires Dlamini and Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba from his Cabinet. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court of Appeals found that Gigaba also lied to the court. In his letter to Ramaphosa, Maimane referred to the High Court's finding last year in relation to former president Jacob Zuma's firing of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister, that constitutional decisions must be rational, including the appointment of ministers. "We respectfully submit that, as much as it is irrational to appoint a manifestly unsuitable person to the Cabinet, it is equally irrational to retain such a person in the Cabinet, especially when the Constitutional Court and the High Court has made the pronouncements that they have. For that reason, we earnestly request that you discharge these two members from your Cabinet and act to defend the integrity of the Executive," Maimane wrote. "Failure on your part to do so by 5 October 2018 may result in the DA embarking on similar litigation referred to above." In December, the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria found that Gigaba had "deliberately told untruths under oath". The court also found that he had violated the Constitution.
