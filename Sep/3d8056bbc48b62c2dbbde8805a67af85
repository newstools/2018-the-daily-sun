A LFRED Mabaso was having fun dancing at the tavern in the early hours of Saturday morning when things suddenly got ugly. The 22-year-old from Mogoba, near Daveyton in Ekurhuleni, accidentally stepped on another patron’s white takkies, which led to his horrific death. The other man allegedly went home to fetch a steak knife and stabbed Alfred to death as he was leaving the tavern. Albert bled to death in the street. When residents heard about the incident, they went to the suspect’s shack and found him lying in bed. They dragged him out and stoned him before handing him over to the police. He was taken to hospital under police guard. Constable Justice Ramaube said the 30-year-old suspect and the victim were drinking at a tavern when the fight broke out. A patron told the SunTeam: “It was just a mistake that Albert stepped on this man’s takkies. The tavern was packed. Albert’s mum Rosette was devastated. “We were sleeping when his friends came to knock on our door to tell us what had happened. We rushed to the tavern and found him in a pool of blood,” she said. “Alfred was young and hoping to achieve things in life, but now he has been taken away from me. I hope the man who did this pays dearly.” Ramaube said a murder case was opened at Putfontein Police Station and the suspect will appear in court once he had recovered from his injuries.
