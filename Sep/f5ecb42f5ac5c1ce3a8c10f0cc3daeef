RETHABILE finds comfort in athletics. Blind marathon runner Rethabile Taunyane (35) from Matatiele in the Eastern Cape, is a six-time Comrades marathon competitor. He began running in 2001 and said athletics releases his stress. “It brings me joy and happiness. It protects me from the evils of life and lifts my spirits. It also helped me gain confidence,” said Rethabile. He’s participated in the Old Mutual Two Oceans marathon once and last week he took part in the 21km Old Eds Road Race where he received two medals. He’s busy preparing for the Mandela marathon taking place in Pietermaritzburg next Sunday. He pleaded with anyone to sponsor him with R3 500 for accommodation and transport. He said he started as a short distance runner when he was still a teenager. “I was a member of Hlathindlela KwaMashu club. Now I’m with Rockies runners club in Joburg.” He said he prepares for the marathons by going to the gym. “I spend one hour on the treadmill and spinning. Alternatively I’m on the street and run without the assistance of a guide,” said Rethabile. He’s won about 50 medals from different races and his dream is to compete in the New York marathon that takes place in November. One of Rethabile’s challenges is running gear. He said he uses the same takkies for training and participating in marathons. Rethabile said he was thankful to his fellow runners who were sighted as they guided him during races. He was born blind and attended school at the Blind Society in Durban, KZN, where he learnt how to write and read Braille.
