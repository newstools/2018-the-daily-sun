AFTER a thrilling titanic battle between skilful local pugilists, Thabiso “The Rock” Mchunu and Thomas “Tommy Gun” Oosthuizen, at Emperors Palace in Joburg on Saturday, SA boxing fans might have to brace themselves for another clash of the local titans. The cruiserweight adversaries were battling out for the African Boxing Union (ABU) title, with comeback kid Oosthuizen winning on points. The lanky fighter has now taken aim at Mchunu’s stablemate, International Boxing Organisation cruiserweight world champion Kevin “Two Guns” Lerena. “I’m glad to be back with Golden Gloves. I feel blessed to be back with my coach, it’s been a while since I competed. Everything is good, you know. God is good to us. There is no doubt that we are moving forward,” Oosthuizen said. “By the grace of God I’m moving up, I’m living a clean life. There is no doubt that I will keep myself together. I am in a good place in my life. “I will be climbing the ladder and my next opponent will be Kevin – who knows what the future holds. That is why we fought Mchunu first to get to Kevin, we want to be world champions. God willing, that fight will take place next year,” he added. Talking about their contest against Mchunu, the 30-year-old boxer said: “Thabiso is a scientific boxer and is also very smart. It was a tit-for-tat game, I was quickly in and out, he had me thinking on my feet. He is a really competitive guy.” In the main supporting bout, Ryno Liebenberg easily cruised to a fifth round knockout victory over his local rival and friend, Alfonso Tissen, to win the vacant ABU super middleweight crown. Unheralded Michael Mokoena, meanwhile, shocked the boxing fraternity when he sent the favourite, Lusanda Komanisi, to the canvas in the fourth round to be declared the winner of their lightweight clash.
