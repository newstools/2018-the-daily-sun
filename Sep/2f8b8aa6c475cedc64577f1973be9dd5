The high court has dismissed Athol Trollip and the DA's application to set aside Mongameli Bobani’s appointment as Mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay. Judge Elna Revelas also ordered that the DA and its partners were to pay the costs. The court said that Mbulelo Manyati, the DA councillor who chose to abstain during the motion of no confidence against Trollip, was still a DA councillor until he chooses to resign. Trollip was removed by the ANC, EFF and UDM as mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay in August following a motion of no confidence. Three days after his ousting, Trollip and his coalition partners – Cope, the ACDP and the Patriotic Alliance – lodged an application seeking urgent review. News24 reports that Advocate Dali Mpofu represented the opposition coalition in the High Court, arguing that the DA made a "miscalculated decision" to leave the council meeting before it had concluded its business of the day. He said walking out of a meeting is a strategy used popularly across political spaces, but those walking out needed to ensure there was no quorum thereafter.
