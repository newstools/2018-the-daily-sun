THEY have burned the field and even sprinkled chemicals but the big scary rats just won’t go away! The rats even scare children in the area. Instead of playing outside, the children hide from the rats. Onica Khumalo of Saulsville in Tshwane said the abandoned bush where the rats live should be cleared. “I want the bush to be cleaned and developed because big rats hide there and they scare our children. “The rats disturb the little children at my daughter’s creche as well as people passing by.” She appealed to the Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga to do something about the land, which has become a breeding space for the rats. She said people have started dumping rubbish in the area and that was attracting even more rats. Onica said if the mayor can’t do anything she will turn the bush into a park. She said the municipality shouldn’t abandon areas like these. Msimanga said the municipality would clean up the area and turn it into something productive. He said they were in the process of auditing municipal and government land.
