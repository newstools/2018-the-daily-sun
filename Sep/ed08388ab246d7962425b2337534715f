STRONG wind destroyed hundreds of houses in Maokeng kasi, near Kroonstad in the Free State, at the weekend. Although they are homeless, residents said they were happy to be alive. Several cars were also damaged and the electricity supply was affected. Mantsho Tiedi (29) said she and her family had a lucky escape when their roof collapsed and destroyed furniture and everything they owned. The jobless mother of two appealed to government to help her family. “I’m still shaken because we narrowly escaped death. We will be fine if we are assisted with a roof. We lost everything,” said Mantsho. Ntibi Tsunke (51) said the wind left his family with nothing. “We were sitting in the kitchen when a strong wind started to blow. The roof was blown off,” said Ntibi. “We ran to hide under tables. I lost everything, the furniture is ruined and I will have to buy new things. I share this house with my children and we pray that it doesn’t rain,” said Ntibi. Moqhaka municipal speaker Mpho Chakane said: “More than 200 houses were affected. Roofs were blown off by the strong wind, leaving many families homeless. “We are going to look for assistance from the district municipality and all spheres of government.” Co-operative Governance MEC Oupa Khoabane said the provincial government would assess the situation and help affected families. “The incident left two people in hospital after they were hit by flying corrugated iron sheets.”
