SHE was crowned Miss South Africa in May. Now Tamaryn Green (24) is giving Daily Sun a glimpse into her journey over the past three months. Speaking to the SunTeam in Cape Town yesterday, she said: “My life has changed dramatically. Being Miss South Africa comes with a lot of responsibility, but it is also about being proudly South African and representing your country.” When asked what her average day looked like, she said every day was different. “Women’s Month, for instance, consisted of speaking at various events, especially on empowering women. The job changes every day and you have to embrace everything that comes your way.” She said young women could be whoever they wanted to be. “We are all different. You need to find what makes you unique and use it to make a success of yourself. Don’t try to be someone you are not. Don’t compare yourself to someone else,” said Tamaryn. She said she had embraced being Miss South Africa. “I have taken that responsibility. I do whatever I have to do to the best of my abilities,” she said. Tamaryn said speaking to her parents over the phone when she was away helped her a lot and she had learned to manage her time well.
