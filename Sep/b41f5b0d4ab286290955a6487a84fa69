SPAZA shops have left communities divided. Some residents are begging spaza shop owners to re-open, while others say they must leave! The SunTeam spoke to shop owners who re-opened their shops. “They begged us to re-open. Gogos can’t go far to buy headache tablets and bread,” said an owner who operates in Snake Park, Soweto. The shop owner said even though they lived in fear, many of their customers needed them. “We’ve been here for five years and are treated as part of the community. Gogos told us not to be afraid and continue offering good service. “I agree that some of the food that was in my shop had expired, but it has since been removed and we will only be stocking fresh food in future,” said the owner. Washington Mbatha (67) said he was not impressed with the looting. He wondered why, if the food had expired, people took it to feed their families. “It’s a sign of poverty and criminality. If they really didn’t want the food, they would have packed it in the van along with the owners and chased them away,” he said. A landlord said she was a pensioner and depended on rent from the spaza to send her granddaughter to university. “I need that R4 500. No one wants to rent this space for what I charge. It’s not like they were planning to open businesses after chasing these people away. Foreigners give us credit and we pay at the end of the month,” she said. Some youths from White City, Soweto, admitted to looting. Sandile Mazibuko (28) said:  this was because they came here to take money to their country and not create a single job“The foreigners are selfish and only look out for each other. “They have made ikasi their home but some of them are arrogant.”
