TO protect the environment, the uMhluthuze Municipality has been planting trees. Residents and pupils were told of the importance of planting and protecting them. The event happened on Tuesday at Sitholinhlanhla Primary School in Richards Bay, northern KZN, as part of the World Arbor Week celebrations. Deputy mayor Dudu Sibiya and municipal speaker Slondile Mkhize were joined by other officials and representatives from companies such as Mondi and Foskor, which operate in the city. Sibiya said the day was special to them as their office was situated between industries which polluted the air. “It’s important to go around to various places in our municipality to teach them about the importance of planting trees. “It’s also crucial that we encourage residents to plant trees in their homes and at schools and churches. “This will help fight pollution and save the environment for the next generation,” said Sibiya. She said they would ensure trees were planted throughout the year and not just this week. “We’ll visit schools and various areas to teach them the importance of having trees in their yards. “We also want to teach pupils never to destroy the environment. “We want the cutting and burning down of trees to end. “We know with knowledge a lot can change,” she said. Hlengiwe Mvubu, a manager at Mondi, said they supported the initiative because they cared about the environment. “Our methods of processing trees to papers and furniture are environmental friendly,” she said. Grade 5 pupil Phindile Mthembu (10) of Sitholinhlanhla Primary said she learnt that trees provided her with fresh air and some provided essential nutrients. “I’ll tell my parents to plant trees for me so I can look after them and protect the environment.”
