A SISTER and a brother who had kids together have been arrested
and the children removed. According to news.com.au, the two had been living as man
and wife on a remote family farm in New South Wales, south Australia. Cops have given them fake names to protect the identity
of the kids, calling them Martha Colt (38) and her brother Charlie Colt (age
unknown). They were found with five kids between the ages of 11 and
20, but cops are still investigating whether they are all the product of sex
between Martha and Charlie. In 2012, cops first bust 38 members of the Colt family
living on the farm, many of the siblings allegedly having sex with each other
or even the kids. Several children were removed at the time. Cops swooped on the farm and other places members of the
Colt family lived for a second time in April. Siblings and nephews of Martha and Charlie now also face
charges of sexual intercourse with children, indecent assault and incest. Cops say the five kids are in a bad way. They have hardly
any education, were dirty and didn’t know how to do things like brush their teeth
or use toilet paper when they were found. Many of them also have twisted facial features and walk
strangely, probably because of genetic problems resulting from incest. Martha is in a women’s prison in western Sydney. On
Wednesday, she applied for bail. The Colts are unlikely to face trial until late 2019.
