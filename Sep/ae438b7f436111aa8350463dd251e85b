ANOTHER cash-in-transit robbery took place on Friday, and CCTV footage captured what almost looked like an action movie. The footage shows four armed robbers disguising themselves as municipal workers before pouncing. Police chased the robbers and one of them paid with his life. The CCTV footage taken at a petrol station in Florida, west of Joburg shows a guard stopping to collect bags of money. When the guard tries to board his armoured truck, he is attacked by the robbers. The thieves shot of one the truck’s wheels to make sure the guards could not follow them. They fled the scene in two vehicles, but police were hot on their heels. When cops caught up with the robbers in Dobsonville, Soweto, a shoot- out took place. Residents who witnessed the gun battle said they ducked for cover. “I heard gunshots and ran into the house,” said Bonisiwe Ndaba (36). “A helicopter was hovering metres above our houses. It was very scary.” Police are on the hunt for the three robbers who got away. Police Minister Bheki Cele commended the officers for reacting swiftly.
