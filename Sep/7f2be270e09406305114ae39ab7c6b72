BAFANA Bafana coach Stuart Baxter says bringing in his son Lee as goalkeeper coach for the national team is the best decision in a difficult situation. Lee, who is Kaizer Chiefs’ goalkeeper coach, was brought in to replace Andre Arendse, who is currently attending to family matters. Bafana are in Durban preparing for their second Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Lee is expected to sit next to his father on the bench and Baxter senior has praised his son, saying he’s the right man for the job. Said Baxter: “I will be massively disappointed and surprised if there are any reactions about bringing in Lee. “I didn’t bring him on board for the sake of having someone next to me. He is the most qualified man for the job. I had to act fast after Andre pulled out at the last minute to be with his sick wife.” Baxter said he expects nothing less than victory in their match against Libya on Saturday. He explains: “Libya are a very good team but it is a match that we have to win. I don’t expect anything less than three points in this match. We will be prepared – I know what to expect from them. “Winning this match will help us take control of our group. We’d like to take charge of this group as early as possible. I don’t want it to go down to the wire.” Bafana arrived in Durban yesterday and had their first training session at KwaMashu’s Princess Magogo Stadium. Bradley Grobler and Dean Furman did not train after they suffered knocks in SuperSport United’s 1-0 win over Chiefs in the MTN8 semis on Saturday.
