IT WAS six days after their deaths that the bodies of
five family members were discovered at their suburban home in Perth, Australia. And the man accused of killing three generations of one
family is none other than the dad of the three children. According to news.com.au, Anthony Robert Harvey (24) was
yesterday charged in court with the murder of his daughters, twin girls Alice
and Beatrix (2), and Charlotte (3). He is also charged with killing their mum
and his partner, Mara (47), as well as Mara’s Mum, Beverley Quinn (74). It seems Harvey fled north after killing them as he
finally turned himself in at Pannawonica cop shop on Sunday afternoon, a town
more than 15 hours drive away from the quiet Perth suburb. In his court hearing yesterday, it was heard that blunt
objects and knives were used to kill the five. Mara and the kids were allegedly
murdered on 3 September, and gogo Beverley the next day. Mara’s shattered sister, Taryn told news.com.au: “There
are no words to explain the emptiness and loss that we are feeling. This world
is a sadder place with the loss of these five beautiful people but heaven has
gained five new angels.” Bewildered neighbours also expressed their shock at the
family bloodbath. Doug Roberston told news.com.au: “I didn’t see the kids
often but I could hear them playing. I just can’t believe this has happened.” Alfie Campos, who lives behind the family’s house said: “I
would always see the kids playing and I would shout out hello to them. “The grandma was there every single day helping out and
the dad had some lawn mowing business and was always in and out. “They have lived here for about four years and were
always very friendly.”
