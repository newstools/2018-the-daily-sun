LIMPOPO director-general Nape Nchabeleng has come to the aid of special schools. This comes after reports that many of them were on the verge of collapse and underresourced. Some of the schools are said to have been neglected by the department of education for over five years. Conditions at the schools, according to the reports, pose a danger to pupils living with disabilities or those with special needs. The resource, infrastructure and staff audit will help in ensuring that none of the 34 special schools is neglected. Suzan Phala, the DA’s acting spokeswoman for quality of life and status of women, youth and disability, welcomed Nchabeleng’s commitment. She said they would monitor progress. Limpopo Education spokesman Sam Makondo acknowledged that there were infrastructure backlogs. “The work is going on to address these historic challenges because we’re aware of all the challenges,” Makondo told the People’s Paper.
