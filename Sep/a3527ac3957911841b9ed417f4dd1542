DESPITE the late withdrawals that have disrupted their camp, Bafana Bafana midfielder Kamohelo Mokotjo believes there is enough firepower to overcome unknown Libya in their Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday (3pm). The latest withdrawal is striker Lebo Mothiba, who plays for Strasbourg in France. The injured Mothiba was quickly replaced by Bidvest Wits forward Mxolisi Macuphu. His withdrawal follows that of Themba Zwane, Hlompho Kekana and Bongani Zungu, who were replaced by Vincent Pule, Tiyani Mabunda and Aubrey Modiba. The trio had their first training session at KwaMashu’s Princess Magogo Stadium yesterday. Mokotjo, who plays for Brentford in England, said the spirit in camp was high and everyone was looking forward to their second qualifier. The 27-year-old from Kutloanong Location in Odendaalsrus said they would rely on home ground advantage to boost their chances of qualifying for Afcon 2019 in Cameroon. “We had a few minor setbacks in terms of players withdrawing due to injury but I believe the ones who were called in know what is expected of them,” said Mokotjo. The ex-FC Twente star made his Bafana debut in 2012 and earned 11 caps in four years before his shock retirement in 2016. He stated at the time that circumstances were not conducive for him to break into the Bafana lineup. But he came back into the fold last year after the appointment of Stuart Baxter and is ready to help the national team qualify for Afcon 2019. Bafana last competed in Afcon in 2015 in Equatorial Guinea. “It is an honour to be back in the team,” he said. “I will perform to the best of my ability.”
