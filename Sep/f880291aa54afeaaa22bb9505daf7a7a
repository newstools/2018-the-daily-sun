The
Western Cape Government has committed R100 000 reward for information about the
latest violent attacks on Metrorail train. The
Western Cape MEC for transport and Public works Donald Grant said, through the
Department of Community Safety, the money will be rewarded to anyone who
provides information to the police which results in the arrest and successful
conviction of those responsible for crime on the Cape Town rail system. He
further expressed disappointment at the South African Police Service, he said
there is an urgent need for criminal prosecution against perpetrators of
violent attacks on Metrorail train. Grant
was extending his condolences to the family and loved ones of the man who has
lost his life following the attack that happened between Lynedoch and Eerste
Rivier on Friday. Another
commuter was reportedly seriously injured and eight more commuters were robbed
of their belongings. “I
wish to condemn this latest attack in the strongest terms,” said Grant. He
said: “The Western Cape Government has partnered with the City of Cape Town and
PRASA on various initiatives aimed at improving safety over the last few years.
We hope that these initiatives will result in improved safety conditions for
the thousands of commuters that rely on the service on a daily basis. “While
we are optimistic about these efforts, I remain disappointed at the South
African Police Service’s inability thus far to investigate these incidents of
criminality effectively, and to successfully prosecute and convict those
responsible and place them behind bars,” said Grant. He
said these matters have been raised with the highest level of the SAPS
management on a regular basis. “We
have requested that the police make a commitment to prioritizing rail crime,”
said Grant.
