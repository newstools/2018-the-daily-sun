LEON Adams left the country more than 38 years ago to join Umkhonto weSizwe. His name appears on the list of MK members who died in exile, but no one is willing to help his family find his remains. According to his family, his friends said he was killed and buried with soldiers from Mzansi. His wife Matilda Crowder (78) said her son was just a baby when her husband skipped the country. “After Leon left we kept in contact. Then he suddenly stopped writing,” said Matilda. “I tried to trace him. I understand he was arrested somewhere in Botswana. “When I contacted the prison in Botswana, I was told he was released and left for Zambia. “Unfortunately, there is no trace of him arriving in Zambia. “Whoever has the power to exhume my husband’s remains must do so.” International relations spokesman Ndivhuwo Mabaya said: “The family should write to the president and to the ministers of defence, international relations and justice.”
