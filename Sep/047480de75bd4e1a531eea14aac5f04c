Rapper Cassper Nyovest, real name Relifiloe Phoolo and TV and radio personality Thando Thabethe are living their best lives in Italy. The Mzansi duo along with Nigerian superstar WizKid, are ambassadors of Ciroc and they currently in Milan doing some work for the brand. They have teamed up with Italian fashion house Moshino and have been sporting the brand throughout their time in Italy. They even attended the Moschino runway show at Milan Fashion Week and had the pleasure of sitting in the front row. And of course, the two have been sharing pictures from their wonderful time in Milan on social media. “I’ll never forget how we had our very first convo,” Thando captioned a picture of herself with Cassper as she started to reminisce. “We were at icon I worked at Y at the time, you were trying to get noticed and begged me to find out how one can get their music on the radio. “I myself was doing graveyard at the time, working 3-6am weekdays and shooting a sitcom which I landed after thousands of auditions! “Here we are years later, in Milan living out our dreams!!! All is within our reach!!! I love you my friend.” Check out their pictures below: ?A BIG LION FROM AFRICA WAS SPOTTED IN MILAN LAST NIGHT!!!! #MufasaInMoschino ? A post shared by  Refiloe Phoolo ????
