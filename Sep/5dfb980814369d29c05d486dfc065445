THE National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) says new car and light commercial vehicle sales, have been disappointing. Naamsa however said, export sales have recorded a welcome improvement. New vehicle sales are at 47 964 units, showing a decline of 1 234 vehicles or a fall of 2.5% compared to the 49 198 vehicles sold in August last year. According to Naamsa, the collective export vehicle sales are at 32 247 reflecting an improvement of 2 317 units or a gain of 7.7% compared to the 29 930 vehicles exported in August last year. “Overall, out of the total reported Industry sales of 47 964 vehicles, an estimated 38 795 units or 80.9% represented dealer sales, an estimated 12.5% represented sales to the vehicle rental Industry, 3.7% to industry corporate fleets and 2.9% to government.” Naamsa says the August, 2018 new car market is at 31 447 units, it registered a decline of 722 cars or a fall of 2.2% compared to the 32 169 new cars sold in August last year.

Sustainable economic growth was essential to support the creation of new employment opportunities. Urgent steps were needed to address South Africa’s structural problems including skills shortages, general productivity, deindustrialisation and low fixed investment growth. The recent sharp depreciation of the Rand exchange rate would exert upward pressure on general inflation, as well as on new vehicle prices,’ Naamsa said. The association said the sharp decline in the latest Purchasing Managers’ Index was a source of concern and suggested a continuation of challenging business and trading conditions during the months ahead.
