WHEN gogo Tsatsawani Chauke (66) heard her goats bleating in the kraal in the middle of the night, she suspected something was wrong. “I was fast asleep in bed on Friday night when I was woken by my goats bleating outside. When I went to investigate I couldn’t believe my eyes. I saw three men carrying them. I shouted at them to stop what they were doing, but my plea fell on deaf ears as they ran away with my animals,” said gogo Tsatsawani from Gunda Tshilate Village, outside Thohoyandou. She told Daily Sun the thieves had parked a bakkie on the street a few metres away from her home. “As I was about to chase them I saw a white bakkie parked on the street. They put my three goats in the back of the bakkie and sped off,” she said. Gogo Tsatsawani said she lost five goats last month. “All my goats were locked in the kraal before I went to bed. When I woke up in the morning I discovered that five goats were missing. “I didn’t think the thieves would still come back for more. My heart is broken because these goats were my wealth. I sell them to the villagers to make money to support my family of five.” Ximambana Mbhokota (38) also lost goats to thieves. He told the People’s Paper: “Two weeks ago, seven of my goats were stolen at night. “I went to bed that night knowing very well that all my goats were safe in the kraal. “But in the morning I found that some of my animals had gone. I reported the matter to the cops, but no one has been arrested. “I appeal to the cops to arrest the thieves because they are killing our business.” Limpopo police spokesman Moatshe Ngoepe said: “We encourage villagers to participate in the community-based crime prevention initiative. “It includes a neighbourhood sector forum and the community policing forum. This will help to prevent this kind of incident from taking place in the future.”
