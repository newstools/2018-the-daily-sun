This gospel singer’s dream came true after she was hospitalised. Zimbabwe-born singer Lindi “Lindi Marc” Marcellus said she always wanted to be a gospel musician. She had to put her dream on hold to focus on being a wife, mum and businesswoman. Lindi said she got a wake-up call in 2015 after she survived a horror car crash. Speaking to SunBuzz, she said: “While I was in hospital, my husband promised to find me a studio and producer as I had almost lost my life before I could make my dream a reality.” Lindi, who moved to Mzansi in 2008, released her debut album Vhurai Nzira in November last year and plans to release her second album on 9 November. She said she was excited. “This is the first album I will launch in South Africa. South Africans loved my first album, so I hope the response to this one will be the same,” she said. “I thought pursuing a gospel career in South Africa would be easy. “I thought making money here would be a breeze, but it wasn’t. So I stopped trying and started looking for a job.”
