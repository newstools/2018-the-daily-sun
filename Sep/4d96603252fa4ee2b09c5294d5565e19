DEPUTY President David Mabuza said the disappearance of money meant for school toilets in Mpumalanga must be investigated. This came after DA MP Jacques Julius yesterday raised the issue during a question and answer session in the National Council of Provinces in parliament. Mabuza was accused of being involved in the theft of money from the provincial education department when he was premier. Julius said: “Some people are sabotaging projects but nothing happens to them. You go and source funds for toilets and someone else steals it. “Do you agree that when it comes to you, parliament investigations must include an investigation by the committee on public accounts of large scale misappropriation of funds from Basic Education to finance your own personal political party interest, as alleged by the New York Times newspaper? “The money that was allegedly stolen by you was meant to build those toilets.” Mabuza called for the investigation to take place. “Any investigation that will help us discover the missing money is welcome. We welcome any investigation,” he said. Mabuza said government was working to rope in the private sector to raise funds for toilets. “The funds contributed by the private sector will be administered by the national education collaboration trust to make sure it is used correctly,” he said.
