SHE calls herself uBabe we HIV and shares the naked truth about living with the virus. Lebogang Motsumi, an HIV positive activist and entrepreneur, recently told Daily Sun she had dedicated herself to educating young people to prevent them from making the same mistakes she did. The 29-year-old from Parktown in Joburg said she almost died before she accepted her HIV status and started leading a happy life. She said she was only 17 when she was infected by her boyfriend, a well-known singer who has since died. “We had sex without a condom because no one spoke about it. I feared pregnancy more than HIV because I thought it only affected older people,’ she said. “I thought I couldn’t have it because I was young, beautiful and chubby. I associated it with people from poor communities and thought they looked skinny with their hair falling out.” Lebogang said even after the man who infected her had told her the truth and died, she didn’t believe she could have HIV. Three years later, Lebogang met a new man and he insisted they go for an HIV test after the condom they used burst. “I started taking my medication because it was the right thing to do, but I didn’t understand the importance of it. “I later joined a church where the pastor claimed he could cure the disease and stopped taking my medication. “I got very ill and was hospitalised for six months and was bedridden,” said Lebogang. She said after she almost died, she decided to become involved in activism to educate young people about sex and HIV. “I came up with the name uBabe we HIV to bring attention to the topic and break the stigma around the disease,” she said.
