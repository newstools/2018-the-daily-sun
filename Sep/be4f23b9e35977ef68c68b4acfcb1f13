RECKSON Mkansi is angry with his relative. He said the woman stole his money after lying and saying she’d help his son (19) get a driver’s licence. The 46-year-old from Allandale Village outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga told Daily Sun: “My son wanted to get a driver’s licence and his mum recommended a relative who owns a driving school in Bushbuckridge. “The relative wanted me to pay R10 700, but I only promised to pay half so that my son could start the driving lessons. “I deposited R5 000 into her bank account on 27 February this year. “We agreed that the balance would be paid once my son got the licence. She wanted my son to test for a code 14 driver’s licence. I told her he was still young for that code and we should wait until he turned 21. But that’s when the trouble started.” Reckson said the woman was now ignoring his calls because he wanted his money back. “I just want my money back because my son didn’t get any help.” Driving school owner Joyce Duduzile said her business hasn’t been doing well. But she promised to pay back the money. “I intend to pay my brother-in-law as soon as I get the money.”
