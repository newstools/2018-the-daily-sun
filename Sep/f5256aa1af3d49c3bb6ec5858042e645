A SANGOMA was busy with a client when a man walked in and claimed he could help the woman for R20! Sangoma Rethabile Dillane (39) didn’t argue with the self-proclaimed sangoma and the woman gave him the R20 he wanted. But when the man bought booze with the money, Rethabile swore at him. The fake sangoma tried to stab him but instead killed an innocent resident. Residents of Caleb Motshabi kasi in Mangaung, Free State, then attacked the fake sangoma and burned him to death on Sunday. Rethabile told Daily Sun: “We were shocked when we saw the man buying beer with that money. “He said he could only cure people when he was drunk. “I got angry and swore at him for disgracing the ancestors.” Residents warned him a few minutes later that the drunk wannabe sangoma wanted to stab him. “He stabbed a kind and innocent man who was trying to stop him,” said Rethabile. “Residents attacked the fake sangoma. They poured petrol over him and set him alight. “I was resting my head on the chest of the man who died because of me. “My ancestors saved me, but an innocent person died in my yard and that hurts. I immediately did a small ritual.” Colonel Thandi Mbambo said Kopanong cops were investigating two murder cases. Mbambo told Daily Sun: “At about 8.30am, a 57-year-old man was trying to stop a fight when he was allegedly stabbed by a 27-year-old man. “Residents grabbed the 27-year-old and set him alight. No arrests have been made and we urge anyone with information to call Warrant Officer Kgotso Thekiso on 063 692 1192 or the nearest cop shop.”
