THE people of Daveyton finally have an official race of their own! Residents of the East Rand township and surrounding area will celebrate the Heritage Day long weekend in style on Sunday by taking part in the inaugural Mayfield Square/Daveyton Hearts Athletics Club (DHAC) 10km Challenge and Street Mile. There will also be a 5km fun run/walk for those who just want to shoot the breeze but still be part of the shindig. After attending almost all the races in Gauteng as well as some of SA’s biggest races such as the Comrades, Om die Dam Ultra Marathon, and Two Oceans, the DHAC members are very proud to be organising and hosting runners from other areas and clubs. Thulani Mvelase is one of the casual runners who will be running his first ever official race. “I have bought my race ticket and I’m excited about doing my first ever 10km. After this, my next step is to join the Daveyton Hearts club and become a member. I kept hearing about this club here in Daveyton but did not know where and how to reach them. “This race on Sunday will help and I am looking forward to the day and to interact with the members. “I am hoping that more people and casual runners from the community will come out and show support,” he added. The club’s communications department expects about 2 000 runners on race day. “Our club has grown over the years. This is a community club that reaches all corners of Daveyton and have members from all over Ekurhuleni’s townships, Kwa-Thema, Tembisa, Vosloorus, Tsakane and Katlehong. “We are happy that Mayfield Square has partnered with us as main sponsor. With them on board, we will attract more people. “We will be giving away prizes too.”
