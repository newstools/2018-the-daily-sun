THE Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union has reached a settlement agreement with AngloGold Ashanti. This follows months of negotiations in the ongoing gold sector wage talks. Yesterday, Amcu announced it had reached a settlement with the mining company, which tabled an offer close to what its members want. The union headed into the negotiations with a mandate from its members of achieving no less than a R1 000 increase on basic wages. Anglo is giving workers an increase of R1 000 a year over the three-year agreement. Other demands achieved by the union included four months paid maternity leave for women employees. AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa said this showed what a union can do in all sectors. “We are here to make a difference to the lives of workers and impact their livelihoods positively,” he said.
