A HOLE that was dug in a gravel road is making life difficult for motorists and villagers. The road connects the residents of Mshaya Village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, to nearby villages. The residents said it was better to drive on a muddy road than on a road that damaged their cars. They claimed their ward councillor dug up the road with a grader and left a huge hole in May. They have demanded a tar road in their village. Resident Nkosi Mazibuko (28) claimed their councillor told them he would fix the road so it would no longer be slippery when it rained. “We hoped we would be able to use the road but our excitement was shortlived. Our councillor left a few days after the hole was dug up and never came back,” he said. Another motorist, Phumzile Gumede (41) said they were now forced to choose between using a road which posed a danger to them and using a much longer route. “We can’t get hold of the councillor to tell him to come back and finish what he started. Every time we call him on his cellphone, he hangs up on us. When we go to his house, we don’t find him,” said Phumzile. Zakithi Zwane (25), who uses public transport, said taxis refused to go on the road as they feared damaging their vehicles. Daily Sun contacted the councillor, Fisokuhle Mpanza, several times yesterday but his cellphone rang unanswered. An SMS was sent to him but his cellphone went to voicemail soon afterwards. Mtubatuba municipal spokesman Mdu Mahlinza promised to investigate.
