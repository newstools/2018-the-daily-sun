weight loss choice. I'm proud of it!” Sophie also noted that diabetes is a silent killer. “Some people sadden me because I have lost both my
parents through Diabetes I nursed them so I know this killer disease. It’s
real. No joke,” she said. “Our fellow sisters and brothers commit suicide
because of pressure of what you negative heartless people think. “I stopped worrying what any negative person thinks
long ago. I'm fighting it daily to live for my children and family.”
