INMATES from Pietermaritzburg Prison in the KZN Midlands are happy to have won a reading competition. The event took place at Westville Prison on Thursday and Friday. The winners will now represent KZN at national level next month. The event is part of the Funda Mzansi campaign, which encourages a culture of reading and writing. Inmates read books by local authors such as Insumansumane by Elliot Zondi and Dog Eat Dog by Niq Mhlongo. They also took part in a debate and spelling competition. Inmates from Pietermaritzburg walked away with eight trophies. They were followed by prisoners at Eshowe and Qalakabusha prisons, who won five trophies each. Mbalenhle Dlamini (34) from Pietermaritzburg Prison scooped first prize for reading in Zulu. She said she was glad she had been given a chance to change her life. “This opportunity gives me hope that change is possible. I hope this inspires people not to repeat the same mistake I made in life. For me, preparing for the competition was a walk in the park. I spend most of my time reading. I hope to make everyone in the national competition proud,” she said. The competition was organised by the department of correctional services. The winners will take part in the national competition in the Western Cape from 1 to 5 October.
