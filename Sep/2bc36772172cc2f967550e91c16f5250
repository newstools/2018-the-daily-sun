AFRICAN pumpkins grow best in the villages where the soil is dry. And an old woman says these traditional vegetables keep her healthy. Nwa-mdunwazi Gudu (71) of Makuleke village, mixes the pumpkins, known as kwembe, with home-made maize meal to prepare the special meal of tshopi. She peels the pumpkin, chops it up and boils it in a pot. And when it’s cooked, she stirs it until it’s thick and adds sugar. Nwa-mdunwazi from Makuleke Village in Limpopo cooks and sells tshopi to tourists passing by her village on the way to the Kruger National Park. Gogo Nwa-mdunwazi said: “I have been a local farmer for more than 40-years. I have been selling african pumpkins to the local people and tourists visiting Kruger National Park.” Nwa-mdunwazi charges local people R10 for a small pumpkin and R50 for a big one. She also grows and sell tomatoes, spinach, cabbage, onions, okra and Chinese cabbage. “My customers come from as far away as Matiyani, Maphophe, Makahlule, Mhinga and Josefa village,” she said. One of her customers, Mamayila Chauke, said: “We used to travel long distances to buy pumpkins and vegetables, but now we walk only a few metres to Nwa-mdunwazi’s farm to buy enough vegetables to feed the whole family.”
