NTSOAKI Matsobane (50) from Thokoza, Ekurhuleni, said this week that the municipality has failed her. She said her house burned down early last month after work done by the City’s electricians. “We had a power outage in the area. Electricity was fixed and everyone ekasi had power, except us.” She said she called the municipality to alert them about the issue. “A team was sent and they fixed the issue, but less than three minutes after they left a fire broke out and damaged our house,” she said. Ntsoaki lives with her daughter and grandchild. They have now been forced to move into their garage, which was unaffected by the blaze. “My granddaughter, who is four years old, has stopped going to preschool because she doesn’t have clothes to wear. “We have lost all our documents and have been trying to get things in order, but it’s taking too long.” She said their backrooms were rented out but were so badly burnt no one wanted live in them anymore. Ntsoaki said no one in the family worked and the rooms were their only source of income. “I’ve done everything the municipality said I should do for the claim to be processed. “It’s been a month and no one but the councillor has been here. “How are they going to investigate the matter from their offices?” Ward councillor Desmond Sabi said he has tried everything to speed up the process. “These things take time. Investigations still need to be done on whether the fire was caused by the municipality or not,” said Sabi. Municipal spokesman Themba Radebe confirmed that the City had received the claim. “As part of the necessary claim-handling procedures, it was forwarded to the City’s insurers. The insurance part of the process is underwritten by external insurers.” Radebe said they would give Ntsoaki feedback once the insurance company got back to them.
