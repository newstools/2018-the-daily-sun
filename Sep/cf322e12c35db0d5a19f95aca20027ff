SIX Ingonyama VIP security guards have been bust for hijacking and extortion. The guards allegedly accused a private taxi owner of ferrying pupils without a permit. They then allegedly took his car and demanded money. He went to open a hijacking and extortion case against them. Captain Pearl Van Stad of the Brakpan cops, in Gauteng, said: “The victim told us his taxi was confiscated because he was not a member of the Benoni Taxi Association.” She said when he parked his car at Putfontein Primary School hey accused him of transporting passengers though he has no certificate from the association,” said Van Stad. The suspect was instructed to go with them to the taxi association’s offices in Benoni, where he was allegedly told to pay a fine of R10 000 to get his vehicle back. “The victim could not afford to pay the money. He did guarantee to pay them R3 000,” she said. “The guards were angry about this, but he was still told to pay the R3 000 and the remainder in instalments to get his vehicle back.” The cops arrested the heavily armed guards from their Benoni office and confiscated their firearms. They had three R5 rifles, three pistols and a number of magazines and rounds of live ammunition with them. Van Stad said they were charged with hijacking as they allegedly took the vehicle by force. Investigations are still underway. The suspects will appear in the Benoni Magistrates Court soon.
