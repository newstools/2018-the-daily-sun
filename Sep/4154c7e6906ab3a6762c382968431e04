THE IFP has expressed sadness following the killing of its councillor in uThukela Municipality in Ladysmith. Zakhele Mazibuko (44) was gunned down on Saturday night on his way home from a party meeting in Estcourt. IFP national spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa said they were still in shock. He said they didn’t want to speculate on the motive for his killing but couldn’t rule out political motives. “We’ve chosen to leave everything to the police to do their work,” he said. Mazibuko’s killing came just days before the Moerane Commission of Inquiry’s final report into political killings was presented in the Legislature on Thursday. He is the second IFP councillor to be killed this year and one of many politicians killed in KZN since 2011. In May, IFP PR councillor Sibuyiselo Dlamini was shot dead on the main road in Ulundi, also in northern KZN. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Mazibuko was travelling on the R74 near the Cornfields’ turnoff when he was ambushed. A murder case was opened at the Estcourt Police Station.
