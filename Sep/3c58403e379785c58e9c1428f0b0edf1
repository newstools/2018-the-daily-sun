WHEN they were told a contractor had been hired to build RDPs for them, they were overjoyed. But four years later, residents of the Kennedy Road squatter camp in Durban are still living in overcrowded shacks with no basic services. Area committee member Siyabonga Gumede (38) said the situation was very bad. “There is nothing as painful as being given hope that things are changing, and then to see that nothing happens,” he said. Siyabonga said when they were told about the RDPs at a community meeting in 2014 they thought their lives would improve. “We were told the contractor and land surveyors had given the project the green light. We were even shown photos of what our houses would look like,” he said. Siyabonga said there were more than 5 000 shacks in the area, with overcrowding the biggest issue. “Our wish is to get the houses we were promised so there can be fewer shack dwellers in the area,” he said. He said even if not everyone got a house, they would appreciate it if anything happened. Mandla Nsele, eThekwini acting spokesman, said the project was going ahead and it would have two phases. RDPs would be built at Springfield in Clare Estate. “Feasibility studies and town planning layouts have been prepared for low-income housing,” Nsele said. “Kennedy Road’s will be implemented in August next year and will be completed by August 2021.” He said 225 residents would benefit from the Kennedy Road project and 45 would benefit from a Dodoma Avenue One project.
