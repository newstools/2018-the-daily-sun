It is no secret that singer and songwriter Kelly Khumalo has not had it easy when it comes to romance. The Asine hit-maker  has been in multiple public relationships with none of them ending well. To say she has been unlucky when it comes to relationships would be an understatement, but that has not deterred her. The 33 year-old has previously expressed her desire to dive back into the dating scene, but this time, she aims to put herself first when getting into a relationship, something she hasn’t always done. Despite Kelly’s well documented romance woes, the star claims for some reason, people seem to think she has it all, and should not be single. "Everybody goes through things but somehow it becomes taboo when Kelly goes through it,” she told her bestie Thami Dish on Touch HD. “You are even afraid to say, 'I'm actually single' because everyone is gonna think, 'Kelly you have it all. You are beautiful, you are talented' and I'm like 'uh ah.'" In a previous interview with Thami, Kelly described the kind of person her next partner must be. “I’m not looking for a young boy, I’m looking for a man, who will be able to stand up to this woman that I’ve become; a woman who knows what she wants and what she represents."
