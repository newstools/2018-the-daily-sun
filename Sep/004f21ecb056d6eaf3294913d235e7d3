RESIDENTS of Pienaarspoort extension 11K in Mamelodi East have been waiting to get permanent stands for 20 years. They said they are tired of being fed empty promises by the City of Tshwane. Community leader Humphrey Khorombi (41) told Daily Sun: “We need development and permanent stands. “In 1999, the municipality promised to give us serviced permanent stands. We’ve been waiting ever since.” They were growing impatient. “Shacks are falling over and we’re tired of repairing them.   Our children live in darkness and struggle to study at night,” said Khorombi. “We don’t want to protest and shut down everything, but we’ve had enough.” Another community leader, Kgothatso Chukudu (23), said: “As the youth we need libraries, sports facilities and jobs.” But mayor Solly Msimanga said: “The City has a programme which has identified pieces of land that belong to the municipality and other spheres of government. “There is land that has been procured for the informal settlements of Mahube, Alaska and Skierlek. “We’re in the process of township declaration and starting the process of bulk services and allocation.”
