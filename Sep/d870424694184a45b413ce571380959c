The Premier Soccer League have called a meeting for Thursday to discuss utterances allegedly made by Black Leopards chairman David Thidiela towards referee Victor Hlungwani over the weekend. According to reports, threats and accusations were directed at the match official after Leopards lost 1-0 to Bloemfontein Celtic at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday. The PSL has responded to allegations made against Thidiela of threatening a match official with violence. "The National Soccer League (NSL) has become aware of the alleged utterances which appear to have been made by David Thidiela," a statement read. "The League distances itself from any comment or utterance such as that which has been reported. Black Leopards is a member of the league, and both the club and Mr Thidiela are bound by the NSL Handbook. "If the reported utterances are true, this would contravene the League Code of Ethics. Mr Thidiela has been afforded an opportunity to respond to this matter and provide such information as may be relevant." The PSL confirmed that the matter would be heard before the Executive Committee and Board of Governors at a meeting called for Thursday, 20 September. The Black Leopards boss in the audio can be heard making threats of violence and tribalist utterances against the referee. "Where I am playing please don't come, I donâ€™t have a problem with anyone, but we can do without you Hlungwani. "Don't come here (Thohoyandou Stadium), you come here at your own risk, I am giving a last warning, I am tired of you."
