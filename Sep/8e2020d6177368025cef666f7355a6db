WHEN Sydwell Ngozo first saw a drunk man wearing religious clothing and preaching, he just knew he was trouble. His suspicions turned out to be true . . . He got home later that night and saw the man stealing his dog. But the 51-year-old from Wattville, Ekurhuleni, got an even bigger shock when cops helped him find the dog. She had been raped by the evil man! Sydwell told Daily Sun the incident, which happened earlier this month, left him sad and disgusted. He said the dog rapist arrived at KwaNhlanhla Tavern earlier that day dressed in church uniform. “When he came in, he started prophesying. He bought drinks and started telling us he needed new friends. We didn’t entertain him,” said Sydwell. When Sydwell later went home and got into bed, he heard his dog barking. “I went outside to investigate and saw the same man,” he said. “He had untied my dog and was running away with her.” Sydwell said he called Actonville police, who were on patrol in the area. “They came to my house and took a statement. They found the guy with my dog the next day,” he said. When he went to feed the dog after getting her back, he noticed she was bleeding from her swollen backside. “I realised my Steffie had been raped,” said a fuming Sydwell. He called the cops again on the man, but he was released because he was mentally ill. Seun Mahedi from the Benoni SPCA advised Sydwell to report the man to the nearest police station.
