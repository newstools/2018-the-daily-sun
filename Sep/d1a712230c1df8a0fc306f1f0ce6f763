“HE JUST went on shift when it happened. We are hurt as a family”, said Marilyn Hartzenberg. Her 21-year-old son, Jason, is believed to be one of the people who died during the explosion that killed at least eight people at the Rheinmetall Denel Munitions plant in Somerset West on Monday afternoon. “We don’t know what really happened. “We are still waiting for management to explain,” Marilyn (44) said. Rheinmetall Denel CEO Norbert Schulze said they did not know how many people died, but there were no injuries. “We cannot confirm the number now, because we have not been to the site. “But no one was injured,” said Schulze. He said the explosion at the propellant operations building destroyed the entire building and surrounding blast walls. “The area was cordoned off as it is still unsafe,” he said. Monwabisi Bukwele Western Cape Liberated Metalworkers’ Union of South Africa secretary was upset as they were not allowed access to the plant. “We have members who work here and we don’t know if they are dead,” he said. State Security Minister Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba visited the plant and met families yesterday morning. She said: “The families who lost their loved ones are our first priority. “We are here to get information about what really happened and wait for the outcome of the investigation. It will take time.” Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan expressed his deepest sadness and sincere condolences to the families. Gordhan assured them necessary trauma counselling and social support would be provided during their difficult time. He also said the cause of the accident would be thoroughly investigated. Police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said: “The police are investigating. “The purpose of the inquest is to determine the circumstances and cause of death.”
