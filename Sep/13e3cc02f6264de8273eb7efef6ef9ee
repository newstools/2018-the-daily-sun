POLOKWANE police have shut down a local taxi rank indefinitely after cops were attacked by suspects travelling in two vehicles. Two cops were injured and one suspect was wounded in the leg on Friday afternoon. Cops had just arrested suspects on suspicion of drug possession. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the cops were attacked by the suspects, who pelted them with stones and other objects. “Two members suffered slight injuries and two police vehicles were damaged,” he told the People’s Paper. The situation got worse after the group allegedly started shooting at the police, who retaliated. “Three suspects, including the one who was shot, were arrested and taken to the police station,” he said. “While at the police station, one of the arrested suspects was so intoxicated, possibly on drugs or nyaope, he started damaging police equipment including computers, photocopiers, walls and windows.” Ngoepe said the rank was shut down on Saturday and would remain closed until cops were satisfied that the taximen were obeying the law. Taxis to Polokwane Extensions, Bochum and Mmotong are operating at Rissik Street near the rank. The suspects will appear in the Polokwane Magistrates Court soon on charges of attempted murder, malicious damage to property and possession of dagga. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba condemned the attack.
