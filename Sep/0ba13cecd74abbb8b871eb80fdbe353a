TIGER Brand’s Nishaan Purshad said no citizen is allowed to remove expired foods illegally. The head of internal audit was giving testimony yesterday at the South African Human Rights Commission hearings on the sale of expired and counterfeit goods in Braamfontein, Joburg. “Nobody can go and lift a product that they see is expired. That is against the law. “Officials need to follow due process,” said Purshad. “The only way to do it lawfully is to purchase the product, send it for testing and then approach the department of health with results. “You may identify a product as counterfeit due to your knowledge of original product. But in order to prove that product is counterfeit, you still need to purchase it. “Once the proof is available, in terms of the Counterfeit Act you can then go to the police.” Purshad said the police can only investigate allegations of counterfeit goods if the goods in question reach a quantity of 500 000. He added that his company identified Tembisa township, Ekurhuleni, as a fake goods hot spot. “When the product does get confiscated, there is prosecution. In many instances, perpetrators are just given a R5 000 fine and nothing else happens.” Joburg Metro police chief Mike Smith also testified. He dismissed allegations made in the previous sitting by the Somali Community Board that the cops knew about the planned looting of foreign shops three months before the violent unrest.
