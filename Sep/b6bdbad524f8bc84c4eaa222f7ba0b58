NASIPHI Majokweni was supposed to bury her brother in Limpopo on Saturday after he was burnt in a shack fire three weeks ago. But 21-year-old woman from White City in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, suffered a big blow after her shack went up in flames as well. The shack, together with two others, burnt down on Saturday morning, leaving Nasiphi with nothing. She told Daily Sun: “The fire started in the shack next to mine. We are lucky we escaped with no injuries because the fire started while we were asleep.” Nasiphi and her family lost furniture, clothes and food, as well as ID books, banks cards and R850 in cash. On 10 September, Daily Sun published the story of Nasiphi’s brother Ruben Mnisi (27), who was badly burnt in his shack in B1, Mamelodi West. He later died at Steve Biko Academic Hospital. Nasiphi could not attend her brother’s funeral. She is pleading with SunReaders to help them find a place to stay, clothes and food. Captain Johannes Maheso confirmed that a shack burned down. “An inquiry has been registered to find out what caused the fire,” he said. Tshwane emergency services spokesman Johan Pieterse said there were no injuries and the cause of the fire was unknown.
