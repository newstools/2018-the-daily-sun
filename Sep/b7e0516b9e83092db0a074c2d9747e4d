AFTER Zakhele Sikhosana was shot dead, his spirit immediately got revenge. Furious residents chased the gunman, beat him to a pulp and necklaced him. As the 31-year-old victim’s body was lying in a pool of blood, his killer screamed for mercy as the flames burned him. According to witnesses, Zakhele had asked the gunman for money that he was owed but ended up getting a bullet in the stomach. The incident happened on Thursday afternoon in full view of residents of Vezubuhle Crossroads, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga. Zakhele’s mum Lettie (65) said her son’s murder had left her devastated. “I was sitting at home watching TV when I received a call saying my son had been shot. “I thought he had been wounded but when I arrived, I found him lying in a pool of blood.” Angry residents told the SunTeam the killer had been terrorising the community since being released from prison last month. Witness Thambi Mbatha (33) said he saw Zakhele and the gunman arguing before the murder. “The gunman seemed to be walking away when he turned around and pulled out a gun,” he said. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed the incident and said two cases of murder were opened.
