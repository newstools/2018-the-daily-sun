CALM has returned to Soweto after a week filled with violence, looting and hooliganism. The looting started in White City and quickly spread to other areas. It’s still not clear what sparked the violence, but according to reports it was caused by claims that foreign shop owners were selling fake and expired goods. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the situation was calm in Soweto and surrounding areas yesterday. He confirmed that four people were killed in last week’s violence. Three of the victims were from Soweto and a fourth from Kagiso in Mogale City. Dlamini said cops had been sent to all areas of Gauteng to deal with the situation and prevent any further attacks and looting. He said several operations were conducted in Soweto and five fridges, one deep freezer, one juice machine and a deep fryer were seized. “Police arrested 27 suspects on charges of murder, attempted murder, possession of an unlicensed firearm and public violence.” They appeared in the Protea Magistrates Court on Friday.
