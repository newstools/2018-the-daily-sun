THE SOUTH African Police Services held its annual Commemoration Day at the Police Memorial Site at the Union Buildings. At the commemoration, Police Minister Bheki Cele condemned the killing of cops, while honouring the 29 fallen cops who died in the line of duty between April 2017 to 31 March 2018. "We call on all communities and society to work with the police to fight the scourge of police killings. Police members are a national asset and they need to be protected by all of us. One police killing is one to many.  My wish is for events of this nature to never happen. We should never have to lose our own members through the hands of criminals.  The safety of our men and women in blue remains high on the agenda of the SAPS and is at the heart of the SAPS's strategic imperatives to ensure the safety of our members," Cele said. On behalf of the National Commissioner of Police, General Khehla Sitole, who was out of the country on duty, the Acting National Commissioner, Lieutenant General Lebeoana Jacob Tsumane, added that the Service will continue to put in place measures to ensure that members are always operationally ready to respond to the call of duty. "Our resolve to equip members with the necessary skills to ensure their safety will contribute to our fight against crime. Throughout September, which has been declared National Police Safety Month, we will continue to increase safety awareness among our members in order to highlight measures to reduce attacks, vehicle accidents and the murder of our police officials,” said Lt Gen Tsumane We will also continue to ensure that we invest in the future of these children by supporting them through the Service's Education Trust Fund".
