KE YONA Team coaches Khabo Zondo and Ephraim “Shakes” Mashaba will have to wait yet another year to try their luck and register their first victory in the Nedbank Ke Yona Challenge. The Ke Yona team, selected from all corners of Mzansi, suffered a 2-1 defeat to Nedbank Cup champions Free State Stars at the fully packed Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa yesterday. But the young aspiring stars did not go down without a fight and showed little respect for Luc Eymael’s charges on the day. Ea Lla Koto were the first to find the back of the net less than five minutes into the game when Yusuf Jappie connected with a well-taken corner by Sinethemba Jantjie to put Stars in the lead. But their celebrations were short-lived as Team Ke Yona managed to grab the equaliser in the seventh minute thanks to Lunathi Mdatyulwa, who produced a Man of the Match performance on the day. Eleazar Rodgers, who was introduced in the second half, scored the winning goal for Ea Lla Koto in the 76th minute to ensure PSL sides remain undefeated in this competition. Despite not winning the match Team Ke Yona had a better performance than in the previous five seasons. There was a huge improvement from past years, which is something the coaches and sponsors always strive for in this initiative. Building on last year’s feat, when Team Ke Yona scored the team’s first goal as they went down 2-1 to SuperSport United, there were lot of positives to take from this encounter. And the players were certainly determined to finally break the duck and win Team Ke Yona’s first ever match, but Stars’ experience proved too much for them. The 16 players who played against Stars will be drafted to the 16 PSL clubs for a one-month trial on on Wednesday, all hoping to score professional contracts.
