PUPILS hoping to study further next year received valuable information at a career expo. It took place at Lwandle Migrant Museum on Saturday. Representatives from colleges and universities in the province were present. The provincial government presented student hopefuls with bursary opportunities, provided they are accepted to study next year. Zubenathi Voyi (19), who’s on a gap year, jumped at the opportunity to apply for a bursary. She said she was on a college waiting list at a university. Cingelwa Kelemfana (18), who also hopes to study next year, said: “I’m looking for a place to study but I never considered college because most of us look down on them. “After today I understand the difference and see they also have a role to play in shaping futures.” Arthur Ketile of False Bay College told the youth the sooner they applied, the better. “A mother once died while standing in a queue for her child. To avoid stampeding, people need to apply early.” Ketile said the youths were lucky to have bursaries. The young people were also provided with career choice assessments to help them decide what they could study. College of Cape Town student recruitment officer Abulele Maxakana told the People’s Paper: “Colleges also offer pre-matric courses for those pupils who couldn’t finish matric.”
