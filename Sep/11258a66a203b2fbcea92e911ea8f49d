THE angry crowd threw rocks at the Belfast Magistrates Court buildings on Friday. This was after they heard that the two accused of assaulting Godfrey Masuku in Machado, Mpumalanga were granted R500 bail each. Godfrey was allegedly beaten by the two accused – Wayne Swart (20) and Bruce Botha (29). He couldn’t attend the court hearing as he was still in hospital. When the crowd tried to force its way into the court, the police retaliated and fired rubber bullets. Residents told the People’s Paper they’ve had enough of being abused by mlungus. “The court has shown us the middle finger. We realise that the law regards black people as animals,” said a resident. Mpumalanga EFF leader Collen Sedibe told Daily Sun the situation was no different to the coffin case. “It is clear that black lives don’t matter,” he said. The ANC’s Nkangala regional secretary Leah Mabuza said she was disappointed that the men were released on bail. Magistrate Nomampondo Hermans said the two had no pending cases or convictions and had to be granted bail. Swart and Botha will appear in court again on 28 September. Six people were arrested in connection with the public violence taking place in the area. They will appear in court soon.
