KASI kids will learn about their heritage in style. Exclusive Kids has organised a party for kids and their parents to experience the inaugural Soweto Kids Heritage Festival. The event will be held at GOG Gardens, Soweto in Protea Glen on Monday. Sebenzile Khumalo (34), founder of the festival, said the event would feature fashion shows with kids’ cultural clothes, dance and stories. “The event aims to expose kids to South African heritage and culture, which is vital to their developmental needs. “This will ensure that they grow up celebrating and embracing who they are as Africans,” Sebenzile told Daily Sun. She said the festival would also give kasi entrepreneurs a chance to show their products and services. “There will be more than 50 stalls selling kids’ products and services. “The event aims to attract more than 3 000 parents and kids between the ages of two and 12.” GOG owner Tim Hogins said the venue was safe and friendly for kids and parents. “I’m glad to have young ones come and interact and be happy at the same time,” he told the People’s Paper.
