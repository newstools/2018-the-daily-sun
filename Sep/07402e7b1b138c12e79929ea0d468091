 A video of what seems like an attempted cell phone robbery has surfaced on social media. But there are conflicting reports, as some social media users say it was an attempted kidnapping. In the video, a white Toyota Avanza can be seen driving pass a pupil, and it immediately stops and the passenger on the right hand side comes out before the Avanza starts to reverse. The pupil immediately starts running away as the passenger runs towards him. The man from the Avanza eventually catches up with the pedestrian and seems to be taking something from the pedestrian and runs back to the Avanza. The incident allegedly happened in Edenvale.
