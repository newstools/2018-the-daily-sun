LIFE
is about to get better for South African consumers in the communications and entertainment
sector. Globally,
customers have become accustomed to joined offerings through one provider for
all their connectivity and entertainment services. “South
Africans currently get multiple bills, deal with several service providers and
may have a number of monthly debit orders coming off their accounts. Now,
South Africans can join the international trend, by signing up for MediaPlay, a
revolutionary new, first-to-market solution from Cell C,” Chief Commercial Officer
Junaid Munshi. According
to Munshi, MediaPlay empowers consumers to plan and budget for their
connectivity and entertainment needs through one contract. “This
transformation contract gives customers all access connectivity and
entertainment in one plan. MediaPlay
allows customers to connect with the world and with friends and family plus
keep up with their favourite movies, series, sports, news and music,” added Munshi. Munshi
says MediaPlay simplifies customers’ lives by bringing them an all in one
communications and entertainment solution through great value plans, whether on
mobile, high speed fixed 4G or Fibre. “It’s
that easy. The hassle of multiple bills and debit orders are now a thing of the
past making life simpler, thus giving Cell C customers more time to connect,
browse and enjoy hours of endless entertainment,” Munshi said.
