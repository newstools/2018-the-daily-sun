STOP dumping your rubbish next to our homes! This is the plea of people who live on Maxabashawa and Maphikheni streets in Motherwell NU10, Port Elizabeth, to fellow residents. They accused the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality of making matters worse by not collecting rubbish on time. The heap of rubbish is next to Sindiswa Toni’s house. Sindiswa (58) told Daily Sun: “As far as I can remember this dump hasn’t been cleared this year. “A few weeks ago a municipal truck took one load but never returned. It left behind a heap of rubbish. “Residents come from other streets to dump rotting animals and other rubbish behind our houses.” A resident said a municipal worker in a frontloader recently asked her for R30 to clear her rubbish Another resident, Nolumo Bili (40), said she felt angry to see municipal trucks driving past the area without clearing the rubbish. “We often see empty municipal trucks driving past our houses. Why aren’t the drivers clearing this rubbish? Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki told the People’s Paper: “The illegal dumping and cleaning schedule of the Addo Road depot has scheduled next Tuesday to clear the illegal dump in ward 55, including the areas mentioned above.”
