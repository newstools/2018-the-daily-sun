A HOMELESS man known as Tefo was found dead under a tree in the Bloemfontein CBD on Monday. His friends claim two days before he died, he told them he was going to meet his ancestors soon but they thought he was joking. At this stage, it’s not known what killed him. Thabo Merwe said: “Tefo had being telling us that whenever he closed his eyes, he saw himself among the dead at a cemetery. I thought he was high on glue. Two days ago, he dreamed of being buried. What is strange is that he wasn’t sick.” Thabo said when he tried to wake Tefo up on Saturday, he told him he didn’t feel like waking up. “When I returned from scavenging for food on Monday afternoon, I tried to wake him up, but he wasn’t moving. So I asked nearby taxi drivers for help. That’s when we found out he was dead,” he said. Thabo said he only knew his friend as Tefo and he never spoke about where he was from or his family. “He had been living on the streets for about seven years. I suspected that he was mentally ill as he didn’t make sense most of the time.” One of the taxi drivers said: “I was shocked to find the homeless man cold and motionless with flies all over him. His friend came rushing to us and told us his friend didn’t want to wake up. “After we checked him, we could see that he was dead.” Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covana said: “The body was send to the government mortuary for a post mortem. “We’ve opened an inquest docket in the meantime.”
