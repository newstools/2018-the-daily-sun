CHARACTER Langa claims his song Injumlungu is not getting air play on the SABC as radio stations believe it promotes racism. But the kwaito star said this was because of a misunderstanding of kasi slang. When translated to English, the title means a white person is a dog, but ekasi people call their bosses at work mlungu, regardless of their race. Character said the song was about people who partied hard over the weekend but didn’t want to go back to work on Monday. “Most radio stations think the title of my song promotes racism, but this is not true. “This song talks about the people who party over the weekend and decide not to go to work on Monday morning because they have a bhabhalazi,” he said. “In most cases you will hear people saying injumlungu, which means they can’t work while they’re tired due to a hangover.” Character said he was trying to get the radio stations to play his song. He said the festive season was just around the corner and people wanted good music to dance to. When the SunTeam asked him to name the radio stations that didn’t want to play the song, he said: “Please, allow me not to name them because we are still in talks.” He said he was planning to release an album next month titled Umlingo. Neo Momodu, a spokeswoman for the public broadcaster, said she was not aware of Character’s complaint. “I will have to check the facts before I’m able to provide a comment.”
