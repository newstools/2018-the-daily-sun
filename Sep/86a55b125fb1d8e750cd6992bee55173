GOGO Mirriam Shoba is 100 years old and going strong. The SunTeam recently visited the gogo at her home in KwaMashu K section. She lives with her daughter, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Although gogo Mirriam can’t walk and has memory problems, her eyesight and hearing are still very sharp. Speaking from her bed during the visit, she even offered the SunTeam food. “A person can’t come and leave the house without eating anything. “They must prepare something for you,” she said. Her daughter Boniwe (63) said she believed her mum had reached such a ripe age because she often ate fresh vegetables from her garden. “She gave birth to eight children but unfortunately, I’m her only surviving child. She has 12 grandkids and six great-grandchildren. “I feel she’s really blessed to have lived this long.” Boniwe said when she and her siblings were growing up, her mum used to tell them they needed to respect their elders and eat healthily to live long. “I think her healthy eating made her very strong as she doesn’t even have high blood pressure or diabetes,” she said. Boniwe said her mum didn’t take any medication and had never been admitted to hospital. “The only problem is that she stopped walking in December, so we move her around the house. If she wants to sit outside in the sun, we take her there.” Gogo Mirriam said she enjoyed the company of her great-grandchildren and spent the whole day talking to them.
