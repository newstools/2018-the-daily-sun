THE journey continues for Banyana Banyana. After a fine start to the 2018 Cosafa Women’s Championships currently underway in Port Elizabeth, Banyana only need two more victories to successfully defend the title they won in Zimbabwe last year. Desiree Ellis’ women kicked off their 2018 push with three convincing group match victories. Banyana youngsters Linda Motlhalo (20) and Khanya Xesi (19), who have featured in all the national teams from Under-17 level to the senior team, believe teamwork is what makes them tick. In their last group match where they thrashed Malawi 6-0 the duo both got on the scoresheet, with Motlhalo hitting a hat-trick and Xesi a brace. The duo is expected to lead Banyana’s front line again when they lock horns with Uganda in the semifinals at Wolfson Stadium today (3pm). The two are among the leading goal-scorers at the tournament with three goals apiece – tied with Mpeh Bissong of Cameroon. Xesi believes Banyana will win the Cosafa Cup again: “We will focus on us, rather than thinking about Uganda. There’s nothing special about them. We just need to stick to our game plan. We have good, capable players who can lead us to victory. “I’m happy to have scored goals for the team but it’s not all about me – we are working as a team. I cannot take the credit alone.” Star midfielder Motlhalo echoed Xesi’s sentiments: “It has always been about team effort. I scored three goals because we were working as a team. “It won’t be easy but I believe we need to score as many goals as possible to reach the final.”
