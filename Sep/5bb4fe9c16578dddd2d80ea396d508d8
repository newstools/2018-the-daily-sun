THE Port Elizabeth High Court has sentenced a 29-year-old man to three life terms for raping two Nelson Mandela University students and sexually assaulting another woman. On Wednesday, Judge Dayalin Chetty handed down three life sentences and an additional 47 years to Kwanele Kilana. Kilana was convicted on two counts of rape, attempted robbery, housebreaking, two counts of robbery, three counts of sexual assault and four counts of rape. He was also sentenced to three years for housebreaking, 30 years for two counts of robbery, one year for attempted robbery, 13 years for three counts of sexual assault and three life terms for four counts of rape. Last July, Kilana attacked a 27-year-old woman near Greenacres Village. He raped her and robbed her of her cellphone and money. In October, he raped a 25-year-old and another 29-year-old student in a computer lab at the Second Avenue campus. He robbed them of their cellphones and stabbed one with a pair of scissors before making off with computer equipment. He was bust in the Port Elizabeth CBD after shoppers called cops when he tried to sell the stolen computer and cellphone belonging to one of the students. He has been in jail since his arrest after refusing to apply for bail. Chetty said: “The nature of these offences, the method of their execution, the impact which wronged the victims and the accused’s taste for violence towards the women called for a sentence compatible with the nature of the crimes. “This case shows he is a danger to women and their safety can only be guaranteed by his permanent removal from society.”
