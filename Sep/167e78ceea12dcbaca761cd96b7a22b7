THE Master Key, a play that highlights the brutality of apartheid, is running at the Port Elizabeth Opera House. The play can be seen at the theatre until tomorrow. The cast is made up of Anele Penny, Nobesuthu Rayi, Olwethu Mdala and Xabiso Zweni. The lead character’s name is Saint, a man who experienced a lot of suffering. Cingiwe Skosana, the theatre’s marketing officer, said: “Apartheid is not only a story of big names and well-known prisoners. “It was a web that entangled every black person in South Africa. “Saint’s journey from Fort Hare University to Kirkwood Police Station cells is a drastic change of fortune. “He doesn’t cry because the lives of the people around him are just as ruined as his. “Everyone in the play needs a master key to unlock their lives.” The play was written by Monde Ngonyama and directed by Xabisa Zweni, who has a wealth of experience in the industry. He has directed popular plays such as Sophia Is Gone, From Kostern with Love and The Ghost of Glenmore. “Xabiso worked with world-famous theatre and television veteran Nomhle Nkonyeni in The Truck Driver. “He performs and directs industrial theatre pieces for companies like Transnet, General Motors, Volkswagen and Nedbank. “He is also a recipient of the Eastern Cape Arts and Culture Award for Best Performer in Drama,” said Skosana.
