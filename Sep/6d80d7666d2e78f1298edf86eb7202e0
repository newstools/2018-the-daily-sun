WHEN residents of F section in Khayelitsha hear the words Head Office, they don’t think about chairs, desks or computers. All they think about is food! The Kanayo sisters run a food stall which sells smileys or sheep heads and amagwinya. The busy spot got its name from using a play on the word ‘head’. “We mainly deal with sheep heads and that’s why we ended up calling this place Head Office. It’s a popular spot where we sell to municipal workers, Khayelitsha court staff and the community,” said Priscilla Kanayo (42). She runs the business with her sister Mariana Kanayo (40). “I have three children and I take care of them through this business. I also look after my mother. I always take my business seriously because it helps me look after the people I love most.” “Business has its days. Sometimes things go well but other times it can be quiet,” she said. They sometimes sell less than five sheep heads a day but it was a good day when Daily Sun visited Head Office on Saturday. “Today was one of the better days. We sold about 30 sheep heads. It was a good weekend,” said Priscilla. Nomonde Khalipha (30) regularly supports Priscilla’s business. “My kids and I usually buy the sheep head to eat with pap. I like buying at Head Office because the meat is tender and well cooked.” Priscilla said the secret to keeping customers coming back is to do things wholeheartedly. “There is competition out there but you have to make sure the customers are always happy.”
