THE murder rate in Gauteng went up by 3,2%, but attempted murder has declinedby 8,4%. This was revealed by Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane during a performance review meeting in Muldersdrift, Mogale City, on Wednesday. She was joined by police officials and Tshwane, Joburg, Ekurhuleni and Gauteng traffic cops. She identified eight underperforming cop shops in the province: Akasia, Ivory Park, Tembisa, Kempton Park, Kagiso, Krugersdorp, Dobsonville and Honeydew. “While crime levels are still unacceptably very high in the province, I’m delighted that Gauteng has recorded some improvement in the number of underperforming police stations, from 13 to eight.” The MEC said 88 cash-in-transit robberies were recorded in the past year, a sharp increase from 33 cases reported in 2016 and last year.
