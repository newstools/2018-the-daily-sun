 Taking to social media, the musician slammed the South
African Police Service for being unable to deal with thugs. Ringo’s Instagram rant came after a video surfaced in which
a robbery was taking place in full view of the public. Posting the video, he voiced his frustration at the lack of
action. “Where are you when we, as citizens, can see this bunch of
kids attacking people like a bunch of dogs?” he said. Ringo then went on to share an incident that happened to him
four years ago. According to Ringo, his car was hit with a jamming device at
on the N1 near Grasmere. He said that despite conducting an investigation and
submitting evidence to the cops, no action has been taken. He then further slams the SAPS for being selective in which
crime to solve. “I remember during the 2010 World Cup, One robbery was
solved within 7 days and the robbers were even sentenced within that time,” he
said. “Why is it difficult when it comes to dealing with national
issues? “Compared to international issues, I would presume, [it was]
because the 2010 Soccer World Cup was an international project. “We cannot be held at ransom by small kids with dangerous
weapons while students, fighting for noble causes are easily killed on our
learning institutions,” he said.
