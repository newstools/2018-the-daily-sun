IS that crazy fizz you feel because you’re desperate to
poke the person? Or is it the start of falling in deep, everlasting love? Researchers have been working out the answers to these
questions, as Huffington Post reports. One team studied the brain chemistry that happens when a
person feels desire for someone else. On the basis of this they divided
romantic love into three categories: 1. Lust This is the intense desire to get naked with the person.
Hormones like testosterone and estrogen are released, increasing the person’s
libido (sex drive). Often, lust decreases over time. 2. Attraction This is a desire for sex plus a whole lot of other interest.
You might find you can’t stop thinking about the person and every minute you’re
not together is an agony. In this case, your body releases other chemicals like
dopamine that give you feelings like intense joy, taking away any interest in
eating or sleeping. 3. Attachment or “compassionate
love” Here the feelings may still have a strong tinge of lust in
the mix, but the difference is that the connection is emotional as well.
Hormones like oxytocin and vasopressin are released, and you feel bonded in a
deeper and lasting way. The ultimate test of whether a desire for someone is an
intense need to have sex with them or longer lasting love is this: lust is
about you and your sex needs. Love is about them – to the point that, if you
believe they would be living their best life without you, you’d let your loved
one go.
