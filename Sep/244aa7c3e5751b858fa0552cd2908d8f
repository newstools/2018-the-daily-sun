Psychologist Andrey Zhelvetro buries his patients alive during
therapy so that they "feel alive". He places his patients in coffins before burying them as part
of psychological treatment. According to the Mirror, his unusual methods became known
after a villager found 12 empty coffins abandoned in the forest near the
capital city of Kiev in northern Ukraine. The villager reportedly found a dozen freshly dug graves at
the scene and called the police. Police began looking into the incident and their
investigations led them to Zhelvetro, who reportedly admitted that the coffins
were used by him in his psychological treatment. According to the medical professional, he took 12 of his
patients into the forest and buried them alive for two hours. A video filmed by Zhelvetro and posted online with the
purpose of advertising shows one of his patients undergoing the therapy. The clip shows a coffin put into a freshly buried grave. A
young man dressed in a white shirt is then seen lying down in the coffin before
being buried. A pipe can be seen sticking out of the coffin so the patient
can breath during the two hours of the therapy. One of the patients who was reportedly buried alive said:
"When I got out of the coffin, I felt as if I had become a new person.
That was strange."
