THE teacher who was stabbed by a pupil was remembered as a leader. The memorial service for Gadimang Mokolobate (24) was held in Lehurutshe, Zeerust, North West, yesterday. Gadimang was allegedly stabbed by a 17-year-old pupil last Thursday over food. Among the dignitaries who attended the service was Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. She said she could relate as she had also lost a 24-year-old child. “To say the alleged killer did it because of poverty is wrong. Everyone is hungry. It’s pure thuggery. There is no place for anarchy in schools,” she said. Motshekga said she wished the justice system was delayed until the suspect turned 18 so he could be dealt with appropriately. Family member Thabang Rammutla described him as a born leader. “Our hearts are torn apart. We have lost a child through the hands of a child he was teaching. Gadimang left a void and footprint no one can fill or emulate,” he said. Deputy principal Lekhau Modungwa said Gadimang was invigilating a graphic design exam paper with a colleague. “Just a few seconds after I left the exam room, this boy went past and no one took any notice of him. Then Mokolobate came out holding his chest, with kids screaming ‘he stabbed him, he stabbed him’.” Modungwa said they found the boy walking down the street, showing no emotion. “The boy said the teacher always harassed him.” Sadtu deputy president Mabutho Cele said it was not the teacher’s job to help serve food in the first place.
