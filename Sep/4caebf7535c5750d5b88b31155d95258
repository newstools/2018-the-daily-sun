DOVES are symbols of peace but for Isaac Mabasa (49) from Duduza, Ekurhuleni, they are creatures of terror. Isaac believes doves are being used to bewitch him and his family. When the doves made a nest on his roof in 2010, he thought nothing of it. But in 2016 he bumped into a sangoma who told him his life wouldn’t be peaceful as long as the doves lived on his roof. “I was shocked. I knew we had abnormal problems but I never thought the doves were responsible,” said Isaac. He told Daily Sun the doves were most active when he started cooking. “I tried to get rid of them by sprinkling muthi in my house, but I’m not winning,” he said. Isaac said his wife of 15 years slept in a different room because of the doves. “Everything has changed. My wife and I always fight.” He said a community member told him the doves were the reason his kids were confused about their future. Isaac said he heard strange noises coming from his roof at night, and he believed a tokoloshe was responsible. “I just want to fix my life. Please help me.”
