A GRIEVING family has spoken out about their total horror after finding the murdered family member’s head stuffed into her handbag. According to Daily Nation, the unnamed 55-year-old woman went missing on 17 September from her home in Antoandrew village, central Kenya. Her son, James Kirima, relived the horror of discovering his mum’s headless dead body 10 days later. “My son came running and told me that together with other villagers, he had seen a body of a woman without a head. “My son identified the body as his gogo’s because of the clothes the deceased had worn.” They reported the murder to the cops, and it was a full seven days later that her head was found, stuffed inside her handbag and dumped in a nearby stream. The burial had to be delayed until the head was reunited with her body, but the woman was finally laid to rest today. Cops have since arrested James’ uncle, Peter Murungi Muthinja, and charged him with her murder on Thursday. The murder seems to be linked to the family’s bitter fight over land.
