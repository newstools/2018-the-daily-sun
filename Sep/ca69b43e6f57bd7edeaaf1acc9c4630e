LOCALS living near a graveyard in Russia were shocked and
astonished when a giant iPhone was suddenly installed as a dead young woman’s
gravestone. According to The Sun, Rita Shameeva died of an unknown
cause in January 2016 when she was only 25 – and absolutely lived for her
iPhone. Two years later, her heartbroken dad had the 1,5 meter
tall gravestone made of black basalt carved to look like an iPhone installed at
her gravestone. It has an image of the stunning young Rita on it. One local, Nikolay Yevdokimov told newspaper ProUral: “I
thought I was having hallucinations. “How could an
American smartphone suddenly appear at our cemetery? “And such a huge one. “I came closer and was surprised. “I've seen many gravestones, but to make one in the form
of an iPhone - this is the first time, to be honest."
