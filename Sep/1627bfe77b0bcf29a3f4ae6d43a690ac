BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic players have vowed to boycott today’s Absa Premiership clash against Maritzburg United if their salaries are not paid in full. The players have boycotted training this week. They did not train on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Yesterday, they were supposed to have had a light session and that also did not happen due to the players’ stay-away. “We returned from our match against Black Leopards in Venda on Monday and gave the players on off-day on Tuesday. They have not returned – the reason being their signing-on fees not being paid,” said Celtic media officer Sello Nduna yesterday. Nduna emphasized that the payment of the players may have happened late yesterday after speaking to SunSport. Nduna would not comment on whether the game would not take place or not. “From the office, all the proparations are going ahead. We are continuing selling tickets and ready to welcome Maritzburg,” he added. This is a huge blow for Steve Komphela’s charges, who have been doing well so far since the start of the season. outfit that had put their off-the-pitch troubles aside since the start of season to win four out of five Absa Premiership matches they have played so far, having drawn one game. The disgruntled players and fans arranged a meeting with Leshabane on Thursday afternoon, hoping she would remedy the situation. Former Celtic boss, Jimmy Augusti, said he would try to rescue the situation. Augusti told SunSport he tried to buy back the team from Tshabalala without success, as the price tag is too high. Augusti sold the club for around R50 million to Tshabalala in 2014. He said: “I had a meeting with Max and I found out they want R85 million, which is not worth it, as the club is in debt. “It’s a shame that the pride of Bloemfontein is in such a dire situation. Steve and players have been doing a great job under such conditions. “I’m currently on holiday and will find out the details when I return.”
