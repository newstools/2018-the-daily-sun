THIS woman wants justice after she was allegedly assaulted for being fat. Sive Lumka (26) wanted to take a taxi home from Somerset West to Nomzamo kasi near Strand. She was with a friend when the incident happened last Saturday. “The taxi driver said we couldn’t get into his taxi because I’m too fat,” she said. “He said I’d damage his taxi. I asked him if it was his taxi or if he was just the driver and we exchanged words. “I couldn’t keep quiet while he was insulting me. He then became angry and started beating me.” Sive said some drivers watched while others tried to stop the driver. She said she bled after the beating and her expensive false teeth were broken. “I went home and my mum took me to the police station to open a case,” she said. The two also went to the taxi rank to report the matter. Sive said the driver was called and admitted to beating her. “He said he got angry and couldn’t contain himself,” said Sive. “The taxi association asked what of my false teeth cost and the money I used to travel to the doctor. They said they will be in touch.” Taxi rank secretary Jerry Bobi said they were investigating. “The driver will be subjected to a disciplinary hearing and we will contact the woman,” said Jerry. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said police were investigating a case of assault.
