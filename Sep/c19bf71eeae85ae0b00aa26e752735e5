POLICE worked hard to arrest four suspects in connection with the murder of Yvonne Martins’ son. But in a shocking twist, she said she wants the cops to release them. This is because Yvonne believes the police arrested the wrong people and the killers are still walking free! The 58-year-old from Eldorado Park, Joburg, said she was a prophet. Her amadlozi told her the people who murdered her son, Raymond Roger (33), who was buried last week, were still at large. Yvonne told Daily Sun her son went missing on the fourth of last month and she opened a case with the police two days later. Just a few days after that, she went to identify his body in the mortuary. He had been murdered and dumped in a ditch in Lenasia. “The person assisting me at the mortuary told me there were no unidentified bodies but as I turned to leave, the spirit told me my son was there. After double checking, I identified him,” she said. Yvonne claimed her prophetic gifts told her the people in custody were innocent. But the police say they have two witnesses. “The spirit within me says I should look closer to me. My son’s death was not just an unfortunate coincidence. I know better than to ignore the warnings. The holy spirit is trying to reveal something to me.” Yvonne said the spirit had also advised her against going to court for the suspects’ appearance. She said arranging her son’s funeral had already taken a toll on her. “As a mother, I have to look closely to try and solve the mystery around my son’s murder. These suspects are not responsible,” she said. “It pains me to know the killers are scot free enjoying life while I cry over the loss of my humble son.” Police spokesman Captain Hector Netshivhodza said a murder case was opened and the cops were guided by the law. “Four suspects, aged between 26 and 44, were arrested. The next court date is next month,” he said.
