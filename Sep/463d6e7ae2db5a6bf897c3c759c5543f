SHACK dwellers in H Section, Ntuzuma, northern KZN, are fuming. They said they wanted eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede to visit them. This comes after 50 of their shacks were demolished on Monday. They were allegedly destroyed by security guards fromthe municipal land invasion unit. They told Daily Sun they have been left stranded. Zabonke Ngubane (31) said: “They didn’t tell us they would come and demolish our shacks. They just came here, beat us up and took all our belongings.” Zabantu said the municipality and ward councillor knew they had occupied the land near the old Ntuzuma Magistrates Court. “It had been vacant for about 30 years. We really don’t know why they are abusing us now,” he said. Another resident, Cebolenkosi Mthethwa (30), said: “The guards beat me up and threatened to shoot me.” Phumelele Mtolo (31) said: “Building material I had just bought worth R4 000 was taken. I need to know why.” They said they occupied the land early last year. Councillor Njabulo Mabanga said he wasn’t aware of the demolition. “Some of those people moved there before I became a councillor,” he said. He said he had not allowed any residents to occupy the land but promised to organise a meeting with the municipality to find a solution. The mayor’s spokesman, Mthunzi Gumede’s cellphone, went to voicemail. Municipal spokesman Mandla Nsele said Gumede and the mayor couldn’t comment as they were at a meeting outside the country.
