THE e-tolls collection contract has just over two months
left and OUTA has accused lawyers of increasing the number of summonses issued. OUTA says this allegedly which ups their fees but not the
collections for Sanral. Answers to questions put to the Minister of Transport in
Parliament on e-tolls reveal that only 3 724 (24%) of the 15 505 summonses
issued from April 2015 to August 2018 have actually been served on the
defendants. “The summonses served, 1 320 are being defended. OUTA’s
lawyers are defending 1 028 of those cases through OUTA’s e-tolls defence
umbrella (78% of all cases being defended).” The Minister’s reply indicates that R10.231 million was
collected through this legal process from January 2016 to August 2018, while
ETC spent R4.6 million on legal fees to collect this. “Now compare this to the total outstanding e-toll debt of
about R11 billion,” OUTA said. According to OUTA, the statistics provided by the Minister
show last-minute attempts to increase the number of summonses. In the last two
months – July and August 2018 – a total of 4 055 summonses were drafted, which
was 67% of the summonses since January 2018 and 26% of all summonses since
April 2015. However, most of these summonses are not actually served on
the defendants. In July and August, only 345 summonses were actually served
on defaulters. “If one unpacks these figures, one can only assume the real
beneficiaries of the exorbitant effort of summonsing 15 505 e-toll defaulters
are the collection agency’s lawyers, Durban-based Morris Fuller Williams
Attorneys,” OUTA’s Transport Portfolio Manager Rudie Heyneke said.
