Reneilwe “Yeye” Letsholonyane and his wife Mpho are one of Mzansi’s favourite couples and their relationship is the envy of many. The pair have had their fair share of problems but they have come up trumps. While they are guarded when it comes to their private lives, they do share their special moments with fans on occasion. The two lovebirds are celebrating six months of marriage today and Mpho took to social media to leave a special message for her husband. She posted a lovely picture gallery that showed some of the couple’s best memories. “What bliss it has been spending the last 6 months of married life with you,” she captioned the picture gallery. “Happy Anniversary My Human. Here’s to Many More.” What bliss it has been spending the last 6 months of married life with you... Happy Anniversary My Human. Here’s to Many More ♥? ??
