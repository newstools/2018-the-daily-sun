MOERANE Commission witness Les Stuta finally has bodyguards, but not from the state. Stuta, who was late ANC Youth League national secretary Sindiso Magaqa’s friend, now moves around with six bodyguards. He was spotted by the SunTeam over the weekend in the company of armed men in dark glasses. Stuta confirmed to the People’s Paper on Tuesday that the men were indeed his protectors, but said they were not provided by the state. He said after seeing that the state was not prepared to protect him, he appealed to his friends for help. He refused to name those who helped him, saying he didn’t want to compromise their safety. “My friends realised my life was in danger, so they provided me with bodyguards. I’m feeling safe now, but I still need the state to provide me with bodyguards because my friends have now compromised their own security.” He said life has been hell for him after he spoke out and gave details about Magaqa’s death. He had received death threats and was warned not to sleep at his house. He told the Moerane Commission that Magaqa was killed because he was vocal about corruption allegedly taking place in the Umzimkhulu Municipality. After his allegations, the cops’ intelligence unit recommended the state should provide him with security as his life was in danger. Last month, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Stuta should have received state protection, but the state refused. Police Minister Bheki Cele said he was taking the report to court for a review. Cele’s spokeswoman, Reneilwe Serero, said the minister wouldn’t discuss the matter in public as it was sub judice.
