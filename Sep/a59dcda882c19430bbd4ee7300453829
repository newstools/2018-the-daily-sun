Vehicle crime is a grim reality on South Africa's roads where one vehicle isÂ hijacked every 32 minutes, according to 2017 SAPS Crime Stats. Criminals have become far more brazen than in the past and the lives of innocent people are disregarded for a few thousand rand, reports vehicle tracking specialists Pro-Active South Africa. What drives people to hijack cars in SA? Why is this vehicle crime so difficult to put an end to locally?  Pro-Active SA managing director Ryno Schutte interviewed two former hijackers, both of whom have served time in jail. Schutte told Wheels24 that the discussion with the two ex-convicts sheds valuable light on hijackings in South Africa: "One needs to take into consideration that the information mentioned cannot be generalised, but there are huge similarities on the way criminal organisations operate. "To get a better understanding on the backgrounds of the two ex-convicts it became clear during our discussion that there is not just one path that a 'hijacker' follows. "Both ex-cons came from two different walks of life but they both confirmed some sketchy yet valuable insight into hijackings and organised crime. It was confirmed that the suspects received around R5000 - R7000 for a German manufactured vehicle."
