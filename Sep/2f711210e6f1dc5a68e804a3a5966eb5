The Corruption Watch has made submissions to the SARS Commission of Inquiry. The organisation said is concerned about the absence of good governance and proper administration at Sars, while its mandate is reporting corruption, fraud, money laundering amongst other critical things throughout the region. The organisation has made its submission to the retired Judge Robert Nugent on Monday. The organisation head of legal and investigations, Leanne Govindsamy, said:  “We remain very concerned that the lack of accountability and transparency in relation to this matter is severely undermining deterrence of corrupt activity at Sars and beyond. Of equal concern is the need to overhaul governance and administration at the entity in order to prevent and deter maladministration and corruption at Sars,” said Corruption Watch. In a statement, the organisation said its submission highlights the suspended Sars Commissioner Tom Moyane’s role in delaying the investigation into two senior Sars employees, Mashudu Jonas Makwakwa and Kelly-Ann Elskie as well as Moyane’s contradictory statements. The submissions is further said to foreground the role of Moyane in disclosing the confidential Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) report to Makwakwa and Elskie and not reporting the matter to the Hawks. This resulted into Corruption Watch lodging criminal charges against Moyane for breaching section 34 of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act. Corruption Watch has urged the commission to enquire into the status of these criminal charges lodged in 2016, and to consider if such conduct also amounts to a breach of fiduciary duty, which could result in Moyane charged under the Public Finance Management Act.
