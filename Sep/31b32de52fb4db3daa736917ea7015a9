Hey, new Mercedes-Benz A35 can you beat the Audi S3? That's what Mercedes-Benz aims to do with the new A35, which will be making its public debut at the upcoming Paris Motor Show. The A35 is the "entry-level" AMG, it's supposed to be the cheapest way to get your hands on an AMG performance car. When you hear words like entry-level AMG you might be thinking this is a normal A-Class with some AMG badges thrown around. But fear not, this car has a lot of AMG infused in its DNA. That's because of the A35 4MATIC... long name I know. The development of the A35 was integrated into the development of the new Mercedes-Benz A-Class. "It was developed at the same time as the future A 45 4MATIC, making it possible to inject the AMG DNA into every relevant detail," says Mercedes. It is powered by a new 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo engine that cranks out 225 kW and 400 Nm of torque at 3000 RPM. Power is sent to all four wheels via a AMG's SPEEDSHIFT 7G dual-clutch transmission. It will do 0-100-km/h in 4.7 seconds, 0.1 slower than both the BMW M140i and Audi S3. The new A35 is a softer version of the upcoming A45 so we expect it to be more comfortable than the current which has a really harsh ride. To make it easier to live with the car offers drive modes "Slippery", "Comfort", "Sport", "Sport +" and "Individual" They tweak things, such as the response of the engine and transmission. Inside, the car offers Merc's new MBUX infotainment system which offers the "Hey Mercedes" feature that lets owner's control everything from the aircon to the sunroof. Local availability and pricing have not been announced.
