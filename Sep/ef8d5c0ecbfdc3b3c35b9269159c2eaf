Akani Simbine ended South Africa's IAAF Diamond League campaign on Friday night, taking fifth place in the 100m Men at the second leg of the series’ final in Brussels, Belgium. Simbine completed the short sprint in 10.03 seconds, with American athlete Christian Coleman taking the win in a world leading time of 9.79, dragging four men under the 10-second barrier. While Simbine was the only SA athlete competing for a Diamond League trophy at the Meeting, Wenda Nel finished seventh in the 400m Hurdles Women race, which was held as part of the pre-programme, in 57.93. Two South Africans won Diamond League titles at the first leg of the finals in Zurich, Switzwerland on Thursday, with Caster Semenya (800m) and Luvo Manyonga (Long Jump) successfully defending their series’ crowns. “It’s been a long season for most athletes. Simbine can now join the rest of those who have been selected to the African Team for the Continental Championships in Ostrava, Czech Republic,” said Aleck Skhosana, the President of Athletics South Africa.
