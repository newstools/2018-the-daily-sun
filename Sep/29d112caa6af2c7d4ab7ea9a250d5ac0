FACEBOOK is not just for sharing pictures and information. It can also be a platform where people fall in love. This couple proved that social media love is possible, as they went from inbox to marriage! Their chemistry led them to the altar. Speaking to Daily Sun, the Joburg-based couple, Tumi Mohasoa and Boitumelo Boikanyo, said neither of them was expecting to fall in love. Boitumelo said he first saw Tumi on Facebook in 2008. He was instantly drawn to her, but knew he had to devise a way to get her attention. “I sent her a friend request because I thought she was beautiful,” he said. He immediately sent her a message and briefly introduced himself – but communication between the two was cut off until 2013, when Boitumelo reached out to her again. When he saw that she was mourning the loss of her cousin, he connected with her as he had just lost his twin brother. They helped each other through the grief – and soon enough they fell in love. Now, after five years of a strong relationship, the two are ready to get married in December. “She accepted me even when I had nothing. Everything I have accumulated was with her by my side,” he said. Boitumelo said building a relationship with her eight-year-old son brought them closer. “I remember one day after spending the day with her and her son, I told them that I loved them both.” Tumi said when Boitumelo said that, she was deeply moved. She started loving him unconditionally. “I was led by God to this man,” said Tumi. “I knew that God wouldn’t lead me where He will abandon me.” Tumi said trusting her sixth sense helped her determine whether Boitumelo was real or just a chancer. “My respect for him is phenomenal,” she said.
