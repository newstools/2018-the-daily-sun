A young man who wanted to relieve himself at a communal toilet in Shayandima, outside Thohoyandou got the shock of his life on Tuesday. At about 11am, the man saw a woman’s body floating in the Tshidumbi River. When police got to the scene, they fished the decomposing body out of the water. The woman was identified as Tshifhiwa Ramagoma (43), who was reported missing last week after failing to return home to Itsani. Family spokesman Lufuno Ramagoma said he and his relatives were shocked and confused. “We knew she had problems, but she didn’t share them with us. “We didn’t expect her to die in the terrible manner she did. “She was a very reserved person and we wish she had talked to us. “If she had done that, maybe we could have done something to help her,” he said. Lufuno said the family still had no idea what led to her death and hoped the police would give them answers. He said the family would set a date for the burial after a post mortem was performed. A source close to Tshifiwa said her husband was ill in hospital, and said the woman had previously attempted to take her life. Community leader Takkie Madia said residents were worried the river was being turned into a dump site for corpses. “This must be the fifth body found in this river, and residents are starting to get concerned,” he said. “We have no idea what happened to her, but we believe police investigations will solve this mystery.” Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the incident. Ngoepe said police opened an inquest docket following the discovery.
