THE people of Jungle squatter camp in Marcus Garvey want the City of Cape Town to build toilets for them. They said they were tired of relieving themselves in buckets. Gogo Nomawethu Bhongo (65) said they’ve been using buckets since they arrived in the area. “We arrived here in 2002 and have never had proper toilets. But when it’s election time, we vote in numbers, hoping the city will build toilets for us. “But nothing has happened. We demand proper toilets from the city,” she said. Nomawethu said squatters relieve themselves in the nearby bush. “But people are not safe because thugs often target them when they go to the bush,” she said. “It’s better to use a bucket than to be raped by heartless criminals.” Malizole Fihlani (48) said they were offered mobile toilets but they didn’t want them. “We don’t want the toilets because they will be used for crime and people might lose their lives. “We demand proper toilets like the ones which were built in Marikana squatter camp.” Xanthea Limberg, a member of mayoral committee for water and waste services, said: “Jungle sqautter camp is situated on an electrical servitude. “It is also partially on city land as a result of an illegal land invasion. The city provides basic services in the area, including 10 water taps. The squatters have been offered chemical toilets and container toilets, but rejected them. “The city will continue to talk to the squatters’ leaders.”
