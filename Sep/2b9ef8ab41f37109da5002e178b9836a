ALL the teachers at the troubled Masakhaneni High School in KwaMakhutha kasi, south of Durban, will be removed. Daily Sun was informed that a task team appointed by education head Enock Nzama had recommended that the school have new teachers and a principal next year. The team apparently investigated problems at the school on Friday. Sadtu provincial deputy secretary Bheki Shandu said they supported the removal of the principal, Nhlanhla Makhanya. He said: “We’ll support the recommendation to allow the school to have a new principal to provide proper leadership to all, without fear or favour.” The principal, he said, hadignored department policy and failed to guide the school governing body. The union has been at loggerheads with the principal since earlier this year. Seventeen teachers, all union members who disagreed with the principal, left the school in February. They are now reporting to the district office. Last month, the school was in the news when two pupils were killed. Apparently, this happened while they were trying to separate boys who were stabbing one another. Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said Nzamaand MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane were still studying the task team’s report. Mahlambi said they would make an announcement soon.
