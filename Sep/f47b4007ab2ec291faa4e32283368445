THESE job seekers were scammed of about R4 000 by two men who promised to find them work at Bushbuckridge Municipality. Lovey Khoza (28) and Ntiyiso Machabe (27) from Utah in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga said on 28 June, a man who identified himself as Lawrence Nkosi on the phone told them he was a human resource official at Ehlanzeni Municipality. “Lawrence said he and his colleague Lunghile Mokoena, who works at Bushbuckridge Municipality, were recruiting people for municipal internships,” said Ntiyiso. “Lawrence said we could not go wrong because he was on the panel that would be interviewing candidates. “He said I must meet Lunghile and deposit R2 650 via money market so we could be called for an interview.” Ntiyiso said on 26 July, Lawrence demanded R1 350 for accommodation and for the workshop and induction venue. “That’s when I became suspicious. “Lawrence said he had sent me a contract via email, but it never arrived. “Now the municipalities say they don’t know Lawrence or Lunghile. These fake municipal workers scammed us.” Lunghile has denied the allegations. He said Ntiyiso knew the truth. Lawrence’s phone has since been on voicemail. Maria Masuku, a spokeswoman for Bushbuckridge Municipality, said: “The two men are not municipal employees.” Captain Ndlovukazi Mashele said a case of fraud was opened. Anyone with information should call Bushbuckridge cops on 013 7995 532.
