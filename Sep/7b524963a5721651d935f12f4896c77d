IN THE old days, African people made their clothes from animal skins that identified them from other ethnic groups. Patricia Dlamini (45), who makes Zulu attire, makes isinene, ibheshu and imbatha for men. She makes isicholo hats, iwisa, ibhande, iphinifa, isidwaba and amacici for women. When the SunTeam visited her workplace in Jeppestown, Joburg, she was busy making umqhele, a springbok skin head gear. She said it took her an hour to finish one umqhele. “I need cotton wool to put inside it for bending and comfort. I must also have denim material, rope and springbok skin, which has umdlwenga for decoration as it always comes with white spots in the centre,” she said. Born in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, Patricia said umqhele can be worn by everyone, but it is popular during weddings and among traditional healers. The former domestic worker started making Zulu traditional outfits five years ago after her employer moved to the US. “I was unemployed and the only thing I was good at was preserving my culture,” she said. “I wanted to remind people where we come from as Africans. We used to dress in animal skin.” A full attire for men costs R3 000 and R1 600 for women, but one has the choice of buying the items individually. Her challenge is that some customers don’t return the hired attire, which costs R550 for a set. “Two years ago, one of my employees stole from me, and that’s why I now work alone,” said Patricia. “When I have a lot of orders, I ask my husband and kids to help me.”
