HIS good police work has led to the conviction of the most wanted men in his community. Warrant Officer Johannes Makona’s recent success saw a 40-year-old rapist jailed for life. Unfortunately, Makona of Bekkersdal cop shop will be putting away his uniform in December after 30 years of service, of which he spent 20 focused on rape cases. Speaking to Daily Sun, Makona said he felt honoured to have helped the public. “I am very proud of all my successes. I want to give other crime busters the opportunity to prove themselves.” Cop spokeswoman Sergeant Linkie Lefakane said the Westonaria Regional Court concluded the rape case against 40-year-old David Rasehlapa with life imprisonment on three counts. “The rapes were committed on 31 May 2017. Rasehlapa invited his victim, who was then 27 years old, over for supper. She agreed, but after supper he became violent and started threatening her. “He then repeatedly raped the victim and kept her in his room. The victim managed to get her cellphone from the accused and alerted her sister,” she said. Lefakane said cops were contacted and the suspect was arrested on 1 June 2017. “Makona’s hard work and professionalism in gathering evidence led to the accused being convicted and sentenced on 19 September,” she said. His manager, acting station commander Lieutenant-Colonel Florence Zondi, applauded Makona for his good work and dedication. She also thanked the prosecuting team, witnesses and the rape victim for her bravery.
