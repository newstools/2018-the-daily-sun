The EFF’s Commander-in-chief Julius Malema paid a surprise visit to a hospital in the North West! The visit took place on Thursday (27 September) at the Brits Hospital in Brits, North West. This was after residents complained about the poor service delivery they allegedly received. It was revealed that the hospital has 24 beds in the maternity ward, despite allegedly receiving more than sixty patients in a day.The EFF also alleged that four out of five fridges in the mortuary are not working. “We call on the North West Department of Health to bring about this resolution to this matter,” the EFF said. “We reiterate the fourth non-negotiable cardinal pillar and call for the state to build massive capacity in healthcare, because a collapsed public health system is the condemnation of the people to death.”
