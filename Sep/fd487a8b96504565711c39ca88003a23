WHEN Lijana Mofokeng went missing shortly after attending a relative’s funeral in Bethlehem, Free State on Saturday, his family feared the worst. Their fears became reality when the 64-year-old madala from Thokoza in Gauteng was found near a dam in Bethlehem on Tuesday. The body of the madala was discovered by a woman in the area who had gone to look for her missing geese. The woman ran back and told neighbours. Police spokesman Captain Zweli Mohobeleli said an inquest docket was opened. “No foul play is suspected. “The post mortem results will reveal the cause of death,” Mohobeleli told Daily Sun. Bethlehem cluster commander Major-General Jan Tsotetsi expressed his heartfelt condolences to madala Lijana’s family. “We’d also like to thank everyone, including the media, for their efforts in searching for the late madala Lijana when he was missing,” Tsotetsi told the People’s Paper.
