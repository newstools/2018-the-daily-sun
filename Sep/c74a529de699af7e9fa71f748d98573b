“BE AN everyday hero to people with disabilities.” This was what police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng told police and guests when they celebrated Casual Day at Welkom Sports Ground in the Free State on Friday. The campaign encouraged members of the public to contribute a small donation of R10 for a Casual Day sticker. Delivering the keynote address, Thabong station commander Brigadier Cynthia Molale said everyone was disabled in a different way. “One can be a hero everywhere, every day, at church, at work and on the streets. “We have a responsibility to love and care for others, irrespective of colour,” she said.
