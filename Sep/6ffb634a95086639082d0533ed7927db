The Springboks have recorded a famous victory, beating the All Blacks in their Rugby Championship clash in Wellington on Saturday. The Springboks won 36-34 after leading 24-17 at half-time.The home side got off to a fast start, going ahead 12-0 after 15 minutes thanks to tries by fullback Jordie Barrett and scrumhalf Aaron Smith and a conversion by flyhalf Beauden Barrett.However, the next 20 minutes were perhaps the best for the Springboks in recent times as they replied with three tries after wing Aphiwe Dyantyi, fullback Willie le Roux and hooker Malcolm Marx all dotted down. Pivot Handre Pollard was on target with all three conversions.A late try by New Zealand wing Rieko Ioane and a Pollard penalty closed proceedings for the first half.Cheslin Kolbe, a second half replacement for Lukhanyo Am, was next on the scoresheet with an intercept try which was converted by Pollard as the visitors stretched their lead once again to 14 points.But New Zealand refused to lie down, with Ioane dotting down for his second try.Not to be outdone, his counterpart Dyantyi scored his second moments later, before New Zealand hooker Codie Taylor rumbled over from a rolling maul to ensure a mouth-watering final 20 minutes.Replacement Ardie Savea then fought his way over to close to the gap to just two points, but Beauden Barrett's conversion rebounded off the upright.Rassie Erasmus' men then showed tremendous guts and determination, particularly on defence, as the reigning world champions threw everything at them in a frantic closing five minutes, but wave after wave of All Blacks attack was repelled by the Boks.Nigel Owens' final whistle was greeted with elation around the country.Teams:New Zealand15 Jordie Barrett, 14 Ben Smith, 13 Anton Lienert-Brown, 12 Ryan Crotty, 11 Rieko Ioane, 10 Beauden Barrett, 9 Aaron Smith, 8 Kieran Read (captain), 7 Sam Cane, 6 Liam Squire, 5 Scott Barrett, 4 Sam Whitelock, 3 Owen Franks, 2 Codie Taylor, 1 Karl Tu'inukuafeSubstitutes: 16 Liam Coltman, 17 Tim Perry, 18 Ofa Tu'ungafasi, 19 Patrick Tuipulotu, 20 Ardie Savea, 21 TJ Perenara, 22 Jack Goodhue, 23 Damian McKenzieSouth Africa15 Willie le Roux, 14 Jesse Kriel 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Aphiwe Dyantyi, 10 Handré Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Warren Whiteley, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Franco Mostert, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Malcolm Marx, 1 Steven KitshoffSubstitutes: 16 Bongi Mbonambi, 17 Beast Mtawarira, 18 Wilco Louw, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Francois Louw, 21 Ross Cronjé, 22 Elton Jantjies, 23 Cheslin Kolbe -Sport24
