THE councillor’s well known for his generosity. He’s adopted children and cares for the elderly. He’s a hard-working man who saved up and built his own 12-roomed house. But bad luck struck anyway! Councillor Samuel Magada (62) of Khubvi outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo, and his family on Sunday watched in disbelief as their entire house went up in flames! The house and all its contents burned to the ground. The damage is estimated at about R1,5 million. He and his family were only left with the clothes on their backs. Magada, who has no other source of income, was watching TV in the house when a man who had come to fit a bath showed him his work on his cellphone. “I decided to go and see for myself how the new bath looked. While standing there looking at the new bath, I noticed smoke coming out of the main bedroom,” he said. They rushed outside and tried to extinguish the fire, but the house was rapidly consumed by wild flames. Firefighters arrived hours later but it was too late. Magada said his family had nowhere to sleep and had sought refuge with neighbours. “I’m devastated. I don’t know what to do. I’m left with nothing. “A house that took me many years to build was destroyed in minutes,” he said. “I have no money to rebuild it.It feels as if I’m dreaming.” Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said no case was opened as the fire was caused by an electrical fault.
