THESE gogos are living in fear after their houses were destroyed by fire. But the homes of Noniza Magida (68) and Nokhaya Nanasa (83) from Duncan Village in East London were rebuilt by the human settlements department. However, the gogos said it was hard for them to enjoy life as long as the person responsible for the fire was was still roaming the streets. They said they have been having sleepless nights since May. Gogo Noniza told Daily Sun: “It was about midnight when I heard something banging on the roof. I jumped out of the bed to check what it was. I was shocked to see a fire in one of the rooms. I ran out through the kitchen door and called residents. While I was calling residents, I saw this man dancing near my house. “He was saying the witch who killed his mother, father, sister and brother must die.” She said the man was bust but later released. Gogo Nokhaya’s house also burned down in June. She said she heard her daughter screaming about a fire. “My daughter took her twin and pushed her out of the window. She also pulled me out through the window. “I could have died in the fire if my daughter wasn’t there. “I am very surprised to be accused of being a witch. I had a good relationship with the man’s mum,” said Nokhaya. Police spokeswoman Hazel Mqala said: “The case against the man (34) was provisionally withdrawn due to a lack of evidence.”
