A FAMILY from Sub 16 in Clermont, Durban is pleading with SunReaders to help them find their missing relative. Sanele Ndimande (23) went missing from his home on Friday. His sister Thobile Ndimande (30) said they were worried because he is partially deaf and can’t speak properly. “We are worried because even if he is seen by someone, he will not be able to explain who he is and where he’s from. “That’s why we are urging anyone who might have seen him to call their nearest police station,” said Thobile. She said this was the first time her brother had left home. “Most of the time he stays indoors. He is a shy person. We really don’t know what led him to leave the house this time,” said Thobile. She said they have looked everywhere in the area but couldn’t find him. She said they were planning to search local hospitals and mortuaries. “We are praying that we find him alive.” Thobile said the past few days have been tough on them as they didn’t know if Sanele was safe. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “A missing person’s docket was opened at KwaDabeka cop shop on Friday. “Sanele is still being sought by police and we are appealing to anyone who might have information to contact KwaDabeka police on 031 711 9905 or 08600 10111.”
