SuperSport United were impressive in their 4-0 defeat of Black Leopards at the Lucas Masterpieces Moripe Stadium on Sunday. James Keene, Maphosa Modiba and Evans Rusike were all on target in a relatively one-sided game where SuperSport ran out deserved winners. The home side were ahead with virtually their first attack as Keene headed in a cross from Siyabonga Nhlapo. SuperSport kept up the pressure with Fagrie Lakay just wide of the Leopards' left upright minutes later. Rusike then so nearly made it two with a header saved by King Ndlovu from a good Lakay delivery.The away side though were not without their chances, and after Phathutshedzo Nange smashed his 10th minute over the SuperSport goal, Lesedi Kapinga saw his goal-bound effort kept out by Ronwen Williams. Both Rusike and Keene continued to cause problems for the Leopards backline, while Bongani Khumalo headed just over after another swift attack. Modiba and Lakay were Matsatsantsa's main outlet from wide positions, where a number of crosses came in, before the former was able to cut inside and increase SuperSport's lead with an unstoppable left-footed effort. Leopards looked to respond and ended the half strongly, and Kapinga came close to pulling a goal back after the break with a powerful drive that flew just wide. SuperSport were forced to soak up the pressure, but always looked a threat going forward, and Modiba headed just over ahead of a 62nd effort from Kapinga that was kept out by Williams. Matsatsantsa were to add to their lead though as Rusike was able to work some space for himself before firing in past a stranded Ndlovu. Try as they might, Leopards continued to be run ragged by an expansive SuperSport side, who rounded off the scoring when Keene bagged his brace with 87 minutes on the clock. The result saw the away side lose their third successive league match, as SuperSport returned to winning ways. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
