A 50-year-old man implicated in a cash-in-transit heist in the Gingindlovu area was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment by the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Thursday. In 2014, Nicholas Mkhanyiseni Mdluli and his accomplices attacked security guards who were transporting cash. "They fired shots at the vehicle until it halted, they then poured petrol over the vehicle threatening to burn it and ordered security guards to come out," Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said. "They robbed them of their firearms and made off with an undisclosed amount of cash." A shootout between the suspects and police ensued and one arrest was made. Hawks members subsequently followed up on information and a second accused, Salakuliwa Welcome Msimango was arrested. Three unlicensed firearms and ammunition were found in Msimango's possession. Mdluli was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment for robbery and 10 years' imprisonment for attempted murder. Msimango was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for the possession of unlicensed firearms. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/kzn-robber-sentenced-to-25-years-for-cash-in-transit-heist-20180921
