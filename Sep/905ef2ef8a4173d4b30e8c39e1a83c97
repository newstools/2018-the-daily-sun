“SURPRISE! It’s a baby!” These were the last words gogo Dudu Mthethwa expected to hear as she was trying to catch her breath after church on Sunday. The 60-year-old gogo from Fountain of Love, an orphanage home in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni said that’s how she learnt of a newborn baby found in the toilet. “Some of the kids went to the toilet after coming back from church. When they came back, they told me that they had a surprise.” The curious gogo waited to find out what the surprise was. “They went to the toilet and returned with a newborn baby and shouted ‘Surprise!’ as they handed the baby to me.” The baby had been placed nicely on a towel in the toilet. The gogo suspects that the person who left the child there lives in the area or know the area very well. Gogo Dudu said it wasn’t the first time this had happened at her orphanage. She said one of the 14-year-old children in her care was left in a similar manner when he was seven months old. “Why do our mothers do this to us?” asked gogo Dudu. She pleaded with the mother of the child to come and fetch her baby because the child didn’t have a birth certificate with him. Dudu has about 44 children in the family house she turned into a home for orphans. Police spokesman Captain Lesetja Mathobela said a child neglect case was registered for investigation. The baby, who was named Sibusiso, will stay with gogo Dudu until cops finish their investigation.
