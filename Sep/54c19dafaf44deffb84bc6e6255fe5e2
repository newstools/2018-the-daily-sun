SUNPOWER has done it again! Mercy Nkomo from Eersterust, near Hammanskraal in Tshwane, now has a new ID. The 43-year-old’s ID was taken away from her last month after she visited Home Affairs. She said she went to apply for an ID for her 16-year-old daughter Faith but ended up losing hers. She claimed officials told her she would never get her ID back. “They said I was a foreigner and wasn’t supposed to have a document.” Mercy said she was born in Zimbabwe but had been living in Mzansi since 1990. “I came here with my dad because he was the only family I had. I got married and had five children here,” she said. She said the officials told her to go back to Zimbabwe. But after Daily Sun published her story at the beginning of the month, Home Affairs promised to help her. She applied for a new document and it was issued to her. Mercy said she was happy the People’s Paper came to her rescue. When the first story was published, Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola promised to help and he kept his word.
