TWO construction workers died after the truck they were travelling in hit a wall and overturned. They were on their way to work on Monday morning when the incident happened in Northridge, Bloemfontein. Police said the truck was carrying 28 passengers when it crashed. The truck driver lost control and hit the wall. Two people died on the scene and one person is in a critical condition at Pelonomi Hospital, while 25 others escaped with minor injuries. Jaws of life had to be used to free the driver from the crashed truck. A witness said: “It looks like the driver lost control. When the truck rolled, people flew into the air and landed on the road. “Some were trapped after the truck overturned. I know the people who were in the truck. We work together.” Another witness said: “I saw the truck speeding and hit the wall. The passengers were screaming. It was sad. I came to help them. “Owners of construction companies should stop using trucks to transport workers.” Police spokesman Thabo Covane said police are investigating a case of culpable homicide.
