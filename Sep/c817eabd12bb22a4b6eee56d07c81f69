WHILE most people see rain as a blessing and an end to the drought, residents of Ekuthuleni Village in Melmoth, KZN said for them the rainy season is a nightmare. That’s because their gravel roads get muddy and slippery as soon as the heavens open. A resident, Zanele Ntuli (43) told Daily Sun that they asked their councillor to have the road tarred but he didn’t respond to their requests. “All our roads are in a terrible state. On rainy days it’s tough for drivers and for those of us who walk. “The gravel road gets muddy and slippery. Most villagers don’t go anywhere on rainy days,” she said. Another resident told Daily Sun that his car was damaged on the gravel road. “There is no alternative road to use. We are forced to drive on the gravel roads which are all in terrible condition. “There are not a lot of cars in our area but still the roads are bad,” he said. He said the terrible roads were also littered with potholes that caused damage. “Our only wish is to see our roads tarred and then we will be happy,” he said. Mthonjaneni municipal spokesman Senzo Mbatha said the issue of gravel roads was one of many issues faced by their municipality. “The municipality is only responsible for small roads. “The bigger roads like the one you are enquiring about is the responsibility of the department of transport. We are in constant talks with them regarding these big roads but we have not been able to come to a tangible agreement yet,” he said.
