MANGOSUTHU Buthelezi has said the killing of people on suspicion of witchcraft should be condemned in the strongest terms. He was speaking at the memorial lecture for legendary sangoma Nobhiyana Madonda at the Msunduzi Museum in Pietermaritzburg, KZN, on Wednesday. The IFP leader said Madonda passed King Shaka’s test when he correctly named the king as the person who had smeared blood in a hut. Shaka had smeared the blood and asked sangomas to identify the culprit in an attempt to separate real diviners from fake ones. “The terrible reality is 190 years after King Shaka’s death, there are still sangomas who point out innocent people as witches and wizards. There are still acts of mob violence in which these people are murdered. As a leader, I have condemned this evil,” he said. However, Buthelezi was at pains to stress he was not condemning the practices of sangomas as he was not an expert in their field. “But since they cause harm to innocent people, I must speak out,” he said. Buthelezi said Madonda, whose grave is in Vulindlela, should be remembered for his courage and celebrated, especially in Heritage Month. “What he did was exceptional on several counts. Pointing out the king as the culprit put Madonda at imminent risk of death.” Buthelezi said if Madonda had remained silent, many people would have died and corrupt sangomas would have caused many innocent people to be killed. The lecture was hosted jointly by the Msunduzi Pietermaritzburg Tourism Association and Msunduzi Museum to celebrate Heritage Month. Speaking on behalf of the legendary sangoma’s family, his great-grandson Phumlani Madonda said they were honoured that Buthelezi was speaking about their ancestor and his importance in Zulu history.
