THE University of Venda auditorium bust into applause when reggae veteran Colbert Mukwevho was called to the podium  during the graduation ceremony on Friday. Mukwevho was awarded with an honorary doctorate in arts and social sciences. The musician, who has more than 200 songs and 20 albums under his belt, gave a great performance of songs that made him famous. He left many people, including academics and graduates’ parents, eating out of the palm of his hand when he and his band performed two famous songs from his previous albums. He joins the likes of top Tsonga musician Thomas Chauke and late king musician Phillip Tabane, who were honoured by the university. Born in a musical family in 1965, Mukwevho joined his father and uncle’s band The Thrilling Artists in 1975. He started off as a backing singer and later as a bassist and lead singer. In his acceptance speech, Mukwevho said he was humbled by the honour and urged the students and youth to hold on to their dreams. Mukwevho said as an artist, he was just doing his work, not knowing that people were looking. “I’m grateful to the university for this honorary doctorate,” he told the People’s Paper.
