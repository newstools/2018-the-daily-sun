THEY’RE always fighting, their money never lasts, their kids don’t listen . . . and things go bump in the night. This has been the Moraneng family’s hell for the past 20 years. Martin (56) and his wife Gloria (45) from Refilwe, east of Tshwane, said they have moved to three different houses but still the tokoloshe keeps following them. Martin said the evil beast made different sounds on the roof every day and at night it goes to bed with them. “We don’t know what the tokoloshe wants but it is making our life a living hell.” He said they were always fighting, couldn’t keep money and their kids wouldn’t listen to them. “This tokoloshe has turned itself into our God. It is controlling our life!” he said. Gloria said she was always ill. “I sometimes wake up with bleeding scratches on my legs. Whenever I’m in my house I feel ill but as soon as I walk out of the gate, the sickness goes away,” she said. Gloria said the sounds on the roof always started when her husband entered the house. “We have been to sangomas and different kinds of churches. They all came here and performed their rituals but as soon as they’re gone, the tokoloshe comes back.” She said they couldn’t move again. “We’ve lived in shacks, big houses and small. We can’t continue running. It gets worse whenever we move,” she said. She said their last hope lay was with SunReaders. “We know that there is someone out there who can help.” Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said: “A sangoma needs to send the tokoloshe back to its owner. They also need to be cleansed.”
