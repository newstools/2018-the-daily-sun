ARE you kicking dust over your broken lawnmower? Is your faulty compressor leaving you red in the face? If the answer is yes, it’s time to call Mohale Mohala, Mangaung’s resident handyman. The 32-year-old has been fixing appliances and motorbikes since 2011. Mohale said he started working as an assistant mechanic at the local motorcycle shop in Bloemfontein. “I fell in love with the job and decided to buy myself a motor bike so I could teach myself how to disassemble and put things back together. After I learnt everything about a bike’s wiring and engine, I decided to work on my own. “Now I have many clients who are happy with my service. “My knowledge has expanded and I’m now capable of identifying most problems just by turning on the bike’s ignition,” he said. He said it took up to three days to overhaul an engine. “I also repair broken chainsaws, generators, compressors and lawnmowers. “I hope one day someone will invest in my business and help me put up a shade port.” Customer Lehlohonolo Nkhati said he was happy his quad bike was fixed by Mohale. “He knows what he’s doing,” said Lehlohonolo.
