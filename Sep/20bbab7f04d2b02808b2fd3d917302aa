HIV is a big issue is SA and safe sex helps one stay clear of the virus. But using condoms doesn't have to put a damper on your pleasure. Choosing the right brand and fit can help one feel more comfortable with the usage of condoms and can even be more pleasurable. Here are ways to make condoms more fun: 1. Shop for the right size When buying condoms, take your time and choose the right size. Remember a size too big for your 4-5 will slip off and expose you to the risk of being infected with STDs. 2. Try different designs The boxes normally show the type of design the condom has inside. The swirls and bulbs usually fit well at the base of the 4-5 shaft while creating room for more friction on the sensitive nerve. 3. Be quick when opening the packaging The moment of waiting while the condom is unwrapped can be long and awkward and sometimes even ruin the romantic moment. 4. Add Lube After opening the condom place two drops of lube inside. This increases sensation at the super sensitive head of the 4-5. 5. Add a vibrating ring A vibrating ring is a plastic band attached to a buzzing nub. Place the band around the base of the condom, with the nub facing the clitoris and enjoy the pulsating ride.
