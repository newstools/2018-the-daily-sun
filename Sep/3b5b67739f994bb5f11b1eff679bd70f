COPS patrolled outside Pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng’s Incredible Happenings Church yesterday. Mboro said this was because he received threats that his church would be shut down. He claimed threats were made by the members of a WhatsApp group called Open Politics. This comes after Mboro opened a case of defamation of character against some group members on Thursday. Daily Sun is in possession of voice recordings and WhatsApp messages of insults. At the time, the group said Mboro was seeking attention and was a media junkie. They said they would not entertain him. Mboro said the group targeted his church. “The police have been monitoring my church. We take the threats very seriously and the church is looking into upgrading the security. Meanwhile, church members are ready to defend themselves and the church against any attempts to close it. “Members of the group said they want to protect church members against me because I’m a false prophet. They said they are coming to fight, destroy and shut the church,” said Mboro. He said he joined the group in April and was removed last Tuesday and put back again on Friday. He said he was later removed after being insulted again. After the church service, Mboro approached Katlehong Police Station to open a case of intimidation against the group for allegedly threatening the church. Police spokeswoman Captain Buyisile Mvelase said a case of intimidation has been opened.
