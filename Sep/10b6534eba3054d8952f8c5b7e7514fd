Media personality Lerato Kganyago has exposed a Zimbabwean man who has been stalking her for the past few months. The man goes by the name Gerald K and has been sending Kganyago a number of WhatsApp messages and creepy videos. Kganyago, who is understandably shaken by the ordeal, has taken to social media to share some of the creepy videos and messages she has been receiving. While she says she had been reluctant to share this information publically, the situation is starting to get out of hand. “He has been harassing me, and has changed numbers more than seven time each time I’ve blocked,” Kganyago shared in a series of Insta Stories. “Everytime I block his number, he gets a new one. I’m terrified because this is getting out hand. “He sends me videos speaking gibberish. “Im not one to get scared, but this has me crying.” Kganyago has opened a case against the man and has issued a warning to other ladies saying the man seems “unstable.” Check out the screen-grabs below:
