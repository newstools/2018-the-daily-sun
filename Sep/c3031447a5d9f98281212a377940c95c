THE smell of sewage and unhealthy living conditions are the order of the day at Skiet 1 squatter camp in Butterworth. Residents said the sewer pipes were always leaking. Bonga Mthotyana (28) said life had been difficult for squatters since 2006. “For the past 12 years, we’ve been experiencing kak smell and blocked drains in the area,” he said. “I often fall sick because of the smell. We’re forced to live here because we don’t have a choice. “Old sewarage pipes may be the cause of this mess. Next year we may not vote.” Bonga said the municipality was letting them down. Another resident, Zameka Njeza (36), said: “It’s normal to live with sewage in front of our doors. “We’re at risk of getting sick because of this mess. “We hope the municipality will urgently resolve this matter.” Mnquma municipal spokesman Loyiso Mpalantshane said: “The municipality is saddened to hear about the plight of Skiet 1 people. “We hope for a speedy resolution to their current situation. “But water and sanitation provision and technical expertise are the responsibility of the Amathole Municipality.”
