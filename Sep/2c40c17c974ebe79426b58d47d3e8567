T he  community of Phuthaditjhaba in QwaQwa has signed a pledge to raise awareness about Foetal Alcohol Syndrome. They also vowed to support pregnant women and girls. The pledge was part of deputy minister of social development Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu’s 999 campaign. It aimed to educate communities about the dangers of boozing during pregnancy, which includes giving birth to babies with the condition. Bogopane-Zulu visited the area on Tuesday. She urged women to put their babies first. “Boys and girls were asked to pledge not to visit taverns while parents were asked to pledge not to allow their children to drink alcohol,” said Bogopane-Zulu. Vusi Tshabalala, mayor of Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality, said they would ensure illegal taverns and those that sold booze to young people were shut down. Mafusi Litali (32), a pregnant woman, said she was aware booze destroyed families. The awareness campaign is expected to roll out throughout the country.
