Top Model, Rosette Ncwana has been in Thailand serving up some heat while on a work trip over the past week. The model and socialite is in Ko Samui, one of Thailand’s biggest islands, shooting a campaign for World Swimsuit. World Swimsuit is a swimwear publication that features the “world's most beautiful swimsuit models, shot by the best photographers, in exotic locations, across the globe”. Rosette is among the world’s sexiest models in the world who will be featured in the magazine, including our Miss SA, Tamaryn Green. She is having so much fun that she has expressed her wish to live on the island forever. Although she is staying at the luxurious Ritz-Carlton hotel, her shoot has taken her to CoCo Tam's, the Fisherman's Village and the sandy beaches of Ko Sumai.
