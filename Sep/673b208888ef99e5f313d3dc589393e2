A DA councillor was allegedly manhandled by party supporters for attending a council meeting. Nelson Mandela Bay ward 35 Councillor Trevor Louw was apparently attacked on Friday by DA supporters. This after he defied the party’s call to boycott the council meeting, which the DA, Cope, ACDP and PA had labelled illegal. Louw and ward 37 Councillor Neville Higgins were the only DA councillors who attended the meeting and helped a new coalition adopt a motion to take disciplinary action against former mayor Athol Trollip. This was for allegedly leaking a confidential council report to DA leader Mmusi Maimane. “I came here to hand over my resignation letter but before I could do that, DA supporters grabbed me and forcefully took my bag, which had my letter in it. “I took this conscious decision because I want to look after my family and my health,” said Louw.” Speaker Buyelwa Mafaya refused to acknowledge the letter which she received from city manager Johann Mettler. She declared it null and void. “I can’t accept the letter because it’s from a third party. Louw needs to hand it to me personally.”
