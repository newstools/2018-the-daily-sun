FIRST it was meals on wheels that got people talking. But residents of Joko Tea squatter camp in the Vaal, south of joburg, have something even better. They have their very own spaza on foot! John Sithole is the clever seller who came up with the bright idea. He carries a big load on his shoulders selling anything from cosmetics, detergents, pot scourers and even shoes. John’s loved by his customers because he brings his wares right to their doorstep. Happy customer Dorah Mnisi said she sometimes didn’t have money but John let her take things on credit and she paid him at the end of the month. Another one of John’s happy customers is Sifiso Ndamase, who stays alone. He said he often forgot to buy things like scourers when he went shopping. “This man helps me a lot because he brings these items right to my doorstep. I cook, clean and do most of the things around my shack,” he said. John told Daily Sun he walked long distances every day. “If I don’t do this my family will go hungry. I got used to the load and I don’t feel it anymore.” He said having customers who bought his things soon made his load lighter. “The burden would definitely weigh me down if there were no people to buy my things,” he said. John has been providing this service to residents for five years. “I worked in construction but with that kind of job there are seasons where there’s no work. “I could see myself starving and I had to do something.” He said he didn’t only sell in one squatter camp but visited others, too. The only disadvantage is walking long distances and when it rains.
