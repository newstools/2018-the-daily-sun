POLICE at Bloemspruit cop shop are unhappy with their bosses. The cops from the station in Mangaung told Daily Sun they had been told not to drive state cars in order to save fuel, leaving them unable to respond to criminal complaints. However, top cops said the measures were put in place to prevent cops from abusing state vehicles. A detective said: “We can’t attend to crimes such as murder because we don’t have cars. We can’t go and charge arrested suspects because we’re told to save petrol. “I think our department is going down the drain and I’m sure the national office is not aware.” Free State police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said they were aware of the measures. “It’s the responsibility of each and every manager to see to it that they manage the budget allocated to them properly. If the manager realises there’s a possibility the allocated budget will be overspent, they will put measures in place to prevent it. “It’s unfortunate there are members who want to use state cars full time to the extent they end up misusing them. The public keeps complaining of cars being misused.” He said if cops feel they can’t do their job, they know the proper channels to follow. An investigating officer asked why those misusing cars are not dealt with directly. “The ones suffering the most are members of the community,” he said.
