THE first court appearance of Kessie Nair has been delayed. It emerged in the Verulam Magistrates Court, north of Durban, yesterday that he was taken to Mahatma Gandhi Hospital for a mental health assessment. Nair used the k-word in a self-filmed video directed at President Cyril Ramaphosa. He is facing a charge of crimen injuria after a former eThekwini councillor, Brandon Pillay, opened a case against him at Bayview cop shop. After two hours of arguing between Nairâ€™s lawyer Chris Gounden, prosecutor San Bhartu and magistrate Irfaan Khallil, the case was postponed to 26 September for a formal bail application. Gounden was trying to get bail for Nair but the state opposed it, saying it needed time to process bail application evidence as it emerged that Nair had various addresses.
