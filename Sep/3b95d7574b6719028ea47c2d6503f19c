Police have made one arrest in connection with the gunning down of an off-duty Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officer in Hillbrow, JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said. "I can confirm that we have arrested one suspect and we are working on information to lead us to the arrest of the second suspect," Minnaar said. He was unable to give more information about the incident or reveal the officer's identity. Minnaar added that the SA Police Service (SAPS) and JMPD were also working on information that could lead to the recovery of the officer's service pistol. The City of Johannesburg has since condemned the act, saying it was an attack on the City's "efforts to return the rule of law" in Johannesburg. "It is an attack on our residents, who are desperate to feel safe in their homes, communities and streets. We will not let unscrupulous criminals hold us to ransom. The City is working with law enforcement authorities to ensure that no stone is left unturned in apprehending these criminals," Mayor Herman Mashaba said in a statement. Mashaba has sent his condolences to the family of the officer and has also urged residents who have further information about the incident to come forward. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/one-arrested-for-killing-of-off-duty-jmpd-officer-20180913
