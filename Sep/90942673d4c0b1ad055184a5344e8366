DURBAN kwaito star Mampintsha believes that a relationship with God is important. His belief is so strong that he has called on other gqom artists and the nation to join him at church. Mampintsha, whose real name is Mandla Maphumulo, released a video in which he talks about opening a church called West Ink Baptist Church. This comes after he released a single last month called Siyabathandazela. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mampintsha said he was calling on other gqom artists to join him in praise and worship. He said he called the movement West Ink Baptist Church because the experience of attending church is life-changing. Mampintsha aims to grab the youth of Durban and pray for them as the church will have many pastors from various churches. “It is much better when I am the one inviting the youth to come to church. “I believe they will come in numbers and will also come to our events when we perform,” he said. He said artists must lead by example. “I go to churches and listen to the word of God,” he said. “Sometimes churches invite me and I go and attend. “ think gqom artists also need to go to church so they can get spiritual guidance.” Mampintsha says he believes that anyone can change, especially under the umbrella of a church. However, he made it clear that he was not starting an actual church.
