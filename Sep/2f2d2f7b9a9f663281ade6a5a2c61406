“ALCOHOL has ruined our lives and the lives of people around us. We promise to remain an alcohol-free generation.” This was the message from pupils who attended the launch of the #AwareofTomorrow campaign by the Department of Social Development and Association for Alcohol Responsibility and Education. The event was held at the OR Tambo Conference Centre in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni yesterday. The campaign aims to create a culture of responsible alcohol consumption in South Africa. It will focus on areas such as underage and binge drinking and Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Mandisa Khanyile from the #TheTotalShutdown movement said: “Alcohol abuse is one the biggest contributors to gender-based violence.” She also talked about the role alcohol advertising played in increasing the amount of alcohol consumed. Ingrid Louw, CEO of the campaign, said they noticed how it had become quite normal for pregnant women to consume alcohol. “We know the dangers of alcohol consumption on the development of a foetus. “So we partnered with the department to create a campaign to create more awareness on the dangers of the Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder,” said Louw. “It is not only the responsibility of pregnant women but the community to ensure pregnant women don’t consume alcohol.” Louw said: “We’ve decided to do away with the old way of advertising, where alcohol was advertised as aspirational, especially to the youth. We’ve adopted a more responsible way of promoting the products.” Social Development deputy minister Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu said changing human behaviour was a long-term commitment. “We all have to play an active role to beat the scourge of alcohol abuse.”
