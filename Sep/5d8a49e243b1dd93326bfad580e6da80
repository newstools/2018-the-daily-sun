GONE are the days when kids would behave when in their school uniforms. That’s according to concerned parents in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. They say they’ve had enough of kids kissing and touching in public. Zanele Magudulela (28) told Daily Sun she had tried numerous times to stop kids from kissing in public, but failed. “I try to break them up and tell them to stop, but it seems my words are falling on deaf ears,” said Zanele. She said at some point she held a meeting with pupils who live in her street to advise them about public indecency, but they didn’t seem to care. “I have given up. These kids are uncontrollable,” she added. Aaron Mtsweni (78) said when he saw kids kissing and touching near his yard, he fires stones at them with a slingshot. “I never allowed my kids do this. This generation is messed up.” Elizabeth Moloi (41) said she once caught her daughter kissing some guy while she was wearing her uniform and she was furious. “I warned her never to do that again. “But it seems she didn’t care because later that week she was again seen kissing someone in public while wearing her uniform,” Elizabeth told the People’s Paper. She pleaded with government to intervene. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has urged parents to play a role in assisting the department discipline pupils in and outside the school environment. He said this after a video clip showed another pupil from Hammanskraal using foul language and promoting sexual activities. He said the department was speaking to former pupils to create a mentorship programme that would assist in promoting good conduct.
