THE ANC has said more jobs need to be created. This came after it emerged on Tuesday that the country had slipped into a technical recession, which the party said should push all South Africans to rally around a common vision to grow the economy.

Godongwana said all production sectors except for mining were shrinking. “These developments happen in the context of an economy that continues to experience low growth. “The slow growth challenges require a coherent and a multifaceted response to ensure that our economy is strengthened to provide decent work,” he said. The party called for the following interventions: He said these interventions did not necessarily require the development of new policies but rather the effective implementation of existing ones.
