SHERWOOD squatter camp in Durban has over 150 residents who live in 41 shacks. And they all use one tap! Resident Zandile Dlamini (26) told Daily Sun: “If you want to be in the front, you need to wake up very early in the morning to avoid standing in a long queue.” She said the same thing happened in the evenings. “People who leave early in the morning for work only get a chance to fetch water in the evening,” said Zandile. She said they tried making illegal connections but it made things worse, as it caused water not to come out of the tap at all. “We were stranded. We didn’t know where to get water so we disconnected the connections.” She said they wished eThekwini Municipality would give them more taps. “The municipality can organise a few tanks to be filled weekly. I believe this would make a big difference,” said Zandile. Mandla Nsele, eThekwini acting spokesman, said: “Thank you for bringing the matter to our attention. The relevant unit visited the area and confirmed there is water and that there was no problem with the water supply. “We ask residents to contact their ward councillor so they can point out the affected parts of the settlement. The councillor will then send us a formal request.”
