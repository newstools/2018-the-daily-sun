Justice has been served! This after Sibukei Mthembu (25) was sentenced to 35 years
for rape, house robbery and armed robbery at the Pietermaritzburg Regional
Court on 26 September. On 21 august 2014, around midnight, a 22-year-old victim
was sleeping with her family in their homestead at Richmond, when two men
entered their house. They then demanded money and cellphones from the family
members and at knifepoint they raped the 22-year-old. Charges of house robbery, armed robbery and rape were opened
at Richmond SAPS and the docket was transferred to Plessislaer Family Violence,
Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for investigation. The investigating officer managed to trace the suspect
and he was later arrested. He was denied bail and was kept in custody until his
sentencing. He was sentenced to five years for house robbery, 15 years for
armed robbery and 15 years for rape. The second suspect
is still at large.
