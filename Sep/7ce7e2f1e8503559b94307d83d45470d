AGRICULTURE MEC Themba Mthembu believes self-enriching parasites have given his department a bad name. Mthembu said this in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday. A major challenge faced by his department, said the MEC, were the parasitic networks that had caused damage. “There appears to be visible footprints of a captured department by the parasitic network with strong connections inside the department,” he said. He also singled out leadership challenges at both political and administrative level. Mthembu said the department has had a record seven MECs and 10 department heads in the past 20 years. “This instability has destroyed the department,” the MEC told the People’s Paper. “The average time that each MEC and HOD spent on the job was a minimum of 24 months.” Mthembu said this had negatively affected organisational culture, professionalism, work ethics and service delivery. And the instability had made it easy for opportunists to use the department’s resources for their own selfish gain. According to the MEC, the department was now implementing corrective measures following the auditor-general’s report and as a result of forensic investigations. Mthembu told Daily Sun this had unsettled a lot of people and resulted in the department getting negative publicity. He said they were working hard, but correcting the damage that had occurred over the past 10 years was a big task. He asked stakeholders to exercise patience.
