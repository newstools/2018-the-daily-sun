Another challenge has surfaced on social media. In it, people, especially women, from other countries are shown lying on the ground near either a jet or an expensive car as if they tripped while trying to get out. Their expensive items could also been scattered around. Man's Not Barry Roux tweeted that : "This challenge is too much for SA Slay queens. South Africa Slay Queens Sit Y'all A**'s down." However, Mzansi found its own way to make the #SlayQueenChallenge work! The infamous Black Twitter shared pictures of themselves doing the #SlayQueenChallengeâ€” some used wheelbarrows, bicycles and toy cars!
