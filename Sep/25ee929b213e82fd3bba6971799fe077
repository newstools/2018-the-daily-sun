MARATHON legend Josiah Thugwane feels on top of the world today. The 1996 Olympic Games gold medallist cannot stop smiling after he was given the highest honour by Athletics South Africa (ASA) and the Mpumalanga Athletics Federation. That is because runners will be competing in the Josia Thugwane SA 10km Championships at the Kees Taljaard Stadium in Middelburg on Saturday. The retired athlete was honoured at the Berlin Marathon in Germany in 2017, when his face was displayed on the medals given to the participating athletes at the end of the race. A prominent American company has also given the living legend a two-year deal to promote its races. But Thugwane had felt neglected by his own country for many years despite his efforts to put Mzansi on the map – while international communities have long heralded him for his achievements. But he has finally been recognised after ASA decided to name the national 10km champs after him. He said the feeling of getting recognition was indescribable. “The organisers called me and I gave them permission to name the race after me. It’s good to be recognised while you are still alive,” he said. “Germany and other countries abroad take me seriously but I was nothing in my own country. I’m grateful for this moment and hope that more honours will come my way before I die.” Thugwane says in South Africa, legends are not celebrated while they are still alive. He said: ‘The top administrators in sport don’t care about legends in this country, they only care about politics and enriching themselves. I hope this will change.”
