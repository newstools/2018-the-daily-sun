A TEENAGER accused of assaulting a gogo has been ordered to give the victim’s family two goats and a cow. The 19-year-old from Hlabisa, northern KZN, has been instructed to deliver the animals to induna Jabulani Mdletshe as soon as possible to apologise for the humiliation she caused gogo Cabangile Ngcobo (69). Mdletshe said they wanted to set an example to all youngsters in the village that elders should be respected. “I want her to learn a lesson she will never forget. This is a disgrace in our village,” he said. Mdletshe said he understood the girl was still at school but her parents had to help her buy the cow and two goats. The video that led to the girl’s arrest started circulating on social media last Tuesday. She was arrested the next day and appeared in the Hluhluwe Magistrates Court on Thursday and granted free bail. She was expected to appear in court again in two weeks’ time for the beginning of her trial. Gogo Cabangile told Daily Sun she was beaten for her cool drink. She said she was happy the community was supporting her. “I’m happy the village leadership punished the girl for what she did to me. As much as this brings peace to my heart, I’m eagerly waiting for the court ruling as this matter is now before a magistrate. “I will be glad if the law takes its course because I also want to see her suffer like I did.”
