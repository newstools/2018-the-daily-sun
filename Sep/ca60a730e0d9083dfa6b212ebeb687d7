NELSON Mandela Bay Municipality has confirmed it will defend the DA’s case against last month’s controversial council meeting. On Friday, the DA, Cope, the ACDP and the Patriotic Alliance filed papers in the Port Elizabeth High Court to have the motion of no confidence in former mayor Athol Trollip set aside. Trollip was replaced by the UDM’s Mongameli Bobani after DA Councillor Mbulelo Manyathi abstained from voting. Bobani said: “The meeting was legal. We have read the DA affidavit. It is based on a wish list and gossip. They don’t have a case. “We have received advice from our legal team that we must not make any further comments about this issue because it will jeopardise our case.” Bobani said when a new administration took power, it should be allowed to come up with new plans and a new vision. “In this regard, the new mayoral committee will engage with the municipality directorate to look at current plans and develop new plans,” he said. Bobani said based on complaints from the public, it was clear there were a number of problems with the municipality’s billing system. “An intervention was clearly necessary and the leadership has introduced senior staff in the budget and treasury departments. “A comprehensive audit will be undertaken to get to the bottom of this challenge and introduce corrective measures as a matter of urgency.”
