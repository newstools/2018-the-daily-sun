A GIRL’S life is a mess after she was raped and
impregnated by her father. And while her version of events was that he brutally beat
her while he raped her, he claims to have fallen in love with her. According to Punch, the horror unfolded in Lagos, Nigeria
earlier this year. The father was finally bust last week when his daughter
told her stepmum that she was two months pregnant – and that the baby daddy was
her own father. In a statement to the cops, the father said: “Sometime in
June 2018, my wife informed me that my daughter was pregnant after which we
both called her to ask who was responsible for the pregnancy. She did not say
anything, but I knew that I was the one who impregnated her and it happened in
June. I fell in love with her and had sex with her two times.” The fifteen-year-old girl’s version is a hideous
combination of neglect and violent abuse. She said, “My stepmother always accused me of stealing
her money and most times she moered me. Sometime in June, my stepmother accused
me of stealing her N200 (about R8,50) and said I should not go to school. “While I was doing the house chores, my daddy brought out
a wire and started beating me. As he was beating me, he ordered me to sit on
the bed and remove my pants. I initially refused, but as he continued beating
me, I obeyed him and he raped me.” The violence and raping continued until June, when the
girl missed her period and realised she was pregnant. Her father begged her to
lie and say she was raped by someone in the nearby hotel, but she finally told
her stepmum the truth. The father has been charged with rape and will appear in
court on 3 October.
