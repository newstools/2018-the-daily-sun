THE deadly fire on Wednesday in the Bank of Lisbon building in the heart of the Joburg CBD was a ticking time-bomb that finally exploded. . . but it isn’t the only worry. New information has emerged that eight buildings belonging to the provincial government do not comply with safety regulations. Scores of employees in provincial government departments working in these buildings are wondering about their safety. Employees of the department of education chanted outside their building in Fox Street to express their fears. An employee told Daily Sun employees were moved in 2016 from a building at 111 Commissioner Street to a new building at 55 Fox Street. A source said they didn’t go into the new offices following failed discussions between unions and management. “In September last year employees were removed from the building by their unions. We were out of the building for four months but we were forced back by the executives,” said an employee. “All we want is for government to take us seriously and make sure their employees are safe.” Mashaba said the city was determined to fast track the demolition of unsafe buildings occupied by vagrants and illegal residents in the city centre. “We are breaking these buildings down, not because we are heartless but to avoid these kinds of disasters. “For me these are not accidents. This is something that is totally avoidable and cannot be called an accident.” The mayor promised to continue working with the provincial government to provide safe housing for city residents.
