Our favorite queen of the dance floor Zodwa Wabantu is one of the hardest working entertainers in the local entertainment industry. That is why her star has been on the rise ever since she burst onto the scene a few years ago. While she splits opinion, there is no denying her drive and determination as she has made a name for herself in the entertainment scene against all odds. The dance floor is not the only place Zodwa works hard, she recently shared a video showing just how hard she works to keep her body in shape. The controversial dancer often refers to her body as “the body that has money,” and she seems to be taking good care of it as a result. The video shared on Instagram shows her working out in her underwear, in true Zodwa fashion. “Mzimba Onemali awukhathali (the body that has money doesn’t get tired),” she captioned the workout video, “We not fixing anything here, my machines at my own comfort, space. Sehlisa amafutha kuphel (we’re only reducing fat).” Mzimba Onemali awukhathali?? We not fixing anything here #Body #Mine #Fat #Cullulite ???‍?? My Machines at my own Comfort,Space. Sehlisa amafutha kuphela???????????????‍??????? A post shared by  zodwalibram (@zodwalibram) on Sep 6, 2018 at 6:47am PDT
