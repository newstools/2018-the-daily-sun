ITUMELENG MORE’s a broken woman since her brother disappeared in May. The 64-year-old from Hebron near Ga-Rankuwa in Tshwane needs SunReaders’ help to find him. She said something strange happened before her brother Letlhogonolo vanished. She spilled water on the floor while she and the family were watching TV. Her daughter asked Letlhogonolo to move so she could mop the floor. He went outside and never came back. “We thought he had gone outside for fresh air, but we got worried when there was no sign of him outside.” She said the next day her neighbour told her she had seen Letlhogonolo five streets away, looking lost. “My brother has dementia and doesn’t remember most things. I’m sure he doesn’t remember where home is,” she said. Itumeleng said they have searched everywhere for him, with no success. “We went to hospitals, mortuaries and police stations but still haven’t found him,” she said. She said ever since Letlhogonolo went missing, she stays awake at night hoping he will knock on the door. “I feel empty not knowing if he’s safe or not. He’s not returned home. I’ll never be at peace until he’s found,” she said. A missing person’s case was opened at Hebron Police Station.
