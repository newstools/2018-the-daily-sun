MATLHOMOLA Mosweu died over five sunflower heads worth about R80. This came to light as the two men accused of killing the 16-year-old were cross-examined in the North West High Court in Mahikeng yesterday. The case of Phillip Schutte (34) and Pieter Doorewaard (27) will continue on 25 September. The death of Matlhomola in May last year caused violent protests in the small North West town of Coligny. The protests led to the police opening a case against the two men who allegedly murdered the boy. They are facing charges of murder, intimidation, theft and pointing of a firearm. Matlhomola was allegedly thrown from a moving bakkie by the two while they were patrolling Rietvlei farm, Coligny. Key witness Bonakele Papiki claimed that he saw the men throwing the boy from the bakkie and then picking him up again once they realised they had been spotted. They allegedly drove about 47km around farms with Bonakele, shooting a gun in his direction and threatening to kill him while Matlhomola was lying bleeding on the back of the bakkie. They later allegedly dumped Bonakele on the side of the road and went to the police station. State advocate Moeketsi Moeketsi wanted to know why the two refused to go to the scene with cops. Schutte said police took their cellphone numbers and said they would call them. He said he was too deep in shock to think of going back. Judge Ronald Hendricks postponed the case to 25 September for final argument and possible judgment.
