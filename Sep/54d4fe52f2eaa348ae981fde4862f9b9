BY-ELECTIONS in ward 20 in Nelson Mandela Bay have been delayed for the second time this year. This is after convicted ANC Ward 20 councillor Bongo Nombiba (43) of KwaZakhele kasi in Port Elizabeth was found guilty of embezzlement in March. He was found guilty of robbing the municipality of R20 000 meant for the Thulamangwane Community Project. Nombiba was sentenced to five years but appealed his sentence. By-elections for the ward were scheduled for 25 July, after he lost his first appeal in the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court. And when Nombiba’s legal team lodged a second appeal at Makhanda High Court, they were postponed again. But he lost the appeal on 13 July and was ordered to hand himself over to prison authorities within seven days. ANC regional secretary Themba Xathula told Daily Sun: “There will be no by-elections in ward 20. Comrade Bongo is appealing his sentence. His legal team has lodged his application at the Bloemfontein Supreme Court.” EFF spokesman Ngawethu Madaka said: “We have been campaigning and never stopped, because we believed the by-elections would take place. But we respect the processes of the law and are going to win that ward.” DA councillor Mbulelo Jinikwe said: “We never stopped campaigning. We believe the ANC is not ready for the by-election. “The party is divided in that ward and we are going to win it.” Independent candidate the Reverend Xolani Tengo had a different view: “I have suspended my campaign because I have spent more than R45 000. I believed the by-election will be staged early next year, depending on the court outcome.” IEC boss Crosby Bacela said: “There are no by-elections because they were postponed by the municipality. “We have not received a new declaration,” Bacela said.
