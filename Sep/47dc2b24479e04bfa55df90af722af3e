THE official cause of a fire that claimed the lives of five family members has not yet been established. But neighbours said they suspect an electric stove used for warmth led to the deadly flames. Dad Zamo Hadebe (43) and mum Zandile Mdunge (42), with their children Ntombi (9), Philasande (5) and Mnqobi Mdunge (3) all died when fire consumed their shack on Saturday night in Imbali, outside Pietermaritzburg, in the KZN Midlands. A close neighbour and friend, Winile Shange (45) said she wasn’t at home when the incident happened, but neighbours called her. “I had gone to a nearby kasi for a family gathering. “It was the early hours of Sunday when other neighbours called me and told me about the incident. “When I got here, I couldn’t believe what I saw,” said Winile. She said judging from what they learned from a child who was friends with the family, they suspect that the fire was caused by a burning stove. “The kid told us that when she left for her home late on Saturday, they had been using the stove for warmth in the sleeping area. “We suspect they might have forgotten to switch it off and a blanket fell on it while they were sleeping, causing the blaze,” said Winile. She said the family had an illegal connection at their house since 2009, but that it had never given them any problems. She added that they were still trying to find the families of the dead as they came from somewhere else and were not originally from Pietermaritzburg. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said an inquest case was opened at Plessisslaer cop shop. “The cause of fire is unknown at this stage,” he said.
