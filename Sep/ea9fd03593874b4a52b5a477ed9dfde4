THE seven kids had been happily playing in their
playhouse (mantloane), when they decided they would light a fire inside and
pretend to be cooking dinner. Within minutes their mantloane, made of plastic, old
cupboards and thatch, was a roaring inferno. According to Lesotho Times, only one child survived – the
youngest, a one-year-old – but who suffered terrible injuries. This tragedy unfolded last Saturday at Ha-Makoae in
Qacha’s Nek, southern Lesotho. The other kids reportedly suffered terrible burns and
were suffocated to death by the smoke. The Matoetoe family lost three of their kids, the Takanas
two children, the Mohales one child, while the survivor is from the Pheko
family. Of the six who died, all except one were girls. The
children were between six and eight years old. Heartbroken relative, Manamolela Matoetoe said: “The
structure was about 300 metres away from the family compound and it was too
late when the adults realised that the children were in danger. “They rushed to
the burning house but when they got there nothing could be done to rescue the children.
It was a windy day so the whole structure caught fire very quickly. “We have heard horrific tales from those who were present
who narrated how the bodies lay motionless in the burning debris.” The kids were rushed to hospital. One was declared dead on
arrival. Four others died on the way to another hospital, while the last died
the following day. The one-year-old survivor is reportedly recovering well
in hospital. “Their parents are devastated. The households of the
children are so sombre. The families have agreed on a joint funeral service,” Manamolela
said. The funeral was due to take place today.
