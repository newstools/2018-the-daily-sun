RESIDENTS of Qandu Village in Port St Johns are not happy with their chief. They claimed she was greedy and accused her of stealing from them to support a fancy lifestyle. They’ve demanded that Chief Noluntu Ndamase be removed. “Our community can no longer be ruled by a greedy and corrupt person,” said a villager. “She demands unnecessary payments from the poor to enrich herself while unemployment is high in the area. “She has been using cops, her puppets, to arrest anyone who speaks out against corruption.” Villagers said they’d had problems with the chief since last year. Chief Noluntu has been in power since the death of her husband Duma in 2016. “It’s common to be fined R1000 for a petty case. People are paying for the same land,” said the villager. Another villager said: “The chief steals from the poor. Iingcibi are forced to pay about R400 for their services. “We doubt her legitimacy as a chief because her lobola was paid after the death of her husband. “She must step down with immediate effect. Enough is enough!” Noluntu told the People’s Paper: “The matter is before the royal family. “At this stage, I can’t comment further on whether I should step down.” The matter was reported to Western Pondoland King Ndamase Ndamase on Thursday last week. The king’s spokesman Chief Jongusapho Boklein said: “We found that the procedure for laying a grievance was not properly followed. “We tasked the royal family with resolving the matter.”
