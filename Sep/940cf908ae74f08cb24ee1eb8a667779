NCAMISILE Ndwandwe (44) from Umlazi F section , south of Durban, lost her ID when her shack was reduced to ashes earlier this year. However, she was unable to replace it because she did not have the R140 required to apply for a new one. She told Daily Sun she was unemployed and survived on her two children’s social grants. Ncamisile said she could barely afford to buy groceries because the grant money was used to support eight unemployed family members. “I don’t know what to do because when I tell people I don’t have R140, they laugh at me and think I’m joking. It’s difficult to convince people to give me a loan because they ask how I will pay them back if I don’t have a job.” Ncamisile said since her home was torched, she and her family were living in a one-roomed shack. Contracters refused to hire her as a refuse collector because she doesn’t have an ID. She appealed to SunReaders to help her find a job. Provincial Home Affairs manager Cyril Mncwabe said there was nothing he could do because it was government policy to charge people reapplying for an ID.
