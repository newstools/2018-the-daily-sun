Former president Jacob Zuma’s legal fees now stand at a staggering R17 million. This is according to the Democratic Alliance’s Federal Council chairman James Selfe. Selfe said that a letter sent by President Cyril Ramaphosa to Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete revealed that Zuma’s total legal fees stands at R16,788,781.14. It was previously believed to be R15,3 million. The additional R1,4 million was allegedly discovered after the Department of Justice launched an investigation into the allegations. “The DA has launched an application to review and set aside the agreements between the Presidency and Jacob Zuma to cover the legal costs incurred by him for his criminal prosecution,” Selfe said. “The case will be heard in the High Court in Pretoria on 6 and 7 November 2018.” Selfe also said that Zuma should not be entitled to financial support from the government. “Over the last decade, Zuma has exploited our justice system with numerous court proceedings that had the intention of avoiding or delaying criminal prosecutions against him. He has also misused the courts to maintain his grip on power,” he said. “The taxpayer has so far footed the bulk of the legal bill for this. “ The DA will not stand by and let this unjust situation continue. South Africans have already paid too dearly for Zuma’s term in office and should not be required to foot the costs of his legal proceedings.”
