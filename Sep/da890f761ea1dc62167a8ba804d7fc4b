RELIGIOUS leaders marched in silence to parliament in Cape Town yesterday. They demanded to be heard by President Cyril Ramaphosa, calling on him to host an imbizo on the country’s high crime rate. According to their memorandum, they demanded that government host a summit with all relevant partners – including religious leaders, the private and public sectors, NGOs, community leaders and business – to find a way to deal with crime. “We support proactive government, which engages the people in search of solutions and resolutions. Please engage with us, the faith leaders, and allow us to speak for the people we represent,” said Berry Behr from the Cape Town Interfaith Initiative. The religious leaders also prayed for Mzansi’s people to be spared from crime and for the police to be able to do their work without being murdered by thugs. They prayed that government would “do right” and work with the religious leaders to fight South Africa’s rampant crime. The Presidency’s regional manager, Charles Ford, accepted the memorandum and assured the marchers that Ramaphosa would “definitely” respond to it. Ford said it could take between four and six weeks for the president to respond.
