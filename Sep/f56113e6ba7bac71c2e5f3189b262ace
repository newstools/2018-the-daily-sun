THE dead should be left to rest in peace – but heartless thugs have not allowed this for gogo Boniwe Mtyobile. Now the gogo’s family are hoping that she turns in her grave and makes the people who vandalised her final resting place pay for doing so. The gogo died in 2008 and was buried at Matanzima Cemetery in KwaNobuhle, Nelson Mandela Bay. The following year, her children put a fence with an iron gate around her grave and installed an expensive tombstone after saving up money for it. When the fence and gate were stolen in 2013, the family assumed it was the work of evil criminals who wanted to sell the metal as scrap. But the family were shocked to learn last month that thugs used a grinder to cut off a huge piece of the tombstone. The gogo’s daughter, Noni Mtyobile (58) said she had been having sleepless nights since she saw the condition her mum’s grave was left in. “I bought the tombstone in 2009 for R16 000. Back then I had a job and could afford it, but now I am unemployed and penniless,” she said. “Where will I get the money to buy another tombstone?” Noni said she suspected the damage was done by people who were in the business of selling tombstones. “These are people in the funeral business,” she said. “They have clients for the tombstone already. “I hope my mother turns in grave and makes them pay for their sins.” Luyolo Nqakula of Uitenhage Funeral Home said: “I would urge the affected family to request footage from the municipality, because there are cameras at the graveyard.” Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said the family should lay a complaint with the manager of the cemetery so that the municipality could investigate.
