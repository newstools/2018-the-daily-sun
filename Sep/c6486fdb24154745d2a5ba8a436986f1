Scores of pupils in Ngcobo, near Mthatha have been given a lifeline. The Services Seta made a commitment to work with the AmaQwathi Traditional Council to better the children’s future through career expos and donations. Amanda Buzo-Gqoboka, CEO of Service Seta, an agency working under the department of education, spoke to pupils at a career expo in Nkondlo Village on Friday. She said they wanted the community to have a relationship with the King Sabata Dalindyebo TVET College so pupils in the area could study there. She said they would donate R10 million towards a skills centre and cultural village. “We need to uplift the villages we come from. We will commit to learning interventions suitable for this area. “Going further, we will also look at a mini skills centre focusing on artisan related skills and see how best we can assist AmaQwathi through the college. “Teachers must expose pupils to the various career paths they can follow.” AmaQwathi chief Dabulingwe Ndzima said they were happy with the intervention by the agency. “We have a high rate of school drop-outs in this area and that leads to crime and pregnancies. When they drop out of schools they have no skills and so we approached the agency to assist us,” he said. Bulelani Nyholo, a grade 12 pupil at Nyanga High school, said: “This will help those pupils who don’t know what they want to do after passing matric.” Chris Mthomane from the district office of education said the partnership will also alleviate the problem of taking wrong subjects. Fikile Xasa , the corporate governance and traditional affairs MEC,said the partnership would decrease the tragedy of youth unemployment.
