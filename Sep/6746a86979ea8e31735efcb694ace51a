SECURITY guards watched in horror as a man drowned in the dam near the Loch Logan Waterfront Mall in Bloemfontein on Thursday. His body was discovered by police divers that same day. It’s the second time that someone has died in the dam. A Central University of Technology student jumped off a building and drowned last month. One of the guards said: “I thought I was dreaming. I saw a man from a distance swimming in the dam. “As I got closer, I realised it was reality. “I tried shouting at the man to get out of the water, but he laughed at me and continued. “I called my colleagues over the radio to come and assist, but there was nothing we could do to get the man out of the water. “He seemed drunk, and in just minutes he disappeared under the water and didn’t come back up.” Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane said an inquest docket was opened. “This comes after a man’s body was found in the dam,” said Covane. “A security guard called the police after he vanished under water.”
