Wine is usually consumed at social gatherings and gained it's popular name 'Drink of the Gods" because it dates back to 6000 BC and 5000 BC with it's origins in Georgia and Iran. Street Dictionary says that archaeological digs have provided evidence that clearly shows the domestication of the grapevine around the Near East, Sumer and Egypt during the third millennium BC. As long ago as 6 500 years wine was being made in Greece. Wine is also an aphrodisiac of love but only when consumed to moderation. A bizarre finding was published with a study that showed a link between drinking wine –specifically red wine– and an increased sexual appetite in women. This research focused on 800 women who drank red wine, other alcohol, or no alcohol at all. The red wine drinkers scored two points higher than other alcohol drinkers in an increased desire to poke, and four more points than teetotalers. Overall, the study isn’t enough to support wine and sex drive, but it did inspire more research. Wine in small amounts does increase your libido. It also make you hungry and feel flushed and this is because ethanol stimulates a primitive part of your brain called the hypothalamus, which is located right above your brain stem. Wine also contains aromas that naturally arouse women which are musky, earthy, woody, licorice-y, and cherry-like aromas. When it comes to alcohol and sex, the best prescription is to split a bottle of red with your partner because remember: moderation is key.
