EVERY child deserves to play with a toy that represents them. This is according to the co-founder of Sibahle Collection, Khulile Vilakazi-Ofosu from Randburg, northern Joburg. Sibahle Collection is making waves with their different take on dolls. September is Albinism Awareness Month and young children living with this condition can also get a doll which represents them. Khulile told Daily Sun they have a doll named Zuri, a Swahili word for beauty. This doll represents young girls with Albinism. “It will help kids grow up confident,” said Khulile. She said their dolls seek to make children of all races feel represented. Khulile said the idea was inspired by her daughter, who has an Afro. She and her partner Caroline Hlahla got to work and started producing Afro-centric dolls. Dolls they have so far are Zuri, Nobuhle, Bontle, Ayana and the Indian Neha. Khulile said she has never seen an Indian doll before, which is why they have Neha.
