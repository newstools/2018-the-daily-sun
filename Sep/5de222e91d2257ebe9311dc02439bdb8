Gazankulu Liberation Congress intends to sue Black
Leopards boss David Thidiela on grounds of hate speech and incitement of public
violence. Thembani Chavane said GLC has opened a case of hate
speech and incitement of violence against Thidiela. This follows a post Soccer match personal confrontation
of the Referee Victor Hlungwani who was officiating a PSL Match hosted at
Thohoyandou Stadium by Black Leopards Fc. "Words expressed by Mr David Thidiela amounts to
serious hatred of the Official and his ethnic group of Vatsonga Machangana
people living South Africa in general," said Chavane. He said the South African constitution Act no 108 of 1996
Chapter 1 & 2 strives to promote unity among st racial, ethnicity and sexuality
holistically. GLC on behalf of all South Africans wish to announce its
words of disappointment and gross dissatisfaction on how Club owners who are
expected to respect the rules of the PSL and its other affiliated structures. Chavane said GLC has approached a human rights lawyer for
advice and has also visited Thohoyandou Police station to report the matter. He went on to say South African laws do not support any
form of incitement of hate speech and expressions that promotes tribal
supremacy over one another. "We urge the Premier Soccer League to take a legal
and disciplinary actions action against the perpetrators of this acts such as
what was expressed by the Executive Chairman of Black Leopards FC Mr David
Thidiela on Sunday 16 September 2018 at Thohoyandou Stadium in full view of the
public," said Chavane. He also said PSL and Sport in general should be used to
unite our people from all walks of life. “We draw inspiration from the journalists who recorded
the event in order to disseminate a message of wrong doing within our sporting
codes.”
