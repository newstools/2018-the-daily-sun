THE Ngubenis are struggling to cope with the death of four of their children. Amukelani (2)‚ Sandile (4) and Nhlanhla Ngubeni (7), and their cousin Mbali Fihlani (5) died after their house caught fire in Alexandra, northern Joburg, last Sunday. They had been left in the care of their 14-year-old brother, who managed to escape and called for help. Their mothers, Bongiwe Ngubeni (31) and Nelisiwe Fihlani (28) were reportedly out drinking at a tavern when the fire broke out. The two mums are currently behind bars facing charges of culpable homicide, child abuse and child neglect. They appeared in the Alexandra Magistrates Court last Tuesday and their bail application was postponed to Friday. The children were laid to rest at Waterfall Cemetery on Thursday. The children’s uncle, Mzwandile Ngubeni, said the mums were devastated that they couldn’t bury their children. “We haven’t found closure. There are many unanswered questions,”said Mzwandile. “The mothers’ hearts were very sore when they were taken back into custody because they wanted to bury their children. “Sadly, we had to proceed with the burial because our culture doesn’t allow us to keep bodies that are in a bad state for long before burial.” He said Bongiwe had two surviving children and Nelisiwe had one.
