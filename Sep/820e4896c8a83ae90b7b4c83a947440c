An intoxicated man who was arrested for interfering with police duties caused havoc while being charged at a cop shop. The incident happened in Polokwane, Limpopo. Cops spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a police unit entrusted with the responsibility of preventing crime in the city centre were busy with crime prevention duties, arresting suspects for being in possession of dagga and nyaope in the city centre. He said the cops were suddenly attacked by a group of suspects traveling in two vehicles. "An assortment of objects including stones, were thrown at the cops. Two officers suffered slight injuries and two police vehicles were also damaged," said Ngoepe. The situation became volatile and, in the process, the group allegedly started shooting at the cops who fired back, injuring one of the suspects in the leg. Ngoepe said three suspects, including the one who was shot, were arrested and taken to the police station. He said while at the police station, one of the arrested suspects was so intoxicated that he started damaging police equipment such as computers, photocopiers, and also broke windows. He was subsequently subdued. More arrests are expected.
