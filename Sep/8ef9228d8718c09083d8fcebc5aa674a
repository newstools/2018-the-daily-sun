THOUSANDS of gatvol women in South Korea are swamping the
streets of the capital Seoul in protest at the epidemic of cameras being put into
places like loos to secretly film them. Carrying posters that read “My Life Isn’t Your Porn” and
dressed in red, street protests were begun in May and have become a monthly
event, with as many as 70 000 marching to express their fury. According to The
Telegraph, the number of spycam crimes reported to cops has gone up from about
1 100 in 2010 to 6 500 last year. Between 2012 and 2016 there have been 26 000
victims – and those are just the reported ones. The “spy-cam” pervs hide spy cams in schools, offices,
trains, toilets and changing rooms. Offenders have included school teachers,
professors, doctors, church pastors, government officials, police officers and
even a court judge, said The Telegraph. Men are responsible for more than 90% of the offences,
reports The Guardian. A 21-year-old student told AFP: "You never know if
there's a spycam lens hidden inside... filming you while you pee." She has
resorted to stabbing a sharp object into holes in the loo cubicle to destroy
any potential lenses or stuffing tissue inside to block them. A protestor called Ellin told AFP: "The pent-up
anger among women has finally reached a boiling point.” In an effort to end the madness, Seoul government
officials are now expected to inspect public toilets for hidden cameras on a
daily basis, reports The Guardian.
