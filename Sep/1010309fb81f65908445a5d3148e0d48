THESE people were brought together by hopes of a better life. The group of more than 90 people invested money in a fund that promised huge returns through Bitcoin and Forex investments. But their dreams went up in smoke when it emerged they had been defrauded of R10 million! The victims invested amounts of between R10 000 and R330 000 in a Gauteng-based financial scheme between March last year and July. They said they were convinced everything was above board as the scheme had swanky offices in Joburg and Ekurhuleni. The scheme changed names often and was at various times called FX Legacy, Lunatu, Step to Step and Criptopimo, but this didn’t raise alarm bells. The alleged scammer changed offices every few months. Victim Bongo Ngqukwana (62) said he lost his life savings of R110 000. He was the one who first realised the scheme was a scam and contacted Daily Sun. Leanne Mabena said she convinced many people to invest in the scheme, including her husband. All seven of the alleged fraudster’s numbers went straight to voicemail and she didn’t return any calls. Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed a case of fraud was opened. “No one has been arrested yet as investigations are still continuing,” he said.
