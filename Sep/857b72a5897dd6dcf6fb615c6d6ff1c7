BUS passengers in Hong Kong have been warned to check
their seats carefully before sitting down because some evil person has been
planting sharp needles in them. According to Coconuts, cops thought the bum-pricking
problem was behind them after a man was arrested in July for planting needles
in the seats of public buses. Mok Cham-sum (30) planted 12 needles in seats in
different buses, injuring four people. Cham-sum was apparently angry with the bus company for
missing his stops. But this week it seems the scourge is back. The Headline
Daily reported that on Monday a 63-year-old man named only as Chu suffered a
terrible shock when he sat on a three centimetre sewing needle on the 7.45am
bus. He was on his way home after working through the night as
a security guard and said he was too tired to bother checking his seat. Chu was rushed to United Christian Hospital for
treatment. Needles have reportedly been found sticking out of seats
in several other buses this week.
