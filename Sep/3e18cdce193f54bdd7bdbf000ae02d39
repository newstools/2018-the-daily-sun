MADALA Zamile Peyi entered Daily Sun competitions for five long years without any luck, but he never gave up. And last week the 63-year-old from KwaNobuhle in Nelson Mandela Bay won the weekly grocery competition! The madala said when he was first told he had won a R2 500 voucher, he thought it was a scam. He was over the moon when he realised it was real. “Thank you, Daily Sun. You came to my rescue just as I was worrying about how I was going to buy groceries this month. “I used my grant money to fix my car, which I use to transport kids to school,” he said. “Since 2013, I’ve never missed an edition of my favourite paper. “Every time I go to school to drop off the kids, I rush to get my paper. “It keeps me busy while I wait for them to knock off.” Madala said he had never won a competition. “I kept entering competitions in Daily Sun for five years and saw other people winning. “I told myself I’d keep trying, hoping one day I’d also win. “I urge other SunReaders not to give up. “They must keep on entering the competition and their time will come.”
