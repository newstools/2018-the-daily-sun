MANY kasi children grow up without fathers. Siphenathi Mayekiso (27) is one of them. He did not live with his dad because he worked far away from home. “My dad was not a presence in my life. We didn’t stay connected and I never felt a father’s love,” said Siphenathi. “Young men, including my dad, were recruited in their thousands to work in the mines in Joburg. He seldom came home. “When he finally came back, he was a different man. As a result, he failed to blend in with the community.” In order to fill the void, Siphenathi said, he took part in dance. He later invented a dance called inkanuko (desire). He runs through his dance moves using a wheelbarrow! “The wheelbarrow represents mineworkers and other parents who leave their families behind to work in faraway places,” he said. “When these workers come back home, they demand recognition and fail to win the hearts and minds of other people. ” Siphenathi said his dance moves attract many spectators and he explains to them the logic behind the dance. “I hope to encourage the current generation to spend more time with their families,” he said. “Father absence usually has a negative impact on children and adolescents. “These kids face an increased risk of developing behavioural problems. “We’re a generation of men raised by women. “Without male role models, many men of this generation have felt adrift. Siphenathi, who is living with albinism himself, said: “This is another struggle. “I always raise awareness about albinism and its challenges. “Albinos must be respected and treated fairly.”
