THESE residents have welcomed spring with smiles on their faces. The people of Palm Ridge extension 10, Ekurhuleni, were on Friday told some of them would be given pieces of land to build their own houses. Speaking to residents at the launch of the rapid land release programme, Premier David Makhura assured residents those who got land won’t have to wait long for the title deeds. Makhura was accompanied by Human Settlements MEC Dikgang Moiloa, Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina, MMC for human settlements Lesiba Mpya and other councillors. They would give 2000 stands to people who’re able to build houses. “We don’t want to give you stands only for you to build shacks. We want you to build proper houses.” Makhura said they had started the process of checking who qualified for stands and the building process would be monitored. The government would allocate 4000 RDPs. “What we’re trying to do is decrease the waiting period for people to get houses,” he said. “There are people who can build their own houses but can’t afford to purchase land.” The premier said those who couldn’t afford to build their own houses would be given RDPs. Masina said they were giving land to people because they didn’t want to see illegal land grabs happening like in other areas.
