IT SEEMS legendary actress Lillian Dube is not the only gogo who uses sex toys. Gogo Sarah Mthembu said she’s furious with cops because they silenced her vibrator. The 65-year-old wants Ekurhuleni Metro cops to reconnect the izinyoka wires they removed from Madelakufa in Tembisa last Wednesday. The cops and municipal officials pounced on the squatter camp in the early hours of the morning while residents were still sleeping. When they woke up, they found their power had been cut off and there were only furrows in the ground where the izinyoka wires used to run. Gogo Sarah said she usually plugged in her vibrator every morning but last Wednesday, she was shocked to find there was no electricity. “I rely on electricity because batteries cost too much.” Gogo Sarah told Daily Sun she had been using a vibrator since her husband died 10 years ago. “I love my vibrator more than anything,” she said. Other residents were so angry they took to the streets to burn tyres and clashed with the cops. Some accused the cops of assaulting them. Philemon Ngcobo (43) said he was in his mkhukhu when three cops came in, grabbed him and assaulted him. “They kicked me in my private parts and punched me,” said Philemon. “They didn’t find a single cable in my shack but I was moered for what other people did.” Ekurhuleni Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said six people were arrested and will appear in court soon.
