THE family of murdered teacher Gadimang Mokolobate from Miga Village near Mahikeng is grief-striken. They told Daily Sun at his funeral in Dinokana in Zeerust, North West, on Saturday they were not ready to forgive. Maths teacher Gadimang (24) was stabbed to death with a butcher knife on 13 September, allegedly by a 17-year-old pupil. The pupil apparently held a grudge after the teacher wouldn’t let him skip the queue. Gadimang’s uncle Kenosi Sebigi blamed education authorities for his nephew’s death. Holding back tears, he said: “We gave you our brave and strong son alive and walking, but you brought him back dead. “You killed our child! That boy was a pillar of strength in the family.” Kenosi urged the family not to seek revenge and accused government and the ANC of changing laws and making it easy to commit crime. The funeral was attended by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, Premier Job Mokgoro, Education MEC Sello Lehari, North West University vice-chancellor Dan Kgwadi, Sadtu leaders and other government leaders. Lehari said the department had failed to protect teachers. Mokgoro said he was looking forward to taking part in the School Safety Summit, to be called by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. Gadimang was active in soccer and in the ANC Youth League, and he sat on various committees. The pupil is being kept at a place of safety.
