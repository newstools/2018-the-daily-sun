Controversial queen of the red-carpet, Skolopad has returned to work following a meltdown that led to a drug overdose last month. The nurse who moonlights as a singer told TshisaLive that she is indeed back at work but working a different department now. “I am working in a new department now. My psychologist diagnosed me with severe depression and this new environment is really helping. I have no colleagues. I am happy with how everything has turned out so far. I am still under the same boss but it is okay because at least I am back at work,” she said. SKOLOPAD ALLEGEDLY IN HOSPITAL AFTER OVERDOSE Skolopad landed in hospital at the beginning of August after a “heated” argument sent her over the edge and she overdosed on anti-anxiety medication. Fans were extremely concerned about the star’s health after the incident. This was made even worse by her posting of cryptic messages including Bible verses about “healing” through prayer. CONCERN OVER SKOLOPAD’S HEALTH INTENSIFIES! But they will be relieved to know that she is back on her feet now.
