Members of the Ntenga Foundation and uShaka Marine World handed over 270 pairs of brand new school shoes. After the handover, the pupils were entertained by uShaka mascots Delia the Dolphin, Slippy the Seal, Rusty the Penguin and Raggy the Shark. Deputy principal Dumisani Mvubu said the shoes had already beengiven to pupils in need and the kids, teachers and principal were very grateful. “A lot of the children have benefited and we are very appreciative,” he said. Stella Khumalo, the CEO of uShaka, said the funds for the shoes were raised at at Ntenga Foundation charity run held at uShaka earlier this year. “Now in its fourth year, the run is already one of the top charity mass participation events in KZN, bringing together a fusion of music and athletics,” she said. Khumalo said nearly 500 social runners, families and friends participated in the race. “Funds raised through these events go towards making school shoes for underprivileged children like those at Amaoti Primary School.” Khumalo said they worked with people who helped identify schools that needed assistance. “At this particular school they needed shoes, so the Ntenga Foundation donated shoes and we came up with entertainment for the pupils.” “They appreciated it and enjoyed themselves very much on the day,”she said.
