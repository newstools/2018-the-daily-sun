ALL gogo wanted to do was connect electricity to her house. But she can’t as the property is not in her name. Gogo Pontsho Mofokeng (109) from Katlehong in Ekurhuleni has never had electricity on her property. She runs a creche in her house. She said she was deceived by a woman she hired as a secretary. She claimed the secretary registered the property in her name. “I’ve always had a love of kids, so I opened a creche in my old place not far from here. However, it was small, so I asked for a much bigger space and was given this house,” said the gogo. She told Daily Sun she worked with the secretary to grow the facility until the secretary disappeared in the late 1990s. Gogo found out later the property was in the secretary’s name. “She left and I have not seen her since. This property is mine and I have lived here since 1988,” she said. Now all gogo Pontsho wants is to leave this world knowing her property has lights. She applied for an electricity connection at Eskom in 2014 and paid R11 093,60. However, she still uses candles and paraffin stoves. But Eskom showed Daily Sun documents that showed the amount that gogo paid was refunded. “We could not connect her electricity because the property is not in her name. Eskom requires proof of ownership, a certificate of compliance and copy of ID to be able to connect electricity to the premises. “We can reload and re-quote the customer once we receive the correct documents,” said Eskom.
