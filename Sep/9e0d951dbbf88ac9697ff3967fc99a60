THEY are trained to educate tomorrow’s leaders. But they are under attack and living in fear! Mzansi’s teachers say the profession has become one of the most dangerous career choices as they risk life and limb every day as they enter classrooms with pupils armed to the teeth. Scores of videos and photos have emerged on social media of pupils fighting with teachers and sometimes among themselves. In a recent shocking incident, a 15-year-old Eldorado Park Secondary School pupil pointed a firearm at a teacher. In Zeerust, Gadimang Mokolobate was allegedly stabbed to death by a 17-year-old pupil at the school on Wednesday. He had reprimanded the pupil for jumping the queue at the school’s feeding programme. Teachers at a Vaal school told Daily Sun that some pupils even lit cigarettes in class while the teacher was trying to teach. “Times are tough. These unruly kids pee on chairs and other pupils’ bags. “They are more interested in how we dress, apply make-up and how much our hair costs,” said the teacher. The teachers added that other pupils ran businesses at school. “No one can tell them to stop selling cigarettes. They also stab each other to pledge allegiance to their gangs,” added one. Some teachers took to social media to express their outrage.) Jerry Matsaneng: It’s time teachers took a stand. Individual voices won’t be heard, but the group will be heard. Put classes on hold and call all parents to attend a meeting with educators to inform them of their kids’ behaviour. Unity is your only solution. Tools down to give the classroom back to the teacher.) Reabetswe Khotle: Police should patrol all schools. The kids are dangerous. Meanwhile, the department of basic education said that 151 pupils were expelled for bad behaviour last year.
