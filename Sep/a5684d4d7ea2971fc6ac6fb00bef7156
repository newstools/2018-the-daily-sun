THE African National Congress (ANC) Chairperson in Kwandengezi Thulani Nxumalo was killed in Monday night. He was gunned down while arriving home after the Branch Executive Committee meeting. “Although the information regarding his murder remain sketchy, it appears that Nxumalo’s attackers hid themselves around his home and shot him several time on his arrival,” Mhlabuzima Memela said. Memela said the ANC call on the law enforcement agencies to investigate the wanton killing of this ANC leader. “He was known for the love of his community and always stood up against criminal elements that compromises human rights. Nxumalo as a CPF member was hard at work to ensure Ward 12 was never turned into a nest of criminal activity.” “We are shocked and outraged by a mysterious murder of Cde Nxumalo and we find his murder a vicious attack on the all the peace loving people. We are severely pained by the continuous killing of community leaders in the province. We dip our banner in honour of this fallen cadre of our revolution and commit ourselves to pick up his spear and soldier on with the struggle for the betterment of our people lives which he waged until his last moments,” ANC Provincial Secretary, Mdumiseni Ntuli said. “The ANC extend its heartfelt condolences to Cde Nxumalo family, comrades and friends.”
