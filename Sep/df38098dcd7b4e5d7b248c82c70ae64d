It hasn’t been 24
hours since the decriminalization of dagga in Mzansi was announced. A video that has
surfaced has shown that some cops also support the decriminalization! The video was posted
earlier on Tuesday in Richards’ Bay, Kwa-Zulu Natal, after the Constitutional
Court ruled that private use of dagga is now legal. In the video, a cop is
shown receiving a handful of zol from a resident. He then smiles
gleefully and nods happily has he wraps the zol in some paper before driving
away! In the video, the cop
is told that it is now legal to grow and smoke weed in your home. The cop is evidently
pleased with this, as he smiles while the citizen speaks to him.
