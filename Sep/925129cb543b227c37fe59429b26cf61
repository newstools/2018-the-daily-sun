THREE police officers have been arrested for alleged corruption, kidnapping and armed robbery. Sergeant Humbulani Mulaudzi (39), Constable Hlengani Maswanganyi (33) and Constable Wimpy Makwela (37) will have to spend another weekend behind bars until their bail application gets underway on Monday. The cops, stationed at Bela-Bela cop shop, were arrested on Friday at the station in front of their colleagues. The fourth suspect, another cop, is still at large. Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said: “The four officers allegedly robbed a complainant of about R190 000 at gunpoint on 7 September. “This was after they escorted him from a local gambling facility and demanded that he pay them a bribe not to pursue money laundering charges against him,” said Maluleke. He said the officers were traced after the incident was reported to the Hawks’ serious corruption investigation unit. The trio appeared in the Bela-Bela Magistrates Court on Tuesday. “The fourth suspect has not reported for duty since the arrest of his colleagues,” said Maluleke. “It’s still not clear if he’s on leave or not, but we are searching for him.” The four officers allegedly initially demanded a R50 000 bribe. The complainant apparently said he was willing to pay R20 000. They took him to an abandoned house at gunpoint, which is where the alleged transaction took place. Matimba added: “The matter was then reported to the Hawks’ serious corruption investigation unit. “We subsequently traced and arrested the officers. The fourth suspect was not at the station that particular day. “They will appear in court again on Monday for a formal bail application.”
