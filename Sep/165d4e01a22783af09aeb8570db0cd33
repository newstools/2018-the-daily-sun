FOR some time, the residents have spoken out against thugs who drag their victims into the old building in Wattville, Ekurhuleni. They call the building “emakamereni” because it has many bedrooms and they believe it is a place where thugs rob, rape and even kill their victims. But on Wednesday morning residents had enough after a woman was attacked. Armed with hammers, picks and axes, they went to rescue the woman and demolished the structure. “We heard her screaming and we got up,” said a resident. A taxi driver tried to chase the thugs but they disappeared among the houses. The woman who had already been stabbed was rushed to hospital but later discharged. “I thank God for saving my life. I could be dead by now,” she said. She said the two men grabbed her as she was waiting for the taxi to get to work. Another resident, Boy Mayisela, was also stabbed and he’s still in hospital. Mduduzi Hlatswayo (27) was not so lucky. He was stabbed to death last Friday and his body was found lying in the building. Mduduzi’s sister Lindiwe said her brother left the house after he said he was coming back, but he never did. “We’re trying to cope with his death, but it’s difficult.” Captain Pheello Mothapo of Actonville cop shop said murder and assault cases were opened. He said cops were looking for the suspects.
