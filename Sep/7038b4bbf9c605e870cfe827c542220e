Shop owners in Giyani had expired food removed from their
shelves. The Mopani District Municipality's Environmental Health
Practitioners, SARS officials, SAPS and other sector departments who were led
by the District's Executive Mayor Nkakareng Rakgoale had a successful operation
aimed at removing expired foodstuff and other illegal items from shelves in a
number of shops in Giyani. District Municipality Spokesperson Witness Tiva said it
was found that some shops are allegedly selling expired food to the communities. He said the confiscated stuff will be disposed at an
undisclosed location within the district. "The operation follows a public outcry that was
sparked by a video of expired groceries making rounds on social media platforms,"
said Tiva. There is now a national directive that Environmental
Health Practitioners must embark on inspection blitzes within their respective
municipalities. Speaking to the media the District's Executive Mayor Cllr
Rakgoale has indicated that it is important to note that the operation is
targeting all shops owned by both local and foreign nationals. She says this is a proactive measure that the district is
putting in place as the safety of the people is a priority.
