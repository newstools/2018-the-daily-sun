NTOMBENHLE Magwaza said an independent woman gains dignity and respect. She said her dream is to see women learning to be strong and self- reliant, rather than depending on men. The 56-year-old from Empangeni in northern KZN said she has managed to raise four children and build a six-roomed house without a fancy job or depending on a man. Ntombenhle survives by running a business selling drums and traditional attire in Sydney Road, Durban. She started the business after her dad’s death in 1999. She told Daily Sun: “When he died, I asked my mum to teach me the ins and outs . She taught me everything and I took over that year.” She said her four grown-up kids always praise her hard work. She said three of them are employed and can take care of themselves, while the 20-year-old is still in grade 12. “My husband died in 2007. “I hate seeing a woman being dependent. If we learn to do things ourselves, maybe that will help reduce women abuse.” She said because her drums are strong, she even gets customers from outside KZN. Ntombenhle uses cow skin to make her drums and hopes one day to open a big shop and create job opportunities for the youth. “I thank my 93-year-old mum that she taught me to be independent. She is an example to mothers not to spoil kids, especially girls. “We must teach them to survive in the world without losing their dignity or being dependent on others,” Ntombenhle said.
