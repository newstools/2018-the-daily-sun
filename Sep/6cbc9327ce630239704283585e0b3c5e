South Africa and Africa’s leading Video Entertainment and Internet Company, MultiChoice has announced that it will soon let go of Sony and Sony MAX. The announcement came this past week with no reason from MultiChoice as to why it had made the decision. The channels, which air on DStv channels 127 and 128 respectively, will no longer be available for viewing on the popular DStv platform as of November 2018. The contract between Sony Pictures Television Networks and MultiChoice will expire at the end of October and the contract has not been renewed. Sony has been with MultiChoice and DStv since 2007 and was added to appease DStv’s male audience. Fans of the channel can still catch the Sony channel on Cell C’s online entertainment streaming service, black.
