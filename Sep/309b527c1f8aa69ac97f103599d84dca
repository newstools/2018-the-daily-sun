THE DA in Thabo Mbeki squatter camp in Philippi welcomed more than 60 new members from the ANC on Monday. The former ANC members told the People’s Paper they decided to leave the party because they are sick and tired of being told about history. Babalwa Mpayipheli (36) said every time they complained about the ANC, they were told about the party’s history. “We have been living in this area for more than 20 years but we are still far behind compared to other areas that are run by the DA,” said Mpayipheli. Buzwe Kali, who also joined the DA said, they decided they would not protest but use their votes to change their situation. “We boycotted the 2014 elections because we were not happy about how the ANC neglected us. After that they came and made the same empty promises they made in the previous years,” said Buzwe. Western Cape DA leader and Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela welcomed the new members. “We know you didn’t wake up and decide to join the DA. We know you are doing it because you trust us,” he said.
