ANC, DA and EFF members on Tuesday spoke with one voice when they marched to oppose a suspected hijacking kingpin’s bail application. The marchers, who went to Nkomazi Magistrates Court in Tonga, described Jabulani Nkuna (41) as a heartless monster who killed and raped victims who refused to co-operate with him. Nkuna allegedly tried to escape from police custody during his first court appearance last Monday. His alleged victims said they still slept with one eye open. “He threw me, my husband and my child in the boot of a car and drove off until the vehicle crashed into a house. “We were saved by the accident,” said one woman. To this day, my house remains locked day and night. What scares us the most is that his people are still out there.” Another woman said was tied up before her car and money were stolen. “They stormed into the house, tied up the whole family and looted the house. “I’m just grateful he didn’t rape me, unlike the other victims.” Nkuna was arrested on Friday after being on the run for almost two years. He faces charges of house robbery and hijacking. He will remain in police custody until he makes another court appearance on 20 October. Magistrate Jacob Mamabolo postponed the case for further investigation.
