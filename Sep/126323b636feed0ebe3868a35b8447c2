Local acapella group, The Soil is back with new music and as usual, they are pulling at our heart strings. The trio, made up of Buhle Mda, Ntsika Ngxanga, Luphindo Ngxanga, released their new single Korobela this week. The heartwarming jam is a love song about a love that is strong its almost as if you’re under a spell. The word “korobela” is a South African word that is associated with an alleged muthi that makes the one you fancy fall in love with you. In the song, a woman puts a love potion into her loved one’s meal, hoping that he would have eyes for no other woman but her. NTSIKA'S SOLO MOVE WON'T SPLIT THE SOIL The group is moving full steam ahead despite Ntsika’s recent announcement that he would embarking on a solo project. They recently completely their East African tour which was allegedly a huge success. Now that the group has returned home, fans can catch them alongside Freshly Ground at The Lyric Theatre on Saturday, the 6th of October.
