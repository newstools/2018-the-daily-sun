ORLANDO Pirates coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic has warned his players not to get carried away by their recent resurgence. After he witnessed his team end their three-year hoodoo with an impressive 3-1 victory over SuperSport United in an Absa Premiership match at Orlando Stadium on Saturday, the Serbian mentor was cool as a cucumber. Vincent Pule, Thembinkosi Lorch and Ben Motshwari’s goals gifted Bucs their first three points against SuperSport in the league since 29 April 2015. Bongani Khumalo scored the consolation goal for the Tshwane giants. The Buccaneers have now won back-to-back league matches, having beaten Black Leopards 2-1 three weeks ago. The Soweto giants head into their next league game against Cape Town City at the same venue on Wednesday (7.30pm) high on confidence. Having produced a five-star performance against the MTN8 finalists, Pirates will hope to stretch their winning streak to three matches at the expense of SuperSport’s opponents in the Wafa Wafa final. City were thumped 4-1 in Cape Town by fellow Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday. Said Sredojevic about Man of the Match Xola Mlambo: “I would like to congratulate Mlambo for his top performance. I believe he is one of the top three midfielders in this country and he is the backbone of our team. He carries this team in every match.” But the former Uganda mentor made it clear that he did not underestimate Benni McCarthy’s charges. He said: “We expect a tough match – I don’t want to be carried away by wins against Leopards and SuperSport. “We don’t want to put pressure on the players and tell them that they must win the next match. We are not even thinking about going on a long winning streak. We are still a work in progress and hope to get better with each game. “But the game against City will be a tough one and we won’t underestimate them.” Micho added that they would go back to the drawing board to plan properly for the Citizens, insisting that his players are growing in confidence.
