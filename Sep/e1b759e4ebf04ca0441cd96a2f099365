A FIGHT between Petros Khuzwayo and his wife many years ago led to him leaving home. He left behind his then 20-day-old daughter in Mnambithi, KZN in 1982. Now the 70-year-old from Orange Farm, south of Joburg is looking for his daughter Dudu. He told Daily Sun he had left Dudu with his late wife’s sister Catherine Khuzwayo in Mnambithi. “My wife died in 1982 after complications while giving birth to our daughter. Tradition forced me to marry my wife’s sister, Catherine, because I had paid lobola. “Things were good for a week when suddenly Catherine told me she didn’t want me,” said Petros. He claimed things went from bad to worse and he and Catherine often fought. “I was forced to move to Joburg to avoid the constant fights at home,” he said. Petros has been living in Orange Farm for more than 30 years. He appealed to SunReaders to help him find Dudu. “I am old and often get sick. All I wish for is a chance to see my daughter again,” said madala Petros. “She is all that I’m left with in this world, but I failed her as a father. I left her behind and never looked back.”
