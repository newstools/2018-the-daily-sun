THE ANC in KZN has dissolved the Moses Mabhida task team following weeks of infighting. The problems led to the last minute cancellation of the conference to elect new leaders in the region, based in Pietermaritzburg, on Wednesday. The decision to dissolve the structure was made by the PEC on Monday. On Tuesday afternoon, provincial party spokeswoman Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said last week was the last window period for regions to hold a conference. “There was a standing decision by the NEC that all processes of electing leaders and holding conferences, whether regional or provincial, should have been done no later than the end of last month.” “That is why everything possible was done to ensure the Harry Gwala and Moses Mabhida regions held their conferences last week.” Simelane-Zulu said the province was faced with the problem of a leadership vacuum in one of the largest regions. She said provincial leaders would meet branch members from Moses Mabhida to discuss the way forward. Sandile Dlamini, a member of the task team and an Msunduzi municipal councillor, confirmed that the task team was dissolved on Monday. He said he was unhappy with the decision as they hadn’t been given enough time to perform their tasks. “The task team was set up in July and was supposed to start a process that would eventually lead to a conference and the election of new leaders. That can’t happen in the space of eight weeks.” Problems in the Moses Madhiba region are believed to have spilled into municipalities around Pietermaritzburg, with councillors boycotting meetings in some cases.
