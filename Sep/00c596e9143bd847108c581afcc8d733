TO MANY, Libya may be synonymous with civil war. But that is not all there is to the North African country –and that is what the Libya team will be looking to prove when they tackle Bafana Bafana in their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Durban on Saturday. Just this week, deadly violence again broke out between militia groups in Libya’s capital city of Tripoli. But the Mediterranean Knights had already landed safely in Mzansi on Sunday. They have been holed up in Milpark, Joburg, for training sessions but will move camp to Durban today to acclimatise to conditions at the coast. Not much is known of the Libyan team, except that 11 of their squad members play for Al Ahli Tripoli and only four are based overseas. British-born Ahmad Benali plays for Italian side Crotone while Ismael Tajouri plays in the USA. “We are doing our programme here and later in Durban,” said Knights coach Adel Amrouche. “For me it’s not about Bafana Bafana. A game is a game. You prepare the team to win. “We have our objective, which is to qualify, and I think we have a good, motivated squad.” Amrouche was appointed head coach in April with a clear mandate to guide Libya to the 2019 Afcon tournament in Cameroon. It was around the time Fifa also visited the country for the first since it had banned the North African nation from hosting matches. The 2011 ban followed political turmoil, which forced the national team to play their matches in neighbouring countries. The ban was then reimposed in 2013 due to unrest. Libyan clubs have had to use neutral venues to host their league fixtures, while the national team played their “home” World Cup and Afcon qualifiers in Mali, Egypt and Tunisia over the last five years. But despite the domestic challenges, the Knights managed to qualify for the 2012 Afcon and are hoping to repeat the feat. However, while the process to rebuild football in Libya has begun the latest unrest and violence will do little to convince Fifa to lift its ban.
