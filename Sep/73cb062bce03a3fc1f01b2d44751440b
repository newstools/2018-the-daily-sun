“DON’T sleep in your shops, don’t sell expired goods to the community, bank your money and pay your tax!” These were the words of Free State top cop Lieutenant-General Moeketsi Sempe when he spoke to Bloemfontein business people at a meeting held at Tsoseletso High School in Blomanda kasi on Monday. The event was attended by all the station commanders of Mangaung kasi cop shops. Most of the business people were Somalis and Bangladeshis, who complained about business robberies at their shops. Mangaung cluster commander Major-General Solly Lesia warned the shop owners to stop giving sweets, money and soft drinks to cops, telling them it would land them behind bars. “I advise you to put tracking devices in your cars to help us fight crime. We are also aware of attacks you experience from your fellow countrymen. We request that you come with information so they can be arrested,” he said. Lesia warned shop owners that they faced the risk of being attacked by the community if they sold expired goods. Sempe told them: “We have a problem with the crime of business robbery. Invest in your business and install CCTV cameras. “Make it difficult for someone to break into your business and be vigilant at all times.” Sempe urged them to get rid of expired goods from their shelves and not to sell liquor to minors. “We will have a WhatsApp group where you can report crime to us and the cops will respond quickly. “Anyone who sleeps in their shop or sells expired goods will be charged under the Foodstuff, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act.”
