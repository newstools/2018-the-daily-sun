FREE STATE Stars winger William Twala left Ea Lla Koto under a cloud yesterday, asking the management to terminate his contract with immediate effect. Ea Lla Koto coach Luc Eymael told SunSport that he was surprised when he heard Twala had left Bethlehem without as much as a word to him, not even a text. The former Kaizer Chiefs star played only one game for Ea Lla Koto this season. Said Eymael: “After the Chiefs game (2-0 defeat), Twala went to see the physiotherapist. I heard he then went to manager Rantsi (Mokoena) saying he had a problem with his shin that’s painful. Therefore he would like to come to an agreement to terminate his contract.” Added Eymael: “I heard he packed all his things. It’s difficult for me to have an opinion because I don’t know what happened. He hasn’t spoken to me. If he left the club due to injury it’s sad, as I had hoped he would add value in the team. ” Twala was released by Chiefs to join Stars following an unsuccessful six-month loan stint with Maritzburg United last season. Attempts to get clarity from Mokoena were unsuccessful at the time of going to print as his cellphone rang unanswered.
