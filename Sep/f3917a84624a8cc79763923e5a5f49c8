A HIGH school girl thought making a video in which she spoke of her love of 4-5s and encouraged others to lose their virginity would be harmless. But she might find herself in hot water with the education department. In the video, which has gone viral, the pupil at Sikhululekile Secondary School in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, uses explicit language to talk about her love of 4-5s. She even goes as far as describing how it feels when one is inside her. The girl also criticises virgins, claiming they’re wasting their time. “I’m talking here about sex, the best feeling ever. “Anyone who is still a virgin is wasting her time,” she says in the video. “When the 4-5 is inside you, you will grab your pillow, blankets and even the furniture. You will even scream.” Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said the girl’s behaviour was unacceptable and an investigation had been launched. “The department is deeply concerned and condemns all allegations of sexual misconduct at schools. Officials have already been sent to the school to investigate the video. “Counselling will be offered to all affected pupils,” Mabona said.
