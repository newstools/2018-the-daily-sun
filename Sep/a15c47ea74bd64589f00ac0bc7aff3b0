Cape Town City overcame Mamelodi Sundowns on penalties in the MTN8 semi-finals on Sunday, despite losing 1-0 in the second leg at the Lucas Moripe Stadium. After a tight start to the cup-tie, Masandawana took the lead on 25 minutes. Themba Zwane's driven effort was parried away by Peter Leeuwenburgh and Ali Meza was quickest to react. The Venezuelan's square pass across the face of goal picked out Tony Silva at the far post and the striker only had to tap the ball home from close range to register his first goal for the Brazilians. The visitors threatened just eight minutes later. Craig Martin picked up a clearance from Leeuwenburgh inside his own half and went on a brilliant solo run that resulted in the forward forcing Denis Onyango into a smart save down low to his left. City came out in the second half in search of an equaliser and they went within inches of Onyango's left post when Mathew Rusike set up a shooting opportunity for Teko Modise, who dragged his shot from outside the box just wide. A minute later the hosts created an opening when Meza's ball from the right picked out Anthony Laffor, who stole in at the near post but failed to hit the target. Silva had a chance to win the match for Sundowns in the 90th minute. Thapelo Morena released the striker down the right wing and he cut in and curled a left footed shot that Leeuwenburgh palmed away to safety. The clash went to penalties after a 1-1 scoreline on aggregate, and Leeuwenburgh's heroics earned Benni McCarthy's side a place in the MTN8 final. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
