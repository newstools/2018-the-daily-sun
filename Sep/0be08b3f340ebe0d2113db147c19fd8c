THE MultiChoice Diski Challenge is back! And there’s much for football fans to look forward to in the fifth edition of the MDC, the competition established with the aim of fast-tracking the progression of youngsters to first teams. Over the years the league has met all expectations, giving players such as Motjeka Madisha, Kobamelo Kodisang, Keletso Makgalwa, Nduduzo Sibiya, Siya Ngezana and Wiseman Meyiwa the much-needed exposure to get promoted to the first teams. This year’s campaign kicks off on Saturday with three fixtures lined up. The first festival of the season takes place in KwaZulu-Natal at Hammersdale on Sunday from 10am. Champions Golden Arrows will have a plan to defend the title they won twice in three seasons, while Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, who have had no success in the MDC, will give it another try this year. Chiefs did raise hopes that they would be capable of mounting a challenge this year when they clinched the inaugural Diski Shield Cup. A lot is expected of them this season. The winners of the MDC will once again be rewarded with an international tour to a destination yet to be announced, where they will play friendly matches and receive training from some of the best youth coaches in the world.
