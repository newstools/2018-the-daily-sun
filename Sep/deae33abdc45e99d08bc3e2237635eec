FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane will face the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Evidence leader Paul Pretorius yesterday told the commission that Duduzane, who had previously said he wouldn’t testify, had changed his mind. He is expected to testify over allegations made by former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas, who told the commission Duduzane had arranged a meeting where the Guptas offered him R600 million. The commission yesterday heard how the Gupta brothers pocketed money from the Government Communication and Information System when the institution was being run by Mzwanele Manyi. National Treasury official Jan Gilliland said in March 2012, GCIS paid The New Age R5,6 million. Manyi had taken over the position from Themba Maseko, who was allegedly removed for refusing to channel the GCIS budget to the Gupta brothers. While Manyi was in charge of the GCIS between February 2011 and August 2012, the Guptas received about R10 million. In total, GCIS spent more than R51 million on New Age breakfast events, which were aired live on the SABC. Gilliland said Treasury had identified 11 different bank accounts under different names. The supplier names were all Gupta media companies. Gilliland also told the commission how much each province spent on Gupta companies. The Free State spent the most with more than R75 million, followed by KZN, which paid more than R24 million. North West was third at more than R22 million. Gilliland said the total payment made by the government to Gupta entities amounted to over R260 million. The next witness expected to testify is former public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan. The commission will continue tomorrow.
