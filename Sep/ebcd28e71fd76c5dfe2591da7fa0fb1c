American neo-soul singer Erykah Badu had the crowd eating out of her hand at the DStv Delicious Festival. During her two-hour set at Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit on Sunday, she performed hits such as Time’s a Wastin’, Tyrone, Honey, The Healer and Bag Lady. At one point, she even tried to perform traditional Zulu dance moves. During an intimate press conference held after the show, she spoke about how she loved performing in South Africa and enjoyed every minute of her time on stage. Erykah recently shot a movie titled What Men Want. The movie, which features Taraji P Henson and Tracy Morgan, is due for release next year. When SunBuzz asked her about the experience, she said: “Taraji is an amazing person to work with. She is very sweet off camera. “When she plays her character Cookie Lyon on Empire, she is a tough person. “But she also has a tenderness that makes it easy to work with her. She made me feel comfortable in her world.” The singer said the three African artists she would like to work with are Anatii, Sean Kuti and Zap Mama, who she collaborated with on Bandy Bandy. Erykah encouraged young black women to believe in themselves.
