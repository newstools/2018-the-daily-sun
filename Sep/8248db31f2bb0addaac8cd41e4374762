THE Tshabalala family of Katlehong, Ekurhuleni are in shock after having to postpone a family member’s funeral. It was due to take place yesterday. The family said they had to put up with the incompetence of the Germiston Forensic Pathology Service. Boitshepo Tshabalala (19) committed suicide on Saturday and the police took his body to the government mortuary for a post mortem. Family spokeswoman Sibongile Tshabalala-Khanye said: “We were told to come back on Monday to collect the body. When we got there, no one wanted to help us. Workers said none of the bodies that came in during the weekend had been attended to.” The family were told to come back on Tuesday, but again had to leave without the remains. “Everything has been prepared, but we do not have a body. What kind of service is this?” Sibongile asked. The Sebola family from Tembisa, also in Ekurhuleni, faced a similar nightmare after Karabo Sebola (10) died in a car accident on Sunday and his body was taken to the mortuary. Karabo’s uncle, Sydney Sebola (42) said: “We have been camping outside the gate since Monday. We have to take the remains to Limpopo for burial. “We cannot go ahead with arrangements as we still do not know if we will get the body this week.” The acting forensic medical services CEO for Gauteng Health, Mosou Morule, said the department was aware of situation. He said pathologists at the centre were not satisfied with the protective equipment they had been supplied with and refused to work until new equipment was provided. “We met families on Tuesday and made arrangements to ensure we get bodies at the centre transported to other centres for post mortems. They will receive their loved ones’ remains as soon as those are completed.”
