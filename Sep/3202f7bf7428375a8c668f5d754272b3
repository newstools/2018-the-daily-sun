THE acting GCIS head Phumla Williams told the State Capture Commission of Inquiry that former minister of Communications Faith Muthambi wanted to steal at all cost. She further revealed that Muthambi was torturing her, and because of that she was having panic attacks. Williams told the inquiry that Muthambi’s actions were almost against the state. According to Williams, Muthambi’s actions seemed to be an effort to make GCIS appear dysfunctional in order look for support from outside government. Muthambi demoted Williams from the position of acting director-general to deputy director-general, in 2016. Williams explained that Muthambi, then forced her to pay back over R35 000 from her salary. “I never thought in this government, people would do this, I was tortured under the apartheid government. Muthambi did this to me. She wanted to steal at all costs,” Williams said. Williams said Muthambi wanted the supply chain department into the hands of someone that could be manipulated. She says was asked to come for an interview, and then she declined, because she had not applied for the position and she was unhappy she was invited by chief of staff and not HR. She explained that when she phoned HR, they didn’t even know about the interview she was invited to attend. Williams said she didn’t want to apply for post because of strained relationship. "When Minister Muthambi was transferred to the DPSA, she then wrote to the new minister, Minister Dlodlo, requesting that the two officials be transferred - Donald Liphoko and also Mr Zweli Momeka, made a request that they be transferred. In fact, one was to be transferred and the other was to be seconded with immediate effect, which I did the paperwork, to get them to be transferred to the DPSA," Williams said.
