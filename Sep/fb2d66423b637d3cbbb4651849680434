CONSTABLE Siboniso Buthelezi, who was murdered last Friday, was buried on Saturday. And as he was being buried two men, allegedly associated with his murder, were shot and killed at the hostel where he died. Police Minister Bheki Cele said cops identified the two men killed at the hostel in KwaMashu on Saturday and confirmed they were linked to Buthelezi’s death. He said when cops were being buried, thugs should also get buried. “It’s now a 50-50 situation,” he said, speaking at Buthelezi’s funeral at the Clermont Lutheran Church. “I met with the izinduna of the hostel and told them no one would sleep until suspects were found.” He said the operation continued and two men were killed and four arrested. Buthelezi’s brother Sakhile said: “I can see my brother was a hero as he died doing his work.” After the funeral Cele visited the scene at the hostel while cops were still working. A resident said the hostel was a hiding place for thugs. “Cops need to root them out.”
