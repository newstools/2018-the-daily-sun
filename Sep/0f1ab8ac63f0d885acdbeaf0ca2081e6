IT was a very emotional day full
of fond memories. The death of three siblings and
their cousin did not only shock Alexandra residents, but the entire country. Hundreds of Alexandra residents,
family and friends packed the Thusong community hall, to celebrate their lives. The four children died when
their house caught fire on Sunday. Their mothers locked them in the
house to go drinking. They were later arrested. Their little classmates rendered
musical items during the memorial service. Teachers, government officials
and residents celebrated Amukelani Ngubeni (2), Sandile Ngubeni (4), Nhlanhla
Ngubeni (7), and Mbali Fihlani (5). Some speakers took the
opportunity to voice their rage, which was directed at local mothers. Other speakers praised the
arrested mothers, despite their actions, which led to the tragic incident. Principal of Emfundisweni
Primary School, Thembakazi Giyama said she respected grandmothers for taking
care of their grandchildren when parents failed to do so. “Young parents don’t take care
of their children. They dump kids with us and never take full responsibility
when called by the schools. I don’t understand young mothers these days,” she
said. Giyama said the family was not
alone in their loss. Florence Manaka, Principal at
Ntokozweni Primary School said she was devastated by the incident. “I did nothing this entire week.
All I ever think about is these kids who lost their lives. We might have
written deceased in the register, but we will never forget them,” she said. Family member, Sisana Godloza
said the families were still in the dark. “We still don’t know what
happened. God gives and He takes. God wanted us to meet and come together
today‚ even as strangers,” she said. Meanwhile, Bongiwe Ngubeni (31)
and Nelisiwe Fihlani (28) face charges of culpable homicide, child abuse, child
neglect and deliberate neglect of a child. They remain in custody after
being denied bail.
