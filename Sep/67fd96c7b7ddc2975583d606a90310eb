WHEN you are jobless, any amount of money owed to you can go a long way towards easing the pain. But Nthabiseng Moiloa (28) has not been able to get an Unemployment Insurance Fund payout since she quit her job of two years at Thagamoso Resort in Zeerust, North West. Nthabiseng submitted documents to the department of labour so that she could get her UIF contributions from 2015 to 2017 – but she got a big shock when she was told by the local labour department she was still employed by a fishing company in Cape Town. She says she has never been to Cape Town, let alone outside her home town, and she suspects someone might have stolen her details to use to get a job. “I phoned the Calulo Fishing Company and they said they did not have a person by the name of Nthabiseng Moiloa there. “I went to the department of home affairs to find out if a second application for my ID exists and whether my own ID is a duplicate or not. “I have a written report that my ID is valid and no duplicate ID was made. “I never lost my ID, so I do not suspect fraud,” said Nthabiseng. Now the mother of three, from Dinokana near Zeerust, has been left jobless, moneyless and hopeless. The labour department’s spokesman for UIF matters, Makhosonke Buthelezi, told Daily Sun the department would investigate Nthabiseng’s case. “That complaint was referred to the Cape Town office for further assistance,” he said.
