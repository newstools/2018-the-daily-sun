BANYANA Banyana players will all get a chance to strut their stuff in the Cosafa Women’s Championships currently underway in Port Elizabeth, says head coach Desiree Ellis. This is part of her efforts to build a solid team for the upcoming Africa Women’s Cup of Nations in Ghana from 17 November to 1 December. If the reigning Cosafa Cup queens’ 2-1 victory over Madagascar on Wednesday is anything to go by, Ellis is on to something solid. Their group match journey continues today when they face noisy neighbours Botswana at Wolfson Stadium (3.30pm). Ellis said she would ring the changes for today’s game and expects improvement from her players. “More shots on target and converting chances win matches,” Ellis said. In their match against Madagascar, Banyana were without their Houston Dash trio of Thembi Kgatlana, Linda Motlhalo and captain Janine van Wyk, who only arrived from the USA on Wednesday. Said Ellis: “We will have a look at the players who joined us later and make a decision. But we have enough personnel and we need to field every player. “If you bring players to the tournament you must give them a chance. It doesn’t make sense to bring them and not use them. “Playing them is the only way you can see if they are ready for bigger challenges.”
