A THIEF thought he had covered his tracks and did not know his sins would soon catch up with him. He had apparently broken into the caretaker’s house at the KwaMashu J section’s soccer field and stolen a duvet cover, heater, curtains, takkies, radio, clothes and other items. On Friday he was caught selling some of the items at the KwaMashu Shopping Centre. Apparently he broke into the house three times, but when he returned for the fourth time on Thursday the caretaker saw his face. Thulani Nkosi told Daily Sun the thief and his friends broke into the house while he and the other caretaker, Lucky Mchunu were away. “I told residents and my friends about it, so if they saw someone selling my things they would tell me. “They came whenever we went out. It’s like they watched us when we left so they could come and steal. “I am sure he thought he’d never be caught. He said he had sold some items.” Thulani said the thieves had stolen his duvet cover, worth R 3000, and curtains. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said cases of housebreaking and theft were opened at KwaMashu Police Station. “A suspect was arrested and will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court today.”
