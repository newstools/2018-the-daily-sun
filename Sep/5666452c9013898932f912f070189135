WHITE River police in Mpumalanga have opened an inquest docket following the discovery of a burnt body on old Plaston Road, near KaBokweni. White River police spokeswoman, Sergeant Cynthia Mbokodo, said they received a complaint over the weekend about a person who was found burnt and dumped in the bush. “A community member who was asked to cut grass near the bush along Old Plaston Road directed the police to where the body was found,” she said. The person is believed to have been wearing grey socks and grey and white sneakers, which were found near the remains. She said it was difficult to estimate the age, race and gender as the body could not be identified. Only the skull and leg could be recognised. “We have not conducted any tests yet as and no one has come forward to report a missing person,” said Mbokodo. “We appeal to people who don’t know the whereabouts of one of their family members or who have opened a missing person’s case to come forward so we can conduct DNA tests.”
