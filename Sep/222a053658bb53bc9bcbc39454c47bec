Social grant recipients at Kwamhlanga are fed up at not getting their money on time. They complained about standing in long queues only to be told that there was no network, or the money was finished. Now the gogos and madalas want the old system of payment to return at community halls. The oldies said they cannot stand the heat and dust. They told Daily Sun they arrived early in the morning and queued the whole day without eating and were unable to take their medication. Sontokozo Mahlangu (45) said: “It’s too hot and there is a lot of dust caused by the wind. Some arrive early in the morning hoping to get their money in time, but they are told there is no network. “Sometimes they are told the money is finished. Disabled people are also forced to queue with normal people,” he said. Blind gogo Maria Sibanyoni (80) said she arrived at 6am but still didn’t get her any money. “I am forced to come back the next day. I spend money coming here and I don’t eat for the whole day,” she said. Simon Mahlangu (54) said: “Social grant money is our only source of survival at home. Right now, there is no food and I was hoping to get it in order to buy food. “My family is hungry, and they don’t understand when I tell them there is no money. We want the social grant payments back at community halls,” he said. Sassa spokesman, Senzeni Ngubeni said according to the information at their disposal the new system works perfectly. He said Sassa officials were monitoring all payments sites and assisted with queue management and other related queries. “The statistics at Sassa speak volumes about the number and majority of beneficiaries who have received their payments,” he said.
