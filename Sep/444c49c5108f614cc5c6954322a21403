A FATHER facing a murder charge after accidentally shooting his son dead appeared in court yesterday. The state asked the Lenasia Magistrates Court in Joburg to postpone the matter for the investigation into the incident to be completed. During his previous court appearance, Sibusiso Tshabalala (50) struggled to hold back his tears in front of a packed gallery but yesterday, he appeared composed. Defence lawyer Chewe Machaka said they wanted the matter finalised and there was no point taking it to the high court. “If push comes to shove, we will downgrade the charges to culpable homicide,” he said. Sibusiso shot his son Luyanda on the premises of Fred Norman Secondary School in Ennerdale in June after mistaking him for a hijacker. Sibusiso said he only realised he had shot Luyanda when he heard him saying: “Daddy, it’s me.” In an affidavit read out in court by his lawyer yesterday, he said: “The incident will haunt me for the rest of my life.” The case was postponed to Tuesday 16 October.
