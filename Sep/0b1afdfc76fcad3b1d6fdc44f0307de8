TWO pastors are at each other’s throat, and the unhloy war is not over souls but over land! They are fighting over an open space which each pastor claims belongs to him. Pastor Akinola Azamor, who is originally from Nigeria and is leader of Kings Parish Church, said the space in Orange Farm, south of Joburg, was registered under Redeemed Christian Church. He said Kings Parish Church falls under Redeemed Christian Church. The house next to the open space belongs to Bishop Peter Sekhonyane, who apparently uses the space to hold his Maranatha Revival Ministries’ church services. Azamor accused Sekhonyane of forcibly taking over 400 square metres of space when he erected a fence separating the two. Kings Parish Church hasn’t built any structures on the space and worshipping takes place in a school nearby. But Azamor claimed when they finally started construction work last week, the pillars were destroyed by the bishop’s men. “He’s been talking ill of me. For years he’s been trying to turn the community against me,” said Azamor. Sekhonyane denied the claims. “I’ve never insulted him and never tried to take his property. “I have nothing against him.”
