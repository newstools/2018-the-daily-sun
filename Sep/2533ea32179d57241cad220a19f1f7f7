SONWABILE Mancotywa of the Heritage Council visited Dolly Mzaidume’s grave on Monday. Dolly, a freedom fighter and member of the legislature, died in a car accident 23 years ago. Her children had been complaining about the ANC using her name without their consent. A hall in Bhisho and a street and ward in Mbizana have been named after her. Eldest daughter Bulelwa (38) said: “They want to use my mother’s name but don’t consult us. “They act as if we don’t exist. They claim to honour her but her tombstone is falling apart.” Bulelwa said Mancotywa’s visit had given them hope. “We thought our mother’s sacrifices were forgotten. We appreciate the efforts made by the council.” Dolly’s son Siyabulela Ntshinga (33) said he felt honoured for the first time since his mother’s death. “They’ve apologised to us. This will bring back dignity to my mother’s name,” he said. Mancotywa said he had met with Dolly’s son and understood the family’s pain. “I visited Dolly’s grave before speaking about her. I’ve advised the family to start a foundation in her name. It will sustain her memory and educate people.” He said the council could assist by shooting a documentary, organising memorial lectures and compiling manuscripts about her life. Secretary of the ANC’s Dolly Mzaidume branch Zamatita Ndabisa said they had heard the family’s wish to be consulted.
