CONTROVERSIAL funeral parlour boss and backer of former president Jacob Zuma Nkosentsha Shezi learnt at the weekend what it meant to be out in the cold. This as the self-labelled radical economic transformation champion found himself unceremoniously dumped out of a business breakfast function on Saturday. The function was organised by Umzansi Youth in Business at Imperial Hotel in Pietermaritzburg. A video shows him being manhandled and shoved out of the venue, apparently by bodyguards. He claimed the bodyguards who “attacked” him were instructed to do so. Shezi said he was invited and that while inside he protested as the minister was addressing the gathering. “I went to the front and asked Gordhan why he was victimising black people in the state-owned enterprises. Then I was attacked by bodyguards,” he claimed. By yesterday afternoon Shezi said he was still waiting for his legal team to open a case against the guards. He claimed he sustained “serious injuries” to the head and body.
