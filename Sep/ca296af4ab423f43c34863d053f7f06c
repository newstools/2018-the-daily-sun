A QUICK-THINKING woman cunningly avoided the horror of
rape by pretending to be dead. According to Coconuts, the unnamed former school teacher
in Thailand’s Sisaket province was home alone at about 3am last Saturday. It
was raining heavily so the streets around her home were mainly deserted when
suddenly an attacker broke into her house. The woman later told cops how the evil thug covered her mouth
with his hand, punched her in the stomach three times, and then pinned her on
the floor with his arm as he tried to rip off her clothes. “I tried to collect my thoughts and strength. And kept
poking at his collarbone until a fight broke out,” she told reporters from
Khaosod. “But the thief was too big for me, so I pretended to be dead instead.” It seems that the sight of her supposed corpse was enough
to make the thug panic and flee from the house. “Once I saw he had left, I ran outside to tell my neighbours
what had happened,” she said. “My cousins took me to the police station to file
a police report.” Cops have examined CCTV footage from five cameras in the
area but are still hunting the suspect.
