NORTH West Education MEC Jonas Lehare told parliament the Guptas lied about donating goods to 77 schools when applying for citizenship. MEC Lehare said four of the 77 schools mentioned are not on the department’s list of schools and don’t exist. Four others merged long ago. He said the Guptas contacted only 33. Lehare confirmed that some schools in the North West were involved in a wedding card design competition. It wasn’t a donation, as the Guptas had claimed. “The Guptas and Oakbay tricked our unsuspecting school principals into thinking the pupils and schools were participating in a drawing competition but they were designing invitations for the Gupta wedding in Sun City,” he said. The prizes included money, computers, football kits and stationery. The MEC said they lied about donating between R10 000 and R15 000 per school. He said the prizes should not be regarded as donations as the schools did work for the Guptas. He said Oakbay secretly gained access to the schools without proper permission. “In terms of our procedures, when you enter the province you must do so via the head office,” said Lehare. Rudie Heyneke, portfolio manager for the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse, told parliament the Guptas and Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba had a strong relationship. Heyneke based his presentation on the leaked Gupta emails. He said Gigaba was popular with the Gupta family and they invited him to several events, including the wedding at Sun City. ANC MP Donald Gumede asked Heyneke if they had established the facts or if they still allegations. Heyneke said: “I don’t think it’s the organisation’s business to establish facts. It’s up to law enforcement and the committee.”
