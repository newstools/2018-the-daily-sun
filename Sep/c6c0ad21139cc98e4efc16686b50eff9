WHEN two armed men stormed a tavern on Friday and ordered people to lie down on the ground, they didn’t realise they had met their match. Instead of lying down, one woman grabbed a hammer from under the bar counter and moered one of the men on the head! The suspect thought he would easily overpower the woman but she was too strong for him and she hit him so hard he fell to the ground. The other man then decided to cut his losses and fled on foot. People tried to give chase but the thug was too fast for them. However, the woman called the cops and when they arrived, they found a suspect already lying on the floor. The owner of the tavern in Tshepisong, near Kagiso in Mogale City, explained what had happened and the 30-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with business robbery. The woman said she was happy the thugs didn’t get her belongings. “When I saw one of the suspects taking my money and cellphone, I took a hammer and assaulted him. “I don’t know where I got the power to fight the armed man,” she said. “I thank God for protecting me. I could have been shot.” Police Captain Solomon Sibiya confirmed that the suspect was handed over to the cops and taken to Kagiso Police Station. “A business robbery case was opened and the suspect is expected to appear in the Kagiso Magistrates Court,” he said. Sibiya said cops were still looking for the other suspect.
