WHEN a grade 8 pupil (16) was stabbed on the streets, he went to the hospital. After he was discharged, he stayed at home for two weeks on the advice of his doctor. But instead of being welcomed back to school on his return, his furious principal allegedly gave him hot klaps. Daily Sun visited his family in Sebokeng zone 24 in the Vaal, south of Joburg, where the pupil’s mum (53) spoke about the alleged assault. She claimed she went to the school on Friday to explain why her child had been absent. But she was allegedly turned away because her son had failed to report the matter. “What was funny was that he had a letter from the hospital,” said the mum. “But the school didn’t listen to my child and wanted me to explain.” The mum said as they were sitting in the administration block, they saw the principal approaching. “He started asking my son questions,” she said. “As my son stood up and tried to talk to him, the principal klapped him. “We asked the principal why he was doing that, but he just stood up and left.” The mum said her attempts to open a case at Sebokeng Police Station were unsuccessful. “The police said the situation was self-inflicted, so we went to the department of education to lay a complaint. “Officials said they would call us to discuss the matter.” Education spokesman Steve Mabona told: “Our officials visited the school to probe the allegations. “It was discovered that no corporal punishment was administered by the principal. “An assault case wasn’t opened by the police because there was no evidence.”
