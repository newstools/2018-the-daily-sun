THE City of
Joburg is set to honour the late Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela with the Freedom
of the City award. The event
will take place on 25 September at the City’s Council Chambers. The City of
Johannesburg’s Category 1 Award, Conferment of the Freedom of the City, is
recognised as the highest honour that the Council can confer upon an individual
or group. Since 1996,
recipients of the award included the late Walter Sisulu, former President
Nelson Mandela, Joe Slovo, Dr Beyers Naude, Ahmed Kathrada, Sophie De Bruyn, Lillian
Ngoyi, Helen Joseph, Rahima Moosa, and in 2016 to Andrew Mlangeni and advocate
George Bizos. “Mama
Winnie Madikizela Mandela, the leader chosen to receive this award, represents
values enshrined in the Bill of Rights, values that should be upheld by all
citizens of South Africa irrespective of their religion, race, gender, age and
political party,” Council Speaker Vasco Da Gama said. “There are
many lessons that can be drawn from her life, lessons that empower, inspire and
build one’s integrity. “It is for
these reasons that it is important for the City of Johannesburg to recognize
the late Mama Madikizela Mandela by conferring the freedom of the City on her,
embracing her contribution not only to the establishment of a South African
democracy but to leadership development and community upliftment,” added Da
Gama. The family
of Mama Winnie is expected to attend the event to receive the award on her
behalf.
