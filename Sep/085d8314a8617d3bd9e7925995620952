HE needs to find his father, dead or alive! Blessing Mathibela (18) of Kwaggafontein in Mpumalanga is looking for his dad, who left in 1999 when his mum was seven months pregnant. His father, Fannie Lebombo, used to live with Blessing’s mum Zimkhona Mathibela (40) in Rethabiseng, Mpumalanga. He worked for a construction company in the area. Zimkhona said this had badly affected her son. She said Blesssing, a grade 10 pupil at Cibiliza Secondary, was not coping with his studies. “Fannie needs to connect with his son. Nothing is going well for him. This is even affecting him at school.” She described Blessing as intelligent. “I can see he’s a hard worker but he keeps repeating grades. He has never had behavioural problems but lately he has become short-tempered,” she said. The only information she had about Fannie was that he was from Hammanskraal, Pretoria. Blessing and Zimkhona visited sangoma Emma Mgidi, who told them he needed to meet his father’s family. “People are different and so are ancestors of different families. This clan seems to follow strict rules for their rituals. “If any of them skips them, they find themselves in hot water,” said Mgidi. She encouraged Blessing to find his father. Blessing told Daily Sun: “This is really affecting me. I’m always stressed out. This is not just about the rituals I need to go through. There are certain things in life I can’t talk to my mother about.”
