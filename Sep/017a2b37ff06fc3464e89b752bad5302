HIS family did not face his alleged killer when he appeared in court yesterday. The family of Oyingcwele Zokufa (2) was dealing with the arrival of his body at their home in Nkandla squatter camp. Read: MISSING KIDS FOUND DEAD! They held a prayer service and traditional preparations before his body had to leave for burial in the Eastern Cape. Alleged killer Mzimhle Jikwana (32) made his first appearance in the Wynberg Magistrates Court yesterday. Oyingcwele’s uncle, Sikelela Zokufa, said the boy starved to death. “There are no marks on his body and he died from hunger. “Tests showed the last food he had was that his mother gave him before his disappearance.” Oyingcwele went missing from Philippi East, Cape Town last Sunday after attending church with his mum, Siphesihle Zokufa (24). His body was found on Thursday. His family suspected Jikwana from the start, as he had an argument with Siphesihle after he dated her cousin. Then Oyingcwele disappeared. Siphesihle cried uncontrollably when her son’s body arrived at the family home and said she wasn’t ready to talk. The family said Jikwana toyed with them after he took the boy, telling them to fetch him and then not showing up. He also threatened to dump him in the bush. After cops apparently found Jikwana hiding under his bed, he showed them where he buried Oyingcwele’s body in a shallow grave close to the N2. The state has opposed bail for Jikwana, accusing of abduction and murder. Oyingcwele will be laid to rest today in Ngxakana Village in Dutywa, Eastern Cape.
