WHEN Scelo Mncube was born 26 years ago, he came out feet first, instead of the head. Children born this way are considered a blessing. He said his mum died when he was a teenager and left him a letter telling him he was a product of rape. Scelo said his mother’s family rejected him and he was forced to live on the streets of Durban between 2006 and 2009. “I found myself alone, but I was determined not to allow the mean street life take over my dreams. “I read a lot and always knew I wasn’t destined to live on the streets.” He was taken in by a stranger in 2011 and, in 2013, he went to audition at the Ukhozi FM studios. They were looking for motivational speakers. “The late gospel star S’fiso Ncwane heard me speaking on Ukhozi and invited me to speak at one of his events. That event changed my life,” said Scelo. He recently published a book titled I was Raped And You Were Born, based on the letter his mum left him. Scelo is a motivational speaker for rape survivors. He also preaches against women and child abuse.
