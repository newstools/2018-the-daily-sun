A SHORT, polished and clear pitch is what helps your business grow. That was the message for the 268 businessmen and women attending the Engen Pitch and Polish workshop. It took place on Saturday at the Olive Conversion Centre in Durban. The national workshop programme has already helped 10 000 businessmen and women to improve their pitch to investors. Saturday’s event was attended by both up-and-coming and established businesspeople. People could pitch their business ideas to each other and learn to do it the proper way Ayanda Mbeje (28) from Umlazi said he plants vegetables. “I started my business pitch in 2016 and came to the workshop because I wanted to learn more about marketing,” he said. “Now I know a short and clear pitch will help me get investors. “I also learned people don’t want to know about you but want to know what you can do for them.” Nonhle Mtolo (23) from the Bluff said she has a gardening service. “It’s a family business but I’m running it now. “The workshop taught me a lot and now I know fhow to grow the business. I need to advertise it well and also know my target market because not everyone needs my services.” Co-ordinator Justin Cohen said people learnt a lot. “It helped them polish their pitch as one can have a great idea but not know how to launch it or have a product but not know how to interest consumers. “The workshop teaches people how to position ideas and to market prodcts,” Cohen said.
