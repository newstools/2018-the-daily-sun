THE students protested for three weeks when they couldn’t get their money from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. But nothing happened. On Monday they burned an office at King Sabata Dalindyebo College. Students complained about not receiving their monthly allowances from the scheme since last year. They stopped attending lectures and accused management of not resolving the issue. Aseza Xulu, chairwoman of the SRC, said: “Some students who hadn’t received their allowances were apparently omitted from the system. We don’t know who is at fault. Is it the college or the financial aid scheme? “We are confused. We submitted all the documents required when applying for financial aid. “The reason we got from the college is that some students were omitted because they didn’t submit all the relevant documents.” Xulu said they decided to protest because they couldn’t get proper answers. Last week students were promised that they would be paid their outstanding allowances by Friday, 30 August. But that didn’t happen. Kagiso Mamabole, a spokesman for the financial aid scheme, said they were not even aware of the allowance problem. “I haven’t been briefed about King Sabata Dalindyebo College, so I can’t talk about that until we get the full report. “But we have set aside R2,2 billion to assist all students from colleges and universities.” The college spokesman couldn’t be reached for comment at the time of going to print. Student Sisipho Bulo said they wanted the money and wouldn’t attend lectures until they were given their grants. “We need that money to live,” he said.
