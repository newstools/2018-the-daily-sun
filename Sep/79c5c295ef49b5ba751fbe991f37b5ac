THE madala had a brand new toilet installed in his yard but he still has to use a bucket toilet. That’s because the contractor never connected the sewerage pipes at his house in Matikiring kasi, near Clocolan. Madala Ramphomeng Ramokoatsi said he was happy when the contractor built a flush toilet in his yard. “I thought my days of using buckets were over at last but my problems were only starting. The contractor never finished the installation. “I have gone to Setsoto Municipality many times. They said they would come and see what the problem was but no one bothered to help.” He said he hated the bucket system but was better off without a useless trench in his yard. “I know when it’s election time they will come running to get my vote, but my toilet will never be fixed.” Municipal spokeswoman Moroesi Gaba said: “This particular house couldn’t be connected to the new sewerage line because of an existing toilet structure the owner refused to demolish. “This structure is at the exact point where new connections must pass through to avoid the risk of blockages. “Until the owner agrees to demolish the old structure, the new connections can’t be completed.”
