ENTERTAINMENT queen and media personality Bonang Matheba is flying Mzansi’s flag higher and higher. The famous philanthropist has now been asked to be a lead moderator at a United Nations General Assembly discussion in New York. The discussion, “Leave No Girl Behind”, will see Bonang on a panel with French President Emmanuel Macron; Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau; the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Theresa May and Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg. The discussion on girls’ education and empowerment will cover ways of achieving quality education for all girls globally by 2030. It will include a number of respected professionals in the field as well as advocates from Global Citizen, who are arranging the panel discussion. Bonang said: “I believe that when you educate a girl child, you actually educate a community and you also educate a family.” Bonang recently won an International Achievement Recognition Award for Best Media Personality. She will speak at a special Global Citizen function before attending the Global Citizen Festival in New York on 29 September. Global Citizen is a worldwide movement of citizens using their collective voice to end extreme poverty by 2030.
