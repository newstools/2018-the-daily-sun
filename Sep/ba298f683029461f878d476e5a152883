GONE are the days when the Free State was regarded a safe haven. This as Sam Mashinini, the MEC of Police, Roads and Transport, released the annual crime statistics on Wednesday with a shocking 10,9% increase in the rate of murder. Stock theft also grew by 9,7 %, common robbery increased by three cases, while cash-in transit heists soared by a massive 50%. The MEC said police would stop at nothing to make sure they bring criminals to book. Contact crimes, including sexual offences, attempted murder, assault and robbery with aggravated circumstances were down by 5,3%. Arson and malicious damage to property also decreased by 8,9%. Mashinini said when stock theft was taken together with the broad category of property-related crimes such as burglary at residential premises, burglary at non-residential premises and theft of motor vehicle, such crimes decreased by 3,6%. Illegal possession of firearms and ammunition, drug-related crimes and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs increased by 6,6%. “Although the broad categories of crime show a good and convincing decrease, we will prioritise and double our efforts while dealing with contact crimes during our interventions,” said the MEC. He said 2 489 people were arrested on the province’s roads for speeding, with the highest speed registered being 246km/h.
