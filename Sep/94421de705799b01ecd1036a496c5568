THE young couple led a lavish life.They were the envy of many, with their beautiful home and luxury cars.But behind closed doors, something was terribly wrong!On Saturday, Willem Maseko (30) was found dead in his home, apparently after being stabbed with a knife.Over the last 48 hours, the case has gone viral on social media, with users asking the public to help find the killer, who fled the scene. Yesterday, it was confirmed that a 26-year-old woman had been arrested in connection with the murder, which took place at Maseko’s home in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, in the early hours of the morning. She apparently handed herself in to police. Police spokesman Sergeant David Ratau said the suspect allegedly stabbed Maseko after an argument about a man who had visited the suspect at their home. Sources told the SunTeam the visit occurred the day before the murder. “When Maseko got home, he found a visitor and told the suspect he didn’t appreciate the person being in his home. The visitor was then shown the door,” said a source. “The victim and the suspect then got involved in a quarrel and she allegedly stabbed him twice. After realising what she had done, she took one of the cars and fled to Tshwane. The car was later found but she was missing without a trace.” Ratau confirmed that a suspect was arrested, saying: “It’s still unclear what caused the incident to occur but a murder case has been opened and investigations are already under way.” A memorial service for Maseko will be held tomorrow at 3pm at the Witbank Civic Centre.
