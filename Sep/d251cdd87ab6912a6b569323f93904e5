ABOUT 100 women gathered on Monday to give advice to other women. The event was organised by a group called Mmokeng Wa-mafumahadi at Rocklands in Mangaung. The group was formed early last year to bring women together to talk about their problems. Group spokeswoman Mantele Mosamo (38) told Daily Sun: “We started this group after we realised most women had problems at home. Some of them are even abused by their husbands or kids. “We have 15 members who visit women facing problems to give them hope. We always advise them to wake up and do something with their lives instead of depending on men.” Mantele said they advise women on how to manage money. They also tell them it’s never too late to go back to school to live a better life. “This is the third event we’ve held and we invited 150 women to share their problems with us so we can give them advice.” Mantele said group members donated R50 every month to pay for events such as this. “When you have a problem, don’t keep it to yourself. Go and seek help,” she said. “We’re planning to hold a session for girls aged between eight and 20 before December to guide them on how to live as young women.” Councillor Manana Chaka was invited to speak at the event as well as financial advisors, motivational speakers and artists. Nowinile Rasmeni (40) said: “I was invited to the event and I learned a lot. They told us to be independent and to visit therapists if we have problems in our marriages. Most of us black people don’t believe in therapy but today my eyes were opened. They also told us it’s never too late to go back to school.”
