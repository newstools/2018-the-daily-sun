GETTING trapped inside a squatter camp toilet is no joke. And getting covered in sewage trying to get out isn’t funny, either. But this is the humiliation residents of Angelo squatter camp in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, have had to endure ever since their toilet door started getting stuck. Residents can get inside the toilet easily enough but getting out is a mission. They told Daily Sun the toilet door locks itself from the outside. The problem has angered residents, who have threatened to burn the portable toilets in the area if the municipality doesn’t give them flush toilets. Victim Frans Mathabela (33) said he had a horrific experience after getting stuck in the toilet. Frans said he tried to push the door open, but the whole structure fell over with him inside and he got soaked in kak. Frans said after what happened to him, he stopped using the toilet and started relieving himself in the bushes. Lorraine Ngema said she got stuck in the toilet and had to wait for hours until her child came home from school and saved her. Phineas Nkau told Daily Sun he was lucky when he got stuck as his neighbour heard his screams for help. “We want toilets but not these types,” he said. Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said he would refer the matter to the relevant department.
