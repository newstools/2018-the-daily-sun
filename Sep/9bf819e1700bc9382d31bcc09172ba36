 COMMUNICATIONS minister Nomvula Mokonyane says the South
African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has been grants a borrowing limit of
R1.2 billion. Mokonyane says this is in line with the Public Finance
Management Act (PFMA) as well as the responsibilities of the board of directors
of the SABC. Briefing the media, Mokonyane said the SABC has suffered a
R622 million net loss for the 2017/18 financial year, as compared to the
previous year, which was R972 million. She highlighted that there has been progress in addressing
the concerns that were previously raised by the auditor general, in its
previous annual report. Mokonyane added that the current board has been able to set
the broadcaster on a path of recovery. Regarding the suppliers that are state owed by the state
entity have been engaged with a view of settling outstanding payments owed to
them. This after one of their most popular show, Uzalo stopped production
last week citing financial troubles on the side of the SABC. "The SABC board and management have assured employees
of the broadcaster, that they will continue to receive their salaries. Equally suppliers owed by the broadcaster have been in
engagements with the SABC and there's been progress in effecting payments to
creditors," Mokonyane said.
