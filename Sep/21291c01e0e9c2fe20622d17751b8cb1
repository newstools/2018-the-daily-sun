THEMBI Ngwenya is in need of help. Her son Puty (13) suffers from a chronic liver and skin disease, which requires them to visit hospital every now and then for check-ups. But the 42-year-old mother is jobless as she had to stop working to take care of Puty. They depend on his social grant, which is not enough. Thembi, from Buhlebesizwe near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun: “My son’s sickness started when he was five years old. I spend most of the social grant money on medication. Doctors said we need to stay in a proper house so that Puty can stop inhaling dust. We live in a shack.” She said she was told that RDP houses in their section would be built after 10 years. “I cannot wait that long as my son’s condition needs extra care,” she said. Thembisile Hani municipal spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane said they would ask the ward councillor to assess Thembi’s situation. She said supporting documents from a doctor would make it easier to put them on a priority list to get a house.
