poking! MTV listed these record-making sex facts. Prepare to be
amazed... 1. Most sex in a
day A porn star called Lisa Sparks is said to have poked the
most people within a 24-hour period. Her record? Set in October 2004, she poked
919 men, spending 94 seconds with each one. 2. The furthest
ejaculation Horst Schultz claims to have set the record for
ejaculating the furthest distance. His record is just short of six metres. 3. Longest orgasm This amazing record has been standing for 52 years. Set

2006, when 250 couples (500 people) gathered together for a joint poke. It wasn’t
