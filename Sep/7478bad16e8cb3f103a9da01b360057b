TWO passenger trains crashed and over 100 people were injured, in the Eloff extension in Selby, south of Johannesburg. ER24 Russel Meiring said when paramedics arrived on the scene, they found both trains upright and on the tracks. “Numerous people had already climbed off of the train and were walking around on the scene,” Meiring said. Emergency services set up a triage area and began to assess the patients. “Approximately 100 patients were assessed and found to have sustained minor to moderate injuries. Fortunately, no serious injuries or fatalities were found,” Meiring added. The patients were treated for their injuries and were thereafter transported by several services to nearby hospital. Meiring said the detail surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
