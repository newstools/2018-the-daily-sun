MADALA William Sikhosana needs help. The 78-year-old’s leg is swollen and has a big wound, and he can no longer walk properly. The wound was just a small pimple in December. To make matters worse, he lives alone in a shack in Zakheni, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga. He said the pain was unbearable and sangomas and doctors had failed to help him. “I can’t sleep at night because of the pain,” he said. “I use my grant to pay sangomas and prophets but nothing changes,” said madala William. “This wound is going to kill me. Even painkillers no longer help. “My shack leaks and I’m not safe. I was attacked by three thugs. “I managed to fight them off with my walking stick, but they broke the door down.” Sangoma Ndlulamithi Ndlovu said the madala’s wound might have been caused by evil people. Thembisile Hani municipal spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane told Daily Sun that William needed to provide her with his ID so she could check his status on the system. Mashiyane said if the madala’s name wasn’t on the system, he would be assisted to register for an RDP. Dr Bob-John Masango, a medical doctor, said the madala needed to be diagnosed to determine the cause of the problem. Masango said William’s wound might have been caused by diabetes.
