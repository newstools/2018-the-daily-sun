PHUMZILE Mbatha sat on the mattress in tears as she shared what happened on the day she lost her sons. Sabelo (10) and Sanele (5) died on Tuesday, allegedly as a result of food poisoning. Phumzile’s other child, Sinenhlanhla (7), is said to be recovering at the Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. The 33-year-old mum from Katlehong sat next to the children’s dad Bongani Ngondo (40) as they shared fond memories of their kids. Phumzile told Daily Sun on that fateful day she was given some food by a tenant. According to her, the tenant usually shared food with the children. The container contained pap, chicken and potatoes. “I warmed up the food and gave it to them. When I took Sabelo and Sinenhlanhla to school, there was no sign that they were not feeling well,” said Phumzile. But when she returned home, Sanele complained about his stomach and feeling dizzy. She said at the time, she thought he might be constipated. “A teacher came to the house to inform us that Sabelo was ill and complained about similar symptoms to Sanele. “Just as I was getting ready to go to the clinic where Sabelo was, Sanele started having seizures. “When he was taken to the car, yellow foam started coming out of his mouth,” she said. Sinenhlanla also had the same symptoms while at school and was also rushed to the clinic. He was referred to a hospital. Bongani said his sons loved one another and used to play together. He said Sinenhlanhla and Sanele used to argue a lot and Sabelo was the peacemaker. Phumzile said: “They told me that they would work to buy me a house.” Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the school and the grieving family. “What is important is to establish the cause of the deaths and who is responsible. I can confirm that colleagues from the health department have already taken a sample of the food,” said Lesufi. He said an independent forensic unit would analyse all the findings.
