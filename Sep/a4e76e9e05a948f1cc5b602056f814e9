LUYANDA Qononda (31) declared his guilt five times during his appearance at Mthatha High Court yesterday. He was given a 25-year-sentence after being found guilty of five counts of rape. One of his victims was an 82-year old gogo. Qononda was also given a five-year sentence for housebreaking. The sentences will run at the same time. He had earlier entered into a plea bargain with the state. Judge Fatima Dawood said Qononda showed remorse during his time in court but described his actions as still inexcusable. She said the state had an overwhelming case against him. “These heinous and cowardly crimes against defenceless women are condemned in the strongest terms, taking into account the trauma the victims went through. “The sentence is in the interests of justice,” said Dawood. The charges related to incidents that took place in 2012 and 2015. State prosecutor Luvuyo Pomolo said Qononda used to observe his victims during the day before breaking into their houses in the evening.
