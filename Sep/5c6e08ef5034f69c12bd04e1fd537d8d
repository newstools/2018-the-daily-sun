COPS often urge communities to work with them instead of taking the law into their own hands. Three suspects were bust in Bethlehem last week after residents cornered one of them. Instead of beating the 23-year-old woman, residents handed her over to the police. The cops then searched for the other two suspects until they were found. Police said the suspects allegedly robbed a woman (48) and her daughter (13) at their home in Giyani kasi. “Her two TV sets, cellphones and jewellery were taken during the robbery,” said police spokesman Captain Zweli Mohobeleli. “One of the suspects was confronted by residents before she was handed over to the police. “Further police investigation led to the arrest of two more suspects, a woman aged 21 and a man of 20. They were cornered by officers in the Bethlehem CBD. “Cops are investigating whether three burglaries that happened at different houses in Giyani are linked to the suspects. “They will appear in the Bethlehem Magistrates Court soon.” Bethlehem commander Major-General Jan Tsotetsi thanked residents for helping cops fight crime. “The residents’ immediate involvement of the police has led to two more arrests. Our streets will be crime-free if we continue working together.”
