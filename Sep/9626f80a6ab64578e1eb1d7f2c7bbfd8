MOTORISTS are relieved that their pleas have been heard. A huge pothole on the R81 near Ga-Sekgopo Village outside Modjadjiskloof, Limpopo has been fixed. The People’s Paper published a story on 16 August titled: “Potholes nightmare for drivers.” Motorists had complained that the South African National Roads Agency did not care about their lives as it was not fixing the road. Motorists said they were grateful to Daily Sun for helping to resolve the matter. Tumelo Maringa (34) said driving on the road would no longer be a nightmare. “We thank Daily Sun for helping to get the road fixed,” she said. The pothole had taken up a portion of one lane, making it difficult for motorists to pass. Another motorist, Mike Molewa (47) said: “Our lives and vehicles will now be safe. We just hope that the road will stay the same and that the roads agency will step in on time to assist whenever there are problems.”
