THEY risk life and limb to help pupils cross the street to school safely – and they’re only kids themselves! Yesterday, scholar patrollers from 300 schools around Joburg were honoured for their service to their fellow pupils, braving the elements through all four seasons. The Joburg Metro cops made sure their efforts didn’t go unnoticed and treated about 3 000 patrollers to a day of fun at Wembley Stadium in Turffontein. Joined by their teachers and members of the Metro police community safety department, the volunteers were treated like royalty. As the patrollers filled the stadium, a sea of orange caps could be seen. Music was played and the kids were entertained by a pantsula group, the Metro police brass band and the City of Joburg’s mascots. Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said: “These patrollers stand in the rain, in the hot sun and in the cold to help other pupils cross the road safely. “The Metro cops also express their gratitude to the teachers without whose support the patroller programme would not be possible.” Minnaar said the duties the kids performed developed strong characters and leadership skills. “One day, they might even find themselves becoming Metro police officers,” Minaar said. The pupils each received a medal to remember their achievement.
