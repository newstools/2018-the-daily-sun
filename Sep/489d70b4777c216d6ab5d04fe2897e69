THOUSANDS of commuters had to scramble for alternative transport when trains didn’t operate. The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa announced over the weekend that it had suspended all train operations in KZN. This came after its staff and property were attacked at Umlazi railway station on Friday. “I hope the people who burned the trains can see the problem they created,” said an angry commuter. Passengers had a hard time getting to work as buses and taxis struggled to cope with the demand. Long queues started forming at taxi ranks around Durban from the early hours of the morning. When the SunTeam visited a taxi rank in Umlazi, south of Durban, a large number of people were queuing for a ride. Dumisani Mkhungo (37) said he got to the rank before 5am because he had to be at work by 6am. He was still waiting for a taxi at 7am. “I’ve told my bosses I’d be late. “I hope they understand because they know the trains aren’t operating,” he said. Some said they feared losing their jobs because they knew their bosses wouldn’t be pleased if they arrived late. One woman in the queue said her bosses told her they would have to replace employees who came late because the machinery they used had to be up and running by 6am. KZN Prasa spokesman Zama Nomnganga said he sympathised with innocent passengers who were affected by the actions of a few vandals. He said Prasa was discussing the problem with KZN Transport and Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda. Nomnganga said the trains would hopefully start operating again by Friday.
