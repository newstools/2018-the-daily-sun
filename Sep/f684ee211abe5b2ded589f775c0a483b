THEIR precious five-year-old boy suffers from hydrocephalus, or water on the brain. The condition has left little Clight Mbethete in constant pain. Also, Clight’s mobility is limited and he cannot walk or sit on his own. His desperate parents, Lucy Manyike and Shadrach Mbethete (46), from Relane Maromeng in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga told Daily Sun their son has been in and out of Mapulaneng and Rob Ferreira hospitals. “His head looks swollen. I was told Rob Ferreira Hospital would be a better place to treat my son, but nothing has changed. “My son’s head keeps getting bigger and the pain is still there,” said Lucy. “I was told by one of the doctors that his brain was much smaller than the average brain of children who have the same condition.” Shadrach said since they were told by a doctor that nothing could be done to help their child, he had become depressed. Health department spokesman Dumisani Malamule said doctors are not allowed to tell patients that nothing can be done to help them. “If indeed it is found that there is not much that doctors here can do, we will ensure that the child is referred to the relevant hospital to be assisted,” said Malamule.
