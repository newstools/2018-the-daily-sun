THANKS to Leuta Molaoa, what used to be an illegal dump has been turned into a playground. For years, the 51-year-old from Botshabelo section L in Mangaung, Free State watched unhappily as people dumped rubbish not far from his home. He decided to do something about the situation. As the former construction worker had been unemployed for more than 10 years, he created work for himself. Leuta turned the dump site into a park where kids from neighbouring sections can rent wire toys he made himself. “I could no longer stand the unbearable smell coming from the site, so in August I started cleaning it with my friend Abel Machakela,” he said. The father of three said kids gathered at his house every day after school to rent toy cars. “I charge a kid R1 for 10 minutes,” he said. Leuta also teaches kids about road signs and how to drive cars. He sells toy cars to kids who can afford to buy them.
