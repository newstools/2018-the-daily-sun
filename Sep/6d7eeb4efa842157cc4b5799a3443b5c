MURDERED businessman Caswell Maseko was reportedly planning to leave his wife when she allegedly stabbed him to death. This was the claim made by Maseko’s ex-wife, Thembisile Masanabo (29), who claimed he told her three times he wanted to leave Itumeleng Makhalemele-Maseko to get back together with her. “Last March, he started talking about divorce and he did file for it but I don’t know what happened for him not to proceed with it,” Thembisile claimed. “He really wanted to leave her and used to complain she was too controlling,” she claimed “We were planning our future together and death robbed us of the chance to live happily ever after,” she alleged. “I was happy when my former mother-in-law, who died last year, asked for forgiveness from me, saying she didn’t know previously that I was was the right woman for her son.” Thembisile said she didn’t know how she would move on because she and Caswell, who was murdered in Emalahleni in Mpumalanga last Saturday, were still friends and had a son together. She did not believe rumours that Caswell might have abused Itumeleng (26), claiming: “He never lifted a finger against me. She said she was married to Caswell from 2010 until 2015. It was that year, she claimed, that Itumeleng became his nyatsi. Caswell was laid to rest on Saturday in Emalahleni. Itumeleng was bust last week for allegedly stabbing him and will appear in the Witbank Magistrates Court on Thursday.
