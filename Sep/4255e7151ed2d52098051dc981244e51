FOLLOWING several disputes over the chieftaincy of their community, the matter has reached the Polokwane High Court. The fight is between Moshohli Letsoalo and his cousin Malesela Letsoalo from Metz Village, outside Tzaneen in Limpopo. Moshohli, who claimed to be the rightful chief, said his cousin refused to hand over the throne to him. Moshohli claimed when Malesela took over from his dad, who was a regent, he was never told about the matter. He said he couldn’t just watch while his throne was handled by his cousin, even though they knew he was the legitimate chief of the community. “I started talking to them in 2015, but they never wanted to hand over the throne to me. “I asked the co-operative and traditional affairs department for all the relevant documents for our chieftaincy. Now I have all the evidence to challenge them in court. “I am the rightful chief of the community and I want what is due to me. All those who took over after my dad were regents as I was too young. Now Malesela doesn’t want to hand over what is rightfully mine,” he said. Collen Letsoalo, a representative in Malesela’s council, said as a family they were still talking about the matter and wouldn’t discuss it with the media. He said after several family meetings, the council had decided to leave the matter with the court.
