The 10th annual Feather Awards nominations were announced in Johannesburg this afternoon and already there is drama! The organizers have announced that they are withdrawing model and fitness trainer, Tumi Seeco’s nomination with immediate effect. This as the team behind the awards received major backlash for nominating someone who has, in the past, made homophobic comments. Tumi was nominated in the Hunk of the Year category alongside actors, Thabang Molaba and Bohang Moeko. Twitter quickly went into a frenzy when the nomination was announced, digging up old tweets depicting Tumi’s homophobic rants. “My son must know [that] if he ever turns gay, he won’t have a father, highly impossible though, his genes won’t allow,” Tumi tweeted in 2012. FEATHER AWARDS 2018 NOMINEES REVEALED! “I think that’s how you get gay children, they witness their dad getting beat by the mom,” he said in another 2012 tweet. The Feather Awards have since released a statement that officially announces the de-nomination. “As an event dedicated to fighting homophobia and discrimination against sexual minorities, the Feather Awards has a zero tolerance attitude to such prejudice,” they said. They went on to announce that he will now be replaced by Advocate Dominic Khumalo, aka ANC bae, who is a researcher in the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services. “The Feather Awards extends their heartfelt congratulations to the advocate on the occasion of his nomination and wishes him all the best in the run-up to awards,” said the Feathers team.
