Time flies when you’re having fun. This is what songbird Lira and her husband Robin Kohl must be feeling after they reached a major milestone in their relationship. The pair celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary over the weekend. While they are one of the most private couples, they could not help but share their special day with the rest of the world through social media. Lira took to Instagram to share a few pictures of herself and her husband and left a lovely little message as well. “I said “I DO” to the love of my life, my bestie, my partner in the dance of life! Life is really awesome with you Sthandwa!” she captioned one of the pictures. She also left a lovely little birthday note for her husband. “Happy Birthday my love. May all your dreams continue to come true, may all your goals be reached and may you be blessed with good health and prosperity,” she added. 09-09-2009 I said “I DO” to the love of my life, my bestie, my partner in the dance of life ????!
