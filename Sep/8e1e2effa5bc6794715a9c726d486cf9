Serena Williams went topless for a breast cancer campaign and social media is going crazy! The tennis superstar posted a video of herself singing a version of The Divinyls global hit “I Touch Myself” for Breast Cancer Awareness month to remind women to self-check regularly. “Yes, this put me out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because it’s an issue that affects all women of all colors, all around the world. Early detection is key— it saves so many lives,” she said on Instagram. Williams said that the music video is part of the “I Touch Myself Project” which was created in honor of, Chrissy Amphlett, who passed away from breast cancer. This Breast Cancer Awareness Month I’ve recorded a version of The Divinyls global hit “I Touch Myself” to remind women to self-check regularly. _ Yes, this put me out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because it’s an issue that affects all women of all colors, all around the world. Early detection is key - it saves so many lives. I just hope this helps to remind women of that. _ The music video is part of the I Touch Myself Project which was created in honor of celebrated diva, Chrissy Amphlett, who passed away from breast cancer, and who gave us her hit song to remind women to put their health first.
