IT seems KZN is blessed with more twins than any other province in the country. Last month, Daily Sun ran a story about Nqobane Primary School in Mariannhill, outside Durban, which threw a party for its 42 sets of twins. The People’s Paper has discovered another school that’s blessed with twins. Hlengisizwe Primary School in Folweni, south Durban, marked Heritage Month last Friday by celebrating their 18 twins. Teacher Buyile Chili said they felt blessed to have so many twins in their school. She said they were planning a big party for them. “We could have done it a long time ago but we didn’t have funds. We would like to appeal to businesses or anyone who can help raise funds. “We will choose the birth date of one pair and throw a party for all of them,” said Chili. She said the twins were in various grades. Chili said the school not only had pupils who were twins, but teachers as well, although their siblings didn’t teach at the school. She said after learning that Nqobane Primary threw a party for their twins, they were encouraged to organise one for their own pupils. “All the teachers have committed to approaching business people for donations. “We will be knocking on every business door to ask them to make this day a success. “A child is a precious gift from God, so how much more of a blessing are twins? “We need to celebrate this rare gift,” said Chili.
