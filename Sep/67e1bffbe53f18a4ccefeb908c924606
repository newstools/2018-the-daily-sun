AFTER Nurse Nzimande went blind at the age of eight, she grew tired of sewing and doing beadwork at school. She could feel her dream of becoming a social worker slipping through her fingers. So she begged her teacher to help her find a school where she could write her matric exam. Now the 20-year-old from Brighton in Ermelo, Mpumalanga, is one step closer to realising her dream. She is preparing to write her final exams in November. Nurse, a former pupil at Sibonile School for the Blind, said: “My teacher recommended that I go to Joburg Society for the Blind, which offers a programme that helps blind people obtain matric certificates.” Nurse said she was doing her NQF level 4 studies at City Deep Adult Learning Centre. “I started this year and I’m very happy. “The organisation taught me how to use a computer for the visually impaired.” She said her blindness came without warning. “I lost my vision and walked into the school fence.” Nurse said she never had any eye problems before the incident. “Thanks to the support I received from friends and family, I’ve accepted my condition.”
