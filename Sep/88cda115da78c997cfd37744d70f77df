THABANG Mosiako will spearhead South Africa’s attack at the second annual FNB Durban 10km CitySurfRun event on 14 October. The first South African across the finish line on Monday at the third annual Joburg 10km CityRun, Mosiako was beaten by Eritrea’s Filmon Ande, Uganda’s Mande Bushendich and course record holder, Namakoe Nkhasi from Lesotho. He was the strongest of the SA contingent and will be keen to continue his return to form after the attack in February that nearly cost him his career and his life. “I am getting fitter and fitter all the time. I was happy with my race on Monday. It was only in the last 3km that I was not able to stay with Ande, Bushendich and Nkhasi. “But I have three weeks left until the race and will be in better shape by then,” he added. Mosiako will be joined by a strong field including Elroy Gelant and the impressive Ryan Mphahlele. Also already confirmed for the men’s race is defending champion Joshua Cheptegei.
