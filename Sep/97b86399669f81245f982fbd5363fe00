SECURITY companies who hire criminals will have their licences revoked and on top of that get a R1 million fine. The Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority vowed to deal harshly with security companies that hire hitmen. CEO of the organisation, Manabela Chauke, said companies that employed people without checking their criminal records were breaking the law. He was speaking at the private security indaba organised by provincial government in Durban yesterday. The event was attended by eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede, Transport and Community Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda, and KZN Premier Willies Mchunu. Chauke said they were cleaning up the industry and getting rid of hitmen who pretended to be protectors but who killed their opponents at night. He said a number of companies were in the regulator’s spotlight and serious action would be taken against those found guilty. He said he couldn’t name them. “But once we have finished our investigation you will know about them,” said Chauke. Kaunda said his department organised the summit to come up with ways to prevent the killings. He said the killings were mainly being committed in the taxi industry. Kaunda expressed concern that some taxi security guards were stopping and searching vehicles, which wasn’t their job. “We are aware that these security guards are also being used as hitmen by those who hired them,” said Kaunda. Mchunu called on people to close the chapter on violence and make the province a crime-free area.
