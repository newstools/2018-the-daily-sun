Three police officers have been arrested for alleged corruption and armed robbery, the Hawks in Limpopo said on Friday. The officers who were stationed at Bela-Bela police station attempted to solicit a bribe from a complainant. "The officers allegedly robbed a complainant of about R190 000 at gunpoint on 7 September 2018 after they escorted him from a local gambling facility and demanded that he pay them a bribe in order for them not to pursue money laundering charges against him," Hawks regional spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said in a statement. The three officers were traced after the incident was reported to the Hawks' Serious Corruption Investigation Unit. The suspects, aged between 33 and 39, are expected to make an appearance at the Bela-Bela Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/3-police-officers-arrested-for-alleged-corruption-armed-robbery-20180921
