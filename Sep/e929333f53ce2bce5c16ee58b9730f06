COPS are looking for Vumelani Basi (37) in connection with a rape case. According to the Joburg East family, child and sexual violence unit, the rape happened last March. Vumelani, who’s also known as Jeqe, allegedly raped and threatened to kill a woman in Denver, Joburg. He’s believed to have been staying at Denver Hostel but is originally from Mahlabathini in KZN. Captain Richard Munyai said the case was immediately reported to the Cleveland cop shop and Vumelani was arrested on the same day. He was granted bail after he appeared in court. His next court appearance was postponed to October but he failed to appear in court. “He has since disappeared without a trace and a warrant for his arrest has been issued,” said Munyai. The police are appealing to anyone who might know his whereabouts to contact the investigating officer, Detective Simfumene Ntondini, on 078 524 3333 or 011 407 1600. The police are also pleading with SunReaders to help them with information that could help them find Sinqobile Ndlovu (17), who’s missing. Captain Xoli Mbele said Sinqobile is Zimbabwean. She came to Joburg for the first time on 19 August and her family hasn’t heard from her since. At the time of her disappearance, she was wearing a green T-shirt, grey jacket, black jeans and black takkies. She was carrying a big black suitcase and a black handbag. Anyone with information is urged to contact Detective- Sergeant Tshepo Lekhoane of the family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit on 079 491 3205 or 011 407 1600.
