THEY were the first to live in South Africa. The Khoisan ancestors left behind rock art to document their way of life, and the unique clicks in their language were adopted by African migrants who settled in the country. Now Khoisan leaders say they want their share of the land. On Heritage Day, Khoisan leaders said they were tired of being overlooked during discussions on land reform. Chief Cornelius Botha from Eersterust in Tshwane said the Khoisan wanted to claim their land fairly. “The Khoisan are still experiencing the colonialism that Europeans brought to Africa. “We are still facing oppression from our government,” said Botha. “Black traditional leaders and their communities are benefiting from land reform and have received recognition, yet the Khoisan are discriminated against.” Botha accused the government of looting from them and said the land also belonged to the Khoisan. “Our heritage is the foundation of our culture and beliefs. “How can we celebrate Heritage Day when our community’s inheritance is disrespected and denied? “How can we celebrate heritage when our chiefs are not recognised?” Botha called on government to speed up the process of recognising traditional Khoisan leaders.
