TWO well-known thugs’ reign of fear came to a sudden end in Cape Town on Friday. The two chose to rob the wrong person on Friday afternoon. Both were shot and killed after trying to rob a resident with their toy guns. Residents from the area near the bridge between Mandalay and Lower Crossroads, where the two used to operate, were shocked when they found out the thugs only had toy guns. One resident said: “The two have been robbing people of their hard-earned cash. “My friend was robbed by these two thugs but didn’t know the guns they were using were toys.” Not only the residents are happy about the thugs’ deaths. So are the Avanza taxi drivers in the area. Taxi driver Simphiwe Tayitayi (37) said they have been struggling to get passengers from Mandalay because they were being robbed. “Whoever killed them did a great job for us. “I wish others would also follow because they weren’t the only ones terrorising people.” Residents at the scene praised the person who had shot the thugs, saying they had been living in fear of their lives. “That person did us a huge favour. “It wasn’t safe to cross the bridge because of them,” said one resident. Another resident said they hoped the death of the two thugs would serve as a lesson to others. “This should be an eye-opener for other thugs. “Imagine giving your hard-earned cash, cellphone or ring to someone using a toy gun. “They were tricking people. “It’s a good thing they died,” said the resident. Zimbini Mthakatha (36) said they couldn’t walk to Gugulethu Mall because of the two thugs. “We had to hire cars to go to other kasis. “The bridge was too dangerous to cross because of them,” Zimbini said. At the scene, cops confirmed the guns found next to the dead men’s bodies were toys. Western Cape police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said the circumstances surrounding the death of the two men were being investigated. “They were shot and killed at 5.15pm by unknown suspects who are yet to be arrested,” Traut said.
