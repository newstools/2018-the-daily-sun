IT’S a precious natural wonder where animals find refuge. But villagers in Dukuduku and Mtubatuba, northern KZN, said yesterday it’s not worth anything to them. They marched to the iSimangaliso Wetland Park offices and demanded to mine sand in the area. This came after park management objected to an application by local chiefs to mine sand. Smanga Gumede (27), a young graduate who was part of the protest, told the People’s Paper: “We don’t know why they don’t want mining in this area. The park doesn’t benefit us in any way.” Smanga studied chemical engineering at the Emfolozi FET college. March leader Zwelenkosi Mthethwa (27) said the park had been in existence for years yet never benefited them. Park area manager Mumsy Khumalo said senior managers were away and she couldn’t accept the villagers’ memorandum of demands. But the villagers insisted they wanted top management to accept the memorandum.
