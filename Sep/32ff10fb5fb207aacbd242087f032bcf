TV personality Minnie Dlamini-Jones and her husband Quinton Jones are currently having a ball in Disneyland Paris, France. The couple have been in France for a couple days now and they appear to making the most out of their trip. They celebrated their first wedding anniversary in the city of love, Paris a few days ago. Before making their way to the French Capital, the pair spent some time in the Champagne crazy city of Reims, where Minnie even got to hang out in zero gravity with Olympic legend Usain Bolt.
