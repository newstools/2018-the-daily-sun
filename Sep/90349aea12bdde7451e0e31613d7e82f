RESIDENTS have vowed to continue building shacks on an empty piece of land, even though a human skeleton was found there on Tuesday. The skeleton was found in Cato Crest, Durban. Leggings, pink shoes and a purple bra were strewn near the bones. A resident said the person who found the skeleton didn’t return to the piece of land the next day. “I think he’s still in shock because he didn’t come back on Wednesday,” he said. “After he made the gruesome discovery, he said he didn’t see himself coming back to erect a shack here.” The resident said they were desperate for shelter. “Most of us have been renting rooms in the area for a very long time and we’re now tired,” he said. “When we spotted this land, we started clearing it to build shacks.” Another resident said they suspected the skeleton belonged to someone who had been robbed by thugs. “We’re not far from the bushes, and we often hear women screaming at night.” She said whoonga addicts hid in the bushes when residents hunted them. But she said they would continue building their shacks. “We’re hopeful that once we start erecting shacks, there will be fewer thugs as there will be no hiding place for them,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said an inquest docket was opened at Cato Manor cop shop. “Human remains were allegedly found in the bushes in Cato Crest on Tuesday,” she said. “Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.”
