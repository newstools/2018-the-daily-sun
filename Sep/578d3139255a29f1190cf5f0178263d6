SASSA said it is ready for next month’s social grants payment cycle. This move will see Sassa make all grant payments to beneficiaries by itself, in partnership with the South African Post Office. Cash Paymaster Services, which is a Net1 subsidiary, is currently responsible for paying less than 10%. Its contract ends at the end of the month. Sassa spokesman Paseka Letsatsi said: “In phasing out CPS at the end of the month, Sassa will be in full compliance with directions of the constitutional court. “There will be no need to ask for another extension contrary to what sceptics wrongfully predicted.” He said with only 18 days to go before the payment cycle is concluded, Sassa has already paid over R6 billion to 92% of its beneficiaries this month. He said beneficiaries should obtain the new Sassa cards now because the old ones will expire.
