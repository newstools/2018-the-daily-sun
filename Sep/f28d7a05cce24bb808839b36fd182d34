VILLAGERS are still in shock following the gruesome murders of three family members on Friday night. The bodies of the man, woman and child were found inside their shop at Sirhosheni in Nqabane Village, Eastern Cape. According to headman Kufakwakhe Sotsayi, the Somali trader (49) lived with a woman (40) from Cofimvaba and their eight-year-old daughter. “On Saturday, a young man was sent from the shop to call me,” Kufakwakhe told the People’s Paper. “When I got there I was told the man and woman had been found dead and their child had been found under a table. “The man was tied with a chain to the counter. The woman was also found inside the house.” He said the three seemingly died a painful death. Police spokesman Captain Jackson Manatha said: “It looked like they were attacked with a bush knife. “It’s not clear at this point how the community members found out about the murders.” He said the motive was unknown and the identities of the victims would be released once their next of kin had been informed. Dutywa police have appealed to anyone with information about the murders to contact them on 047 489 1333, or to phone Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
