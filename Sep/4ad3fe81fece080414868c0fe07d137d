Mzansi is divided over Cassper Nyovest's announcement that he intents to sue Tsonga music star Benny Mayengani for using the phrase Fill-up. Nyovest said that he had registered #Fill-up as his trademark last year. MayenganiÂ hosted a #FillUpGiyaniStadium in Limpopo last weekend and Nyovest wants to sue him because he did not ask for permission to use the phrase. Now Mzansi is divided on the issue. First to enter the fray was EFF leader Julius Malema who said Cassper Nyovest was being a bully. Malema also said they will bring their best lawyers to defend Mayengani in court. The EFF also released a statement condemning "with disgust the lousy and absolutely greedy move by Hip Hip musician Refiloe Phoolo aka Cassper Nyovest to sue Mayengani for using the words fill-up." "The EFF said it would be as ridiculous as anyone trying to trademark the words gusheshe, kuzazoba lit or phumakim ...all those words are concepts of everyday use in culture that should never be commercialized," read the statement.
