FATHER Ben Botha Mazwi and his wife, Nowethu, loved each other so much, not even death could separate them. The 78-year-old Queenstown district apostle of the Twelve Apostles Church of Christ, his wife Nowethu (70) and five others died in a tragic accident on the R61 near Cofimvaba a week ago. They were buried at their home in Cofimvaba on Friday, and the service was attended by members of the church from across the country. Mourners included former public works MEC Thandiswa Marawu and Chris Hani District Municipality mayor Kholiswa Vimbayo. The couple died when the Toyota Tazz they were travelling in crashed into a Toyota Hilux as they were returning from a church service in Mthatha. Bulelwa, the oldest of the couple’s eight children, said: “Our parents served God and the community all their lives. “They raised us and our children with love and taught us to fear God and live an honest life. “We will always love and miss them.” Mayor Vimbayo praised Father Mazwi for his contributions to the local government and community at large. Some of the victims of the accident will be laid to rest in Mahlubini Village in Cofimvaba next weekend. The others, including the driver of the Tazz, will be buried in Fourty Vilage in Tsomo.
