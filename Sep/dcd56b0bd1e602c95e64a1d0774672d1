RESIDENTS were overjoyed when a local farmer announced he had free meat for them. The people of Hostel 1 in Mangaung swarmed to the scene with knives and pangas on Saturday after they heard a cow had been hit by a car. Most people believe when an animal dies in this way it needs to be buried but for these residents it was like Christmas had come early. Mncedisi Shosha, one of the happy residents, told Daily Sun: “I was with friends at home and was worrying about what I was going to cook when a man came driving up to us in a bakkie. “A cow was loaded on to the back of the bakkie and he told us to go and fetch our knives. At first, I thought he was just joking. “Then I realised that people were coming in their numbers, and my friends and I went to the kitchen to fetch pangas and knives. My fridge is now full of meat and it will last for the entire month. “We were told the cow was hit by a car while trying to cross the road.” When the SunTeam arrived on the scene, residents were standing in line to cut meat from the animal. However, not everyone was keen on the offer. While some were singing in celebration, others said they would never eat meat from a cow without knowing exactly where it was from.
