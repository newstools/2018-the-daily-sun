“I DON’T think I will forget the person who shot me. I still get flashbacks of what happend that day.” These were the words of Bongani Ngwenya, who was shot during last week’s looting chaos in White City, Soweto. He was speaking during the ANC’s Thuma Mina campaign in the area yesterday by the party’s regional leadership and head of elections, Fikile Mbalula. Bongani said he was shot while delivering a message to his aunt. “While I was crossing the street, a Somali got out of his Toyota Quantum and fired three shots. One of them hit me,” he said. The ANC was in White City to deal with allegations that spaza shops were selling fong kong and expired goods. They visited five families affected by the violence and met foreign shopkeepers. Speaking to the shop owners, Mbalula said: “Those who are not compliant must close down. There must not be any negotiations about manga manga business.” Addressing residents, he said: “You can’t loot the shop where you claim the goods are fake. You are looting poison.”
