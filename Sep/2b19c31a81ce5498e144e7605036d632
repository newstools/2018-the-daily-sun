Mosetlhe Makwati believes there is no excuse for not paying papgeld. The 35-year-old from Orlando East, Soweto, is well known as Moss, the presenter of No Excuses: Pay Your Papgeld on Moja Love. He’s always seen chasing after fathers who don’t pay papgeld. Moss said in most cases mothers come to him. “I listen to both sides of the story in order to find amicable solutions for the sake of the children,” said Moss. “I love kids and I care about their well-being,” said the father of two girls aged five and eight. Moss told Daily Sun the show should have had a woman presenter but he was chosen. “I was already working for Moja Love as a researcher when I heard about auditions for the show’s presenter. I was the last to audition,” he said. “The producers were looking for someone who won’t take sides.” Before this TV gig, Moss presented a kiddies show called Ntunjambili on SABCfor seven years. He doesn’t have formal TV training but regards presenting as a calling. “I have a God-given talent. I can’t explain how I do my work. Perhaps it’s because I read a lot,” he said. “My challenge in the show is to show fathers that the show is not against them but there to look after the children’s best interests. I also encourage mothers to support fathers.” Moss said mothers must not deprive fathers of the opportunity to see and bond with their children. “I hate to see children suffering because of their parents’ differences,” said Moss. He said the craziest moment on the show was when a father chose to fix a car he crashed instead of paying papgeld. His best moment, he said, was when a father who ran from paying papgeld eventually started doing the right thing.
