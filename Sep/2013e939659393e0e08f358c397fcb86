GAUTENG Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has taken to social media to drum up support as he faces charges laid against him by Freedom Front Plus. On Monday Lesufi wrote on Facebook that the party had brought 272 charges against him for allegedly being in contempt of the country’s Constitution. But he said non-racialism was the future and no one could stop it. “I am ready to face these frivolous and time-wasting charges,” said Lesufi. Phillip van Staden, spokesman for FF Plus, said the party maintained that Lesufi had violated section 135 of the Constitution by being in contempt of section 29 of the Constitution 272 times. “Section 29 of the Constitution clearly states that everyone has the right to receive education in the official language or languages of his or her choice at public educational institutions where that education is reasonably practicable,” Van Staden said. Steve Mabona, Gauteng Education spokesman, said the MEC had received correspondence from the office of the Integrity Commissioner and the Gauteng legislature, requesting that he respond to the allegations levelled by the FF Plus. Mabona said a detailed response would be given to the Integrity Office in due course. “It was never insinuated that Afrikaans would be abolished. “This is petty politics and we do not takeit seriously. “We will never be deterred from making all our schools accessible to all our children,” Mabona said.
