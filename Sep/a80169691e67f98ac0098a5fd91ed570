KAIZER Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas is pleading with fans to be patient after his charges were booted from the MTN8 Cup in the semifinal on Saturday. Amakhosi lost 1-0 to SuperSport United in their second leg clash at FNB Stadium. The teams drew 2-2 in the first leg, meaning SuperSport won 3-2 on aggregate. Solinas was hoping to lift the Wafa Wafa trophy to ease pressure following Chiefs’ poor start to the Absa Premiership season. Amakhosi, who are winless in the league so far, have not won any silverware in more than three years. The pressure keeps mounting for Solinas, as they last won a trophy in 2014 when they bagged the MTN8. Chiefs have conceded 10 goals in seven games in all competitions this season. Despite the setback, the Italian mentor, who is aware of fans’ expectations, remains calm and insists “the best Kaizer Chiefs are coming”. Said Solinas: “Everyone wanted this final. We are disappointed to have lost this game, as we also lost an opportunity to win the trophy. “We have very important players, Lebohang Manyama and Andriamirado ‘Dax’ Andrianarimanana, still out. When Lebo is fit enough, we have a good chance of improving our offensive play. “We need to move on – this is football, we need to work hard. I’m happy with the boys but we need time. In future, with more time, we can improve and get results, I am confident. I believe in this team. “I understand our fans are not happy with the result, I’m not happy either.” Solinas said he would use the upcoming Fifa break to try out different combinations. “The break is a good opportunity, we will increase fitness and physical conditioning work. I repeat, the best Kaizer Chiefs are coming.”
