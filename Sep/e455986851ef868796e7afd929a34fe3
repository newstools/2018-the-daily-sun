THE parents of a two-month-old girl who was kidnapped last week said they are praying for the suspect to be punished for what she did. Baby Sbahle Vaphi was found alive on Monday after being kidnapped from her parents’ home in NPA squatter camp in Umzinto, on the south coast of KZN. The suspect, a 21-year-old pupil from Qwabe in Msinsini, showed cops where the child was. Sbahle’s dad Mkhalelwa Nqoloda (36) said: “We couldn’t sleep, not knowing where our daughter was. We didn’t know if she was still alive or if she had been killed.” At the end of last month, Daily Sun reported that Sbahle’s mum, Nokuphiwa Vaphi (28) was approached by the suspect, who said she had been abused by her employer and needed somewhere to sleep. Nokuphiwa gave her a place to sleep but that night, the suspect asked the mum to go to her neighbour’s house to ask for a painkiller. When she returned, the baby was gone. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “The suspect was arrested at school and led the police to a house in Turton where baby Vaphi was found.” Mbele said the baby appeared to be in good health and was being bottle fed by the suspect. “The suspect is due to appear in the Umzinto Magistrates Court today on a charge of kidnapping.”
