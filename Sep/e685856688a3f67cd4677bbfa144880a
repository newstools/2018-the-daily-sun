THE gloom finally lifted for Mamelodi Sundowns as they edged Golden Arrows 1-0 in their league encounter at Princess Magogo Stadium last night. However, the win, courtesy of Lebohang Maboe, was their first in seven matches in all competitions, including the Caf Champions League and the MTN8 Cup. Luck seemed to have deserted the Brazilians as they crashed out of two competitions in a week. But they are now fifth in the league with nine points, following a hard-fought win. In Clinton Larsen’s words, Arrows had to be at their absolute best if they hoped to beat Sundowns. But they weren’t at their best in the first half, in which they created no more than three scoring chances. They had a better possession of the ball, but that counted for less as Sundowns found the lead just before interval. Maboe coolly finished off after Sibusiso Vilakazi fumbled a pass from Tebogo Langerman trying to turn outside the box. But they came back an improved side after the halftime pep talk as they continued where they left off. Yet it takes some effort to dismantle Sundowns, even as they don’t look a ruthless force they were last season. Finding the right combinations upfront remains Pitso Mosimane’s biggest headache, though some chemistry seems to be developing between Toni Silva and Phakamani Mahlambi. The two missed gilt-edged chances as the likes of Knox Mutizwa and Danny Phiri struggled to get going on the other end. Abafana Bes’thende are 12th on the log with five, following back to back league defeats.
