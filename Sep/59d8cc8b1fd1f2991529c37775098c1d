A man believed to be 25-years-old, was left critically
injured after he was allegedly soaked with petrol and set alight in Ashburton,
KwaZulu Natal. According to ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring, paramedics
were called to the scene after a passing motorist, drove past the man and
immediately called the local authorities. “Upon arrival, paramedics found that the man had sustained
serious burns over most of his body, leaving him in a critical condition,”
Meiring said. Meiring added that the man was treated for his injuries and was
provided with advanced life support interventions, before he was transported to
a nearby hospital. “The patient later told paramedics that he was mugged,
doused in petrol and set alight. Fortunately, the man was apparently able to
extinguish himself,” Meiring said. Local authorities were on the scene for further
investigations.
