THE family of a six-month pregnant nurse whose body was found thrown down a cliff will only get closure once her killers are bust. The body of Nelisa Cele (31) was found halfway down Oribi Gorge in Port Shepstone, KZN, by a tourist on Friday. She had been working at Gamalakhe Community Healthcare Centre since 2011. She was last seen last Wednesday when she left home to collect a new car. Her stepmum Babongile Cele (60) said: “There were no threats that we knew of. That’s why we’re shocked by her death. “We’re praying the cops arrest her killers so they can say why they killed her.” She said the family thanked God for sending the tourist so Nelisiwe’s body could be found and be given a dignified burial. Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo said: “The murder of healthcare workers is always sad for us. “These are people tasked with saving lives and healing those who’re sick. “We send our deepest condolences to the family at this difficult time. “We urge anyone who might have information regarding the murder to come forward and alert the cops.” The department said Cele’s memorial service will be held today at the Methodist Church near the healthcare centre. She will be buried on Saturday. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a murder case was opened at Paddock cop shop.
