WHILE other residents are placed in transit camps for a specified period of time, residents from Siyathuthuka transit camp in Kenville have no idea when they will leave the place. These 250 residents told Daily Sun they were placed in transit camps by their previous councillor in 2013. One of the residents, Veronica Ngidi (44), said they have been waiting for a very long time without any explanation. “When you are sent to a transit camp, you become hopeful that soon you will get a proper house but with us, it’s different. “We are waiting for something that we know nothing about,” said Veronica. Another resident, Nokubonga Mzobe (44) said the terrible thing about staying in the camp was that they were not safe. “We don’t have proper electricity. People die here every now and again because they step on live electric wires,” said Nokubonga. She said the last incident happened in December when a man stumbled on uncovered live electric wires. She said things become even worse when it rains. “On rainy days even old people, who are more careful, slip and when that happens it’s hard to avoid falling on live wires,” said Nokubonga. Councillor Phindile Ndlela said: “We are working on the process of removing these people to the areas where they will get new RDP houses. “To avoid conflicts we will not disclose at the moment where and when they will be moved.” EThekwini head of housing, Mondli Mthembu, said: “Most of the people placed in transit camps without being given specific details on where and when they would be allocated houses are those who were moved before the World Cup. “The plan was that they were going to be linked to housing projects that were still to be implemented. “I will have to check with the senior manager in the north region regarding those residents in Siyathuthuka transit camp.”
