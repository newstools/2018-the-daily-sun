WHEN Gogo Leah Mabetoa turned 100, all her grandkids wanted was to make her birthday special. On Saturday, the gogo celebrated her birthday at her home in Ga-Rapadi, outside Steiloop, Limpopo. Gogo Leah, who has three sons and three daughters, said she was grateful her children showed their appreciation while she was still alive. “I’m thankful to God for giving me a long life,” said gogo Leah. “Some gogos hoped to live to 100 but that didn’t happen. “I’m still healthy and I can walk with the aid of a stick. “When I was younger I used to eat sorghum porridge with milk.” Gogo Leah said after her husband died in the 60s, she didn’t pursue another romantic partner and focused on raising her children. “Being a single parent is difficult because your children depend on you for everything. “But I’m happy my kids are taking care of me now.” Grandkid Lydia Mabetoa (43) said she and her siblings saved money to throw a party for the gogo. She said: “Our gogo made it to 100, and that is a big deal for us. “We are responsible parents because of her. “This party is our way of thanking her for being with us.” Magdalene Mabetoa (64), one of the gogo’s daughters, said the family appreciated what the grandkids did. “My mum struggled a lot. “She worked on farms so we could have something to eat. “It’s her special day, and we just wanted her to enjoy it.” Community leader Paul Matlou said he wasn’t surprised gogo Leah had turned 100 because she looked after herself she was younger. “She’s a very kind and loving person who always looked after her children,” he said. “She respected herself even after her husband’s death.”
