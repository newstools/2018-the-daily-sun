An official of the
City of Joburg has been suspended following a racial incident at a public
swimming pool! According to City
Mayor Herman Mashaba, the incident took place at the Eldorado Park swimming
pool in Joburg, last week. The official was
allegedly verbally insulting one of the pool’s security guards. The official was
reportedly overheard regretting the use of school facilities in Eldos by black
children. He also referred
insultingly to what he called “black mentality.” Mashaba said that a
case of crimen injuria will be opened on Tueday. Mashaba said that
there is no place for racism, which must be condemned and addressed decisively. “Racists must never
feel that they can operate with impunity or that their behavior is acceptable
in any circles,” he said. “I call upon the
residents of the City to condemn racism, ensure that our collective voice is
one that unites our country, overcomes the pain of our past and builds a
prosperous and more equitable future for all.”
