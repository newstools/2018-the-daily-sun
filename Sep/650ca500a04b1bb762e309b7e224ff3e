MANY Mzansi artists have died poor because they don’t understand the music business. “You can have the greatest voice but if you don’t understand how much money is generated through your craft you’re in trouble,” veteran jazz maestro, Selaelo Selota said. He told musicians and artists this at the intellectual property music awareness road show in Parkview, Joburg. The event was organised by the Gauteng Department of Economic Development and the City of Joburg. Music societies that attended the event included Samro, Sampra, Airco and Masa. Stanley Khoza from Airco, which represents independent record companies, said the majority of artists still didn’t know what the different types of royalties were. “The artists themselves don’t invest time in understanding the industry.” Francina Ntsimane from the department said black owned industry had to be protected to make sure they benefited from their creative work. She urged artists to influence legislation such as the performance protection bill which is before parliament and the copyright amendment bill. It is estimated that the music industry is worth R90 billion per year but artists aren’t benefiting.
