THE family of a mentally challenged boy who was raped on Sunday want justice. “I want the man who did this to go to jail for a very long time,” said the 14-year-old boy’s mother. “He saw my son was mentally disturbed and took advantage. I want him to be punished.” According to the 57-year-old mum from Newcastle, KZN, the suspect kidnapped her son while they were attending a neighbour’s wedding. “My son had gone with family members,” said the mum. “Knowing many people were enjoying themselves at the function, we never thought something strange could happen to him.” Later in the day the family noticed the boy had disappeared and they and villagers started looking for him. “Villagers told us they saw my boy walking with a man. We went to his house but he wouldn’t open the door. They eventually kicked it down. She said the man ran away. “When we got inside we found my son. He wasn’t wearing trousers or underwear. We took him to hospital and doctors confirmed he had been raped.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of rape was opened at Madadeni cop shop and was being investigated by the Newcastle family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit. “A 31-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with rape. He appeared in the Madadeni Magistrates Court on Tuesday.” She said court results were not available yet.
