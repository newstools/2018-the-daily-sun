DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane announced the party’s candidate for premier of the Eastern Cape yesterday. Speaking at the Athenaeum building in Port Elizabeth yesterday, Maimane said the party had chosen Nqaba Bhanga. He said the DA would address high levels of unemployment and poor academic results, among other problems. “Our people are starting to lose hope. Today I introduce Nqaba Bhanga, our Eastern Cape leader, as the premier candidate for the coming 2019 general election to bring back hope to our people,” he said. “He’s not elected to lead one race or tribe but to build a province that belongs to all South Africans.” He said the 2016 local government election results were proof that people wanted change. Bhanga said: “We have to go out and convince people about our plans. “The ANC ignored our people for two decades. Now it’s time for us to take our people forward.”
