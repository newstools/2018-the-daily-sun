SPRINGBOK coach Rassie Erasmus once said he would back Elton Jantjies even when things weren’t going well, trusting the fly-half to make the decisions, good or bad. Well, true to his word, he has picked Jantjies to start in the Rugby Championship game against Australia at Suncorp Stadium tomorrow (12pm SA time). The Lions back will start in his second Test under Erasmus, having last played against England in June. Jantjies didn’t last longer than the first half-hour in that match and came in for some stingy criticism about his performance. But Erasmus has retained faith in Jantjies, starting him ahead of Handre Pollard in the No 10 jersey for the clash with the Wallabies, which the Boks must win to stay alive in the competition. Jantjies wasn’t the only change in the team announced yesterday, Erasmus opting for a completely new-look front row, a reshuffled loose trio as well as a different midfield combination.Erasmus has also picked uncapped outside back Cheslin Kolbe on the bench, with the former Blitzbok likely to make his full Test debut.Steven Kitshoff and Bongi Mbonambi will form a new-look front row next to Frans Malherbe, with Tendai Mtawarira and Malcolm Marx set to play off the bench.“We are looking for a good response on Saturday and I am sure that this side will be up to the task,” said Erasmus.“At home, Australia will no doubt be highly motivated to bounce back, so we have to be ready for a huge contest.“We have worked hard to rectify our errors of last week and we know the set-piece and breakdown battles are going to be important.“The Wallabies are known for their abilities at the breakdown and we will have to be accurate and disciplined in those areas.”Skipper Siya Kolisi (No 6) and Pieter-Steph du Toit start at flank, with Warren Whiteley completing the loose trio at No 8. Returning centre Damian de Allende partners Jesse Kriel at centre.Aphiwe Dyantyi and Makazole Mapimpi (wings) and the experienced Willie le Roux complete the rest of the South African backline.
