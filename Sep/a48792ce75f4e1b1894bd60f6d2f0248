An 87-year-old madala was caught driving into oncoming
traffic on a highway. According to cops, they had to swerve their car out of the
way to avoid a crash with the Honda Jazz that the madala was driving. The madala reportedly pulled out of an intersection and
drove in the wrong direction to enter the A3 highway in Surrey, England. Following that he failed a roadside eyesight test. He allegedly could only read a number plate from a distance
of 7.3 metres. The requirement in that state is that a driver should be
able to read a number plate at least 20.5 metres away.
