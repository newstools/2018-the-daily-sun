A FAMILY from KwaNdaya, Esikhaleni in northern KZN was left homeless after a fire destroyed their house on Saturday. The family of three said they were sleeping and eating at their neighbours’ houses because the fire left them with nothing. Mzwandile Mathaba (32) said he and his two sisters were watching TV in the dining-room when they suddenly saw smoke coming from one of the bedrooms. “We went to check and saw huge flames in one of the bedrooms. “We tried to take a few things out but the flames were so big and moving fast. We ran outside and left our belongings in the house,” Mzwandile told Daily Sun. He said they didn’t know what started the fire. “There were no electrical faults in the house. “The fire destroyed everything, including our furniture and important documents.” Mzwandile said they were appealing to anyone who could help them rebuild their house. “We need all the help we can get as no one is working in the family. “We would be glad if Good Samaritans could help us with clothes and food,” said Mzwandile. Councillor Hamilton Ncanana has appealed to anyone who could help the family. “Please donate things like beds, clothes, food parcels and building material because the family was left with nothing. I am also talking to local business people and the municipality to help the family,” Ncanana told the People’s Paper. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of arson was opened at Esikhaleni Police Station and cops were investigating.
