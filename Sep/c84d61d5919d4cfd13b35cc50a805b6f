SAMKELISIWE Mnguni (52) from Port Durnford, outside Esikhaleni in northern KZN, is a worried mum. Her crumbling house which she shares with her five kids and seven grandchildren leaks when it’s raining. “I’m unemployed and battling to build a bigger house for my family. I moved away from my home in 2013 because there were problems there and used the last of my savings to build this house,” she said. Samkelisiwe said when it rained they put buckets all over the floor. “We only have one bed which I share with my daughter, who is living with a disability. The rest of the kids sleep on the floor.” Samkelisiwe said they reported their problem to the councillor in June and he visited them. “The councillor promised to help me apply for an RDP. But he said it would take years before I got one. “We are appealing to Good Samaritans to help us build another room so we can live a normal life. No one is working in my family. We rely on my daughter’s disability grant.” Samkelisiwe said she also needed a wheelchair for her daughter Jabulile (23). Councillor Sipho Zulu said: “Things are bad for the family. I have referred their matter to the Sukuma Sakhe programme, but I am still waiting for a response. “Meanwhile, I am talking to local business people to assist the daughter with a wheelchair.”
