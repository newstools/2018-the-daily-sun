A SPECIAL needs pupil who was allegedly strangled last week was also a rape victim. Aphiwe Msexy (10), a pupil at Vukuzenzele Special School in Bizana, Eastern Cape was found dead in a school bus. He used to live at boarding school, but his gogo removed him after he allegedly told her he had been raped. Zukiswa Msexy (44) said: “I was called to the school because Aphiwe had been crying a lot. “The teachers accused him of not wanting to learn. “He showed me with his hands what they were doing to him.” Zukiswa said she reported the matter to the school. “They did not believe me. “Only the principal assisted me with the case. “I took all his belongings from the school and he had to take the bus to school every day. “I am very suspicious of the details surrounding his death. “I still think it is connected to the rape case, even though that happened last year. “They are telling me he was found on the back seat. “Why did the driver leave disabled kids alone?” she asked. Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima confirmed the rape case. “A case of rape was reported to the department last year.” “An investigation is continuing and the suspected culprits were sent to juvenile institutions,” Mtima said.
