THE body of a 29-year-old woman was discovered after she allegedly had an argument with her boyfriend. It was found in Khayelitsha kasi, Mangaung on Sunday morning. The woman, who is believed to be from Brandfort, Free State, was allegedly beaten to death and her body dumped in the back of a shack. Her alleged boyfriend committed suicide at the Loch Logan Waterfront Mall on Thursday. According to a source, the woman allegedly visited her boyfriend and was supposed to return home last weekend. But she couldn’t be reached on her cellphone last Monday. The couple allegedly had an argument and the woman was beaten to death. A resident who discovered the body said: “I was coming back from a spaza shop when I saw a woman lying face down with flies around her. “When I went closer I realised she was dead. “I then alerted the neighbours. “I was told by other residents that the woman was not from around there and was visiting her boyfriend for a week. We heard noises that sounded like people arguing coming from the shack near where the woman was found. “I believe she might have been beaten to death.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi told Daily Sun: “We are investigating a case of murder after the body of a 29-year-old woman was found outside a shack. “No suspects have been arrested yet. The man whose body was found at a mall can’t be linked with the woman’s death at this stage. “Investigations are continuing.”
