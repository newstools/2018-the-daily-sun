THE honeymoon is certainly over for Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus as he faces a tricky tour of Australasia. The Boks landed in Australia yesterday ahead of their third Rugby Championship match at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane on Saturday, before they travel to New Zealand a week later. And while Brisbane is known to be an idyllic honeymoon destination in Queensland, it is, however, no place or time for relaxation for Erasmus. The Boks are under pressure to bounce back from an embarrassing 32-19 defeat to Argentina, which may well have ended their hopes of winning the championship. And no one feels the pressure more keenly than Erasmus. “Whenever you lose there is pressure and we are feeling the pressure,” he admits. “The moment we start thinking people shouldn’t be unhappy when we lose to a team like Argentina, we shouldn’t be here. That’s something we must cherish. If people are upset and sad when you lose, it shows they still care. “We are hurting and I can stand here and say pretty words, but it wouldn’t really help. The only thing that matters is what happens on Saturday.” Smarting from two back-to-back losses to the All Blacks, the Wallabies will be in a mean mood against the Boks. The fact that Michael Cheika’s men will be desperate for victory at home won’t make it any easier for South Africa. And Erasmus is under no illusion about the task he faces. He said: “They are maybe in an even worse position than us. In the two games they had, they played the world champions and were given a proper hiding. “They will be desperate and that will make them dangerous. We are also desperate and we lost to a team that we didn’t want to lose to. “It’ll be two teams trying their best to rectify the previous week’s mistakes. We’re ready and up for the challenge. The only way we’re going to get last week out of our minds is by winning.”
