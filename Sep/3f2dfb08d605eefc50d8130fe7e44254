THE death toll from an earthquake and tsunami in Sulawesi rose to 832 on Sunday. Dozens of people were reported to be trapped under rubble in the city of Palu, which was hit by waves as high as 6 metres following Friday’s 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Hundreds had gathered for a festival on the city’s beach when the wall of water reached the shores, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in its path. President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in the city on Sunday. National Disaster Management Agency head Willem Rampangilei said: “It’s estimated that 10 000 refugees are scattered in 50 points in Palu city. “We are having a hard time deploying heavy equipment to find victims under the rubble of buildings because many of the roads leading to Palu are damaged,” he said. Amateur footage showed waves crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding a mosque. Dozens of injured people were being treated in makeshift medical tents set up outdoors. Photos showed bodies being lined up along the street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered with clothes. Agency spokesman Sutopo Nugroho said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels had collapsed. “The tsunami dragged cars, logs and houses. It hit everything on land,” said Nugroho. The Red Cross said employees and volunteers were heading to the affected areas. “We are getting limited communication about the destruction in Palu, but we’ve heard nothing from Donggala and that is extremely worrying. “There are more than 300 000 people living there,” said the organisation. – REUTERS
