TWO siblings, aged 8 and 11, were reported missing on Sunday afternoon. Much later, their parents were devastated when the girls were found dead in the boot of their father’s old car. The sisters, Inathi Bokwe (8) and Asonele Bokwe (11), loved to play in the old Peugeot 406 sedan. Daily Sun could not reach either parents as the mother Kholiswa Bokwe (32) was admitted to hospital and the father, Joseph Nyamankulu (59), was busy at the children’s school. Neighbour Nowethe Nkhethe (66) from extension 19 in Bronville, Welkom, said the father must get rid of the car. She said: “We all searched for the children. “Their father even went to look for them at the nearby dam and at the toilets. “He later checked the boot of his car and we were shocked to realise they died in the vehicle.” Police spokesman Captain Malebo Khosana said the police did not suspect any foul play. “Two sisters were found dead in the boot of their father’s car. “At about 5.30pm, their mum started looking for them after she returned from a traditional ceremony at a neighbour’s house. “She got worried and called their father, who was at work at the time. “The couple, together with neighbours, friends and relatives, searched for the siblings. Police were later called to assist,” said Khosana. “When we arrived at the siblings’ home to open a missing person case, we discovered that both girls were in the boot of their father’s car.” The police said a post mortem would determine the cause of their death.
