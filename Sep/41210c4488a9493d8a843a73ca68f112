TEACHING resumed at Umthala Junior Primary School on Monday. The school in KwaNdengezi, near Durban, was closed on Friday after several pupils became sick from eating allegedly poisoned chocolate on Thursday. Parent Mdlova Nxumalo told Daily Sun 30 pupils were rushed to hospital while hundreds of others were attended to by nurses at the school. “We got worried when we heard hundreds of pupils were suffering from the same condition after they ate the chocolate,” he said. Mdlova said pupils started scratching themselves, which made the teachers worried. When the teachers questioned the pupils, they said they had bought chocolate from a hawker. “A special meeting was called on Friday after the incident, and parents agreed the hawker should stop selling her stock on school premises.” KZN Education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said: “We take these allegations seriously, but we’ll have to get a report from the district office and act accordingly.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the incident was reported to the police, but no criminal case was opened. “Pupils were taken for medical attention after they started feeling itchy. An inquiry was opened to investigate the origin of what the victims consumed. No one has been arrested,” she said.
