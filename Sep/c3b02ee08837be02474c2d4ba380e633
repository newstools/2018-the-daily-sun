THE SACP in KZN has suspended treasurer Mbuyiseni Mathonsi. This was announced by the newly elected provincial leadership in Durban on Wednesday. Secretary Themba Mthembu said one of the resolutions taken at the conference held from Sunday to Tuesday was to approve recommendations by the party’s disciplinary committee, which said Mathonsi should be suspended for 10 years. He said Mathonsi insulted and undermined the leadership, but the former treasurer denied the allegations. Mathonsi said he was suspended because Mthembu didn’t want to be challenged. Mathonsi said: “I was not present at the disciplinary hearing. I have already appealed the decision.” Mathonsi was replaced by Nomarashiya Caluza.
