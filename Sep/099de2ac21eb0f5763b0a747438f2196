THE first day of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme
(NSFAS) online applications for 2019, ran without problems. By 10 in the morning well over 400 new applications have
successfully been submitted. According to NSFAS, more than 8 000 users have already
visited the NSFAS website to learn more about the application step. “Applications will close on 30 November 2018,” NSFAS
Administrator Dr Randall Carolissen said. Carolissen said new students and returning students without
NSFAS registration should apply online at www.nsfas.org.za immediately and not
procrastinate. The application requirements are a copy of ID for the applicant
and parents, a payslip of both parents, if parents earn an income, and a
consent form to give the scheme permission to verify income. Students whose parents are not working are only required to
submit a signed consent form. “Continuing students who are funded by NSFAS this year, will
be contacted by NSFAS to sign their agreements online, if they have not done so
already. They are not required to reapply as funding will automatically
continue in 2019, if they meet the progression rule of 50% pass. “From 17 September 2018, applicants can also submit their
paper applications at the nearest National Youth Development Agency offices
across the country, where they will be assisted by a NSFAS official to capture
the application,” Carolissen explained. Carolissen added that public universities and Technical
Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges, will also be capacitated to
assist with both online and paper application forms at the Financial Aid
Office.
