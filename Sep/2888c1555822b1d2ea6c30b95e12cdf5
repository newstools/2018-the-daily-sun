GROWING up, Thabang Sekokotoane watched his mum making dresses at home. And today, the 22-year-old from Botshabelo section F in Mangaung, Free State, has his own fashion design business. Thabang told Daily Sun he planned to give back to his community this year by donating dresses to three matric pupils for their end of year dance. Thabang completed matric at Leratong High School in 2013 and went to university. But after realising he was passionate about fashion, he dropped out to help his mum with her sewing business. He later branched out on his own and his business has grown by leaps and gowns. Thabang designs clothes for people of different ages. He employs two people permanently. Thabang said after his father’s death, his mum was forced to use her hands to feed her six children. “I realised my mum needed help as she worked 18 hours almost every day to finish work for clients, some as far away as Gauteng,” he said. He went to study education at the Central University of Technology in Bloemfontein in 2015 but he couldn’t focus on his studies as he missed being behind his mum’s sewing machine. Thabang has been running his business at Botshabelo Industrial Area for almost two years . “This year, I will sponsor three matric pupils at different high schools. I will choose those who are hard workers and come from disadvantaged families.”
