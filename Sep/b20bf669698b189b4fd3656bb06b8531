One thing you can’t take away from South Africans is that we love listening to music and having a good time. With the festive season just around the corner, good music is bound to be the order of the day. One event that promises to deliver good music is the Sodwana Bay Bush Festival, which will take place at Drie Doring farm in KZN on 15 December 2018. Musicians Sjava, Sho Madjozi, Tipcee, Zola, Professor, Khuzani and DJs Lerato Kganyago, Mobi Dixon, and Cndo are billed to entertain the crowd. Professor said: “I’m excited about the upcoming show. “During my set I’ll focus on performing good music.” The kwaito musician’s single Brand New is the talk of town, and he said he was happy with the reception it has been receiving. “I don’t want to draw a line when it comes to the type of music I make. “I’m always open to broadening my sound,” he said. Festival producer Fungayi Kanyuchi said: “This is the perfect excuse to take a sho’t left. “This part of KZN boasts protected beaches, lakes and game reserves with the Big 5. “There’s lots to see and discover before or after the festival, so come party and experience something new.” The festival hopes to encourage holidaymakers to explore the range of tourist attractions in Sodwana Bay and Hluhluwe. ) Tickets are available at Computicket.
