A SCHOOL boy was caned so badly by his teacher that he
died several days later from his injuries. According to the Guardian, Sperius Eradius (13) from Kagera
province, northern Tanzania was accused of stealing from another teacher at the
school. He died on 27 August, a few days after his punishment. Corporal punishment is legal in Tanzania. It is supposed
to be limited to a maximum of four klaps with a flexible cane, but teachers
generally ignore the rules and moer kids as they please. Sperius’ death has caused an outcry from human rights
activists. Sonia Vohito, Africa project coordinator for the Global
Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of children, told the Guardian: “We
cannot wait. [Children] have human rights. We cannot wait for them to die to
change things. “We need political willingness. The authorities have to
take the lead.” Human Rights Watch has found Tanzanian schools to be
hotbeds of violence and sexual harassment against kids, with girls being
particularly vulnerable.
