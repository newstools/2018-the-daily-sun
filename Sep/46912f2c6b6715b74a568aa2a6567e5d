WHILE motorists are still celebrating the fact that the government absorbed the last petrol increase, news has broken that more pain is in store. Motorists should prepare themselves for a steep hike next month. It looks as if the petrol price will go up by more than R1 a litre. The Central Energy Fund has said a weak rand and high international oil prices have contributed to the hefty increase. After the last fuel hike, MPs said the government should relax taxes and levies on petrol to give motorists a break. But Energy Minister Jeff Radebe said their hands were tied due to the international oil price. Last month, Radebe intervened to cap this monthâ€™s increase at 5c rather than the expected hike of between 25c and 28c. This move reportedly cost the government about R500 million. Besides taxes and levies, a lot of factors affect the fuel price. These include the exchange rate against the dollar and international oil prices. Locally, the price is affected by transport costs and money directed towards the Road Accident Fund. After the last increase, the government promised to report back to parliament after this month on what it planned to do to ease the burden.
