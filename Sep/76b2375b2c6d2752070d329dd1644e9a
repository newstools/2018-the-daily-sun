A 10-year-old girl who went missing in Etwatwa, near Daveyton in Ekurhuleni on Wednesday was found dead. Her killers dropped off her body at a soccer field in the area. Cops had searched for her until Thursday night. A pedestrian discovered her body in the early hours of Friday morning. She had been mutilated. Etwatwa cops spokesman Captain Ramothaki Maqabe said the girlâ€™s attackers cut off her legs off at the knees. The legs were also missing from the scene and cops suspect the murder could be muthi related. There are also reports that she was raped but Maqabe said forensics are still investigating.
