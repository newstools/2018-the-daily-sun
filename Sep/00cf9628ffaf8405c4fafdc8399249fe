SEVERAL shops in Giyani, Limpopo were found to be selling rotten and expired food on Monday. This was after environmental health inspectors and Mopani mayor Nkakareng Rakgoale pounced on local shops which were reported to be selling unhealthy food. Rakgoale said she was shocked and disappointed by the behaviour of shop owners who were putting the lives of community members in danger. “We have heard that some shops were selling expired food, while others give them away to churches to hand over to the needy. “Poor people don’t deserve rotten food. We want all shops to follow retail laws for the sake of our communities.” . She said the rotten and expired food was removed from the shelves and would be disposed of. Rakgoale emphasised that the operation followed a public outcry sparked by a video of expired groceries making the rounds on social media. The mayor added that she was also unhappy with the conditions of some shops. “We took all the items with us because we cannot trust that they will remove them after being told to do so. There is now a national directive that environmental health practitioners must embark on inspection blitzes with their respective municipalities. “The operation is targeting all shops owned by local and foreigners. The safety of our people is a priority,” said Rakgoale.
