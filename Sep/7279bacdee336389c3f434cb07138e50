PASTOR Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng has had enough of being attacked and called names! Yesterday Mboro said he opened a case of crimen injuria, intimidation and defamation of character at the Alberton Police Station against several members of a WhatsApp group known as Open Politics. He said his action was supported by Prophet Shepherd Bushiri and Pastor Keith Harrington, who are also against the insults. It is understood the WhatsApp group is made up of union leaders, politicians, celebrities and activists. Mboro said the group is managed by Ronnie McKenzie, president of Farmers United of South Africa. The people he opened cases against include student activist Mcebo Dlamini, Criselda Dudumashe and Lebo Kheswa. He said apart from being called a pervert, con man and the devil, his mum was referred to as a “pig”. Addressing members of his church outside the cop shop, Mboro said that since he had joined the group in April, he was repeatedly insulted – until he was removed from the group on Tuesday. “This group has very powerful, connected and influential people. My mother, who is 88 years old, was called a pig,” said Mboro “It is also alleged that in my church, women are instructed to take down their panties and I pray for their private parts. They said all my members are Satanists.” Responding to the allegations, the group said Mboro was seeking attention and is a media junkie. They said they were not going to entertain him. Alberton police spokesman Captain Manare Ramotshela said a case of defamation of character had been opened.
