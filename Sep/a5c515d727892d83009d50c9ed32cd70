A young boy (9) has written a book about how he survived bullying when he started school. According to Drum Lelo Mofokeng’s excitement to start school turned to misery thanks to a bully who honed in on him on the jungle gym, regularly shoving him and punching him in the stomach. He hated going to school. And then his mom stepped in. “Being bullied was painful,” he recalls. He would cry a lot but didn’t want to speak out about what was going on. “I wanted to keep it to myself so that I didn’t worry other people – I was worried about my parents’ feelings,” the young author tells DRUM at his primary school, The Ridge School in Westcliff, Johannesburg. Lelo has been writing children’s books since he was in Grade 1, mostly centred on his favourite superheroes. But How I Survived Bullying, which he started writing by hand in 2016, is his first book to be published. He finished it in a year while in Grade 1 and his mom then typed it up. “When I finished writing the book I didn’t really care about, like, publishing or anything,” Lelo says. “I thought I’d just write my feelings down, you know?” But his mom realised it could help other children and they self-published the book. It has now become a part of children’s book clubs around the country, where kids come together for a reading play date either at home or in a library and read books by young authors. Lelo and his mom have also become anti-bullying campaigners. So far 1000 books have been printed since May and over 600 have been sold. The book, which costs R150, can be ordered from his parents.
