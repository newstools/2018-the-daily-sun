PARENTS at Gqokubukhosi High School in Melmoth, northern KZN, are worried the school may soon be closed. The school has about 170 pupils from grades 8 to 12 who are taught by only four teachers. Some subjects were not taught because there were not enough teachers. Tholi Biyela (51) who has two kids at the school, said they were worried their children in grade 10 and 11 may be left stranded. “The issue has been raised many times at parents’ meeting. If this school is closed our kids will have to walk for more than an hour to the nearest school,” said Tholi. Another parent, Wilson Mdletshe (59) who has a son in matric, said he was worried because his son told him they had been without isiZulu and Life Orientation teachers for the past few weeks, after two teachers were involved in a car accident. “We fear that our kids could fail matric,” he said. SGB chairman Jabulani Zulu confirmed that the school was in a crisis. “We don’t have enough teachers and some subjects can’t be taught. Some pupils have stopped coming to school because they are not being taught,” said Zulu. “We will have a meeting on 20 September with the district manager. We hope a solution will be reached.” KZN Department of Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said they were not aware that the school faced closure. “Only the MEC and the head of department has the authority to close the school.”
