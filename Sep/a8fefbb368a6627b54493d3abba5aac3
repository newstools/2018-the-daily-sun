“I HAVE moered people in the past few days and it’s not nice because I created enemies. “But these people don’t listen!” Gatvol Johannes Tsotetsi from Diepkloof, Soweto said it was painful to live near an open space where people dump rubbish. Johannes, like many Soweto residents, is living in filth since the Pikitup services were suspended two weeks ago. Waste collection services were stopped after hostel dwellers took to the streets, demanding jobs from Pikitup. They marched to the depots and prevented workers from entering or leaving the premises. “We are living with rats and flies all over our houses. We can’t enjoy our meals anymore. I erected a fence so people can dump rubbish far from our houses, but it didn’t help. Everybody is dumping rubbish here.” The fence has collapsed under the heavy weight of the rubbish. As he spoke to Daily Sun, a neighbour was helping him to remove the piled up rubbish and take it deep into the veld. The protesters threatened to burn down all Soweto depots so everyone would be jobless. Pikitup spokesman Muzi Mkhwanazi said it was difficult to give a timeline when waste collection would resume. “It’s not workers on strike but outside job seekers,” he said. “Our workers are not safe at all. If our budget allowed us, we would employ everyone, but that is impossible,” Mkhwanazi said. He asked the job seekers to direct their concerns to the mayor, the speaker and to mayoral committee members.
