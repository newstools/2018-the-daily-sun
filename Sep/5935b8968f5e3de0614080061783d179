THIS past winter was mostly mild. But apart from a few cold flashes, plants and trees have been treating the weather like an early spring. And when flowers open, allergies explode! Ongoing studies have shown that levels of pollen are increasing, and this is terrible news for hay fever sufferers. Dr Corli Lodder of the Allergy Clinic in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, said: “Because of climate change, we have longer, warmer, more humid seasons. This is increasing allergens such as pollen and spores.” Allergy symptoms The common symptoms of an allergic reaction include sneezing, a runny, stuffy or itchy nose, coughing, a sore or scratchy throat, itchy or watery eyes, dark circles under the eyes, frequent headaches and excessive fatigue. “People allergic to pollen suffer worse in spring and early summer but can look forward to suffering through autumn and winter, thanks to warmer weather.” For more info about allergies, visit www.allergyfoundation.co.za
