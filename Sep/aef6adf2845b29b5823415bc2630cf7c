THE Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union president, Joseph Mathunjwa, has threatened the gold mining sector with a crippling strike. Speaking in Sandton, northern Joburg, yesterday, Mathunjwa said the union would be taking mining companies Sibanye Still water, Village Main Reef and Harmony to the CCMA. “We are always prepared to work with employers but once we pull the handbrake, no one will be able to lower it,” he said. “These mines are rich but they do not want to share with the workers. Their executives are earning millions.” He said if the CCMA negotiations failed, a strike would start 48 hours after a certificate of outcome was issued. Mathunjwa said a strike would affect every workplace and there would be a shutdown wherever Amcu had members. However, he said Amcu was happy with the progress of negotiations with AngloGold Ashanti which started in June. Mathunjwa said the power of Amcu had seen mineworkers in the platinum sector earning much better wages than their colleagues at gold mines. “The quest of Amcu has always been to negotiate a minimum living wage of R12 500, which we believe is possible in the next three years. Unless the three come close to what AngloGold Ashanti is offering, we will go on strike. “AngloGold’s offer is more progressive, therefore we can engage on similar offers but nothing less,” he said.
