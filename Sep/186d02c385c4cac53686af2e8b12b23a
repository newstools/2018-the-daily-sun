I T WAS like a scene from reality TVwhen the poor family got a brand new home on Friday! The Kunenes were moved from their rundown shack to a relative’s RDP while Good Samaritans demolished the structure and built a new one worth R50 000. On Friday, the family were escorted to their new shack by cops and a biker group from Etwatwa. The motorcade was led by station commander, Colonel Molatelo Maoto. On arrival at the new home, they were welcomed by a guard of honour made up of community patrollers. When mum Chrisjane saw her new home,   she was overwhelmed with joy. The family of 15 from Ebumnandini in Etwatwa previously bathed, slept and ate in a one-roomed shack. When it rained, the shack would get flooded and they would become miserable. Chrisjane said: “I never thought one day angels would smile on us. I’ll sleep in a comfortable, warm bed, thanks to the Good Samaritans who came to our rescue.” Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said they decided to help the Kunenes after a community patroller told them about their horrible situation. “He came to tell us about the family and we went there to see for ourselves,’’ he said. “We decided to do something about the situation.” Maqabe said the CPF looked for sponsors and many were happy to help. “Manny’s Build It agreed to provide building material and other sponsors donated furniture,” he said. Maoto thanked the CPF, Modderbee Prison, Manny’s Build It, local Somali traders, Ithemba Rape Crisis Centre, Trustees Funeral Sevices, Maphale Funeral Services and families that donated food and clothing.
