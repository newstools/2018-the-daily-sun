A 58-year-old woman suffered severe burn wounds on her chest
and face after she dosed herself with paraffin and burnt her clothes. Reaction Unit South Africa’s spokesperson Prem Balram said according
to her family, the grandmother who had been battling depression for several
years, was found by her helper. The helper reportedly informed RUSA that she felt the two
bedroom outbuilding heat up. “She then entered the room and found the woman burning. The paraffin
was drained from two lamps that were found in the kitchen,” Balram said. Reaction Unit South Africa was called out to the home on
Thatch-manor Road in Trenance Manor – Phoenix, on Tuesday afternoon. “Upon arrival Officers found the EMRS Paramedics in
attendance. The woman was stabilized & transported to Mahatma Ghandi
Memorial Hospital in Phoenix,” Balram added.
