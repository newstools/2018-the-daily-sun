THE person who shot Bandile Makhalima wanted to make sure he was dead. The 31-year-old taxi driver was shot many times. “What it shows us is that he was shot in the back and when he turned around to look at the person who was shooting at him, he was shot again in the head,” said Bandile’s uncle, Zuko Makhalima (43). The Avanza taxi owner was killed in Lusaka, Nyanga in Cape Town on Friday. Bandile’s father Mnoneleli Koti (53) couldn’t speak. He just kept looking at his son’s body in disbelief. Bandile had owned the taxi for the past two years. Zuko said he received a call from family members telling him about the incident. “I couldn’t believe the news until I arrived at the scene. “I found Bandile lying in a pool of his blood.” He said they were told that the person who shot Bandile was travelling in a Toyota Quantum. “We think it has everything to do with the ongoing taxi violence. “We hope the law take its course because we are hurt about this,” Zuko told Daily Sun. Bandile was originally from Lower Qobonco Village in Ngcobo, Eastern Cape. His uncle described him as someone who was very active and helped where he could. “We were counting on him. Every time we had a problem Bandile was always there to help,” said Zuko. Nyanga police spokesman Brigadier Vuyisile Ncata confirmed the incident. “The case is still under investigation. No arrest has been made.”
