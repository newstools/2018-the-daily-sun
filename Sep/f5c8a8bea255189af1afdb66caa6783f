ALTHOUGH these cops have won awards for their good work, they are forced to work in an unsafe building. In October, Daily Sun first reported on the terrible conditions cops at Kwa-Thema Police Station, Ekurhuleni, work under. But absolutely nothing changed. On Thursday, the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union decided enough was enough and put police tape over the entrance to the station to prevent the public from entering. When the SunTeam arrived on the scene, people who had come to make affidavits were clearly frustrated. They said they didn’t know whether or not the station was working. They eventually found cops working in a police Quantum next to the entrance. Popcru decided to take action after Gauteng government workers were removed from nine buildings due to safety concerns. Popcru spokesman Richard Mamabolo said cops would no longer work in a building that put their lives in danger. He said the union had investigated the building and found a number of health hazards. “The building has cracks in it, some toilets were out of order and pipes had burst,” said Mamabolo. He added that a wall was damaged and the chairs in the charge office were in a terrible state. Cops said when it rained, water came leaking in through the roof and they were often forced to work while standing in water. Residents said when containers were brought to the station in March, they hoped the cops would work in better conditions. Station commander Colonel Elsie Malapane said they had reported the issue to the municipality but nothing changed. Public works department spokesman Thami Mchunu said the cops would soon move into the containers while the building was fixed.
