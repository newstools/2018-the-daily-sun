THIS bogus school was shut down! The teachers there were not qualified to teach and the principal’s bedroom was next to the classrooms! Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi closed Centauri Learning Centre in Centurion, Tshwane. Lesufi said the school was operating from a residential dwelling where effective teaching could not take place. “The school didn’t have a sufficient number of teachers. “They had three teachers, including the principal, to oversee pupils in grades 8 to 12,” said Lesufi. He added that one of the teachers didn’t have a teaching qualifications and was not registered with the South African Council for Educators. “The school disregarded assessment policies and examination procedures,” he said. Lesufi said hospitality studies was one of the subjects offered at the school, but no one was qualified to teach the subject and the school was not equipped to offer the practical component. He said the school did not follow examination regulations as teaching and the administration of examinations was done without any structure and in a chaotic manner. Lesufi said the process of placing affected pupils elsewhere should not exceed a period of 30 days after parents were informed. He said the registration of the school was withdrawn. He advised the owners to stop operating, failing which the matter would be reported to the police.
