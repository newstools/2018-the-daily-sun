THE family of Lucky Kubayi from Edinburgh, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, wants answers over their son’s brutal death. The 19-year-old was found lying dead at the gate of his lover’s house a few metres away from his home at about 5am last Monday. He was allegedly choked with a cable around his neck. Hundreds of mourners paid their last respects when he was laid to rest on Sunday. They threatened to take the law into their own hands if police dragged their feet to bring Lucky’s killers to book. Speaking at the funeral, fuming induna Eddie Malamule said Lucky’s death was an evil act by gang killers. “His killers must be brought to book. They should rot in jail,” he said. Lucky’s sister, Sihle Ndlazi (33), said her brother’s death came after he had a brawl with his lover’s new boyfriend at a music festival at Thulamahashe Stadium. “My brother had a brawl with the man and his attackers came after him. They attacked him in the presence of his lover at a local sports field in the village last Sunday. Shocked neighbours woke up in the morning saying Lucky had been murdered at his lover’s home gate,” said Sihle. She said Lucky was a brilliant boy who wanted to study police science. Sergeant Abigail Nxumalo said a 24-year-old suspect was arrested for murder and will appear in court soon.
