A DESPERATE woman who lives in a tunnel has been arrested
for allegedly possessing human body parts. It was thanks to her arrest that she dodged being hung by
furious residents, according to Punch. Folake Falade (40) told cops her sad story that saw her
living in a tunnel in Lagos, Nigeria and earning money as a magosha. She said: “I was married to an Egun man who abandoned me.
My only surviving child, Abiodun Jeriat, is with my husband. I had five other
children, but they all died. “I have been living in the place for about two months
after I could not find my house at Mosafejo Ilogbo, Ogun State. “On the day I was caught, I was sitting when a man who
offered me a gin. The second person came and asked if I had a cellphone and I
said no. “Not long after, I saw some people with canes and they
started beating me up. They also removed all the things I used to cover myself with
whenever it rains. “They asked where I used to get money to buy gin and I
told them that some men had been having sex with me and they gave me money –
N200 (about R8,30) or N300 (about R12,50).” Cops allege that when they searched her tunnel-home they
discovered rotting body parts including a skull. Falade at first admitted to having body parts in her
possession, but later claimed she had only been cutting up cowhide. She has been charged with the possession of human body
parts. Falade is out on bail and due back in court on 26
September.
