GOGO Aluoneswi Gabara of Gunda Tshilate Village, outside Thohoyandou, is one sad old lady. The 74-year-old gogo has been living without electricity while watching her neighbours benefit from the fruits of democracy. The poor gogo explained: “When a contractor was given a tender to install electricity in my village, some material was delivered to other houses except mine. A few months, the other houses were left with electricity, except mine. “And when I asked the contractor why, his response was that he couldn’t help me because I lived in a mud house. I told him I couldn’t afford to build myself a modern house because I’m poor. But he still left me with no electricity. She says she then went to the Thulamela Municipality for help, but all she got was empty promises. “They told me they were going to investigate my case, but to this day I’m still living in the dark.” “I have now turned to Daily Sun for help.” Chairperson of the Community Civic Service,Phinnias Tshifango, said: “After we learned that the contractor has failed to electrify gogo’s home. A meeting was held between the contractor, chief and local councillor. The problem was discussed and the contractor promised to attend to gogo’s problem. But to our surprise, he disappeared without a trace.”We therefore appeal to Daily Sun to help the old woman.” Phinnies said gogo was staying alone because all her children are married and stayed in the neighbouring villages.” Thulamela Municipality spokesperson Ndwamato Tshiiloa said: “The municipality is aware of gogo’s problem.She’s not the only person affected. There are three other people facing the same problem in that village. We’re working around the clock in making sure the affected people get help.”
