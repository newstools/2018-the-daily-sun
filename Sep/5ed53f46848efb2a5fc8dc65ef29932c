RESIDENTS of KwaMashu N section, north of Durban, heard a man crying out for help thursday morning, followed by gunshots. When they got to the scene it was too late – they found the body of a man in his 40s. Witnesses said the man was on his way to work when he was robbed and shot dead. A resident said he heard the cries as he was preparing to step out of his house. “I realised someone was being shot at and went out and saw a man lying on the pavement,” he said. Another resident said: “I went to my house to get a duvet cover to put over the man’s body. “He looked like he was on his way to work.” He was carrying a lunch box. Residents said the area was not safe in the mornings and evenings and a lot of people had been robbed. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala told Daily Sun a murder case was opened by Ntuzuma cops. “It’s believed a man was shot by an unknown suspect in N section,” she said. He sustained a gunshot wound to the chest and was declared dead at the scene. “The motive for the killing is unknown,” she said.
