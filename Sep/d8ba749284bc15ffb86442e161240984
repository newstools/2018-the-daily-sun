After teasing fans all week with revolutionary artwork, King Kotini, Riky Rick finally dropped his new single I Can’t Believe It today.  I Can’t Believe It is set to become a hustler’s anthem and resonate with many young, unpaid creatives who will join Riky in chanting, “S’fun’ amacoins, s’fun’ amacoins!” The accomplished rapper recently got praise from Swizz Beats who dropped the new single on his social media.   “When Swizz came into the country he said to me ‘Riky, this energy you’re coming with, you need to keep it going,’ and I decided that I need to take some of that motivation from Swizzy and jump into the studio.”  In addition to releasing the single, Riky also dropped the haunting visuals for I Can’t Believe It at midnight. “You don’t have to like me for anything, but you are going to love me for this video. I can pass away after this.” Stream or Download I Can’t Believe It here: https://SonyMusicAfrica.lnk.to/RRicbiM  Watch the music video here: http://smarturl.it/RRmacoins
