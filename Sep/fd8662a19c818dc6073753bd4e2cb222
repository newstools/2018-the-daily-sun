Kaizer Chiefs' attacking midfielder Andriamirado "Dax" Andrianarimanana has provisionally been cleared to play for Amakhosi by FIFA’s Players’ Status Committee. World football's governing decided to authorise SAFA to provisionally register the player for its affiliated club, Kaizer Chiefs with immediate effect, Chiefs said on their club website.The delay in the player's registration follows a complaint laid by Dax's former club Fosa Juniors FC wherein they claimed that they had not been approached by Kaizer Chiefs for the player's signature as he was still contracted to them."We feel vindicated and are happy the matter has been resolved. What’s important for us is that the player can now focus on his football and doing well for us," said Kaizer Chiefs Football Manager Bobby Motaung.Dax has been awarded the number 6 jersey and could make his debut against Cape Town City this coming Saturday when Amakhosi visit Benni McCarthy's charges.
