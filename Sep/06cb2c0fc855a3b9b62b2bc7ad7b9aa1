IT IS no easy task unearthing a formula to beat New Zealand’s All Blacks. The Springbok haven’t had that winning recipe in four years, having last beaten New Zealand in 2014. But without a strategy or hopes of upsetting the world’s No 1 ranked side, the Boks might as well not bother to show up for the Rugby Championship fixture at Westpac Stadium in Wellington tomorrow (9.35am). Announcing his starting lineup for the epic clash yesterday, Bok coach Rassie Erasmus said he was anticipating a “huge physical” battle. “Keeping our discipline and retaining possession will be key, because New Zealand’s ability to counter from turnover ball is well known,” said Erasmus. “That means we have to be patient, our decision-making must be good and we have to capitalise on the opportunities we create. The traditional rivalry between the two countries means we can expect a huge physical battle.” Erasmus made three changes and one positional switch in his starting team and tweaked the bench as well. Jessie Kriel moves from centre to the wing, Handre Pollard will start at flyhalf, while Malcolm Marx and Lukhanyo Am are also back in the starting lineup. Kriel replaces injured Makazole Mapimpi, who has since returned home, while Pollard replaces Elton Jantjies. Bongi Mbonambi returns to the bench as Malcolm Marx retains the No 2 jersey, while Ross Cronje is the backup scrumhalf to Faf de Klerk. “Elton can dictate the game very well but Handre brings the physicality and direct play we need against the All Blacks‚” Erasmus explained. “We are trying to mix and match to see who can handle the pressure situations – and it is not only with Handre and Elton. It is the same with Malcolm and Bongi. “I think this team is probably closest to the strongest 15 we have put out there in the six matches we have played.”
