PITSO Mosimane harbours no regret over players who have left Mamelodi Sundowns. But the pragmatic Downs coach has admitted it will be difficult to close the gaping hole in his team’s attack, left mainly by departed Percy Tau and Khama Billiat. The two-week Fifa international break will, however, afford Mosimane time to work on a few new combinations as he strives to find the right balance and rhythm. The Tshwane giants crashed out of two competitions in a week, the Caf Champions League and the MTN8 Cup, in arguably the worst period of Mosimane’s tenure. He faces an even bigger task of getting his team firing on all cylinders again. “I’m not coaching for tomorrow. . . for one match. I have to find the rhythm, the right combinations,” said Mosimane. “We have to incorporate Ali Meza, Toni Silva and Lebo Maboe into the programme. We have a very good group to move forward with. Lyle Lakay can cover for Tebogo Langerman, Mosa Lebusa for Ricardo (Nascimento), Madisha Motjeka for Wayne Arendse, Thapelo Morena for Anele (Ngcongca). Andile (Jali) is in the background and there is also Phakamani Mahlambi.” But Mosimane acknowledges the consequences of rebuilding a team, amid constant pressure to deliver. Losing out in the top eight means the Brazilians no longer have a chance for immediate cup success. “As much as it’s a good group to go for year two, year three and even year four, it takes time. You have to put it on the pitch and go through the disappointments like the MTN8 Cup.” He added: “To build a team you have to set it on fire. Yes, it may crumble. But it’s okay if we are bringing in young players like Mahlambi. We have to build a team within the team. Kekana is 33, Mabunda is 30, Wayne’s 31, Langerman is 31, Nascimento is 31. We have to rebuild.”
