RESIDENTS of Maphumulo in northern KZN woke up at the crack of dawn and blockaded the R74 in the CBD with trees, stones and burning tyres yesterday. They said the mayor was corrupt and they wanted her to resign. Businessman Sakhile Zondo (32), one of the protesters, said yesterday: “Recently, she gave her sister a tender to paint municipal cars. “Some of us run businesses but never get tenders.” Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said no damage or injuries were reported. Mayor Zibuyile Khuzwayo- Dlamini told Daily Sun: “I don’t have a sister who runs a painting business. “The residents can’t order me around. I won’t resign. They have an agenda.” Khuzwayo-Dlamini said the residents were lying. “I don’t understand why,” she said.
