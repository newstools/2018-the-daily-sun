THE situation is once again tense between rival taximen in Ladysmith, northern KZN, following the killing of another senior member of the Klipriver taxi association. Samson Hlatshwayo (56) was gunned down on Sunday. Klipriver spokesman Mfanafuthi Ndawo said Hlatshwayo was returning home when he was ambushed. He accused Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda of undermining court orders. “He’s been ignoring court orders to ensure our members are back in operation and safe,” said Ndawo. “The Pietermaritzburg High Court ruled in our favour in June last year and told Kaunda the routes are legally ours. “So he must allow us to operate without any disturbances from the Sizwe taxi association. “But he instead closed our routes. The MEC has been biased in the matter, so he’s part of this problem.” Sizwe spokesman Mbongiseni Mpungose backed the MEC’s decision to suspend taxi operations in the area. He said his association wanted routes to remain closed until differences with Klipriver were settled. Ladysmith taxi routes have been closed since December after the killing of 10 people including Mzikayifani Ngobese, Klipriver deputy chairman. Transport spokesman Mluleki Mntungwa said the MEC would meet both associations to find a solution. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a murder case was being investigated, but no arrests had been made. Hlatshwayo’s family was not available for comment.
