PUPILS are relieving themselves in their school’s yard! That is because their mobile toilets were vandalised by thugs almost two weeks ago. About 1 500 pupils at Philena Primary School in Extension 23, in Olievenhoutbosch, Tshwane are now without toilets. Parents say their children are in danger of being infected by diseases as the situation is forcing them to relieve themselves on the broken toilets or in the open. The school’s nine toilets were vandalised on 20 August by thugs who also stole toilet chambers and water pipes. Tebogo Mngadi (52), a parent, said: “We are scared that our children will get diseases if the situation is not solved.” She said the thugs broke the water pipes that supplied water to the toilets and stole most of the cisterns. The school reported the matter to the Department of Education on the same day the incident took place. Tebogo said pupils now knock off at 11am because of the water and toilet problem and parents are also worried that their children are missing classes. School governing body member Samuel Lebese (45) said they thought the department would replace the toilets. He said if health inspectors were to visit the school, it would be closed. “Other parents are now keeping their children at home, fearing diseases,” he said. Spokesman for the Gauteng Department of Health, Steve Mabona, said they would investigate the matter and provide a full response in due course.
