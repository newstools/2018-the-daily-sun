ORGANISERS of the popular Om Die Dam, Comrades and joBerg2c races have been dealt a big blow with their title sponsor, Old Mutual, withdrawing funding with immediate effect. In a statement yesterday, Old Mutual titled this a shift in strategic “focus while opening new opportunities”. Reads the statement from the investment company: “As a company with a bold new vision for the future, Old Mutual has been rigorously reviewing its strategies, including its sponsorships. Tactical decisions had to be made, including the tough decision not to renew its sponsorship of these events in 2019.” The popular Two Oceans Marathon has not been spared the axe either, as the company will also withdraw as the race’s title sponsor. “We will also be reducing our investment in the Soweto Marathon,” Old Mutual said ahead of the kasi race scheduled for 4 November. “Going forward, we will seek out sponsorships that align fully with our new strategic vision and brand focus,” said Old Mutual head of brand, Thobile Tshabalala. “We are excited about unlocking new opportunities for our customers, the communities we serve and our business.” She adds that the company will continue to support the sporting community, the arts and culture fraternity and the youth in South Africa to the best of its ability.
