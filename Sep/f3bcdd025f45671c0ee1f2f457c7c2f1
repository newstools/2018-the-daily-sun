HUNDREDS of people gathered on Sunday to pay their final respects to Prince Butholesizwe Zulu, only to find his body wasn’t at the royal palace! The son of King Goodwill Zwelithini died at his home in Ballito, KZN, on Thursday after losing his battle with brain cancer. Mourners at KwaDlamahlahla Royal Palace in KwaNongoma, northern KZN, whispered among themselves until the SunTeam approached family spokesman Prince Thulani Zulu. He then went to the podium and said people should respect the royal family’s secrets. “You don’t know which hospital he was born in so don’t worry knowing where he was buried.” The king’s absence was also noted by mourners. The People’s Paper was later told by one of the princes that Butholesizwe had been buried early on Sunday morning, as requested by his father. He said he understood why people were confused as the practice was common among inkosi but unusual with princes and princesses. Cultural expert Jabulani Maphalala said people shouldn’t confuse this prince’s burial with those who had died in the past as Prince Butholesizwe was a biological son of the king. Mourners included former president Jacob Zuma, Premier Willies Mchunu, ANC KZN deputy chairman Mike Mabuyakhulu and Minister Zweli Mkhize.
