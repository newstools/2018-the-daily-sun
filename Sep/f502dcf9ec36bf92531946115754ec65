DOCTORS are expected to always be kind and smiling when dealing with the sick. But behind the scenes they are often depressed and in need of a kind word themselves. On Sunday, doctors were urged to seek help. They met at the Leviseur Art Gallery in Bloemfontein on Sunday. Dr Tshidiso Mokeki who runs his practice in Bochabela kasi, Mangaung, is head of the National Professional Healthcare Workers Association in Free State. He said the purpose of the meeting was to raise awareness among members that they were only human. He said: “Our association plans to be radical to express doctors’ needs on issues of training and work and to also support each other, since we are just human, after all.” Psychiatrist Dr Serame Maduna said various factors in the profession could drive doctors to commit suicide. “Some of these are employment conditions and stress. Common psychiatric disorders experienced were depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and alcohol and other substance abuse. “To fight all those factors, doctors need to empower each other and they should consult,” he said. Dr Nozuko Mkabayi from KZN said she was forced to leave the profession after being declared unfit when she was diagnosed with a bipolar disorder. After discovering her condition, she was declared unfit to deal with patients. Even though she was highly qualified and had won awards within the profession, she said she was underpaid and bullied at work. Like many of us at times, she said sometimes she was in denial and didn’t take her treatment. “Finally about a month ago, I voluntary left the profession and I am currently unemployed. “Somehow, I managed to write a book about my journey. I hope to have it published soon,” she said.
