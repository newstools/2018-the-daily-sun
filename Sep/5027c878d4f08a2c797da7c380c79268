FARMERS in Hebron and Soshanguve near Tshwane are gatvol of having their cows stolen. They have now asked local cops to accompany them on inspections of butcheries and informal meat sellers. Barua Kgomo Livestock Forum members said many of them had lost their cows this year. Deputy chairman Junior Phofele (57) said: “We sought help from many government departments, but some of them left us hanging.” He said their aim was to catch those who stole their cows so they could put an end to the theft. “There are people who’ve opened butcheries that sell stolen meat,” he said. And some of the thieves apparently sell the meat on roadsides. The forum members, howver, didn’t find any stolen meat during the inspection. “The business owners said they don’t buy stolen livestock, but I suspect they received a tip-off,” Phofele told the People’s Paper Olivia Masango (32), one of the informal traders who was visited during the inspection, said she only bought meat from butcheries. “I wake up every morning to cook food for my clients,” she said. “I’m a God-fearing woman who’d never buy stolen stock.” Another trader, Badimo Rakau (49), said he had in the past been approached by men who were selling stolen cattle. “They said their uncle had given them the cow, but I knew it was stolen so I didn’t buy it,” he said. Police did not make any arrests during the inspection but urged residents to visit their nearest cop shop if they suspected someone of stealing cattle.
