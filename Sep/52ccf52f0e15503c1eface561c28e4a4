MARCEL Moses (48) was turning his life around! He was released from prison in 2016 after serving 16 years. But his life ended in the early hours of Sunday morning. An unknown man fired shots into his bedroom in Eersterust near Mamelodi, Tshwane. His friend was wounded. He’s fighting for his life in hospital. Although police say the motive for the killing is unknown, Marcel’s family believes his enemies have succeeded in taking him down. His uncle, Shaigen Moses, said there were several attempts on his life. “He was arrested for killing a boy and I suspect that someone wanted revenge for the boy’s murder,” he said. Shaigen said the family was devastated as Marcel was waiting for his ninth child. Marcel’s girlfriend Lelique Coakley (27) said she was devastated by her boyfriend’s death. Eersterust police spokesman Sergeant Sam Shibambo said police were investigating a case of murder. He appealed to anyone with information about the murder to call Eersterust Police Station on 012 806 1020/21 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
