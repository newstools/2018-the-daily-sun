THE long weekend ended in tragedy for a family. Three brothers from Protea extension 3, Soweto, were arrested for murdering their older brother on Monday night. Sources who spoke to Daily Sun said the victim got drunk and started fighting with his younger brothers, who fought back. “They assaulted him with a wooden plank and stabbed him with a screwdriver,” said the source. Another source said it was a pity the man died at the hands of his own brothers. “Siblings always fight but it doesn’t mean they should kill one another,” said the source. When the SunTeam visited the family yesterday, elders were not home as they had gone to attend the court case. A male family member chased the team away. He said the family didn’t want to talk to anyone about the matter. “We are facing a serious issue here, my brother. Please excuse us,” he said. A female family member told the SunTeam they didn’t want reporters in their yard. “Please go out now,” she said. Police spokesman Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng confirmed the incident. He said the police arrested three suspects aged between 17 and 21 for the murder of their older brother. “The 30-year-old was allegedly drunk and fought with his younger brothers. The brothers allegedly fought back,” he said. “They assaulted him with a wooden plank and stabbed him with a screwdriver in the upper body.” He said after the victim was confirmed dead, police found the three brothers in the house and they allegedly confessed. “The brothers were arrested and charged with murder. Two of the suspects are minors and were detained at a juvenile facility. The suspects will appear in the Protea Magistrates Court this week on charges of murder,” he said.
