FORTUNE has smiled on a man born without a 4-5 by
granting him a super-penis instead. According to the Daily Mail, Andrew Wardle (45) from
Manchester, England finally lost his virginity last month thanks to a penis
created by doctors from his own skin. Andrew and his girlfriend of six years, Fedra Fabian (28),
were getting ready for a romantic holiday in Amsterdam when the big moment
finally arrived. "Two days before we went away, it just
happened," he told The Sun. "It was nice and natural — and that's how
I wanted it to be." Andrew paid £50 000 (about R980 000) for a penile implant
in June, but had to wait six weeks before he had sex. His “ridiculously big”
penis is activated by a button in his groin which pumps it up with saline fluid
to make it erect. It is linked to his testicles, so the couple may be able to
have kids. He said the sex lasted about half an hour and “felt
fantastic”. Fedra agreed – and thinks Andrew’s fake penis is even
better than the real thing. She said: "It's fantastic - no need to worry about
viagra or getting old. He can do it when he's drunk too!" Said Andrew about his designer 4-5: "I'm so pleased
with it."
