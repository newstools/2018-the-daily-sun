RUBBISH collectors are angry at their employer. Yesterday they marched to the Ekurhuleni municipal offices to demand their employer, MCC Before Dawn, be dealt with. They said they had been working as rubbish collectors since 2016 and still did not have employment contracts. The workers claimed they had worked a full year before even getting pay slips from the company. Sunnyboy Masuku (42), a workers’ representative, said they had been in talks with the company, which is contracted by the municipality, for a long time to get contracts. “When we saw the company was dragging its feet, we alerted the municipality about the situation.” Last Tuesday workers gathered to confront their managers. They wanted to know why some workers were suspended for not working specified hours. “It’s unreasonable for the employer to suspend or discipline anyone over working conditions when there is no employment contract specifying the working hours,” said Masuku. Velani Magagula, a spokesman for the company, said the workers were on an illegal strike. “We have offered them contracts, but they refused to sign them. They are refusing to come back to work. “If they have an issue with the contracts, they should come back to the table,” he said.
