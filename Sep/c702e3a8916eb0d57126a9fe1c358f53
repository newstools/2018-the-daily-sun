IS there a link between rape culture and pornography? A new survey in New Zealand which included sexual health
services and schools found an increasing number of genital injuries caused by
violent sex, often inspired by porn that shows violence as being a normal part
of sex. According to the New Zealand Herald, people reported: - the increased degradation, objectification and
disrespect of women and girls; - normalising of sexual violence and force; - a disregard for consent; - devaluing of sex; and - an erosion of mutual pleasure and the normalising of
painful sex, particularly for women and gay males. Schoolteachers, principals and guidance counsellors who
responded to the online survey "gave many accounts of students viewing
porn on personal or school devices during school hours". One said: "Pornography is now the main sex educator
for young people." "Young people are inadvertently educated that it's
normal to endure or inflict pain," one person said. Health services also reported seeing negative effects of
porn on real sexual relationships. "Men are reporting problems with
'normal' sex not being as stimulating as pornography, causing difficulty
reaching orgasm or maintaining an erection," one person said. The survey was done to inform resources for youth,
schools and parents on how to deal with porn. The resources will be available
online on 1 October at www.thelightproject.co.nz.
