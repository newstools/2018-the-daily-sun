THEY did not expect to return home from work and find their children with bruises. Three parents are angry because their girls were allegedly beaten by a neighbour for playing with the intercom buzzer in Meadowlands, Soweto on Monday. Sibongile Mhlongo (31) said the alleged child beater should have consulted them first before taking matters into her own hands. Sibongile said she came home to find her daughter bruised and in pain. “I couldn’t bear the sight of my daughter with bruises on her left leg and head. “The distressing part is that she is having nightmares after being sjambokked.” Angry Tebogo Sebogo (32) said: “That woman is not remorseful about her actions. I have never laid hands on my child, so I don’t understand why she couldn’t approach us as parents.” The woman told Daily Sun: “I apologised for my wrongful action and offered to help with medical bills.” But the parents are unmoved. Meadowlands police captain Thinandavha Lufhugo confirmed that a case of assault was opened and steps would be taken against the resident. Lufhugo advised people not to take matters into their own hands.
