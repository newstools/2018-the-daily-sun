THE women of Wattville in Ekurhuleni cannot walk around their kasi in peace. This is because a man snatches their towels from around their waists! The women said they are now scared of wrapping towels around their waists. Koena Modise (31) said she was on her way to buy amagwinya when a man snatched her expensive towel and ran away. “That was the most embarrassing moment of my life. “People just stood there, laughed and took pictures. I ran away with just my panties and T-shirt on,” said Koena. She described the guy as tall and dark with big eyes. She said he did not look as if he had a mental illness. She said he was nicely dressed and even looked like someone she could date. “I actually drooled a little when I saw him. I definitely didn’t see this one coming. I smiled at him not knowing that I was letting the devil ruin my entire year,” she said. Koena is not the only one who encountered the snatcher. Noluthando Khumalo (45) said the same thing happened to her, but luckily she was wearing tights underneath. “This guy has a nerve. He is probably the same age as my firstborn. How do you do that to your mother?” she said. She warned women of Wattville to stop wrapping towels around their waists. Noluthando’s brother Amos (47) was furious with the man. “I dislike it when women go around with towels wrapped around their waists, but this doesn’t give him the right to terrorise our sisters. He’s a thirsty man who needs help,” he said. Pregnant Phindile Mabuza (27) was not just embarrassed about the incident but saddened that the man took off with one of her expensive towels. “I’m not the kind of person who goes around the street with a towel on,” she said. “In this case, I wrap a towel around my waist to keep my baby warm, but this idiot couldn’t see that.” She said they will catch him and teach him a lesson.
