IT’S been three weeks since Ralehume Primary School in Limpopo was closed down by gatvol villagers. They have accused the principal of corruption and feel undermined by education authorities. They claimed the principal was forcing SGB members to sign blank cheques. Villagers said they went to the Bakenburg South education circuit in 2014 to complain about his financial reports. This was after they realised SGB members were forced to sign blank cheques. Malose Mokitlana (51) told Daily Sun: “Ralehume is our school. We’ve decided to keep our children at home and close the school because the principal is not working with us. “All we want is the annual financial report. But he’s ducking and diving because he knows that he’s misusing school funds. “There’s a signal tower at the school and we’re aware that Vodacom is paying rent for that. But where is that money going?” Education spokesman Sam Makondo said MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe had agreed to meet community leaders.
