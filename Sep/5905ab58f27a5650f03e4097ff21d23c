A video of four thugs leaving empty handed after a failed
bakery robbery has surfaced on social media. In the video shared by social activist Yusuf Abramjee, the
men can be seen pretending to be looking at cakes to buy in the bakery. All of a sudden, one of the thugs jumps over the counter and
goes to the person behind the counter. Following that a woman who was in the shop can be seen
protecting two children from the thugs, by laying on the floor. The incident reportedly happened at the Delite Bakery in
Cape Town, last week Friday. The owner of the bakery told News24 that it was an attempted
robbery, as the men did not succeed in making off with cash or goods.
