Four people were shot and wounded in Valhalla Park, Cape Town, on Friday, police said. They were shot in Hector Street, a small road near a skate park and a primary school, at around 11:00.  Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the victims were aged 22, 23, 25 and 32. The shootings come after repeated community meetings, and marches in Valhalla Park and neighbouring suburb Bishop Lavis to stop ongoing shootings that some people believe are related to gang rivalry. Another march is planned for October 3.  Police are investigating attempted murder in this case.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/4-wounded-in-shooting-in-cape-town-suburb-20180914
