FOR 31 years she has charmed millions of soapie fans around the world as the famous Brooke Logan in the The Bold And The Beautiful. And now Isidingo fans will get to see Katherine Lang. She appears in the SABC 3 soapie today and tomorrow as Brooke Logan. Yesterday, the SunTeam was invited on set, where the star shot scenes with Soso Rungqu, who plays Morongwa. An excited Soso told Daily Sun she was over the moon to appear in the same scenes as the legendary actor. “I’m very excited to be working with Katherine. This is a dream come true for me. I will cherish this day forever. “I never thought I would appear in the same scene with her, let alone meet her.” Soso said it was a fantastic experience for her and she never expected it. Meanwhile, Katherine, who has been in Mzansi for almost two weeks now, said she was excited to see how much her character of Brooke was loved in South Africa. “I have received such a warm welcome from everyone here and it’s great to be part of a show like Isidingo that has been airing for 20 years. “So far, so good. I’m having a ball of a time here,” said the 57-year-old.
