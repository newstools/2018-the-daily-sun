WHEN her brother, who is living with a disability, told her he needed a piece of land to build a house, Maria Mokgwathi (35) spoke to the local headman. Headman Nathi Molokwane gave Isaac Mokgwathi (37) the land. But a ward committee member was apparently not happy. The woman allegedly told the headman to overturn his decision. Maria, from Xihoko Village outside Tzaneen, in Limpopo told Daily Sun that the woman attacked her when she went to ask why Isaac couldn’t have the land. “She got very angry and pushed me against the wall. She attacked me with her fists and gave me hot klaps.” Maria claimed the woman also blocked Isaac from getting an RDP in July. “She said my brother was getting a disability grant and could afford to build a house for himself.” Isaac said: “My sister was beaten because she got some land for me. “That woman hates me.” Nathi said he withdrew the land from Isaac when the committee member told him a water pipe was supposed to go through the stand. “Maria then went to the woman but I don’t know what made them fight. The matter is before court and there’s nothing I can do.” Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a suspect (29) appeared in the Tzaneen Magistrates Court yesterday and would appear again on 27 September. “The suspect has also been served with a protection order which prevents her from talking to the victim,” he said.
