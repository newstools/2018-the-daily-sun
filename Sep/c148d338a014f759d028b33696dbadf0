NEIGHBOURS could clearly hear 27-year-old Ruben’s voice saying: “Please forgive me. Please don’t kill me!” But those were Ruben Mnisi’s last words after he was burnt in his shack. The incident happened in Mamelodi West B1, Tshwane last Monday morning. When neighbours rushed to Ruben’s shack they found him badly burnt. Ruben was rushed to Steve Biko Hospital but died after being admitted. Ruben’s mum Emma Mnisi (57) said people told her they heard him begging his attacker not to kill him before his shack was burnt. “My son was a good man. I’m heartbroken because he left behind a two-week-old son.” Emma told Daily Sun she received the sad news while she was in Hammanskraal. She said she believed someone killed her son. “A man who beat my son in April continued to threaten him.” Ruben’s sister Nasiphi Majokweni (21), who saw her brother shortly before he died, said Ruben was badly hurt. “I didn’t even recognise him but I saw he was critical,” Nasipha told the People’s Paper. Ruben’s neighbour Mduduzi Mlombo (32) said he was woken by a loud noise. “When I went to check I found Ruben lying on the ground. “He was badly injured.” The family appealed to SunReaders to help them bury Ruben. Mamelodi West cops spokesman Captain Johannes Maheso confirmed the incident. “An inquest docket had been registered for further investigation,” Maheso told the People’s Paper.
