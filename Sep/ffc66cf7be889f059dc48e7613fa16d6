FORMER president Jacob Zuma said the ANC took too long to introduce free education at higher learning institutions. Speaking during a lecture at Walter Sisulu University yesterday, he said: “We took too long to implement free education. The Freedom Charter clearly states that education should be free and compulsory to all young people.” Zuma said the National Student Financial Aid Scheme was established to help the poor but had its problems. “I will never regret that I was the one who introduced free education. It was important that we made such a decision,” he told students at the Mthatha campus. Talking about the issue of state capture, Zuma said: “This is just a political decorative issue. There is no state capture. Our parliament and judiciary are not captured. How can you capture those institutions? “I would challenge anyone on that. Don’t just believe everything you hear. The problem is that we are still colonised. We take the laws that were made by other people. We should decolonise ourselves.” Sasco chairman at the campus Masixolo Sinqonqoloza said they demand free education. “We want free education at all universities and colleges in South Africa, as was promised. It is the right of all students in South Africa.”
