Rapper Cassper Nyovest had a weekend to remember. The Monate Mpolaye hit-maker hosted an epic Ciroc themed pool party at his beautiful house in Joburg. Cassper is one of the local ambassadors for Ciroc and he was recently in Milan, Italy doing some work for the brand. Cassper took to social media to give his fans a glimpse into the exclusive party. The rapper’s house caught the eye and TV personality Bonang Matheba could not help but admire. “You have a lovely home, inspiring,” she said. Cassper’s fans were also mightily impressed by his lifestyle. Check out the videos below: Monate Mpolaye!!!
