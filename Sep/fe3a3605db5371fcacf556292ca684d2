SANGOMA ONICA Moraba doesn’t use bones. She looks at her colourful flags and they give her the information she needs. ‘MY FLAGS ARE MY BONES. THEY HELP ME HELP MY PATIENTS.” Sangoma Onica from Angelo squatter camp in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun: “I look at the flags, and through them I can tell what a person is suffering from. “I call the flags my angels. They show me if I should prescribe muthi, holy water or prayer. Sometimes patients will tell me they’re haunted by a tokoloshe, but the flags tell me what they need is to be connected to their ancestors.” She doesn’t always have to prescribe muthi. “I speak to the ancestors instead,” she said. She wears a doek associated with the colour of the flag because it helps the diagnosis. “I don’t want to fail my patient, or my ancestors, and I don’t want to cheat people out of their hard-earned cash. “When people pay me it comes from the heart because they’re satisfied that I solved their problems.” In addition to the flags, she advises the clients to bring white candles and light them themselves. “I look at the way the candles flicker and drip wax to see how deep the problems lie.” Mzikayise Ngcobo said he visited sangoma Onica after struggling to get a job. “I’m a qualified forklift operator, but after I was retrenched I couldn’t get a job,” he said. “I sent CVs to different companies, but I was always overlooked.” He said he went to sangoma Onica and told her about his bad luck, but she told him it had nothing to do with bad luck. “She said I needed to open the path to speak to my ancestors,” he said. “She connected me with ancestors from my father and my mother’s side, and now I’m working again.” Nkosazana Ndlosi was struggling to fall pregnant and Onica prayed for her and prescribed muthi. She’s expecting her first baby. The prophet’s flags are mounted where people can see them from a distance. “I mount them so people can see where they can come to talk to the flag sangoma,” she said.
