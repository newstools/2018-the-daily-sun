Two
men were injured when a truck was hit by a train, while crossing railway tracks
near a mine outside Welkom in the Free State. When
paramedics, arrived on the scene they found the wrecked truck upside down on the
tracks in front of the train. “Upon
closer inspection, paramedics found two men trapped inside the truck,” Russel
Meiring said. Meiring
said Rescue Services had to use specialized equipment to free the men from the
vehicle. He
added that once they were freed, paramedics assessed the men and found that
they had sustained moderate injuries. “The
patients were treated for their injuries and they were transported to nearby
hospitals by other services,” Meiring said. Local
authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
