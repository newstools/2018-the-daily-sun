A SHOCKING security video recorded thugs pounding on the windows of a car driven by a mum. The mother reversed the vehicle into the wannabe hijackers’ car which caused them to flee on foot. While we celebrate the quick-thinking woman, what we don’t see are the cases where victims are murdered by their hijackers. Eugene Herbert, managing director of MasterDrive, said taking on hijackers is very dangerous. “Sharing these stories of victory creates a false sense of confidence. We don’t know why the hijackers did not shoot the woman and her daughter through the window. But we can be sure that there are many other hijackers who would not hesitate to do so.” “Hijacking is also an unpredictable situation for the criminals and the victims. The hijackers are full of adrenaline which could be mixing with alcohol, drugs or a belief in bullet-proofing muthi.” Some hijackers do plan their crimes beforehand but there are others who act suddenly when the opportunity presents itself. Hijacking safety When driving, be aware of other vehicles that could be following you. If you suspect someone trailing you, drive to the nearest busy public space or a police station but don’t drive past your house. Do NOT park on the side of the road or driveway. If you drive past a cop car, indicate to the police you suspect you are being followed. Hijackers are quick to vanish if they think you are onto them. “South Africa’s rise in violent crime also includes the rise in violent vigilante justice. Many do feel happy that the woman dealt with her hijackers appropriately but the truth is, she and her daughter where lucky. “Hijack training prepares you in case you face a gang of thugs but it is always a dangerous event.”
