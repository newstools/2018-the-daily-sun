THE street sellers are up in arms. Their customers are running away and their businesses face being shut down. It’s all because stinking water is running down the street where they are trying to make a living. The vendors at Mammogale Street near Saulsville Station, Tshwane told the People’s Paper they were gatvol of the smelly water flowing in front of their businesses. They said this has been happening for three months, making life unbearable. Ellen Pilosa (41) said she’s been selling in the area for 13 years. “The stinking water is chasing my customers away,” she said. Ellen complained that their local councillor failed them without bothering to listen to their grievances. “How will I survive if people don’t buy my fruit and vegetables?” Ellen said the drains near their businesses were blocked and begged the municipality to clear up the mess and to provide protection for them against the sun and rain. Trader Johanna Maswanganyi (43) told the SunTeam the municipality must intervene and save their businesses. “We survive by selling in the streets and need the area to be clean,” Johanna said. Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga said the problem was being caused by street butchers selling meat and skop. “They skin the cow heads and then the fat blocks the drainage system,” he said. Msimanga said meat traders also disposed of blood in the streets and it made the stench in the area worse. He promised the traders the drainage problem would be fixed and said a skip bin would be provided.
