A MAN who had a 60cm dildo stuck up his bum for 24 hours
was forced to go to hospital to get it out again. According to Daily
Mail, the unnamed 31-year-old from Milan, Italy arrived at hospital with
the awkward problem of having inserted the dildo up his bum the day before, but
having pushed it so far in he was unable to get it out again. For a while, doctors at the ASST Great Metropolitan Hospital
were also stumped at how they were going to remove the dildo. Besides being
very far inside the man, it was apparently very big and smooth as well. Luckily one of them invented a tool like a lasso. They
were able to thread it around the dildo, tighten it, and then slowly pull it
out again. The man suffered very little pain, saying he only had a
mild tummy ache.
