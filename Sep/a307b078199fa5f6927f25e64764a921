THE JOBURG Theatre will see an artistic reflection on Steve
Biko’s writings, being showcased on stage at the Fringe Theatre. The show is titled Bantu and will tell his life’s legacy,
and his untimely death. The show will be staged from the 20th September to 5th
October 2018. Bantu highlights possible lessons for a new generation of
South Africans and world citizens, who seek to build and contribute to a more
humane global society. “The work is composed of strong music and performances, with
a driven cast of young South Africans who engage, and reflect, upon the levels
of consciousness in present day South Africa,” Joburg City Theatres’ Artistic
Director, Makhaola Ndebele said. Stephen Bantu Biko was a student leader and anti-apartheid
activist in South Africa in the 1960s and 1970s. He was a co-founder and leader of the Black Consciousness
Movement which sought to empower, conscientise, and mobilise the South African
black population. Biko believed that black people had to organise
independently, in order to ‘infuse the black community with a new-found pride
in themselves, their efforts, their value systems, their culture, their religion
and their outlook on life.
