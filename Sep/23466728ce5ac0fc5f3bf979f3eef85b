THE Eastern Cape’s crime statistics were announced yesterday. It was revealed that crime had risen in the province, particularly in Mthatha. According to the police report, the murder rate had risen sharply in Mthatha due to an increase in taxi violence. Community Safety MEC Weziwe Tikana urged residents to help reduce the crime rate in honour of the centenaries of Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu. “As we celebrate these icons, I urge you all to look at the crime statistics presented here today. View them not only as numbers but also in terms of what you can do to ensure the reduction of various crime categories,” she said. “Serious crimes recorded in the Eastern Cape showed an increase of only 1% but that’s 1% too much. If you zoom in on the various clusters, you will note pockets of excellence which may be brought down by certain areas that underachieved.” The MEC said they couldn’t put a cop on every street corner or in every household and asked community members to work with the police to fight crime. She said crime also affected the province’s economy. “No one is interested in investing in an area where crime is high. “We’re going to launch crime prevention programmes with traditional healers,” she said. There was also a handover of 36 cars and 10 motorcycles to the police. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga said the motorcycles would be used by women cops, who would be sent to Tshwane to learn how to ride them.
