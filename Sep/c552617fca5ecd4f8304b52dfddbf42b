SPRING has hit Mzansi with a heat wave. To make sure our cars don’t feel like ovens, air conditioners struggle to cool them down. But there are ways you can use your vehicle’s air conditioner more effectively. When to switch it on? Only use the air conditioner when you are driving. This is because the faster the engine turns, the faster the air conditioner’s compressor runs and the more effectively your car cools. If the interior is really hot, put the fan on full speed and only open the rear windows for 10 to 20 seconds. This forces all the hot air out of the cabin. Don’t open the front windows because that moves the hot air to the back of the car. Use low settings Switch the air conditioner to the lowest setting and direct the fan to blow directly into the car. Do not re-circulate Turn off re-circulation if you have passengers in the back. Re-circulation forces all the hot and stale air to the back seats.
