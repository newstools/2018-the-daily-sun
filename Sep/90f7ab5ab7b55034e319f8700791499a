Renowned South African fashion designer, David Tlale will once again put on a showcase at New York Fashion Week (NYFW) this year. David will present a unique, street runway show that will debut his Spring/Summer ’19 collection. “I am excited to walk New York the David Tlale way, bringing high-end-fashion, drama and lifestyle to the streets of New York and the iconic spaces. It would not be a proper take-over without Courvoisier,” said David. David will be joined on his trip to New York City by fellow Courvoisier brand ambassadors, known as Lumieres, Bonang Matheba and Anatii. The trio is currently on their way to the Big Apple where they will all experience NYFW. During their time in New York, they will also get to mingle with socialite and entrepreneur, Livelle Collins, who will take them around the city. Fans can keep up with each Lumiere through their social media channels. “Having experienced the history and origin of Courvoisier in Paris and Jarnac last year, I can’t wait to write the next chapter of Courvoisier in one of the world’s most iconic destination cities. I feel blessed and look forward to creating many more exciting moments with David and Anatii”, said Bonang.
