UNITY, respect and the love for one another keeps the gogos of Pull Together Senior Citizens Club together. The club from Spruitview in Ekurhuleni has more than 40 members. On Tuesday, they celebrated the birthdays of members who were born between January and June. Elizabeth Mathiane, secretary of the club, said the club was started in 2004. “We started doing aerobics in Vosloorus and a Good Samaritan donated exercise uniforms to us. “Soon the club attracted other gogos, even though some of them have since died,” Elizabeth told Daily Sun. “Living in Spruitview has disadvantages because people think we have money and we don’t need help. “But we still need assistance even though we live in an upmarket area.” Gogo Elizabeth said love and respect has kept them together over the years. “We often share ideas on how to keep our families united. “We have even travelled to Cape Town and Durban.” Gogo Dudu Mulaudzi (62) said she joined the club after it was started. “But I have since become less active after losing my eyesight.” Another member, gogo Alicia Nkosi, told the People’s Paper she used to struggle to walk. “Thanks to the exercise classes, today I feel better and am able to walk without a stick. “The club has been a blessing to many gogos in the area.”
