MZANSI has been urged to take advantage of the Parks Mahala
Week to explore their own province. The South African Parks Week runs from 11 to 15 September,
local parks will be open for free to all South Africans. North West MEC for Tourism Desbo Mohono says this is an
opportunity to drive domestic tourism in the province. “During the month of Tourism, it is important to highlight
the significance of domestic tourism in the province and more so the impact
that it has on the growth of the economy. “Domestic tourism plays a critical role in creating a more
transformed, inclusive and sustainable tourism economy,” Mohono said. She encouraged people to go out in their numbers to enjoy
the unique wilderness experience the province has to offer. Parks that can be visited during Parks Mahala Week are the
Barberspan Bird Sanctuary, Bloemhof Dam Nature Reserve, Borakalalo National
