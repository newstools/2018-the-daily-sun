MARY Sefantsi has found the courage to become her own boss after working as a domestic worker at a chicken farm for seven years. The 42-year-old from Greenland, in Mashaeng in Fouriesburg, saved up and started buying and selling chickens. “I worked at a farm as a domestic worker and looked after chickens as part of my duties,” said Mary. “My boss taught me how to take care of chickens and how to breed them. I realised it would be a great business opportunity.” Mary, who has three children, was scared at first. “I thought I’d struggle. I spoke to a friend in the township, who advised me to buy one chicken at a time and breed them. That’s how I started,” she said. “When I was fired I wasn’t worried. My chickens laid eggs for the family to eat.” Business was slow at first but picked up when she started selling at social grant pay points “Today, I’ve hired two women and I’m planning to hire more when I get a bigger space to breed more chickens. I’m happy that I’m my own boss.” She advised women not to depend on men.
