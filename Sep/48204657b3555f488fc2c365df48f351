A BISHOP who is accused of raping his daughter will have to wait until Tuesday to know the outcome of his bail application. The case was postponed in the Libode Magistrates Court yesterday because the presiding magistrate, Nwabisa Jumba, was caught up with another commitment. The 49-year-old bishop has allegedly raped his daughter since 2015. The teenager, now 18, pressed charges against her father. She told the court through the investigating officer that she did not want her dad to be released on bail as she feared for her life. The bishop told the court he should be granted bail so that he can run his seven church branches. One of the branches is in Gxulu Location, where the alleged rapes took place. Church members who have been packing the courtroom for all his appearances want the bishop to be released. They said they did not believe he was guilty. He was arrested in Hofmeyr, Eastern Cape, on 4 September, where he also has a pending case of indecent assault against a relative who is a minor. The state has opposed his bail application from the onset, stating that he knew the witnesses and may intimidate them. The bishop will remain at the Wellington Prison medical centre until Tuesday.
