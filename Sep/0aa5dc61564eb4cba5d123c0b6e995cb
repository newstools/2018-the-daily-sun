A COP who was allegedly gunned down by her lover on Saturday was celebrating her 40th birthday at the time. Sergeant Nonhlanhla Mazibuko from Quarters in Mandeni, northern KZN, worked at the Mandeni cop shop. She was killed at a tavern she co-owned with the suspect in Bhidla. Her son, Andile (20) said he had gone to pick up a birthday cake when the incident happened. “All was well when I left. I was shocked when I found a number of cops at the tavern when I returned. “They took a long time to let me in, and when they finally did, I was shocked to find my mum lying dead in a pool of blood,” he said. Andile said his mum had been dating the suspect for about a year. “He was a very jealous man and they used to argue about it,” he said. Andile said the suspect’s jealousy made his mum so uncomfortable she tried to end the relationship many times, but every time the suspect would attempt suicide. Police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said the victim sustained multiple gunshot wounds to her body and died at the scene. He said the 43-year-old suspect later handed himself over to the cops. “A firearm suspected to have been used in the commission of the crime was also seized by cops. Police at Sundumbili are investigating a case of murder,” he said. Acting KZN police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi said: “The SAPS have been robbed of yet another foot soldier in an unnecessary and tragic manner.”
