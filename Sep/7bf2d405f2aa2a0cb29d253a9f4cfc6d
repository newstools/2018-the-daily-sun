WE want a crime-free city! This was the plea of churches and cops in Tshwane during a prayer session on Friday. Pastor Ambani Ramadzanga of Worshippers Family Church led the service. He said they were on a #7DivineIntervention initiative, where they would be praying for cops’ safety while on duty. He said cops needed God’s intervention to be protected and to defeat criminals. On Saturday, Rambadzanga, Evangelist Thurston Meyer and other church leaders led a march from Arcadia to the Union Buildings. Rambadzanga said they were committed to doing the initiative three times a year. “Our purpose is to pray for the streets of Tshwane and destroy drug dealers’ safe havens.” He said they also prayed to end prostitution and other crimes in the area. He said it was important to combat crime in order to have safer streets. Rambadzanga said his church also had a programme called #ReclaimingPretoria. “With God on our side, we’re confident that crime will be a thing of the past,” he told Daily Sun. Rambadzanga said crime in the city was so high that people even sold drugs in front of cop shops. He said prayer was the strong weapon to destroy all evil. “It’s time for churches to stand up and be the solution to problems faced by communities,” he said. Other churches that were part of the initiative included Gospel Chariot Mission, 836 Kingdom Ministries and Christian News. Rambadzana said anyone was welcome to be part of the initiative.
