 A car guard has been arrested and charged with assault for allegedly stabbing a motorist who refused to move his vehicle. According to spokesperson Captain Xoli Mbele, a 35-year-old male was stabbed at the corners of Kruis and Main streets in Joburg central on Saturday afternoon. "[The] victim parked his car and a car guard told him to remove his car there, [the] driver refused and the suspect crossed the street to fetch a knife," Mbele said. "He came back and stabbed the driver in the upper body. A security guard came to his rescue and apprehended a suspect." The knife used in the commission of a crime was also recovered by police. Mbele urged car guards not to force motorists to pay for parking their vehicles. "To the motorists, if you experience a situation where you are forced to pay the car guards inform the police. Motorists must give if they are willing - not by force," he said.
