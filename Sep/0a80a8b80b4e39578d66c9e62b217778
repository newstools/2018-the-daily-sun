Criminals are targeting elderly people who have SASSA cards
and rob them of their money. The MEC for Social Development, in Limpopo Mapula
Mokaba-Phukwana, said she is deeply troubled by the news of criminals robbing
elderly people. "On the statement she said it is alleged that eight
elderly people were robbed of their SASSA cards and those cards were exchanged with
false cards," Mokaba said. Money was reportedly withdrawn from their real SASSA cards. The incidents occurred in Ga-Kgoshi Manamane, Mogashoa, in
the Makhuduthamaga local Municipality. Social Development spokesperson Adele van Linde said it is
viewed a criminal and very selfish acts. She said this means the only source of income has been stolen
from poor elderly people. "The Department together with SASSA, had to intervene
by organizing food parcels since the incident, as they were left with nothing,‚Äù
she said. Mokaba said they take the opportunity to once again warn the
perpetrators of these criminal acts to refrain from such cowardly acts.
