The Lions of the North made the announcement on their Twitter account on Wednesday. “PLAYER SIGNING! Highlands Park FC is excited to announce the signing of seasoned striker, Tendai Ndoro. Ndoro is joining the team on a one year deal, he’s been training with the team for the past couple of weeks and has impressed the technical team led by Owen Da Gama!” Former Orlando Pirates striker Ndoro hit the headlines last season after being snapped up by Ajax Cape Town following a poor sting at Al Faisaly in Saudi Arabia.But his return in the PSL when he joine Ajax Cape Town caused a lot of drama when it turned out that he had played for three clubs in one season – Pirates, Al Faisaly and Ajax – which was in breach of Fifa rules.It led to the Urban Warriors being docked points and ultimately being relegated from the Premiership to the National First Division(NFD) following a long-running court saga.But now he will try to resurrect his career at Highlands. The Lions of The North are currently in eighth position on the log with seven points after one defeat, four draws and a win from six games. Ndoro has been training with Highlands for almost two months, and will hope to make his debut in their next match against Kaizer Chiefs next Tuesday at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa (7.30pm).
