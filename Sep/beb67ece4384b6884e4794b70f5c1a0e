Iconic South African designer, David Tlale brought New York City traffic to a standstill when he unveiled his latest Spring/Summer collection during New York Fashion Week. The "street" runway show saw David use two iconic New York landmarks as his backdrop. The collection, titled Azania, was revealed by 15 models in Time Square and the Highline, a former railway line that has since been turned into a park. “I always enjoy presenting the unexpected and I couldn’t think of a better place than the streets of NYC to show my new collection which is, after all, inspired by this city and its hustle and fast-forward bustle,” said David. David is in NYC with fellow Courvoisier  Lumieres Bonang Matheba and Anatii.
