IN Mzansi the law is supposed to be strict but often, arrested thugs get off with a mere slap on the wrist. Business people have also learned they dare not lift a finger against thieves as it could land them in jail. But now a video has surfaced showing two suspected thugs getting some hot klaps – from each other! As the blows land, they can also be heard crying out: “I will never steal again!” Although nobody knows where the incident occurred, Gauteng police have urged the victims to come forward and open a case. The video shows the two thugs standing in front of a mirror. In the reflection, what appears to be a security guard is standing by while the thugs feed each other a feast of hot klaps. “I’ll never steal again! I’ll never steal again!” both thugs can be heard screaming at each other as their klaps rain down. In the background are other voices and people can be heard laughing and cheering the thugs on. When the thugs appear to be stopping because they’re in pain, one of the faceless voices cautions them: “Hey, do you want me to klap you?” The thug shakes his head and is told to proceed with the smacks. When it seems the thugs are going too light on each other, it doesn’t please the onlookers, as a stern “Hey!” can be heard from one of them. The thugs, with fear in their eyes, proceed to dish out more hot klaps. When one of the thug’s klaps lands on the other thug’s neck, he immediately ducks. “Woooo! This one can’t klap,” the onlooker yells, laughing. “Why are you klapping like women?” another asks. “Must I show you how to klap?” After about a minute the thugs start to moan. “Promise that you will never steal from this shop again,” the thugs are told. They are also heard being ordered to apologise to a man believed to be the shop owner. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun the police were not aware of the incident. “We are appealing to the victims to come forward and open a case so the incident can be investigated.”
