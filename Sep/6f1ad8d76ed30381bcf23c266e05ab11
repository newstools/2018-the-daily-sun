WHEN Freedom Khumalo started painting signs on a coal box at his home, little did he know it would one day earn him a living. Today, the 36-year-old from Orange Farm, south of Joburg, has a sign writing business. His work can be seen on the streets in the Vaal, Soweto and Ekurhuleni. Freedom started painting and drawing when he was only 17. “Whenever I was angry, I’d write on the coal box. Art cools down my anger.” Freedom works at Sebenzela Market Solutions as a branding specialist. “My biggest project was painting Soweto Gold murals that people could easily see in Orange Farm and Soweto,” he said. His work can be seen at many small businesses like spaza shops, hair salons, guest houses and taverns. Freedom hopes to open a kasi school of art one day.
