NOBUHLE Zondo is relieved that her missing daughter Naledi (13) has been found alive. The 35-year-old from Prestbury in Pietermaritzburg told Daily Sun she got a call on Friday from an unknown man telling her to rush to Durban with the cops. The man said he had seen Nobuhle’s daughter walking with some thugs near the South Beach area in Durban. “The guy said he was reading the newspaper when he saw three young thugs passing by with a girl that looked like the one he was reading about in the paper,” said Nobuhle. “He said he and his three friends approached the thugs. “They told the thugs they were aware that they were with a girl who had been reported missing.” Nobuhle said she was happy her daughter was found alive. “I’d like to thank the media and everyone who prayed around the country because I believe that if it wasn’t for them, my daughter might not have beeen found.” She said all her daughter told the cops was that the thugs found her on Thursday when she was in the middle of nowhere in the streets of Durban after she ran out of money. She said her daughter told police that the thugs had threatened to give her drugs and turn her into a prostitute. “I am happy she was found before all that traumatic stuff happened to her. “For now we are celebrating that she is back home safely and I am not going to pressurise her to speak about whatever is bothering her,” said Nobuhle. She said she was planning to take her daughter for therapy sessions in future, however. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that Naledi has been reunited with her family. She said cops were investigating the case.
