A victory against Libya on Saturday will be of great advantage to Bafana Bafana and their chances of qualifying for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). The Group E clash against the North African outfit will take place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium as Stuart Baxter's charges seek maximum points. Kick-off on Saturday is at 3pm Both Bafana Bafana and Libya are on 3 points in the group, with the latter boasting a superior goal difference. South Africa last year surprisingly beat African giants Nigeria 2-0 in Uyo, while Libya eased to a 5-1 victory at home against the Seychelles. This weekend the Super Eagles will be desperate to get their qualifying campaign back on track as they travel to the Seychelles. Teams now have a greater chance of qualifying as there are 12 groups (A - L) of 48 teams vying for a spot at next year's tournament in Cameroon with the group winners and runners-up all advancing. Baxter will be hoping South Africa can win their next three matches before Nigeria visits in November as it would put them in a commanding position to qualify from the group. In the next fixture against Nigeria, Baxter's charges would only need a point for a guaranteed spot in Cameroon next year. If tied on points, tie-breakers are applied according to points in head-to-head matches. Usually held in January and February, the tournament will take place in June for the first time following a vote by the CAF Executive Committee in 2017. It will also be the first competition with 24 nations - previously 16 countries - from the African continent competing for gold-plated trophy.
