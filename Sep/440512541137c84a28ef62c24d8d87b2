FINAL-YEAR student Katlego Monareng got an emotional send-off on Saturday. Hundreds of mourners including fellow students came in their numbers to the funeral. The 26-year-old law student from Dwarsloop near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, was shot dead on 23 August, apparently by cops. This happened during SRC elections at Tshwane University of Technology’s Soshanguve campus. The Pan Africanist Student Movement of Azania member’s devastated family want answers. His sister Thandi said: “He was the only son and we were looking forward to celebrating his success. “He was supposed to have completed his studies this year.” On Wednesday, student leaders marched to Police Minister Bheki Cele’s offices in Tshwane. They said, starting today, they would make Tshwane ungovernable if their demands were ignored by the institution and minister. Leader Sithembiso Ndlovu said cops killed Katlego and they wanted the person who did this to be arrested. “We want to close the institution until the family gets justice and a private investigator should be appointed to speed up the matter,” he said. He said Ipid would fail the family. Vice-chancellor Stanley Mukhola said they had launched an investigation and the family would get answers in two weeks’ time. “It’s painful to lose a student,” he said.
