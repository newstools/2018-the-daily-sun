BUSY Malinbongwe Drive connecting the city to Lanseria International Airport in Joburg was shut downyesterday. Lanseria ward 96 residents took to the streets, demanding jobs from local businesses. Chaos broke out early in the morning when protesters blocked the road with burning tyres and stones. Cops intervened and fired rubber bullets. This sent the unruly crowd running, leaving many hurt, but they still wouldn’t back down. Protesters marched to three businesses in the area and handed over their grievances. The first memorandum was handed over to Cosmo Business Park. At first the manager refused to accept the memorandum but after some resident spoke to him, he accepted it and signed it. The protesters then went to Lanseria Corporate Estate where the centre manager accepted a memorandum and promised to respond within a specific time. At the airport, the protestes were met by cops who stopped the marchers from coming near the premises. Airport CEO Rampa Rammopo arrived and spoke to the protesters. Mautla Maela, deputy chairman of the ANC in ward 96, told Rammopo: “I’m disappointed in you, my brother. “You are black like us but you treat us like animals. Why?” The residents handed over the memorandum to Rammopo, who also promised to respond within a specific time. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed that cops had to use rubber bullets to disperse the protesters. “The residents’ application stated that they would only start at 9am. “But the protesters decided to block the road early in the morning and cops had to disperse them,” Masondo told Daily Sun.
