THE KZN national task team investigating political killings has released identikits of two men. The police believe the two have information regarding the murder of Richmond municipal manager Sibusiso Sithole (39). Cops released the pictures on Tuesday and they are appealing to the public to help them find the two men. Sithole was gunned down in March last year by gunmen who were waiting for him outside his home. He was on his way to his office when he was murdered. KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said: “We believe the two men could assist with the investigation. “Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of the two men should contact our detectives on 079 500 1341 or the CrimeStop number 08600 10111.” Police Minister Bheki Cele told the media two weeks ago that his team had identified Sithole’s killers and would arrest them soon. Sithole’s death has been linked to ongoing political killings in the province. After his murder there were rumours that he was regarded as a stumbling block by some councillors and politicians who wanted to get tenders in the Richmond municipality. His wife, Silindile, testified at the Moerane Commission of Inquiry, established by Premier Willies Mchunu to investigate political killings. One of the findings in the report, which was released to the public last Thursday, was that some of the killings took place because of ruthless competition for government tenders. It recommended that government ensures that tender processes are legal and fair. The municipality was in the news again last month after a group of former uMkhonto weSizwe members stormed the municipal building demanding jobs.
