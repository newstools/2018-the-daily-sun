MZANSI is known as a nation of boozers. To give up boozing for just a few days, let alone one, would be impossible for many. But that’s exactly what World Without Wine is challenging SunLanders to do. The organisation has launched the #SoberSpringChallenge, during which citizens will be encouraged to stay without their drink for the entire season – or 66 days! Speaking on a news channel, Janet Gourand said they started the organisation to help people who wanted to quit booze. “The organisation started four years ago when it became aparent to many of us, including me,” she said. “I wanted to stop drinking alcohol and I struggled to do so in Mzansi. “I went to Alcoholics Anonymous and they couldn’t help me. “I managed to stop when I lived in London, and when I came back I decided that, with my background in training and development, I’d design my own workshop. “World Without Wine has run a series of campaigns named Dry January and many people decided they wanted other dry campaigns. “That’s why we started #SoberSpringChallenge.” Social media users responded to the campaign on Twitter, with many people calling it a “drunk idea”. Just Hlompho: Count me out. I’m not joining the #SoberSpringChallenge and I’ve been clean for nine months. Andre861219: Not possible. I have a glass of red wine every day! Busisiwe Maduna Yoooh: I’m not signing up. Dezanavo45: Janet got a phuza face nje.
