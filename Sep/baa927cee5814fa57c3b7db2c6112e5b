HITMAN Dino Ndlovu is certainly forcing his way back into the Bafana Bafana fold for the next camp with his current form. Ndlovu missed the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya last week but Bafana could do with his quality up-front for their crucial Group E fixture against Seychelles next month. The former Mamelodi Sundowns marksman hit the 15-goal mark this season with two brilliant goals for Zhejiang Greentown in their 2-2 draw with Beijing BC in the Chinese second tier at the weekend. Receiving the ball on the edge of the box, Ndlovu shook the Yellow Dragon Stadium as he thundered in the opener. He then netted the second on the stroke of half-time. His goal is still trending in the Asian league, but it is his rich vein of form which should warrant his recall to Bafana setup. Elsewhere, Lebo Mothiba grabbed a late equaliser for Strasbourg against Montpellier in the French Ligue 1. As his fellow Bafana international, Montpellier midfielder Keagan Dolly, went off with an injury, Mothiba clinched a point for Strasbourg in the 1-1 draw. Playing in only his second match for his new club, Mothiba would have made Bafana coach Stuart Baxter proud as he came off the bench to bang in his first goal for Strasbourg. Lebogang Phiri had little impact, however, as Guingamp crashed to a 4-0 defeat to Olympique Marseille. In Belgium, Percy Tau provided the assist as Saint Gilloise ran out 2-0 winners against Roeselare in the Belgian Pro League, before going off with five minutes left. In Turkey, former Bafana star Siphiwe Tshabalala started in his first game for BB Erzurumspor as they played to a 2-2 draw with Sivasspor in the Turkish Super Lig on Sunday. In the English Championship, Kamohelo Mokotjo was an unused substitute as Brentford thumped Wigan 2-0 on Saturday. May Mahlangu has yet to start a game for new club Ludogorets, who beat Vereya Stara 2-1 in the Bulgarian Premier League on Friday.
