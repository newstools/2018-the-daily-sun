STUDENTS from the University of the Free State received advice and training on how to defend themselves. Assistant instructor Lijo Mona (27) said instructor Moitheri Mohapi introduced taekwondo to the university and founded the taekwondo association. “We enjoy the physical training and we know we’re also learning the skill of self-defence,” said Lijo. He said the word taekwondo was Korean and meant the way of the foot and fist. The sport uses quick and accurate punches, kicks and blocks and was a demonstration sport at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. It was an official sport at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. “Since we started, the UFS Taekwondo Association has become well established. So far this year, we were represented at the Swaziland Open Senior Taekwondo Championship, where they won two medals. At the Taekwondo Championship at the University of Pretoria they won four medals,” he said. Instructor Moitheri Mohapi said: “We’re determined to expand the sport through the university by teaching self-discipline and raising the awareness for the need of self-defence for students and citizens of the campus.” The association started with four members and now they have 15. “The progress is quite satisfactory as the team has faced many challenges,” said Lijo.
