SUPERSTAR rapper Cassper Nyovest is one of the hardest working rappers in the local rap industry, hence he has achieved a lot. While the star does not struggle with making hits and topping charts, the same could not be said when it came to his weight, until recently. Cassper has not found it easy to keep in shape in the past, but it seems he has managed to put his weight problems behind him. The 26 year-old has made inroads when it comes to his fitness and he has gone through an impressive body transformation. Taking to social media, the rapper shared a picture that showed just how far he has come with his transformation. Posting a before and after picture of his body on Instagram, the Gets Getsa 2.0 hit-maker flaunted his muscles. “I’ve been on the weight loss journey for a while and It’s been a learning curve of about 3 years,” he wrote, “what can I say man? The picture speaks for itself. “A whole new body altogether. I didn’t just burn fat, I built so much muscle. I can’t believe it myself.” I’ve been on the weight loss journey for a while and It’s been a learning curve of about 3 years. 3 months ago, I started a weight training program with @tumiseeco and what can I say man?
