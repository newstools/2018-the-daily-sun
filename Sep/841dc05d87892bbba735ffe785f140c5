COUPLES looking to spice up their sex life but uncertain
how to do so may find the free services of a sex fantasy website useful. Mojo Upgrade invites couples to individually answer a
survey of around 100 questions about sex options. The “Fantasies List” that each one needs to go through
varies from the slightly spicy to the outright kinky. The milder suggestions
include having longer teasing and foreplay sessions or having your partner
strip or give you a lap dance. Slightly hotter are suggestions like being fisted by your
partner, or ejaculating over your partner’s breasts/neck (known as pearl
necklace). The survey explores the use of sex toys like nipple
clamps or butt plugs, as well as fantasies involving pain or being tied up. There’s also a section that lists fantasies to do with
involving other people in your love making, whether it be having threesomes to
just having someone watch you have sex. HOW IT WORKS Each partner needs to go through the survey separately
and indicate their level of interest in the different options. It takes about 10 minutes to complete. Once you’ve both completed the survey, the website compares
each one’s answers. If both gave a positive response to an activity, then the
website shares it with you. If both didn’t give a positive response to an
activity, then it doesn’t. This spares you any feelings of pressure or embarrassment
about having sex fantasies not shared by your partner. To go to the website, click here.
