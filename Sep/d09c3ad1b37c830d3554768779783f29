FORMER president Jacob Zuma paid a visit to the late minister Edna Molewa’s home in Tshwane for an evening prayer service. Zuma was joined by ministers, Gwede Mantashe, Lindiwe Zulu and Bathabile Dlamini. The prayer services organised by government have been held daily at the late minister’s home. Molewa, who was minister of environmental affairs at the time of her death, died on Saturday from Legionnaires Disease. This is a severe form of pneumonia, which she reportedly contracted on a visit to China. President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier declared an official funeral for Molewa. Her official memorial service will take place next Wednesday at Sefako Makgatho University. Members of the public are welcome to attend. She will be buried next Saturday, 6 October. Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe said Molewa, like himself, was a product of the trade union movement. “I found her very intellectual in the way she understood content and ideas. “She persuaded people by force of argument and logic and did not impose ideas on anybody,” he said. Minister Bathabile Dlamini said Molewa had been very special to her. She said she felt pain deep in her heart when she learnt of her death.
