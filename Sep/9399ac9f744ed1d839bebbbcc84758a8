RESIDENTS of the quiet suburb of Bedfordview are still in shock after a man was gunned down at a traffic light on Monday afternoon. The incident happened on the busy Van Buuren Road in Ekurhuleni. Police spokesman Captain Andre de Jager told Daily Sun the 43-year-old man had just bought lunch at a restaurant when he was shot. “On his way home, he stopped at a red traffic light. “An auto bike with two passengers stopped next to him and they pulled out guns. “They shot the victim through the window of his car before fleeing.” De Jager said the victim drove about 100m before stopping his car, getting out and collapsing. He died on the scene. The motive for the killing was unknown and a murder case was opened. He asked for anyone with information about the incident to contact Bedfordview Police Station on 011 457 2299. The well-known businessman previously owned the Sandton Gold and Diamond Exchange, as well as Salon Prive. He left South Africa after his father was kidnapped and beaten a few years ago. His father subsequently died. Those who knew him said he was a kind-hearted person. “He was charming and was a very neat person and a legitimate businessman,” said one of his friends.
