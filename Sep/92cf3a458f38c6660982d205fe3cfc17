SURVIVORS and victims of the Vaal Uprising still have fresh wounds and scars of the day. It’s been 34 years since it happened but the day is still commemorated outside government programmes. But the ANC commemorated the day with scores of residents at Zone 3 Stadium in Sebokeng yesterday. The event was to remember the protests which took place in 1984 against the rise of tariffs for municipal services in Vaal kasis. Speaking at the event, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule said people of the Vaal fought tirelessly for freedom and the government should continue to work to make people’s lives better. “When we celebrate this day, we must never forget the huge injustices these comrades were subjected to, and the horrific situations they were exposed to and endured.” Magashule also mentioned the suffering and injustices faced by people such as the Sharpeville six, including the two remaining survivors, Reid Mokoena and Reginald Sefatsa. “We honour the people who fought for freedom. The people of the Vaal fought. I was also a resident in the area and taught in one of the schools in the area. “The youth we taught fought for freedom, it never came free. It’s time to fight as black people towards radical transformation and not be happy to survive on salaries.” He said the Sedibeng regional committee should unite and work together. “We should work with councillors to turn our kasis into good states.”
