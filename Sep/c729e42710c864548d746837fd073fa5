MAMELODI Sundowns reserve team coach David Notoane believes Rivaldo Coetzee could be ready to form part of the first team defence by December this year. Having missed the 2017-18 season due to a career-threatening toe injury, Coetzee is now back in action for the third round of in the fifth edition of the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC). The Brazilians kicked off their MDC campaign on a promising note, collecting four points in two matches – a draw with AmaZulu as well as victory over Maritzburg United in their opening fixture. Sundowns will form part of the Heritage Day celebrations at Tembisa’s Makhulong Stadium on Monday where their duel with Orlando Pirates (3pm) is part of the day’s triple-header. The day’s proceedings will open with SuperSport United taking on Bloemfontein Celtic at 11am before Kaizer Chiefs and Highlands Park entertain supporters at 1pm. The clash with Bucs is the match where Coetzee will hope to play the full 90 minutes, having been substituted in the second half against Maritzburg. “If he play 10 minutes more than last week it means there’s an improvement,” said Notoane. “At this stage we are taking it week by week and game by game. Let’s hope that by December his body will have gained enough mileage for him to be considered for the first team.” He added that Coetzee’s quality was beyond doubt, he just needed to be sharpened in terms of match rhythm “and that’s what we’re hoping to achieve with him”. He added: “We dominate games with him, which is helpful, so we’re not rushing him to be ready for the first team. We are building him slowly. The medical team will let the senior team know when he is ready.” Coetzee joined Downs at the start of last season after a move to Celtic in Scotland fell through due to a failed medical.
