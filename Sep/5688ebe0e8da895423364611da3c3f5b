MINISTER Edna Molewa will be buried next Saturday. This has been announced by the inter-ministerial committee on state funerals, which is led by Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Molewa, who was minister of environmental affairs at the time of her death on Saturday, died of legionnaires’ disease, an extreme form of pneumonia. President Cyril Ramaphosa has declared an official state funeral for the minister and an official memorial service will be held next Wednesday at Sefako Makgatho University in Tshwane. The public is welcome to attend and pay their respects. A book of condolence has been placed at Molewa’s Tshwane home and others will be available at the Union Buildings, the offices of the environmental affairs department in Tshwane and Cape Town, Sefako Makgatho University, Vaal University of Technology, South African National Parks, the South African National Biodiversity Institute and the South African Weather Service. Mourners can also attend daily evening prayer services at 7pm at the Molewa home in Waterkloof, Tshwane. Her brother, Fana Mmethi, said Mzansi had lost a great leader and activist who dedicated her life to the service of people. He said for a long time she lived the life of a liberation activist. “We tried to discourage her from politics, but she would just go on and on. From our family, we learned she really supported the government,” he said. Fana said his sister left a mark on the lives of people who knew her that could not be removed.
