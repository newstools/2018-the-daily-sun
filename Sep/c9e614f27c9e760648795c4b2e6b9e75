BLACK Leopards chairman David Thidiela is seeking holistic anger management and temperamental behaviour counselling. This is the first step on the path to healing after his shocking tribal utterances and discrimination in Thohoyandou on Sunday. Following his scolding of referee Victor Hlungwani after their 1-0 loss to Bloemfontein Celtic, Thidiela came under fire from all corners of society, with rebukes for his criticism of Hlungwani and accusations of tribalism. He appeared before the PSL and Board of Governors yesterday, where he had to explain himself. But Thidiela was remorseful before the meeting and apologised to everyone affected by his outbursts. In a letter seen by SunSport addressed to President Cyril Ramaphosa, Hlungwani, league chairman Irvin Khoza, Limpopo Premier Stanley Mathabatha, Safa, PSL, the SA House of Traditional Leaders, Limpopo, the SA Human Rights Commission, Minister of Sport Tokozile Xasa and his club, Thidiela says SORRY.. “It was not my intention to cause any harm or inconvenience,” he writes. “In retrospect, I believe the situation resulted from my view that some decisions which the referee made were not acceptable. “While this is by no means an excuse for utterances to Hlungwani, I would like to give clarity. My reference to Hlungwani as Shangaan from Giyani was in a brotherhood context and not meant to be derogatory in any way. “I meant to convey to him that, as a person who is from a neighbouring region in very close proximity, he should be well aware of the struggle the people of this area have waged over the last 10 or so years to have a Premiership club that represents their aspirations.” He says he understands how his comments could have been “misconstrued, as I was highly emotional and the language I used was unacceptable.” Thidiela adds in the letter that he has apologised privately to Hlungwani as well.
