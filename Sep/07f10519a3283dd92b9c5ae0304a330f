Our favourite queen of the dancefloor, Zodwa Wabantu has a new career path set in her sights. The party-goer has revealed that she would absolutely love to get into the acting industry and would be very happy to be on the Mzansi Magic telenovela, The Queen. She was particularly inspired when her name was mentioned by popular character, Petronella who is played by the legendary, Thembsie Matu. “My lady Connie I was watching, I want to learn about acting. I like TV, I want to be on TV. Show me the doors for auditions 2019 please. I'm ready Zodwa Wabantu, yes I will learn,” she said on Instagram. She has since told TshisaLive that her ideal role would see her dancing with Patronella. “I want to be on the streets in eKasi, a bubbly person that is living their life and filled with drama. Maybe there will be alcohol and lots of different clothing. It must reflect who I am. I will dance with Petronella. I like her. I feel like we will get along even off screen,” she told the publication. @thembsiematu @ferguson_films @connie_ferguson The Queen my lady Connie?
