AFTER Elizabeth Ngobeni (65) and Nomia Mbungela (56) were sent away from their trading spots in a market, they came to Daily Sun for help. Their story appeared in the People’s Paper in July. Elizabeth and Nomia, of Nellmapius extension 2 near Mamelodi, Tshwane, said they were chased away from the Little Harare Market by a woman who demanded protection money. After they refused, their trading sites at the market near Nellmapius taxi rank were given to other people. When the story appeared in the paper, the women heard their sites had suddenly become available again. “That woman is a coward. She could not face us but sent other traders to tell us to come back,” said gogo Elizabeth. She said she would have used her karate skills if the paper hadn’t stepped in but she didn’t want to do that. “I was arrested while fighting for freedom in the apartheid years and I don’t want to go back to jail again.” Nomia was happy when the SunTeam found her at the market. “Had it not been for Daily Sun our grandchildren would be starving. We are treated with respect now and our incomes have increased,” she said. Nomia said the woman who demanded protection money was afraid of them. “We hear she collects bribes when we are not around,” she said. By telling our story to Daily Sun we have won a battle we have been fighting for years.” Daily Sun tried without success to reach the woman allegedly taking bribes.
