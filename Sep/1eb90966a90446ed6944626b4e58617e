SIDE chicks, wives, cheaters, boyfriends and husbands will all be under one roof on Friday. Comedian and Gagasi FM DJ Felix Hlophe will be on stage at the Winston Churchill Theatre in Scottsville, Pietermaritzburg. The show is strictly for adults. No Under-18s are allowed because there will be a lot of sex talk. Felix told SunBuzz: “This is an X-rated show and children are not allowed. The show is both educational and entertaining but I must emphasise that most of the material will contain strong language. “This is a platform where we call a spade a spade, so I’m calling on couples and singles to attend the show. “I’m the voice of men who have extramarital relationships. I also give advice to married women. Maybe it’s about time women allowed men to be polygamous. “I’m not promoting infidelity, but I’m saying let’s talk about it.” The opening act for the night will be Nzuzo Cele. Nzuzo said: “I’m grateful to be sharing the stage with Felix, who is also my mentor. “This is a double-header. It means people will buy one ticket and get to see my show as well as Felix’s act.” Nzuzo, who is a teacher by profession, said his focus would be on life lessons and politics.
