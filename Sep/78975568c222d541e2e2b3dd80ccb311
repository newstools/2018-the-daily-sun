TAVERN owners in Hout Bay in Cape Town keep their patrons fit by organising soccer matches on Mondays and Tuesdays. Sibongile Ntozini (46) said the owners came up with the idea to organise a venue and ensured everyone was always there. “We can’t sit in taverns the whole weekend and on Mondays,” Sibongile told Daily Sun. “So that’s why we start here and later go and have our drinks.” Sibongile said playing soccer helped them keep fit. “This is not only about playing but also uniting the community so that it’s easy for us to help each other,” he said. Dallas Tavern owner Isaiah Zitha said they cared about their patrons, and that’s why they supported the games. “We can’t ignore their health and they can’t drink the whole day,” said Isaiah. “That’s why it’s important for us to come together with our customers to make this place united. “We know that some of our patrons don’t go to the gym. “That’s why we decided to host the games on Mondays and Tuesdays.” When the SunTeam went to the games, Isaiah’s team was playing against Armstrong Tavern patrons. Nkosiphendule Matu (36) said they appreciated what tavern owners were doing. “It shows that they’re not only after our money but also care about our health.” Mzukisi Khayeni (35) said the games were helping them keep strong. “We’re so happy about this and we hope that they won’t stop because it keeps us fit. “The fact that they aren’t focusing on making a profit only, also encourages us,” he said.
