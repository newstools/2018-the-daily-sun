NORA Gxotha (38) is having sleepless nights about her 19-year-old daughter. Nora, who works as a security guard, has been going back and forth to Home Affairs in Khayelitsha and Cape Town to try to get her daughter an ID document. “My child has been kicked out of college because she does not have an ID and they said they could not allow her to write exams without one,” she said. Nora presented a birth certificate and a clinic card when she went to apply for her daughter’s ID. “I told them my child was kicked out of school and they gave me a case number. I don’t want a case number, but an ID for my child. Now when I even just see the name of Home Affairs I boil in anger.” Goodness Gxotha (19) said she was very anxious. “For years we have been going there and I have heard of people who faced the same problem but were assisted. I can only stay at home now and do nothing,” she said. Her mother said officials even get irritated when they demand answers. “They tell us we ask too many questions and say we should go home,” said Nora. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Makgoba was confused about the case. “The department has launched an investigation into the matter. We will contact the client and her mother to gather further information to resolve the issue,” said Makgoba. Eastern Cape Higher Education spokesman Lunga Ngqengelele said: “It is difficult to comment because I don’t have all the details. My concern is how she was allowed to enter tertiary education with an ID if she is over 18? I need more details from the school principal.”
