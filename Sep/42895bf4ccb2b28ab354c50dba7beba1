MOSOTHO Mofoti wrote a book to heal and fight depression. She was raised by a single mother and being reminded by other children that she didn’t have a father killed her self-esteem. This is why she decided to write a book. The 21-year-old from Maseru in Lesotho started writing when she was 15 years old to deal with her pain. She told Daily Sun: “I love writing and playing basketball. I would like to reach a lot of people with my writing and make them realise it’s vital to be true to one’s self.” Her book is titled Be Your Own Boss. “I started writing this book in December. “It’s meant to uplift people and inspire them to live better. “I wrote it and gave it to some friends and family who wanted to start afresh.” She said the book deals with fixing your inner self before presenting yourself to the world. “We’re born with a lot of expectations. “We’re often directed into things we don’t want because we don’t even know our purpose. “I have lived a life full of pain and regret because I felt I was a failure but things fell into place the day I realised the importance of being true to myself.” Mosotho will launch her first book on 27 October in Maseru.
