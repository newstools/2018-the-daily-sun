IT DOES not rain but it pours for Pitso Mosimane. But don’t set off the alarm just yet, as the star-studded side will surely emerge from their short slump, and they could use their Absa Premiership match against Golden Arrows tonight (7.30pm) to bounce back. This league encounter at Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu should be lit, with Arrows considered somewhat of a hoodoo side for the Brazilians. Still reeling from the latest controversy, Mosimane will again step out in front of KwaZulu-Natal supporters, and defeat should be the last thing on his mind. With Arrows and Sundowns both having won just a single game so far this season, tonight’s match is a six-pointer. Mosimane, also known as “Jingles” in football circles, stressed that Abafana Bes’thende’s speed could be a huge problem for his team. Said the coach: “Remember, they gave us a hard time in the first MTN8 match (in the quarterfinal). We have to respect them and their clever wingers. “You know how Arrows play. They have a lot of experienced players and they’ve been together for a long time. The match will probably be the same as the one we played against AmaZulu. That is what we will prepare ourselves for.” Mosimane’s charges head into this match having last won a game more than a month ago when they beat Polokwane City 2-0 away. After that they played to three consecutive draws – two at home against Kaizer Chiefs (1-1) and Highlands Park (0-0), before the draw with Usuthu. Abafana Bes’thende last won a match on 5 August – their opening match of the 2018-19 season where they beat fellow KZN side Maritzburg United 2-0 away. It has been a downward spiral after that – a 2-0 defeat to Bloemfontein Celtic, back-to-back draws with Cape Town City (0-0) and Polokwane City (1-1), before a 2-1 loss to Highlands Park last Sunday. Another thing these two teams have in common is that they have both not been able to win a game at home. Arrows will be hoping to change that in tonight’s match.
