NONE of us are born knowing how to be responsible. We are taught how to behave and control our negative emotions so we can live in society. This is why children need to learn responsibility from their parents or guardians first. Cindy Glass, director and co-founder of Step Up Education Centres, said lessons about responsibilities need to be age appropriate. “Younger children can learn by making their own beds, putting dirty clothes in the wash-basket, packing away toys, brushing their teeth and hair and other simple tasks. “Older children and teenagers need to make their own beds and keep their places tidy.” “Older children can help with cooking, washing dishes, making their own school lunches and doing their homework.” What do children learn from being responsible? - Children learn that their activities are needed and worthy. - Children learn to be independent. - Children learn confidence and leadership. - Children learn skills they need to be successful adults. - Responsibilities teach children self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, empathy and social skills. - Expect errors. Mistakes are how children learn to solve problems and be reliable. Demanding perfection is toxic. - Don’t listen to their excuses. Children need to learn that choices have consequences. - Encourage your children by praise. Acknowledge and appreciate all their effort. - Teach them breaking boundaries come with consequences. - You must be the example of what you wish your children to become. You teach your children by what you do and not what you tell them to do. You are your child’s first but most profound teacher.
