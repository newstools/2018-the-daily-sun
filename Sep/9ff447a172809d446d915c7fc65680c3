THE smell of burning human flesh filled the air around the Powerline squatter camp in Motherwell yesterday morning. Just moments earlier, residents had rushed to a house where a whistle alerted them to a crime in progress. A suspected rapist was caught by residents and they burned him. A resident told Daily Sun: “The dead man didn’t live in this squatter camp. He kicked open the door of a shack and then raped the woman. “He then fell asleep. “He was apparently drunk as he had earlier been at a local tavern. “The woman quietly crawled out of the shack to inform other residents, and community leaders blew the whistle to call all of us. This squatter camp is known as a no-nonsense area. “We are tired of reporting criminals to police because they do not arrest them.” Another resident said: “Rapists make our lives hell. These days there are cases of children being abducted. “We have discovered that government has failed to control crime and violence against women and kids. “For every violent crime committed in this area, we will kill that criminal!” Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said residents were reluctant to say what exactly had happened. “A murder docket has been opened. We request anyone with information about the incident to report it to the police.”
