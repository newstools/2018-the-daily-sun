NIGERIAN authorities have destroyed over six tons of illegal drugs. The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency burned the drugs in northern Jigawa State, which is badly affected by the circulation of illegal substances. According to reports, three million bottles of cough syrup with codeine were consumed in Kano and Jigawa states before being banned recently. The public destruction of the seized drugs in Jigawa’s capital Dutse is the first since the drug agency’s Jigawa state command was created in 2003. “This is to ensure all seized drugs are permanently out of circulation and stopped from doing any further harm to society,” said CEO Muhammad Abdallah. “Stakeholders can see that once drugs are seized, they are not spare, just as it sends a strong signal to merchants that the agency will continue to ruin their illegal investments,” Abdallah said. Government representative Abdullahi Gambassa said the state was prone to drug movements. “But we are more determined than ever,” he said. – CAJ NEWS
