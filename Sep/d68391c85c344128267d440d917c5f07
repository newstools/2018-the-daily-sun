The South African Police Service released the latest crime statistics recently. However, in a quick turn of events, the SAPS have changed their tone. They have admitted to releasing skewered crime statistics! When the Police released their latest crime statistics, fact-checking website Africa Check noticed an error in calculation. When they contacted SAPS, they were informed that the police may have used the wrong population estimates to calculate the crime rate. This means that, according to Africa Check, statistics for crimes like murder are higher than calculated. For example, the police’s calculations suggest that the murder rate increased by 1.1 from 34.1 per 100,000 in 2016/17 to 35.2 in 2017/18,” UCT crime expert Anine Kriegler told Africa Check. “Using the correct population estimate shows that the murder rate actually increased by 1.7 from 34.1 per 100,000 to 35.8.” Kriegler also told Africa Check that the miscalculation has the effect of making the increases in crime rates look smaller and the decreases look larger. First, the 2017/18 crime statistics cover the period 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018. The population estimate the police used is not from this period – it’s from June 2018,” Africa Check said on its website. “Second, by using a later and larger population estimate, it appeared that South Africa’s population increased from 55,843,011 people in 2016/17 to 57,725,600 in 2017/18 – a difference of more than 1.8 million people.” The police, after being made aware of this error in calculation, quickly corrected their mistake. "Based on the advice from Stats SA regarding the correct estimates to use for computation of the crime rates, the SAPS hereby issue a revision of the crime rates based on the 2017 mid-year population estimates as at the end of September,” SAPS said on their official website. “ The revision of the estimates will neither affect the raw crime numbers nor the nine year crime rate trend but will only affect the last rate in the 10 year series i.e. 2017/2018 crime rate. “SAPS regrets the error and reaffirms its commitment to inform the public accurately regarding the methodology used in a fair and objective manner guided by pure statistical considerations."
