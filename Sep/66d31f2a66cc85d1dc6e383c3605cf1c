TWO highly dangerous awaiting trial prisoners who escaped from
police custody have been re-arrested. Percy Matimba, who was on trial for 13 cases of kidnapping,
rape and armed robbery was arrested in a shack in Tsepisong, while Daniel
Musawenkosi Sibanyoni who was on trial for house robbery in Langlaagte was
re-arrested after he burned down his girlfriend’s house in Craydon, Ekurhuleni. Percy Matimba is one of the 16 prisoners who escaped at the
Johannesburg Correctional Service during March this year. “He was on awaiting trial as a serial rapist. All his
victims were allegedly approached in the afternoon or early in the evening on
Friday and Saturday at Park Station or MTN Taxi Rank in Johannesburg. He would then travel with them and take them to an open veld
in Tsepisong where they were all raped and robbed of their personal belongings. He escaped before he was due to stand trial for serial rapes
in the South Gauteng High Court on 30th July 2018,” Colonel Lungelo Dlamini
said. Dlamini said Daniel Sibanyoni escaped while he was enroute
to court on the 16 of January this year. He said after escaping, it is suspected that he was hiding
in Ekurhuleni where he assaulted his girlfriend. After his girlfriend opened a
case of assault with grievous bodily harm, he disappeared fearing that the
police were looking for him. “Last night he allegedly went back to his girlfriend
residence in Craydon and he set the premises on fire. While he was fleeing from
the premises, police spotted him. He was arrested,” Dlamini said.
