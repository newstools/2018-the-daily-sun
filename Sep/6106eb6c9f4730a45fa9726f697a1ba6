KASI residents of Tshamahansi near Mokopane in Limpopo caused chaos on Wednesday night and burnt a Somalian spaza shop and a bakkie. This after 23-year-old Tumisang Khoza was shot dead in the shop. The dead man was allegedly one of three suspects who attacked the Somalian shop owner, demanding money, and stabbing him with a sharp tool. The 47-year-old landlord allegedly intervened and shot Tumisang, hitting him with three bullets in his chest. Kasi residents quickly mobilised and first looted groceries from the shop before later setting it and a bakkie belonging to the landlord alight. Tumisang’s mum, Dimakatso Ngonyama (43), said her son was in Witbank, Mpumalanga at school and only came home on Tuesday last week to revise for the exams. “ My heart is broken. He was a pillar to me because his siblings are still young,” she said. Dimakatso claimed to Daily Sun that the landlord had a grudge agaist her son. Tumisang’s aunt, Veronica Khoza (40) said they were still shocked by his death. “It’s as if he came home to meet his death. He arrived on Tuesday and on Wednesday he was dead. It’s painful that the landlord failed to think before killing our son.” Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that cases of business robbery, arson and malicious damage to property were opened against the mob. “We have also opened a separate case of murder against the landlord, who has been arrested. “People who perpetrate mob attacks will be dealt with harshly and without compromise,” he said. He asked anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of members of the mob to contact Colonel Mosibudi Letswalo at 082 573 2029 or report to the nearest cop shop.
