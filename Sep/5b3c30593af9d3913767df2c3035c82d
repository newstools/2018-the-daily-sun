AFTER reaching his first major final as Super­Sport United head coach, Kaitano Tembo has urged his players to remain grounded, saying there is still a long way to go. Tembo was appointed as Matsatsantsa a Pitori mentor last month and hasn’t taken long to settle in, hitting the ground running to reach the final of the MTN8 competition following a 3-2 aggregate win over Kaizer Chiefs in their two-legged semifinal tie. SuperSport beat Amakhosi 1-0 at FNB Stadium on Saturday after the teams drew 2-2 in Tshwane the weekend before. SuperSport look to be on course to become the second team to defend the Wafa Wafa trophy after Orlando Pirates won back to back in 2010 and 2011. Tembo was on the bench as assistant to coach Eric Tinkler when they won this cup last year. SuperSport eliminated Chiefs in the quarterfinals that year en route to the cup victory. Now Tembo is on the verge of lifting the trophy at the helm. He guided SuperSport to victory over Orlando Pirates in the quarterfinals of this year’s tournament before getting the better of their rivals Chiefs at the weekend. The ambitious Tembo refused to take credit for the incredible start to his coaching career. “It is not really about me. What is important is the club, working as a team. But it is vital for us to realise that we have not won anything. There’s still along way to go.” He explained the crucial role deadly striker Bradley Grobler has played since returning from a six-month layoff for a knee injury. Grobler scored a brace in the 2-2 draw with Chiefs and on Saturday ensured that his side went through when he scored the only goal. “Bradley is a typical No 9 for us. He can hold the ball, find space and is a great finisher. He is one player that makes us tick.”
