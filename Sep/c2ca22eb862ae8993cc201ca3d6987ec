THE Automobile Association (AA) has warned Mzansi motorists to brace themselves for a high petrol price hike. The AA says a spike in international oil prices and a huge swing in the Rand/US dollar exchange rate have combined to predict a knockout blow at the pumps at the end of September. "Based on the current data, petrol users will be paying R1.12 more per litre, with illuminating paraffin costing R1.17 more," the AA said in a statement. According to the association, diesel user’s pockets will be most affected with a possible price hike of R1.38 per litre. The AA said while they earnestly hope the picture improves before month end, once again it calls on the government to urgently address the policy and structural issues which have put fuel users in the front line of the Rand's weakness. "To put this in perspective, should this increase
materialise, it will push the price of 93 unleaded octane fuel inland close to
R17 a litre, off a January price of R14.20 – a total increase of around 20%,
year-to-date," the association added.
