FOR many parents, the thought of having a blind child is horrifying. And the Ngandas from Makhaza, Cape Town, have not one blind child but three! Their father Thembinkosi (54) told Daily Sun: “My wife and I didn’t know our firstborn was blind. “We sent him to his gogo after he was born and she said there was a problem.” Thembinkosi said when they took the baby to the doctor, they learned that he was blind. His wife Nontombi (51) said there was a family history of people being born blind. “We accepted it from the word go and made a promise to give our son Thando the best life possible,” she said. Thando is now 31 while sister Thembakazi is 25 and the third child, Ongeziwe, is 21. Thembinkosi said he made sure his kids grew up playing outside like everyone else. Thando has become a well-known keyboard player and has performed with Jabu Hlongwane of Joyous Celebration. Thembakazi, who finished matric last year, said the community accepted her from a young age. “I played hide and seek with the other children in the area. They showed me love while growing up,” she said.
