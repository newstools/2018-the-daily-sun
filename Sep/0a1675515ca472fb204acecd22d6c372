BANYANA Banyana started their Cosafa Women’s Cup title defence on a positive note, defeating Madagascar 2-1 in their opening match of the tournament at Wolfson Stadium in Port Elizabeth yesterday. Goals from Khanya Xesi and Nothando Vilakazi in the first half were enough to give the hosts maximum points. Banyana were without Thembi Kgatlana, Janine van Wyk and Linda Motlhalo, who ply their trade in America for Houston Dash. The trio only arrived in PE yesterday morning and were not available for selection. They will be available for the second match when Desiree Ellis’ charges take on Botswana on Friday (3.30pm). Another player who arrived on the day of the first match is Gabriela Salgodo of JVW, who was called up to replace the injured Chantelle Esau. Banyana mentor Ellis, who made history last year when she became the first woman to win the Cosafa Cup for South Africa as both captain and coach, is using this competition to prepare for the 2018 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations which will be hosted by Ghana from 17 November to 1 December. After Banyana’s clash with Botswana they face Malawi on Monday. Banyana finished the match with 10 players after debutant Thato Letsoso was sent off. She received two yellow cards during the match.
