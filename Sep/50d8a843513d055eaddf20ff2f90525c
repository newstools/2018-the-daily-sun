ANC interference with the closure of Gupta accounts left two of South Africa’s big banks worried. Representatives from FNB and Absa yesterday told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Joburg, it was the first time banks had been asked by a political party to explain their decisions. Johan Burger from FNB told the hearing he received a call from Enoch Godongwana, the head of the ANC’s economic transformation committee, inviting him to a meeting with Gwede Mantashe at Luthuli House. Burger said when he asked Godongwana what the purpose of the meeting was, and who would attend, he was told it was about the closure of the Gupta accounts. Burger said he sent Godongwana SMSes asking for more details and was then told the meeting had been called off. He said he had no idea why the meeting was cancelled. “It was unexpected. In my 32 years as a banker, it was the first call I ever got from any political party asking about a bank-client relationship,” he said. Burger said he also received an invitation from an inter-ministerial committee to a meeting. This was to discuss media reports about allegations against some financial institutions. He said he tried to get information about who would attend and what the allegations were, but he got no response. Burger denied that FNB plotted with any other bank to close Gupta accounts. He said the bank provided reasons for the closure of accounts to the clients. Absa’s chief compliance officer Yasmin Masithela said the bank received an invitation from the ANC to a meeting to discuss the Gupta accounts. She said they also got an invitation from the inter-ministerial committee but said they wouldn’t attend. She said interference by those in political power would be harmful not only to the banks but also to the country’s financial sector and South Africa as a whole.
