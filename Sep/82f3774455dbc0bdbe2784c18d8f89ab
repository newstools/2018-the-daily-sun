One half of award-winning Gqom group Distruction Boyz, Quinton “Que” Mgobhozi, could not be happier right now. That is because the 23-year-old star has just become a father to a healthy little boy, whose name he has not shared with the public just yet.

The pair took to their respective Instagram accounts to announce the arrival of their first born. “Welcome to the world my boy,” Mgobhozi captioned a picture of himself presumably holding his baby while facing away from the camera. “My world,” Mayekiso on the other hand simply captioned a picture of the little one.
