BANYANA Banyana barely raised a sweat as they cruised into the Cosafa Women’s Championship semifinal with 6-0 win over Malawi at Wolfson Stadium in Port Elizabeth yesterday. A hat-trick by Player of the Match Linda Motlhalo, two goals by Khanya Xesi and Kgaelebane Mohlakoana’s maiden international goal earned South Africa a spot in the semifinals to be played on Thursday. Xesi grabbed the early opener before Motlhalo capitalised on a poor clearance by Salome Vinkhumbu to make it two goals in the first half. Lebogang Ramalepa then fed Mohlakoana, who blasted in her maiden international goal from inside the box two minutes after the break. Soon Xesi bagged her second on the day following a pass from Mohlakoana – to record her third goal of the tournament . Malawi’s Linda Kasenda rattled the upright as the visitors attempted to find a way back into the game.  But it really wasn’t a contest, no matter how hard Malawi tried to make it one. The scoreline could have been worse for Malawi, as Banyana let their opponents off the hook on several occasions. Thembi Kgatlana could also have been on the scoreboard, but unselfishly laid off for Motlhalo to score again towards the end. But there are areas Desiree Ellis would want to work on to ensure her juggernaut rolls smoothly into the final – particularly in the midfield. More importantly, Ellis has to expose all her new players to international football as she prepares for the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations in November. But the hosts have certainly sent a warning with this goal haul.
