A teenager was killed and approximately 18 other people were injured following a taxi rollover on the Frikkie Meyer Road in Vanderbijlpark on Monday morning. ER24 paramedics, along with several other services, arrived on the scene to find the taxi upright on the side of the road. Several people were found lying around the scene after they had been ejected from the vehicle. ER 24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said that paramedics began to assess the patients and found that a girl, believed to be 13-years-old, had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for her and she was declared dead. Approximately 18 other patients were assessed on the scene. Two patients, a 16-year-old man as well as another adult man, had both sustained numerous injuries and were in a critical condition. Approximately 16 others had sustained minor to moderate injuries. Paramedics treated the patients and provided the two critically injured with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, one critically injured patient was airlifted to a nearby hospital by the ER24 Oneplan Helicopter while the second patient was airlifted by another private helicopter. The remaining patients were transported by ambulance to surrounding hospitals for further treatment. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
