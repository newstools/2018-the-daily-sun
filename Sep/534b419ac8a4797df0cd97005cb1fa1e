THE case against the KZN ANC leadership brought by unhappy branches from the Harry Gwala region has been postponed to next month. The matter was brought before the Pietermaritzburg High Court by nine applicants led by Themba Mahlaba. The applicants wanted the regional elective conference cancelled but it ended up being held at the Ixopo Hall in southern KZN at the end of last month. Unhappy branch members said the conference was called without proper procedures being followed. There were irregularities, including branches not being given proper notice and the exclusion of delegates from the youth, women’s and veterans’ leagues. They also claimed they were not given the chance to query and correct pre-regional conference branch audit findings. They argued this was against the ANC’s guidelines and they wanted the outcome of the conference, and all decisions made at it, to be declared unlawful. Mahlaba told Daily Sun the court ordered the PEC to suspend the elected structure until a decision was made. Thabiso Zulu, the new leadership’s spokesman, wouldn’t comment and referred the SunTeam to provincial spokeswoman Nomagugu Simelane- Zulu. She denied that the court ordered the regional executive committee to be suspended. She said the ANC and applicants agreed the regional leadership would not do any political work until next month. The Harry Gwala region includes Ixopo and Umzimkhulu, where party leaders, including Sindiso Magaqa, have been murdered.
