GAUTENG needs six more new hospitals to deal with overcrowding in the province. This is according to Minster of Health Aaron Motsoaledi. He said he had been knocking on the door of Treasury for a long time to ask for money for the hospitals. Migration of people from other provinces as well as those from other countries was the main factor influencing overcrowding in Gauteng hospitals. Addressing the media at Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in Vosloorus, Motsoaledi said: “We are aware of the levels of migration from other provinces as well as neighbouring countries into Gauteng without added resources like space and human resources.” According to MEC for Health Gwen Ramokgopa, the population has doubled from 7 million people in 1999 when she was the MEC for the first time, to 14 million currently. Overcrowding is making it difficult to deal with diseases such as klebsiella,which the minister described as a nightmare for neonatal wards. Motsoaledi said the current infection is a multi-drug resistant strain which means that the prognosis is often poor. “Extreme overcrowding creates conditions for the infection to take place,” the minister said.
