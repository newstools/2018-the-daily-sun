BALEKA Jozi tsotsis, cops are coming for you! Gauteng cops have launched the Divine Intervention Programme. It was launched under the leadership of Gauteng deputy police commissioner Major-General Max Masha at Alleluia Ministries Inter-national in Sandton on Friday. According to police spokesman Captain Richard Munyai, four clusters from Joburg took part in the launch. Pastors from various churches also attended. Pastor Alph Lukau of Alleluia Ministries International gave a sermon and prayed for the leadership of the police. Cops at stations under these clusters will run crime prevention campaigns, where they will visit schools, churches, taxi ranks, shopping malls, liquor outlets and other community centres. The police officers will address issues relating to domestic violence, prostitution, substance abuse, rape, crime against women and children, human trafficking and murder. Churches will be invited to visit police stations to have prayer sessions and police officers will also visit churches in their policing precincts to attend church services. This will help police officers, particularly those have been exposed to traumatic experiences, to deal better with them. “For us to win the fight against crime, the community is encouraged to participate in this initiative,” said Munyai. “They can visit their respective police stations to get more information from social crime prevention, corporate communication and community policing forums.”
