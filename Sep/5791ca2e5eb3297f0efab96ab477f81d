A cell phone thief was beaten by a group of people in Hillbrow on Saturday, after a fast thinking taxi driver chased him down because he robbed one of his passengers. In two videos tweeted by REZA crime network, a man can be seen walking up to a taxi and grabbing what is believed to be a cell phone through the taxi window before running away. The taxi driver then exits the vehicle, chases after the thief, apprehends him and then hands him over to the victim, who starts kicking and hitting him. Onlookers join in on the assault. Police Captain Kay Makhubela told News24 that police were unaware of the incident.  SOURCE:Â NEWS24
