TWO years ago, the City of Joburg started rolling out an electronic health record system at primary facilities. So far 500 000 patients at 64 public facilities have been registered on the system, which is called eHealth. This was revealed by Gauteng Health MMC Mpho Phalatse this week. She said it was a milestone in the history of electronic health records. “We are happy to report this is the highest number of patients ever captured on a public health system in Africa,” she said. “This is something worth celebrating and serves as evidence that the city is transforming the face of public health.” She said the technology was introduced to make the health system run more smoothly and to make seeing a doctor easier for patients. Before the system was introduced, all the city’s health department records were on paper. Phalatse said the city had also introduced a smart queueing system, which included queue monitors in reception areas The queueing system also enabled patients to book appointments on their cellphones. In the case of a power failure, the system is connected to generators, a solar energy system and an uninterrupted power supply system. “The eHealth system will ensure secure storage of patient information, immediate transfer of patient information and better, safer, faster access to healthcare,” she said.
