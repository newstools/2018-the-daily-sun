SANGOMA Nonkululeko may have lost her eyesight, but that has not stopped her from healing people. “My ancestors show me the herbs. I also feel them with my hands and smell them with my nose and I know which I must use to help my patients,” said Alicia Fuma (67) from Barcelona, Lower Crossroads in Cape Town. She started losing her eyesight due to diabetes four years ago and doctors have not been able to help her. “At first I was stressed. I did not know how I would continue to heal people without seeing them and the herbs that I mix,” she said. “But my ancestors helped me and I know what to do.” Sangoma Alicia lives with her daughter after her house was attacked by vutha three weeks ago. “The fire came out of the wardrobe and onto my bed. “Whoever sent that fire knows that I can’t see, but they did not know how strong my ancestors are.” She said people living with a disability should stop feeling sorry for themselves and do things for themselves. “It is important to get used to new situations. I could easily have forgotten about my calling after I went blind, but I did not do that,” she said. She uses a small corner in a room where she sleeps to store her herbs. “I lost everything in the fire, including my beads and sangoma clothing. Now I am working in my daughter’s house. “There are kids here and the space is too small. I wish someone could help me fix my house,” she said. Her daughter, Nontsikelelo Fuma (42), said they could not clean up her mother’s house because the police told them not to touch anything. “They have not returned since the fire and the police tape is still cordoning off the scene,” she said.
