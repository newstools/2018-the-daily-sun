ONE person died in a shooting incident outside the Khayelitsha Magistrates Court in Cape Town yesterday morning. Witness Mzukisi Nkalana (40) said he was on his way to court when he saw people shooting. “The guy who was shot and killed was coming out of court. He was a witness in a case that had been transferred from Mitchells Plain,” he said. “The guy who shot the victim was standing close to a wall in front of the court.” Another witness said: “I was praying when the bullets were flying outside court.” Residents said they felt unsafe going to court. They told Daily Sun they wanted cases involving gang violence to be dealt with in Mitchells Plain. “To bring these cases in Khayelitsha is dangerous because even kids use this road to get to the mall,” said a resident. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said the circumstances surrounding the shooting outside the court, which happened at about 9.20am, were being investigated. “Two other people were allegedly injured during the incident and left the scene to seek medical assistance. “The unknown suspect fled and is yet to be arrested,” he said.
