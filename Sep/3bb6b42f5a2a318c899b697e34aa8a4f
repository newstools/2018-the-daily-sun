THE residents were reasonably frustrated after experiencing power outages for an entire week. When they saw a man tampering with power cables on Wednesday night, they dealt with him. They forced him to reconnect all 10 houses that had no power. Apparently, there had been power failures in KwaMashu J section, north of Durban, since last Friday. The angry residents told Daily Sun the municipality did send workers to sort out the problem. Said one resident: “But after a few hours there would be a power failure again. On Wednesday night municipal workers had just fixed the problem when the power went off again. “We then heard residents shouting that there was someone tampering with electricity cables.” She said they now suspected the man was behind the annoying power outages. “About 10 houses had no electricity at the time,” the woman told the People’s Paper. They then asked him to restore electricity. “We wanted to beat him. He was causing problems for us,” said the angry resident. She said the man only reconnected six houses because cops came and took him away. Another resident said the power failure was caused by izinyoka. “The man had a ladder when he was found tampering with cables. “It’s obvious he’s behind the constant power failure in our area.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said no case was opened. “Residents are advised to come forward if they believe the man tampered with their electricity supply.”
