THE family of Musawenkosi Mchunu, who was gunned down in May, said if they had their way the suspected killers would not be granted bail. They were speaking from their home in Kwapata hear Pietermaritzburg, KZN Midlands, on Monday. They expressed their satisfaction at the commitment shown by the police. Six suspects including Msunduzi ward 10 councillor Nkosinathi Gambu and Gift Zungu, the son of uMgungundlovu deputy mayor Fucwana Zungu, were bust by a special task team last week. The two accused have been charged with the murder of Mchunu, a vocal supporter of President Cyril Ramaphosa. “Our relative was killed in the most brutal fashion, and our feeling is that the suspects shouldn’t be granted bail,” said family spokesman Bonginkosi Zuma. He said the arrest of Gambu and Zungu confirmed their suspicions that Mchunu’s murder on 11 May was politically motivated. “The person arrested is a local leader who lives in our neighbourhood,” said Zuma. “If truth be told, we’ve been hurting since the incident took place. “Maqatha’s two wives and two kids have had a difficult time since his killing.” He said they hoped cops would speed up investigations. “Families whose members were killed across the province also deserve closure,” he told the People’s Paper. “We call on the police to work tirelessly to arrest those responsible for other killings.” Zuma said they were grateful for the support shown by Ramaphosa and other ANC leaders. Ramaphosa had visited them on 14 May, three days after Mchunu’s murder. The suspects are being kept in custody. They will reappear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court tomorrow for a bail application.
