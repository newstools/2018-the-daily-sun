WHAT IS a urinary tract infection? It’s a painful infection mostly caused by E.coli bacteria. E. coli normally lives in the colon and can be found around the anus. Perhaps because of improper wiping, this bacteria enters the urinary tract through the urethra and travels to the bladder where it grows into a colony. This causes an infection called cystitis which inflames the bladder. If left untreated, it can spread to any part of your urinary system from your urethra – such as your kidneys – and cause excessive discomfort. It’s important to consult your doctor for a medical history and physical exam – after that, your doctor may request lab tests to help diagnose the cause of your symptoms before treatment can begin. Symptoms of urinary tract infection - Dysuria or painful urination - Frequent urination - Urinary urgency - Lower abdominal tenderness and lower back pain - Blood in urine - Strong-smelling urine - Cloudy urine If you experience any of these symptoms it is advisable to follow up on them and make an appointment with your doctor. – HEALTH24.COM
