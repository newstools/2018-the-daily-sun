AFTER surrendering their unbeaten run of three years against Orlando Pirates in the Absa Premiership on Saturday, SuperSport United are hoping to return to winning ways in their next league game. The Tshwane giants found themselves on the losing end for the first time in 10 matches against the Buccaneers when they went down 3-1 at Orlando Stadium. Bongani Khumalo cancelled out Vincent Pule’s first half opener, but Bucs substitute Thembinkosi Lorch and Ben Motshwari’s late goals helped the home side to their first three points against the three-times league champions since 2015. Matsatsantsa a Pitori host newly promoted Black Leopards at the Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville in their next match on Sunday (3pm). Kaitano Tembo’s side will use that game as dress rehearsal for their MTN8 Cup final against Cape Town City FC at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on 29 September. Tembo and his captain Dean Furman agree that they cannot afford to lose their next match ahead of the grand finale in KwaZulu-Natal. Bafana Bafana midfielder Furman said they had a good run against Pirates. “We have enjoyed our run against them but they are a big team, we can’t beat them every time. We have an important home game against Leopards this week and can’t think about the final yet. It’s important to win that game to boost morale in camp.” Before the defeat, Matsatsantsa were on a good run of four unbeaten matches as they booked their place in the first domestic cup final of the season. Furman urged his team to rediscover the form that saw them make a great start to the season. “We lost our first match of the season and won three games in a row. We have big aspirations in the league. The run is broken – we hope to start another.” Tembo echoed his skipper’ sentiments and expects a better performance from his troops against Leopards. He said: “I expect us to get the three points.”
