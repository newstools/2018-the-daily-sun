KEDIBONE Mahlangu (33) from Soshanguve block PP2, Tshwane, lives with a disability and is struggling to survive. And to make matters worse, her ID has allegedly been duplicated. Instead of resolving the problem, Kedibone’s ID was blocked. Her gogo Mariam Jiyane (74) told Daily Sun the problem started in May last year when Kedibone went to Soshanguve Home Affairs to apply for her one-year-old child’s birth certificate. Miriam said her granddaughter forgot her ID at Home Affairs. When she went back the following day she found it but it had already been blocked. “We asked what had happened and officials told us another person had the same ID number in Mpumalanga and they couldn’t do anything.” Home Affairs aked Kedibone to give her fingerprints, but that still didn’t help. Mabopane Home Affairs also said her ID was blocked and that they couldn’t do anything. She last visited Home Affairs on 3 August. “Officials at Soshanguve Home Affairs told Kedibone to bring an affidavit, but still her problem couldn’t be resolved,” said the gogo. Thabo Mokgola, a spokesman for Home Affairs, said officials would contact Kedibone to resolve the issue.
