Mamelodi Sundowns needed a late equaliser on Sunday afternoon to earn a 3-3 league draw with AmaZulu at the King Zwelithini Stadium. Usuthu were up and running after just four minutes when Butholezwe Ncube dispossessed Andile Jali and then struck a low drive from 30-yards out into the bottom corner. AmaZulu continued to enjoy good ball possession, but having failed to add to their tally, they were punished in the 27th minute when Phakamani Mahlambi sprinted onto a long ball from Hlompho Kekana and beat Moeneeb Josephs at the second attempt. It was Sundowns who enjoyed the upper hand for the remainder of the first half, but apart from a couple of half chances, they didn't appear likely to score again. That changed though just a few seconds into the second stanza in Durban as Toni Silva beat two defenders down the right flank before squeezing the ball past Josephs from a tight angle to put the Pretoria team ahead for the first time. Usuthu's response was swift as they levelled the scoreline two minutes later when Jabulani Ncobeni put the ball into an empty net after Pieterse had flapped unsuccessfully at a cross from Thembela Sikhakhane. It got worse for Masandawana in the 72nd minute when some clever interplay from the hosts from a free kick ended with Bongi Ntuli, on loan from Sundowns, prodding the ball home from close range. But the Pretoria outfit were determined not to go home empty handed and they grabbed a share of the spoils through Subusiso Vilakazi, who snuck in at the near post five minutes from time to steer in a Tebogo Langerman cross SOURCE:Â SPORT24
