Lower Crossroads residents in Philippi East, Cape Town are shocked after three people were found dead from smoke inhalation. Mawonga Mpekula (55), his 25-year-old girlfriend and neighbour Nozibonelo Mcunukelwa (55) were found dead, sitting in chairs! Mawonga’s son Ayanda Mpekula (29) received a call informing him that his father’s house was on fire. “My friend called me and I ran there. “When I got there, the fire was already out and what I found was very strange. They were all still sitting in the chairs! “The light was still switched on,” said Ayanda. Ayanda thinks a cigarette might have caused the fire. “Maybe they were smoking,” he said. Nozibonelo’s daughter, Ncumisa Qolo (32), is devastated her mother died. “I told her not to go out. If I knew she was going to die, I would have forced her to stay,” said Ncumisa. When the SunTeam arrived at the scene, the bodies of the three people had been taken outside. Everything in the house was burned, but none of the bodies had any burn wounds. The residents who put out the fire said it was too late to save them. “The burglar gate was locked. We shouted their names and tried to open the door. But when we got to them they were already dead,” said Zikhona Kamteni. Fire and rescue services spokesman Theo Layne said: “By the time we arrived, the fire had been extinguished but three people had died due to smoke inhalation. “The cause of the fire is unknown at this stage.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said: “A death inquest case has been opened after three people died in Ncede Street in Philippi East.”
