RENOWNED boxing promoter Rodney Berman has announced the date for the much-anticipated grudge rematch between Thabiso “The Rock” Mchunu and Thomas “Tommy Gun” Oosthuizen. The rematch has been scheduled for 8 December. The Golden Gloves boss made the announcement during a radio interview after a huge outcry from boxing fans who believe Mchunu was short-changed by the judges. Mchunu suffered a controversial loss on points to Oosthuizen in their African Boxing Union cruiserweight clash at Emperors Palace on Saturday. “It was a controversial decision – if you talk to one section of the crowd they thought Oosthuizen won and other guys say Mchunu won. At the end of the day there were two excellent fighters in that ring, so the fight definitely calls for a rematch,” said Berman. He said Mchunu’s camp have already signed the contract. He will be meeting with Oosthuizen’s manager, Harold Volbrecht, today. Mchunu’s mentor Shaun Smith said they are excited about the news. “I’m grateful to Berman. Some people would leave you high and dry after such a bad decision,” he said. “I believe we won the fight and we will win again. We’ll have to do it differently. I can’t understand how we lost. Anyway, this is sport, such things happen. Human error was involved,” said Smith. However, Volbrecht believes Oosthuizen won and said they didn’t have a problem giving the former champ a rematch. “I think Oosthuizen won the fight, only I don’t agree with the numbers. “We have put in a challenge for Kevin Lerena’s IBO belt – after that fight we’ll give Mchunu a rematch,” he said.
