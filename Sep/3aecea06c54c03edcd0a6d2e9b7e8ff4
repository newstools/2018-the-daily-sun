A COP allegedly shot and killed his wife and brother-in-law before killing himself on Wednesday evening. When Daily Sun visited the family yesterday, family spokesman Mawabo Mwandu: “We are not ready to talk to the media.” The incident unfolded at Nompumelelo squatter camp, Beacon Bay in East London. A neighbour, Anela Gomba (27) said the cop went to the nearest spaza shop to buy cigarettes. “He asked for a box of cigarettes, but it was not available, so he asked me to buy cigarettes for him at another spaza shop. On my way back, I heard several gunshots. My mum told me not to go to that house.” Anela said they went to the same church as the couple. “They were very nice to the people. I do not know what led to this, but on Tuesday night I heard them arguing. “I am not sure what the cause of their argument was. I am still very shocked,” she said. Police spokeswoman Warrant Officer Hazel Mqala said: “Constable Sivuyile Mbaduli (37) arrived at his home at about 5.30pm. “He went to the backyard shack where his wife was. He allegedly shot her. His brother-in-law, Siyabulela Cweba (44), heard gunshots and went to investigate. “Mbaduli shot him dead and then turned the pistol on himself.” Mqala said Constable Mbaduli was stationed at Kidds Beach cop shop. “At this stage, preliminary investigations strongly suggest that this is aa murder-suicide. Two counts of murder and inquest are being investigated. “The couple leaves behind four kids aged seven, nine, 12 and 15. The brother-in-law leaves two kids, who are two and 10 years old,” she said.
