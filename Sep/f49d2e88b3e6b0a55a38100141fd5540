 FIREFIGHTERS now regard Tebogo Kgoduga (30) as their hero. The fireman was off duty when the Bank of Lisbon building in Joburg caught fire last Wednesday but rushed to the scene. His colleagues arrived at the same time as him. A colleague said: “Six of us went to the 23rd floor but not the side where there were flames. It was only smoke. “Tebogo and one colleague were in the front but couldn’t locate the trapped firefighters.” At this point the colleague’s oxygen started running out. “He told Tebogo to go back to the 21st floor with him so he could refill the air and didn’t want to leave him there alone.” Tebogo pretended to be following his colleague but went back up. After the colleague had refilled his oxygen, he went up the stairs to look for Tebogo. He bumped into him coming down with two trapped firefighters. “He had managed to locate them and helped them escape,” said the source. “He knew another firefighter had slipped and fallen from the building, but he still went there and rescued them. If he had not found them, we’d be telling a different story.” Tebogo said before he went into the building, he had been speaking to a trapped colleague on the phone. “They were crying and saying we should help them,” he said. “I thought about myself and that I’d one day need help. “I couldn’t back down. I’m not a hero. It was teamwork.”
