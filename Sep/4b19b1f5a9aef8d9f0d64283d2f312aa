A MAN delighted that he was celebrating his second Father’s Day collapsed and died after a sudden sneezing fit. According to New Zealand Herald, Paul Doe (34) from Hunter Valley in New South Wales, Australia had told his colleagues at work the day before Father’s Day on 2 September that he couldn’t wait for the happy day. But his and his family’s excitement ended in shock and tears when he suddenly collapsed after a sneezing fit. His wife, Belinda Doe told 9News: "My son and I were up earlier than him and doing some gardening. We heard that Paul had gotten up. I heard him walking around in the kitchen and he started sneezing. "This was normal for him. It was a running joke if he sneezed he didn't just sneeze once, he sneezed 20 times in a row. That was just him." When 18-month-old Travis heard his dad sneezing, he ran to greet him at the door. But his dad wasn’t there. When Belinda came through the kitchen to see what was going on, she saw that he was lying dead still on the ground with his eyes closed. "It sounded to me like he was fake snoring. He was a joker, he thought it was absolutely hilarious to pretend that he was fast asleep so that's what I thought he was doing," Belinda said. It wasn’t long before Belinda realised this was not funny at all and rushed to call the paramedics. Sadly, they couldn’t save the young dad. It is not yet clear exactly what killed him. Writing on her Facebook page, Belinda expressed her amazement at the support she and her son have received after their shocking loss. “I am utterly overwhelmed by the incredible amount of support and generosity so many people have shown to Paul, Travis, and I during this time. How amazing is humanity?! “Paul always used to tease me about my optimism and blind faith in people where he was always a little more cautious about this. I guess you could say we balanced each other out in that way. I can’t help but laugh and tease him back now as I say a big fat ‘I told you so’ to him.”
