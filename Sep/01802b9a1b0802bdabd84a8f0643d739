The four Alexandra children who died when their house caught fire will
be buried on Thursday morning. The children died when their house caught fire on Sunday. It’s alleged that the mothers locked them inside the house and
went drinking. The sisters, Nelisiwe Fihlani (28), and Bongiwe Ngobeni (31) from
Alexandra, northern Joburg, were arrested after they left five children
at home to go drinking on Sunday. At the memorial of the children held on Wednesday, the Principal
of Emfundisweni Primary School, Thembakazi Giyama said she respected
grandmothers for taking care of their grandchildren when parents failed to do
so. “Young parents don’t take care of their children. They dump kids
with us and never take full responsibility when called by the schools. I don’t
understand young mothers these days,” she said.
