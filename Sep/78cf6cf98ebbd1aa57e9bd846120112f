Afro pop singer Naima Kay is ready to deliver her fourth album, titled Queen K, later this month. The singer from Potchefstroom, whose real name is Lungile Khumalo (27), said she found it difficult to choose a lead single from the album. “I was planning to release this particular single during Women’s Month. “The song talks to women and the challenges they face daily. “But we decided to release another single,” she told SunBuzz. “My music hasn’t changed much from what I used to do.” She said the plan was to work with the late Robbie Malinga on the album. “I’ve done so many songs with Robbie and he always helped me with my music. “He would come up with a chorus and tell me to complete the song. “That’s the kind of relationship I had with him.” Naima Kay said she had already prepared a festive season song for her fans. “I hope the song will be a hit. Queen K reflects a mature side of me,” she said. “I have grown as a person and an artist. “Since I can sing tribal house, I’ve decided to release a festive season song that will be a club banger,” she said. “I can also sing hip hop, house and any other genre. “I hope my fans will hear that, because Queen K is not that different from my previous albums.”
