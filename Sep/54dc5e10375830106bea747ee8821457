“WE WANT our money!” That is the angry and desperate demand made by community safety workers from Etwatwa, Barcelona and Daveyton, who say they have not been paid since 2016. Disgruntled Luxolweni Community Development members marched to the Union Buildings in Tshwane on Wednesday. Eric Sam (51), who led the march to deliver a memorandum to the Office of the President in the Union Buildings, told Daily Sun: “We have been working without receiving our salaries since 2016. We are tired of empty promises. Who on earth can work without a salary for two years?” Sam and more than 30 other workers said the community and safety department had promised every month to pay them, but not a cent had landed in their hands. The workers said they were employed to monitor primary and secondary pupils at 13 schools in these areas. Jackson Letsoalo (31) told Daily Sun: “I feel robbed of the time and service I have contributed to the community. “We stopped working at the end of August. “We were co-ordinating during the school days from 7am to 3pm.” Luyanda Mchunu (21) said: “I am young and need the money to register for a course.” Calvin Humbles, representing the president’s office, accepted the memorandum and said the office would respond within seven working days.
