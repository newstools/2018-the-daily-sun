For two months, the streets of Tweespruit in Free State have been flooded with sewage. Residents claim their complaints fall on deaf ears. They said Mantsopa Municipality allegedly worked on one of the manholes in the area and left it open. They said the hole was now blocked, causing nappies and kak to flood some of their houses. A resident Maleho Machakela said: “We’ve been living like pigs for two months and our municipality seems to see nothing wrong with it. We’ve complained to our ward councillor, but he can’t do anything without the help of the municipality.” Maleho said she has had to keep her door and windows closed because of the bad smell. “I can’t even use my toilet because when I flush, kak comes floating back into the house. I have to wear plastic bags around my shoes when I want to leave my house so I don’t smell of sewage.” Maleho said a month ago, municipal officials promised to visit the area but never came. “No one is taking us seriously. “The manhole was fine before the contractor came and destroyed it. “They claim we played a part in blocking the sewerage system by flushing foreign things down the toilet,” she said. Dumile Nana, from technical services in the municipality, said: “We’re aware of the sewer challenges in Tweespruit. “The municipality went on tender for acquisition of the necessary fleet and equipment to address the sewage challenges. “The situation’s expected to be permanently addressed by the end of September. “We would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.”
