A BEAUTIFUL traditional wedding ended in tragedy when one of the guests was stabbed to death. The incident took place in the Ngcungcwini area of Inanda, north of Durban on Sunday. Khetha Goqo (56) was allegedly stabbed twice with a sharp stick by unknown men who were also at the wedding. According to the bride, Zinhle Ncengwa (45), Khetha was trying to calm a group of guests who were fighting. “People were leaving because the wedding celebrations were done. I was told that people were fighting and I asked family members to go and check. A few minutes later, I was told that Khetha was among the injured and had died,” said Zinhle. She said they were hurt by the incident as Khetha was very close to their family. “He was the first person I informed of the traditional wedding. He was like a father to me,” said Zinhle. She told Daily Sun that her husband died a couple of years ago but they only had a white wedding. “The traditional ceremony on Sunday was held so that I could present gifts to my husband’s family.” Zinhle said they were worried about their safety as residents had threatened to torch their house. When Daily Sun visited the Goqo family, a family member said: “We were not at the scene when the incident happened. It would be hard for us to say anything about it. We request that you speak to the Ncengwa family. They may have more information.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder was opened at Inanda cop shop after a 56-year-old man was assaulted by unknown suspects. “The man sustained head injuries and was certified dead at the scene. No arrests have been made,” said Gwala.
