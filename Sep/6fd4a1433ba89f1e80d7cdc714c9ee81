TRADITIONAL medicine can be an alternative to western medical treatment. This is according to the Ekurhuleni manager of the HIV/Aids unit, Thabiso Peo. But he strongly advised patients to avoid mixing the two forms of medication as it may weaken their effectiveness. Peo said some medicines counteract each other. “It is advised that those who are on chronic medication should avoid mixing it with traditional medicine. “This will allow the proper monitoring of the medication.” The city’s health and social development department has formed a committee where traditional healers are trained in basic HIV/Aids policies and precautions. “The committee wants to ensure that traditional healers identify symptoms of illnesses that need medical attention, and promote early detection and treatment of preventable illness. “We also want to dispel myths by bogus practitioners who claim to cure HIV/Aids and advise people to stop taking their treatment,” added Peo. Sangoma Elizabeth Bass said they often have workshops with western doctors. Here they discuss the issues around the treatment they each use. “Some HIV-positive patients don’t want to take pills every day. “They must be allowed to explore the traditional route because we also have medication we can give them to boost their immune system,” she said.
