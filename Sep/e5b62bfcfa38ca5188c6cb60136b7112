NODATHINI Qiba (43) had been planning her birthday party for months. But her special day last Sunday ended in blood after a man was stabbed to death by a fake sangoma. Daily Sun published the story on 4 September. Residents of Caleb Motshabi kasi in Mangaung, Free State, are now threatening to kill Nodathini. They are accusing her of giving the sangoma the knife that killed the resident. Nodathini is in hiding as she fears for her life. “I was celebrating my birthday when my neighbour came running over, holding a knife. “He told me he was fighting with someone,” said Nodathini. “I did not want to be part of the fight, so I chased him away. “I then learned he had stabbed a man to death. “Rumours started spreading that I was next because I gave the suspect the murder weapon.” Nodathini has been hiding ever since. “These people approached my family and threatened to kill me if they found me. “I would like to tell the community that I don’t know anything about the knife. “The fake sangoma came with it to my house and his family also confirmed that the knife belongs to them,” she said. “I’m homeless and I don’t want to die for something I didn’t do. “I want a police to accompany me to fetch my belongings and leave for good.” A resident said it was safer for Nodathini to leave. “We want to set her alight because she helped this sangoma kill an innocent man. We want peace in our area.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Fikiswa Matoti advised Nodathini to report the matter to the Kopanong cop shop station commander. “We urge people not to take the law into their own hands,” he said.
