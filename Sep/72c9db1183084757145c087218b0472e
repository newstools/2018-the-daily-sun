Television presenter, actress and radio DJ Pabi Moloi will host a brand new dating reality TV show, Love at Second Swipe. Moloi along with a qualified team of experts will be making over the Mzansi dating scene one online dater at a time. Viewers should expect an “uplifting,” at times “hard-hitting,” but very emotional show as participants are taken through an impressive transformation. Mzansi has been starved of such shows and Moloi believes viewers will take to the show and relate to it. “These are personal stories,” Moloi said, “these are real human beings experiencing the anguish of wanting to love and be loved and not knowing how to navigate that and we’re going to capture those moments. “It excites me to demystify what online dating is and to help people discover the true connection with themselves before they make a match with somebody else.” The team of experts for the show will include Dr Zenia Barnard who is a life coach and stylist Shaldon Kopman. Kopman said the show will equip the participants with everything they need to conquer the dating scene. Said Kopman: “A lot of people don’t understand how to dress themselves or how to style themselves. “So in the show my role is to makeover the participants from a style perspective so that they can feel good and comfortable in their space and go out there and conquer.”
