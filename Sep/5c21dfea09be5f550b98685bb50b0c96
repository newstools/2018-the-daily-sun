KAIZER Chiefs are on a roll! Amakhosi seem to have finally turned the corner in their Absa Premiership campaign. The Soweto giants are slowly gaining their momentum in the league as they registered their third consecutive win with an emphatic 2-0 victory over AmaZulu at the FNB Stadium last night. It took a while for the Glamour Boys to get their league campaign up and running, but now they seem to have caught fire and have collected nine points in their last three matches. Ramahlwe Mphahlele and Siyabonga Ngezana’s headers on either side of half-time, put a big smile on the faces of the Amakhosi fans. Victory was never in doubt as they dominated this match from start to finish. Usuthu were lucky not to have lost the game by a big margin. Goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs and the post prevented more goals from going into the Usuthu net. Amakhosi have collected 13 points in eight games and trail log leaders Orlando Pirates by a single point from the same number of games. Usuthu were involved in a six goal thriller when they held defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns to a 3-3 all draw in their previous game. Amakhosi eased into a 2-0 victory over Free State Stars in their previous outing. The back-to-back wins against Cape Town City and Stars, boosted Amakhosi’s confidence as played like a team on a big mission. The Soweto giants played like a rejuvenated team as their passionate supporters applauded their every move. The best that the Kwa Zulu Natal based outfit could up with in the entire game, was to catch the home side on the counter as they played most of the game in their own half. Usuthu’s goal posts were bombarded with a series of shots and it was not a matter of if, but when, would Amakhosi get the breakthrough. They pressed and pressed and they were eventually rewarded three minutes before the break with Mphahlele header from a corner. The gates opened and Ngezana sealed the three points 13 minutes into the second half.
