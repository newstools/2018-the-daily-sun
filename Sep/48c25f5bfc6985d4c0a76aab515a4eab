NOTHING could have prepared the little children for the shocking discovery they made while playing. They noticed a bad smell coming from a dustbin near their home in Postmasburg, Northern Cape on Wednesday. When the kids lifted the lid and looked inside, they saw tiny fingers sticking out of a plastic bag. They opened it and found the body of a newborn baby. The children told their parents and the cops were called to the scene. The police are looking for the person who left the dead baby girl in the dustbin. Police spokesman Captain Olebogeng Tawana said: “We are investigating a case of concealment of birth. “Anyone with information that could lead us to the person who dumped the baby should contact the investigating officer, Sergeant Gabanakgang Chiri at 082 3020 391 or contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.”
