GOGO Sindiswa Mtshiawaulana used to live peacefully with her neighbours. But now the 62-year-old from Masakhaneng Village outside Groblersdal, Limpopo doesn’t see eye-to-eye with her neighbours any more. She claimed the trouble started last year when she bought a taxi to transport pupils to school. “They often speak badly of me, telling other residents I was behaving as if I was better than other people,” she said. “They even teased me that I didn’t have the money to put petrol in the taxi.” Sindiswa said in 2014 she fought with her neighbour after she built a wall in her yard. “I arrived in this village in 2010. Most of my neighbours found me here. I had two bakkies which I used to transport kids to school and to fetch water from other village to sell to residents,” she told Daily Sun. “My situation is now worse because of this taxi. “What irritates me most is that every time they gossip about me they talk loudly so I can hear them.” Neighbour Mma Mashile denied not getting on with gogo Sindiswa. “Now that she has called Daily Sun, you should come back so we can all meet the village committee. I will explain my side of the side of the story to the committee,” she said. Another neighbour, Violet Aphane, claimed: “Gogo Sindiswa and her family always bully us. They sometimes call us names and beat our kids. “Gogo doesn’t have peace. We should be living peacefully because our village is small.”
