A 36-year-old has appeared in the Midrand Magistrate Court
for being caught driving at a speed of 200km/h, on the R21 near
Olifantsfontein. Gauteng Department of Community Safety says the traffic cop’s
High Speed Unit arrested the man on Monday morning during a special high speed
operation. He has been charged with reckless and negligent driving as
well as exceeding the prescribed speed limit of 120km/h on a freeway. The man was caught speeding in his Brown Volvo XC60 and has
been released on bail of R1 500. “The law enforcement agencies will be on high alert to deal
decisively with road traffic laws violations. Road safety is everyone’s
responsibility and motorists are urged to comply with the rules of the road to
save lives,” the department said. This past long weekend, the Gauteng province recorded 26
road fatalities. Excessive speeding was among some of the factors which
contributed to these deaths.
