RESIDENTS who previously found it hard to cross bridges on rainy days will soon have nothing to worry about. It has been announced that bailey bridges, made mostly out of steel, will be built in nine villages. The villages include Balitye and Fini in Komani, Kobongo and Tora in Ngcobo, Zazulwana in Gcuwa, Nyosana in Lusikisiki, Sterkspruit and Matatiele. According to the Eastern Cape Department of Transport, Safety and Liaison, the bridges in these areas were in bad condition, while some were made of logs. In some villages there were no bridges at all. A total of R77 million will be used to build the bridges. Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana said: “This is an answer to a call by these communities to have their villages reconnected by bridges. This is after some incidents of drowning and near drowning. Children also missed out on school after heavy rain.” Tikana said the bridges wouldn’t only make their lives better but would also bring social and economic benefits to the communities. Construction is expected to be completed by March next year. Ngcobo resident Dabulingwe Ndzima said grant beneficiaries and people going to Mjanyana Hospital, which is 5km away from Tora bridge, had to wait four days before they could cross the bridge after it had rained. “This came at the right time as people have been calling for a bridge. It will now be easy for residents to pass and it will create a lot of employment for residents. We are happy that government doesn’t remember people only when they want votes,” he said. The bridges will be built by the transport department, the national departments of public works and defence, and military veterans.
