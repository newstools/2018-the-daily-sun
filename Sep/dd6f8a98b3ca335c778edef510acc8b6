ALTHOUGH his container was petrol bombed, this foreign shopkeeper said he would continue trading as he has no other form of income. Zed Choudos (45), who is originally from Pakistan, escaped a horrific attack that left his nephew Mhertu Esiase (23) seriously injured on Friday. Zed’s spaza shop in the Durban CBD was set alight while Mhertu was inside. Zed said he didn’t get hurt because he was in town when the incident happened. He said Mhertu was sleeping alone inside the container when a group of men set it alight. Mhertu was rushed to hospital, where he is fighting for his life. Zed said the owner of the house where he has his container told him she was woken by the flames and tried to get Mhertu out but the door was locked. “She said residents woke up and helped her put out the fire. They then pulled my nephew out but he was already badly burned.” The owner of the house said she had no idea who was responsible for the attack. “Zed and his nephew have only been here for two months. Since they’ve arrived, residents have been happy to have a shop in the area. I’m also happy because they pay rent of R1 500 a month,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a charge of malicious damage to property was opened but no arrests had been made.
