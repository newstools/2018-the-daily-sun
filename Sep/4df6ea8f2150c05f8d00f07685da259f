A convicted paedophile in Kazakhstan will be castrated. The castration of paedophiles was legalised earlier this year after a big increase in child rape in the former Soviet republic. The country follows in the footsteps of Indonesia, Poland, South Korea and the U.S in employing chemical castration. Daily Mail reports that an unnamed sex attacker in the Turkestan region will be the first to undergo an injection supervised by the country's health ministry. Chemical castration, rather than surgical, leaves organs intact and is reversible. Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev has allocated Â£20,500 for some 2,000 injections on men who commit sexual offences on children this year. Deputy health minister Lyazat Aktayeva said: 'At the moment there has been one request for chemical castration in accordance with a court ruling.' 'Funds have been allocated for more than 2,000 injections,' revealed Aktayeva Child sex crimes also carry prison sentences of up to 20 years in Kazakhstan.
