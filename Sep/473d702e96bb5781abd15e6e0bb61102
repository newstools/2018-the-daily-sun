JOBURG mayor Herman Mashaba said yesterday the city was experiencing more problems from churches than shebeens. He was speaking outside the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Religious Communities offices. He had earlier appeared before the commission to apologise for not co-operating to stop illegal initiation schools. “When I took over as mayor, I thought we would have problems coming from shebeens,” he said. “You know, it’s actually quite sad. It’s tragic for the country. “It’s unfortunate that we’re experiencing more trouble, more disturbance of community peace from churches than shebeens. “But I hope with the help of the commission and communities, churches are going to comply.” Speaking about the initiation issue, Mashaba said it was difficult to have by-laws the authorities couldn’t monitor. He then left the commission with city representatives to speak about the issue. After listening to the representatives, a visibly irritated commission chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said: “We’ve been begging you for two years. “We’re not accepting your opening remarks. We’re rejecting them. “If your presentation is based on that, there’s nothing we can discuss with you. It’s a waste of time.” Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said Joburg was the only municipality in Gauteng that had not come up with initiation by-laws. “You’re saying the City of Joburg being the theatre of abuse against children is to continue?” she said. “You’re saying it’s a matter of crime? So you’re not going to be participating?” Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said she would deal harshly with the City if officials’ attitude had not changed by tomorrow.
