SCHOOL pupils start coming under pressure to follow certain careers when they hit high school. As the grades go higher, so does the pressure to take certain subjects to match careers. But what subjects should they be choosing for themselves? Cindy Glass, co-founder and director of Step Up Education Centres, said pupils must choose subjects according to career needs. - Parents, talk to your children about what careers they are interested in pursuing but don’t judge them. You need to help them make a choice that suits them, not you. Ask them: “What would you like to spend every day doing?” - Discuss what subjects they enjoy the most, the least and why? - Encourage your child to focus on subjects they enjoy or feel most passionate about. What careers are supported by those subjects? - Do not force your child to select subjects for a career that you want her or him to pursue. - Seek advice from people working in those careers. The more informed your child is, the better the choices he or she can make.
