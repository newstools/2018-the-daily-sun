Orlando Pirates finishing coach Stephane Adam believes teaching the club's strikers to position themselves better for scoring chances, and to be motivated to score goals is key. Some Pirates fans were largely unsure whether a finishing coach was valuable in that scoring goals is one of the most difficult arts of the game. However, Adam, who is a former Lille, Amiens and Metz striker in France's Ligue 1, believes progress can be made if the correct techniques and practices are utilised.He told club’s official website: "As a coach for finishing, I work exclusively with the strikers and we work on situations we find in a game, developing techniques, body balance and make corrections on positioning so that we're as efficient as possible when it comes to finishing.“To me, finishing is of course the ability to take the right decision at the right time, to have the proper technique to finish actions and to score the goals, but it also has some mental aspects.“A striker has to have an obsession for goals. It's truly important as an offensive player to make sure you're in a situation and position to score goals, wanting to do it even if you miss an [opportunity].“You have to forget about [missed chances] and focus on the next one, that's a mentality problem.“So, my target is to make them confident, make them get the desire to score and get that obsession, as I said.“The more they score, the better they will be, but it's a long-term process. I'm pretty sure there will be some improvement.”
