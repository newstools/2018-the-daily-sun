SOSHA Ngcobo and his brother Bullistic thought their dreams had come true when they started making it as kwaito artists. But they learnt a hard lesson when their careers hit the wall. They ended up broke. Sosha, whose real name is Sbonelo, said they were responsible for the situation but wouldn’t give further details. He told Daily Sun: “There was a time when we would spend money on useless things. “Things started going badly when gigs started drying up and we became broke. But this situation was a lesson to us. “We sat down and came up with a turnaround strategy, which we believe will get us out of this situation.” Bullistic, of Mamasita fame, said they had managed to change their spending habits but were still trying to recover. “We can’t say we’re fine now, but we’re getting there,” said Bullistic, whose real name is Sandile. “We’re hoping to get many gigs this festive season to boost our financial situation. “We get support from our family and colleagues in the industry.” The brothers recently made headlines when it was reported they had failed to pay rent for their Durban flat. The landlord eventually took the front door off to get them to leave. They refused to talk to the SunTeam about the incident.
