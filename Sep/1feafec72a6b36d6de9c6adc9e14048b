“We take care of the suppliers that operate within our operations and we have so far invested R1 billion for local procurement.” This are the words of Sinah Phochana, communications manager at Anglo American’s iron ore business, Kumba Iron Ore, speaking about their Enterprise development programmes. Phochana was speaking to Daily Sun during our visit to the premises of 100 % black owned KELE Mining Solutions in the Northern Cape. KELE Mining is one of the companies that benefited from Kumba’s R1 billion Enterprise development programme which is specifically set aside for local procurement and supplier development. “We have what is called Technical Enablement Programme where we assess the technical skills of the suppliers to match them to the opportunities that we have within our mines and where there are gaps, we provide that training to make sure that we close the gap. “This can also be extended to their administrative services, contractual obligations and how to manage their processes and to run a business in general,” said Phochana. She said Kumba also focuses a lot on small businesses. “We incubate them and mentor them and help them market their products as well and to prepare them to be able to compete with other established suppliers and to participate beyond the mining space. "We have already spent R1.2m on that training alone,” she said. She said their focus on supplier development is rooted in lending a hand to grow small and medium businesses in our mining communities. KELE Mining is a shining example of this commitment. “It is heart-warming to see the multiplier effect their success has had on the surrounding community and other businesses,” Phochana said. Businesses that are situated within their mining communities can apply for this assistant. FACTS ABOUT THE PROJECT
