MISSED yesterday’s Daily Sun? No problem, Sipho has a copy. Need to check a story back in 2003 until today? That’s not a problem, either. Sipho’s got them. Sipho Mahlangu (42) from Mandela kasi in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane, bought his first Daily Sun in 2003. Ever since then, he’s been hooked and never misses a copy! Back in 2003, when Mzansi’s economy was in bloom, the People’s Paper cost only 80 cents. Nowadays, Sipho doesn’t need to go out to buy it as his street seller delivers it right to his doorstep daily, in appreciation of his loyalty. Sipho said vetkoek sellers know he has stacks of newspaper and often ask him for it to package their stuff, but he always refuses as each paper is precious to him. But pupils are always welcome at his place to borrow newspapers to help them with their school assignments and homework. Sipho’s house has even become known as the Daily Sun library. Residents are allowed to use the newspapers he buys every day as well. “I truly love Daily Sun. The stories are special and readable,’’ he said. “Ordinary people like myself can relate to them because they happen in our kasis.” And with so many newspapers, Sipho’s now even thinking of building a special showroom. “One day, I will build my own archive room. I share this small place of mine with the papers and while I don’t mind, it would be good to get them into a proper room,” he said. He said he would continue buying the paper. Newspaper seller Milli Modisakae (30) said: “Daily Sun is his Bible. I’m afraid he will be sick if he doesn’t read it. “Reading is healthy and I encourage everyone to read the paper every day!”
