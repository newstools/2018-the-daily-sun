STRAND residents are breathing a sigh of relief after the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association’s Lwandle branch opened two new routes. Getting to Cape Town used to be a struggle for residents. Association secretary Victor Mbande said they opened two new routes to Mitchells Plain and Cape Town. “This week, we started operating the new routes and are happy to make the lives of the people easier because they struggled with transport, especially to Cape Town.” “When we open a new route, we want it to operate all the time but how we carry on will depend on commuters. If transport is in demand, we’ll be there.” Mbande said they face a challenge with parking at Cape Town taxi rank but are talking to the relevant structures. People travelling to Nyanga from Strand will also benefit. Resident Yanga Meteni said: “I used to take four taxis just to get to Nyanga. “This new route will save us a lot of money and thanks to the taxi drivers for thinking about us.” Mbande said they want to have a good working relationship with residents but they fail them at times. “When they protest, they don’t inform us but just go to the streets and damage traffic lights. Our vehicles get damaged when they do that ,” he said “When the taxis are going on strike, we tell them so can make other arrangements. The taxi rank is open to everyone.”
