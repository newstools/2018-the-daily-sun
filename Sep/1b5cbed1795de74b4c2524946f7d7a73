IDOLS SA judge Somizi Mhlongo shared words of wisdom with aspiring fashion designers at the Durban Fashion Fair. It was held on Friday at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre. “Let your work speak for itself,” he said. Somizi and other panelists were invited to give designers advice on how to turn their talents into successful businesses. The choreographer and radio personality said it always broke his heart when he saw famous people running out of money. “We don’t want to know you well but then find that you’re poor,” he said. “That can make you depressed because of the unnecessary pressure you’ve put on yourself. “You’re designers because you want to be rich, but invest in your work. Don’t do it only because you want popularity. “You won’t last. We don’t want a poor celebrity.” He said he worked hard for his money but didn’t just grab any opportunity that came his way. Celebrity make-up artist Nthato Mashishi told the designers it was important to keep learning in order to grow. “I’ve done make-up for Hollywood celebrities, but I don’t go around bragging about that,” said Nthato. “I know I’m talented, but my talent needs to be upgraded now and then.” He said he spent most of his time doing research and polishing his talent because talent alone was not enough. “Don’t limit yourself. Learn, find out what the new trends are and don’t relax,” he told SunBuzz. The panel discussion was chaired by TV and radio presenter Anele Mdoda.
