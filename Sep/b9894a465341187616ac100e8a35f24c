MALAYSIANS are once again in an uproar following the
marriage of a fifteen-year-old girl to a 44-year-old man. According to Channel News Asia, the marriage happened
earlier this year but was only discovered onTuesday. The man is apparently already married with two kids, so
the teenager is his second wife. Reports say that the girl didn’t object, but others also
point out she comes from an impoverished family. Her parents have 12 other kids. According to Muslim law, a girl can marry as young as 16
and a boy 18. Exceptions can be made for kids to marry younger, if they get
permission from Muslim authorities. Girl brides are a controversial issue in the country,
with many believing it to be a sick practice which exploits and oppresses young
girls, often forced into marriage because of poverty. In July, the case of an 11-year-old marrying a
41-year-old man also caused outrage, prompting the Malaysian government to
conduct an investigation. Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister said discussions were
underway to reach an agreement on raising the minimum marriage age for girls to
18. “Efforts are actively carried out to implement the move
by the relevant agencies to ensure it could be achieved immediately,” she said.
