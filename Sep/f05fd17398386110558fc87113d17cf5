TSHWANE mayor Solly Msimanga launched his listening tour in his home area of Saulsville, Tshwane, on Monday. He started by listening to grievances affecting train commuters on the train from the Pretoria to Saulsville train stations. He toured with residents, taxi drivers, owners, the youth and business people. Msimanga said everything started at home, which was why he was launching his tour at the place where he was born. “It’s good to engage with residents and to hear their challenges and experiences.” He said there needed to be better co-ordination between the the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa and government. Msimanga said residents raised issues of unemployment, drug abuse, crime and service delivery. “We’re not arrogant but are a caring party. We’ll visit all the places in the province and listen to people. We’ll find a way forward,” he said. One of the residents, Abigail Khumalo (52), said they needed improved living conditions and service delivery. “We’re tired of empty promises,” she said. Msimanga promised residents they would be given fully serviced stands for free. He said the DA would fix toilets and the water system in the area and fast-track the building of houses.
