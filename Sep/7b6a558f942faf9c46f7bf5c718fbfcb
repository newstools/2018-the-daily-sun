SUDDENLY the pastor’s prayers were disturbed as the two thugs charged in through the front door. When pastor Lenah Kekana (69) resisted they hit her over the head with a spade and then ran away with computers, food, cash and other items. But the thugs didn’t get far! Residents saw them struggling with their loot. They were caught and taken back to the church and moered. Pastor Lenah said she was with her granddaughter when the church was robbed on Tuesday. One suspect was handed over to the cops, while the second one was taken to hospital after being beaten up by community members. Resident David Ramushushi said it wasn’t the first time the Holiness Pentecostal church in Zone 4 Diepkloof was broken into. “We have burglar bars but they bend them to get in,” he said. “This time they just came in through the front door.” The pastor said: “I thank my granddaughter who managed to untie herself and open the door to let people in to help us.” Captain Phephi Matlou of Diepkloof police said two suspects were arrested. They appeared in court yesterday and will make their second appearance soon.
