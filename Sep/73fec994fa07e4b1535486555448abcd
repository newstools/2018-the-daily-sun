Cele says if Mzansi control the murder rate, then there will be no joy brought to the South African people. “It looks like 57 are dying a day. It borders close to a war zone. I immediately see SAPS dropped the ball for such figures to happen,” Cele says. He added that the figures are alarming considering that there is no war in South Africa. Cele he has had a talk with the SAPS members that never again will they be reporting on such crime such statistics. “It cannot be that South Africans are put under such fear, such stress and such murder,” Cele said.
