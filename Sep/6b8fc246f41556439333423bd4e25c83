BULLETS went flying on Saturday when cops tried to stop a vehicle that looked suspicious. The trouble started in City Deep, Joburg, when the police signalled to the driver of a white Hyundai Tucson to stop. The driver accelerated. Soon, the occupants of the vehicle were shooting at the police as they sped behind them. Eventually, the cops were able to corner the suspects. Two were arrested but the other two managed to run away. Ammunition and two unlicensed firearms were recovered from the suspects arrested. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun they had launched a manhunt for the suspects who managed to get away. They believed the suspects were on their way to commit a robbery. He said more than 1 100 suspects were arrested in Gauteng at the weekend. Police conducted roadblocks, foot patrols, stop and search operations, traced wanted suspects and raided illegal liquor outlets. The suspects were arrested for offences ranging from murder to house robbery, business robbery and rape, as well as possession of drugs, and fraud.
