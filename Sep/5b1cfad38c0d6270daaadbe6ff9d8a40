MOST men in Mzansi are not satisfying their partners in
bed. Mzansi men are said to be spending less time between the
sheets and their performance leave their women disappointed. The Sun published a study conducted by VictoriaMilan – a
dating site for married people looking to have an extramarital affair – peeked
into the bedrooms of its 6117 female members. While Denmark holds the record of the most sexually satisfied women as their
husbands spend on average 44 minutes pleasuring their wives during steamy
sessions, Mzansi men spend just 15 minutes, which is below average. This is because another study shows that the average that couples spend during sex was 19 minutes. The study says Mzansi women must be feeling hard done because of this 15 minutes of sexual attention. In the United States, women enjoy a solid 41 minutes of
sex per erotic encounter while the Finnish husbands dedicate 39 minutes to
helping their partners climax. Also holding up the rear at the Belgians, who claim to
bring their partners to orgasm in 21 minutes. Founder and CEO of Victoria Milan, Sigurd Vedal, claimed
the hottest and hardest working husbands feel responsible for ensuring their
wife is kept sexually satisfied. She said: “It takes a real man to recognise and satisfy
the sexual appetite of a woman. "A common mistake is thinking that men aren’t
sexually satisfied and will stray – it actually works both ways. "Keeping a confident, beautiful and independent
woman exclusively in your bed is no easy task, and hero husbands will put as
much time as it takes into keeping the lust levels licked.”
