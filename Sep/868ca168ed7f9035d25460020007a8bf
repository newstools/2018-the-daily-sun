When the
Constitutional Court ruled on Tuesday that private use of dagga has been decriminalized,
Mzansi celebrated. However, immediately
after, questions surrounding the legalities of the judgment surfaced from the
public. Daily Sun spoke to legal expert
Professor Catherine Albertyn about the judgment. Albertyn, a professor
in the School of Law at Wits, specializes in Constitutional Law. She is the South
African Research Chair in Equality, Law and Social Justice and former director
of the Centre for Applied Legal Studies at Wits. Professor Albertyn
called the judgment “quite a narrow judgment.” She said that Parliament
is yet to iron out issues like what “privacy” means in light of the law. “Smoking in your own
home is fine,” she said. “If someone wants to
grow it in their kitchen, the judgment covers it. It has to be a small portion
and cultivated only for personal use and for smoking in private.” She also advised
against smoking zol in public, as the judgment does not cover smoking in
public. “It is advisable for
the judgment to be interpreted quite restrictively,” she said. She also warned
against citizens taking selfies of themselves smoking in public. “This could open them
to prosecution,” she said. “We can imagine that
parliament will provide further details as the Court is expecting guidelines
from parliament as to the issue of regulation,” she said.
