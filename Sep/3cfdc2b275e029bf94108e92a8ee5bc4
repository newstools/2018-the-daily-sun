STATISTICS about youths infected with sexually transmitted diseases and sexually transmitted infections are alarming. This is because of the rate at which young people are engaging in unprotected sex. One of the biggest reasons for this is that it is almost impossible to live without sex and abstain. This encouraged Refentse Seleti (26) from Mokopane in Limpopo to host a seminar called #ASIJIKI, A Call for Purity. The campaign promotes the idea of sexual purity to the youth. The theme of the seminar is called: “Putting on the cloak of righteousness in the city” and will be hosted at the Calvary Christian Church at Menlyn, Pretoria in Gauteng tomorrow. Refentse said she decided to host the seminar after seeing how sexually immoral the youth had become and how recklessly they engage in sexual activities. “I feel compelled to host this seminar to bring awareness to the youth that it is necessary for them to lead sexually pure lives. “The word of God also encourages the youth to abstain. “We will be discussing about purity, holiness and righteousness. “People should know how to control themselves when it comes to sex. “It is almost impossible to lead a sexually pure life in the absence of Christ, for it is through Him alone that we can do all things,” she said. She said her wish is to have young people rehabilitated in their thinking towards sex and to make virginity a trend.
