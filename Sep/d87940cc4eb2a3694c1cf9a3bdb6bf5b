By now it is no secret that Trevor Noah is a Hollywood star. Not only does he have a high-paying job that has made him a global brand, he also gets to attend the most exclusive events on the planet, he hangs out with the biggest names in entertainment and they are as much a fan of Trevor as he is theirs. The comedian and late night talk show host recently attended Rihanna’s fourth annual Diamond Ball which closed off New York Fashion Week in style. The Diamond Ball is a charity gala event that raises money for Rihanna's Clara Lionel Foundation which supports health and education initiatives in the Caribbean and Malawi. Only the most rich and powerful make it onto the guest list each year. This year’s gala was hosted by actress, comedian and creator of the HBO series, Insecure, Issa Rae and had performances by stars such as Childish Gambino. Our very own Trevor Noah managed to crack himself an invite for the second year in a row now and got to rub shoulders with, among others, Rihanna, Meek Mill, and Tiffany Haddish. Trevor wore a stunning, double-breasted Balmain suit to the occasion. “Apart from being a nonstop hit machine one of the things that makes Rihanna a superstar is how passionate she is about helping those in need, especially children without access to education. At the Diamond Ball we get to dress up and have fun while raising a ton of money for a great cause. Thanks for having me Rih,” said Trevor.

Ps: We're also birthday twins which is probably part of why she's so amazing??.
