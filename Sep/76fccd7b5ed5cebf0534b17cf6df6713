MZANSI, it’s time to shine a spotlight on our teeth and gums again for National Oral Health month. According to Sarie Liebenberg, an oral hygienist, about eight in 10 people suffer from gum disease. Two of the most common gum diseases are gingivitis and periodontitis. Gingivitis is the inflammation of the soft tissue around the teeth, but where the bone around the teeth is not as yet affected. It can be cured without leaving permanent damage to the gums. It can lead to periodontitis if it’s not treated. It’s the inflammation of the soft tissue around the teeth that also leads to the loss of the supporting bone structure around the teeth. It can be stopped if treated, but the damage to the bone structure may be irreversible. Losing all your teeth may not be the most horrible outcome of periodontitis. “Everybody has a whole ecology of bacteria in their mouths called oral flora. Oral flora is made up of good bacteria and bad bacteria. As long as there is right arrangement between the good and bad bacteria, your mouth is healthy. But when certain types of bacteria take over the oral ecology, disease is produced. “This is why we need to brush our teeth twice a day and floss at least once a day,” said Liebenberg. Gingivitis is easily recognised. It makes your gums red and swollen and bleed easily when you brush your teeth. “To treat gingivitis, you need to remove the plaque, the mush that builds up on your teeth. It’s the waste produced by bacteria-eating sugar. “And calculus, the hardened or calcified plaque, on the teeth and underneath gums. No brushing or gargling with mouthwash will remove hardened plaque with brushing anymore. A dental hygienist or dentist needs to scrape it away with specialised instruments.” While gingivitis can come and go quite quickly, periodontitis develops over years. Unfortunately, because periodontitis doesn’t always present with pain, it can grow worse without the sufferer realising anything is wrong until it’s too late.
