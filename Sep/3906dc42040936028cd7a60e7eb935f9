THE IFP has finally dismissed controversial Endumeni mayor Siboniso Mbatha and municipal speaker Bongiwe Mbatha-Makhathini. The news was confirmed by the party’s national spokesman, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, yesterday. He said the party’s national leadership met on Tuesday and decided the two needed to leave their positions for the KZN municipality to function properly. Hlengwa said Mbatha was also fired as a councillor. “The party has been monitoring the progress of the municipality since 2016 to check whether our officials are carrying out the responsibilities the party entrusted them with,” he said. “We have noticed that the mayor and the speaker have not been seeing eye to eye and we felt the squabbles between them were affecting the work they were supposed to be carrying out. Our decision was in the best interests of the residents of the municipality.” Although Hlenga said the pair were notified of the decision on Wednesday afternoon, Mbatha denied this. He said when he called the party for clarity, he was told not to comment because he had not signed a resignation letter. However, a source within the party said Mbatha was lying as party officials had met him to inform him of the decision. Mbatha and Mbatha-Makhathini have for some time been involved in disputes over the awarding of tenders. In April, Mbatha was arrested for allegedly plotting to have Mbatha-Makhathini killed. The Hawks arrested him along with Langalibalele councillor Mthembeni Majola and an alleged hitman. They are currently out on bail and appeared in the Estcourt Magistrates Court on Monday. The case was postponed to February. The SunTeam tried to get hold of the speaker without any luck.
