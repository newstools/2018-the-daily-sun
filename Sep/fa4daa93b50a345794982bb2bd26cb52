ORLANDO Pirates bounced back to winning ways after beating struggling Baroka FC 2-1 in an Absa Premiership encounter played at Peter Mokaba Stadium yesterday. Bucs came into this clash from a disappointing 2–2 draw with Cape Town City FC in their midweek league clash at Orlando Stadium. But Milutin Sredojevic’s lads were ruthless yesterday in the first half. And it was no surprise when they went into the break leading 2-0 thanks to Vincent Pule and Thembinkosi Lorch. Bucs new signing and on form Pule opened the scoring for the Soweto giants in the 32th minute and Lorch extend the lead five minutes later after poor defending by Bakgaga defence. Baroka did create some chances in the first half, but they were not clinical. Bucs started the second half slow and looked tired with Baroka dominating. Baroka created few scoring chances but they just couldn’t convert them. Their striker Ranga Chivaviro missed a goal scoring chance in the 58th minute inside the penalty box after they caught the Bucs defence sleeping. Baroka’s pressure paid off in the 79th minute with Onkabetse Makgantai scoring a fine ball. Despite putting pressure on Pirates, Baroka just couldn’t find the second goal. This victory have put Pirates on 14 points from eight league matches. And if this is the kind of form Pirates are showing, they can be one of the title contenders this season. Meanwhile, Banyana Banyana successfully defended the Cosafa Women’s Championship with a 2-1 win over Cameroon at Wolfson Stadium in Port Elizabeth yesterday. Refiloe Jane who was the captain of Banyana last year when they won the trophy in Zimbabwe, was at her best yet again as she scored the brace that ensured the title remains in Mzansi. After the great showing in the Cosafa, now the bigger picture is qualifying for next year’s Fifa Women’s World Cup which will be hosted by France.
