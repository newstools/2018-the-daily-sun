NOT even miserable weather could stand in the way of these maidens! Thousands of maidens attended the reed dance at Enyokeni Royal Palace in Nongoma, northern KZN, on Saturday. Even though the harsh weather forced Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to cancel his main address, 35 000 maidens submitted their reeds. The event ran from Thursday until yesterday with the main celebration on Saturday. One of the maidens, Gugu Mkhize (29) from Port Shepstone, said she didn’t mind the bad weather as she understood what it meant to be part of the event. “The reed dance is my pride as an African youth. “We braved the rain and lightning because we know what it means to be virgins and we are proud of it,” said Gugu. She said she started attending the event 10 years ago. “Attending the reed dance was my choice. I was not pushed into it by my parents.” Dolly Masango (28), the maidens’ leader, said while many people looked down on the reed dance, they were unapologetic about it. “We live in tough times where pregnancy among the youth has become common and STDs and HIV infections are high. “Being part of the reed dance means we are safe from these things.”
