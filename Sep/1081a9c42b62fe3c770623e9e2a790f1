ACTING KZN premier Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said fraud and corruption in government would end if public servants familiarised themselves with the public service pledge. Dhlomo was speaking at the launch of the public service commission’s pledge in Durban on Monday. He said government was serious about rooting out corruption. “Many studies have indicated that there’s a negative correlation between investment on one hand and fraud and corruption on the other. While the lack of ethics can benefit a few individuals or groups in the short term, it may have devastating consequences for a province, a country and a continent,” he said. Dr Pearl Sithole, head of the KZN public service commission, said the pledge served as a re-commitment of all public servants to the values and principles of the Constitution.
