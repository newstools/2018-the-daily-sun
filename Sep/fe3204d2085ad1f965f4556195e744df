RESIDENTS marched to the Barberton Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga yesterday to oppose bail in the murder and rape case of accused Nathi Mavuso (24) and Moses Fakude (20). Mavuso and Fakude are accused of raping and strangling 17-year-old Mpilo Nkosi on 31 August. Mpilo had gone to visit friends but never returned. Her rotting body was found a few days later next to a stream. Resident Siyabonga Malandule said: “We’ll continue opposing bail until we get justice for Mpilo. “They don’t deserve to be a part of our community.” Siyabonga said the accused must be locked up. “We don’t want to see them out and we’ll make sure they don’t come back to our community.” The case was postponed to 1 October to allow Fakude to get a lawyer and for further investigations.
