CONTROVERSIAL gqom artist NUZ Queen has promised to give award-winning singer Busiswa Gqulu a beating. Twitter was set abuzz on Monday when Busiswa slammed NUZ Queen for allegedly stealing the Ed Harris song, Laze Lavuka Idimoni Lami, which features Sdudla Somdanso. NUZ Queen tweeted in Zulu: “I must beat you up, granny. No one messes with me. We will meet.” Busiswa responded by telling NUZ Queen she couldn’t fight and would, therefore, beef up her security. She wrote on Twitter: “I see you with the threats, babe, but what about the song you stole? Will you take it down so the original makers can shine?” When the SunTeam contacted Busiswa, she said she didn’t want to talk about the song as it was tiring but confirmed she wanted to improve her security. NUZ Queen, who also announced on Twitter that she was pregnant, couldn’t be reached for comment. However, her manager Sbankwa Nyubuse told Daily Sun people should stop provoking her. “She’s angry and that’s why she loses it sometimes,” he said.
