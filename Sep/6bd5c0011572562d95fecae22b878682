THE legal team of a bishop accused of raping his daughter told the court their client suffered from diabetes and therefore could not get an erection. The 49-year-old bishop appeared in Libode Magistrates Court on Friday to apply for bail. He also told the court he had heart problems and hypertension. Bukelwa Somthunzi, a member of the bishop’s church, told the court she did not believe he was guilty. “The victim had a tendency of disappearing only to return home the next day,” she said. “She has been a troubled child who steals cellphones for as long as I have known her. “She is not an honest person. “Her father was once called to her school after she was caught smoking dagga,” Somthunzi said. Investigating officer Constable Sobabini Mcazulwa said the 18-year-old was scared of her father. “She told me she would rather poison herself with pesticides than have her father out on bail,” he said. “The girl said her father once beat her to a pulp after he saw nude photos of her on her phone and he threatened to kill her if she told anyone he had raped her.” The accused’s stepdaughter also laid a charge of indecent assault against him. Prosecutor Fezile Makunga said if the accused was released on bail, there was a possibility he would interfere with witnesses because he knew where they lived. Magistrate Nwabisa Jumba postponed the bail judgment to next Thursday. The accused will be held at Wellington Prison’s medical section until then.
