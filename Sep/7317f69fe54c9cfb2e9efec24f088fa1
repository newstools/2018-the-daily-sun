COPS from around the province were on high alert in Soweto yesterday after the spate of looting of foreign-owned shops in the kasi. The looting started in White City on Wednesday, but quickly spread to other areas such as Braamfischer, Dobsonville, Orlando East, Meadowlands and Mofolo. Police told Daily Sun that residents in Kagiso, Mogale City tried to loot foreign-owned shops, but they were prevented. There were reports that looting had also spread to Carletonville as well as to the Vaal. Three people were confirmed dead by police, while some were injured. The outbreak of looting was caused by claims that foreign shop owners were selling expired food to residents. One foreign shop owner allegedly shot and killed a young man during looting in White City on Wednesday, which led to more chaos in the area. Shop owners ran for safety to different places including cop shops. One of the shop owners, Mohammed Ayele, spoke to the People’s Paper from the Moroka cop shop. “This is really not fair,” he said. “Why are they doing this to us? This is pure criminality and the police must deal with it.” Police spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said 27 people were arrested. Three spazas were found not to have complied with health regulations required in the handling of food. Jerry Chaka, head of the environmental health unit, said some spazas would be locked and the food taken for testing. Acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Lebeoana Tsumane condemned the incidents. He commended the police’s swift response to try to stabilise the situation and prevent more attacks.
