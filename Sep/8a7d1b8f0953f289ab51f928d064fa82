FOUR suspects, including three pupils, were arrested for stealing. The four allegedly stole 25 laptops and a printer from Orhovelani High School in Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Friday night. Two of them are grade 11 pupils at the school. The third is a grade 11 pupil from Mafemani Nxumalo High School. Police swooped on them and recovered the goods hidden under their beds at their homes in Zola extension, outside Thulamahashe on Saturday. A fifth suspect is on the run. The fourth suspect (19) allegedly told police that they overpowered a guard after threatening him with an iron bar. Then they broke into the principal’s office, opened the safe and took the laptops. “We shared the laptops among ourselves to use for writing music and videos and wanted to sell the rest,” said the pupil. SGB chairman Collen Mathebula strongly condemned the incident. He said the boys stole their own education. Sergeant Abigail Nxumalo confirmed the arrest. She said the suspects faced charges of burglary and would appear in the Mhala Magistrates Court soon.
