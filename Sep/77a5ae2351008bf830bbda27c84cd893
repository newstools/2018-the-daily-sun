KING Shaka Day celebrations will not take place at the weekend. The event was supposed to be held at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, but has been put on hold until next Saturday. The death of King Goodwill Zwelithini’s son‚ Prince Butho, prompted the first postponement, and the recent suspension of train services caused the latest delay. IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said Zulu warriors always travelled by train to the celebrations. Buthelezi said he, Zwelithini and Premier Willies Mchunu agreed to put the celebrations on ice. “We’re disappointed that we had to postpone the celebrations for the second time. Over the past 46 years, we’ve never had to cancel the celebrations,” said Buthelezi. He said he called yesterday’s media briefing in his capacity as the Zulu nation’s prime minister. Buthelezi said he was concerned with how people reacted when they were angry. He said black people were seen as a laughing stock “because they burn things they need to use the following day”. His comments referred to the torching of four cars and a train coach owned by the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa. The arson attack was carried out in response to a train that ran a little later than usual. The company responded to the incident by suspending railway services indefinitely. Prasa announced on Wednesday that trains would start operating again on Monday.
