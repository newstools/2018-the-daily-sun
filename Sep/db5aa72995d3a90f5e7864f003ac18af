AFTER Kholeka’s boyfriend allegedly poured paraffin over her and set her alight, she survived and told her family he did it and he was bust. Daily Sun published her story last Friday after Kholeka Mahlangu (26) from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, suffered severe burns and died on Wednesday. Her stepmum Pearl Mnisi said: “We prayed that she pull through but it didn’t happen.” Kholeka sustained serious burns and her body was swollen. “We’re glad she spoke to us before she died and told us who burned her,” said Pearl. “We hope that he rots in jail. His previous girlfriend left him because he was abusive and possessive.” Shes said Kholeka’s lover often beat her. “He once hit her on the head with an iron. She had a big scar.” The family showed the People’s Paper a photo of the burnt Kholeka lying in hospital. Her whole body was bandaged. “You could see she was in terrible pain. Her brother collapsed when he saw her in that condition.” She said it was scary. Pearl said the boyfriend tried to deny everything, but cops saw burn wounds on his hands and arrested him. She told Daily Sun Kholeka lost her baby earlier this year. “We suspect the baby died from pneumonia because the boyfriend used to fetch them at night.” Constable Justice Ramaube said a suspect was charged with murder and will reappear in court this week.
