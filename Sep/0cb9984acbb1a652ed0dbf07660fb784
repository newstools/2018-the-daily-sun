A
32-year-old man was arrested at a car dealership for possession of an
unlicensed firearm. 

 The
man is expected to appear in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court following his
arrest.  Following the suspect reportedly handed over a firearm that had its serial
number filed-off, to a service consultant for safekeeping. The matter was then reported to the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime
Investigation unit and the man was when he came to collect his vehicle. Maluleke said the firearm will be subjected to forensic analysis to determine
whether it was ever used in the commission of any crime.
