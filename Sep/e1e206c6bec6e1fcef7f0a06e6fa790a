FOR most people, spring is a time to celebrate the fine weather with bright clothing and flowers. But for the Mapolopolo Brothers, it is an opportunity to wear formal clothing that makes them look sophisticated. The SunTeam spotted the young men near Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein. They told Daily Sun they were matric pupils from Tsoseletso High School in Bloemanda, Mangaung. Tshepo Mokhothu (17) from Kagisanong said he loved sophisticated clothing as it inspired him to become a lawyer. “I want to study law, and the profession requires its practitioners to wear sophisticated clothes. My fashion sense inspires me to study hard,” he said. Tshepo said they get compliments from elderly people everywhere they went. “That makes me feel good about myself.” Themba Khusela (18) from Turflaagte said all 17 members of the group loved to look stylish. “We get a lot of support from our parents,” said Themba, who wants to study civil engineering. His mum Evelyn Khusela (49) said her son’s fashion sense reminded her of her youth. “Back in my time, gentlemen wore suits. My son reminds me of those days and I am very proud of him. “No mum wants to give birth to a tsotsi. “We all want our kids to become role models,” said Evelyn.
