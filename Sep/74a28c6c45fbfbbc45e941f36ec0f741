A family is heartbroken following the gruesome killing of their son Richard Tsatfi. The 24-year-old died over R20! Richard was accused of stealing the R20 from a street vendor in Sedibeng section in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, last Sunday. According to the family, he was cornered by residents at a tavern. Richard’s sister Petunia Mashate (32) told Daily Sun residents dragged him to Marikana squatter camp, where he was assaulted with a garden spade and stoned to death. “The incident has traumatised us. He didn’t deserve to die like a dog. I’ll never forgive his killers,” she said. Petunia said her brother was targeted only because he was troublesome when he was drunk. “Maybe some of them held a grudge against my brother and used the R20 incident as an excuse to harm him,” she said. Richard will be buried on Saturday. Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha of Tembisa cop shop confirmed that a murder case was opened for investigation. “We’re asking members of the public with information that could lead to arrests to come forward,” he said.
