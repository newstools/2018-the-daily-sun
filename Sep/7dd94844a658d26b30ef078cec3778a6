SMOKE is still rising from the ruins of burnt buildings following violent clashes in Klerksdorp over the weekend. The situation remains tense after nine people appeared in court on Monday in connection with the ugly scenes. The chaos claimed the lives of two men – a taxi driver and a Nigerian. And now sources close to the action have told Daily Sun the violence and murders were sparked by a magosha. The sources claimed the taxi driver came to have a quickie with the magosha and paid his due. But apparently, a few moments after he left the building, he realised his cellphone was missing. He returned and allegedly spotted the magosha with his cellphone and took it away from her. The magosha screamed to her Nigerian boss who allegedly moered the driver. The boss then allegedly pulled out a knife and stabbed the driver to death. Other taxi operators heard what had happened and went on the rampage, burning and destroying stalls, businesses and brothels belonging to foreigners. Local taxi association leaders refused to speak to the People’s Paper. Leaders from the Nigerians Union confirmed the magosha’s Nigerian boss – who residents claimed was named Condom – had died. The magosha who had allegedly caused all the trouble has apparently gone into hiding. North West Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokwabone said cops had no evidence of allegations regarding the magosha. He said nine people were arrested for public violence and appeared in court on Monday.
