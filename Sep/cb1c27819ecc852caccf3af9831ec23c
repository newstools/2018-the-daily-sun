A KFC advert that shows a BMW 325 popularly known as the
Gusheshe, spinning has been banned from being shown on television. A viewer who saw the ad on television lodged a complaint
with the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA), saying it promotes
or normalises a very dangerous activity in which people have been killed in
South Africa. The ASA Directorate ruled in favoor of the viewer, saying that the nature of the ad is not
one that meets the test for social and educational grounds for showing the
scene. “It is not used, for example, to educate consumers in how
not to drive. Following the reasoning of the rulings cited above, the
Directorate is satisfied that the disregard for safety shown in the commercial
is not reasonable and justifiable,” the ASA Directorate said. The Directorate further added that the ad shows the spinning
happening in a building facility like a vacant warehouse, and not a car racing
arena. “The entire set up looks like an amateur event that has been
put together by amateurs and not like a sporting event. The barriers used to separate the spinning car and the people
watching do not appear to be substantial, and given the very short duration of
the clip, are not immediately obvious to the viewer,” said the ASA.
