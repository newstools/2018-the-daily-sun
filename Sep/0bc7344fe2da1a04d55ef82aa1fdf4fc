ACTIVISTS are outraged after two women were found guilty of trying to have sex together and sentenced to a public lashing. According to the Guardian, the two women, aged 22 and 32, were caned six times each in the Terengganu sharia high court in Malaysia yesterday. They were bust last month being intimate in a car in the conservative Muslim state. They pleaded guilty to attempting lesbian sex, forbidden under Islamic law. They were sentenced to a fine of 3 300 Malaysian Ringitt (about R12 000) and six lashings of the cane. About 100 people watched them being whipped in the courtroom yesterday morning, including members of the public. Thilaga Sulathireh, an activist from the Malaysian rights group Justice for Sisters who was in court on Monday told the Guardian: “The punishment was shocking and it was a spectacle. For all intents and purposes it was a public caning. “This case shows a regression for human rights. Not only for LGBT people but all persons because corporal punishment affects all people.” Human Rights Watch are among rights organisations which had urged the Malaysian government to drop the case, arguing public lashing amounted to torture.
