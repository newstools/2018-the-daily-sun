South Africa says Mzansi is currently number one in the world with Foetal
Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) incidences of 6-29%. Out
of 187 countries, a rate of 111 per 1,000 people are born with the condition in
South Africa. The Department
of Social Development community dialogues of the 9-9-9 Campaign against FAS are
currently underway at the Cacadu Tribal Council in Umtata, Eastern Cape. The
campaign, aims to create awareness about the dangers associated with consuming
alcohol during pregnancy. “We
cannot be leaders in such. We need to be achievers in positive things.
Consuming alcohol during pregnancy is robbing babies of their future and
robbing our communities of even more. Drinking
during pregnancy should be a criminal offence. Women who drink during pregnancy
should be locked up,” Department of Social Development Deputy Minister
Bogopane-Zulu said. Bogopane-Zulu
encouraged communities to share their experiences with FAS at which point an
elderly lady, who has two grandchildren born with FAS, shared her day-to-day
trauma. “My
daughter gave birth to twins some years ago. They both have the condition but
one is worse than the other. You
can imagine how as twins, they are obviously compared to one another all the
time. It is enough that they both have FAS but to now also have one struggling
more than the other makes it unbearable at school and at home. The
FAS dialogues will continue at the Osizweni Special School, in Mpumalanga.
