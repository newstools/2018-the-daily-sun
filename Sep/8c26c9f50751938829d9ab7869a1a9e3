KGOTSO Ntambo (33) said the struggles he faced growing up made him stronger. After his mother died in 2008, when he was only 13 years old, Kgotso was forced to be a parent to his younger siblings. Thi experience gave him courage to open an orphanage. Khotso said it felt good to open his home to help poor and homeless kids. The 33-year-old from Phase 6 in Mangaung formed the group called Kgotso Art Servants in 2011. He teaches young people from his kasi to dance and keeps them off the streets. He told Daily Sun: “I decided to open this group after realising that the crime rate in our kasi was too high. We do theatre productions, music, poetry and gumboots dancing.” The group started with five members and now the number has increased to 15. Kgotso said they also had afternoon classes to help children from grade R to 11 with homework. “We want to develop our young people. We want them to realise that their talent can change their lives. God gave us skills, knowledge and talent. Our future is in our hands,” he said.
