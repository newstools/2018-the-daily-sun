HIS love of easy money led this thug to an ugly death. The incident happened on Thursday at Maungani Zavhavha Village near Thohoyandou. The man allegedly accosted two Univen women students and robbed them of R50. When the women told him they had more cash at home, the thug couldn’t resist and went with them. On their way the students raised the alarm and ran for safety, but the greedy thug was trapped. The community rounded on him and beat him with whatever they could lay their hands on. Cops found his half-naked body on Friday with multiple injuries in the dense reeds near a river in the village. The man is believed to be in his late 20s. A resident said: “We are sick and tired of these hooligans. They don’t deserve to live around people but out there in the wild with animals. “We used to catch them and hand them over to the police but two days later you’d find them roaming the streets.” He said dishing out jungle justice would help deter other robbers from committing crimes. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a murder case was opened but that they hadn’t identified the dead man.
