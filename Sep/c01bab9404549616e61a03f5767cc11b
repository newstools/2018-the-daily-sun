GATVOL residents stormed the councillor’s office on Friday and demanded to see him. They claimed he had been avoiding them since June after they found out he had been given R6 million meant for them. They told Daily Sun their houses were demolished in 2013 to make way for a road to be built linking Amaoti and Tafuleni. They said they were moved into RDP houses and promised they would be compensated. Angry residents of Amaoti, north of Durban, went to the councillor’s office and waited for him to arrive. They said they wanted him to tell them why he hadn’t given them their money. One of the residents, Sibekezelo Mthembu (43), said they were told their compensation would be given to them soon after they moved. “Five years have passed and we still haven’t received it. “We’ve enquired from the departments of transport and human settlements and both these departments told us everything had been finalised and the money given to the councillor.” Sibekezelo said they found out the money was approved in June. “So we went to the councillor and he admitted that indeed the money was in. But now he doesn’t want to give it to us. In July he told us he wanted to have a meeting with us. But we don’t want anymore meetings,” she said. Another resident Sithembile Shangase (45) said since they told the councillor they wanted their money, he’s been avoiding them. “He no longer answers our calls. That’s why we decided to come here,” said Sithembile. Councillor Bongani Qhantsi told Daily Sun: “The compensation was approved and they will get it. But I want to have a meeting with them first to finalise the list of residents who should be compensated,” said Qhantsi. He said the R6 million would be divided among affected residents, according to the value of the homes demolished.
