Popular TV actress, Winnie Ntshaba has opened up about coping with the loss of her mother and the lessons which the sudden death has taught her. Winnies, who is currently playing Mamngadi on The Herd, lost her mother suddenly in November 2017. She recently spoke to TshisaLive and said the ordeal has forced her to restructure her life, focus on herself and her family. "At the moment, I am busy being a mother and taking care of me. Strengthening my relationship with God. After losing our mother in November last year I realized: 'Winnie, you have to take care of you'. I take each day as a gift from God. I've had to really focus on it because with my mother's death it was sudden. Today she was with us then the following day she was gone just like that,” she said. Winnie went on to say that she is now solely focused on what truly makes her happy. “I think every person's superpower lies in really living their truth. To just do you. For the longest time I've struggled with trying to please people at the expense of my peace and my joy. When I realised it, it was a heavy wakeup call... to say 'Hey, it's okay to say no, you don't have to say yes to everything',” she told the publication.
