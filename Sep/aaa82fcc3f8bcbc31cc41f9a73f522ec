A SUCCESSFUL health institution provides all services to its people. That is the realisation made by Job Shimankane Tabane (JST) CEO, Dr Bogosi Moagi. He said upgrades in the hospital included oncology and radiology units. Oncology is associated with the treatment of cancer in the body. Treatment involves chemotherapy and radiology. Radiology focuses on treating illness through radiation. Dr Bogosi said the hospital was looking at including oncology as a response to the patients it received. The treatment was available but not enough for the whole province. According to the doctor, these upgrades and inclusion of oncology treatment were to keep patients within the province. Often patients needed to be transported outside the province to Gauteng, which is also costly for the Department of Health. Said Dr Bogosi: “The radiology services offered by JST include a CAT scan, it’s a fairly old one, but we are looking to replace it with a modern one. “We’ll be able to do more and be able to be quicker. And we have all the specialists we need for that from part-time to full-time. And we’re looking at training our own specialists.” But the hospital doesn’t have an MRI machine, for which the service has been outsourced to Klerksdorp or the George Mukhari Hospital in Ga-rankuwa. These services were initially available at private healthcare institutions. The hospital used to run on a budget of more than R6 million, but it now sits around R4 million, thanks to Dr Bogosi. Other areas to be upgraded in the hospital include the gynaecology and renal units. JST is a patient-referral hospital for the province. Dr Bogosi said all these upgrades could be expected in a three-year period.
