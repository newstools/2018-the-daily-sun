HERE are the top five pieces of information you can find in your vehicle’s manual. Setting up your car The newer a car is, the more likely it is to have advanced technological features. The manual should help you properly set up the features so they can be used properly. Checking the fluids Learn your car’s minimum and maximum oil, brake fluid and water levels. Fixing common problems If you find yourself stranded on the side of the road where help may not be within easy reach, your manual covers in basic terms how to deal with common problems. Correct tyre pressure Even if you know how to operate a tyre gauge you still need to know what your car’s ideal tyre pressure is so you can keep using them safely. Know the warning signs When new lights shine up on your dash, you may be facing a problem that needs urgent attention. Make sure that you are aware of what all the dash lights mean before they surprise you.
