WHEN Siyabonga Mabizela dropped out of school after he became partially blind, he thought he’d sit at home for the rest of his life. But thanks to the Joburg Society for the Blind, he’s a few months away from getting his matric certificate. The organisation’s CEO Nkosana Kubheka (28) told Daily Sun they started a programme to help blind people complete matric after realising that many were missing out on opportunities to go to school. Siyabonga started having serious eye problems when he was in high school. “I dropped out in grade 11 because my vision got so bad. I stayed home for four years doing nothing,” he said. The 28-year-old from Emangwaneni Village in KZN said he moved to Joburg when he was 24 for eye treatment. “Doctors found that I had a condition called retinitis pigmentosa, which I inherited from my parents,” he said. A social worker encouraged Siyabonga to finish matric and referred him to the society. “I will write my final exam in June,” he said. Siyabonga said he wanted to become a social worker so he could help his community back at home. “I want to encourage people to study,” he said.
