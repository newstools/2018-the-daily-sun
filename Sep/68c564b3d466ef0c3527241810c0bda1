Two people were killed when Red BMW crashed into a tree, on
Houtkop Road in Vereeniging. Paramedics reportedly arrived on the scene and discovered
the body of a man lying outside the car. “Unfortunately, the man had already succumbed to his
injuries. Nothing could be done for him and he was declared dead by provincial
services,” ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said. A second patient who is a man, was also assessed and was found
to be in a critical condition. Meiring said the man was treated for his injuries and
provided with advanced life support interventions. Once he was treated, the man was transported to Sebokeng
Provincial hospital for further care. “Unfortunately, after a few minutes in hospital, the man
succumbed to his injuries. Local authorities were on the scene for further
investigations,” Meiring said.
