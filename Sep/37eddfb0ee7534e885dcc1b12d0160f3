THE Hawks arrested seven zama zamas on Friday at an abandoned gold mine in Giyani, Limpopo. The Hawks acted on a tip-off. The suspects were caught at the abandoned mine in Hlaniki Village. About 89 bags of gold-bearing material were seized during the arrest. The seven suspects are expected to appear in the Giyani Magistrates Court today. They face charges in connection with contravening the Precious Metals Act, illegal mining and unlawful possession of unwrought metal. Limpopo Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said: “We managed to arrest seven suspects. However, many ran into the bush the moment the police entered the mine. “We are still going to address this problem in other parts of the province where illegal mining is taking place.” Matimba said the seven suspects are aged between 26 and 60. The gold mine was closed in 2016. In March, the Hawks raided the mine after reports of zama zamas operating there. They seized five vehicles, two generators, mining drills, industrial hammers and a sieve. Again in May, the Hawks held the same operation at Ellerton mine outside Giyani,where 45 suspects were arrested.
