Rapper, TV presenter and now fashion designer, Zulu Mkhathini has teased fans with a glimpse of what to expect from his debut fashion collection. The former Dreamteam member attended the Nedbank International Polo Cup at the Inanda Polo Club in Sandton, Johannesburg over the weekend and wore a suit from his own collection. Zulu arrived at the star-studded polo in a linen, tangerine suit paired with a black, open shirt and black accessories to accentuate. The suit will form part of his Spring/Summer 2018 range. Although he hasn’t revealed the name of the collection, he has said that he is now in a new phase of his life and he feels as though it is only just the beginning of greater things. “The first step is always the hardest, but if you walk in faith you will never put a foot wrong,” the rapper and style star said.
