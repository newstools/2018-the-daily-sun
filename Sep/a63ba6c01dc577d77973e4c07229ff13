A FOREIGNER from Mozambique has lived to tell the tale after he was stabbed more than 10 times. John Zitha, who lives in Allandale outside Ludlow in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, said he couldn’t believe he was alive. The 37-year-old spent days in hospital after he was viciously attacked by two unknown men. John is a trolley puller at Thulamahashe Plaza. He also helps people to load groceries into taxis at the mall and nearby taxi ranks. He told Daily Sun he was on his way from Acornhoek when a taxi dropped him off at Thulamahashe on Friday at about 7pm. “I was rushing to catch a taxi home when a man, his face covered with a balaclava, confronted me,” he said. “He started fighting with me and demanded cash. His accomplice quickly joined in. “They both swore I’d never see the sun rise again as they stabbed me with knives before leaving me in a pool of blood. “But God saved my life after I bled terribly and fainted at a stall on the side of the road. “I still had the R200 cash I had stuffed in my underpants,” he said. Luckily, a Good Samaritan picked him up and rushed him to Thulamahashe Clinic, from where he was transferred to Mapulaneng Hospital.” Sergeant Abigail Nxumalo said police were investigating a case of assault. Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the two suspects who attacked John can contact Mhala police on 013 773 0331.
