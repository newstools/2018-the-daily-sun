RESIDENTS who live near the Golela border in northern KZN welcomed the arrest of nine suspects on Monday. According to provincial police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele, the suspects, aged between 23 and 49, were found with stolen goods. Mbele said on Monday Pongola cops, as well as units from Golela border, and Tracker, received information about one truck and a bakkie waiting for the gate to open at the border. Mbele said the trucks were allegedly loaded with stolen goods apparently being transported to Malawi. “The cops approached the suspects and a search was conducted,” she said. “Officers discovered a stolen vehicle, several stripped motorbikes, bicycles, computers, solar panels, electrical appliances and other items,” said Mbele. She said the motorbikes were allegedly stolen in the Pietermaritzburg area and surrounding areas. “The suspects appeared in the Pongola Magistrates Court on Tuesday. They were charged with possession of stolen property,” said Mbele. Nomvula Sithole (45) said they were happy the cops made the arrest. “We are faced with a high level of border crime in our country, so these arrests will make a difference in our lives. “It will also send a message that cops are on a mission to tackle crime,” said Nomvula.
