Orlando Pirates have secured the services of Brazilian Defender Caio Marcelo Pinheiro da Silva from Nova Iguaçu Football Club in Brazil. The Buccaneers left the signing very late, but managed to get the deal over the line on the final day of the transfer window. The 28 year old “was spotted in Pirates’ recent Project X trip in Brazil, will join his new teammates this week after impressing technical staff during the preseason break,” the club said on their website. Marcelo joins nine other Pirates signings in what was a successful transfer window for the Sea Robbers.
