WHEN Joseph Buthelezi (77) left his home in Tshelimnyama, west of Durban, on 4 September, his family was hoping to see him again on Saturday. Joseph was going to work in Durban North, where he worked as a gardener. But on 6 September his family received a call from the madala’s employer. The employer wanted to know if Joseph was okay as he hadn’t arrived at work. The madala’s stepdaughter, Tholakele Kubheka (32), told Daily Sun they were worried about the madala’s disappearance. “He is not the kind of person who would just go somewhere without telling us. “His routine to Durban North has stayed the same for many years. “He has worked for the same family since he was a young man,” Tholakele told the People’s Paper. She said they’d looked for him at hospitals and government mortuaries, with no luck. “We are praying that we will find him alive.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Mariannhill cops were appealing to residents to help them find the madala. “Anyone with information should call Detective-Warrant Officer Joseph Chiliza on 078 496 1527 or 031 791 3206. They can also call 08600 10111,” said Mbele.
