FOUR suspects aged between 26 and 48 briefly appeared in Delmas Magistrates Court. They were charged with public violence and possession of stolen property on Friday after a truck carrying lamb carcasses was hijacked. They were arrested after protesters had barricaded the road with burning tyres, stones and other objects, demanding service delivery last week. But it went from a protest to a robbery in a matter of minutes. Protesters turned into thugs and hijacked a truck carrying lamb carcasses. The action went down as residents of Delmas in Victor Khanye Municipality, Mpumalanga barricaded the N12 between Bapsfontein and Delmas on Thursday morning. Protesters helped themselves to the meat and ran home to hide it on the roofs of their shacks and in toilets. Police spokesman Mtsholi Bhembe said police arrived at the scene shortly after the truck was hijacked and robbed and launched a manhunt for the thieves. “The protesters barricaded the N12 towards Delmas with burning tyres because their electricity had been cut by Eskom. “They subsequently hijacked and robbed a truck with 30 lamb carcasses inside,” he said. “Police launched a manhunt and started searching the nearby settlement and nine carcasses from nearby homes were seized. “Three of the carcasses were found hidden underneath bushes, four were seized on top of house roofs and one was in a toilet.” Three men were released on R500 bail each and will appear in court again on 9 October.
