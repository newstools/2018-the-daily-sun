NEW Chippa United head coach Eric Tinkler is satisfied with the response he got from his players at training during the two-week Fifa break. Tinkler joined the Port Elizabeth side two weeks ago and has been in charge for only one game, an Absa Premiership clash with his former team, SuperSport United, which Chippa lost 2-1. But the former Bafana Bafana midfielder said he was impressed with the attitude and commitment his charges have shown during the break. “The break has been good. It gave me time to have a good look at the boys and enforce the way I want them to play,” said Tinkler, who replaced Dan Malesela. “The only problem we have is that we did not play as many friendlies as I would have preferred. “We are in Port Elizabeth and there are not many PSL and NFD teams nearby that we can arrange friendlies with. But I am happy with the preparations we’ve made during this break.” The Chilli Boys are currently bottom of the standings with one point from a draw with Black Leopards and have lost three games. They are equal on points with Fadlu Davids’s Maritzburg United, who are one position above them with a game in hand. But Tinkler remains optimistic: “We have a good, strong team capable of moving up from our current position. It is just a matter of time before we’re out of this spot.” Chippa host Baroka FC in their next league match at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Saturday (3pm).
