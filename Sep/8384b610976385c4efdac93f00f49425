WHEN pipes in the municipal sewer manhole burst, it created a nightmare. Hosea Sono (58) put up a fence at his home in Sonop, Madibeng to prevent kids from falling in but he’s been unable to stop the sewage flowing into his yard. Desperate Hosea asked Daily Sun to visit him after the sewer pipes burst in 2016 and he visited and wrote letters to Madibeng Municipality. “Workers from public works said if I wanted their help, I’d have to pay R560.” He refused and paid a private plumber, to learn the pipes had to be reconnected. Hosea said he last spoke to the municipality about the issue early this year and was told his house wasn’t on their map. Municipal spokesman Tumelo Tshabalala said the demand for payment could have been because the pipe was in a private yard and said public works was responsible. Pressed by the People’s Paper, he promised to speak to the director. After the SunTeam’s questions, Hosea phoned usto say a manager visited him. The pipe is the municipality’s responsibility and he is awaiting work on it.
