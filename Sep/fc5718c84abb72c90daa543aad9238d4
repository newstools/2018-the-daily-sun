WHEN mother had a fist fight with her long- time friend, her two-year-old daughter was injured instead. During the fight last Saturday in Jabulani, Soweto, one of the women allegedly grabbed the other woman’s daughter by the foot and banged her head on the concrete floor. The child ended up with bruises, her mouth was cracked open, and she had to have stitches. She couldn’t eat for two days. The mother told Daily Sun her fight with her best friend started because of stockings. “I borrowed stockings from a neighbour, but my friend told me not to take them.” She borrowed the stockings anyway, which made the friend angry. “She grabbed the stockings from me. I took them back and she pushed me. I pushed her and that’s how the fight started,” she said. She said when the friend realised she was not winning, she went for the child. “She held my daughter by a leg and hit her on the floor.” Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng said an assault case was opened and cops were investigating.
