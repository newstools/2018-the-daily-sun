THEY have been living with leaking sewage since 2012! And there is sewage in both town and kasi. Now residents of Bethulie, Free State are sick and tired of the foul smell and said the bucket system was way better. One of the residents, Thabang Mosiako (62) said there is kak everywhere in the area. “Our area is like a dump site. I cannot allow my grandchildren to play outside after school. I am worried sick they might get sick. Politicians are not doing anything to make sure we stay healthy.” Another resident, Tahleho Jas (52), said the bucket system was way better than the unhealthy leaking sewage. “It gets into our yards and blocks our doors. Some people can’t get into their houses. With the bucket system, we knew how to bury the waste. Now the sewage is threatening our health.” Maria Sempe (45) said she stopped going to church as there is sewage all over the yard. Kopanong municipality spokesman Solomzi Phama said they were aware of the problem and have sent a team to the area. The municipality has asked for funding to replace sewage pipes.
