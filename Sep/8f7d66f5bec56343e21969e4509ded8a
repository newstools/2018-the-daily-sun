THERE are many important things we drivers take for granted whenever we get behind the wheel. Because we have a licence and can steer a car, we assume we know everything there is to know about driving but this is how our arrogance gets us into trouble. Even basic features such as adjusting the seat to support your height and weight is often taken for granted and later ignored. AutoTrader and Jaguar Land Rover Driver Trainers want to remind Mzansi drivers that not sitting up straight while driving is the root of many problems such as severe back pain that can later affect your driving and lead to crashes. George Mienie, CEO, of AutoTrader, said that modern cars can automatically detect a driver’s height and weight and position the protection system to suit the individual measurements. “This makes it important for drivers to adjust their driving position and make sure they drive while correctly positioned in the safest part of the cabin.” He also said, while it may take time for drivers to get used to a new sitting position, it can save their lives in an accident.
