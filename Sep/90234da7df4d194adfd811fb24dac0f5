BY the time they found the camera hidden in their shower,
their flatmate had collected more than 100 films and images of them naked. And he admitted that he used them as his personal porn! According to Global Nation, the unnamed 41-year-old
Filipino clerk had installed the camera in the ceiling of their shared bathroom
as far back as December 2017.In August, one of his female roommates spotted the suspicious object on the
ceiling and called her fellow female roommates. They took it down and examined what was on the camera’s
memory card. To their horror, they discovered a ton of photos and
videos of themselves naked in the shower. Furious, they confronted their male roommates. An unnamed cop explained to Gulf News: “During
questioning, the suspect admitted that he had filmed his flatmates naked in the
shower. “When asked why he did so, he alleged that he used to
film them nude and watch the content to please his sexual desires.” His roommates have laid a complaint with the cops who are
investigating.
