THE departure of Siphiwe Tshabalala to join Turkish side BB Erzurumspor has brought belief on the journey of marksman Bradley Grobler. The SuperSport United and Bafana Bafana striker who turned up against Libya yesterday, says he wants to follow in the footsteps of the 33-year-old, if he stays injury-free this season. Said Grobler: “It’s never too late, and Shabba for me is a perfect example. He has proved that to everyone after leaving for overseas at his age. “It shows that age is nothing but a number. There’s still hope that I can still make a move abroad. Age is not on my side, I’m not old and I’m not young either. If I stay injury-free and continue working hard, there’s hope.” The 30-year-old has played overseas before for Turkish club Goztepe FC and spent better half of last season on the nursing room. He only managed to play 12 matches in all competitions. The striker has already scored three goals and all of them in the MTN8. He has yet to open his league account, but has promised to do so when he returns from his Bafana Bafana duties. “Injuries have been a setback and major delay in my career in the past seasons,” Said Grobler. “Right now, I’m happy I’m fit again and in my best feeling. My focus now is to make sure I look after myself and stay injury-free. “When I came back this season from a lengthy lay-off, it was important to get that first goal. Now, I’m looking to continue with my scoring form for my team and also open my account in the league.” Grobler’s latest goal helped Matsatsantsa a Pitori win over Kaizer Chiefs last Saturday to reach MTN8 final for the second consecutive season. That goal put United in pole position to defend their title against Cape Town City who they beat in the final last year. On Saturday, Grobler will be expected to wear his scoring boots when United visit Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium (8.15pm).
