The Animal Anti-Cruelty League has asked witnesses to come forward with information following two separate incidents during which animals were attacked. The first incident involves a dog that was hung from a tree. In a video clip sent to the league a few months ago, the dog is seen hanging from a tree by its neck. All attempts to trace witnesses and the person who sent the video have failed. The second incident involves a pig that was apparently beaten with blunt objects at an open field on Lodewyk Street in Bloemendal, Port Elizabeth, on 10 August. Anyone with information should contact the league on 041 456 1776, Karien Van Schalkwyk on 079 667 8667, or Beverley Rademeyer on 082 654 2852.
