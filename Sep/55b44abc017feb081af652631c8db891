TRADITIONAL healers say their muthi can cure all kinds of ailments. But their trade poses a threat to endangered animals and plants. The environmental affairs department held a workshop for muthi traders and sangomas in Ulundi on Tuesday. The workshop, in partnership with KZN Wildlife and the Ulundi and Pongola municipalities, was aimed at promoting compliance with environmental laws. The department received complaints about the illegal sale of protected species at muthi markets. Before the workshop began, department representatives visited Mona Muthi Market in Nongoma. Sangoma Jabulani Sangweni said: “I don’t kill animals. I buy the parts I need from people who kill them.” Bhekuyise Buthelezi, the muthi market’s spokesman, said about 3 000 traders did business at the venue. “We’re grateful for the department’s engagement,” he said. “But they haven’t come up with a solution yet. “We were told to form a committee that would meet the department and discuss solutions to the problem.” Deputy director of compliance Sifiso Miya said the department was conducting awareness workshops aimed at teaching muthi traders about environmental laws. He said plans were in place to monitor such markets around the country. “If that doesn’t change behaviour, law enforcement will follow,” Miya told Daily Sun.
