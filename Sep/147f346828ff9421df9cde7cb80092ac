MOJELA Selebalo’s shack caught fire on Saturday night. His son Molefi (5) and friend Sebolelo Khoarane (11) ran away when they realised the shack was on fire. Concerned residents launched a search on Sunday night. Not only did they help to find the missing children, they are now helping Mojela to rebuild his shack. Daily Sun published the story, titled “Missing kids found safe”, on Tuesday. When the SunTeam arrived in Caleb Motshabi in Mangaung yesterday, Mojela was all smiles. His neighbours were building him a shack. But it couldn’t be built on the old stand. He will now stay three houses away from his old yard. Mojela told Daily Sun: “I’ve never seen residents as united as these ones. I’m honoured to be a part of this community. “We have the spirit of ubuntu. I wish we could continue to help each other. “I’m grateful and want to thank my neighbours for helping us find our children.” One of the neighbours, Peter Ramatlama (32), said they tried to put out the fire but the blaze was too strong. “We decided to help him. He’s a single parent who loves and cares for his children,” he said. “Boards and poles were donated and some women will also give him some blankets. “He deserves to be assisted because he’s unemployed.”
