THE annual Standard Bank Joy of Jazz kicked off last night with performances dedicated to the late Hugh Masekela. Khaya Mahlangu and young artists, Sthe Bhengu and Mthunzi Mvubu performed as part of the Horn Summit in memory of the legendary trumpeter. Tonight will be Gloria Bosman’s turn to set the stage on fire with a fun, playful performance. Gloria said she’s been performing at the event for the past 15 years. She said she planned to bring something different this year. “Although I’ve been performing at the jazz festival for years, it will be the first time that I’ve performed at the Convention Centre by myself.” She said she had collaborated with other artists in the past. “I’m honoured. It’s a great milestone for me to be part of the growth of the Joy of Jazz, which is celebrating 21 years of existence.” The Soweto-born star said people can expect to hear some new music. “I’m excited to perform new songs and revisit old ones. I want to give people that nostalgic feeling. I will also be bringing new elements to the performance as I’ll play the guitar. “People haven’t seen me doing that. I’ll also perform with a DJ. I want it to be colourful and fun and for people to enjoy the performance.” The Amaqwati hitmaker said it was vital as a musician to keep up with the latest trends as they make one’s sound more youthful. “The beauty of working with young musicians is that they play music for the sake of music and nothing else. “That’s the inspiration behind my new album called Rhythm of my Soul, which I’ll be releasing in December.” Gloria said she started a concept on social media called “A Song a Minute”. “This is where I post videos on social media of a new song that I’ve written that minute.” Her two singles, Amaswidi and Ndiyanqonqoza, are available on all digital platforms.
