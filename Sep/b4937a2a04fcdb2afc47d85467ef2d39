ANDISWA Ndibi (33) dumped her ex-boyfriend because he cheated on her with other women. But now he’s allegedly kidnapped her two children and told her to take him back – or lose her children! Andiswa, from Tshepisong near Kagiso, told Daily Sun she’s gripped with fear and doesn’t know whether her children are safe. She believes her ex-boyfriend from Mozambique has kidnapped her two children Elami (8) and Muzi (7). A case of kidnapping was opened at Kagiso Police Station. Andiswa said her kids disappeared after she left them playing with other children last Friday. “I was inside the house cooking and when I came out they were gone. “Their friends said my ex-boyfriend told my children to get into his car,” said Andiswa. “When I contacted him, he told me they were with him and that I wouldn’t get them until I took him back.” She said she went to Kagiso cop shop to open a case of kidnapping. Cops are looking for him. “I can’t sleep at night because I don’t where my children are and what they’re eating,” she said. “I’m praying day and night for God to protect them.” She said the man’s cellphone had since been silent and that she didn’t know whether he was even still in the country or not. Captain Solomon Sibiya said a case of kidnapping was opened and cops were looking for the kids and a man called Sergo Vilankulu.
