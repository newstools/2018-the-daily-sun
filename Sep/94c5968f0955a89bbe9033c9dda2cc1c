POWER FM has parted ways with Power Perspective host JJ Tabane following his suspension last week. He was suspended after using the station as a platform to apologise to former Government Communication and Information System acting director-general Phumla Williams for his conduct during the time he worked for former communications minister Faith Muthambi. The news was announced yesterday by station manager Bob Mabena, who said they had considered events that led to Tabaneâ€™s suspension, as well as later events. The station said Tabane had broken his contract with Power FM, which made it impossible to continue its relationship with him. Mabena said the termination was related to his on-air apology at the beginning of the month, which came after Williams testified at the state capture inquiry. Mabena said Tabane had been told of the termination. His replacement would be announced after the recruitment process was completed. Attempts to reach Tabane yesterday were unsuccessful.
