TOP Free State fighter Tello “King Razor” Dithebe says he will be out to prove his victory over Rofhiwa “War Child” Maemu was not a fluke when they clash in a much anticipated grudge rematch at Meropa Casino in Polokwane on 21 September. Dithebe, from Kroonstad, beat the Soweto-based Maemu on a split decision in Bloemfontein two years ago to capture the World Boxing Federation (WBF)intercontinental featherweight crown. He will now be challenging for the World Boxing Association (WBA) Pan African featherweight title. This will be Maemu’s third title defence since winning the vacant WBA Pan African featherweight crown when he beat Namibia’s Emmanuel Andeleki on a unanimous points decision in Gaborone in October last year. The two local featherweight kings will headline a six-bout tournament presented by Fox Sports Africa Boxing, featuring two WBA Pan Africa title fights. According to the former WBF intercontinental champion, victory is very important to get to the top again. He lost his last two championship contests on unanimous point decisions to Khanyile Bulana, for the vacant SA belt in July, and Sakaria Lukas, for the World Boxing Organisation Africa crown in Windhoek last December. “After those defeats I have to win to improve my record,” said Dithebe. “I have beaten Maemu before and I will do it again to show it was not luck. This fight will be tougher, he wants revenge.” Dithebe’s mentor, veteran trainer Moeketsi “Spider” Hlalele, said his charge would live up to his nickname of Razor, displaying sharpness against the tough champion. “Dithebe is very fit, his level of fitness scares me! This contest will definitely be a nail-biting thriller, we are prepared for a real battle,” said Hlalele. “We know the champion will bring the fight to us, on our side we’re ready for whatever he throws at us.”
