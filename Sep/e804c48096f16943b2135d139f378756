GOGO Johanna Mukoti’s is still shocked by the strange visitor she had at her home. The visitor came out of nowhere and ransacked the 68-year-old’s house. The unwelcome visitor was a baboon! The incident took place in Tsianda Village in Mashamba, Limpopo on Tuesday morning. Gogo Johanna said she was alone at home when the baboon just barged in unannounced. “I was preparing a hot bath. I went out of my room and came face-to-face with this monster. “I ran outside and the baboon proceeded to my sitting-room, where it broke furniture and other items,” said the gogo. She said a neighbour screamed for help and the police and nature conservation officials were called. “They killed the hostile animal,” said the shocked gogo. “Had I not run outside, this monster could have killed me. “The worse part is that it left a trail of destruction. My furniture and other items were broken by this angry creature. Replacing these items will be hard.” Councillor Saddam Masutha said he had never seen a baboon trash a house before. “The community is still shocked as this is very unusual,” he said. Vhangona Indigenous Health Practitioners president and traditional healer, Matamba Mamuremi, said the baboon was a bad omen. “The reason for this is twofold. It could be the work of an evil person or the gods trying to show people that they are not following their ancestors’ instructions.”
