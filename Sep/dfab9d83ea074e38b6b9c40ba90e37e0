THE father of the two daughters arrested for child negligence said he warned them not to leave their children alone at night. The sisters, Nelisiwe Fihlani (28), and Bongiwe Ngobeni (31) from Alexandra, northern Joburg, were arrested after they left their five children at home to go drinking on Sunday. The house caught fire, but one of the children managed to escape and call for help. Three siblings Mbali (6), Nonhlanhla (7), Amukelani Fihlani (2), and their cousin Sandile Ngobeni (4), died in hospital. Daily Sun published the story yesterday. Madala Simon Ngubani (67) told Daily Sun: “This happened not long after I reprimanded them and said they shouldn’t leave the children locked in the house at night. “They promised that they would never leave them alone again. It is now clear that they didn’t listen.” The sisters appeared in the Alexandra Magistrates Court to answer to four counts of culpable homicide. The matter was postponed to next Friday. They were kept in custody. The sad madala said neighbours also warned the sisters about their behaviour. “They even called the cops, who talked to them,” he said. Madala Simon said they are hurting as a family. “I had high hopes and big dreams for my grandkids. I was hoping they would grow up to be doctors or teachers, but they didn’t get the chance to reach the goals I had for them.” Gauteng Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza said her department will assist the family with food and counselling. “We will support the family and the 14-year-old who survived.”
