Research from the Northwestern University and UCLA found
that Viagra helped women orgasm by increasing their blood flow, though it did
not treat their emotional desire for sex. Since the elusive female orgasm is mostly mental, they were
still barking up the wrong tree, or, make that the wrong plant. According to a recent survey, the cure for a lagging female
libido might be zol. HelloMD, the “leading digital healthcare platform for the
cannabis industry,” asked 1,400 medical marijuana patients in California about
their use and weren’t too stoned to crunch the numbers. Fatherly.com says they didn’t specifically ask subjects if
they used weed for sex, but 14 percent reported using it to enhance their sex
lives and 47 percent used it to improve their mood, seemingly a turn-on for
everyone involved. While more men are using weed than women (64% vs 36%), women
beat out men when it came to using it for sex (8% versus 4%). If nothing else, having the conversation will remind her you
care about her sexual experiences as much as your own, which will come in handy
if you ever want her to share her weed with you.
