REFUGEES have told countless times of fraud, corruption and the assaults they endure at the refugee office in Marabastad, Tshwane. Officials and cops were allegedly involved. Parliament’s portfolio committee on home affairs has finally woken up to the human rights abuses. Its members’ visit on Friday came hot on the heels of Gauteng DA leader John Moody’s June visit. Committee members said the visit was aimed at assessing progress made since last year’s launch of the automated asylum system. Committee chairman Hlomani Chauke said they had received reports that security around the area had not improved. Officials were apparently involved in crimes taking place at or near the office. Chauke said the committee would advise Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba and security cluster ministers on how to find solutions. “It’s unacceptable that cops are alleged to be contributing to the challenges. “It’s also concerning that people are mugged in full view of police.” He called for harsher action against officials found to be working with syndicates to undermine the system. Chauke told Daily Sun lifestyle audits on officials must be implemented. He said the committee welcomed the collaboration between the department and the United Nations Refugee Agency. Chauke said Refugee Appeal Board backlogs were being dealt with, as a result of the collaboration.
