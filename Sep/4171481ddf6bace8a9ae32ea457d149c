THE Secretary General of the South African National Funeral
Practitioners Association of South Africa (Nafupa) Nkosentsha Shezi was
violently removed out of a meeting on Sunday. Shezi was removed out of the 4th Industrial Revolution
Business Breakfast held in Pietermaritzburg, by what seems like security guards. Those who witnessed the assault, say Shezi was removed when
he stood up to address Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, who was the keynote
speaker at the event. Before Shezi was forcefully removed, he shouted “Asim’funi”
(we don’t want him), when Professor Tshilidzi Marwala referred to Gordhan in his speech. According to The Witness, Shezi said he was against Gordhan
“Behaving as if he was the president.” Shezi added that Gordhan is against the principle of radical
economic transformation. However, Gordhan continued with his speech, undeterred. He
said South African is nowhere near what is required to match other African
countries.
