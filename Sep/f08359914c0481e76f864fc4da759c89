THREE men were bust with bags of drugs on Friday morning. The Hawks received information about men moving drugs in the Polokwane CDB, Limpopo. The suspects, aged between 23 and 29, were driving a blue City Golf when they were arrested. They allegedly told police they were selling drugs in the CBD and surrounding areas of Limpopo. The Hawks confiscated 36 bags of dagga, rock drugs and nyaope with an estimated street value of more than R500 000. They also found R12 000 in cash in the suspects’ possession. Captain Matimaba Maluleke, a spokesman for the Hawks in the province, said: “The success came as a result of an intelligence driven operation where our team went straight to the warehouse at an industrial site in Polokwane.” He said the suspect appeared on Monday in the Polokwane Magistrates Court on a charge of dealing in drugs. Maluleke said more arrests would be made soon. “Our investigations should lead us to where the dagga is being planted and who the buyers are in and around Polokwane.”
