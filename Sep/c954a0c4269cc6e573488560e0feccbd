GATVOL residents of Despatch, Eastern Cape protested against the high number of brutal killing of innocent people by thugs in their area. The residents protested outside the Uitenhage Magistrates Court yesterday, where a murder suspect was applying for bail. Vukile Njoka (34) faces six charges including murder, three of attempted murder, a robbery charge and possession of a dangerous weapon. The case was postponed to 24 October. Njoka was kept in jail. The suspect was allegedly in the company of four armed men who robbed a tavern in Kayamandi on Sunday night. They allegedly shot dead a man in full view of other patrons for answering his cellphone. A witness (29) told Daily Sun: “I saw the four criminals as they entered the tavern and realised they didn’t live in our area. I was with my sister, our friends and the dead man. They forced us to lie down while they ransacked the tavern for money and alcohol. “When the dead man put his hand in the pocket to answer his phone, the thugs shot him several times in the chest and he died instantly. My sister and two friends sustained bad injuries. They are recovering in hospital.” Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said: “The suspects allegedly pointed at an employee with a firearm and demanded money and liquor. As the robbery took place, a man (24) was shot multiple times in the chest. Four women were slightly injured by stray bullets. One suspect was arrested.” He said the stolen cash and liquor were recovered by police.
