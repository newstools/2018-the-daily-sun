PUPILS at Moefi High School in Mabalstad, outside Rustenburg in North West, said they feared going to school. Many of them had to be fetched by teachers from the gate. Three pupils and the principal were removed on Monday by parents and community members. The pupils were accused of being satanists while the principal was accused of not dealing with the issue. Despite what the SunTeam had seen, North West Education spokesman Freddy Sepeng said yesterday: “Everything is back to normal.  The principal is back.” Sepeng said the actions of the parents and community members were merely based on suspicion. He said they should have contacted the department and reported what was happening instead of shutting down the school. “The department would have investigated,” he said. The SGB apparently only became aware on Monday that the principal failed to call a meeting to discuss what was allegedly happening.
