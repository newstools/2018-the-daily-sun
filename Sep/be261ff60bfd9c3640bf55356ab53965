THERE was drama on Saturday when a man apparently drinking while driving scratched Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane’s car. The MEC was visiting Westbury in Joburg when the man scratched her black Jeep with his bakkie. The man reportedly became rude after being confronted by the MEC and it was found he had a half empty bottle of beer between his thighs. When Nkosi-Malobane asked the man why he was drinking and driving, he claimed the bottle was still full. However, she told cops to arrest him. “He was not arrested for scratching my car but for drinking while driving. It’s not acceptable. “People should know they can’t drink and drive,” she said. After the incident, the MEC and residents continued their planned march against drug dealers and gangsters in the area. Residents prayed at seven spots where people had died due to gang violence and carried a coffin to symbolise how tired they were of burying people every weekend. Bishop Dalton Adams of the Church of Joburg Harvest Times told the SunTeam they were also trying to stop the tradition of holding after tears parties. “These people kill our people and then come back and eat and drink with the very same family who lost a member. We want this area to be safe,” he said. Nkosi-Malobane said her department would help the community fight these crimes. Meanwhile, the MEC engaged with hostel leaders in Soweto and Rand West City yesterday following reports of residents destroying property.
