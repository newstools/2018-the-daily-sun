SEVEN relatives who died in a shack fire last Saturday were buried in Reagile near Koster, North West, on Friday. Premier Job Mokgoro promised the family that government would continue helping them. “We’ll continue providing services to you to make life easier because, as government, we care about your healing process. Your pain is our pain,” he said. “As government, we promise to ensure people live in good houses This is a promise I am making as a leader.” Mokgoro said the deaths made government aware of basic service delivery. “These are hardships we can’t ignore. Let us stand and provide for our people. What has happened here reminds us to be quick in our work and actions to provide for our people,” he said. The family and community members could not hold back their tears when the coffins were taken to the scene of the fire for a short prayer before taking them to their final resting place. The area was cleaned and charred remains put aside. Family member Phistos Kuane was heartbroken. “No words can express the pain I’m feeling as this family is now left with one person,” said Phistos (63). The late Boitumelo Mafoko leaves behind her father, two young sons and husband. Boitumelo’s sons will remain with their granddad. She died in the fire with her four other kids and two grandkids. The family is from Siros in Lehurutshe.
