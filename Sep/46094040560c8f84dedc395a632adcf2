THE case against two Coligny farmers accused of killing Matlhomola Mosweu is expected to wrap up this week. The defence called its witnesses when the trial resumed in the North West High Court in Mahikeng, North West, on Monday. A cellphone specialist disputed allegations that the accused, Philip Schutte (27) and Pieter Doorewaard (34), made calls at the time of the murder. A worker from emergency services yesterday took the stand. Sumaya Rajan testified that emergency staff who attended to Matlhomola did not do a good job. Matlhomola was lying on the ground, bleeding profusely, Rajan testified. She said paramedics only did what she called a “scoop and run”, the most basic form of prehospital trauma care. This, she said, meant the boy was not given medical attention. “He was only turned around and never got the necessary help,” said Sumaya. “The cause of death was asphyxiation, which is lack of oxygen.” She said the patient had compromised breathing. “He was lying face down, and when the body was turned over blood flowed back to the head and heart. That’s when asphyxiation started,” she testified. During cross-examination, prosecutor Advocate Moeketsi Moeketsi asked Rajan whether she was qualified to determine the cause of death. Moeketsi said she was not qualified to dispute the conclusion of a qualified medical pathologist. But she insisted that blood loss, and not neck injuries, was the cause of death. At issue is whether Matlhomola died of neck injuries after he was allegedly thrown out of a moving vehicle. The defence has contested claims that he died from lack of oxygen. The trial continues on Friday.
