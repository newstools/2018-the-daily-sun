CYNTHIA lies awake at night wondering how she’ll get out of the debt her daughter has run up. Cynthia Khumalo (45) from Alexandra, Joburg told Daily Sun that her daughter’s victims come knocking at her door at the end of every month for payment. Accoding to Cynthia, her 25-year-old daughter steals from people in their kasi to support her drug addiction. “Every month end I have to pay people for their stolen items. I end up not having any money for groceries,” she said. Cynthia said her daughter didn’t only steal from the neighbours. She also stole her mum’s belongings. “If I leave her alone in the house, when I come home I find she has run away with my things,” she said. Cynthia said her daughter started using drugs when she was 14. She also dropped out of school in grade 10. “I’ve taken her to rehab but she only stays there for a week or two and then runs away,” she said. Cynthia said she had thought of taking her own life. “I have small children that I need to take care of. I want people to stop knocking at my door. I need help for my daughter.”
