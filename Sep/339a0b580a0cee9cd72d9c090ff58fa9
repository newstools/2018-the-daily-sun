Our favourite queen of the dance floor, Zodwa Wabantu does not come cheap. It costs no less than R35 000 to have Zodwa doing her famous vosho at your event. The dancer recently posted a video on Instagram in which she could be heard telling her fans about someone who tried to get her for less than her asking price. “’Hi Zodwa Wabantu, I really need you for this small thing I’m putting together,’ whoa whoa whoa, brother I am big, don’t include me in your small things,” she says in Zulu. “And I’m not worried about going out of style, that’s why I work hard now, because I don’t want to start charging less than 35k “I’d rather retire than start charging less than 35k, and unlike other entertainers, I won’t be making multiple comebacks when I am no longer relevant." Zodwa said she would rather go back to her normal life than be booked for R5000. “Know your worth,” she captioned the video, “some people don't respect you until they want to make money off you.” Check out the video below: Know your worth, I have 6 Business friends that i can do Business Favours with.
