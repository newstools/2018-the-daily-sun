ACCORDING to Itsitsa Primary School principal Simphiwe Ulana, respect and discipline are a crucial part of African heritage. “Kids have abandoned the discipline and respect they used to have,” he said. “When we were younger, we knew our elders were addressed as mum or dad, even if they weren’t our biological parents.” The principal of the school in Mfuleni, Cape Town, said a lack of respect for traditional values was the cause of some of the problems being faced at schools. “Teachers are being attacked and killed by pupils. It’s all over the news.” Ulana said it was important to instil a sense of discipline in pupils. “This is not the responsibility of teachers or parents, but society as a whole. We should all come together and see what we can do to prevent teachers from being attacked. “What needs to be done to help parents with unruly kids? The community needs to work together to address the issue.” During the school’s Heritage Day celebrations on Saturday, pupils and teachers performed plays that taught kids about the consequences of misbehaving. “The plays had a good message. The pupils will view life differently from today,” said Ulana. Teacher Nomfundo Mhlebi said: “The recent attacks on teachers are unprecedented. I think parents and teachers have to work together to create a bright future for kids.” Grade 7 pupil Leleti Sondlo (13) said: “We learnt a lot. “If pupils want to have a bright future, they need to respect and love their teachers.”
