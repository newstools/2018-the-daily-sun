The prospect of a Kaizer Chiefs attack comprising Leonardo Castro, Khama Billiat, Lebogang Manyama and Dumisani Zuma is an appealing one to coach Giovanni Solinas. Castro, Billiat and Zuma have all hit the ground running this season and have been amongst the goals and assists. Manyama meanwhile was signed a couple of weeks back and could be in line to make his Amakhosi debut this weekend against his former club Cape Town City FC. Chiefs visit The Citizens on at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Furthermore, Amakhosi could throw in Andriamirado “Dax” Andrianarimanana who was cleared on Wednesday by the football governing body Fifa that he can be registered and play for Amakhosi. Solinas has revealed that the thought of a four-pronged attack excites him, although he does concede that this cannot be done at the expense of an exposed defence. "In my opinion, when Lebo comes in, we can play with Castro, Billiat, Lebo and Zuma," said Solinas after the were knocked out of the MTN8 semifinals by SuperSport United a fourth night ago. "We want to play attacking football, so we must show attacking football. But, it might be a problem after the ball is lost hey, defensively."Yes, this is a challenge, but I like this challenge, I trust this challenge." "We need balance, we need to solve this as a collective. When you play a lot of attacking players, like strikers, we need the strikers to also participate in the defensive job," he said. "Because if they don't participate, we have only six players to recover the ball. Sometimes it's okay, you can recover the ball with six players, sometimes not. "Sometimes you need to drop and be a compact team, but I'm curious with this challenge. I'll wait, I am curious. I am confident. "I am optimistic because in my opinion, Castro, Billiat, Lebo and Zuma can play together. Yes, the problem for us is the defensive job but when we have the ball the problem is also for the opposing team."
