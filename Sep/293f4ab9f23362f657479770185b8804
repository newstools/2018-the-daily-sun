SELINA Moloi is happy that her abusive lover has finally dumped her. The 54-year-old from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, said she received an SMS from her former lover on 15 September telling her the relationship was over. Selina said she met the 55-year-old man in 1985, and it didn’t take long before things turned sour. “He started abusing me emotionally,” she said. “I took it because I thought it would stop. But it just got worse.” When he started physically abusing her, she went to the cops but he wasn’t arrested. “They said we must talk things through.” Things took a turn for the worse in 2004. “He tied my hands with black refuse bags,” said Selina “He poured methylated spirit over me and set me alight. “It was the most terrible thing I ever went through. I thought I was going to die.” A few days later she went to the police. He was eventually sentenced to 10 years in jail. “When he came out, he came straight to me.” He told her he had changed and was attending anger management classes. “I didn’t want him back but he forced matters.” Selina said the violence started all over again. “I went back to the police but nothing changed. My life was a living hell,” said Selina. She even bought a knife to protect herself. “I’m so glad this relationship is over,” said Selina. “I hope he never comes back to harass me again.” She advised women to get out of abusive relationships. The former boyfriend refused to speak about Selina.
