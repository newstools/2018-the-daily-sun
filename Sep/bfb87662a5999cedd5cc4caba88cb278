MZANSI men, beware of getting prostate cancer! A recent study into prostate cancer reveals that South African black men have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer. The reason is that the group has an elevated level of prostate-specific antigen in the blood. This protein, known as a prostate-specific antigen, is produced by normal prostrate cells but also by prostrate cancer cells. One indication of prostate gland cancer risk is elevated levels of the protein. Professor Riana Bornman, senior research professor at the University of Pretoria’s School of Public Health teamed up with Professor Vanessa Hayes, a genomicist from the Garvan Medical Institute for Medical Research in Sydney, Australia. They focused their research on prostate cancer in black Southern African men specifically of Bantu and Khoisan descent. They wanted to discover if there were any links between prostate cancer risk and African ancestry. Their study covered hospitals in Limpopo and Gauteng where 99% of the participants self-identified as black Africans. All the patients were suffering from more aggressive prostate cancer compared to similar studies conducted on other ethnic groups. “The most common risk factors for prostate cancer include African ancestry, being aged over 50 or older and a family history of prostate cancer on the maternal or paternal side. “Because African ancestry is now a known risk factor, scientists have to investigate why African men have a greater risk of prostate cancer,” Bornman said. Black men older than 40 with a family history of prostate cancer or breast cancer in a parent, sibling or cousin should go for regular testing at least once a year, even if there is no reason for concern. All men older than 45 years should know their prostate-specific antigen level.
