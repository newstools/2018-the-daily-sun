“ESKOM is always the first to tell us to pay our bills, but take time when we ask for help. “I’ve had it with their excuses.” Those were the angry words of Themba Zikalala (59) from Klipspruit, Soweto after being without electricity for more than a week. “I called and have been to their offices but can’t get a straight answer as to what the problem is. “All they tell you is that they have logged the call and will send someone to come and look into it. “Well, it’s been a week and whoever they sent is still on their way. “We can’t tolerate this kind of service when we pay their exorbitant prices. We welcomed a baby boy last Thursday and he’s been suffering because of Eskom’s incompetence,” Themba fumed. He said doing simple but essential things like bathing the baby, sterilising his bottle and even keeping the baby warm has become a tedious and expensive exercise. When asked to comment, an Eskom official said:  that the outage was due to an overhead fault that was affecting a few areas in Soweto. “Field Service is aware of the fault and is working on it.“Our customer services have contacted the customer to give him an update.”
