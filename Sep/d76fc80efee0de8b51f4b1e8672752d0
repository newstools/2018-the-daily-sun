TV presenter turned rapper Boity Thulo is having arguably the time of her life right now. The multitalented 28 year-old recently released a single titled Wuz Dat on which she featured Nasty C. The single, her first real introduction to the rap scene, has been well received by Hip-Hop fans who were surprised by how good it was. As a result, Boity has received a number of booking, something that has been a talking point on social media. While most fans on social media are happy for Boity, a few have called into question the hype surrounding her single and the bookings that have come with it. One user suggested that Boity getting so many gigs after just one song does not reflect well on the local rap industry when established rappers like Solo don’t get as many gigs. To his credit, Solo refused to be drawn into the discussion, simply congratulating Boity on her success and challenging himself to create his own gigs. “Boity is doing her thing,” Solo wrote on social media,”the assumption is that people don't wanna see me live I guess... or I'm not crowd pulling. “Truth is it doesn't matter. Put it on me rather. No victim mentality. Putting on my own shows.” Let the fun begin! ???????????????????????? #WuzDatGigGuide #WuzDat #BookedAndBusy ??????????????????????????????The A Team @adeagency ?????? #OwnYourThrone??
