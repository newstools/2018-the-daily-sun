THREE men have been bust by cops for allegedly ripping
out the eyes of an undercover police sergeant before killing him. According to Punch, their plan was to use the eyes to
make a jacket that would make them invisible as they carried out a crafty
theft. One of the men is Ussaini Musa (80), a sangoma. The other
suspects are Abubakar Sani (35) and Abubakar Muhammed (28). Their victim, Sergeant Umana Ishaya, was on special duty
in an undercover operation in Jos, central Nigeria when he was attacked last
week. Sani and Muhammed had allegedly approached Musa about
making them a jacket to turn them invisible because they were planning to steal
a large amount of cash from a house they’d identified. Musa instructed them that to make such a jacket, he would
need the eyes from a living human. On Wednesday, state Commissioner of Police, Muhammadu
Wakili told a press conference: “The suspects have confessed to the crime, each
stating the roles he played. They will be arraigned immediately the
investigation is completed.” The victim’s eyes were among exhibits recovered from the
suspects.
