KATLEHO Mokoena is known as the stick man! This is because he entertains people by walking on giant sticks known as stilts in return for tips from people who enjoy his performance. Katleho told Daily Sun he first learned to walk on stilts while working on a farm in North West. The 20-year-old from Letshalemaduke Village in QwaQwa, Free State, told Daily Sun he loved seeing the world from above. “I worked at an ostrich farm where we used sticks to walk on so we could fix high fences so the birds couldn’t jump over them,” he said. “I fell many times while I was learning but I just kept my head high and learned to do it properly. “I came up with the idea to make a living from this when I saw people walking on stilts in the circus.” Katleho said after he was retrenched last year, he used the money he was paid out to buy stilts and start a youth club. “I get young people together to teach them drama and how to walk on stilts,’ he said. “I decided to hit the streets to raise money and motorists love it. “I bought more stilts with the money I raised. My dream is to have my own company and travel the world.” Katleho said he had received a number of invitations to perform at parties and shopping centres, which was another source of income for him.
