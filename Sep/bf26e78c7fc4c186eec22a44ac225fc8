WAS he murdered during a robbery? Or, as his suspected
killers insist, did banker Michael Lorkohol (47) die because he was cursed by a
cult he had stolen from? These are the questions the Nigerian cops are going to
have to answer, following Michael’s death last week. According to Punch, Michael vanished in mid July. His
remains were found weeks later in the bush outside the capital Abuja, central
Nigeria. Cops then arrested two suspects who had been friends of
Michael’s, Alfred Leonard and Samson Agbo. They were found with his watch,
belt, sandals, bank card and ID. But Leonard insists Michael did not die at his and Agbo’s
hands. He said, “Mike was sick and I was treating him for eight
months. I was giving him medicine because he had a bulging stomach. “He told me that he was in a secret society and begged me
not to tell his family members about it. They know me in his family. I advised
him to go back to the cult and return whatever belongs to them. “He also told me that they had given him an hour to die
on Sunday and he would die. He begged me to kill him but I declined because I
am a Jukun by tribe and it is a crime to kill in my place. “My friend, Agbo, was there when everything transpired.
Mike asked my friend to scratch his back, saying if he didn’t and the hour
given to him to die passed, his daughters would also die.” Cops are investigating.
