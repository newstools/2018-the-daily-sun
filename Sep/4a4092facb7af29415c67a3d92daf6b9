A NEW political party allegedly backed by former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo has been launched. Speaking at a media briefing in Marikana outside Rustenburg in North West yesterday, Mazibuye African Congress president Reggie Ngcobo said they would not be like the ANC. Ngcobo said the party aimed to include traditional leaders, taxi operators and MK veterans. He said it was time for natives of South Africa to pave their own way, and told the crowd minority groups such as whites and Indians were not welcome in the party. Ngcobo said Mahumapelo fully supported the movement but this was not confirmed by the former premier “The relationship between the Mazibuye African Congress and comrade Supra Mahumapelo is simple. He was the premier of North West, not the premier of the ANC,” he said. “He associated himself with radical economic transformation and we believe he has a lot to offer.” Ngcobo said MK veterans had every right to associate themselves with the new party. “When MK veterans were taking part in the struggle, they were not fighting for the ANC. They were fighting for the total liberation of all of us.” He said the party planned to take part in next year’s general elections.
