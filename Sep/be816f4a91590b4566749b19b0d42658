WHEN the 13 men arrived at the Brits magistrates court for the setting of the trial date, they were told the matter would now be heard in the High Court in Tshwane. But their lawyers argued they were previously told by the director of public prosecutions the accused would be tried in Brits. The 13 men are accused of killing and attacking Amcu members in Rustenburg and Brits last year. The union believes the men are masterminds behind killings that took place in Marikana last year. They’ve been charged with conspiracy to commit murder and the attempted murder of the union’s branch chairman, Malibongwe Mdazo. The branch chairman was shot 16 times! The lawyers said the decision to try the case in Tshwane was unfair. The defence lawyers said some of their clients had travelled all the way from the Eastern Cape, only to be told about the postponement. This was to allow the prosecution to prepare a High Court indictment. The court ruled that seven of the accused, who’re being kept in custody, should appear in court on Friday next week for a formal bail application. Those who are out on bail will appear on 21 September.
