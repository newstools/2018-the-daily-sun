ANGRY residents of Tigane in Hartbeesfontein near Klerksdorp, North West, blocked the entrance to the cop shop on Monday afternoon. They demanded the immediate resignation of the station commander and demanded answers to cases which were still unresolved. They were led by Councillor Gabriel Mqikela as they chanted freedom songs and danced in front of the police station. Mqikela told Daily Sun they have had enough of poor service. “We’re always complaining about services in Tigane. A computer was stolen in a school and a 75-year-old woman was raped by four young men. “All these cases were reported to the police but the station commander and police officers did nothing about them,” said Mqikela. The station commander, Colonel Phillias Mpato, was not present and residents vowed to wait for him. Mqikela said they would stay at the police station until Mpato did something about their cries. Mqikela threatened to blockade the main road connecting towns to Hartbeesfontein if their demands were not met. He said he would make sure there was no schooling until they got a satisfactory response. Other cops tried to plead with the crowd to leave but they were met with insults and more chants. Mqikela later addressed the crowd. He said they would return the next day if there was no reaction by then. Cops refused to talk to Daily Sun, saying they were not in a position to comment on the matter. At the time of going to print, the provincial police had not responded to the SunTeam’s queries.
