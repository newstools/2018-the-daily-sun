A MAN locked up for digging up dead kids, mummifying them
and turning their dead bodies into dolls may soon be released. According to news.com.au, Anatoly Moskvin (52) was a well-known
academic living with his parents in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia’s fifth largest
city. In 2011, his parents’ belief that their son was a clean
living genius was shattered when he was arrested for digging up 26 bodies of
children who died between the ages of three and 15. He then personally mummified them, which involves taking
out all the internal organs, draining any body fluids, and then pumping in
chemicals that stop the body from rotting. He then pushed music boxes inside their rib cages before
dressing them up in clothes and putting make up on their faces. He also celebrated each one’s birthday. He had been doing this for nine years by the time he was
bust. Anatoly’s mum Elvira, then 76, told cops after he was
arrested: “We saw these dolls but we did not suspect there were dead bodies
inside. “We thought it was his hobby to make such big dolls and
did not see anything wrong with it.” Anatoly, who has been locked up in a psychiatric hospital
for years, told the parents of the dead kids in court: “You abandoned your
girls, I brought them home and warmed them up.” Now some of these parents are in a state of shock as
authorities decide this week whether Anatoly should be given back his freedom. Natalia Chardymova (46) had no idea when she visited the
grave of her daughter, Olga, who was murdered aged 10, that it was empty. Speaking about Anatoly’s possible release, Natalia said: “This
creature brought fear, terror and panic into my life. “I shudder to think that he will have freedom to go where
he wants. “Neither my family nor the families of the other victims
will be able to sleep peacefully. “He needs to be kept under surveillance.”
