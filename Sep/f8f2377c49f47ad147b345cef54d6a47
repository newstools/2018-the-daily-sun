UMLAZI, south of Durban, came to a standstill yesterday morning after protesters blocked the busy Mangosuthu highway. Angry residents of ward 74 demanded houses and blocked the highway with burning tyres and rocks. Their leader Monwabisi Ngundze said residents wanted to get municipal officials’ attention. He said they had been waiting since 2013 for houses the eThekwini Municipality had promised to build. “We’ve run out of patience and need answers now,” he said. “We can’t wait anymore. Otherwise we’ll wait until Jesus comes back. “Politicians will soon ask for our votes, but we need houses before next year’s elections.” He said an official had spoken to them and promised to bring them a report within 12 hours. As a result, they had suspended the protest – for now, at least. But if the official didn’t come back to them, he said, they would block the road again today. They were apparently told in 2016 that a sub-contractor had been appointed to start building houses. But this never happened and no one had explained to them what caused the delay. Councillor Nolubabalo Mthembu sympathised with the residents. Mthembu said she, too, felt let down by municipal housing head Mondli Mthembu. Mthembu, said people had to be moved to transit camps while the houses were being built. He said he’d asked officials to find land on which to build camps.
