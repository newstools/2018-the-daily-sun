DANGER lurks at every corner of Mbulelo Nkampule’s kasi. But Mbulelo (68) and his neighbours sleep like babies, thanks to the madala’s naked statue. Mbulelo said a former employer gave him the statue 20 years ago. He named it David and took it to his house in Kraaifontein, Cape Town. “I called him David because he reminded me of the biblical character who did many good things,” said the madala. He said he placed the statue in the corner of his yard “to scare away witches”. “I sleep peacefully every night because I am protected by David.” Mbulelo said he decided to dress the lower part of David’s body because he wanted people to stop making fun of the statue. “I always felt bad when people pointed at David’s private parts, so I decided to put some clothes on him. “David chases away evil spirits. Even witches know they cannot come here.” Neighbour Nomvuzo Nqilo (37) said she felt at ease since David had moved into the kasi. “I know I am safe,” she said. “David’s presence makes us sleep peacefully because it feels like we are being guarded by a living god.” Mbulelo’s said his wish was to get white paint so he could apply a fresh coat of paint to the statue. “In the past I could afford to buy paint, but I have not been able to do so since I lost my job. “I would be very happy if I got my hands on a bucket of paint so I can make David shine bright.”
