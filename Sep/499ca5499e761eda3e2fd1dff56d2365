LAWRENCE Shongoane (48) is alive and kicking. But, according to him, his supervisor insists he is dead and doesn’t want to see him. He used to work for a security company as a guard. In January last year, a strange insect, which he could not describe, stung him on his left eye. The eye swelled and Lawrence started feeling dizzy. He went to see a doctor and was admitted to hospital in Brits, North West. He said he phoned his boss to inform him. His condition got worse and one eye became infected, and he experienced short-term memory loss. He spent months in ICU. He said when he recovered, he phoned his supervisor, who allegedly told him that it couldn’t be him as he was dead. Lawrence said he asked his supervisor to look at his medical report, but the supervisor refused, saying he couldn’t talk to a ghost. “I have now found out that immediately after talking to my boss, the company submitted letters and documents to the Department of Labour saying I had not reported for work since December 2016,” he said. Lawrence said he approached the labour department and was advised to lay a complaint of fraud. When contacted, the security company based in Rustenburg asked to have the questions on a Daily Sun letterhead. At the time of going to print, the company had not responded.
