GOOGLE, Linda Mahle Management and King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality held a digital skills training programme at Mthatha Town Hall on Monday. More than 1 000 women from 36 wards took part in the programme, which gave people the opportunity to learn digital marketing and website creation. Mayor Dumani Zozo told those who attended that technology gave women the power to change lives. “The growth and development of any country depends on women,” he said. “The municipality is committed to growing the community’s economy, improving women’s lives and helping them feed their families.” Zozo said the programme would make a difference to the lives of young rural women. “This municipality is surrounded by rural areas and underprivileged families who don’t have computers and internet access. “We want to equip young people with information so they can put these skills to good use.” Linda Mahle Management CEO Zine Nkukwana said: “Google is aware that Africa has a large economy but hasn’t taken advantage of the internet revolution. “This programme helped a lot of women and opened doors for them to market their businesses. We want to give skills to young people and women at large so they can use the internet to their advantage.” Sesethu Mgedu, one of the young women who attended the programme, said what she learnt would benefit her business. “I’m happy I took part in a programme that taught me such a lot,” she said. “Now that I know how to market my business online, I will be able to make orders without having to go to the suppliers.”
