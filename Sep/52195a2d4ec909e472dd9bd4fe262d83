CRIME statistics presented by the police on Tuesday showed that the Western Cape is the country’s murder capital. And the province’s health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said her department is at the receiving end. “All these murders warrant post mortems at mortuaries by provincial health. All survivors and perpetrators land up in our hospitals, mostly categorised as red patients, or priority one,” she said. Mbombo met the Muslim Judicial Council last October after they raised concerns about the delayed release of bodies awaiting autopsies in provincial mortuaries. Back then, Forensic Pathology Services had a backlog of 176 bodies awaiting post mortems. Mbombo said people complain about waiting times at health facilities but don’t know their officials work on crime related matters. “I have to appoint more forensic officers, assistants and specialists at mortuaries to collect evidence at crime scenes, in addition to more nurses and doctors. “Health absorbs all social ills,” she said. The latest statistics show the country’s murder rate increased by 6,9% in the past year, with 1 320 more people murdered than the previous year. Police commissioner General Kehla Sitole announced a shortfall of 62 000 police members. Organisations in the province are concerned about the increase in the murder rate. Social Justice Coalition members have been pressing for equal distribution of cops. Secretary general Mandisa Dyantyi said the statistics reflected the unequal allocation of cop resources, pointing out discrimination against poor black and coloured people. “If you look at Nyanga, 306 people died in the past year but if you look at the statistics, Claremont has more police resources.”
