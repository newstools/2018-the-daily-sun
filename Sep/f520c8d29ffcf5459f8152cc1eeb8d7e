RESIDENTS of Mandlalathi in Umkomaas, KZN South Coast, have vowed to get rid of livestock thieves. They bust three men on Wednesday who were transporting goats in a Toyota Tazz and bakkie. The men were cornered near the Umkomaas River. One was caught and the rest fled on foot. Headman Mzikayifani Gumede said residents set up a roadblock after they heard suspicious cars had been spotted. He said residents pulled the cars off the road and moered the men, but two escaped. “We stopped the cars and found goats in the Tazz and bakkie,” said Gumede. “Residents released the goats and caught the driver of the bakkie. “We called the cops and he was arrested. We’ve started a campaign to get rid of stock thieves. “Our campaign is gaining momentum and other villagers are joining us.” Ward 2 councillor Zakhele Hlongwa said residents had asked him to help them bust the thieves. He said three goats were identified by the owners. “The suspect led police to the bushes. Seventeen more goats were found,” he said. “Residents had been complaining to me that they were losing their livestock.” Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the suspect was charged with stock theft. She said they were due to appear in the Vulamehlo Magistrates Court today. Gwala said Dududu cops and the Kokstad stock theft unit were searching for the suspects who were on the run.
