Gatvol residents picketed outside the gate of the municipality demanding to be given jobs on Friday. Business had to shut down in Malamulele after newly established Malamulele Residents Association supported by local residents marched to the Colins Chabane Municipality in Limpopo demanding to see the mayor. The community accuses the Municipality of corruption after recent appointments of senior officials in the Municipality were filled with "ANC comrades". Speaking to Daily sun John Mthombeni said the community is gatval after the ANC region in Vhembe instructed the mayor through a WhatsApp messageÂ  to appoint their ANC comrades. Mthombeni said the community of Malamulele will fight tooth and nail against this corruption. Collins Chabane Mayor Joyce Bola denied the allegations that she was intructed via WhatsApp to appoint ANC comrades. All business, including foreign-owned shops remained closed.
