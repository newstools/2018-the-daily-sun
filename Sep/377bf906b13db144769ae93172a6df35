FORMER Ukhozi FM DJ and station manager Bhodloza Nzimande, said he never thought a boy from rural Richmond would be honoured with a doctorate. Nzimande was speaking after being awarded an honorary doctorate of philosophy in visual and performing arts at the Durban University of Technology on Friday. He was recognised for promoting maskandi music while with Ukhozi FM. He said he was excited and never dreamed that one day be would called a doctor. “I sincerely thank the university, especially the Faculty of Arts, for this award. “No one would have thought that one day an ordinary fellow from Richmond would earn a doctorate,” said Nzimande. “This award has opened my mind to new possibilities and opportunities. It has also strengthened my courage to do more.” The man whose real name is Welcome Nzimande was born in Phatheni Village outside Richmond, in the KZN Midlands. He joined the station in 1978 as a newsreader, translator and producer. After showing an interest in maskandi, his bosses gave him a chance to do a maskandi show. He became the station manager in 1997 before taking early retirement in 2010. Nzimande dedicated his award to current Ukhozi FM DJs and management, as well as his late colleagues. Johnny Clegg was honoured in absentia.
