A FONG kong cop is trying to trick unemployed people with promises of jobs. The suspect, who calls himself Warrant Officer Moloi, is apparently operating in Bohlokong, Bethlehem and surrounding areas Police spokesman Captain Zweli Mohobeleli told Daily Sun: “Residents of Bohlokong and nearby areas should be aware of a man calling himself Warrant Officer Moloi. “It’s been reported that the suspect has been targeting job seekers, calling and promising work with the police for a certain cost. “So far, we haven’t had complainants who have lost money. We advertise posts online, in newspapers and on radio and won’t send a member to the community. Anyone who meets the ‘cop’ promising a job should contact the nearest police station immediately.”
