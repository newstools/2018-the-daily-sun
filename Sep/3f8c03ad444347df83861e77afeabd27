WE DON’T want our son to thwasa! These angry parents want their 16-year-old son back home after he was allegedly kidnapped by a sangoma in Soshanguve, north of Tshwane. Johannes Vilankulu (48) of Stinkwater in Hammanskraal told Daily Sun that his son disappeared on Tuesday. Johannes left for Mpumalanga that day to go and look for a job. He said he got a call the next day to say his son had gone to thwasa. “The news of my son’s disappearance hurt me so much.” Johannes said in 2015, the sangoma took another one of his sons to thwasa without their permission. “This is disrespectful. How can he target my children? Who told him that I want sangomas in my family?” asked Johannes. He said the sangoma who kidnapped his son would pay a heavy price. He said he believed the sangoma was trying to steal his ancestors’ spirit. The leader of Tshwane Ratshwana Dingaka Lebaporofeta Association, sangoma Fanyana Hlongwane (54), condemned the incident. “This is kidnapping. There was no agreement between the family and the sangoma. “Such actions make us look bad,” he said. Fanyana said some sangomas were after money. Police spokesman Constable Herman Moremi said the family should approach the station commander if they had difficulty opening a case.
