 KwaZulu-Natal police are investigating a case of murder after an Inkatha Freedom Party member was gunned down between Estcourt and Colenso on Saturday evening. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Zakhele Joseph Mazibuko and another man were ambushed by an unknown car. Mazibuko, who is also the Publicity Secretary of the IFP in the UThukela District, was shot dead. Mbele said the second man was unharmed. According to the party, the 44-year-old was killed shortly after a district meeting. "Whilst we wish not to speculate on the nature of the reasons of this tragedy... it is of serious and grave concern that the killing of politicians has become a permanent feature of the political landscape of KwaZulu-Natal." Hlengwa said Mazibuko was a committed and dedicated leader of the IFP, who served the community with integrity. "The IFP and the community of UThukela have been robbed by agents of darkness and enemies of peace of a hard-working servant of the people. We are indeed poorer because of this untimely loss."
