DJ  Happy Gal has ventured into acting. The Durban house and kwaito DJ, whose real name is Happiness Ndlovu, is doing too well in front of the camera. She is part of the cast of the local movie Uncovered, set to hit cinemas early next year. The music spinner, who hails from Empangeni in KZN, told SunBuzz she never imagined she’d one day grace movie screens. “I grew up always wanting to do something challenging. This is the reason I became a DJ. “Working in this male-dominated industry is a big challenge. “I had to work harder and do more to prove my worth. I fulfilled that dream and I’m now living it,” she said. DJ Happy Gal said acting is a different ball game. “Acting is just amazing. I never imagined I would become an actress one day. “It’s a new challenge. I grabbed the opportunity with both hands.” She said she was inspired by amazing and dedicated young women who do great things. “I’m a member of Imbumba Yembokodo. It’s a group of young women who strive to change the lives of other people. “The group consists of hard workers who give their all. “The group inspired me a lot and I realise now that I’m a villager who can take on the world head on. “Who knows, maybe one day I will become a renowned playwright and movie director. “This movie indicates that there are many great things that will come my way,” she said. She thanked director Zuko Nodada for giving her a chance. The movie features Dumisani Mbebe, Thenjiwe Moseley, Sthandiwe Kgoroge and Sorisha Naidoo.
