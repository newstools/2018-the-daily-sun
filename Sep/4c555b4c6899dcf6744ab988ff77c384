THE Masilelas are terrified their attackers might come back to finish them off. Their house was petrol bombed last Sunday and they have to start from scratch. Everything was destroyed in the fire. Speaking to Daily Sun, Sophy Masilela said her mother and her grandkids nearly died when their house was set alight by unknown men. “We’re still in shock after this incident, and we’re worried how we’ll pick up the pieces and move on with our lives,” said Sophy. “My mother is still in hospital and my niece is in ICU. Those attackers nearly killed everyone.” She said gogo Martha (67) and her grandkids were sleeping when they heard a window breaking and something being thrown into the house, causing a fire. “It was in the wee hours of that Sunday when I received a call alerting us that my family was in danger. “If it wasn’t for the tenant who woke up after suspecting something was wrong, all my family would be dead.” Sophy said the tenant rescued the gogo and kids. “They were all taken to hospital. My 11-year-old niece is still in ICU. She inhaled smoke and sustained severe burn wounds,” she said. Another family member, Isaiah Mashegwane, said it was clear the attackers wanted to kill everyone. He said the tenant feared for his life and had moved out. His family now lived in fear of being attacked. “We’ll wait to hear from the police for any progress in their investigation,” he said. Constable Thapelo Ntuli confirmed that a case of arson was opened. He said no one had been arrested yet.
