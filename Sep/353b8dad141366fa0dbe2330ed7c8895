Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga called for a convention with the police, School Governing Bodies and the social development department to tackle difficulties in schools. Speaking in Tshwane yesterday, Motshekga said the education sector had been affected by a number of tragedies and unfortunate incidents. She sent her condolences to the family of Gadimang Mokolobate, who was stabbed by a pupil in North West on Thursday. “It’s extremely heartbreaking to lose a young teacher who had so much potential. He started teaching at the school in April.” She said she was also shocked to learn of the death of two young children suspected of having died from food poisoning. She also reflected on the tragic deaths of six pupils in a horrific accident in Mpumalanga and a pupil who drowned in KZN. Motshekga said there were incidents of pupils found with drugs and explicit videos. In some high schools, objects such as scissors, which were used in science laboratories, were used as weapons. “We appeal to parents to be more involved in their children’s lives and to speak to them about social ills and dangers.” Motshekga also urged parents to be more vigilant as child abductions were on the rise. She said matric exams began on 15 October. “We expect 787 281 pupils to sit for the exams at 8 000 exam centres.” The department’s director general Mathanzima Mweli said Swahili had been approved in the curriculum.
