ALL the community of Bethanie outside Brits, North West, want is development. Residents have accused Glencore’s Rhovan mine of failing to live up to its promisess. They took to the streets yesterday and blocked two main entry points into the kasi and burnt tyres and trees. One of the blocked areas was the entry to the mine. They said there was no water in the area, despite promises made by the mine. Schools didn’t have toilets, another broken promise. Resident Kgotso Lebako said: “This mine hasn’t contributed to community development in the whole time it has been here. “They promised to build toilets in schools as part of their short-term planning, but that hasn’t materialised. “This mine hasn’t let us in on its plan. We’ve tried to sit down with management. “Each time there are meetings, they say they will act but don’t. The only thing this mine did was build a clinic.” Police intervened and the groups were dispersed. Colonel Adele Myburgh said no arrests were made. Phones rang unanswered at Glencore mine when Daily Sun tried to get comment.
