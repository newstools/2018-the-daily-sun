NELSON Nelson Mandela Bay residents have been praying for rain after the region was declared a drought disaster area. But when the rain finally came, it meant chaos for residents along roads in the city and in Wells Estate. Daily Sun spoke to resident Nomfundiso Ngcongosane (33) as she was sweeping away water that had flooded her new RDP house. She said she found her house flooded when she got up on Sunday night to get an extra blanket. “When I got out of bed, I saw all my belongings floating in water.” She blamed the municipality for failing to address the lack of stormwater drains in their kasi. “We’ve been asking the municipality to install stormwater drains since 2015, as our houses are in a low-lying area. “If we had the drains, our problems would be solved but nothing has been done. “Without them, we will always be flooded whenever it rains. “I’ve been trying desperately to get the water out of my house without luck as the rain continues to pour down. “The water has already damaged my kitchen, sofas and wardrobe. I don’t know where I will get money from to buy new furniture. “What’s worse is our municipality doesn’t seem to assist people living in RDPs by providing relief. “Every time we are flooded here, they don’t come and assess our situation,” Nomfundiso said. A spokesman from the municipality asked Daily Sun to give him time to ask for an update about the stormwater drains in Wells Estate. He had not come back to us at the time of going to print.
