Sho Madjozi has been given the opportunity to perform at the Global Citizen event this week in New York City. Madjozi will be the only African act on the line-up and will be performing alongside Cardi B, Janet Jackson and The Weekend. Naturally, she agreed and took on this once in a lifetime opportunity. Unfortunately, this means that she will have to miss some of her scheduled performances here at home including Home Coming Africa due to take place in Tshwane this weekend. “It is a huge opportunity. I am mind-blown. To the organizers of Home Coming Africa, you know how much I would’ve loved to be there. Thank you so much for supporting me, for understanding, for allowing me to go out there and chase my dreams” she said. Sho Madjozi will be replaced by Black Motion at Home Coming Africa. My people! I have BIG NEWS ?????? Shout out @black_motion for covering for me at #HomeComingAfrica have fun you guys ???????? A post shared by  Maya (@shomadjozi) on Sep 25, 2018 at 10:10am PDT
