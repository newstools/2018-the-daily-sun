TSHWANE mayor Solly Msimanga yesterday avoided the vote of no confidence against him. Msimanga remained mayor after council speaker Katlego Mathebe ruled that the EFF’s motion would not be debated. This came after DA councillors said there was no written motivation to consider the motion urgent The ANC walked out of the council meeting when its motion of no confidence didn’t take place, because the member who tabled it wasn’t present. Mathebe said the meeting was postponed but the ANC’s motion would remain on the agenda. The event disappointed protesters, who were singing outside in anticipation of the mayor’s removal. ANC members, some of who had spent the night at a vigil in Burgers Park, sat down when they heard what had happened. The coffins some members had been carrying throughout the day soon disappeared. Sangomas who had been dancing outside in their traditional outfits also left. The SunTeam had earlier spoken to the sangomas to try and find out if they could predict what the outcome of the meeting would be, but they danced without saying a word. Although he survived yesterday, it seems Msimanga’s troubles are far from over. The EFF’s Benjamin Disoloane said the party would be taking the matter to court. Mayoral spokesman Samkelo Mgobozi said the will of the people had been done. He said: “The mayor remains unshaken in the face of motions of no confidence. The ANC is attempting to overthrow the city’s government, only to re-establish their networks of patronage and corruption.”
