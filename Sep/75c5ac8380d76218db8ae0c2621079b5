DO YOU wish there was some way all the terrible potholes and other road issues would get fixed? The city of Joburg has an idea to improve the conditions of its roads. The city unveiled a new asphalt plant that will produce road materials needed to fix and maintain roads to a safe standard. Nonhlanhla Makhuba, member of the mayor’s council for transport, with Goodwill Mbatha, the acting managing director of Joburg Road Agency visited the site of an upgraded 1965 factory in Ophirton, Booysens. The old, abandoned factory had been stripped down and rehabilitated for its new use. Nonhlanhla said: “Most of our roads have gone far past their intended shelf life.” “The new budget of R1,2 billion allocated to JRA should change that. “R250 million of the budget is set aside specifically for road rehabilitation and reconstruction. Another R181 million has been set aside for bridge rehabilitation.” R226 million has been set aside to upgrade storm water drains. At least R8,1 billion is to be spent on fixing and replacing gravel roads. She said that they are pleased as the road upgrades will bring much-needed change to the communities they serve. The upgraded plant now produces 200 tons of liquid asphalt mix an hour – more than a 100% increase in output. The plant can also produce cold and warm mixes of asphalt. It will increase the ability of the JRA maintenance teams to respond quicker to tar service defects.
