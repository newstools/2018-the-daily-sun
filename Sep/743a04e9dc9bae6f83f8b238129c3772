TODAY is a big day for Nedbank’s Team Ke Yona players! The 16 players who played against Free State Stars in the Ke Yona Challenge will today be drafted into the 16 Absa Premiership teams for a one-month trial period, during which they will hope to secure professional contracts. The responsibility of “sorting” the players fell to football fans who could vote on the matter until Sunday at midnight. Team Ke Yona’s star midfielder Lunathi Mdatyulwa, who raised his hand in the Ke Yona Challenge against Nedbank Cup reigning champions Stars, says he is ready to join any team, as his mission is to get a PSL contract. The 21-year-old attracted much attention with his vision on the ball and defence-splitting passes. He also scored the consolation goal for his side on the day in their 2-1 loss to Stars. Said Mdatyulwa: “When the results are announced I will be ready to showcase my talent in any team in the PSL. “It is an opportunity that comes only once so I won’t be picky, saying I want to join this team or that team. “The only thing I must do is to avail myself and do the best wherever I go.” The player from Hout Bay has played with Ajax Cape Town, Mamelodi Sundowns and Cape Town City’s development academies. He believes this time he will make the opportunity count. “I’ve been with a few PSL clubs’ development academies but it happened when I was still young. I have learned from that. Ke Yona gave us an opportunity and I’m hoping that I can reap the benefits of this one-month trial. “I will get a club and I’ll make it,” vowed Mdatyulwa, who says he looks up to Kaizer Chiefs midfield maestro Siphelele Ntshangase in the PSL.
