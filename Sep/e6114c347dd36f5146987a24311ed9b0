A man was admitted to hospital with a sex toy stuck inside
himself, and doctors couldnâ€™t remove it at first. The 31-year-old man was admitted to the ASST Great Metropolitan
Hospital in Niguarda. The man reportedly attempted to remove the sex toy for
over 24 hours before, going to seek help at the hospital. According to the Mirror, he told doctors he was suffering
from mild abdominal pain, but had no other serious symptoms. His x-ray revealed a "long and large-sized" foreign
object in his stomach. The doctors tried to remove the object, but were unable to
remove it, due to its "smoothness and size". Confused, doctors were forced to get creative and invent a
new method of removal. They threaded a piece of wire through a tube to create a trap. This was inserted into the man's body, with the wire end
wrapping around the sex toy and being tightened until the item was able to be
pulled out.
