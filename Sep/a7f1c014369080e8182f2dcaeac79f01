Newly crowned US Open champion Naomi Osaka admitted that if she was in the crowd, she'd have been pulling for Serena Williams too during the women's singles final. Osaka became the first Japanese to win a Grand Slam singles title on Saturday as her idol Williams angrily imploded, calling the chair umpire in the US Open final "a thief". Osaka, 20, triumphed 6-2, 6-4 in the match marred by Williams's second set outburst, the American enraged by umpire Carlos Ramos's warning for receiving coaching from her box. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
