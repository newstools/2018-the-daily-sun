A 32-year-old man has been arrested by the HAWKS for
allegedly promising jobs for money. The Hawks Serious Corruption Investigation unit arrested him
in Tzaneen. Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said it is
alleged that the suspect who was employed by the Letaba Farm Estate just
outside Tzaneen, asked for R700 from each victim to secure employment at the
Farm Estate. Maluleke said following that the victims reportedly went to
the manager to enquire about their employment status as promised. To their
disappointment, they found out that they were not even on the list of new
recruits. The matter was then reported to the Hawks who tracked down the
suspect and was arrested. He is expected to appear at the Ritavi Magistrateâ€™s Court.
