EFF Councillor Maggie Mhlanga was warned about people who wanted to do her harm but she did not take the threats seriously. But on Tuesday night, her house came under attack and her Ford Ranger bakkie was burned to ashes. Maggie said the incident occurred a day after she addressed the community of Motolo Village, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, about the burning of shacks in the area. Maggie, who is a councillor in Nkangala Municipality, said she believed the attack was politically motivated. She told Daily Sun she was out on a neighbourhood watch patrol with community members when she got a call to say her house was on fire. “I often get threats from members of other political parties. I ignored those threats but they have become a reality,” she said. “We conducted a patrol to find those who have been burning shacks in the area. After receiving the call, we rushed to my house to find residents extinguishing the flames. “After this incident, I don’t know what will happen. Maybe these people want to kill me.” She said she used her bakkie to transport the sick to hospital and there were important documents in her garage, which had burned to ash. “Some people don’t like my popularity with the community, so they decided to act in an evil way. This is not going to bring me down and I will continue serving the community,” she said. Maggie said the incident caused her mum to suffer a heart attack and she had to be admitted to hospital. Police Captain Nonhlanhla Kgosana said a case of malicious damage to property was opened but no arrests had been made. Anyone with information should contact Captain Koos Mtsweni on 082 497 4217.
