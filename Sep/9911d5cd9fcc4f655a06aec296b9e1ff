STAFF and pupils at a primary and high school in Nomzamo, near Strand have been without water for the past two months. Nomzamo High School has been forced to reduce school hours because taps often run dry after 10am until the next day. “We have one teacher who had to sit at home because she got an infection from using dirty toilets,” said principal Chris Mgubanto. “We have matric pupils who are camping at the school preparing for their exams. How do I keep them here when there’s no water?” Nombutho Gobha is a cook at the school. “We have to wake up early in the morning to fetch water in a tank before we can prepare food for the pupils.” Jessica Shelver, a spokesman for Western Cape Education Department, said they were not made aware of the problem until Daily Sun enquired. “Our officials immediately contacted the principal. We will assist the schools with the provision of temporary chemical toilets and also donate bottled water.” Jean-Marie de Waal, a spokeswoman for City of Cape Town water and energy services, said: “The city is aware of the situation. “It entails the repair of a pipeline to fix the situation. But the city requires support from the community to resolve the matter.”
