FORMER two-time International Boxing Federation (IBF) lightweight world champion Mzonke “The Rose of Khayelitsha” Fana is sharing his skills to help shape the prowess of aspiring fighters in his community. The budding trainer hung up his gloves last year after spending 23 years in the ring, competing at the highest level in the sport. This year the 44-year-old retired boxer got his trainer’s licence with Boxing South Africa to pass on his experience to those in the Western Cape hoping to follow in his footsteps. The diminutive Fana says for now he is working with professionals only, because he does not have his own gymnasium. He believes sharing his knowledge with youngsters will help them grow and improve their talent on a tactical level. “Growth means continuous development. Sharing my experiences and knowledge with them will give their talent more exposure,” said Fana. According to the trainer boxing has been at a standstill in the Western Cape in recent years and that had an impact on the number of champions that were produced. The province has only four champions – IBF intercontinental bantamweight Mvuvukile “Old Bones” Magwaca, World Boxing Federation (WBF) All Africa light heavyweight Nicholas Radley, African Boxing Union lightweight Lunga Stimela and WBF African lightweight David Rajuili. “Tournaments in recent years had not made much of an impact on the development of the sport in the province,” he said. “We do everything in our ability to contribute to the development but getting funding for a tournament is the challenge,” added Fana. The trainer is currently working with Rajuili ahead of his forthcoming contest. Rajuili is scheduled to put his crown on the line against Tanzania’s Jonas Segu. Fana has also worked with the Cape Town-based Zimbabwean Nkululeko Venganayi ahead of his last three contests, with the fighter winning two.
