THE Ndlovu family is still struggling to come to terms with the death of their 17-year-old daughter. Mpilo Nkosi (17) from Barberton, Mpumalanga was raped and killed on 31 August. Mpilo’s mum Carter Maphosa (33) said Mpilo came back home from school and visited friends as she usually did. That was the last time they saw her. “We started searching for her and residents helped us, but with no success,” she said. Carter said she couldn’t go to the police station on Monday to report her daughter missing. “I wasn’t feeling well so I couldn’t go to the cop shop.” She said on Wednesday she heard some residents had found the body of a young girl. She heard the girl was wearing a school uniform. “I remember Mpilo left home in her jeans but I called my brother to go and check if it wasn’t her,” she said. Carter told Daily Sun she didn’t believe it when her brother confirmed the sad news. “My daughter was raped and strangled. “Her body was already decomposing,” she said. “I want to see the people who killed my child rot in jail. Her death left us in pain.” Mpilo’s gogo Fikile Ndlovu (55) thanked the police for acting fast to arrest the suspects. “We were worried that the people who killed Mpilo might not be arrested,” she said. Mpumalanga police spokesman Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said three men were bust and the case against one provisionally withdrawn pending investigation. “Two suspects aged 20 and 24 will appear in the Barberton Magistrates Court on Monday.”
