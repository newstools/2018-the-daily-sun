POLITICAL parties are busy canvassing and mobilising support before the 2019 national election. DA leader Mmusi Maimane is moving from province to province announcing premier candidates for his party. On Saturday, he was at Masodi Village in Mokopane, Limpopo to announce the party’s premier candidate for the 2019 general election. DA’s Limpopo leader Jacques Smalle was chosen as the candidate for premier of the province. He has been the provincial leader since 2012. Maimane said they were confident the best candidates had been selected and that they would work hard to deliver the DA’s message of building one South Africa for all. “Our people are not just unemployed but unemployable. About 37,4% of Limpopo people have given up searching for jobs. These people need real change, and Smalle is ready to bring that change. Change that will create work, cut corruption, fight crime, speed up service delivery and ultimately better the lives of all. “Smalle will make it his priority to support emerging businesses and equip small, medium and micro-sized enterprises owners with the relevant business knowledge and skills to grow and create more opportunities. I am confident he will help us win Limpopo from the ANC,” said Maimane. Smalle told a crowd of more than 200 DA supporters that he accepted the nomination. “Our people have been divided by hate and discrimination. People are struggling to put food on their tables because they are not being put first. “We are tired of empty promises and not receiving basic services. All these will change under our government and we will not lie to our people. I am filled with hope for a better future for Limpopo,” he said.
