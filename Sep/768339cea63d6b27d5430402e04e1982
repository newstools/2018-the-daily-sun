According to KCCI News, Caleb Hammond's original wish was for race stickers for his coffin but instead, a Ferrari dealership in Florida gave him the chance to experience a $3-million race car. A dying wish come true It was a day to remember for Caleb as he sat passenger in a Ferrari 488 Challenge race car driven by Jody Coenen where the car reached a speed of 325km/h. The driver also performed a few donuts much to the boy's delight.  Time reports that young Hammond enjoyed himself as it was his dream to drive a race car someday.
