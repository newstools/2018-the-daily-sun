RESIDENTS of Sherwood in Durban said their hopes of having decent homes were raised when eThekwini Municipality gave them house numbers. But after waiting for close to a year, they are starting to lose hope. The residents told Daily Sun they left Mayville in 2012 to build shacks in Sherwood. They left Mayville because it was overcrowded. Resident and ward committee member Gloria Etris (49) said when they first got to the area the municipality destroyed their shacks but they refused to leave. “They came here in January and gave us numbers. “They promised we would receive RDPs in Cornubia but we are still living in shacks.” Another resident, Sandile Mkhize (45), said their councillor didn’t bother to visit them and was never in his office when they went to ask about the houses they were promised. “We don’t know if we will move,” he said. Sandile said life was hard because they had no water or electricity. “There are not that many of us in this squatter camp but still, the municipality is failing us. “Oddly enough, they don’t forget to campaign during election season, but they disappear when it’s time to fulfil their promises.” The SunTeam sent an enquiry to the municipality on Friday. Follow-up calls were made to municipal spokesman Mandla Nsele, but he didn’t answer his cellphone. Another request was sent on Monday but there was still no response. Several phone calls were made yesterday to Nsele and other officers in the municipality’s communications unit, but their phones rang unanswered.
