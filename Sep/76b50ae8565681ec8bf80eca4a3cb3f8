THIS gogo won’t let old age keep her down! Elizabeth Sebogodi (66) from Orlando West, Soweto, is a midfielder for Pimville Stars Football Club. She used to go to the clinic every month before she started playing soccer. “The last time I went to the clinic, I was told to come back after three months,” said gogo Elizabeth. She started playing and training with Pimville Stars earlier this year after watching a soccer game played by gogos. “I just fell in love with the game and decided to join the club,” she said. “Today, instead of taking a taxi from Orlando to Pimville for training, I walk. Many people, young and old, get sick because of stress and a lack of exercise. “I feel rejuvenated. I can run non-stop for more than an hour. It might sound difficult, but once you start it becomes very easy,” she said. The gogo told Daily Sun that exercising doesn’t only keep her fit and healthy but makes her feel good about herself. “Exercising doesn’t have to be strenuous to be effective. A 20-minute workout every day can reduce the risk of getting many diseases,” she said. The grandmother of five is also a member of the New Apostle Church. She listens to jazz and her favourite musician is Louis Armstrong. “My favourite soccer club is Kaizer Chiefs,” said the gogo. “I’ve been a fan since the early 1970s when it was formed.” She said her favourite player of all time is Doctor Khumalo.
