REFRIECA Chiloane is ambitious and driven. The 25-year-old from Mpumalanga is a rookie entertainment presenter at Bushbuckridge community radio. Refrieca told SunBuzz: “I landed the job early this year. The station gave me this opportunity because they saw the hunger, talent and the drive I have for radio.” She said she will work hard to make a name for herself. “I love radio. It is fun and expressive. I want to see myself as a presenter at one of the national radio stations,” she said. “I’m planning to study broadcasting next year and make sure I learn almost everything about radio.” Refrieca added that she gets inspiration from Metro FM’s DJ Fresh. “He is so cool and humble. People respect him and his work. I want to be a female version of him.” Refrieca, who is also a professional dancer, is no stranger to the entertainment industry, having co-hosted SABC1’s Fan Base. “I was introduced to the industry as a dancer. My experience inspired me to grow my passion for radio.” Refrieca describes herself as a lover of the arts. “I’m planning to open a dance school for rural kids. It’s difficult for them to show their talent because they don’t have a platform to do so. “I want to give them a chance,” she said.
