THE Shembe Church in KZN can’t believe that the municipality had the cheek to tear down their temple. eThekwini Municipality’s land invasion unit demolished the church’s temple at Thornwood outside Pinetown, KZN on Friday. Leader of the temple, Preacher David Dlamini, said they were confused by what the municipality did as they had asked permission to built the structure from ward councillor Reggie Cloete. The Shembe church conducts their services outside, but the temple was built for services when it rained. Dlamini said they were shocked that the unit had attacked God’s temple. He said when church members called him, he rushed to the temple and found the unit busy smashing down the temple. “They said it was a land invasion and they were sent to demolish the structure.” “They are heartless and devilish. This was a direct attack on God.” Yesterday, the SunTeam found Dlamini and church members circling the area with white stones. Church member Buyani Khawula (50) said they will take up the matter with mayor Zandile Gumede. Khawula said they never expected this, especially as government leaders came to church leader Mduduzi Shembe for blessings. Cloete said it was true that church leaders asked him for permission to build a structure, but they said they would just build a shelter, not a proper house. Inkosi Mduduzi Shembe’s spokesman Thokozani Mncwabe expressed shock, but said church leaders would go to municipalities around the country and ask for title deeds to their temples.
