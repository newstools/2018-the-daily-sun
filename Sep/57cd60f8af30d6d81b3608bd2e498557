FREEMAN Mjoli said when his wife Nomsa died at 48 in March, it was because of a broken heart. The 51-year-old from Orange Farm extension 2, Joburg, told Daily Sun all their dreams were shattered last year when they fell victim to a scam that robbed them of their retirement money. Freeman said they decided to buy their own home and found an estate agent named Felicia Chabangu online. “At first, she was very kind and took us to look at three houses and we liked one in Braamfischerville. It cost R200 000 but we told her we could only afford R170 000,” he said. Freeman said Felicia took them to her house in Protea Glen. “We trusted her as she had showed us where she lived. She agreed to sell the house to us for R170 000 and the following day, we transferred the money into her account,” he said. Freeman said Felicia kept postponing the day they could move in. When they eventually went to her house, they found she had disappeared. He said when he went to the house in Braamfischerville, he found another man moving in. “He said he had been sold the house for R175 000. He also ended up not moving in,” said Freeman. Around this time, Nomsaa became sick and she ended up dying in March. Freeman said he believed she blamed herself for finding the estate agent. Protea Glen police spokesman Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng told Daily Sun cops were looking for 33-year-old Felicia in connection with two cases of fraud. “She was arrested last year. She appeared in the Protea Magistrates Court and was released on bail but she never returned to court,” he said.
