MINISTER Angie Motshekga said communities must work with the department of education to address the level of violence in schools. She was speaking during the Matric Second Chance roadshow at Govan Mbeki Multi-purpose Centre in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. Motshekga condemned all forms of violence in schools. Anathi Baku (20), a grade 11 pupil at Nathaniel Pamla High School in Peddie, was allegedly killed by a 16-year-old pupil while trying to intervene in a fight between two pupils who were fighting over a missing cellphone on Thursday. Osborn Senior Secondary School principal in KwaBhaca, Mount Frere recently suffered a gash on his forehead after being attacked by a pupil. “The problems we face in our schools are drug abuse and violence,” said the minister. “These problems require the community to hold hands, support the pupils and change the way we run society.” Eastern Cape police spokesman Captain Khaya Tonjeni told Daily Sun: “A 16-year-old pupil is expected to appear in court after being arrested. “He has been charged with murder. Baku was stabbed with a sharp object.”
