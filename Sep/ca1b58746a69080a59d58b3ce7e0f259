TWO people who planned the murder of a police official have been sentenced to life in prison. Theresa Mabaso (35) and Wiseman Ngomane (28) were sentenced by the circuit of the North Gauteng High Court sitting in Barberton, Mpumalanga, on Wednesday. Earlier this year, Mabaso and Ngomane were found guilty by the same court of killing 37-year-old Constable Sifiso Mabuza at Langeloop, near Tonga, in March 2013. The court heard how Mabaso hired three hitmen, including Ngomane, to kill Mabuza. This came after Mabuza, who worked for Crime Intelligence in Komatipoort, exposed her for dealing in dagga and she was arrested. She hired the hitmen and paid a deposit of R10 000 after agreeing to pay them a total of R46 000 for the job. The three went to the victim’s house and killed him after a scuffle. One of the suspects pleaded guilty in 2016 and was sentenced to 20 years for murder and 18 for housebreaking. Another died before his case was finalised. Throughout the trial, both Mabaso and Ngomane told the court they were innocent. However, they were proved guilty by the state, leading to their life sentences. On top of being sentenced to life imprisonment, Ngomane received a nine-year sentence for housebreaking with intent to commit murder and possession of a firearm and ammunition without a licence. Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma welcomed the sentences, saying the pair deserved to go to jail for life for planning the murder of a police officer. “We welcome the sentencing as it sends a clear message to criminals that anyone who kills a police officer has declared war on the whole country.”
