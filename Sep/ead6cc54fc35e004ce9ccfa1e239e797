EVERY weekend, they carry coffins of children killed on the streets. Every day kids are killed but the gangs’ bullets never seem to run out. Yesterday, Bontehuewel residents told Police Minister Bheki Cele they were gatvol of crime and demanded that government act – and act fast! The minister visited the area yesterday to meet leaders who organised the ShutDown protest on Tuesday. Community leader Paul Phillips said: “We’re gatvol! Young people are dying every day. Every weekend we carry white coffins to the graveyard.” Residents said they only had a satellite cop shop that closed at night and that police who had to deal with their cases were in Bishop Lavis. Cele said: “I agree with you when you say you don’t feel safe here. You can’t always be number one in terms of the murder capital (Nyanga). “We have to work together and dethrone it.” Residents asked Cele to investigate who the gun-runners were because gangsters kept shooting and their bullets never ran out. Former Seskhona leader Loyiso Nkohla asked him to form an inter-ministerial task team. He accused local government of failing to properly equip the neighbourhood watch teams in poor areas. Henrietta Abrahams, one of the ShutDown protestors who was arrested on Tuesday, said: “We want an interministerial imbizo at the end of October. “If you’re not going to do anything, we’re going to the streets again!” Cele promised to take up the matter with deputy president David Mabuza and ministers who should be part of the committee. “I’ll come back here next week with the national police commissioner and try to broaden the committee. We’ll discuss matters and prepare the nature of the imbizo.”
