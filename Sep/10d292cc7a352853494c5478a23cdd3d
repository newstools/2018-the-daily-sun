The Freedom Front Plus
is planning on taking MEC of Education Panyaza Lesufi to court. But Lesufi said that
he is not intimidated! The FF+ submitted a
formal complainy in which Lesufi is accused of contravening Section 29 272
times when he called for Afrikaans-speaking schools in Gauteng to switch to
English as a medium of instruction. According to the
affidavit, Lesufi has been accused of violating Section 29 of the Constitution. The section states
that everyone has the right to receive education  in the official languages or languages of
their choice. The affidavit, signed
by FF+ MP Adriaan Van Staden, accuses Lesufi of a hostile attitude towards
Afrikaans. “Since 2014, the
Honourable Lesufi’s actions and his public campaign against Afrikaans, labeling
it the so-called Apartheid language and the language of the oppressor, serve as
proof that the MEC is in contempt of Seciton 29 of the Constitution and is,
thus, violating Seciton 135 of the Constitution,” the affidavit reads. But Lesufi has hit
back. “I am honestly not
intimidated by those who think a non-racial education system is a breach of the
constitution,” he said. “Non-racialism is the
future, and I am ready to face those frivolous and time-wasting charges.”
