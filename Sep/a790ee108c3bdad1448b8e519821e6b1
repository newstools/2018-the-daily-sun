THIRTEEN people appeared in the Mbizana Magistrates Court yesterday on charges of murder following the death of an interim chief at Dindini Village in Mbizana. Chief Thulani Mjanyelwa (57) was allegedly stabbed with a sharp object and set alight near his home last month. The community of Dindini marched to the court pleading for the release of David Sogoni (55), Dumisa Phephu (70), Zandise Xabadiya (32), Notemba Cele (48), Mzolosi Mbulawa (73), Amos Msinga Gongotha (57), Nothemba Msinga (40), Mzimasi Nqukwe (19), Mthokozisi Deyi (38), Nonkathazo Deyi (47), Nomonde Phephu (69), Ntombifikile Hlabe (45) and Jabulile Mjanyelwa (38). Luxolo Tyali of the NPA said the accused were in court for a formal bail application. “The state is opposing bail. The case could not be heard because there was no magistrate available. The bail application is set for Monday,” said Tyali. Mjanyelwa will be laid to rest at Dindini Village on Saturday.
