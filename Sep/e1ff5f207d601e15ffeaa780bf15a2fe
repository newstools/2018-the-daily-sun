IT wasn’t just any gogo . . . it was well-known artist, Dr Esther Mahlangu (82) herself, who presented classes on her Ndebele paintings. Sitting on the floor at the National School of the Arts in Braamfontein, Joburg yesterday, surrounded by about 20 pupils, she worked with only a white piece of cardboard, different coloured paints and a feather brush. “I trust you will all do a greater job than me because you are more educated than I am,” said Mahlangu, watching the pupils to make sure they were paying attention. She then demonstrated how to make the Ndebele paintings. As part of Heritage Month, Mahlangu has designed special packaging for Albany Bakeries and Tastic rice. Mahlangu said she was happy about the partnership and that the final design looked beautiful. She said the art of traditional paintings is part of our culture. “I encourage the generation of today to love their culture and teach future generations,” she said. “Find your passion and once you achieve it, hold on tight to your success.” She said the younger generation should stop travelling at night to drink alcohol. “Alcohol is dangerous and a killer.” Tsebo Mokwena (17) and Ntsaho Nhuna (17), both in grade 11, said they were honoured to be taught by Mahlangu herself. Ntsaho said: “At the beginning it appeared to be a very difficult challenge but it was a fun new experience that felt close to home.”
