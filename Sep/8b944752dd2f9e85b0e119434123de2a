MULTI award-winning artist Zahara has embarked on a motivational tour. She and her team are visiting schools almost every week, where they give pupils motivational talks and entertain them. Zahara, whose real name is Bulelwa Mkutukana, told Daily Sun she was doing this out of love. “We go to different schools to motivate the kids. No one is paying or sponsoring us. It’s just love,” she said. She said all she wanted was for the children of today to be better people. Zahara said she was lucky to have made it in music. “I went back to the village some years back and saw some of the people I used to go to school with. Their lives are a mess. “They’re involved in bad things and I feel had someone motivated them, things would have been different.” She said she was prepared to give motivational talks for the rest of her life. “I want to teach pupils to respect school uniform. They should respect teachers and education. Everything starts there.” Co-founder of the Sbusiso Leope Education Foundation, Themba Thebe, said through these motivational tours they hoped to create future leaders. “We teach them respect, good behaviour and the importance of educat on,” he said.
