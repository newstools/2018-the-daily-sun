SELLO Thabethe was a peace-loving man who used to break up fights whenever he could. However, his kind heart ended up costing him his life at a tavern on Saturday. The 36-year-old from Wattville, Ekurhuleni tried to separate two men as they were fighting. One one of them allegedly pulled out a knife and stabbed Sello in the neck. He was rushed to hospital but later died. Angry residents went on the hunt for the killer but he managed to flee the scene. He was later caught in KZN after cops were tipped off about his whereabouts. Sello’s grieving mum Deborah said she would never forgive the murderer as he had taken away her jewel. “Sello was a very responsible person who was loved by everyone,” she said. “I just hope the law takes its course and the person responsible rots in jail.” Sello’s gogo Rebecca Motubatse said she was tormented by strange dreams full of blood for three days before Sello was killed. “I even consulted a sangoma but we couldn’t see who the target was.” Police spokesman Captain Pheelo Mothapo said a murder case was opened for investigation. The suspect appeared in court and will make a second appearance soon.
