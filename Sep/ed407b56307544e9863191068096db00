ONE of Mthatha’s oldest schools is so overcrowded that in some classes, up to five pupils are crammed around a single desk. The ceilings of some of the classrooms at Attwell Madala High School are crumbling while the walls of the school’s prefab classrooms have huge holes in them. The toilets at the school are in such a poor condition that more than 1 000 pupils are forced to relieve themselves in an open field. When the SunTeam recently visited the school, the classrooms had more than 80 pupils squashed in together. SGB chairman Ndoyisile Fudumele said no maintenance had been done at the school since it was built in the 1970s. “Even the prefab classrooms provided by the education department are now crumbling. “Our children’s safety as well as that of the teachers is at risk,” he said. Ndoyisile said at one point, parents and teachers had to chase away thugs who were selling dagga muffins to pupils in broad daylight. He said in 2016, education department officials informed them that R81 million had been made available for a proper school to be built but nothing ever happened. Learner Representative Council president Loyiso Sikhotha said: “People just walk through our classrooms on the way to town because there is no yard. We can’t have evening classes because there are no lights and it’s unsafe.” Eastern Cape Education department spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said the school was on a list of schools to be rebuilt. “We have appointed a service provider but we have a crisis as the number of schools hit by disaster has spiked and we had to redirect some funding. “We will have to stop building until the schools hit by disasters are fixed,” said Mtima.
