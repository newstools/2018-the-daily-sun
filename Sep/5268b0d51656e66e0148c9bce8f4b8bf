SECURITY guards at Wiggins High School in Mayville, Durban said they feared being attacked by land invaders. This comes after the school was vandalised and petrol bombed on Thursday by a group of people who demanded to build shacks on the school premises. One of the guards told Daily Sun that the group of more than 50 people stormed the school in the early hours of the morning and threatened to kill them if they refused to open the gates. He said the group threw a petrol bomb into a teacher’s office and smashed windows in some classrooms. The group apparently told them they would come back and burn down the school if they continued to stop them from building their shacks on the premises. He said they called cops and informed the principal after the group left. “We fear for our lives. These people are armed. They vowed to come back soon,” said the guard. SGB secretary David Mdletshe said they asked the police to patrol the school premises. KZN Education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said the department would meet school management and local leaders to try to resolve the matter. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said cases of malicious damage to property and public violence were opened at Cato Manor Police Station but no arrests have been made.
