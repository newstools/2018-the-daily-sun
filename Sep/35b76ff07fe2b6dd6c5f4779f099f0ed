MARGARET Dlamini wants cops to act fast to arrest the man she believes killed her daughter. The 62-year-old mum from Inanda, eThekwini told Daily Sun her daughter Gugu (30) was found lying dead in a pool of blood in her rented room on Sunday. She said she was convinced the woman’s boyfriend had slit her throat. Margaret said knowing that the man who killed her daughter wasn’t jailed made her blood boil. “I want cops to arrest him.” Margaret said her daughter told her the man often beat her. “Even on Saturday, Gugu told me he wanted to kill her. She said he got angry over small things and acted like an animal. I told her to come home.” However, Gugu told her she wanted to stay in her room. “On Sunday morning, the boyfriend came to my house looking for Gugu. I told him she wasn’t there. He left but a few minutes later, a resident came to tell me Gugu had been found dead. I rushed to her room as it’s not far from my house.” Margaret said the boyfriend was already there when she arrived. “I told him I knew he had killed her and he just ran out,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the Inanda police were investigating a case of murder. “The suspect is known and police are searching for him.”
