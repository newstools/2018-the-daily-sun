OLGAR is terrified of her dead mum, who will not let her sleep. Her mother, Florence Chisakarire, who died in 2016 at the age of 70, wants her daughter Olgar Chisakarire (33) of Ramogodi in GaRankuwa, Tshwane and other family members to go and collect the money she is owed by a Zimbabwean politician. Florence used to sell duvets from her home in GaRankuwa. In 2014 the gogo from Zimbabwe took care of Tinashe Jonas, his wife and child because they had no place to stay. Olgar told Daily Sun the gogo sold Tinashe a duvet for R1 000, but he paid her only R400. “Tinashe ran away at night without paying his debt or even saying goodbye,” claimed Olgar. “Since January my mother has been coming to me in a dream demanding her money.” Olgar said the only thing that would calm her mum’s spirit would be for Tinashe to pay up. Olgar’s husband, Macleans Shumba (36) said they called Tinashe and he promised to pay at the end of last month. But now he is ignoring all their SMSes and calls. Daily Sun contacted Tinashe, who said that he bought the duvet on credit but settled the balance after two weeks. “They think I have money lying around to give to anyone with silly claims because I appear on TV. This happened four years ago. Why bother me now?”
