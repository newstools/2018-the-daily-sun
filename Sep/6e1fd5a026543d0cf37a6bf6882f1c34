“WE ARE all products of African medicine.” These were the words of North West Traditional Affairs MEC Ontlametse Motshware. She was speaking to traditional healers at Ipelegeng in Schweizer-Reneke, North West on Friday. The aim of the meeting was to celebrate African Traditional Medicine Day. Motshware said the country had about 200 000 traditional healers. “According to the World Health Organisation, up to 80% of people in Mzansi rely on traditional medicine for primary healthcare.” The MEC said as the country was celebrating Heritage Month, she was proud to support the Dingaka Association, which promotes traditional medicine. “As government, we must work in partnership with other departments such as health and forestry in sharing ideas on achieving a healthier community,” she said. Kgosi Mosimaneotsile Lekoko was at the event. He said: “Western medicine comes from indigenous plants, so it’s important for Western and traditional doctors to work together.” Gobusamang Mere, chairman of Dingaka, urged traditional healers to support each other and share knowledge on how to use herbs.
