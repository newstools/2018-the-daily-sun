A RESIDENT of Bhongolethu in KwaZidenge claims Home Affairs is destroying her future. Siphokazi Dyosi (28) said she applied for an ID in 2010 but was still waiting to receive it. “It’s been eight years but I still I don’t have an ID. I went to Home Affairs on a number of occasions but was given a temporary ID. “Officials said I share a name, surname and date of birth with a stranger.  My child doesn’t have a birth certificate. I can’t apply for a grant or go to school.” She said an official had told her it would take a long time to resolve her case. Home Affairs district operations manager Ngenisile Stuurman said: “I wasn’t aware.  Who was assisting her in her kasi? “We work closely with community leaders  Where was she when our trucks drove around KwaZidenge?”
