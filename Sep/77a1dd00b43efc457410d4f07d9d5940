Gqom Queen Babes Wodumo, real name Bongekile Simelane is slowly but surely making a name for herself internationally. One of the 24 year-old’s international moves this year was getting on Black Panther: The Album with a song titled Redemption. She seems to have grown quite the appetite for international audiences and has worked with some internationally acclaimed artists in order to appeal to them. Her latest single is even titled Orkant and features famous American DJ Diplo, who is a fan of Babes’ music. The Angisona hitmaker took to social media to announce the release of the song on Tuesday. “This is the day that the lord has made and we will rejoice and be glad in it,” Babes captioned a snippet of the song, “Orkant single is out, thank you Diplo for making this work much love and respect.” Diplo, whose real name is Thomas Pentz Jr, called Babes a “Giant Talent” on social media. “Huge tune! Giant Talent Babes.. Represent South Africa,” he tweeted.
