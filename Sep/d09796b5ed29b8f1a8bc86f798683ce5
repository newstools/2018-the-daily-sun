THE changes to Mzansi’s visa regulations have the potential to boost the economy through tourism and make business travel easier. Announcing the changes in Tshwane yesterday, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba said these would contribute to the stimulus and recovery plan President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Friday. Gigaba said the reforms would include amendments to regulations applying to foreign minors travelling to South Africa, visa waivers and relaxation of visa requirements for certain countries. “We’re simplifying the rules on travelling minors who are foreign to minimise disruption to legitimate travellers without compromising the safety of minors and the rights of parents.” Gigaba said the simplification of visa requirements to countries such as China and India would make provision for taking biometrics on arrival in Mzansi. He said this would allow visa applications via courier and issuing five year multiple entry visas. “This should be in place in October. “Easing movement will help to attract a larger numbers of tourists, business people and families.” He said e-visas would improve the process of issuing visas to tourists and business people visiting the country.
