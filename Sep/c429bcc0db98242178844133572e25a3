SHOCKED Mafoko family members told community members they do not know what happened on the night that seven family members burned to death. Nine-month-old Sanga Mafoko; Koketso Mafoko (2); Mopopo Mafoko (3); Manga Mafoko (5); Boikanyo Mafoko (19); Lebogang Magoko (21); and their mum, Boitumelo Mafoko (48), died when their shack in Senthumule in Koster, North West caught fire while they were sleeping at about 1am on Saturday morning. The region has no electricity or running water. Two boys, aged seven and 10, were not sleeping at home when the tragedy occurred. Speaking at the memorial service, family representative Martha Dinake said the family was still in shock. Although they had no idea what might have caused the fire, they suspected it may have started when a candle fell over during the night, setting the shack on fire. Manager in the office of the mayor at Kgetlengrivier Municipality, Onkokame Moremi, said plans to help the family were successful and the inter-governmental relations department managed to get coffins, groceries, cows, a tent and burial services provided. The funeral of the family members will take place at 7am tomorrow at the Extension 4 sports ground.
