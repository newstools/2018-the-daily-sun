Orlando Pirates midfielder Xola Mlambo has been named as the club's Player of the Month for August, as voted by supporters. Mlambo narrowly beat Vincent Pule to the award after a month which saw him feature in all six of the Buccaneers' matches.The other finalists for the award were Happy Jele, Ben Motshwari, Justin Shonga, Siyabonga Mpontshane and Augustine Mulenga."It's a great honour to be nominated for such an award, especially in a time where we haven't been doing as well as we had planned for as a team," Mlambo told the official Orlando Pirates website."When we get onto the field, we aren't thinking of awards, but rather to help the team win games so to be here right now is a pleasant surprise."Pirates has picked up just seven points from their opening five Premiership fixtures, also crashing out of the MTN8 quarter-finals to SuperSport United, but Mlambo is hoping that the international break can help them regain their momentum."We are working hard as a team and always want to do well for each other and the supporters. We finished the season strong last year and we need to build on that," he said."We have an international break now where we can focus fully on preparing and look forward to getting back into the swing of things when we resume the league."
