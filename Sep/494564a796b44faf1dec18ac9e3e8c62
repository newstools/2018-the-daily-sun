MAMELODI SUNDOWNS are undergoing a worrying goal drought, having gone four games without scoring. Their last goal was on 11 August when they defeated Golden Arrows 2-0. Today, things will have to change drastically for Pitso Mosimane’s lads when they meet Cape Town City in the second leg of their MTN8 semifinal at the Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville at 3pm. They have to score today, otherwise they will be knocked out of the tournament. They are trailing 1-0 from the first leg after defender Tyrique Fillies swept home the only goal in Cape Town last Saturday. The Brazilians’ goal drought saw them knocked out in the Caf Champions’ League Group stages on Tuesday when they were held to a 0-0 stalemate by Guinea side Horoya AC. Mind you, Sundowns have not won the MTN8 tournament in a decade and now aim at this trophy as consolation. And the pressure is on Downs attackers Themba Zwane, Gaston Sirino, Jeremy Brockie, Lebogang Maboe and Sibusiso Vilakazi to get goals on the day. Maboe was recently snapped from Maritzburg United and has settled well at the Brazilians. Sundowns goalkeeper Denis Onyango has stressed the importance of them scoring a goal in today’s match. “At the moment, we’re looking for goals as we need to score and not concede,” said Onyango. “If they can score one, it’ll be harder for us. I think we also need to help our strikers from the back by providing more balls. It’s a team effort, not only about strikers. “There’s no crisis. Maybe, clubs are defending more, but we need to find a solution. All we want is to go through it no matter what.” Onyango admits they had a disappointing week, they have put all behind going to today’s game. Onyango said: “This is the one cup we haven’t won. After we were knocked out of the Champions League we’re focused as we’ve been in this situation before after losing the MTN8 final to Wits and Champions League.”
