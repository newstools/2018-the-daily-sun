RAGING fires are becoming a big headache in the Vhembe district of Limpopo. A few weeks ago, the luxurious Joe Matsila guesthouse outside Vuwani was burnt to the ground. Soon afterwards, the house belonging to well-known reggae artist and Muvhango actor Jackie Nethomboni was also gutted by a raging fire. More devastating fires were recently reported in the district. On Monday, an unexplained fire gutted seven thatched rondavels at Kalahari Inn in Sibasa. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. The fire was allegedly spotted on the roof of one of the rondavels at about 1pm on Sunday. A witness said: “The fire spread to other buildings and the firefighters were helpless as they ran out of water. We are worried that if this matter is not treated as an emergency, many people are going to lose their properties.” Construction water trucks were sourced to help the firefighters with water, who fought the fire until late in the evening. Vhembe municipal spokesman Matodzi Ralushai said they have bought two more fire trucks to boost the existing fleet. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the fire. “We are investigating but so far we don’t suspect any foul play,” he said.
