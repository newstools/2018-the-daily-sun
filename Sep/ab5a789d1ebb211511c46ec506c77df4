Former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala made his European debut this past weekend. The 33 year-old came off the bench to a rousing reception as his side Buyuksehir Belediye Erzurumspor went down 1-0 to Emmanuel Adebayor’s Istanbul Basaksehir in the Turkish Super Lig.  Shabba will be hoping to change his new side’s fortunes soon as they currently languish at the bottom of the log. After getting a taste of European football, the former Bafana Bafana midfielder will now be crossing fingers for his first start when his side take on 11th placed Sivaspor in the next round of fixtures. Tshabalala is fan favourite in Turkey after arriving from Kaizer Chiefs where he spent 11 years and played 372 times for the Glamour Boys finding the back of the net 58 times. Meanwhile, there were mixed results for a number of other South Africans plying their trade in Europe. Bonagni Zungu was stretchered off on the hour mark as his side, Amiens SC, played out to a 0-0 stalemate with Saint Etienne. It is still unclear whether the Zungu’s knock will keep him out of Bafana Bafana’s Afcon qualifier against Libya on Saturday 8 September at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. Percy Tau and Thulani Serero on the other hand, played the full 90 minutes for their respective outfits Royal Union Saint-Gelloise and Vitesse, who both slumped to defeats.
