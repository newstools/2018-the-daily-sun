shack dwellers have threatened chaos if they are not told why they were evicted. The owners of 19 shacks in Zinniaville, near Rustenburg in North West, were evicted on Wednesday morning, allegedly by the Rustenburg Municipality. The traumatised residents said they were woken up by people who said they were there to remove them. Their settlement is behind the Zinniaville Shopping Complex and they have been living there for three years. Community leader Tsietsi Mohulatsi said men in blue overalls said they were from the municipality and had a court order. “Residents were given no notice that they would be evicted. Where will they go at such short notice? They didn’t say if they had a safe place to house them temporarily.” EFF Councillor Jane Mpolokeng said the municipality has failed its people. “They were supposed to bring proof of owning the land or provide alternative accommodation for the people, as stated by the courts. Where are they supposed to go?” Municipal spokesman Andrew Seome said he wasn’t aware of the eviction.
