THERE’S something special about Nedbank Ke Yona Team captains. Since the inception of the Ke Yona Talent Search in 2013, all the players who had been tasked with leading their team on match day, received contracts with Absa Premiership clubs. And the same thing is expected with this year’s skipper Nkanyiso Nene, who will captain the Ke Yona team when they face Nedbank Cup reigning champions Free State Stars at Makhulong Stadium, in Tembisa today (3pm). This is the sixth edition of the Ke Yona team campaign. Since the inception of this initiative, coaches Shakes Mashaba and Khabo Zondo have unearthed exceptional talent that went all the way from dusty streets to play in the top league. The competition even produced an Olympian in Aubrey Modiba. In the first edition of the Ke Yona Team Search in 2013, coaches handed Collen “Baggio” Mashawa the armband. His impressive performance could have won him a contract with PSL clubs, but age was no longer on his side, as he was in his 30s. But he was roped in to be a member of the technical team the following year and now he’s one of the Ke Yona Team Search coaches. In the following years, Sydney Masana (2014), Ian Chikohwa (2015), Bongane Mbuli (2016) and Kamogelo Mogotlane (2017), were all signed by Premier Soccer League (PSL) clubs. And this year’s captain, Nene, has also vowed to do a similar thing and add cherry on top by winning the game for the first time. “Stars are a big team, but we’re not going there for autographs. We’re going to Makhulong to put up a fight and ensure we emerge victorious at the end of the match,” said the soft-spoken lanky defender. “Knowing that all the past leaders did well and got contracts with PSL clubs put us under a bit of pressure. But the first job that needs to be done is to make history by winning the match. We owe it to Nedbank.” In the past five years, the Ke Yona Team have lost all their matches, scoring only one goal, which they scored last year against SuperSport United.
