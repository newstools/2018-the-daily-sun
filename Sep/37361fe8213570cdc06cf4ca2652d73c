FOR three years, gogo Nomusa Zulu and her family have had to live with kak running through their yard. The family of five from Thuba-lethu in Melmoth, KZN, told Daily Sun a sewerage drain in their yard, close to the kitchen, was constantly overflowing, causing kak and foul-smelling water to flow through the yard. The family said keeping the windows closed no longer helped and the smell had become part of their daily lives. House owner Nomusa (62) told Daily Sun the kak had caused sickness in the family. She said when it first started she informed the King Cetshwa-yo District Municipality, but they did not help her. “They told me to inform my councillor, but this is not something that should be sorted out by the councillor. They should come here and fix this,” she said. She said the workers at the office refused to help and turned her situation into a joke instead. “I then decided to clean it up myself. My son and I dug a channel to let the kak and dirty water flow in another direction and not all over my yard,” she said. She had been forced to send her grandchildren to live with their mother, because they kept on getting sick. “I believe the smell and kak in our yard caused that,” she said. She said she did not know what to do any more. “I hope the municipality will finally listen to my plea and resolve this matter. I use disinfectant but it does not help.” The district municipality’s spokesman, Rekha Naidoo, said he would investigate the matter.
