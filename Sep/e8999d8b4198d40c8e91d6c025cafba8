WHEN rubbish remains uncollected, it makes the area look untidy and scares customers away from local businesses. Thabiso Mkhize sells amagwinya, polony, cheese, fried chips and Russians from a small shop in Mayville, Durban. Thabiso (22) said rubbish on the road next to his business hadn’t been collected for three weeks now. And this was affecting business. “During lunchtime, many people buy from me but have been staying away for the past three weeks,” said Thabiso. Some of them have said they won’t gamble with their health. “This is worrying because, after I failed to save money to go to varsity, I opened this business just to make ends meet. “If the rubbish stands in my way of getting a few hundred rands, it will have a negative impact on my family.” Thabiso said that they didn’t know why the rubbish hadn’t been collected by the municipality. A customer (32), who made a U-turn without buying anything at Thabiso’s shop, said: “I like his amagwinya. I always buy here during lunch. “It’s closer to my work. But when I see so much dirt and flies I can’t risk my health.” Daily Sun tried unsuccessfully to get hold of municipal spokesman Mandla Nsele via email.
