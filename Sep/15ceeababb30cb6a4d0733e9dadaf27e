HE would contact people online who had expressed their
desire to kill themselves, telling them he’d help them die. When they came to his flat, he strangled them with rope and
then chopped up their bodies, keeping some of the body parts in cooler boxes. Takahiro Shiraishi (27) from Zama, near Tokyo in Japan
allegedly managed to do this to nine people between August and October last
year before he was bust by cops. According to The Sun, Shiraishi had built up a small
following with two Twitter accounts. One was called "I want to die"
and the other "A professional at hanging". He described himself as being desperate and seeking
company, as well as being skilled in helping people commit suicide. The police had been searching for a missing Tokyo woman,
who turned out to be one of his victims. Eight of the nine were women, all of whom had been sexually
assaulted, said cops. They were all between the ages of 15 and 26. Shiraishi told investigators that he committed the
murders to steal his victims money because he “wanted to lead an easy life,” according
to Japan Times. In one case, he scored ¥360 000 (about R48 800) from a
victim. On Monday, Shiraishi was confirmed to be sane enough to
be charged with the nine people’s death and stand trial.
