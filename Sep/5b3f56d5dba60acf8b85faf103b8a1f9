Mzansi star athlete and gold medalist Caster Semenya
stars in a new Nike advertising campaign. The advert starts by showing Semenya running on the
tracks and as usual going faster than other participants. It then plays her life backwards to the time she took her
first step as a baby. The message in the Ad seems to be addressing all her haters. In the Ad Semenya can be heard saying: “Would it be easier
for you if I wasn’t so fast? “Will it be simpler if I stopped winning? Would you be
more comfortable if I was less proud? “Would you prefer I hadn’t worked so hard or just didn’t run
or stopped at my first steps? “That’s too bad because I was born to do this.” The advert ends with the message: When you are born to do
it, just do it.
