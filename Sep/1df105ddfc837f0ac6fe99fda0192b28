TODAY, Drink Beer Day, you can feel proud every time you raise your glass. There are thousands of varieties of ale, beer, lager and pilsner made in hundreds of countries worldwide every day since the ancient Egyptians first started brewing. Ancient papyrus scrolls which record the beer brewing process are dated to around 5 000 BC. These first beers were made with dates, pomegranates and indigenous herbs so they were likely quite harsh on the throat by our standards. Drink Beer Day encourages drinkers to try brewed liquor other than their favourite lagers. To celebrate, gather some of your friends, buy a few sample packs of local craft beers and taste test whatâ€™s available.
