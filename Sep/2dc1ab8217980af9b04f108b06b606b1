STUDENTS from Capricorn FET College in Limpopo have shut down four campuses to raise awareness about unpaid allowances. They claimed they had not received allowances since 2016, and threatened to shut down all campuses until their grievance was addressed. They also threatened to write to the public protector. On Thursday they marched to the college’s central office in Polokwane in search of answers from CEO Lekau Mamabolo. Student leader Pastor Machaba said they would not return to class until they received their allowances. “We are tired of management’s lies and broken promises. The National Student Financial Aid Scheme paid the money into the college’s account in February, but management is adopting delay tactics,” he said. Machaba claimed some students were being charged for accommodation even though they were not living in campus hostels. Mamabolo said: “We are still experiencing challenges related to the allocation of funds, especially at the Seshego campus. We are working on the matter and plan to make sure every qualifying student is paid accordingly. Those who have experienced funding errors must raise their problems by engaging with our admin offices.”
