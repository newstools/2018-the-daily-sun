RESIDENTS of Dukathole extension 8 in Germiston, Ekurhuleni, yesterday started rebuilding their shacks, which were destroyed in a fire on Monday. The blaze destroyed 24 shacks. The residents are pleading for help, but they have decided to take matters into their own hands. Sandile Buthelezi said he rebuilt his shack because government was taking too long to help. “They promised to bring zozos on Tuesday, but we still don’t have them,” said Sandile (28). Joyce Tshabalala (54) said: “I’ve been waiting for a zozo since Monday. She said she didn’t have money to rebuild the shack. “I stay with my five kids. A zozo won’t accommodate all of us. “I’m thankful to my neighbours, who’ve offered us shelter.” Ward councillor Oupa Tshabalala said he provided affected residents necessary supplies such as food parcels and blankets while organising shelter for them. “We told the residents that government will help them,” he said. “The service providers are already in the area. “They’re just waiting for the materials to start building. “In the meantime, we helped clear the debris.” Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng was also in the area to help.
