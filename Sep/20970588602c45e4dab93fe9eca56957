The man accused in the triple murders of a Phoenix mother and her two daughters has "fainted" while in the holding cells of the Verulam Family Court on Tuesday. A court official who had been to the holding cells came into the court and asked community members who packed the public gallery for the accused family's contact details. She said they wanted to find out from the family if the accused had a medical condition as he had fainted. "The ambulance has arrived and he is currently in a drip for 30 minutes," said the official. Jane Govender, 44, and her daughter Rackelle, 16, were found dead by Govender's husband on Friday morning. The body of their older daughter, 22, was later found in a cupboard. The 45-year-old man, who is known to the family, was traced and arrested on Friday night, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said. Family members sobbed uncontrollably in Phoenix on Friday as the bodies of the mother and two daughters were removed from their home in Tashmeer Mansions. Their home was surrounded by hundreds including neighbours, bystanders and family members as police forensic teams and investigators combed the crime scene. "This is not something that you expect to happen here. I cannot believe this took place right under our noses," a resident said at the time.
