WHEN Edwin Rashilo’s marks started dropping, his teacher Samuel Mamogo grew concerned. When he asked Edwin what the problem was, the grade 9 pupil from Ngwatoanape Secondary School in Mohlotsi outside Groblersdal said he was stressed because he and his brother Sylvester didn’t have birth certificates. “I went to Groblersdal Home Affairs to seek help for them, and we were referred to Matlala Hospital, where they were born,” said Samuel. “The social worker compiled a report for us to present at court.” Eveline Matlala, the boys’ aunt, said the family had been struggling to locate their mum Julia Mokoma. She said Julia, who’s originally from Lesotho, left the boys after their father was buried in 2014. “The children are being taken care of, but they are struggling to apply for identity documents without their mother. “We tried to get help for them, but we were unsuccessful,” said Eveline. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the father’s relatives could help the brothers with the late registration of birth process. He said: “It should be noted that the process is stringent to ensure that only those who qualify for South African citizenship are entered onthe national population register. “The applicants should provide the department with the necessary documents as required by the office where they apply.”
