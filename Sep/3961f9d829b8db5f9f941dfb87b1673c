A MOTHER wants a principal who allegedly dished out hot klaps to her son to pay for his action. She said her child’s ear was injured after the klaps and he is on medication. The mum (37), from Phoenix in Durban, claimed her son was klapped and punched by a principal from Phoenix High School on Friday. She claimed her son (17), a grade 10 pupil at Phoenix Technical Secondary School, was on his way to school and was already late when he came across the principal. She claimed the principal shouted at him to get into school. “My son told him that he was a pupil of another school and not his.” She said the principal didn’t care and shouted at him. Apparently he then klapped the boy and even punched him. She said her child then went home and told her brother. “My brother took him to school and asked the principal about the incident. The principal denied it and they went to the police station to report the matter. My problem is that the principal hasn’t been arrested following the incident. “Even if he was one of his pupils, he shouldn’t have beaten him but disciplined him correctly for being late. Corporal punishment is not allowed.” The mum said she wants the department to deal with the principal. Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said they would investigate. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of assault was opened at Phoenix cop shop. “Once the investigation is complete, the docket will be sent to court for a decision.”
