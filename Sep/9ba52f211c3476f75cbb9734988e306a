THE COMPANY was established just two years ago by Jomo Khomo and his wife, Kefilwe. And just like many other start-ups, KELE Mining Solutions struggled to grow until an intervention by Anglo American’s iron ore business, Kumba Iron Ore. Since the intervention by Kumba two years ago, KELE Mining Solutions has a 3000% revenue increase a year and created over 150 jobs for local people. Khomo said the company is still hoping to grow from where it currently is. He is thankful to Kumba for their intervention. “It changed our lives and we believe we’ve changed the lives of many people here in the Northern Cape,” he said. Khomo said that their partnership with Kumba has inspired them to empower smaller businesses as well. “We give local businesses contracts and help them so they have the skills we need. We provide them with equipment and knowledge so they are able to compete.” They have also secured opportunities in Rustenburg in the platinum mining sector and are exploring opportunities in Botswana. "We are always looking at opportunities to improve safety and productivity to help South Africa’s mining industry become globally competitive." KELE Mining has also given birth to KELE Logistics, which does bulk materials transportation. “In the next four to five years we want to list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange,” said Khomo. When it comes to people, Khomo says they take a special interest in their employees and their families. “Assets you can replace, but for us the people are the business,” he said. One of the people who benefited from the creation of KELE Mining Solutions is HR Officer Jeminah Soakatsie (41). She has been with the company since March last year. “The company was very small but now it has grown. We are like a family here. I think that’s because it is owned by one of our own people I like it here and my aim is to work my way up to HR manager position," she said.
