THE gogo of a 17-year-old accused of stabbing his maths teacher to death last week said the incident has devastated her. The 78-year-old told Daily Sun the boy was good and talkative as a child. But he later became withdrawn and started locking himself in his room. She said although he wasn’t violent, the boy’s mum noticed something was wrong and offered to take him to church for prayers, which he refused. The boy allegedly stabbed a teacher at a North West high school on Thursday. The gogo said she could relate to what the victim’s family was going through as her daughter was stabbed to death by another pupil at school eight years ago. The gogo struggled to hold back her tears as she and the boy’s uncle told the SunTeam they were shocked by the incident. They said they wanted to meet the dead teacher’s family. During his first court appearance, the suspect saw the magistrate in chambers and was accompanied by a social worker. He has not been formally charged as he will be dealt with according to the law applying to minors. He will appear in court again tomorrow when a decision on formal charges will be made. The boy allegedly had a grudge against the teacher as he had apparently stopped him getting a second plate of food from the school feeding scheme. His gogo said the boy had not had anything to eat on the day of the incident.
