POLICE are urging job seekers to be on the lookout for fake ads posted in newspapers and on social media. On Friday, cops in Empangeni, north of Durban discovered scammers had been using the name of a school in Dondotha to con unsuspecting job seekers. The scammers asked their victims to deposit R2 850 into a money market account so they could secure teaching jobs at the school. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said cops were investigating a case of fraud. She said 12 people told police they were defrauded of more than R34 000. Gwala urged members of the public to verify any information the received about a prospective job. “People must not pay money for job opportunities because this is not a requirement in government departments. “If anyone else was conned, they must please come forward and submit their statement to the investigating officer. Victims can contact Empangeni station commander Brigadier Jerome Thango on 035 901 5805/6,” said Gwala. Provincial education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the department does not ask people to give them money in exchange for jobs. He said the department hadn’t advertised any vacancies at the school.
