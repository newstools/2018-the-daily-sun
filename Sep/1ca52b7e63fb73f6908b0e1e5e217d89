Owning and running a business is not easy. To help employers understand the various labour laws, the Free State department of labour hosted its annual employer campaign. It was held on Tuesday at the President Hotel in Bloemfontein. The campaign is aimed at employers in and around the province to share vital information about the services available to them. The department taught the employers about the various labour laws which govern how workers must be treated. Jimmy Mosho, chairman of the National African Federated Chamber of Commerce, said: “We face challenges because of the high rate of unemployment. “We have to work together with municipalities and the department of labour to try and create more jobs,” he said. Mosho said they had asked the department to also go to kasis to give small business people information and not hold these sessions only at hotels. “They should travel to areas where they are needed,” said Mosho. Emily Maneli, director of public employment services in the Free State, said: “We are here to interact with employers. Our section registers work seekers. “To find them employment, we need employers to work with us and register with us when they have vacancies.”
