A TEENAGER says she has fallen in love with her zombie-doll
called Kelly and plans to marry her later this year. Kelly, who was bought for Felicity Kadlec (19) when she
was 13, was found on a "creepy doll collection website", the Daily Mirror is reporting. Her face is
half rotten and covered in fake blood. But it wasn’t until she was 16 that Felicity realised
that what she felt for Kelly was something special. Now she says she has accepted that Kelly is “the one” and
is preparing for their future. "I have had boyfriends in the past, and I always
thought that I was in love with them - but they never made me feel the way I do
now. "Unfortunately a lot of people don't understand our
relationship, but I am so confident that I'm in love with Kelly that I got her
name tattooed on my arm. "I am intimate with Kelly - I caress her and feel
safe with her, and I feel a genuine connection when I'm having an intimate
moment with her," said Felicity. But not everyone is as enthusiastic about her passion for
Kelly as Felicity is. She said: "I do even receive criticism from my
friends and family - if we go out with them they won't let me bring Kelly with
me. "If we go for food she always has to stay inside the
car because people will stare at her, so we've never been able to have a date
in public. "But regardless of what other people think about our
relationship, she makes me happy and I love her so that's all that
matters."
