DIKELEDI Nyokong can make magic with her hands. The 34-year-old from Thaba Nchu, Free State, paints shoes and caps and her products are a big hit with young people ekasi. Dikeledi completed her matric at Calculus College in Bloemfontein in 2004 and went on to study a bachelor’s degree in administration at the University of the Free State. Dikeledi said she first became interested in art in grade 9 when she drew a portrait of her mum. “I couldn’t believe it. I didn’t study art at the time but last year, I went to the State Theatre in Tshwane and saw beautiful Ndebele painted takkies. “I was very interested and told myself I was going to make them at home. I started doing research on this unique style of painting and bought some takkies and fabric paint. “I started mixing colours and playing around with them. It worked and the takkies were beautiful. People love them.” Dikeledi said she also painted caps, T-shirts and women’s shoes. “I market my business on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. I am targeting both male and female. Art is like therapy for me and it keeps me busy,” she said.
