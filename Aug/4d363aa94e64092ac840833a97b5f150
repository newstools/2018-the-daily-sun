FREE State Stars coach Luc Eymael will appear before the Premier Soccer League Disciplinary Committee after failing to attend a post-match press conference. After Stars 2-1 defeat against AmaZulu at King Zwelithini Stadium on 19 August Eymael left the stadium without speaking to the press who were patiently waiting for him in the stadium boardroom. The 58-year-old flouted the NSL’s Compliance Manual which states that any ambitious Premier League coach would be forgiven for being angry and throwing tantrums, but declining to attend the mandatory post-match press conference is regarded as a very disrespectful act. As reported by SunSport last Tuesday, the PSL issued a statement confirming all the clubs, coaches and a player set to appear before the league's DC. Luc Eymael and Free State Stars: The Free State Stars coach has been charged with contravening the NSL Compliance Manual (Media Manual) after he failed to attend a post-match press conference/ mixed zone after the Absa Premiership fixture between Free State Stars FC and AmaZulu FC on 19 August 2018 in Durban. He will appear on 04 September 2018.

Eric Tinkler:The Premier Soccer League has called Mr Tinkler to appear in front of the DC for making comments that brought the League into disrepute on 24 February 2018 while he was still coaching SuperSport United FC.
