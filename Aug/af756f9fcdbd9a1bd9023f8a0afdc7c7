Rapoo Sethabela’s father went missing, but was never found. His father Solomon Sethabela (68) was last seen in 1996 in Maboloka, North West. Twenty-two years later his brother, Sergeant George Sethabela (43) also went missing in June. But George’s decomposed body was found in the veld in Danville, Pretoria West on Friday. Rapoo had previously told Daily Sun they had looked everywhere for George without any success. He said they were worried he might have been kidnapped because he left for work and never returned. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said cops were investigating the circumstances surrounding George’s death. Police confirmed the sergeant, who was stationed at Atteridgeville K9 Training Academy, was reported missing in June. “The deceased’s personal belongings were found in a bag next to his body,” said Masondo. “The motive for the killing is still unknown and no one has been arrested.” Anyone with information that could help in the investigation or arrest of the suspects is urged to report to their nearest police station or call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
