HIGHLANDS PARK coach Owen Da Gama says the players, who were rewarded with contracts when the team got automatic promotion to the Absa Premiership at the end of last season, need to step up and prove their worth. The Lions of the North didn’t make wholesale changes after winning promotion. The technical team decided to stick with most of the players who had played a big role last season. They are trying to avoid what the club experienced in the 2016/17 campaign, when they signed many Premier Soccer League rejects and ended up being relegated. But after two games in the top flight, the stage seems to be too big for some of their young players, as they started on shaky ground, getting a draw in their first two matches against Orlando Pirates and Black Leopards. In those two games, there were signs that the Lions of the North will struggle yet again in the top flight if they don’t improve quickly. In the second game against Leopards, they also had terrible moments when they were exposed in set-pieces, conceding two goals in the last three minutes of the match at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa. On Wednesday, the Lions of the North visit Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld Stadium at 7.30pm. Although they’re yet to lose, Da Gama said he was disappointed with leadership on the field from his players. He felt they could have done better in their last game against Leopards. Da Gama is aware that not all of them will be able shine, but has urged them to take responsibility. He said: “This is where you separate the men from the boys. So far, what I’m very disappointed with is leadership on the field. “We always tell the players about the critical phases of the match, but still we conceded in the dying minutes. “Defending too deep and poor leadership will cost us, but the players will improve as the season goes on.”
