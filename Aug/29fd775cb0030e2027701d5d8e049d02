THIS DAD will spend the rest of his life in prison after being found guilty of raping his daughter. The 49-year-old dad appeared in the Mhala Regional Court in Thulamahashe on Friday. The court heard the father used to rape his daughter (6) until he was bust in March last year. He was arrested after the victim told someone, who then reported the matter to the child’s aunt. He threatened to kill the mum and victim with a panga. He pleaded not guilty, saying his mother-in-law had falsely accused him of rape because he didn’t pay lobola. But the court rejected his testimony. Social worker Lethabo Dibakwane told the court the accused informed her that he was suffering from a mental illness, but no signs of being mentally ill could be found. “It shows he is a heartless father who robbed his own daughter of her dignity,” said Dibakwane. Prosecutor Kidiboni Bareng told the court it was time for cruel rapists to be removed from society. Magistrate Elmarie Theron said the accused lacked remorse and undermined his daughter’s privacy.
