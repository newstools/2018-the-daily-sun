WHAT do you need to have in a car? Spare tyres and car jacks are important but life does throw a lot more than just flat tyres. Regardless of who you are, make sure these items are in your car. Phone charger If you need to make an emergency call or navigate to safety, the last think you need is a dying battery. Buy a phone charger that plugs in the cigarette lighter and keep it in the car. Jumper cables What’s more annoying that a dead battery is not having jumper cables. Even if you are driving a brand new car make sure there are jumper cables in the boot. Medical kit You can find medical or first aid kits in outdoor adventure stores. They can’t restock an ambulance but it’s a good idea to have some plasters, bandages, gauze, antiseptic cream and some feminine hygiene products in your car. Bottled water If you get stuck somewhere without water, you’ll wish you had a bottle of water or two in the car which can be drunk or used in an overheated engine. Towels If you’re stranded or soaked in a storm, towels dry you or keep you warm.
