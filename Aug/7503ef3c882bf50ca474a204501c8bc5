A 29-year-old man was left critically injured this morning following an industrial accident at a factory in Krugersdorp. ER24 paramedics, along with another service, arrived on the scene to find a 29-year-old man trapped by his legs inside a large machine. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said that paramedics assessed the man and found that he was in a critical condition, having sustained serious injuries to both his lower legs. Rescue paramedics, along with the workers from the factory, cut the machinery apart using a plasma cutter. Once freed, paramedics treated the man and provided him with advanced life support interventions. The patient was thereafter transported him to a nearby private hospital for urgent treatment.
