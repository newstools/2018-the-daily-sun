IT probably looks like any other shack to a passerby. But once you step inside, you realise things are not always what they seem. Welcome to Thaini Masakane’s kasi spa! Thaini has beaten the odds and is setting a good example for other women to follow. The 28-year-old from Botshabelo, Free State, said she decided to open Victory Body and Nail Studio after she realised kasi residents deserved to have a beauty spa in their neighbourhood. Kasi residents used to travel long distances to get their nails and beauty treatments done, but that is now a thing of the past. The place may look like an abandoned mkhukhu from outside, but inside it’s a luxury spa that offers massages, nail enhancements and facial treatments. The pictures of her and her spa went viral, and social media users applauded her for the good work she had done. She said her inspiration came from the passion she had as a beautician. “I was exposed to many spa retreats and wellness establishments. “Working in such places inspired me to go it alone and open a business in my kasi,” she said. Thaini said business was in her blood. “I learned to stand on my own two feet when I was a 19-year-old selling Tupperware. “I didn’t let being an orphan destroy my dreams,” she said. Thaini said her dream was to see her business grow into an empire. “The response I got blew my mind. I am still in shock. “I am humbled by the positive support I got from my community as well as people from outside Free State. “I’ve been getting calls from celebrities like Blue Mbombo.”
