AN apparent suicide note written by a
twenty-eight-year-old mum is raising questions about how exactly she ended up
hanging from the fan in her room. According to Daily
Nation, neighbours of Jackline Ngugi were alerted to the fact that
something just wasn’t right when Jackline’s one-year-old baby just kept on
crying and crying. They eventually went next door to her room, only to find
the child lying helplessly alone and her mum hanging from the fan. A neighbour said it was a total shock to think this may
be a suicide as Jackline had always been “a happy lady” in the three years she’d
stayed alone at Fisheries in Mombasa, Kenya. The apparent suicide note she left behind has also raised
cops’ suspicions. The note said: “God forgive me. This was not my will
neither my wish. Fight for my blood God. Watch over my son. I have taken my
life. Mum forgive me, I did not want any of this to happen to me. Take care of
my son. God be the judge and fight for my innocent blood. If they drove me to
this be the judge.” Mombasa cop Johnstone Ipara told Daily Nation: “We are yet to establish whether she was hanged or
she killed herself. Investigation are on and we will get more information as we
continue to gather details on the incident.” The woman’s baby has been taken in by a neighbour.
