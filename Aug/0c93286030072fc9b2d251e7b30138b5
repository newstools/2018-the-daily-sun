DURING the early hours of Saturday morning, a truck tried to avoid a collision with two bakkies by veering off the N2 near Sibangweni, outside Mthatha. The truck drove through a yard and demolished Lungile Tyani’s room. Luckily for Lungile (28), he missed the whole thing as he was still out having drinks with friends. He was shocked sober when he saw his room wrecked. “All the furniture in the room as well as a friend’s computer were destroyed,” he said. According to witnesses, the accident happened at about 5am. They said the driver was heading in the direction of Mthatha. Mazwi Hewulana (27), who lives in another room nearby, was woken by a big bang and the sound of falling bricks. “I was confused. My brother told me what happened and showed me a passenger’s corpse. I started shaking from shock,” he said. Police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said: “One of the truck’s passengers died on the scene. “The driver and his assistant were injured. “Both of them were rushed to Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital. “Another passenger and the drivers of the bakkies also were taken to hospital. A case of culpable homicide is being investigated.”
