AS women’s month begins, hundreds of women across Mzansi
will be taking to the streets in support of victims of gender based violence. The Intersectional Women’s March is aiming to bring the
country’s economy to a standstill. The organisers of the march have urged men to stay away from
the march, saying the march is the abused woman’s place of refuge.
