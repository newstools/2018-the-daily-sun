Our Perfect Wedding presenter and actress, Nomsa Buthelezi has opened up about almost being raped in 2017. Nomsa told Drum magazine that the incident happened in August last year as she was leaving a party in Boksburg. The popular presenter and her friend were attacked just outside the venue by six knife-wielding men who robbed them and then tried to rape them. "It was the worst day of my life, I thought I was going to die. We were leaving and about to get into the car when these men robbed us of our belongings and tried to rape us. We kicked, screamed and fought,” she told the magazine. She went on to say that the scar in her eye that fans have seen on Lockdown is real and was inflicted during the attempted rape. Nomsa wrestled with the men, trying to fight for her life and eventually got stabbed in the eye. She was saved by the self-defense classes she had been taking for her character in The Adventures of Supermama, where she plays the lead role. "I used some of the moves we had been taught for Supermamma and some of the guys managed to run away. They told me straight that they wanted to rape me. Even today I fear driving at night, but I can’t live in fear all of my life. I was traumatized because those men could have killed me,” she told the publication. Nomsa did not open a case with the police.
