A 30-years-old
man was sentenced to two years in prison for drunk and driving. Thembani
Suprice Hlungwani was sentenced to two in jail or a fine of R24 000, by
the Lulekani Magistrate's Court. The Limpopo
MEC for Transport and Community Safety Makoma Makhurupetje said she is thrilled
with the sentence given to Hlungwane. Hlungwani was arrested
on the 08 July 2017 in a drunken driving operation by the Mopani Drunken
Driving Unit. He pleaded
guilty, after blood testvresults came back positive at 0.15mg. “We hope the
sentence will send a strong message to those who continue to ignore our warning
that Limpopo is a Zero Tolerance Zone, to those who disobey the rules of the
road.” Credit must be
given to our hardworking men and women in uniform for their continued diligence
in discharging their work without fear or favour,” Makhurupetje said. His driver’s
licence was suspended for 6 months.
