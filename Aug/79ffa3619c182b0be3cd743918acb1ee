LAST month Nolubabalo Mtwebula (20) left her house and went to church – and she was not seen again! According to her desperate mother, Elizabeth Mtwebula (50), from Hostel 1 near Bloemfontein, that was the last time she saw her daughter. In the beginning Elizabeth was not worried when Nolubabalo did not come home at her usual time after the church service. “I thought maybe she was caught up with something,” she said. As the sun was about to set, however, Elizabeth grew worried and started to search for her daughter. According to Elizabeth, although her daughter was a young adult she was mentally challenged and needed special care. As a pupil at a special needs school, however, she had learnt to be independent and knew her way home. Elizabeth went to look for her at Heidedal church, where she often went, and other places, but Nolubabalo was nowhere to be found. That was when she went to the cop shop and reported her missing. Elizabeth said the police had now been searching for her daughter for weeks, unfortunately without any trace found. Police spokesman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi confirmed that a missing persons docket was registered. Hlubi said Nolubabalo was wearing pink track pants, with a maroon jacket and blue shoes when she went missing. “Anyone with any information on Nolubabalo’s whereabouts can contact Detective Captain Tebogo Mokgobo on 082 453 0760 or 071 606 5715,” Hlubi said.
