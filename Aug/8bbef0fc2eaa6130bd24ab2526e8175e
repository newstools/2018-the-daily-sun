A PUPIL (17) is lucky to be alive after being stabbed in the chest by another kid. The incident happened at Motsheudi Secondary School in Ga-Sekgopo Village, Limpopo last Monday. The attack occurred in A classroom while the grade 9 pupils were waiting for an English lesson. The victim said the trouble started when he refused to allow the suspect to play with his word game. “He then stabbed me in the chest and fled the scene. “I was taken to the clinic and later sent to Kgapane Hospital, where I had stitches,” he said. Pupils and teachers are complaining that the incident wouldn’t have happened if the English teacher had been in the classroom. They claimed the kids haven’t had an English teacher since May this year. A pupil told Daily Sun: “We don’t know if we will pass the English exams because we haven’t been taught since May. “We urgently need an English teacher because we don’t want to fail at the end of the year.” A teacher said what was happening wasn’t fair on pupils. “It’s not good for pupils to be alone in the classroom. “Since the previous English teacher was sent to another school, why is it taking so long to find a replacement?” Sam Makondo, a spokesman for the Limpopo Education Department, said they haven’t received any report of a pupil being stabbed at the school. “We will investigate the matter. “The allegations that the pupils have not been taught for some time are serious. “Thorough investigations will be conducted and proper action will be taken,” said Makondo. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe condemned pupils who take dangerous weapons to school. “We urge parents to monitor the kids’ bags and always search them for weapons or drugs,” Ngoepe told the People’s Paper.
