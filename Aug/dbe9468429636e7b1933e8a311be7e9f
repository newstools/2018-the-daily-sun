COPS in Durban have finally arrested three suspects in connection with an incident where a concrete slab thrown from a bridge killed two kids. The kids died after a slab landed on the car they were travelling in with their parents on the N2 highway between Ballito and Tongaat in December. The children’s father was injured and had to be rushed to hospital. KZN police spokesman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the suspects, aged between 20 and 46, were bust on Tuesday night. They will appear in the Verulam Magistrates Court today to face two counts of murder and one of attempted murder. Mbele said the suspects were arrested after an extensive search by detectives. He was arrested in February after he smashed a car on the N3 in Berea, Durban. Magistrate Anand Maharaj became angry with Mthalane when he claimed he was throwing objects on people’s cars to relieve chest pains. He claimed his pain went away after damaging a vehicle. During the trial, police said the incidents cost the state more than R1 million because a team of top investigators had to be formed. During Mthalane’s trial, Colonel Langa Mhlongo said: “We were taken by surprise as it was a new crime altogether. “Our members and Metro police were sent to patrol bridges around Durban, which cost taxpayers more than R1 million.” Private security was also brought in to assist. Mhlongo said the incidents caused panic among tourists and there were fears that people would stop visiting KZN.
