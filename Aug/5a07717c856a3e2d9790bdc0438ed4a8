#FEESMUSTFALL activist Bonginkosi Khanyile said details of his meeting with Justice Minister Michael Masutha at the Union Buildings on Friday will be revealed today. “Nothing is in writing. He is a politician. They say one thing today and do another tomorrow,” he said. He has been camping outside the Union Buildings for several nights with mum Phumzile Khathini in protest for jailed fellow student activists to be pardoned. The Durban University of Technology graduate was found guilty in August on charges of public violence, failure to comply with police instruction and possession of a dangerous weapon. Khanyile, who was arrested in 2016, initially faced 13 charges but was acquitted of nine and will return to court on 16 October for sentencing. Despite his meeting with the minister, Khanyile insists his sleep-out at the Union Buildings will continue. He urged members of the public to join the protest. He said #FeesMustFall students are not criminals. “We call on young people to put pressure on government to pardon the activists. What we did was for the good of the people.”
