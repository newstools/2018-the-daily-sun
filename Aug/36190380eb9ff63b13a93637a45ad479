KEEPING girls in school has become a priority for third-year public relations students at Boston Media House in Tshwane. Their initiative, Pad A Girl, gathers sanitary towels and donated them to organisations that work with poor girls. The students donated more than 1 500 sanitary towels to the House of Labron foundation on Wednesday. They spent about five months asking for sanitary towels donations. They started the initiative to help poor girls not to miss school because of their periods. One of the students, Ntsiki Sibiya, said: “We hope the sanitary towels we gathered will help as many girls as possible and give them the dignity every girl should have when they have their periods.” The face of the initiative, Daily Sun entertainment editor Lerato Matsoso, commended the students. “The transition from girl to woman is supposed to be the greatest gift one can go through as a woman,” said Lerato. “But you suffer because you never had a thing as basic as a sanitary towel.” She urged the students to continue giving back. Dikeledi Moabelo, House of Labron foundation founder, said she was grateful. Moabelo said it was inspiring to see the young people giving back to the community.
