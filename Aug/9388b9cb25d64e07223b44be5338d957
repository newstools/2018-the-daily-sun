KZN-born actor and rapper Zuluboy has gone back to his roots. Known for pushing the limits, he has decided to move back and give back to his birthplace. He believes there’s no place like home. The Nomalanga hit maker told SunBuzz he was planning to look for gigs in KZN. “When you’re at home, you feel safe and protected,” said the entertainer, whose real name is Mxolisi Majozi. “It feels like you can conquer the world, and when you encounter challenges you have people who hold your hand and give you love. “After spending most of my time in Joburg, I thought let me go back home. “It isn’t because I ran out of luck there. I just missed spending time at home.” Multitalented Zuluboy was born in KwaMashu but later moved to Ntuzuma, north of Durban. He has starred in TV dramas such as Mshika-Shika and Gold Diggers and currently has a cameo rule on SABC1’s Uzalo. He will be one of the top artists performing at the Idili Lenduna show on Saturday at Artizen Restaurant and Lounge in KwaMashu. He said his fans can expect to dance to his old hit songs at the show. “They will enjoy Zulu Uyasabeka, Ntombenhle, Now or Never and many more. “I’m happy it will be held in KwaMashu, where most people know me personally. It’s nice to be home.” He will share the stage with fellow KZN musicians Professor, Zakwe and Okmalumkoolkat. Organiser Phumlani Mfeka said: “We’re friends and I’m glad they agreed to support me.” Get tickets for Saturday’s show for R100 general and R200 VIP
