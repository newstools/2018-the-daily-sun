THROUGH mentoring women at the She Cares Women Foundation, Khuls helps them to make it in the electrical industry. Khuls Mtsetfwa (44) from Mbombela, Mpumalanga, is a living example that women can do anything they put their minds to. She makes military vehicle electrical components. “It’s important for women to take part in electrical manufacturing,” she said. Khuls chose the field because it was dominated by men. “I always wanted to be an example and make an impact in society.” She said a woman can succeed in the industry. Khuls said during her five years as CEO of Swatek Electrical, she has trained more than 25 women. “Some work in metals, fabrication and wiring, while others are in the commercial business.” Khuls told Daily Sun military vehicle dashboards are built from scratch. She told Daily Sun that electrical components work hand in hand. “They’re the brains of the vehicle, and without them it can’t move,” she said. Khuls said there is no direct training for people who work with electrical engineering systems. “But we provide in-house training. “In future, we’ll need schools to train people in military, aviation and rail electrical engineering. “We mostly get drawings from clients and put everything together from those. “We also have clients from outside Mzansi who place orders on a regularly basis.” “Nothing is impossible for a woman, as long as she sets a clear goal that is measurable and achievable.”
