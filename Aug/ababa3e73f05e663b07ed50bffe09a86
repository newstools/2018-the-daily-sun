KLIPRIVER Taxi Association bosses in Ladysmith, KZN have accused Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda of taking sides in the taxi violence in the area. The violence between Klipriver and Sizwe taxi associations over routes has left many people dead, including commuters. Mfanafuthi Ndawo, a spokesman for Klipriver, said the violence would have ended if Kaunda had not taken sides in the dispute. He said Kaunda was also undermining the Pietermaritzburg High Court, which ruled in favour of Klipriver last year. Ndawo said the court clearly stated that the right to operate in the area legally belonged to them. “The MEC was supposed to abide by the court ruling but he decided to ignore it. “Our taxis have been parked at home since last year after the MEC suspended our operations. We don’t know why he is undermining the court ruling, so we have decided to take him back to court,” said Ndawo. He said their taxis were at risk of being repossessed by banks because of the MEC’s decision to ignore the ruling. Mluleki Mntungwa, a spokesman for KZN Transport Department, said the MEC was within his powers to suspend operations. He said if Klipriver was against this, they were free to take the MEC to court. Xolani Simelane, a spokesman for Sizwe, said he wasn’t allowed to comment about the matter.
