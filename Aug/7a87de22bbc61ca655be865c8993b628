THE ANC will only make coalitions based on principles, not for power alone. This was what ANC head of elections Fikile Mbalula said at Luthuli House in Joburg yesterday. “We are not power grabbers. We will never compromise our principles. The position of mayor is not so important to us,” said Mbalula. “We will never dictate to others about being in coalitions. “Coalitions have collapsed because they were not based on principle and the DA thought they were superior to other parties in coalitions. “We don’t want elections to come through the back door if we don’t win but we are committed to the good riddance of Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga. “Solly comes from a baas boy approach. It’s all because of white supremacy in the DA. “They are bullying everyone because they are not principled.”
