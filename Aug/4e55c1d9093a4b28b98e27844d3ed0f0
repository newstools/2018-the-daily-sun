HE stole from a local school and tried to sell the stolen goods door to door ekasi. But then he knocked on the wrong door! The teacher from Thopodi Primary School in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, immediately recognised the items, which had been stolen from the school earlier on Tuesday. She called residents and the suspect was caught and taken to the school. He confessed and took them to where he was hiding some of the items, not far away from the school. The parents found boxes containing items like headphones, toilet paper, a garden spade, a pick and carpets. The cops were called and the suspect was arrested. Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said the man was immediately taken to police cells. Parents told Daily Sun they were happy the suspect was arrested. They said they suspected he was behind a number of break-ins that in the area recently. The Gauteng Education Department said it was worried about the high number of break-ins at schools, especially during holidays. MEC Panyaza Lesufi said: “People who steal from schools are stealing kids’ education.” The department urged communities to protect their property and work with the cops to bring those behind these evil acts to book. Captain Maqabe said the man was charged with theft and had already made his first court appearance.
