WHEN nurses gave Bukeka Sikoti her stillborn baby, she suffered a stroke! And according to neighbour Nomapasile Wanga (34), the bad treatment the 18-year-old got from nurses was to blame. Nomapasile told Daily Sun she was shocked at the way nurses at Eben Donges Hospital in Worcester, Western Cape, treated the young mum when she went to deliver her baby on the ninth of this month. “The nurses beat her thighs, saying she was a drunk. The poor kid doesn’t even touch alcohol! “The nurses left her to give birth alone. When they came back, the head of the baby was out and it was dead. A scan was done earlier and it showed the baby was OK.” Bukeka’s sister Thuleka said her sister suffered the stroke after nurses gave her the dead baby to hold. After Bukeka’s traumatic experience, she was transferred to Tygerburg Hospital in Cape Town. She was discharged on Friday but she is still struggling to speak. Sandra Maritz of the health department said the baby was already dead when Bukeka arrived. She said the hospital asked Bukeka if she wanted to hold the baby as it sometimes helped with the grieving process, and had offered her counselling.
