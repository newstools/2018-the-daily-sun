APHIWE Dyantyi has refused to call his breakthrough year for the Springbok “fantastic” just yet. The explosive winger walked away with the Man of the Match award as South Africa thumped Argentina 34-21 in their opening Rugby Championship Test at Kings Park Stadium on Saturday. His performance mirrored his Bok debut against England in the June series. But the Lions star isn’t falling for the hype about him. “Let’s win against New Zealand, then we will call it a dream season,” said Dyantyi. He credited backline coach Mzwandile Stick for his improvement with off-the-ball work, as seen with his contribution against Los Pumas. The two tries he scored were particularly impressive, his unselfish offload to Makazole Mapimpi receiving widespread applaud. Said Dyantyi: “That improvement goes on with what we do with coach Stick in the training ground. He is head of the ball and works very hard, with the video analysis and making sure we put in a lot of effort.” The Boks leave for Argentina today for the second match in Mendoza on Saturday. Coach Rassie Erasmus confirmed Elton Jantjies will go on tour as part of the 28-man touring squad. “We will make a few changes and there will definitely be a difference to the 28 that go on tour,” Erasmus said. “We will select a different team with four or five changes when we go over there.”
