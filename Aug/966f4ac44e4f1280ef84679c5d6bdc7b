KHENSANI Maseko was an inspiration to her family and also to many others. This was what family member Sindiso Maseko said yesterday in a letter she read at the funeral of the 23-year-old Rhodes University student, who took her own life last week. “In our family, among our friends, they all looked up to you. So today I want to thank God for the 23 years he gave us to share. During this time, we shared rich and profound memories and I will hold those for as long as I live,” she read. Khensani was laid to rest at the Nasrec Memorial Park, nearby Soweto. It is suspected she committed suicide on Friday after battling depression. She had been raped in May. Rhodes University Vice-Chancellor Dr Sizwe Mabizela said boys should be raised to respect women. He also said Khensani’s death should force South Africa to pause and reflect on the society we had become. EFF Gauteng chairwoman Mandisa Mashego said universities and the SAPS were to blame for what happened to Khensani. “Our children are getting raped at universities, taxi ranks and on the streets. This happens in broad daylight,” she said.
