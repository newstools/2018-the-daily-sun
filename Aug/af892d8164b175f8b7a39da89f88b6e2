THE vicious dogs have sent several of their kasi neighbours to hospital. So on Monday morning residents of Micha View in North West made their feelings clear when they handed over a memorandum of grievances to the SPCA and cops. They wanted the killer dogs out of their kasi in seven days! The angry residents said the latest two incidents happened on Monday morning when residents were attacked by a neighbour’s dogs. They said it wasn’t the first time. They had asked the owner several times to remove his dogs. One of the victims, Bless Sefora (62), said he was walking to his place when the dogs attacked him. “Three dogs came at me and bit my hands and leg,” he said. Another one, Jan Malete (67), said he was on his way to the shops when the dogs attacked him. “They sneaked up on me. I didn’t even see them coming. Next thing I was covered in blood,” said Jan. Community leader Maria Sithole (45) said: “These creatures are a danger to the community. We want the SPCA to take them away.” SPCA inspector Mishack Matlou said the owner of the dogs wasn’t at his house, and neither were the three pit bulls. “Residents should open a case against the owner and a magistrate will have to decide wether the dogs have to go or not.”
