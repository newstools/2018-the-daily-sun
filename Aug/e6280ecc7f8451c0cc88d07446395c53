RUN-flat tyres are popular safety features on many cars. They reduce the need to stop immediately if a tyre is damaged. When do run-flat tyres work? When a run-flat tyre gets a puncture, you have enough time to drive your car to the closest garage or tyre replacement place. However, run flats last only for 80km and can’t be driven faster than 80km/h. How do run-flat tyres work? Run flats have stronger sidewalls – often steel re-inforced. They provide shape and support when the tyre is punctured. The manufacture of run flats make them more expensive than regular tyres. How do run-flat tyres benefit you? If your tyre is damaged, run flats provide more stability than a regular tyre. The run flat does not force to park on the side of a road to replace it or wait for help.
