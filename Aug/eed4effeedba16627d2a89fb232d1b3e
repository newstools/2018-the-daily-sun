TUCKSHOP owner Musa Nene says a loud knock woke him up on Monday. Musa, from Machobeni in Durban, said two men arrived at his rented house, claiming to be cops searching for drugs. When the 29-year-old heard they were cops, he quickly opened the door. He didn’t know they were bogus cops trying their luck. “When they knocked, I decided to phone my uncle who lives a few houses away to come because there were cops at the house. “I switched on the lights so I could open the door but they shouted that I should switch them off.” Musa said he then peeped through the door and saw them dressed in uniform and opened up. “They got inside, pushed me to the floor, opened my fridge and asked for beer. They told me they were searching for drugs and dagga. I told them I only sell chips and sweets. He said one of them threw his chips outside and said he would take them. “I then realised they were bogus cops who were not carrying guns. “By that time, my uncle had entered the house and I grabbed one of them by the neck.” He said his uncle caught the other. “We shouted for help and residents came out. We saw one was wearing a police jacket, cap and sandals. The other was wearing a bulletproof vest and cap and a belt.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said two suspects, both aged 28, were arrested for robbery and impersonating cops. “They will appear in Ntuzuma Magistrates Court soon and will be profiled for similar incidents.”
