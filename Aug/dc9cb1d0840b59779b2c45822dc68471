PIT toilets in rural schools were declared an embarrassment and made headlines. But despite the outcry and finger pointing, nothing has been done to sort this out. No one has ever seen a pit toilet in Mzansi’s city schools, but it’s the only relief for thousands of pupils in rural areas. The toilets pose a risk to people’s health and lives, and those who have survived are left embarrassed. Many cases of rural pupils being rescued from pit toilets during school hours were reported. Eastern Cape child rights activist Petros Majola laid the blame at the door of the education department. Majola told Daily Sun: “Eastern Cape Basic Education Department has failed dismally to put in place even minimum standards for public school infrastructure. “They kept promising they will fix the problem but continued to delay upgrades.” Majola also told of his shock when he found a girl child from a high school in Dutywa nearly drowned when she fell into a pit latrine. “She hated herself and was in tears as she told her story, especially the part where the other children laughed at her. “Luckily for her, she was saved as people managed to pull her out of the toilet that was almost full. “She changed schools to hide from those who made a joke of her pain. “Our child rights organisation, Khula Community Development Project, met with her and referred her to social development and counselling sessions.” Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima promised there was a plan in place to improve the situation. “Our focus is on using implementing agents like Amatola Water Board to deliver water and sanitation to these areas, to get rid of pit latrines and build water-borne solutions,” he said.
