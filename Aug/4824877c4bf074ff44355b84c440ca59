SELLING expired food to customers is illegal but it is happening across kasis. But if the “officials” from the Foreign Shops Operators Association had their way, it would soon be a thing of the past. There’s just one little problem. The association is not a registered by-law enforcement agency. However, that is not stopping them from going ahead. The association’s director, Njabulo Hadebe (50), invited Daily Sun to come along and watch them in action. Hadebe said he formed this organisation to make sure that shop owners were regulated and followed by-laws within the health sector. “My partner and I attend research meetings in hospitals and we found that many infants from birth to five months old were getting sick from food poisoning. “Even older people are affected. We aim to reduce the number of expired items on spaza shop shelves,” said Hadebe. The association was operating in Diepkloof’s zone 3, Soweto. Officials went from one shop to another checking for expired food. “So far we have gone to three shops. In all of them we found expired food – from dried milk that expired in June last year to tins of food.” But the spokesman for Joburg Municipality’s environmental health department, Peter Manganye said what the association was doing was illegal. “Only the municipality and the health department can appoint such people knowing that they have the relevant qualifications. Their initiative is good but it’s questionable.” Hadebe hit back, saying: “We had an hour- long meeting with their operational manager who told us that she would arrange a meeting with her superiors for us to come and present our structure. “They are afraid that we will expose them for not doing their job. We are a registered private company and we are here to stay.”
