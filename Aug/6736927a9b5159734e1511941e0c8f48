ANNANIA Ngobeni is a worried gogo who cannot sleep at night. The 84-year-old from Marite Village outside Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga said it has been 30 years since her daughter disappeared. “My daughter, Alice Ngobeni, has been missing for many years and I do not know if she is still alive or not,” said the gogo. She said that at the time Alice left, she was 22 years old. “She told me she was going back to her home, and that was the last time I saw her. “Her neighbours and some relatives said Alice had gone to Mozambique with a man called James Chauke,” gogo Annania told Daily Sun. “I have tried to trace her, but it is difficult because I do not even have a photo of her I can show to people. “I am worried because I am old and can die at any time without seeing my daughter.” The gogo said she had consulted several sangomas and prophets, but she could not get help. “I cannot sleep at night and it is even difficult to eat. “Since my daughter left, my life has never been the same,” she said. “She disappeared just after the death of her father. “It was a double pain for me.” The gogo’s granddaughter, Pretty Ngobeni (29) said they were worried about her health. “Gogo sometimes cries when she talks about Alice,” Pretty said. The gogo never opened a missing person case, but is asking anyone who might have information to contact Pretty on 082 561 8440.
