One man was killed and 17 others injured following a
collision between a car and a taxi on Hendrik Potgieter Road in Strubens
Valley, west of Joburg on Friday. ER24 paramedics, along with several other services,
arrived on the scene to find the taxi lying on its side of the side of the
road. The light motor
vehicle was found parked a short distance away with significant damage to the
left side. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said that upon closer
inspection, paramedics found the male driver lying trapped inside the light
motor vehicle. The driver of the taxi was lying motionless in the rear
of the vehicle while another patient was found lying trapped inside. Paramedics assessed the patients and found that the taxi
driver had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for him and he was
declared dead. The driver of the light motor vehicle, as well as the
trapped patient inside the taxi, were found to be in a serious condition.
Rescue services had to use specialized tools to free the two trapped patients. Once freed, both patients were treated and provided with
advanced life support interventions. Fifteen other patients were assessed and found to have
sustained minor to moderate injuries. The patients were treated for their
injuries and were thereafter transported to nearby hospitals for further
treatment. Local authorities were on the scene for further
investigations.
