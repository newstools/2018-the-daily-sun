AN exhausted taxi driver handed over the driving to his
bewildered passenger when he confessed that he just “can’t go on anymore”. According to Coconuts,
Santiphap Khunchanmee was taking a ride in Bangkok on Thursday when things got
a little weird. Santiphap wrote about the conversation he and the taxi
driver had on Facebook. “Bro, I can’t go on anymore. I’m too sleepy. Let me park
and take a little nap during this red light,” said the taxi driver to
Santiphap. Santiphap asked, “Should I drive?” The sleepy taxi driver responded, “I was hoping you’d
offer.”
