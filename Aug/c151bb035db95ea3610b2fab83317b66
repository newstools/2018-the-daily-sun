EVERY month, an SMS notifies Sibusiso Mnguni when his salary has been paid into his account. But he can’t withdraw the money – he doesn’t have a bank card. Sibusiso claims his older brother tore up his ID and bank card after he refused to give him money. Now Sibusiso needs a new ID to get another bank card. Sibusiso (39) works as a cleaner at Nomnekane Primary School in Devon, Vaal. He said he applied for an ID in September, but was unsure when it would be issued. The father of three said he had been working for more than seven months without being able to access his salary. “My heart breaks when I receive the SMS notification,” he told Daily Sun. He said he had explained the problem to his branch, but he was told there was nothing they could do. The law required him to produce an ID before another card was issued. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola promised to send officials to look into the matter.
