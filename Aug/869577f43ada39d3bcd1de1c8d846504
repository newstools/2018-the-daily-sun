IT HAS been almost three months since Vuma Mhlanga was expelled from school. The 16-year-old from Moloto Village, near Kwamhlanga in Mpumalanga said he now spends his days sitting at home worrying about his future. The grade 8 pupil told Daily Sun he was expelled from Matimba Middle School after the principal allegedly accused him of stealing R25 from another pupil. However, he said he knew nothing about the theft and just wanted to go back to school. His father Saddam Mhlanga (58) said he tried to talk to the principal but she didn’t listen to him. “I tried to talk to the principal but she doesn’t want my son back at school. All the pupils she brought forward as witnesses denied seeing him take the money.” Vuma said the principal allegedly accused him of belonging to a gang. “The day before I was expelled she called the cops. They put me in the back of a van and drove to a gravesite where they assaulted me.” Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the boy should have opened a case at the police station. Mpumalanga Education Department spokesperson, Gerald Sambo said they are going to investigate the matter. “Be that as it may, the only person who has the right to expel pupils is the head of department after receiving a written recommendation from the school. “No principal has the authority to expel a pupil from school without approval from the HOD,” he said.
