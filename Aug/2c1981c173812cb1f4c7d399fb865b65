AMAZULU players are eager to get the ball rolling. They kick off their Absa Premiership campaign against Baroka FC at King Zwelithini Stadium, Umlazi, tomorrow (8.15pm). The stadium was a good hunting ground for Usuthu last season and fan favourite Jabulani Ncobeni hopes they can pick up where they left off. He says their target is to finish the season in the top six. Said Ncobeni: “We hope our good run last season will come into play. The good thing is that we are playing a team we are familiar with.” “Baroka attack a lot and they know how to put pressure on their opponents. They attack with five and use the same number of players in defence. It’s going to be tough to crack them but we are ready.” Ncobeni’s first season in the top flight since 2015 when he played for Golden Arrows was hampered by injury, but he did enough to impress Usuthu faithfuls. He started last season injured after joining Usuthu from Thanda Royal Zulu and got another knock against Kaizer Chiefs halfway through (in November), which sidelined him again for a while. Now fit again, the midfielder has vowed to be a better player to help Usuthu achieve more than they did last season. “Enough rest has done wonders for me. I did feel a bit drained after playing all 30 matches for Thanda. “I had no time to rest when I joined AmaZulu for pre-season. Injuries also slowed me down. But now I’m back to full fitness. I hope to have a good season and score a few goals for the team,” added Ncobeni. .
