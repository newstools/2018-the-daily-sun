AN ANGRY wife who has been refusing to poke her husband
has pleaded to remain married to him because she says she loves him. According to Punch, Waheed Ajao (49) has been married to
his second wife Monsurat Ajao (38) for 19 years. They have five kids together. But this week he approached the Islamic customary court
in Lagos, Nigeria because he just can’t go on being married to a woman who
refuses to have sex with him. He also claims that Monsurat regularly threatens his
life. Waheed told the court: “My marriage with Monsurat had
been turbulent and fraught with fights and quarrels; I don’t have peace of
mind. “Monsurat is always threatening my life with weapons and
I am afraid she may hurt me one day. “She is so troublesome that she fights a lot with my
other wives. “Please court, end this loveless marriage so that I can
have peace in my life and live long on earth to eat the fruit of my labour.” Waheed said he also wants a divorce because his wife
comes and goes without asking his permission. But Monsurat said the reason she denies her husband sex
is because he doesn’t like the way he treats her and their kids. “My husband showers love on his other wives than me.
Despite being the second wife, I enjoy nothing. “He has refused to buy me a mattress, I sleep on wood.
Waheed always buys things for his other wives’ children but will not buy for my
children,” Monsurat said. Despite this, Monsurat claims she still loves her husband
and does not want a divorce. The Islamic customary court ruled that a divorce would be
granted a year from now if Monsurat does not change her ways.
