SISANA Tekani (75) asked a simple question during parliament’s land expropriation committee hearings in Rustenburg, North West. She wanted to know how government can claim to control land when they build RDPs in vacant bushveld. After the hearings, the SunTeam visited the community of Welverdiend and was shocked by what they saw. While many elderly people have been on waiting list for years, it seems government has no problem with empty RDPs. In the bush outside the village are several unused toilets. “One resident said: “These are built for the coming generations. We were told they are for kids who are yet to be born.” Some of the houses in the village do not have electricity. Residents claimed some people were deliberately left in the dark because of political divisions. The biggest shock was Sisana’s story. When construction for approved beneficiaries began, her house was built in her neighbour’s yard. To rub salt in the wound, the RDP was marked 10240, the number assigned to Sisana. When she complained, a steel plate was placed over the number. Sisana claimed Moses Kotane Municipality keeps telling her she already owns an RDP. Municipal spokeswoman Beauty Makganye said the approved beneficiary list was housed at the department of human settlements, and the municipality only facilitated subsidy applications. Makganye said the gogo’s application for an RDP was never been approved and produced a beneficiary list to back up her claims. “The municipality will engage the provincial department to reconsider her application.” Attempts to get answers from provincial housing spokesman Ben Bole failed.
