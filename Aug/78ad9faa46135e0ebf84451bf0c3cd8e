WHENEVER traffic lights go down, chaos and road rage follow. But this problem has now led to a local inventor designing a solution set to bring massive relief to motorists in Mzansi. It’s time to say hello to the temporary traffic lights solution. Brian Kolisa from Cosmo City, Joburg told Daily Sun thathe too knew the frustration of waking up early, only to reach your destination late. “When traffic lights are out, it causes total chaos on roads,” said Kolisa. He said his temporary traffic lights used battery power that lasted for 48 hours without dimming or malfunctioning in any way. He is also planning to extend the battery use time. “The lights are moveable, so it will be easy to remove them at night to avoid theft. “They also contain a data logger that helps to log current time and the status of the traffic light,” he said. Furthermore, the traffic lights include a 360° camera to provide authorities with data in case of an accident. Kolisa said he sacrificed a lot of time and effort to see this project through and added that he had no regrets as he was sure someone would fund it. “I had to sell my car to fund the prototype and other processes involved in the final product. “I had a vision and I had to make sure it came to life,” he told the People’s Paper. He believes his invention could create a lot of jobs as well. “Someone will fund my project. I just need to keep the faith and believe my vision is clear to others.”
