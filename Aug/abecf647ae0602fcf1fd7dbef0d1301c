SUNLANDERS expect their hard-earned tax money to help build a better Mzansi for all. But unfortunately this is not always the case. On Saturday afternoon people from Morolong kasi in Thaba Nchu watched in shock as a marked police van was used to deliver furniture. The van carried the sign of the Thaba Nchu cop shop commander. “Our taxes are being wasted and misused by government officials,” one resident said. Angry residents said every time they complain at the cop shop, they are told no vans are available. The SunTeam spotted the van carrying two wooden cupboards and being offloaded at a house near Albert Moroka School. Sello Moduka (22) said the cops were using state resources for themselves. “These vans are not made to take the cops’ children to school or their spouses to work. “They are not meant to deliver groceries or even move furniture from one place to another. “These vans are meant to serve us, the residents,” he said. Nthabiseng Molelekeng (38) of Selosesha kasi said she was starting to lose faith in Mzansi’s police system. “A big part of our salaries is deducted for tax, and during returns SARS gives us only a small refund. “The rest of the money is supposed to be used for the country’s resources, such as police vans. It is sad to see cops misusing our tax money. “There is no order in the department where needed,” she said. “If you report a matter at the cop shop, you are told all the vans are out. “They are out – but to check on their nyatsis and do shopping.” Sergeant Martin Xuma said the cops were aware that furniture was being moved using the Thaba Nchu cop shop’s state vehicle. Xuma told Daily Sun: “The vehicle was moving old furniture, as the station management are renovating the holding cells. It was being taken to a reservist member’s home after proper disposal processes were followed.”
