A PICTURE of the EFF’s flag allegedly being flown at a cop shop in Limpopo has set tongues wagging on social media. It is not yet known when the flag was hung, but the picture started doing the rounds on Saturday. A group of people, including cops and people wearing EFF berets and jackets are seen standing around a flag pole. The flag is displayed next to the SAPS and South African flags. This picture shocked many people, but the EFF’s provincial secretary, Jossey Buthane, said there was nothing wrong with it. “We cannot blame those comrades for being creative. “What they did is not a crime. They saw that the police and South African flags were looking dull and they added some flavour. The party has been receiving criticism, but we are not bothered,” said Buthane. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said they were investigating the matter. “We do not know which police station this is, but a full and thorough investigation is under way. More detailed information will be revealed in due course,” he said.
