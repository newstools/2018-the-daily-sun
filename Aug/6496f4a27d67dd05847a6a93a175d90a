RESIDENTS of extension 15 in Cala, Eastern Cape are still reeling in shock after a newborn baby was eaten by pigs. Businesswoman Nolusindiso Zwana (32) said she was shaken by the incident. She runs a tavern in the area and the baby was abandoned near her tavern. “On Monday morning, I received a phone call to say there was something near my tavern. “When I got there, the baby was covered with a plastic refuse bag. Pigs arrived and ate his head. I’m not sure whether he was abandoned dead or alive,” she told Daily Sun. She said the incident has left her with a desire to open an orphanage. “This incident is very painful. Now I’m busy trying to get things done to open an orphanage. People who don’t want their kids must bring them to me.” Nolusindiso said she loved children and it hurts her when a child is abused. She said anyone who wanted to assist with the orphanage is welcome to do so. Police spokeswoman Captain Namhla Mdleleni said: “We have opened a case of concealment of birth. No one has been arrested yet. Police are busy with investigations.”
