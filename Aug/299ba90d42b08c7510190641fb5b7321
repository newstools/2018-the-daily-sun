FUNANI Makhathini and her family are suffering. The 94-year-old gogo, her daughter and seven grandkids live in a one-roomed mud house in Edengeni Village, northern KZN. Her neighbour Chris Ntshangase (45) told Daily Sun life was hard for Funani and her family. He said they urgently needed help from Good Samaritans. “Gogo needs a proper house. For the past seven years, the family have been living in a mud house. “The condition of the structure is bad. Her granddaughter often collects gogo Funani’s grant money and that of her daughter, who’s living with a disability. “She buys them groceries, but the food doesn’t last the family for a month because she keeps the rest.” He said Sassa should do something about the matter. “The granddaughter shouldn’t be allowed to collect the grant money.” Chris said he didn’t where the granddaughter lived. “I don’t have her cell number. All we know is that every time after giving birth, she dumps the baby with gogo,” he said. Vusi Mahaye, a spokesman for Sassa in the province, said: “Gogo must go to a local Sassa office and indicate that she wants her granddaughter to be changed as the grant beneficiary. “The law doesn’t allow us to go to gogo’s home to change a beneficiary.” Ncumisa Ndelu, a spokeswoman for the Social Development Department, said: “I’ve forwarded the case to our regional office for action. “Pensioners need to be cared for. How do you leave a child with someone who needs care? “It’s unfair on them to be expected to look after kids when they should be enjoying their old age.” Mdu Mcalane, a spokesman for the uMhlathuze Municipality, said: “The municipality, Mhlathuze Water and the tourism department are in the process of building gogo a decent house.”
