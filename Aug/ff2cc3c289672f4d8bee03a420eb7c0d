FORMER ANC MP Mduduzi Manana posted a video in support of the #TotalShutdown march yesterday. However, it came too soon for many as he was slammed by the Commission for Gender Equality. In the 59-second clip posted on Facebook, the former deputy minister of higher education says he wants to show his solidarity with the march against violence against women. Manana stepped down as an MP last week before he was due to face parliament’s ethics committee to discuss his conviction for assaulting two women last year. Commission spokesman Javu Baloyi said: “We are appalled by the reckless behaviour of Mduduzi Manana. We believe that even if it’s a noble cause, it’s too soon for him to be associated with fighting gender-based violence.” Baloyi said the commission believed Manana needed to be rehabilitated before he could make comments on the issue. “As a commission, we believe he’s ill advised and must learn to take steps that are geared towards ensuring he has rehabilitated himself,” he said. “Gender-based violence issues are not something to make a mockery of and we believe if he meant well, he would seek assistance from gender institutions. “It’s too soon for him to be participating.” Baloyi also recommended that Manana interact with men’s forums. “We condemn the video he posted on Facebook and we believe he needs to engage with men’s forums such as the Commission of Gender Equality so he can be sensitised about gender issues.”
