Local funeral home, Doves has deleted and apologized for a tweet that has caused a bit of controversy. Doves joined in the nation’s cry for Sbahle Mpisane, who has been in hospital fighting for her life, to have a speedy recovery. This after Sbahle was involved in a car accident in KwaZulu-Natal last week. The fitness bunny was in a critical condition in ICU for a few days but is reportedly off of life support. After tweeting that they are also praying for Sbahle, many called the funeral home out for being insensitive and opportunistic. Although just as many people were fine with the post as those who found it distasteful, Doves has since deleted and apologized for the post. “Doves is a corporate citizen & like all South Africans we are concerned about Sbahle’s wellbeing. We share the anxiety for her speedy recovery & wish her well.We acknowledge that some were offended by our tweet but we maintain we meant no harm.We apologize for any offence caused,” they said. Meanwhile, Sbahle's dad has told City Press that they are unhappy with the post. "“It was an opportunistic tweet and it is insensitive that they pounced [on Sbahle’s accident]. There is not much we can say or do now. We are focusing on Sbahle. Maybe at a later stage we will look into it and see what is going to happen," he said.
