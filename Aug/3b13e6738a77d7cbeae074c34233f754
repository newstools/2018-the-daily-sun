Having picked up his first win since taking over at Kaizer Chiefs in their 3-0 MTN8 victory over Free State Stars, Giovanni Solinas expressed his pride. Dumisani Zuma put Amakhosi in front in the 20th minute before second half goals from Leonardo Castro and Khama Billiat wrapped up the victory. "I'm very proud of my players. Today the performance is brilliant, we played very well," Solinas told SuperSport after the game. "We deserve to win this game; now we focus on the next game and continue to work hard because the road is still long." Even so, the Italian tactician admitted that there is room for the Glamour boys to improve. "Kaizer Chiefs need to play attacking football, play the whole 90 minutes with the same idea," he said. "We need to improve and I'm very confident with the future because the players are training hard and putting in the effort." Amakhosi will return to action against Baroka on Tuesday evening as they look to pick up their first Premiership victory of the season, having drawn 1-1 to Mamelodi Sundowns and lost 3-1 to Bidvest Wits.
