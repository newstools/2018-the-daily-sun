NEIGHBOURS are quick to complain that there’s too much noise when there’s a party and loud music. But Martha Chokwe has been told she sounds too loud when praying! The 62-year-old from New Eersterust, Tshwane, said she was living in fear after her neighbours gave her a hard time. Gogo Martha insisted that the same annoying prayers had prevented the neighbours from harming her family. “One of my neighbours once came to my house to tell me I should stop praying so much because it irritated them,” she said. She said people ekasi insulted her and some called her evil because they once saw her sprinkling holy water in her yard. Martha said she resorted to using the holy water after finding cow intestines and animal bones scattered all over the yard. “Last Friday, community members held a meeting next to my gate,’ she said. “I fear that if these lies don’t stop, something bad will happen to me and my kids.” But neighbour Johanna Maluleka said Martha was antisocial. “We never called her a bad person,” Johanna told Daily Sun. “We went to her house to find out why she was refusing to talk to us.” They wanted to know why Martha’s kids were not allowed to play with theirs.
