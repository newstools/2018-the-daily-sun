ONE person has died after student protest flared up the
Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) Soshanguve North Campus. The protest broke out amongst students who were there to
elect a new Student Representative Council (SRC). The chaos allegedly began when the results were announced
and some alleged that the results were rigged. TUT allege that the police fired live ammunition at the
students. However, the police that were deployed to the protests at
the TUT say they fired their ammunition at the ground, and there was no one who
was injured when they left.
