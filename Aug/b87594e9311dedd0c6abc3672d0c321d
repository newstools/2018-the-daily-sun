A TEACHER (55) from a School in Mayville, Durban desperately needs help. She told Daily Sun her principal would not allow her to use the toilet. Joyce Mchunu claims she has been abused by the principal since 2016 and felt she had to tell the public before she died. The diabetic Mchunu said she had been in and out of hospital because of the abuse she suffered at school. She claims the principal started targeting her soon after he joined the school in 2016. She said one day she bumped into the principal on her way to the toilet and he allegedly told her she was not allowed to leave her pupils alone to go to relieve herself. “He told me whenever I wanted to go to the toilet, I should sign the register. “But other teachers do not sign that register,” said Joyce. “I was called in by the teacher who is in charge of our foundation phase. That teacher told me the principal instructed her to ensure that I always sign the register if I wanted to go to the toilet, but I refused to sign. “I suffered from stress after that and was admitted to hospital. I have a serious problem and need help because I have reported the matter to my union and to the department, but no one is helping.” She also claims the principal allegedly told the security guard to lock her out if she was late by even one minute. She claimed other teachers told her the principal wanted her to leave because she was close to the acting principal. The principal declined to comment on Tuesday when Daily Sun visited the school. “I have no comment on the matter. If you put my name in the story there will be consequences,” the principal said. Sihle Mlotshwa, a spokesman for the KZN Education Department, said the teacher should visit the district director. The department took the matter seriously.
