INCREDIBLE Happenings Ministries leader Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng has joined the chorus calling on the country’s leaders to forgive students implicated in the #FeesMustFall protests. Mboro came said yesterday mistakes were made by all but that God forgives. He said all students who took part in the protests should be granted presidential pardon because they were fighting a good cause. “There wouldn’t have been a need for the protest if the education system was properly implemented.” He told Daily Sun he was responding to the needs of the #FeesMustFall activists after they asked for his help while camping outside the Union Buildings in Tshwane. He said his church on Sunday delivered tents, food and mobile toilets to activist Bonginkosi Khanyile, his mum, and the rest of the activists. Khanyile had asked for Mboro’s help because he was accessible. Khanyile was found guilty on charges of public violence, failure to comply with police instruction and possession of a dangerous weapon.
