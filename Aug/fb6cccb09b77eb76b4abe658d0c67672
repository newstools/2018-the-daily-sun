PROVINCIAL government leaders arrived in Kanyamazane yesterday to talk to the kasi’s residents. But the leaders, including Mpumalanga’s premier, Refilwe Mtshweni, were turned away by the angry people. The residents have been protesting for the past three days. They have accused the human settlements department of failing to fix more than 2 000 RDP houses damaged in May by heavy rain. The residents said they did not want to be addressed by Mtshweni, because she would “only tell them more lies”. One resident said: “We are tired of their lies. We do not want to hear anything from the premier. “They must bring President Cyril Ramaphosa here. “He might be able to solve our problems. We do not want to listen to Mtshweni because she did not take our matter seriously from the beginning.” Mtshweni tried to speak to the residents, but they kept on singing struggle songs and ignored her. The premier said they managed to talk to some of the residents, but others were not willing to listen to them. “We are still available at any given point to talk to the residents, when they are ready to engage us,” Mtshweni said. “We will pass the message to the president’s office, and if he is willing to come we will accompany him here.” Mpumalanga Police Commissioner Mondli Zuma said the police would stay in the area to monitor the situation.
