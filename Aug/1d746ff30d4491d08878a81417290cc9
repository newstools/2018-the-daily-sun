STREET vendors abandoned their stock on the pavements, pedestrians ran into stores and motorists stopped dead in their tracks. Chaos erupted in busy Paul Kruger Street in Tshwane on Tuesday afternoon as a man committed suicide in full view of onlookers. As if first firing a parting shot, the man narrowly missed a vendor when he fired off his gun in his car. The second shot, however, hit its target. According to one of the witnesses, no one suspected anything when the man parked his car and got out. Onlookers claimed after the man got back in his car, bullets started flying. “The first shot he fired missed a vendor and hit a store. The second bullet hit him and he collapsed in his car,” said another witness. No one knew who the man was and why he killed himself in the middle of town. It was later established by the police that the man was one of their own. The vendor who just missed being shot was too shaken to speak to the SunTeam. He was being comforted by people around him. Another vendor, Mercy Gurira (37), said she was shocked and felt lucky to be alive. “His car was parked right in front of where I sell my stock. I dropped my money and all my stock when he fired the first bullet. I ran like I had never run before,” she said. Police spokeswoman Captain Augustine Selepe said the man was an off duty cop stationed at Springs. She said they’ve opened an inquest docket to establish the cause of his death. “The man was found dead inside his brother’s Opel Corsa bakkie with a wound to his head.”
