COPS are hunting for a group of men who smashed up a BMW
with baseball bats in a busy city street on Sunday – with a male driver and his
young son inside. According to The
Sun, there were gasps of shock from eyewitnesses as the thugs repeatedly
slammed the car with their bats. Cops have called it a “targeted attack”. One man has been
arrested and cops are hunting the rest. Both the traumatised driver and the boy were slightly
injured in the vicious attack.
