AS a schoolboy, Lunati Mfubesi vowed he would one day help kids to get to their matric dances. These days the 36-year-old from Khayelitsha in Cape Town is an engineer with four flashy cars, and he has honoured his promise, transporting pupils to matric dances since 2014. Lunati told Daily Sun: “I told myself, when I make it I will take pupils to their dances to make their day special.” But there is a catch! “The pupil has to be doing well at school and needs to display good behaviour. I check their progress with their parents,” he said. Lunati said he preferred to transport girls as they were vulnerable to older men. “I also help them apply for tertiary. I can’t explain the feeling I have when I see families happy because of what I do.” Phumlani Moya (17) went to her matric dance at Harry Gwala Secondary School in one of Lunati’s cars on Friday. “I felt like a celebrity,” she said. Her mum, Nobuntu, said Lunati didn’t only come with a car but also brought a make-up artist. “May he continue doing what he does. God will bless him,” she said.
