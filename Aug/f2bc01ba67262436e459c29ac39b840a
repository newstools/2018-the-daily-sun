A once off cash payment of R10 000 after tax for all employees in the Bargaining Forum is to be made within 48 hours of signing. The housing allowance will be increased by CPI for each year of the wage agreement. The conditions of service will remain unchanged for the period 1 July 2018 – 30 June 2021.
