The queen B* is spitting fire this afternoon and no one is safe. The media darling, Bonang Matheba, has kindly let a hater know where he can shove his negative comments about her mother. So here’s what went down: KayaFM announced yesterday that Bonang’s mom, Charlotte Mokoena, the Executive Vice-President for Human Resources and Corporate Affairs at Sasol, would be joining Mapaseka Mokwele on her show for a feature they call #BlackGirlMagic. Bonang obviously retweeted the tweet and asked her millions of adoring fans to tune in and hear her mother share her life story. Everything was well and good, until…. “Is she responsible for administering "Golden handshakes" for non performing officials and employing ANC cadre CEOs with no experience and qualifications and paying them aexcesive salaries??? ...just asking for a friend??? I am sure she is a very nice person though,” responded a guy named Alfred Newman‏. The queen quickly fired back and came to her mom’s rescue. “Oh Alfred. Feel free to fuck off,” sending him off on his merry way.
