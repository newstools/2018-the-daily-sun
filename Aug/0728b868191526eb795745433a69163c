A married couple that wanted a baby and were failing to
conceive have been told they were having sex the wrong way for four years. The couple who are between the ages of 26 and 24, wanted
professional advice after not being able to make a baby, although they were
having sex regularly. When they consulted a doctor, the alarm bells rang because
it was discovered the wife was a virgin. According to the Mirror,
she told the doctor that sex was "usually painful" for her every
time. "Their family was giving them a lot of stress because
of it," she added. While asking about the wife's medical history during the
visit, Liu was told that the couple had sex regularly. The woman's symptoms led to the doctor to believe that she
may have had some sort of gynaecological disease. But Obstetrician Liu Hongmei said she was
"shocked" when an examination revealed the wife was still a virgin. According to China's Guiyang Evening Post, Liu's
"experience" led her to inspect the woman's anus. It was then that the doctor discovered the couple had been
mistakenly having anal sex for four years, resulting in their failure to
conceive. Doctor Liu reportedly handed the couple, from Bijie city in
China's south-western Guizhou province, each a sex-education handbook. She also gave them "guidelines" before they were
sent home. The advice appeared to work, as news of the wife's pregnancy
arrived just a few months later.
