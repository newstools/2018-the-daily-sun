DEFIANT land invaders on the vacant land at the prison are determined that they will not move. “We don’t care who owns the land. Government will have to pay the owner of the land because we’re not going anywhere,” said one of the land grabbers. People have been erecting shacks on vacant land at Odi Correctional Services in Mabopane, Tshwane since the beginning of this month. One of the leaders told Daily Sun  people had to pay R120 to register for a stand. “When you want space, you write down your name and number and pay R120. Then we call you back so you can erect your shack,” she said. She did not say by who’s authority she was allocating the land or what happened to the money. The happy residents said they were backyarders who were tired of paying landlords exorbitant rentals. Thandi Maupanaga (33) said: “We want land to build our own houses, that’s all. We need a decent place for our kids.” The municipality and the mayor’s office had not responded by the time of going to print.
