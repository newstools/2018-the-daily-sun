THE family of Lethukuthula Ngobese (21), who was kidnapped and killed last year, said they were not entirely happy with the sentence handed down to the convicted killer on Tuesday. Mthunzini High Court convicted and sentenced Bhekuyise Mngoma (52) to life imprisonment for murder and five years for kidnapping. Lethukuthula, who was a third year bachelor of law student at the University of Zululand, disappeared on 29 July last year after attending a graduation party in the Esikhaleni area. She was originally from Emadadeni in Newcastle but stayed in the students’ residence. It isn’t clear exactly when she was killed but her body was found on 2 September in the house of the accused after residents notified the cops of the strange smell coming from the house. When the cops got inside to check, they found Lethukuthula’s decomposed body. Her dad, Dalifa Ngobese said (43) said they were happy the accused got a life sentence for murder and five years for kidnapping but they had hoped he would also be convicted and sentenced for raping his daughter. “The DNA samples were taken for tests because it emerged she might’ve been raped before she was murdered but we didn’t hear whether those results came back or not. We wanted him to be sentenced for that too,” said Dalifa. He said they hoped the killer would learn a lesson from the long sentence. “When he killed my daughter, he was out on parole for multiple murder, rape and armed robbery cases. “He’s a real thug but we hope he’s going to learn from his conviction,” Dalifa said. KZN NPA spokesman Natasha Kara said: “If the family has a query regarding a charge that never emerged during trial, I would advise them to raise it with the cops. “After the cops have given us proof that the victim was raped, we can take it from there.”
