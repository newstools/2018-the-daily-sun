RESIDENTS received a strong warning against burning property during protests. Mpumalanga Health MEC Sasekani Manzini sent a strong message to residents, saying they should not be misled by disgruntled politicians into burning down what the government had built for them. Manzini said this at Ehlanzeni TVET College stadium in Acornhoek on Wednesday as she wrapped up Mandela Month activities. She said some people from opposition parties took advantage of the poor and influenced them negatively during protests. “They need to stop targeting young people by preventing them from attending school and encouraging them to burn property. If you destroy what the government has delivered, it is you who will suffer in the end,” said Manzini. She urged people to visit government offices to raise their concerns rather than resorting to violence.
