WHEN mechanic Reginald Funeka moved his workshop to a new place, he thought his business would grow. But instead, on Friday everything in his workshop was broken. The 47-year-old father of three is from Dark City in Bloemfontein. He told Daily Sun he worked from his home for 22 years when he decided to move to an open space near a main road three weeks ago. Reginald said a few days after he started working next to the main road, his plan worked and he attracted more clients. However someone destroyed the workshop last week while he was out of town. Reginald said he lost tools worth about R150 000. “I regret the day I decided to move my business as even my clients’ parts were destroyed,” said Reginald. He said he didn’t know what to do as he relied on the business to feed his family. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sinah Mpakane said a case of burglary was being investigated but no arrests had yet been made.
