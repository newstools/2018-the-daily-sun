DANCING, music and food were all there when women celebrated each other on Saturday. Gagasi FM’s Shero Awards event was held at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban to celebrate KZN’s amazing women. It was attended by nominees and women from different fields. There were 11 categories and nominees were selected by the listeners, who motivated their choices. Brand manager Phinda Magwaza said they are proud of the awards and they’ve done well. She said it started as a high tea where women met and spoke about their work and other issues. “Last year, we decided instead of just talking, we should start recognising those women who did well. “So we asked our listeners to enter the names of women they believe had performed. “The motivations sent to us were moving and it was challenging to select the winners this year,” Phinda said. She said the icon queen this year was Mama Albertina Sisulu. “One of the important things about Mama Albertina was education,” Phinda said. She said the winners would be profiled on air, where they would get a chance to tell their story. The Public Service category winner was Ushaka Marine World CEO Stella Khumalo from Pinetown. Stella said she was happy to receive her award. “I was told on Thursday that I had been selected. “I don’t know who selected me but I was happy, excited and also humbled by the award,” she said. Mozambique country manager Thobekile Duma, originally from Pietermaritzburg. took the KZN ambassador award. Thobekile said: “I’m overwhelmed and feel proud to have been recognised in my province. “I believe everything starts at home so it makes me proud as my province can see my work and reward me for it.”
