HE MAY be 91 years old but that didnâ€™t stop the court from sending him to jail for the rest of his life. Madala Mdungwa Malinga received 12 life sentences for 12 counts of rape in the Carolina Regional Court on Friday for rapes committed between 2006 and 2007. He received a three year sentence for three assault cases. The court said all the sentences will run at the same time. Malinga, who claimed to be a traditional healer, sexually abused children aged between seven and nine brought to him to be healed. The children slept over at his house so he could perform rituals but he raped them. He was caught when some of the parents noticed strange behaviour from their children and took them for medical examinations. Their co-accused David Makhondo (45) was sentenced to 12 months in prison for theft, suspended for three years. In May 2013, the men gave a lift to an 18-year-old woman who was hitchhiking from KwaMhlanga to Vaalbank. They took her cellphone, cash and her bank card. They then drove to an area near Sun City D Village, where they raped her.
