Mzansi’s hip hop scene is changing and growing fast. The introduction of the first-ever Castle Lite Hip Hop Herstory concert, which has an all-women line-up, will make the world take notice. The concert will take place next Saturday at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand, northern Joburg. This musical experience and campaign will allow open discussions across multiple media platforms within the hip hop fraternity and tell the story of women through their own lens. According to Castle Lite brand director Becky Opdyke, they’ve always been at the frontline of raising the African music flag high. “Herstory is another testament to the progressive nature of the brand,” said Becky. “We will give audiences an extraordinary experience highlighting the role women have played in the evolution of this genre.” The concert will be a fully immersive experience tapping into all pillars of hip hop – from dance and fashion all the way to graffiti and obviously rapping. American rapper Young M.A of triple platinum hit single Ooouuu, radio host Angela Yee of Breakfast Club fame, Queens-born rapper Roxanne Shante are in the line-up. They will share the stage with local heavyweights Nadia Nakai, Rouge, Gigi Lamayne, Dope Saint Jude, Fifi Cooper, Relo of Mzansi’s hip hop crew Skwatta Kamp, Ayanda MVP and many more.
