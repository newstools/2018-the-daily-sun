WHEN their dying mum left the house to her three children, she thought they would share it as a loving family. Instead, the house has set them at each other’s throats! Their mum died six years ago, leaving her house in Lotus Gardens, west of Tshwane, to her three children. Now Peter (47) and Julia Mogolela (44) are accusing their younger sister, Kgolo Mogolela (43), of trying to kick them out. According to Kgolo, however, her siblings are the ones who refuse to live with her. She said she moved out of the house a few years ago, leaving her brother and sister to stay. She claimed that when she came back she found the house in a state of disrepair and her mother’s furniture missing. When she tried to address the matter, her siblings began to fight with her. Kgolo said she did not want anyone to move out, but her siblings should shoulder responsibility for the mess they had created. Julia accused Kgolo of not telling the truth, claiming that ever since she had come back to live in the house she had made life “a living hell”. She accused Kgolo and her niece of stealing her things: “They bring strange men to the house and do nasty things in my presence. When I complain they tell me to move out.” Peter said he had his own house, but was forced to move back because of the abuse Julia was suffering at the hands of Kgolo. “When I am not around, Julia gets harassed. “At least when I am around I am able to protect her.” The siblings are living in the same house but have divided it so they can live separate lives. Their war has even led to court, where it was suggested they sell the house. Kgolo said she asked her siblings to sell their share to her. “They said the house was worth more than what I was willing to pay, despite them having destroyed it,” she said.
