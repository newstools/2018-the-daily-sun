THE case of a murdered albino girl and her nephew is affecting the family emotionally. The case was back in the Witbank Magistrates Court yesterday. Gabisile Shabane (13) and her 15-month-old nephew, Nkosikhona Ngwenya, were kidnapped in January and later found murdered. The family said the case was always being postponed, which hurt them. They said it opened wounds for them and the wait to bury their kids was taking too long. Sibongile Shabane, a family representative, said they were no longer satisfied with the postponement of the case. She said they wanted justice. “We wish the case could just come to an end. We are tired of coming to court only for the case to be postponed. We have also waited too long for the DNA results to be released. “We want closure now and to move on even though we will never forget them,” she said. Gabisile’s mum, Annah Shabane, said she didn’t like the fact that accused Brilliant Mkhize always raised his hand to speak but was ignored by the court. “I want the court to allow him to say what he wants to say in front of us.” Senior prosecutor Fani Mavundla said: “The state is still waiting for the DNA results and the arrival of one of the accused, Mfanasibile Gamedze from Eswatini. The court is satisfied with the progress made to continue with the case.” The case was postponed to 10 October.
