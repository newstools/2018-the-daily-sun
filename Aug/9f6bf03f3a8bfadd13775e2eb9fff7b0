THE Concours d'El√©gance means a "competition of
elegance" and refers to an event where prestigious vehicles are displayed
and judged. It dates back to the 17th century France, where
aristocrats paraded horse-drawn carriages in the parks of Paris during summer
weekends and holidays. Over time, carriages became horseless and the gatherings became
a competition among vehicle owners to be judged on the appearance of their
vehicles. These events are often held at automobile shows, after
racing competitions or, especially in the United States, as a fundraising event
for charities.
