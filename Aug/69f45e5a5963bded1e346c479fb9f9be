LIP SYNC DJ, Player1505, has the whole of Mzansi rolling around laughing. South Africans generally receive collaborations between local and international artists well but Player1505 took it to another level. The 25-year-old from Tsakane in Ekurhuleni, who real name is Smanga Mdaka, makes videos from hit songs and remixes them. His most recent mix was of the Isley Brothers’ song Busted, which he mixes with a question-and-answer session between speaker of parliament Baleka Mbete and former president Jacob Zuma. He makes it seem like the two are a couple having an argument about the other staying out until 2am. “I decided I wanted to use a classic song so I decided the Zuma clip was suitable." He said the video points in a funny way to Zuma’s expected appearance before the state capture commission. The professional video editor and music producer told Daily Sun at first he found it difficult to execute his lip sync videos. “I had come to a point where I felt like I wanted to do something that would inspire others to do the same, and even better.”
