ONE person has been reported dead as tensions rise in the
capital of Zimbabwe, Harare. The army allegedly fired live rounds of ammunition at the protectors. The Zimbabwean army was called to Harare as the supporters of
the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) protested demanding that the results
be released immediately. The cops used teargas to disperse protesters, as the situation
got out of hand. This happened as the Zimbabwean Electoral Commission (ZEC)
was announcing the results.
