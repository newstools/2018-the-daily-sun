RESIDENTS of Protea Glen in Soweto had no electricity for more than a week. Fed up with Eskom’s lack of action, they have now connected the electricity themselves and vowed to do so until Eskom does its work! They also embarked on a protest yesterday, blocking entrances to the kasi with burning tyres and rocks. The residents were protesting against the R6 000 fine Eskom is reported to be demanding from disconnected houses. Resident Betty Mashudu told Daily Sun Eskom disconnected those who paid. Betty said her electricity had been off since last Tuesday, and she has had to throw away most of her food. “My children are getting sick because it is cold and we can’t get heat,” she said. The community also marched to the Eskom power station in Randfontein on the West Rand. “But we did not agree on anything, because Eskom was not negotiating in good faith,” said Protea Glen crisis committee spokesman Phelelani Sindani. “We have given them a memorandum and they have promised to look into it tomorrow. “When they respond we will hold a public meeting with the community to get a fresh mandate,” he said. An Eskom spokesman told Daily Sun all its Protea Glen customers were prepaid. “We audited 101 meters and 59 of them were disconnected due to being tampered with,” he said. He said at this stage they would not attend to any faults reported in the area until it was safe for their workers to go into the area.
