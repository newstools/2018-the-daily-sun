The man who seemingly confessed on Facebook to killing his 21-year-old girlfriend is expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Thabani Mzolo, 23, is accused of shooting dead his ex-girlfriend Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) student Zolile Khumalo.At a previous court appearance, Magistrate Mohamed Motala said some documents, including the post-mortem report and the photo book of the crime scene, still needed to be submitted in court. In the Facebook post, Mzolo wrote in isiZulu: "Konke kwaphenduka umlando ukube benginamandla bengzomvusa silungise amaphutha ngomlomo ...kodwa mnj kuphi laa ngba usehambe wangshiya ngingasashongo ukt ngyamxolela [sic]." Loosely translated, he said: "It is surreal. If I had the power I would bring her back so that we can right our wrongs by talking. But that's no longer possible because she has left me without me having told her that I forgive her." When one of Mzolo's Facebook friends asked him what had happened, he wrote, "Ndoda ngombulele uMy zozo (sic)." (Man, I killed my Zozo). Mzolo, who is a former student at MUT, allegedly shot Khumalo on May 2 at MUT's Lonsdale residence, which is a privately leased residence in the Durban CBD. The court previously heard that the accused has a previous assault conviction.   https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/facebook-murder-student-zolile-khumalos-alleged-killer-back-in-court-20180829
