DURBAN kwaito star Benzy said his unique style and humility has helped him stay relevant in the music industry. Benzy, whose real name is Nkululeko Mpanza, has previously worked with famous artists such as DJ Tira, Big Nuz, Mondli Ngcobo and the late Sir Bubzin. He has been featured on hit songs such as Tira’s Malume Uyalumana and Joocy’s Mzimbo Nemali. He released a single titled Sekusile last month, and is working on shooting a video of the song next month. Benzy told SunBuzz the single is a mix of gqom and Durban kwaito. “I’m so excited because the single has been well received by my fans. “The song is also enjoying a lot of airplay on various radio stations.” I have no doubt the single will keep music fans on their feet this festive season.” Benzy and fellow kwaito artist Mzeykes released a debut album called Benzy noMzeykes in 2008. In 2009 they released a second album titled Second Semester. Benzy told SunBuzz: “Even though many people associate me with Benzy noMzeykes, for now I’ve decided to pursue a solo career. “I am still part of the group but at this stage I want to focus on making my own songs and building my brand. “I’m also planning to release an album and travel the world.”
