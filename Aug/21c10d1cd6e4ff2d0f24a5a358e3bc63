MARITZBURG United and Kaizer Chiefs have something in common: Neither have been able to win a single match in the 2018-19 Absa Premiership season. The two have a date tonight (8.15pm), where all this could change, should the game not end in a draw. The warring sides will clash at Pie­termaritzburg’s Harry Gwala Stadium, with Giovanni Solinas and Fadlu David sitting on opposite benches. The Team of Choice are pointless having lost both their first two league matches to Golden Arrows (2-0) and Free State Stars (2-1), while Amakhosi, playing in their fourth match, have two points from three games following draws with Baroka FC and Mamelodi Sundowns. Chiefs collected a point against Baroka thanks to Siphiwe Tshabalala’s goal, with Bakgaga looking set to walk away with all three points. United captain Siyanda Xulu reckons they can overcome their slump and use Chiefs as a springboard to return to winning ways. Xulu said there isn’t much they need to fix despite the three defeats in a row in all competitions this season. Said the skipper: “What we are going through is common. We can’t solely blame strikers for the slump, we’re a collective.” With Chiefs up next, Xulu hopes their teamwork will prevail: “We need to rectify our goal-scoring conversion rate and ensure we’re on target. “We have had disappointing results so far and it is time to turn things around. “The Chiefs match is the perfect opportunity for us to bounce back. We need the three points.” When the two teams last met at this venue last season, Amakhosi won the match thanks to two goals by Gustavo Paez. Xulu is hoping for a change in fortune this time.
