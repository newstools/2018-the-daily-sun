UNIFORMS, T-shirts, wedding dresses and church gowns – you name it and these women can make it. The members of Ponahatso Primary Co-operative said the demand for their products was so large that they advised other women to follow in their footsteps. The co-operative was started by five passionate women from Zastron, near the border of Lesotho in 2016. Their aim was to reduce poverty and create jobs. Chairwoman Moleboheng Beketsane (53) said: “At the moment we are making school uniforms because they sell like hot cakes. “Our church choir T-shirts cost R200 each while school uniforms go for R120. “The price of a wedding dress starts at R2 500 and graduation gowns cost R420, depending of the design.” She said they would like to expand their business and create more jobs because the orders keep coming in. “I would like to encourage women to do something with their hands so they can support their families. “They should attend business workshops and acquire skills so they can open businesses and change their lives. “We are living in times where practical skills are crucial, which is why women need to acquire them. “We didn’t go to school to learn how to sew and knit. “We were taught by our late parents and that helped us survive hard times. “The co-operative sells its products to the community of Zastron. “We visit Sassa paypoints towards the end of the month and display our products there. “One of the challenges we are facing is a lack of sponsorship. “With the few resources we have, we’ve managed to generate money to pay the rent. “But our business is progressing slowly because we use two old sewing-machines and don’t have enough fabric. “We would appreciate a sponsor so we could buy new sewing-machines to speed up our work.”
