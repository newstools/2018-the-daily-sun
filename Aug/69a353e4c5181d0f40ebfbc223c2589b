FREE State Stars coach Luc Eymael has given former Kaizer Chiefs winger William Twala a lifeline and a chance to prove his worth. Twala was one of 11 new Stars signings confirmed by the club, in addition to experienced Eleazar Rogers and Judas Moseamedi, who joined the Bethlehem outfit on a one-year loan deal. Twala joins Ea Lla Koto after he endured a difficult stay at Amakhosi, where he never truly became a regular, his progress further derailed by injury. The player (28) joined Chiefs in 2016 but was loaned out to Maritzburg United in January before being released in June, shortly after returning from an unproductive six-month loan spell. Although so-called football experts have already written him off, Stars mentor Eymael has a different view. He believes Twala is still a valuable asset that will help the reigning Nedbank Cup champions win a trophy or two this campaign. Ea Lla Koto will kick off their 2018-19 campaign with an away encounter with Bidvest Wits at Milpark’s Bidvest Stadium tomorrow (6pm). “What we saw during our assessment was amazing. We don’t judge him by past seasons, where he struggled. The past is in the past. He has a different coach now, it is a new beginning for him,” said Eymael. “The ball is in his court, he’s injury free and has worked hard at training. “We will see on Saturday if he is in the 18-man squad that will play our first league game.” Eymael vowed to start on a high note to set the tone for the season: “We have a tough fixture, we hope for a good game against Wits. They are tough at home. “We start with three tough encounters – Wits, Maritzburg and Chiefs in the MTN8 quarterfinal, but we want to set the tone. Hopefully we will win one or two titles. But it would be difficult to emulate last season’s performance.”
