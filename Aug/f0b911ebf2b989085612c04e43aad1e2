TWO couples took their lives as twins to the max when
they had a joint wedding during Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, America. According to Daily
Mail, identical twin sisters Brittany and Briana (32) tied their knots with
identical twin brothers Josh and Jeremy Slayers last Saturday dressed in
identical veils, gowns and suits. They were even married by identical twin ministers! They themed their joint wedding “Twice Upon a Time”. Briana told People:
“It's really been a fairytale come true. Marrying twins is something that's
very important to us. “Even when we were little girls I can remember being in
kindergarten, knowing that that is what we saw for ourselves.” Josh and Jeremy said they had no intention of marrying at
all unless they could marry identical sisters, something not that easy to pull
off. But fortune was on their side when they met each other at
last year’s Twins Day Festival, which is the largest annual gathering of twins
in the world. “We were sitting on the bleachers and I saw just these
two amazingly handsome young men that looked to be about our age,” Brittany
told ABC News. After a few dates together, the twin brothers proposed to
the twin sisters on 2 February – chosen specifically because it can be
abbreviated to 2/2. After their delightful wedding day, the two couples are
going to be living in the same house and raising their kids together. “We imagine it will be like two moms and two dads, all raising
our families together,” said Brittany.
