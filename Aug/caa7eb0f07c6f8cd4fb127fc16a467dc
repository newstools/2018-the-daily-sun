A HUSBAND accused of neglecting his first wife has paid a
very high price. The unnamed woman allegedly attacked Yunus Ahmed’s 4-5
with a knife, furious with him for continuously staying with his second wife, Punch is reporting. The drama happened in their home district of Muzaffarnagar
in the north of India on Wednesday. The first wife had apparently consented to Yunus taking a
second wife in 2017, apparently because they didn’t have a son. But the first wife quickly became frustrated and hurt with
Yunus for repeatedly preferring to stay over at his second wife’s house. On Wednesday yet another quarrel about it exploded. Cop Anil Kaparwan said: “On Wednesday, their fight flared
up and the woman, who repeatedly accused him of not spending time with her and
ignoring her, cut his genitals using a knife. “He was rushed to the hospital in a serious condition and
is receiving medical treatment.” The woman faces charges of causing grievous hurt and
bodily harm and could face a maximum of 10 years in jail, police said.
