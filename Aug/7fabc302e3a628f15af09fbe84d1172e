SEVERAL farmers are accusing another farmer of killing 13 of their cows! Heartbroken farmers from Lingelethu in Adelaide, Eastern Cape, said a farmer who lives near their kasi poisoned their cattle after they grazed on his farm. Mphithizeli Mhono said five of his cattle died and two were missing. He said the farmer previously shot at cattle with a pellet gun. “Our hearts are bleeding because some of the cows were pregnant,” he said. “That farmer has an opening in the fence at his farm, which our cattle used to enter. “That opening has been left as a trap to kill our livestock.” Another farmer, Simphiwe Tsani, said three of his cattle were dead and two were missing. He said the cattle started dying on Sunday and this had continued until Tuesday. Other cattle were showing signs of weakness and their pee and waste had turned red. Eastern Cape Rural Development MEC Xolile Nqatha, who visited the area on Tuesday, said: “Our vets took samples and the preliminary report indicated possible poisoning.” A case of animal cruelty was opened against the farmer. Police spokeswoman Captain Lariane Jonker said 13 roaming cattle were found dead on Monday. They belonged to seven local farmers and were worth R149 000.
