WHILE the kids enjoy climbing the trees and the shade, parents and teachers at Luyolo Senior Primary School in Emdeni, Soweto are concerned that the school could collapse at any time. Roots of the trees are growing under the classrooms. SGB chairman Sicelo Langa (30) told Daily Sun although the trees provide shade and look attractive, they pose a danger. “We tried to get the education department to assist us remove some of the trees without success,” he said. Sicelo added that some of the trees were as old as 48 years. “Some of the trees are part of the fence structure, but now their roots are growing under the classrooms and causing cracks. “We fear for the safety of the pupils because the buildings could collapse on top of them.” Sicelo said the trees growing close to the fence are leaning on it, causing it to bend. “We are not asking for much. “We just need the dangerous trees to be removed and the ones close to the school fence to be trimmed.” Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “We are aware of the situation. “Officials have been sent to the school to look into the matter and give an opinion.”
