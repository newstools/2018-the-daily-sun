KZN MEC for Health Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo on Tuesday unveiled 89 new ambulances at Moses Mabhida Stadium, Durban. The ambulances will be distributed to 11 districts across the province. Dhlomo said that the ambulances had been modified to accommodate the resuscitation of a patients and were also equipped to be an ICU on the road. He said this was to ensure a patient who required urgent ICU services wouldn’t have to wait until they arrived at a hospital before getting such treatment. “We are confident that this will not only add value to the fleet, but will also improve patients’ quality of life who need emergency care,” he said. He added that some of the new ambulances would not serve as additions to the current fleet, but would replace those that were no longer fit to be on the road. The department has about 300 ambulances and about 2 500 paramedics across its 11 districts. Each vehicle was worth about R1 million. Dev Gounden (55), who has worked as a paramedic for 32 years in the Ilovu area, south of Durban, said the new fleet would go a long way towards boosting staff morale and services. “Patients will get a better service delivery. The turnaround time will also be quicker,” he said.
