THE high number of abuse cases against women and kids has led to the formation of Banna Kgotla Organisation in Phuthaditjhaba, QwaQwa. Chief Neo Mopeli, the royal house spokesman, said some men don’t respect and protect their families. He said they instead abuse and kill those they are meant to protect. Mopeli said men should understand they lose their dignity by abusing women and children. “The organisation gives men the opportunity to express their side of story and share what led to the abuse.” Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela said: “Some young boys grow up without fathers and never have role models.” She said some mothers are soft when it comes to disciplining their sons, who overpower them and end up doing the same thing in their relationships. “The province fully supports campaigns organised by men who are fighting the abuse of women and children.” Ntombela said men who spend most of their time at taverns should also be involved in these campaigns.
