THE Kouga municipality is making poor farmers poorer by impounding their livestock. This is the claim made by black farmers in Eastern Cape. They say the municipality sells their cattle on auction when they fail to pay the hefty penalty fees. Gatvol farmers from Jeffrey’s Bay, Humansdorp, Thornhill and Uitenhage gathered at the municipal offices in Jeffrey’s Bay on Wednesday. They demanded land on which to farm and graze their animals, arguing that their cattle were impounded if they were found roaming the streets. Eric Mame (49) said he paid R3 800 in October to get his cows back, but two weeks later they were impounded again! He said he did not have the money to get them back. “Growing and selling livestock enables me to feed my family. This is my only source of income. “Our cows are impounded by the same municipality that is refusing to give us land for grazing.” Farmer Sebenzile Thomas (54) paid R4 500 for five of his cows impounded last week. The cattle were released on Tuesday. He told Daily Sun: “The municipality impounds our animals and gives them to a farmer in Lourie. “The farmer charges huge amounts of money for keeping them. The farmers cannot pay and the municipality auctions the animals.” Kouga municipal manager Charl du Plessis said most of the land is under private ownership. “We own some land in Humansdorp. We are in the middle of a land audit to find land that is not under use.”
