THE HAWKS have
arrested the mastermind behind the attempt to steal R100 million from the Royal
Bafokeng Trust. According to the Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke, the suspect was behind
the R100 million alleged fraud attempt from the Royal Bafokeng Trust account.  Maluleke said the suspect was arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime
Investigation Unit in Alexandra, near Johannesburg. He said the three other accused, Goci Nwabisa (29), Tshepo Daniel Sehlapelo
(27), and Aaron Madanda (40), were previously arrested on the spot when they
allegedly approached a consultant at a bank and requested her to assist them to
open a fraudulent account where the R100 million was to be transferred. The trio has since appeared at the Praktiseer District Court on different dates
and Nwabisa was granted R3000 bail whilst Sehlapelo and Madanda were remanded
in custody until 4 October 2018. Maluleke said meanwhile, the mastermind has been remanded in custody until 3
September 2018 for a formal bail application. He said the possibility of more arrests cannot be ruled out.
