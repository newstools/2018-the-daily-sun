Four years ago, Ayeye, a Mzansi TV show about three upcoming creatives who share a loft in Maboneng Precinct and work at an advertising agency, kept viewers glued to their screens. Ever since then, many have been hoping the popular series would make its return to their screens for another season. And for a moment, fans thought their wishes would be granted when the cast members, among whom were Thapelao Mokoena, Sithembiso Khoza, Mpho “Popps” Modikoane, Warren Masemola, Jessica Nkosi and other members came together for a reunion with the pictures getting fans excited on social media. However, that bubble was swiftly burst by one of the producer of the show who set the record straight about the likelihood of another season of Ayeye. “When we wrapped AYEYE 4 years ago we all promised that we would have a braai to catch up and it never happened,” said Producer Kutlwano Ditsele, “Somehow 4 years later we finally found time and caught for a dinner for old time’s sake. “So great to see everyone at the Ayeye Reunion dinner. “PS there isn’t a season 2., It was just a catch up for old time’s sakes,” he said, much to the disappointment of many of the show’s fans. When we wrapped AYEYE 4 years ago we all promised that we would have a braai to catch up and it never happened. Some how 4 years later we finally found time and caught for a dinner for old times sakes. So great to see everyone at the Ayeye Reunion dinner. PS there isn’t a season 2. It was just a catch up for old times sakes. A post shared by  Kutlwano Ditsele (@tha_filmaka) on Aug 27, 2018 at 3:18am PDT
