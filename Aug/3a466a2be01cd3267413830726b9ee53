THE troubled Okumhlophe High School may soon be closed. The school in Umlazi, south of Durban, owes the municipality about R700 000 for water and lights and R219 000 for furniture. Last week the school was served with a court order to attach all the office furniture. On top of that, eThekwini Municipality also served it with a final warning to pay about R700 000 in arrears or the services will be disconnected. Daily Sun has seen both letters of demand. The list of furniture to be attached includes photocopiers, printers, chairs and CCTV cameras. The school has been without a principal since July last year when the principal resigned. Last month parents protested outside the school, demanding the appointment of a principal. SGB member Queen Mkhonde confirmed they had received letters of demand. She said they were confused and feared the school would be closed. Mkhonde said the furniture was bought in 2013 by the principal, who resigned last year. “We fear the school will be closed. How can the school function without basic services like water and electricity? This is a problem from the former principal and the former SGB. We were not here in 2013.” Mkhonde said they had told the education department several times that the school was battling without a principal. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said they were not aware the school was in such difficulties but said the district would attend to the matter soon. He said a principal would be appointed soon. Princess Nkabane, eThekwini municipal spokeswoman, said the municipality didn’t discuss customer’s details with the media.
