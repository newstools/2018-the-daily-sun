A forensic investigator has been appointed to probe
irregularities on the investments made by Limpopo municipalities into the Venda
Building Society (VBS) Mutual Bank. Limpopo Government spokesperson Phuti Seloba said the
appointment follows the Limpopo Executive Council order that the Provincial
Treasury must immediately commence with a forensic audit, in order to determine
whether the 10 Municipalities namely Polokwane, Makhuduthamaga, Elias
Motsoaledi, Makhado, Ephraim Mogale, Collins Chabane, Vhembe District, Greater
Giyani, Lepelle-Nkumpi and Fetakgomo Tubatse broke any legal provisions when
they invested funds with VBS. Seloba said the Executive Council will only act once the
investigation has been completed. "In its meeting, EXCO has indicated that in instance
where the laws and regulations be found to have been contravened, actions need
to be taken against the offending officials. The affected officials will have to account,” Seloba said. Limpopo Premier Stanley Mathabatha strongly stressed that
serious actions will be taken against those implicated once the forensic
investigation is completed. "We view media report by the Democratic Alliance that
the affected Mayors should be fired misleading. The DA’s action by opening charges of fraud, racketeering
and corruption are premature and reckless. Sentiments are tantamount to hinder the investigation
processes enforced by the Provincial Government,” Mathabatha said. He said DA’s opening of those charges are not in any way
helping in the process and their action is viewed as useless grandstanding. Seven municipalities still have their invested funds with
VBS Mutual Bank, namely Ephraim Mogale, Lepelle-Nkumpi, Fetakgomo Tubatse,
Makhado, Vhembe, Greater-Giyani and Collins Chabane.
