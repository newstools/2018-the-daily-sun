THE National Arts Council chairperson Hartley Ngoato was brutally attacked in Hartbeespoort Dam. Ngoato posted pictures of himself on his Facebook page, saying he was attacked by whites in Hartbeespoortdam for being black at the Oewer club. “The same place SABC Cartblanche interviewed me for the betterment of the dam. Now few months later, I am denied to enjoy the same dam by whites who are opposed to black guy to occupy a piece of land that belongs to government,” Ngoato said. The Ngoato family issued a statement saying: “The attack on Hartley comes at a time when racial tensions in Hartbeespoort are at a peak, following vehement opposition by the predominant white Afrikaner community to increased applications by black people seeking leases to conduct business on state land along the shores of the dam.” “It is known within the white community that Hartley Ngoato is one of the black local businesspeople currently scouting for available state land to expand his businesses,” the statement read. In the pictures shared by Ngoato on social media, it shows that he suffered injuries on his face and he has bruises on his face as well.
