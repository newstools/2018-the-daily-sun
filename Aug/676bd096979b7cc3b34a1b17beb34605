Music producer and DJ, Themba ‘Euphonik’ Nkosi has left many tongues wagging after a little rant on Twitter this week. The DJ, who is currently travelling and playing abroad in locations such as France, felt the need to share his thoughts on the local entertainment scene. In fact, this little rant of his goes as far back as last week when he sent out a few cryptic tweets. “When they don't understand or "get" why you're successful they start with the excuses. Excuses make us all feel better about ourselves,” he said. He then threw out the tweet that sparked a conversation that went on for days. “Generally the entertainment industry in SA is either finished or boring AF. We are now just drawing blood from a stone,” he said. While a lot of people agreed with him, many have lambasted him, calling him fake for feeling like he has made it now that he is touring overseas with Black Coffee.
