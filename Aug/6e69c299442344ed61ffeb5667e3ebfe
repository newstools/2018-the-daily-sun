“I am innocent, and the allegations against me have never been proven.” This is according to Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille. De Lille’s resignation as Executive Mayor of the City was announced by Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane in Cape Town, Western Cape on Sunday )5 August). In a statement released by De Lille, she said that she can now focus on the real reason why she accepted the mayoral seat. De Lille also said that she remains committed to investing whatever little time she has left to the transformation of the City. She also said that the fight between her and the DA could not continue forever. “Our country is facing some massive challenges. “The cost of living is on the increase daily; what our country needs now more than ever, is for its leaders to put their differences aside and work even harder to address these historical imbalances in our society,” she said. De Lille said that she will be spending the remainder of her term as mayor trying to find resolutions to the land invasions that have been taking place in Cape Town. She also denied media reports that she struck a deal with the DA. “I want to assure South Africans that I did not make a deal with the DA,” she said. “I took the personal decision to resign because I could no longer take the consistent abuse.”
