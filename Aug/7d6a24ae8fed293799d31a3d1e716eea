Steinhoff International has been fined R1 million for keeping the market in the dark. The global retailer also received a public censure from the JSE on Tuesday for failing twice to pass on news of credit ratings cuts to investors. "According to Steinhoff‚ it was informed by Moody’s of the publication of the rating downgrade on December 8 2017. Steinhoff failed to publish an announcement on Sens on December 8 2017 to inform stakeholders of Moody’s rating action in accordance with the aforementioned listings requirements‚" the JSE said in Tuesday’s statement.
