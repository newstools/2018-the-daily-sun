MUMS are usually spoiled with a surprise party when a new baby is on the way. And dads-to-be know that’s no place for men at all. But these guys are getting in on the action with a nappy braai! Bhutana Peter and Siyamthanda Vanqa hosted a surprise nappy braai for soon-to- be daddy Aviwe Filita (29) from Queenstown, Eastern Cape. “The child is mine as well. I see no reason why men shouldn’t have baby showers,” he said. “Men are present in the delivery room, cutting umbilical cords. “So it’s only natural that they should be involved in other aspects as well. “This will also show women we don’t want to be outsiders in our children’s lives. “Not only do I want men to have fun baby showers, I want dads to be able to take time off work and take their babies for immunisations. “Gone are the days of just giving your buddy a cigarette and a pat on the back when his wife is expecting. These days guys can go all out, too.” According to Aviwe, nappy braais are just like the baby showers that women host. The aim is also to celebrate the new life and give advice to the parent to be. The men also play games such as filling up baby bottles with juice or beer and see who can drink the fastest. And the nappy bag challenge to see who can pack the baby’s essentials in the shortest time.
