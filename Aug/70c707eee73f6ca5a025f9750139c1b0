WESTERN Cape Premier Helen Zille might replace Patricia de Lille as Cape Town mayor. This after De Lille struck a deal with the DA to resign at the end of October. Zille confirmed that a number of people approached her to replace De Lille. But she said she was currently focusing on her goals for her term as premier, which ends next year. “I have been approached, but my desire is to finish my term as premier. “We have a term plan and some game changers where we have to reach critical milestones. “That isn’t over yet, so I’m working very hard on those.” Zille said the possibility of her replacing De Lille shouldn’t be ruled out. On Sunday, De Lille announced she was going to resign. This was after a long legal battle and several votes of no confidence instituted by the DA. She admitted the fight with the DA had to come to an end. “You can’t fight forever. Honestly, this has never been about me. “I’ve refused positions elsewhere and now I am walking away from the position of mayor,” said De Lille. The DA is expected to meet today to decide on a replacement.
