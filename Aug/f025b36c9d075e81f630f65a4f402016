AN INVESTIGATION has been launched by the Gauteng Health Department to determine how seven children contracted a bacterial infection in a babies ward. This was after two of the seven babies lost their lives due to the antibiotic-resistant klebsiella at Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. This information was given to DA shadow MEC Jack Bloom and the DA MPL Neil Campbell during their oversight inspection on Wednesday to investigate the babies’ deaths. “Hospital CEO Nomonde Mqhayi-Mbambo told us that the first case was identified on 9 July and one of the babies died that month. “Another died this month,” said Bloom. Bloom added that the remaining five babies have been isolated and are being treated. “The neonatal ward has been scrubbed down and strict infection control measures enforced to prevent further infections. They have unfortunately not yet identified the source,” said Bloom. Bloom explained that he was concerned that severe overcrowding and staff shortages had contributed to the deaths of the babies. “There is much unhappiness among the staff at this hospital. They presented a memorandum of grievances to hospital management in a peaceful picket on Tuesday,” he said.
