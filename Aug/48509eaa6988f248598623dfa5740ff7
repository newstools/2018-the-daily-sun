Instagram model and video vixen, Nicole Nyaba has threatened to release the nudes of a certain “queen” and her best friends. The controversial online sensation had social media in a frenzy last night after she made the threats on her InstaStory. According to Nicole, she is in possession of videos which show this unnamed “queen b” and her “squad of skanks” is various forms of undress. She made the explosive allegations in a series of posts on her InstaStory, the first of which was a simple caption that read “I got your nudes” with a bee emoji next to it. She then went on to post another video of herself singing a song that had some pretty shady lyrics. ”Imma throw shade if I can't get paid,” she sang. At the end of that video she says “Yo, I got your nudes, you wanna speak about me”. She also ran a poll asking her followers if they wanna see the queen’s nudes. “Yall want to see your queen’s nudes? Oh and her bestie vid?” she asked. But the post that had a lot of people questioning her mental state was the third and final post. “I’m preparing Bryanston rat meat from my ex’s crib for his queen b and squad of skanks. They coming over for dinner so I have a 3 point presentation of their nudes set aside for entertainment. Oh, honey for dessert,” she rambled on.
