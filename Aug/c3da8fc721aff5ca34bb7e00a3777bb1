Kaizer Chiefs forward Khama Billiat was happy with his performance against SuperSport United, but feels Amakhosi need to put in more effort to finish the job. The Zimbabwean bagged a goal and an assist in the MTN8 semi-final first leg tie which ended 2-2 at the Lucas Moripe Stadium. Billiat, who joined Chiefs on a free transfer from Mamelodi Sundowns, stated that his side played better football in the second half of the match. He also praised his understanding with Leonardo Castro after combining to score the second goal that salvaged the draw for the Glamour Boys. "Firstly, I want to thank God with yet another opportunity. It's always great to be out here getting this opportunity of playing football, which is what we always want to do," Billiat told SuperSport. "I think better second-half, we reacted accordingly and applied what the coach wanted us to do passing the balls in between and finding each other. "Brilliant goal from Castro, it's always something that we work on. Hopefully we will work more on the combinations, score goals and win games. "But great performance from the guys, we really worked hard and it's just a good feeling. More effort needs to be put on in the second leg. "When the result is like this, we feel more pressure and we cannot let it go anymore. We have to give our best. Score goals and try not to concede." The return leg will be played on Saturday, August 27 at the FNB Stadium. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
