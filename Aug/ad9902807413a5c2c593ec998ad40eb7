A
police officer was arrested for attempting to smuggle dagga into the
Polokwane Correctional Centre. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the 47-year-old police officer
came to fetch inmates who were due to appear in court. He
said then a correctional official on duty caught him attempting to smuggle
dagga for an inmate in the centre.  “Two packages of dagga weighing 143.99g, were confiscated from the member,”
Mojapelo said. The Provincial Commissioner Lt General Nneke Ledwaba condemned the conduct of the
cops in the strongest possible terms. "Police members are always expected to remain true to their conscience
and mandate, and refrain from engaging in criminal activities as the public at
large is looking up to them to be in the forefront in crime fighting,” said 
Ledwaba. The suspect, who is attached to Mankweng police station as a Court Orderly,
will appear in Polokwane magistrate court on Wednesday.
