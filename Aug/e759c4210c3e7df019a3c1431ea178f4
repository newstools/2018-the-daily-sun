THE ANC in Sedibeng said it had noted with concern reports that interns at Emfuleni Municipality were poking the party’s senior deployed cadres for jobs and big salaries. This after Daily Sun last week reported that a number of interns got their contracts renewed following allegations that they were having steamy office affairs with the ANC’s top men at the municipality. Fingers are apparently being pointed specifically at a senior member of the Mayoral Committee of Finance and a manager at the revenue services department. The story was published after a whistle-blower opened the can of worms online late last week in a post on Facebook. The officials had allegedly paid interns exorbitant salaries from an emergency fund. The ANC said it noted the seriousness of the matter and wished the municipality to investigate. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the ANC’s regional spokesman, Boniface Mazilazila said job opportunities and training meant for unemployed young people should be conducted in accordance with the approved legal prescripts rather than favours. Mazilazila said the ANC would seek guidance from the Regional Integrity Commission on the matter following investigations by the municipality to determine any possible breach of the ANC Constitution and ethical conduct expected from its members. “With the same pace of urgency, the ANC will be meeting with the Emfuleni Municipality political leadership to seek recourse,” he said.
