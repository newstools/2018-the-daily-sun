THEY live in fear that the tremors from the mine could cost them their lives. Residents of Endlovini in Mangweni, Limpopo told Daily Sun whenever they hear a blast from the Nkomati Anthracite mine, they fear their homes will collapse or they will be swallowed by holes in the ground. “Since we started living here several years ago, we have had the same problem,” said Elsie Lusibane. “But when we raise this issue with the mine we are told there’s no proof our houses cracked from the blast vibrations.” She said she struggles to patch the cracks in her house. “I’ve given up trying to live in peace,” she said. Resident Antony Khoza said he and his family abandoned their house as it was becoming too risky. “The windows were damaged and there were cracks all over the house. “We decided to leave. “The mine needs to do something about this and fix the problem once and for all.” Given Thwala said the mine doesn’t take them seriously. “We have gone there many times to talk to them but our efforts are fruitless.” He said they don’t benefit from the mine and the area was full of jobless people. “People who work at the mine don’t have our problems. “It hurts us to see them going to work,” he said. “The mine should make a plan to move us. We are tired of sleeping with one eye open.” Alan Herbert, the mine’s CEO, told Daily Sun they had a meeting with the community representatives on Thursday and agreed that a survey would be conducted with all affected households.
