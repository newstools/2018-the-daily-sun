WHEN elections draw closer, politicians arrive in their kasi with food parcels and free ANC T-shirts. Every time the residents fell for the electioneering. But yesterday the residents of Ramaphosa squatter camp in Ekurhuleni said “No More!” and took to the streets. The angry people said they were tired of being bribed with T-shirts while being left dicing with death. They pointed at the izinyoka wires spreading all over the ground in the squatter camp. Some of the live power lines even snaked through puddles of stagnant water, creating an instant death trap. They demanded that the municipality provide them with proper electricity. The protesters blocked the main road leading to Elsburg, in the process stoning cars and burning a truck. Luckily, the driver managed to escaped unharmed. Community leader Ntsimbi Bovane said not having street lights made their kasi an ideal hunting ground for criminals. “We don’t like to steal electricity but our circumstances force us,” said Jabu Nkoana. Cops used rubber bullets and pepper spray to disperse the angry residents who were seen throwing stones at the police nyala. The protesters vowed not to stop until the mayor came to address them. Meanwhile, the residents of nearby Reiger Park were not impressed, as the blocked main road was their only means of getting to Elsburg. “We are also concerned about their lack of services but they are make us suffer by closing the road,” said a Reiger Park resident. Constable Jan Mokwana of Reiger Park police said no arrest were made. He confirmed that a truck was torched and private and police vehicles stoned.
