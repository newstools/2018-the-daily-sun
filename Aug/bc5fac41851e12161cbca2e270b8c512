The king of kicks, Dr. Malinga never seizes to amaze us with his on stage antics. Whether itâ€™s his hilarious facial expressions, his high kicks or his sheer energy, Malinga can sure captivate an audience. We thought we had seen it all from the Angilalanga Izolo hit-maker, but it seems like we were wrong. Yesterday, Malinga had fans shook with a video taken from his latest performance. In the video, Malinga and a fan are seen dry humping each other on stage in front of the audience. Since he posted the video, people have been on a mission to give this so-called dance a name. Watch it below: STRENGTH OF A WOMAN. A post shared by  Dr Malinga (@drmalinga) on Aug 21, 2018 at 10:04am PDT
