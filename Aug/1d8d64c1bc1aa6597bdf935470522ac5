THE Eastern Cape Liquor Board warned pupils against boozing at an event held in Tsolo Junction Community Hall on Wednesday. The event was held to create awareness about underage drinking. High school pupils from Thandanani, Rueben Ntuli, KT Mchasa, Dilizintaba, Lutuka, Gcisa and Jongilizwe prepared plays and speeches to warn fellow pupils about underage drinking. Pumlani Fani, a communications officer at the liquor board, said they received many requests from people in the area, asking them to tackle underage drinking. “We were told that there were many incidents where pupils missed school and were found boozing at taverns during school hours. “Underage drinking is high in the area. With the drama and public speaking competition, we aim to teach young people that booze is not for pupils.” Captain Seriana Remonate told pupils that they were dealing with many rape cases involving girls who were attacked after getting drunk. “Many young girls fall victim to sexual assaults because they booze. “This is not to say boys should be drinking because some criminal cases involving young men are committed while under the influence of alcohol. “We are appealing to you to stay away from booze because it will ruin your future,” she said. Education specialist Lineo Nzeleni told pupils: “You can celebrate without drinking alcohol. Booze is not for pupils and it will ruin your future.” Teacher Silvia Mdoda from Jongilizwe said access to alcohol was very easy for young people as the taverns don’t ask for IDs. “The age restriction does not really apply in our village.” Pupils who took part in the competition won things such as medals, soccer balls and vouchers. The prizes were sponsored by Shoprite in the area.
