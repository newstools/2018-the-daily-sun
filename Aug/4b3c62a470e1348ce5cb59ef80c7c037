TV personality and choreographer, Somizi Mhlongo spent the day with his current and former bae over the weekend. The V-Entertainment presenter was out for lunch with his current fiancé, Mohale Motaung together with his former girlfriend and baby mamma, Palesa Madisakwane. Somizi and Mohale were in matching outfits and spent the day at the spa and then went out for drinks. Palesa joined in on the fun and it seems like everyone got along. Somizi shared the pictures on social media, calling everyone his “perfect family”. Palesa also couldn’t help but gush over Somizi and Mohale on her Instagram page. Somizi and Palesa have a 23-year-old daughter, Bahumi. They were in a relationship before Bahumi’s conception, when Somizi supposedly thought he was bisexual. SomGaga was in a relationship with a man when he met Palesa and she expressed interest in him. He later realized that he was gay and ended things with her.
