RESIDENTS told Daily Sun they have been quiet for a long time, but said they can’t afford to pay for electricity and water that informal settlers are stealing from them any longer. “We can’t suffer in our permanent houses,” said a resident in the RDP section of Mamelodi East, Tshwane. Residents said their municipal bills are very high because of the squatters. Resident Elias Moshidi (52) said: “For the past two years we have been suffering without water and electricity.” He said it hurts to open dry taps and use candles, paraffin and firewood while illegal residents enjoy all the basic necessities. “We’ll not fold our arms and keep quiet while people are stealing from us,” he said. According to Elias, the people from the informal settlements of Kanana and Mountain View have been stealing from them since 2016, and are violent if confronted. Residents said last year the squatters almost killed a resident and they are scared to approach them. They said sometimes they go for weeks without water because of the squatters. And they have been living without electricity for three months because people from the informal settlements cut and stole their electrical cables. Jonas Mlamuli (29) said in January a transformer exploded and almost destroyed two local houses. “Our leaders only come here before elections because they need our votes,” he said. Residents said electrical surges also have burnt their electrical appliances. Darryl Moss, Tshwane MMC for infrastructure, said the city is planning a number of actions to solve the problem.
