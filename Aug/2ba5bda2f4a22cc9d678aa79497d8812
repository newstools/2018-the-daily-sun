BAROKA FC are aiming to rectify their mistakes and improve when they host Cape Town City FC in an Absa Premiership match at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday night (7.30pm). Bakgaga are coming to this clash following a disappointing 1-0 defeat to Cavin Johnson’s AmaZulu in their 2018-19 season opener at King Zwelethini Stadium at the weekend. But Baroka captain Letladi Madubanya has promised their fans that they will get their performance right against Benni McCarthy’s side. The Citizens are full of confidence following an impressive start to the season where they beat SuperSport United 2-0 at the weekend. “We had a chat with the boys after we lost to AmaZulu and they want to fix their mistakes and ensure we don’t repeat them,” said the 34-year-old defender. “We are playing at home and we can’t afford to drop points again. This is our first home game of the season. We have to win in front of our fans. “Cape Town are a good side with a good coach and we respect them. But we have to get a win tomorrow night. We just can’t lose two matches in a row at this stage.” Indeed, another defeat for Baroka could put unnecessary pressure on the team and their new coach, Wedson Nyirenda. The former Zambian national coach joined Baroka this season and the club management is hoping he are the right man to help the team avoid fighting relegation this season.
