FOLLOWING salary grievances that saw players refuse to continue pre-season preparation, Jomo Cosmos owner-coach Jomo Sono has decided to overhaul his team and start afresh. A salary dispute led to a strike by senior players, who also sought help in the matter from the South African Football Players Union. However, Sono told SunSport yesterday that his decision to make wholesale changes had nothing to do with players not getting paid. After failing to win promotion via the play-offs in June, Cosmos lost close to 10 players who were signed by Absa Premiership clubs. Now Sono has confirmed that more players will be given their clearances this week to make way for new signings set to be unveiled in Joburg today. “I have to rebuild this team,” said Sono. “We are not releasing the players because of the current problems, their contracts with us have lapsed and won’t be renewed. Now we will rebuild this team with young blood who are hungrier.” Sono went on to reveal that they did not plan on challenging for the National First Division title this season. They start their campaign when they host Ajax Cape Town at Tembisa’s Makhulong Stadium on Saturday (3pm). “We’re approaching the new season with a positive attitude,” he said. “We plan to win our games but we’re not looking at gaining automatic promotion because we want to lay a strong foundation for next season. “We will have a new team so it might be difficult for the new players to emulate last season’s performance.” Although Sono refused to divulged the names of players who will make way for new recruits, SunSport has reliably learnt that Clifford Mulenga, who still has two years remaining on his contract, will be one of the players released. Goalkeeper King Ndlovu, who was allegedly training with Bidvest Wits, has since returned to Ezenkosi but is also among players to be kicked out. Cosmos’ new signings set to be unveiled today include Zane Mahlangu, Thulani, Khwinana, Mwenya Chibwe and Grigori Grishin.
