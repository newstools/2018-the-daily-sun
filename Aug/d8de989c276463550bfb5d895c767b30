MEN – especially politicians, priests and traditional leaders – should practise what they preach and put a stop to the abuse of women and children. This was a call by deputy president David Mabuza on Saturday at the Interfaith National Prayer Service at Ellis Park, Joburg. “Our liberation struggle was not just about ending national oppression. “It was also about ending the triple oppression of women. Black women were oppressed on the basis of race, class and gender.” Mabuza slammed the senseless and cowardly killing of women, labelling it barbaric. He said it had no place in our civilization. “Patriarchy remains omnipresent in our language, idioms, metaphors, stories, myths and performances,” he said. “As a society steeped in violence, we are called upon to admit that we are a broken society that needs to rediscover those values that have for years united us as people to stand firm against injustice and prejudice.” He was speaking to a gathering that included leaders from various religions, government and civil rights groups. Mabuza called on churches and the religious fraternity to join government in ending hopelessness, joblessness and poverty. “All these ills are carried mostly by women, by mothers and grandmothers in the absence of sustained fatherhood,” Mabuza said. He added that while government respected the duties of churches to pray and guide, it was the state’s duty to arrest, prosecute and send criminals to jail.
