A shipment of snacks being
transported in a trailer turned out to be a stolen Ford Ranger. The shocking discovery was
made on the N1 highway en route Zimbabwe.  Four suspects
who were travelling in the bakkie were arrested in the early hours of Wednesday
morning.  Police
spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the police were busy with their
routine duties along the N1 road, south of Polokwane, when they stopped a
Toyota Hilux towing a trailer. “As the police were busy
searching the vehicle and its trailer, a grey Ford Ranger was found loaded on
the trailer,” Mojapelo said.  They will
appear in Polokwane magistrate court soon on a charge of possession of
suspected stolen motor vehicle.
