AFTER being dumped by her previous manager, Babes Wodumo has found herself a new manager. Babes will now be managed by her sister, Nondumiso Simelane. She made a grand entrance at Ensimbini Lifestyle in Folweni, KZN, where she performed for her fans. She was supposed to perform on Saturday night, but only arrived in the early hours of Sunday morning. Nondumiso told the crowd she was Babes’ manager and apologised that she had arrived late for the show. “We are extremely excited to be here. “Performing for the music fans at Ensimbini is very important to us. “We are particularly excited about the warm reception. This shows love,” said Nondumiso. At the weekend, Sunday Sun reported that Hlengiwe Mbambo had dumped Babes Wodumo. Sources said this was after she clashed with Nondumiso. Before Babes went on stage, she took a few selfies with the crowd. She performed all her popular songs, including Jiva Phezu Kombhede, Umngani Wami and Gandaganda. “I want to tell my fans that I love you so much. Thank you for being here and spending time with me. “Now I want to see your drinks in the air,” Babes told the crowd. She was accompanied by Madanon, who warmed up the crowd earlier on. Fan Sipho Nkala said: “It was the first time I’ve been here and I don’t regret it. “I’m happy that Babes even took selfies with us.” Event organiser Mlungisi Makhanya said: “This is only the beginning of good things to come. “It’s not the first time that we have hosted Babes and people love her. “This place is home to big names.”
