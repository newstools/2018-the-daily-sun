GAUTENG Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa visited Kalafong Hospital’s new mother and baby unit on Sunday. Her visit to the hospital in Atteridgeville, Tshwane was part of her department’s ongoing attempt to improve mother and baby care at public hospitals. The MEC said Gauteng had the most units for mums and their new babies. Ramokgopa admitted there were problems with overcrowding at the hospital and said she would look into the matter. Nurses told Ramokgopa a high number of foreigners used the hospital’s services. “Foreigners flock to Kalafong Hospital because they believe it offers the best service. “We give health care to everyone who needs it,” said the MEC. She promised her department would look into ways to help the hospital deal with overcrowding.
