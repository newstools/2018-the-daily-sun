COPS were awarded on Wednesday for all the hard work they put into protecting the public. The KwaMashu cop shop, north of Durban, handed over medals to thank staff for their dedication. Nine officers were given awards  for 30 and for 20 years of service. There was also a Centenary Award and awards for members who worked during the 2010 Soccer World Cup. Captain Bhekizizwe Mbiko (54), originally from Mzimkhulu, was awarded for 30 years of service. He told Daily Sun he started working for the police in 1985 in Soweto. “I got transferred back home to KZN in 2001 and was stationed in Mnambithi,” he said. “In 2015, I arrived at the KwaMashu Police Station. “Policing is not an easy job but I love my work and I’m able to do it well.” He said in order to be a good cop, a person must have a lot of discipline and respect for others. “I respect my work and the people I protect,” he said. Mbiko said he was a family man and married with five kids “My family is very supportive and they understand my work,” he said. “They’re used to me not being at home in the evenings.” Mbiko said this was the first medal he had received since he started working for the police service. Speaking at the ceremony, station commander Brigadier Zakhele Nzama said: “In all our daily efforts, our ultimate goal is to create a better South Africa for all who live in it.” Nzama congratulated all the cops who received awards.
