unemployed graduates in Durban embarked on a march on Wednesday. They demanded that government offer longer internships. They said two years was not enough as possible employers were looking for people with atleast three years experience. They marched from the corner of Botha Street and headed to the City Hall, with some of them wearing their graduation gowns. They held up placards which read: “Government. stop playing with us!” and “We want jobs!” Mangosutho University graduate Nkululeko Ndlovu (29) said they wanted the jobs the government promised when it was campaigning for the election. “We spend years in school hoping for a better future as we were promised. But when we complete our qualifications, we don’t find jobs as they require three or more years experience,” he said. Durban University of Technology graduate Wiseman Ngubane (32) said he got a one-year internship from the department of arts and culture in 2016 but that didn’t help him as he was still jobless. The graduates handed over their memorandum to the City Hall. Mlungisi Ntombela from mayor Zandile Gumede’s office accepted it on her behalf. “We’re going to take your memorandum but as a municipality, there’s not much we can do. We’ll try to engage with the private sector about your demands.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the march. He said the crowd dispersed peacefully.
