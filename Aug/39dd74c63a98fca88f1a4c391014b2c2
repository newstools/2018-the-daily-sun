MANY people are well informed about blood donation and its importance. But fewer people know about organ donation. August is Organ Donor Month and is the perfect time to sign up to become an organ donor. Cleo Ndhlovu, manager of Tshwane University of Technology’s Centre for Tissue Engineering, is urging SunReaders to donate their organs to save lives. Speaking in Tshwane last week, Ndhlovu said they were running out of skin to treat burn victims. She said they currently only had a two-day supply. “Due to the number of fires, especially in informal settlements, there is a huge shortage of skin to treat burn victims,” she said. “We appeal to the public to consider organ donation after they die.” Ndhlovu said donors are not paid for their donations. Jooste Vermeulen, communications director for the Organ Donor Foundation, said organ and tissue donors give sick people hope for the future. “By registering to become an organ and tissue donor, you could give a living parent another chance to look after their children. “You can also give a future to a child and added years with family to a sister or brother,” he said. Vermeulen said despite many cultural and religious differences, the foundation believes that with the right education and information, they could come together to understand the issues surrounding the subject of organ and tissue donation.
