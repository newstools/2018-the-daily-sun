ALL the parents wanted was a brighter future for their kids. They chose a small, affordable private school where kids would get individual attention. Little did they know Gazelle Academy wasn’t registered and the teachers were not qualified. And that’s not all. The owner is also the principal, while the teachers are her husband, son, daughter-in-law and her friend. Daily Sun visited the school on Monday afternoon. One angry parent, Motshabi Motsumi, said: “I noticed my kids’ books were not marked. “I came here to enquire and found kids cleaning the floor and washing the dishes. “One teacher told me kids weren’t taught, and that the school is registered as a private company. “It’s a family business. The department of education confirmed this to me.” She called the cops and education officials after questioning the owner. She claimed she was promised money to tell other parents she was given false information about the school. Principal Belinda van der Merwe said their application for accreditation was pending. “She said the building had been registered as a school site,” she said. “The teachers are students because I can’t afford permanent qualified educators. “The school was formed in 2015 by my brother, but he died. “It was called Nonyane Primary School and was waiting to be registered. We registered Gazelle as a private business. North West Education spokesman Freddy Sepeng said: “We will urgently send officials to close down the school because it’s illegal.”
