The South African Football Association (SAFA) CEO, Dennis Mumble, has confirmed that the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) can't afford to broadcast any Bafana Bafana and Banyana Banyana games. According to the TimesLIVE, negotiations between the two organisations failed as the SABC owes SAFA over R50 million from the previous deal which ended in April 2018.“They (the SABC) have just been refusing to enter into an agreement with us because they say they do not have any money‚” Mumble said.“So, what they want to do is substantially reduce the fee that we charge them, or they paid during the last contract.“We have been negotiating since January of this year and we have not got anywhere because there is no appetite for football on the SABC. That is my impression.”The news comes after the SABC confirmed on Friday (August 3) that they would not broadcast any Absa Premiership fixtures on radio this season.It has been reported that about 10 million listeners tune in on match-days to hear the commentary on the games.The public broadcaster said the matches would, however, still be aired on its television stations as the season started on Saturday, August 4.Mumble further questioned the SABC's commitment to broadcast national games when Bafana Bafana and Banyana Banyana play.“You would probably have to ask them (SABC) exactly how important is the national team to the public broadcaster‚” Mumble continued.“In the last two discussions we have had with them‚ and this is with the top leadership of the SABC‚ the position was ‘we do not have money and we want to be a responsible broadcaster and therefore we cannot spend money. Can you please help us convince government to give us money?’“We are negotiating with a partner who has not commercialised the property that we gave them‚ given that Bafana Bafana is the single most important and valuable sports property in this country by far... but we are not being paid.“The ratings have shown historically what Bafana have been able to present. (But) to them (SABC) Bafana is simply not valuable property to broadcast and therefore it needs public money in order to support the national team. So, go figure that one.” SOURCE: SPORT24
