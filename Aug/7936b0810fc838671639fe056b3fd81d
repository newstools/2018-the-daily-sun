AT MOST schools there are no twins, at some schools there are some. . .  and at Nqobani Primary School in KZN there are 21 sets of twins and one set of triplets. Perhaps it has got something to do with the water in the Black Umfolozi River which flows nearby, but twins are found from grade R up to grade 7. On Friday the school held a celebration for the twins. Principal Nkosinathi Zondi told Daily Sun he asked teachers to count the twins. “It took them a week to finish counting!” said Zondi. “There are twins in every grade, so we thought it called for a celebration. I feel blessed.” A grade three teacher, Zonke Jali, said in her classroom she has triplets – Siyamthanda, Simphiwe and Sineliso (9) Madlala. “Two boys and a girl. They always play together. I think they enjoy each other’s company,” said Jali. The triplets’ mum, Nomthandazo (43), said she did not have problems taking care of the triplets. “When they started school the teachers separated them. It was very hard for the one who was alone. He even struggled with his schoolwork until I went to the school and asked the teachers to put them together in one class. Then he was okay,” she said. She said the girl was naughtier than the boys. A mother of twins, Nomfundo Hlongwane (31), said some people had a problem identifying her twins, Anele and Ayanda (12). “But I can tell them apart by their legs. “Ayanda is thin, while Anele is a little bit bigger,” said Nomfundo.
