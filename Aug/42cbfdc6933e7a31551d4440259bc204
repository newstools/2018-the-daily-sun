THE death of young boys and girls at initiation schools has forced government to act. Public hearings into the Customary Initiation Bill started in Port Elizabeth on Monday. About 100 people gathered at Nangoza Jebe Community Hall in New Brighton to air their views and concerns. Over the next three weeks, the portfolio committee on co-operative governance and traditional affairs will travel to provinces before presenting its findings to parliament. Committee chairman Richard Mdakane told chiefs, traditional surgeons and others that government wanted to getrid of fake circumcision schools. “We need the input of all provinces. We’re not here to impose the bill,” said Mdakane. “We’re here to get your views. Laws are made by you.” Traditional surgeon Fikile Tsibani (47) from Motherwell said Western doctors shouldn’t be allowed at initiation schools. Another surgeon, Luxolo Dingeta (38), said the new law shouldn’t limit the time initiates were allowed to stay in the bush as healing times differed. “We need to keep them there until they’re fit to go back home. We also need to be supplied with uniforms and name tags to identify fake surgeons,” he said. Mzi Komani (20) said he had spent three weeks in hospital in 2014 after a fake traditional doctor kidnapped him. “The new law should be tough on illegal and unregistered initiation schools and traditional surgeons,” he said. “They should be held responsible for injuries and deaths of initiates under their care.” Simphiwe Klaas of Uitenhage said government should supply land for initiation rituals to take place. “We don’t have land on which to practise safely because all the land in the metro is either owned by farmers or has been invaded by squatters,” he said.
