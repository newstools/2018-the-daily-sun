A LIMPOPO school troubled by a high rate of pregnancy received a special visit from soccer legends to motivate the pupils. This came after reports emerged last month that 27 pupils from Molautsi Secondary School in Mmotong wa Perikisi outside Polokwane, Limpopo were pregnant and the management of the school was heavily criticised. Former Kaizer Chiefs striker Jabu Mahlangu, who is currently a sports analyst, did not mince his words. Mahlangu told the school management and parents that the kids’ dress code could be the cause. “Let us look at the pupils’ dress code. We have to be strict on that. A girl pupil cannot be allowed to go to school in a short skirt. “I am from KZN and schools there are more strict with the dress code. It is also tempting to the teachers when pupils wear short skirts,” he said. Mahlangu visited the school along with former Orlando Pirates defenders Lucky Lekgwathi and Toni Chabalala. MTN sponsored the visit. MTN also donated sportswear, bicycles and tablets to the school. Mahlangu urged all stakeholders, including parents and the Education Department, to take the dress code issue into consideration to reduce high pregnancy rates at schools. “I am a parent to three children, two girls and a boy. I look after them and check if they are dressed accordingly,” he said. He told the troubled school’s pupils to focus on school and learn from Caster Semenya’s example. Limpopo MEC for Education Ishmael Kgetjepe also encouraged parents to participate in the issues the school was facing. Local councillor Evans Mothapo called for a meeting with all stakeholders to find a solution for teenage pregnancies in schools across the province. “When we work together, we can achieve more and give our children a better life,” he said.
