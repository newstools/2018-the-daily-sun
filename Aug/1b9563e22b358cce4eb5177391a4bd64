DESPITE the overall decline in job vacancies, open posts rates in the Eastern Cape and North West remain the highest, at 22% and 19%, respectively. The Free State has seen a decrease, from 11,8% to 6,9%. This was announced by Michael Seloane, commissioner of the Public Service Commission, in Tshwane yesterday. Seloane said it was important for provinces with vacancy rates exceeding 10% to ensure important posts were filled. Departments with the highest vacancy rates were sport and recreation, at 39,1%, transport 28,1% and rural development and land reform, at 24,8%. “The department of social development has a vacancy rate of 22,4%. Rural development and land reform had 650 vacancies at the beginning of the first quarter, and an additional 998 at the end of the same quarter.” He said although the department of public works had the highest vacancy rate, at 40,4% in the fourth quarter, they had filled a large number of posts. But a complaints of irregularities in those appointments were lodged and they’re investigating. “Public service had 8 684 appointments for the 2018/19 first quarter and a total of 7 277 terminations. “The reasons for terminations vary among departments and provinces, but the most prominent type was resignation and retirement,” he said. Most posts in the public service were filled through transfers, instead of new appointments.
