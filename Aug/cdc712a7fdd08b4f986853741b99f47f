DESPITE getting disqualified for taking a wrong turn in the Spar Women’s 10km Challenge in Pietermaritzburg on Sunday, Glenrose Xaba (Boxer) has retained her grip on the Grand Prix title, with just one race to go. Xaba, title-holder Kesa Molotsane and two Lesotho runners were disqualified on Sunday after they followed the wrong vehicle and went the wrong way during the race, which was won by Nedbank runner Irvette van Zyl. Xaba, who earned valuable bonus points when she won the Pretoria race earlier this month, has 87 points – five more than her nearest rival, Zimbabwean Rudo Mhonderwa, who has 82. Fellow Zimbabwean and Nedbank teammate Rutendo Nyahora, who came third in Pietermaritzburg, leapfrogged Molotsane to move into third place on the Grand Prix ladder with 78 points. Molotsane was probably the biggest loser from Sunday’s drama as she is now 14 points behind Xaba, but she was looking strong on the day and seemed ready to move into the lead when she and the other three took the wrong turn. She has dropped to fourth with 73 points. Van Zyl, who missed two races because of her pregnancy, has come back with a vengeance since giving birth to her second son, Gideon. Two months to the day after giving birth she came fourth in Pretoria and two weeks later she won in Pietermaritzburg. She has jumped 10 places on the Grand Prix ladder, going from 15th place to fifth, with a total of 55 points. Sunday’s confusion gave Nedbank the advantage in the team competition, which they now lead by 416 points to 332 for KPMG and Boxer, who are joint second. The final leg of the series will take place at Mark Park in Emmarentia, Joburg, on Sunday 7 October.
