MANDLA Mandela wants to restore his late gogo’s rundown house to its former dignified state. Mandla, the eldest grandson of late former president Nelson Mandela and his first wife, Evelyn Mase, said he would be glad once the house in the main street of Cofimvaba, Eastern Cape is restored. The house belonged to Mase, who together with Madiba had four children, including Mandla’s father, Makgatho. Mase, a nurse by profession, was married to Madiba from 1944 to 1958. Despite its rich history, the house was deserted as no one lived in it. “The home is very important to us because we have some fond memories there. That’s the reason we want to restore it and keep it for family use,” said Mandla. He said there were no plans to turn it into a heritage site. Although Mandla said no one stayed at the house, City Press saw a man running out of it. Some people in the area said they feared the house was a hideout for thugs. – CITY PRESS
