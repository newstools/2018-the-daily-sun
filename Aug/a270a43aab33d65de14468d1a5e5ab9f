Rapper and winner of the first season of Vuzu’s The Hustle, BigStar Johnson has finally released his debut offering, Me & Mines. This comes after news broke last month that the 26-year-old rapper from Kempton Park, Joburg had signed a deal with Warner Music SA under which he would be releasing his debut album. The album speaks on issues such as growing up, friendships, family, fatherhood and the “good old days”. It begins with a prelude which introduces listeners to the next chapter of the rapper’s life. Aptly titled Understand Part II and featuring Kaylo, BigStar talks about his formative years and how his fame came about. He also speaks about the value of music, God and family in keeping him grounded. The album continues on to the dance-hall beat of Special Assignment, a love letter to the girl of his dreams. The story continues on throughout the 12-track album in which we hear BigStar shows off his musical range. Me & Mines features collaborations with some of the country’s big-name-rappers like Rouge on Two Cups, Jay Claude on Calling, Kwesta on Sgubu and Zoocci Coke Dope on Paradise. PROFILE: BIG STAR JOHNSON! Of course, the album features the familiar, already-released songs like Closer, Time of My Life (extended version) and Sgubu which pays homage to Kwaito and its pioneers like TKZee. “Me & Mines is about to bless the nation with some variety….can’t wait to see the people react to the type of music I love making,” said BigStar, real name Tumelo Rakumako. In its essence, the album is a sincere tribute to those who are most dear and near to Big Star’s heart. From the sonogram of his daughter on the cover to the voicenotes from fans that play out at the end of the track Me & Mines – it’s all about the people in the Tumelo’s life.
