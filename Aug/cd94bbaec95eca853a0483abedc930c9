THEY posed as the victim was capturing their photo to assure her that they were not thugs. But after they swindled her out of her wedding ring and gold earrings, she took the same photo to the police. The cops thanked the thugs for making their work easier as they didn’t even have to worry about drawing up identikits. The victim from Wright Park in Springs, Ekurhuleni, said the three men knocked on her door on Tuesday and introduced themselves jewellery cleaners. She fell for their trick and opened the door. The thugs went inside and opened the bag they were carrying to take out the chemicals to clean her wedding ring and gold earrings. The woman told the cops: “They assured me they were not thieves and even allowed me to take their photo. They poured the chemical on my ring and said the gold was not real but was copper.” The trio told her they would take her jewellery to their factory in Brakpan. “One of them left with my jewellery and the other two remained behind.” She said after some time the other two told her they would go and check why their colleague was taking so long and would return before 3pm. They never came back! “They fooled me because they looked genuine and were decently dressed. “There was nothing about them that made me suspicious.” Captain Johannes Ramphora said they were looking for the three thugs in the photo. He urged anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111 or contact Springs police on 011 365 5719/20 .
