MAMOTSE wanted to surprise her boyfriend at his place, but never got there. Mamotse Matseme (35) of Kwa-Thema, Ekurhuleni was raped and killed this weekend. Her body was found by a passer-by in open space between Vergenoeg and Rest in Peace in the kasi early on Saturday morning. Captain Thabo Sibuyi said the passer-by called residents and cops. “She must have been raped before she was stabbed and killed with a sharp instrument. There are no leads as to who the suspects might be, or the motive for the killing. “We are told she was last seen walking with a man, and we appeal to him for information.” Aunt Mamikie Huma said the killing is sad, days after women marched against abuse. “We wonder why she was killed. It looks like the attackers used objects to attack her, as her bones were broken and she was bruised all over. “We are hurt and call on government to take a strong stance on the killing of women and children.” A murder case was opened at the KwaThema cop shop. Anyone who might have information is asked to call 08600 10111.
