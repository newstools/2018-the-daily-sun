BLACK Leopards’ management are not happy with the way the club is being treated by the Premier Soccer League. The PSL newcomers claim that they have lost close to R1 million after their first Absa Premiership encounter with Polokwane City on Saturday was played at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane instead of their home venue, Thohoyandou Stadium. This saw Leopards lodge a protest before the start of the game. Despite the setback, Lidoda Duvha managed to beat Rise and Shine 1-0 thanks to Karabo Tshepe’s goal. “It is true, we have lodged a protest. We did all necessary work (upgrades) we were asked to do by the PSL. They sent their inspectors who were happy with the renovations we had done and gave Thohoyandou Stadium the thumbs-up. But still we had to play in Polokwane,” said Leopards manager Tshifhiwa Thidiela. “Leopards fans were looking forward to some PSL action and always come in numbers when we play at home.” Meanwhile, Leopards head coach Joel Masutha was pleased with his side’s performance on Saturday. “This was a great start to the season,” said Masutha. “We have dreamt of having this kind of start. The win will help to boost the confidence of players for the coming matches. They put up a good performance and although we could have scored more than one goal, I can’t complain. “Our aim was to get three points. We did not come here for a point, as it was our home game.” But the former Leopards goalkeeper, who guided the Venda side back into the top flight after they spent five seasons in the National First Division, also had a warning for his charges. He said: “The win means nothing – we still have 29 league games to play. The feeling victory brings is good, but we have not yet achieved our goal. “We must continue working hard and improve with each game. We are back in the PSL to stay – but to achieve that, we need to collect every available point in the early stages of the season.”
