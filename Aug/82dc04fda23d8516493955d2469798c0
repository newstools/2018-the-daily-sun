ROBELA Mabusela (43) is proud of his culture The poet from Ga-Mmalepetleke in Mosesetjane, outside Mokopane, said he was worried young people had lost their roots. In 2015 he decided to write Sepedi poems that taught the youth about their culture. The book, titled Dikeletso Re Di Tsea Bathong, was published last year. He said: “People used to invite me to recite my poems at weddings, parties, funerals and traditional ceremonies. “They encouraged me to write a book so my poems wouldn’t be forgotten when I die. “I wanted to remind people, especially the youth, where they come from. “My other goal was to urge people to embrace their culture.” One of the 43 poems in the book encourages young people to focus on their studies and refrain from abusing drugs and alcohol. “The poems also advise them to make sure they are headed in the right direction.” Robela is writing another book which will be published in December.
