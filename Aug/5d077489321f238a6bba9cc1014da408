THE hospital looks beautiful from the outside, but the mood is grim inside. Workers at the Steve Biko Academic Hospital, Tshwane, allegedly work under unbearable conditions. They have complained of a lack of proper protective gear. When they complained to management, they were allegedly told to swim in patients’ blood! The workers said they couldn’t take it anymore. They feared that they might catch diseases. “We’ve been working in unhealthy, hazardous conditions for three months,” claimed one of them. Theatre staff said they had to wash surgical instruments in a deep basin with short gloves. They said it’s been five years since the hospital promised to bring washing machines. They said their aprons were not up to standard. “All these things are dirty,” said a staff member. “We have 21 theatres and we clean sets of countless bowls every day without personal protective gear. “When there is an inspection, management makes sure personal protective gear is available, but it’s taken away after the inspection.” Steve Biko Academic Hospital spokeswoman Lovey Mogapi said: “There are a lot of long gloves. Staff members don’t prefer them. “The ones they prefer are not durable and are expensive. We can only buy a few at a time. “Management would never compromise staff safety because of a lack of money. “Therefore, we continue to supply as per staff preference, despite having more durable and ideal gloves.” She said there were plenty of aprons.
