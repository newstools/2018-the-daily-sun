Gauteng police are investigating a murder case after the burnt body of a man was found in Etwatwa, Daveyton, on Tuesday morning. Captain Kay Makhubele said a member of the public was walking past a grazing farm around 11:30 when they noticed the body in the bush. When officers arrived, they found a middle-aged man with both feet tied with wire. His identity was not yet known. Makhubele said they were investigating whether the crime was linked to a man being set alight about 10km away last week. News24 previously reported that residents of Daveyton, Benoni, had allegedly set a suspected gangster alight on Wednesday near the Unity Secondary School. He was rushed to hospital. Gauteng education department spokesperson Steve Mabona said at the time that residents had allegedly dragged the man to the school to point out a pupil who was alleged to be part of a local gang. "Upon not finding the [pupil], the gang member tried to escape but was accosted by the community in full view of [pupils]." The gang is suspected of committing horrendous crimes in Daveyton, including robbery and murder. SOURCE:Â NEWS24
