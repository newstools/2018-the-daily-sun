EVEN the ancestors use SunPower to do good! Kholeka Dlamini had lost hope of fulfilling her ancestral calling because she couldn’t afford to finish her journey of becoming a sangoma. She came to Daily Sun for help and now her ancestors have shown her the way. The story of Kholeka, who had to drop out of her thwasa process, touched sangoma Humphrey Nkomo and he stepped in to help. It was published in Daily Sun on Thursday and was about how Kholeka’s ancestors were angry at her. Sangoma Humphrey (50) of Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun he would help Kholeka for free. “I was touched when I read her story. I consulted my ancestors and discovered her ancestors were indeed angry.” He said nothing good would happen in her life until she completed the training. “When you start training to be a sangoma, you have to finish because leaving in the middle angers the ancestors.” He said such people could fall ill for a long period and even die. Humphrey said he would take her to the river for cleansing with four white chickens at the end of the month. He said a female white goat is needed to start the traditional ceremony. In the end, she has to slaughter a white goat and two white chickens where she lives to welcome the ancestors. He said after finishing the training in two months, her illness and back luck will disappear. Kholeka was happy when Humphrey visited her on Saturday night. “My calling will now come to pass after 15 years of suffering,” she said.
