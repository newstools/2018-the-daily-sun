POLICE in Ladysmith recovered 12 firearms that were stolen from a farm in Colenso, northern KZN. Two suspects, aged 30 and 39, were found in possession of the weapons on Sunday. They appeared in the Ladysmith Magistrates Court on Monday. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said after the farm owner reported his firearms stolen, police conducted an intelligence driven operation in Roosboom, outside Ladysmith, where the suspects were arrested. Zwane said five rifles, a revolver and a pistol were recovered during the operation. One suspect was charged with possession of stolen property. Zwane said the other suspect was only charged with housebreaking because he did not have any stolen property in his possession. “After interrogating the suspects, cops found three more rifles, a revolver and ammunition. “The farmer is believed to have used the firearms for hunting. Our officers worked around the clock to find the stolen guns,” said Zwane. He said the firearms were taken for ballistic tests to determine whether they had been used to commit any crimes.
