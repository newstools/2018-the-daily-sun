The Freedom Front Plus expressed its support for beleaguered Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga on the eve of a motion of no confidence in him. "The FF Plus in the Tshwane metro council supports the mayor Solly Msimanga's decision to investigate allegations of irregularities in the Glad Africa-contract in which the municipal manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola is involved," FF Plus councillor and mayco member Sakkie du Plooy said in a statement. "The FF Plus will therefore also vote against the motion of no confidence [in] the mayor that the ANC and EFF will bring at Thursday's council meeting." "The FF Plus calls on Msimanga to never back down, but to continue to investigate all allegations of corruption in the Tshwane metro." The FF Plus has four seats in the 214-seat council. Du Plooy said it would be to the council and the citizens' benefit if the ANC did not govern in the metro again. He said the multi-party coalition, of which the FF Plus forms part, is committed to quality service delivery and fighting corruption, irregular expenditure and incompetence. "The ANC's legacy after he governed the Tshwane metro council for about 20 years, is one of irregularities and poor service delivery," Du Plooy said. "The multi-party government is still progressing in turning this legacy around in the interest of all citizens and improving the municipality's service delivery and financial management." The EFF wants to bring the motion against Msimanga because he "allows white racists, who are exposed for taking jobs without the necessary qualifications, to retaliate and punishes the black City manager for exposing them". The DA said on Wednesday that they stood behind Msimanga. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said the ANC and EFF were on a quest to remove Msimanga for doing the right thing. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ff-plus-behind-msimanga-as-tshwane-vote-of-no-confidence-looms-20180829
