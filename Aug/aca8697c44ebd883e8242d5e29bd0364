AL Ahly has confirmed that former Bidvest Wits star Phakamani Mahlambi's proposed return to the Premier Soccer League has been called off. Mahlambi was linked with a move to PSL champions Mamelodi Sundowns, but any switch has now been ruled out after he was registered by the Red Devils for the upcoming Egyptian Premier League season. This follows the lengthy injury suffered by Junior Ajayi. The 20-year-old was so close to leaving Al Ahly in the current transfer window. He was linked with a return to Mzansi, however, Ajayiâ€™s injury has revived his hopes of getting more game time this season. Mahlambi joined Al Ahly last season from Bidvest Wits, scoring once and providing five assists in 15 appearances since then.
