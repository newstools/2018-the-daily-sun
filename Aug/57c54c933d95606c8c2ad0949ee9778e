WHEN the Mbathas heard that a man  accused of raping and murdering Sphelele, their relative, had died, they felt relieved. Lindo Mthembu from Macekane Reserve in Empangeni, northern KZN, was caught by residents, beaten and necklaced. They accused him of raping and strangling Sphelele. The matric pupil at Qhamuka High School was found dead in the bush on Tuesday, not far from her home. It’s believed Mthembu attacked Sphelele on Monday afternoon. Her family last saw her alive in the morning when she left for school. Sphelele’s brother Sizwe (31) said: “Even though it won’t bring back my sister, we’re relieved he’s dead. “It was very painful finding my sister’s lifeless body in the bushes, so we think he deserved what they did to him.” Sizwe said his family believed his sister’s spirit had avenged her. “She hasn’t even been buried yet but the suspect is also dead and died a painful death.” He said Sphelele’s spirit fought for her. The family didn’t go to the murder scene but were notified by residents. Residents were apparently able to identify Mthembu as the rapist by the sandals he left behind at the murder scene. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “Empangeni cops are investigating a case of murder following the killing of a 23-year-old man in Macekane Reserve.”
