TWO bogus tax practitioners who participated in a scam that
resulted in defrauding SARS R32 million, were sentenced to a combined 26 years
direct imprisonment last week. Cornelius Johannes Kriek (42) from the East Rand pleaded
guilty to 29 fraud charges, 21 money laundering charges, and one charge of
corrupting a public official. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in the Specialised
Commercial Crime Court. In the Cape Town Magistrateâ€™s Court, on 23 August, Thomas
Bloemeris Fortuin (66) from Ridgeworth in Bellville, was sentenced to six years
direct imprisonment on 236 charges of fraud and forgery relating to the tax
affairs of close corporations belonging to members of his family. He pleaded guilty to all the charges put to him in terms of
a plea bargain agreement reached with the state. Magistrate W van der Merwe handed down an additional 12
months imprisonment to Fortuin for failure to submit two Income Tax returns. Kriek presented himself as a bookkeeper to unsuspecting
Value Added Tax (VAT) vendors, offering swift and corrective action by
submitting VAT201 returns on their behalf. According to SARS suspicion was raised by a legitimate tax
practitioner who discovered that a large refund had been paid into the account
of her former client within a short while after the client had switched his
account to Kriek. Kriek was also sentenced to 84 years imprisonment, suspended
wholly, but conditionally for money laundering and ten years imprisonment for
corrupting a public official. Five of the ten years is to be served concurrently with
sentences for other charges. It is alleged that a former SARS employee, previously
employed by SARS as a VAT auditor for 35 years, assisted Kriek to commit the
fraud. SARS fraud investigators established that the VAT auditor
enabled the fraud by releasing substantial VAT refunds after she allegedly
audited the respective VAT 201s submitted by Kriek on behalf of vendors.
