residents have been warned of evil thugs who target houses after their owners have left for work. It’s alleged four unknown men drive around in a white Ford Bantam and wait for residents of Strand near Cape Town to leave for work so they can break in. Zuko Sikhafungana (27) told Daily Sun he saw the men trying to break into his mother’s house last Wednesday. “I’m usually at campus at that time, but I was home that day. “The men first knocked on the door of my backroom before going to my mother’s house.” Zuko said he didn’t open the door as he didn’t recognise any of the men. “They then took out hammers and tried to break the burglar gate of the house open. “I unlocked my door and they ran away.” Zuko said he ran after the men but couldn’t see their faces. He said he only saw the car they were driving. Another resident said the men broke into another house recently and stole a fridge. “We thought the fridge was being taken in for repairs because there was bakkie and the men didn’t cover their faces.” Residents told Daily Sun the burglaries had been going on for some time. Lwandle police spokesman Sergeant Mthokozisi Gama said there had been a decrease in robberies as police visibility in the area had increased. He urged community members to be more vigilant by keeping their windows closed and doors locked whenever they were away.
