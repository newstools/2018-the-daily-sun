Kaizer Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas said he cannot confirm reports of veteran midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala’s move to a Turkish Super Lig club Erzurumspor. Reports have been making rounds that Tshabalala will sign with Erzurumspor. Solinas did say that currently Tshabalala is not in Turkey. The Italian mentor said Tshabalala has been part of his training sessions this week as Chiefs are preparing for Sunday’s first leg of their MTN8 semi-final against SuperSport United at Lucas Moripe Stadium, 3pm. Solinas said: “I don’t speak about the transfer of players. I speak about the players who I have in the squad.” “Tshabalala was training with my team this morning‚ as normal. Because when they are in Kaizer Chiefs‚ I coach these players – no problem. “But I can’t speak about the transfer of players.” Solinas said Tshabalala is a crucial player to his plans. “For me Tshabalala is a very good player. He has made history with Chiefs. And I have a lot of respect for this player. But I can’t talk about transfers.”
