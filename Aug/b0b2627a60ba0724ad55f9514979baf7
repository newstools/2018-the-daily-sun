CCTV captured the moment a brave gogo fought off hijackers in England. The video shows the elderly woman throwing punches and flinging her bag at the thieves. The two hooded men can be seen attempting to steal her blue Audi Q3 in broad daylight right outside her home as she parked her car, reports the Dailymail. Not your ordinary granny The footage shows one of the assailants tussling with the elderly women, while another attempts to unlock the SUV. Thankfully a neighbour heard the commotion and helped chased the thieves away. The criminals fled the scene in a white VW Polo getaway car. According to Birmingham Live, she did not sustain any injuries. The West Midlands Police said the would-be carjackers are still at large and no arrests have been made.
