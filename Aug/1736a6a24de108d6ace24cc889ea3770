"Avoid having sex at times when the temperature is too high." UK INDEPENDENT quoted Santa Marta city health secretary Julio Salas’s has warning Colombians not to have sex because it is too hot. But his comments have been keenly debated after he called for residents of the Caribbean tourist hotspot not to have sex during the daytime. He issued the plea as part of a list of recommendations that also included staying hydrated and wearing loose clothing to avoid overheating. Temperatures in Santa Marta have hit 40C (104F) and Mr Salas said medical facilities in the city – which has a population of 600,000 – have been inundated with patients complaining about heatstroke symptoms, which include nausea and headaches. Countries across the world have faced drastically high temperatures this summer – cities from Tokyo to Montreal have set all-time heat records. Japan declared a natural disaster, with high temperatures resulting in thousands being admitted to hospital with heatstroke. “Avoid making love or having sex at times when the temperature is high, especially at noon, because this activity places physical demands on you and increases your heart rate,” Mr Salas said on a local radio station. He advised that if residents believe physical activity is absolutely necessary, they should wait until after sunset “or at times when the temperature is lower”, according to Colombia Reports. Sex is deemed only a moderate physical activity, as much of a strain on the heart as walking up two flights of stairs, according to the American Heart Association.
