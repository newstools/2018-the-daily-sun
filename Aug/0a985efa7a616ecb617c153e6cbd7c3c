IT’S hardly a month since popular Thohoyandou taxi owner William Nethononda was gunned down outside his home. Nethononda (71) was a member of the Venda-Joburg Taxi Association. Now another taxi owner from the same association has been killed. Nthambeleni Tshishonga (49) of Maniini outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo, was attacked by three armed men at a car wash on Thursday. Many people believe Tshishonga’s killing was related to taxi violence. A witness said he had tried to run away when he saw the men, but they shot at him several times. A resident said: “We are in shock. “We don’t know what is happening in the taxi business. “Three weeks ago Nethononda was killed. Now it’s Tshishonga “We don’t feel safe anymore because bullets often fly in the area.” Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said cops were investigating. “The suspects are not known at this stage and the motive is not yet clear,” he said. “But taxi violence can’t be ruled out.”
