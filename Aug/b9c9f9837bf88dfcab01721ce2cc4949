Kaizer Chiefs took a 2-0 advantage but were pegged back to a 2-2 draw in Wednesday's Absa Premiership clash against Bloemfontein Celtic at FNB Stadium. The result mean Amakhosi will continue with their search of first three points in the 2018/19 campaign as they have now gone five matches without tasting a victory in the league. Last season Chiefs' many draws were one of many reasons why they failed to challenge for the league title as they played 12 draws in 30 league matches. Again this season, the Soweto giants are seem to be continuing with the trend of playing draws as they have now drew four of their five league encounters. It was Celtic who came out strongly and nearly took the advantage in the sixth minute when Tshegofatso Mabaso stole into space and latched on to a square pass but he struck his effort wide at the near post. In the 14th minute the same player came close again as he found space and fired a strike on target which Bruce Bavuma saved superbly. The lively Dumisani Zuma nearly made it 1-0 but he hit the bar in the 26th minute. It would have perhaps been a Goal-of-the-Season contender had it gone in.With that said, Khama Billiat got the opener when he broke clear before slotting home with precision beyond Patrick Tignyemb in the Celtic goal.After the break, Chiefs added to the score-line as Khotso Malope got into the act. Sent clear by Leo Castro, he dinked a superb finish over the Tignyemb. But Celtic fought back with Menzi Masuku scoring in the 75th minute after a superb set-up by Ndumiso Mabena.Three minutes later the experienced forward shocked Chiefs fans as he struck home a brilliant leveler which ensured Steve Komphela who was playing against Chiefs for te first time since he left the club in April goes back to Bloemfontein with a point.
