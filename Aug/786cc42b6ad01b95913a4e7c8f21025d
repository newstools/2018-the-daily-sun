An employee of the University of Rhodes has told Daily
Sun that the University is not sure whether Khensani Maseko was raped on
varsity premises. This was after the University issued a statement concerning
the death of Maseko. Maseko committed suicide last week after she reported
that she was raped. “Khensani passed away after reporting on Monday 30 July,
a rape which allegedly took place in May,” read the statement. “The University immediately made contact with her family
and they travelled the next day from Johannesburg to Grahamstown for a meeting
where they elected to take Khensani home for a while. “It was also agreed at the meeting that Rhodes University
will follow up on the matter.” However, when Daily Sun pressed for more clarity on where
Maseko was raped, the employee who refused to be identified said that the
University was “not sure whether the rape took place” on the campus. The University also said that the alleged perpetrator has
been issued a notice of suspension. Rhodes students and the public marched to Settler’s
Monument in Grahamstown on Tuesday (7 August), where a series of talks on
sexual consent will be discussed. “We hope that this tragic incident will allow the
University an opportunity to reflect and to engage, even deeper, on how we must
pull together as a University and society to eliminate the scourge of
gender-based violence once and for all. This is the most fitting and lasting
tribute we can give Khensani,” the university’s Vice Chancellor Dr Sizwe
Mabizela said.
