THE director of the Growing Up Without a Father Foundation hosted a business breakfast to raise awareness of the impact of fatherlessness on a nation in Tshwane on Saturday. Charley Pietersen, who is also an author, hosted the event. The impact on kids growing up in a fatherless households was discussed. Among the speakers were former public protector Thuli Madonsela, actor Zane Meas and life coach and author, Kofi Ofori-Boateng. Pietersen said the discussion aimed to bring healing about fatherless, and to create awareness around this painful situation. He said he grew up without a father and knew of the anger and hatred that comes with it. “We have witnessed a lot of killing of women in the country. If you check the background of men who kill, you will see that most of them come from single mother households or households with no parents.” Meas told the men present that they were important and had a role to play in their kids’ lives. He encouraged them to break the cycle of violence. Mandonsela told guests that being fatherless is sometimes better than having an abusive or drunkard for a father. Guests asked several questions on how to move forward after the pain of growing up without fathers.
