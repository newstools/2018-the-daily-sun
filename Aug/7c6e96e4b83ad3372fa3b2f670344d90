USUALLY when cops remove izinyoka, residents fight with them and they end up not removing the illegal cables. But in the early hours of yesterday morning, Ekurhuleni Metro cops removed izinyoka while the squatters were asleep. When the people of Dukathole squatter camp in Germiston woke up, they found the izinyoka gone. Themba Gadebe, a spokesman for Ekurhuleni Municipality, said the operation to remove izinyoka was led by the energy department and Metro cops. He said two men who are behind the illegal connections were bust.Tiisetso Nketle, a member of the mayoral committee for energy, said: “The aim of the operation was to restore fully functional electrical network in the area and surroundings places. “This was after four transformers exploded recently due to the heavy load caused by illegal connections.” Metro Police Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago confirmed the arrest of the two izinyoka. Residents have been urged to report any illegal connection or suspicion of illegal connection activities to 086 054 3000.
