SINCE last April, 10 Joburg Metro have been run over by motorists during road checks or while directing traffic. The tenth incident happened on Thursday night when a cop was hit by a motorist who dragged her for a short distance. This was after cops tried to stop the motorist, who evaded a roadside check. According to JMPD Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar, the driver of a black BMW ignored a roadside check on Eloff Street in Joburg. While being chased by the cops, he drove through two red lights. Minnaar said when the driver stopped, the cop stood in front of the car but the driver ran her over and dragged her for a short distance. He then drove away but was cut off at Webber and Eloff Streets, where he was arrested. The cop is currently in hospital with a fracture of her right hand. “The driver of the BMW is currently in custody and will appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court today to face charges of attempted murder, reckless and neglect driving, inconsiderate driving and assault,” said Minnaar. He said the driver wasn’t drunk when he was arrested. However, he didn’t have a driver’s licence and the licence disk on the car was expired. Minnaar told Daily Sun they want to arrest as many reckless drivers as possible through Operation Buya Mthetho.
