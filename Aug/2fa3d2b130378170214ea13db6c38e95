THE widow of a man who died in a bus crash with six others on Saturday said she thanks God for sparing her. Nomfundo Khumalo (36) told Daily Sun she was grateful she and her kids were not in the bus when it crashed on the R66 between Eshowe and Melmoth in northern KZN. The seven-month pregnant mum from Alexandra in Joburg said she was supposed to be in the bus with her husband Vusimuzi (34) and their four kids to attend the 40th anniversary of the Twelve Apostle Church in Christ in Empangeni. “We had planned to all go to the celebration, but on Thursday. I changed my mind and asked my husband if I could remain behind with the kids,” she said. “To my surprise, he didn’t turn me down as he would normally do. “He was strict about us attending church events as a family.” She said after she learned of the accident, she realised it was part of God’s plan that she and the kids remained behind. “To think that two months from now I’m going to give birth to a child who won’t know the feeling of being loved by his dad makes me tearful,” said Nomfundo. Church spokesman Dududu Maganu said five members died at the scene while two others died in hospital. “Most of them have been discharged but 11 others are still critical and in hospital. We’re making arrangements to get them transferred to hospitals in Gauteng so their families can visit them.” KZN Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda told the media earlier this week the driver lost control and crashed the bus.
