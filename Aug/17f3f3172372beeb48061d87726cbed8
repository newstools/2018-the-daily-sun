ELEVEN shops in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, Uitenhage were closed on Friday for selling expired food. Some of these shops were found selling food dated as long ago as 2016. Lance Grootboom, a member of the mayoral committee for public health and health inspectors visited 36 shops and stalls to check on food. “Three of the eleven shops have been confiscated,” said Grootboom. “At one of the shops we discovered that all the stock was expired.” He said people must make sure the food offered at special prices was okay to be eaten. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said they identified shops that didn’t get rid of expired food. “All these practices cause a high risk of the outbreak of diseases such as Listeriosis. “We have searched through shelves and storerooms at a number of shops in areas identified to be hot spots such as taxi ranks, Central Hill and Korsten in the CBD,” he said. Mniki said the operation would cover every corner of the metro. “We want to make sure that operators who sell, prepare and serve food in the metro are sticking to the environmental health rules and regulations.”
