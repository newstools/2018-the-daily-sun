WOMEN who took part in fights over leadership were wasting their time. Henrietta Bogopane-Zulu said this to women from Mawewe in Mpumalanga on Wednesday. The launch of the Women Empowerment Framework was attended by Mpumalanga Social Development MEC Busi Shiba, chief Khulile Mkhatshwa and other VIPs. The project aims to empower women in rural areas, taking into account their right to productive land. It will assist them with skills development and support co-operatives led by women. It will also improve access to funding and marketing opportunities for their businesses. Earlier this year, the Mawewe people marched to the provincial government office to deliver a memorandum demanding the removal of headwoman Khulile Mkhatshwa. She was accused of stealing the chieftaincy from rightful chief Candy Mkhatshwa. Bogopane-Zulu said the department couldn’t assist residents with their fights. “You should have been assisted long ago but we decided to watch you fight and in the meantime, you were stealing your own development, while being used to bring other women down. “Violence doesn’t bring development, only fear and division. Women need to stop people who are trying to divide this community,” she said.
