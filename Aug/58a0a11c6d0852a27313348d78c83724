FOUR suspected car thieves will spend time behind bars until their case is finalised. Their bail was opposed when they appeared in the Lindley Magistrates Court in the Free State on Wednesday. Telang Malefane (40), Makeka Mavuso (42) and Aupa Radebe (47) were caught on the R707 near Lindley in the early hours of 20 June, after allegedly stealing a white Toyota Land Cruiser in Petrus Steyn. Police spokesman Captain Zweli Mohebeleli told Daily Sun the four men were arrested during a combined police operation involving visible policing, crime intelligence and the vehicle crime investigation unit, who targeted several towns in the province. Police investigations soon led to Pule Sello (34), who was arrested for theft of another vehicle in Lindley in July. Mohebeleli said investigations aimed at tracing other suspects are under way. “Despite the breakthrough, we advise vehicle owners to exercise caution and increase security on their properties,” said Mohobeleli. “This can be done by installing gear locks, alarm systems and trackers “Vehicles must not be left unlocked or in the streets overnight.” The suspects will appear in the same court again on 24 August.
