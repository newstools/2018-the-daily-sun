KGOTSO Mokhele is worried that he might not write his final examinations at the end of the year. The grade 12 pupil from Leandra in Secunda, Mpumalanga, does not have an ID. He is asking for help from the department of home affairs. The 21-year-old told Daily Sun that his parents are from Lesotho but he was born in South Africa. Kgotso, who lives with his father, said they struggled to get an ID for him while his mum was still alive. “We tried several times to approach the local Home Affairs but my parents were told they need to take me to Lesotho to get an ID from there,” said Kgotso. He said his parents once went to Lesotho to try to get him an ID but their attempts failed. They were told to come back to South Africa because Kgotso was born in this country. Home Affairs spokesman, Thabo Mokgola said if the young man was born in Mzanzi he must have some form of proof to present to the department. He said he must present records from the hospital he was born in for him to be assisted. Mokgola advised him to ask his local office which documents were needed. Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said all pupils from foreign countries must have a school permit obtained through home affairs. He said it is compulsory for every pupil to be documented.
