Kaizer Chiefs new acquisition Mario Booysen says he has always aspired to Amakhosi and believes are 'far ahead of all other South African clubs'. The former SuperSport United and Mamelodi Sundowns defender was unveiled by Amakhosi on Wednesday evening after the Soweto giants announced arrival of Bafana Bafana attacking midfielder Lebohang Manyama. The 30-year-old joined from Ajax Cape Town with close to 200 top flight matches during stints at SuperSport, Sundowns, Maritzburg United and Bloemfontein Celtic. Booysen told Chiefs’ website: “If you set yourself goals‚ you aim for the best and Chiefs are just that. It’s been a lifelong aspiration to play for this club as I have always felt that Kaizer Chiefs are far ahead of all other South African clubs. They are true leaders‚ all others follow.“I promise them that when I put my foot on the field‚ I will always do my utmost best to put a smile on their faces.“Everybody can expect me to give 100 percent commitment to Amakhosi. The club offers me a fresh challenge and I want to add value.“I am definitely looking at winning trophies‚ making the club and supporters proud. I want to make a real contribution to the legacy of this great club.”
