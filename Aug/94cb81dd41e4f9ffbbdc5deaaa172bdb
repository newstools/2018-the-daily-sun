A KENYAN 400m hurdles champion has had his life cut short by a car accident. According to The Guardian, Nicholas Bett (28) returned from the African championships in Nigeria on Monday. At about 6am on Wednesday morning, his Toyota Prado SUV apparently hit bumps in the road and rolled, according to his coach Vincent Mumo. Nicholas had been driving on  the road between Eldoret and Kapsabet, two famous distance-running training towns in the country’s Rift Valley region in the west of the country. Nicholas was the 2015 world champion in 400m hurdles event. He also won bronze medals at the African championships in 2014 in the 400 hurdles and 4x400m relay. His twin brother, Aaron, is also a star athlete. He was one of the four man team to win gold for Kenya at the recent African championships in the 4x400m event. President Uhuru Kenyatta was among the many who expressed their sorrow at the tragic loss. Deeply saddened by the death of former 400m hurdles World Champion Nicholas Bett who died today in a tragic road accident. Bett earned the country great honours in his outstanding victories. My deepest sympathies and heartfelt condolences to his family, relatives and friends. pic.twitter.com/9Xgqt1tFr3
