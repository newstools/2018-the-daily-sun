MASONTAHA Miya (28) regrets having an affair. She claims her ex-boyfriend burnt down her marital home in Bluegumbosch, QwaQwa on Sunday while her sister was asleep. Mapuleng Miya (21), burnt to death while Masontaha’s daughter Dimpho (6) escaped death but sustained serious injuries. Masontaha claims her ex saw her at a local shopping centre earlier that day and threatened to burn down her house if she didn’t take him back. She ignored the threats, but had no idea her house would be set alight while she was at a tavern. Masontaha said: “He tried to force me to sleep at his house but I refused. “Then he threatened to come to my house that night and burn it to the ground because I was no longer in love with him.” She said she regrets cheating on her husband. “I messed up and now my sister is dead. I don’t think my husband will forgive me for what I did.” Masontaha’s husband Lefu Masoeu said he received a call while he was at work in Mpumalanga. He said he was shocked when he heard his house was on fire. “When I got home, all of our belonging had turned into heaps of ash. I couldn’t believe what I saw when I get into the house. “Everything I’ve worked hard for was burnt to a crisp,” said Lefu. “Over the past three years, my wife and I have argued a lot about her cheating. “On several occasions, I saw the WhatsApp messages sent to her by her boyfriends. “It is painful to see a corpse taken out of my house because of my irresponsible wife.” Police spokesman Sergeant Mmako Mophiring confirmed the incident and said an inquest was opened. He said the man accused of burning the house is still at large.
