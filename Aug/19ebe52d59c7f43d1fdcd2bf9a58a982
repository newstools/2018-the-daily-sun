THE cow was slaughtered in the back of the bakkie and was on its way to be cooked – but then the cops arrived. When cops from Pampierstad, near Hartswater in the Northern Cape, stopped him the 27-year-old man couldn’t produce papers to prove the carcass belonged to him. Now he’s behind bars and the bakkie has been confiscated. Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock said the man was driving alone in a white Nissan bakkie on Saturday when cops stopped and searched the vehicle. Kock told Daily Sun: “Pampierstad police followed up on information of alleged stock theft and stopped and searched the bakkie. Our members found the carcass of a slaughtered cow. One suspect was arrested for allegedly stealing the cow from a nearby farm. “The white Nissan bakkie was also confiscated by the police as it was allegedly utilised in the commission of a crime.” Kock said the suspect was charged with stock theft and will appear in court soon. In another incident, Pampierstad cops followed up on alleged stolen livestock being kept at a cattle post in Pampierstad. “We found 18 cows that were recently stolen from farms in the area. “No arrests have been made yet as the cattle post could not be linked to anyone specific. The livestock is valued at about R200 000.”
