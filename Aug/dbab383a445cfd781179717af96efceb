ANGRY  shack dwellers say their municipality has no time for them. They said if they hadn’t been moved from their old shacks to new ones a few months ago, their belongings wouldn’t have been destroyed last week. During the heavy storm, about 100 shacks were flooded in Motherwell NU29 kasi. Residents’ furniture, groceries, clothing and school uniforms were soaked in water. Flood victim Feziwe Koli (53) told Daily Sun: “Life here is worse than living at the Powerline squatter camp. At least we had the bucket system toilets. My shack was not exposed to floods and we had a communal tap.” On Saturday, community leader Mzingisi Makeleni told Daily Sun: “We blame the municipality for this mess. “When we demanded homes, we wanted decent houses with toilets and fresh water. “What we experience here is human indignity. There are no toilets and taps. People relieve themselves in the bush,” he said. The affected residents were temporary accommodated at NU13 Community Hall. “We thank the local spaza shops and businesses for providing food to the victims. “The municipal disaster team supplied blankets and mattresses but that was a temporary solution. We need permanent ones,” said Makeleni. He demanded that the municipality build them houses immediately. Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “We will investigate the matter. However, some people have been moved from stressed areas to serviced sites. Their shack were rebuilt as they are waiting for houses to be built.”
