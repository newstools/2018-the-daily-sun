LEFU Moeketsi’s business is doing well. The 63-year-old from section A in Botshabelo started a small business after he realised there was a lot of demand for fresh milk. Lefu said he always dreamed of running a business, but financial problems forced him to give up on his dream. He then landed a job at a bus company and he was assigned to night duty. Lefu said he sold boiled eggs to his colleagues and used the profit he made to start his milk business. “I have been working night shifts for more than 25 years. “That is what helped me start this business,” said the madala. The father of seven said that he buys his milk from a farm outside Botshabelo. He then drives around his kasi with cartons of milk in his bakkie. He honks his bakkie’s hooter to draw the attention of customers. Lefu said starting his business was not easy, but with the help of his son, Mojalefa (26), he managed to overcome challenges and create a steady customer base. “When people found out I charge as little as R4, they demanded more milk,” said Lefu. Although some people accused him of being greedy, Lefu said that he paid no mind to the critics. He told the SunTeam what mattered was the fact that he had made his dream come true “I love what I do.”
