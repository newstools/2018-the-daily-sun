“NO to ukuthwala and the abuse of women and children!” This was the message education department officials, workers and managers had when they marched to the SAPS regional offices in Mthatha on Monday. Delivering their petition, Lindiwe Ngunge, an official from the regional office, said alcohol abuse and drugs were the main causes of abuse. “We call upon the police to act swiftly in cases of rape, murder and the abuse of women. “The justice system must be harsh to perpetrators and there should be no bail for the accused. “Police must be visible all the time and do random searches at schools for drugs and dangerous weapons,” she said. Ngunge said women didn’t even feel safe when they went to work. “We’re here to raise our concerns. We say no more shall we be subjected to rape and murder.” Accepting the petition on behalf of provincial police commissioner General Liziwe Ntshinga, Mthatha acting commander Brigadier Nomawethu Makhonza said they took note of all the complaints raised. “On our side, we will do all we can to fight crimes against women. Your pain is our pain,” he said. “All we ask is that you, as the community, help us to fight crime by reporting it and testifying in court.” Andile Mtirara, acting director of the provincial education department, said they were committed to fighting the abuse of women. “We go to all the districts to have dialogues. “At the end of the month, we’ll have a provincial programme,” he said. Akhona Nolala, an employee at the department, said they faced a lot of challenges at work. “We mostly work with men, so that makes us vulnerable to abuse.”
