THE murder case against Colonel Cordelia Mogoerane was postponed yesterday because the docket had not been brought to the Kempton Park Magistrates Court. The prosecutor said they were still investigating. She and seven co-accused allegedly murdered her husband Brigadier Hendrick Mogoerane, a retired intelligence officer, earlier this year. He was killed at his home in Norkem Park, Ekurhuleni, a few months after retiring. His body was dumped on the side of the road in Tembisa. The state has alleged that Cordelia paid Muziweshinga Zondo, Bongisiwe Lukhele, Musa Mayisela, Ntombizodwa Dlamini, Thulani Nxumalo, Sanele Mphuthi and Thokozani Zondo to murder the former cop. All the accused were linked to the murder through DNA. Cordelia (57) allegedly drugged Hendrick with muthi she got from Dlamini, a sangoma, before his killers entered the house. All the accused are out on bail except for Mayisela, whose address hasn’t been verified. Mayisela’s bail application is expected to be heard today. The other accused were told to return to court on 12 October.
