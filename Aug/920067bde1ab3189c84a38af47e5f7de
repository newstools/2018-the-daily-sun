IT is difficult to plan for Mamelodi Sundowns, let alone beat them. So says Highlands Park coach Owen Da Gama, as he looks ahead to another stern Absa Premiership test, this time against the star-studded Brazilians at Loftus Versfeld tomorrow (7.30pm). “They are the defending champions, unbeaten so far locally, and have enough quality to put up three strong teams,” said Da Gama, listing a number of impressive Sundowns players. “You can’t plan against them. They can either start with (Sibusiso) Vilakazi and (Gaston) Sirino in attack, or with Jeremy Brockie supported by two attacking players behind him. They can play many combinations. They also have new players, such as Lebohang Maboe, Andile Jali and the South American (Ali Meza). Yes, we definitely know what we will be up against tomorrow.” Da Gama says, however, that he relishes the challenge against Downs in a match that could easily serve as a yardstick to gauge how much work lies ahead to build a formidable team. He reckons such sterner tests can only help his team adapt to the rigours of the Premiership and improve. Highlands hung on for dear life as they held Orlando Pirates to a 1-1 draw in their opening league match and a week later threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Black Leopards. “It’s good for us to face big teams early in the season. You learn quickly and get better as a team. Things are very tough in the PSL, especially with nine debutants in your side,” he added. “We have rewarded a lot of players from the First Division. Some of them are going to be able to step up‚ some might not be able to step up. “You could see nobody expected us to beat Pirates. And we threw victory away against Leopards, conceding two goals in five minutes. “Sundowns will definitely be favourites to win tomorrow. But we have 90 minutes of football to play. We believe in what we do, as much as the opponents trust in themselves,” said the coach.
