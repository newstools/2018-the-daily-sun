THE University of Fort Hare is investigating yet another assault case at its Alice campus. Last Saturday a student allegedly attacked a woman guard at a residence and threatened to stab her. A video of the incident was posted on the university’s Facebook page. Guard Zoliswa Mkolo said three men students came into the residence drinking beer. “One was very drunk and rude but I didn’t pay much attention to him. Hardly 10 minutes after I let them in, a woman student came running to tell me a male student had barged into her room.” Zoliswa said when she went to check, the man was sleeping on the girl’s bed. “I asked him what he was doing there and he said his girlfriend lived there but the girls in that room didn’t know him. I told him to leave but he refused.” She said he then tried to klap the girl but she got in between them. “That is when he punched me on my mouth,” she said. In the video, the man is heard shouting: “Ndizakuhlaba unye (I will stab you). A male student can be seen assisting Zoliswa. “I have been shaking since that night. I’m scared to go back to campus but need my job as I have a family to support,” she said. In another recent incident, a male student kicking a woman student on the university premises was also captured on video. SRC president Xolani Jaji said such behaviour is not acceptable and the university should take action against the student. University spokesman, Khotso Moabi said the incident was being investigated by the university’s internal investigator. “Our security has been briefed to be vigilant and tighten security on all our campuses.”
