THE Makhathinis from Thornwood in Mariannhill, west of Durban, are still in shock. They found three of their family members stabbed to death and the alleged killer hanging from the rafters yesterday morning! Family member Fikile Makhathini (37), who lives a short distance away, told Daily Sun a priest who had come to fetch the family for the Sunday church service alerted them that something was amiss. “The priest normally fetched them every Sunday. He suspected something was odd when he knocked at the door but no one answered. He notified us before he went to church,” said Fikile. She said they went to check and, on arrival, stumbled on the bloody scene. Mum Thembi Nzama (57), her daughter-in-law Philile Njakazi (24), and her four-month-old granddaughter were found stabbed to death. Her son Khulekani (21) was found hanging. Fikile said a two-year-old girl was unharmed. It’s alleged Khulekani stabbed the three members of his family to death before hanging himself. “Khulekani used to say he was going to kill his baby mama, but we never thought he meant it,” said Fikile. KZN cops spokeswoman Nqobile Gwala confirmed the family murder.
