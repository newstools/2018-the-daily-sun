A video of a Lamborghini Huracán driver showing total
disrespect for traffic officers has surfaced on social media. In the video, a cop can be seen pulling over the Lamborghini
driver. The driver slows down and comes to a stop, but before the
cop could get out – the Lamborghini driver started spinning the car around the
police suv. After he did it a couple of times, then sped off from the
scene.
