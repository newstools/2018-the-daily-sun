COPS have recovery of a hijacked truck and arrested three men
in Vereeniging. They also recovered boxes of Jack Daniels Whiskey to the
value of about R3 million that were in the hijacked truck. “It is alleged that the driver of the truck was stopped by a
VW Golf GTI and BMW that were fitted with blue lights. Then six suspects confronted the driver and took him to one
of the suspects' car before he was dropped off few kilometres away,” Captain
Mavela Masondo said. The Sedibeng Tracing Team recovered the truck in the yard of
one of the houses in Vereeniging where three suspects were arrested. Masondo said preliminary investigation led to the recovery
of the boxes of Jack Daniels Whiskey that were already loaded in another truck. Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects that are
still at large and the cargo that is still missing. The arrested suspects will appear at Johannesburg and
Vereeniging Magistrate's Courts facing charges of hijacking and possession of
hijacked truck.
