RESIDENTS of Hostel One have been without electricity  for two weeks. After experiencing load-shedding for a long time, they reported the matter to Centlec, which supplies electricity in Mangaung. But the suppliers’ workers came and disconnected it instead! Gladys Masithela (78) said her food was rotting in the fridge. She suffers from diabetes and needed to keep insulin treatment in a cold place. “We can’t live in the dark, so we use paraffin lamps,” said Gladys. She said paraffin and candles were too expensive. “People go hungry because they have to throw food away,” she said. “Some people get sick because they have no choice but to eat the rotting food.” The gogo said she was forced to buy a paraffin stove and home-made paraffin lamp. Nthabiseng Kwena (34), who’s unemployed, said: “We can’t live like this. ‘It’s the people who steal electricity whom Centlec must punish, not us.” Centlec spokesman Lele Mamatu said power at Hostel One was disconnected after inspectors found izinyoka, which he insisted posed a danger to residents, especially kids. “We’ll start formalising connections to residences this week in order to ensure electricity is safe and customers are paying for the power they use,” he said. “We’re still going to install meters and do house connections for the 80 affected households.” They were hoping to complete the project soon. “We’re appealing to community members to avoid illegal connections,” he said. “They pose a serious danger that may result in loss of life.”
