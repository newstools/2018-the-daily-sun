On the 1st of November 2018, the Turffontein Racecourse will, once again, host the annual Gauteng Summer Cup. This remains one of the country’s favourite horse-racing events, and is certainly the longest running horse events in Johannesburg. At the launch held in Good Luck Bar, Johannesburg on August 22, Joburg’s oldest race day announced their new headline sponsor, G-BETS. The day will be one of massive excitement, and fans can look forward to 12 horse races, which guarantee plenty of fun. In addition to the actual racing, this event focuses on the trendiest of haute couture fashion fads. But, even those who don’t want to follow the hot-listers should dress with liberal amounts of style and elegance in celebration of this chic event. This means that gents should wear suits and jackets and ladies should have an elegant hat. The Gauteng Summer Cup is ideal for families with little ones too, as they can watch the horses run or visit them in the parade rink. There is also a carnival with exciting rides, buskers and face-painters on offer. Local talent will put on a show that guarantees all-day entertainment. The line-up includes some excellent South African performers that know how to create a fab vibe and get the crowd going. One of the highlights (apart from the horses racing around the track) is watching celebrities compete against each other in the 'It's a rush charity dash'. The money raised in this initiative is donated to a worthy cause. The Gauteng Summer Cup is all about fun, festivity, fashion and food, with liberal amounts of world-class horse racing.
