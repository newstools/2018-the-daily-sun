RESIDENTS from Mtubatuba and surrounding areas in the north of KZN are calling for intervention from the provincial South Africa Social Security Agency. The angry residents told Daily Sun that they have been going to the local office for several days without getting any help. They said the officials allegedly told them they can only serve 20 people a day. One resident (30) from Mvutshini Village, KwaMsane said for the past two weeks, she has been going to this office to apply for a child support grant for her daughter. “When I get there I always find long queues of other residents who are not served. We wait for several hours and then we are told to go back home. “When we come back the following day, the same thing happens again,” said the resident. “I spend R80 a day when I go there. I should be able to do the application in a few days because I don’t have money to go up and down as I am not employed.” Another resident (44) said they needed clarity from the province on how many people could be served daily. “We need to know because we find it very strange that they tell us that they can only serve 20 people when they see us packed in the office. Secondl, we get angry when they say this because we see some of them busy giggling and chatting on their phones.” KZN Sassa spokesman Vusi Mahaye said: “We will lodge an investigation into these allegations and take necessary steps. What I am aware of is that four officials left and four vacancies were left unfilled in that office, but that does not mean the remaining officials should turn people away.”
