RECORDED live birth statistics show that 989 318 births were registered in South Africa last year. These statistics were released by Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke in Tshwane yesterday. Maluleke said this showed an increase of 2,1% from 969 415 births in 2016. He said the majority of the births were those of boys, at 460 774, against the birth of 425 725 girls. This had resulted in the sex ratio of 102 to 100. No comparable or reliable information on the fathers could be provided due to a high proportion of births being registered without their details. Maluleke said the two most populous provinces, Gauteng and KZN, had the highest number of total birth registrations, with Gauteng at 239 457 and KZN at 197 913. “The lowest number of birth registrations were observed in Northern Cape (24 395) and Free State (50 130). These are in line with the population sizes of the provinces,” he said. Maluleke said the age group 30 to 34 accounted for the most births, at 95,5%, followed by 25- to 29-year-olds, at 95,1%, and 35- to 39-year-olds, at 94,7%. He said the most popular first name recorded for boys was Enzokuhle followed by Lethabo and Melokuhle.
