HE is old and ill and looks as if he could die soon. But the lady who is taking care of the mkhulu fears that he will pass away without his family. Cynthia Tamane, (39) from Glen Hazel in Joburg, is pleading with SunReaders to help her find the family of William Meyer (78). “I am afraid of what might happen to him when he dies. “He is old and he deserves a decent funeral. We need to find his family,” said Cynthia. Cynthia said William had been in and out of hospital for a while. “It can be extremely challenging when you realise a good friend has memory loss. “It is a common problem, but at this stage it is even scarier because he is sick and remembers no one from his family.” Cynthia has tried to track down his family, but with no success. “I have looked at the hospitals where he was admitted before, but even they do not have a record of his family,” she said. “No one was there when he was discharged.” Cynthia said when she raised the question about his family, William frowned and reacted in a funny way. She suspects that his family might have done something that caused him to become alienated from them for so many years. “We do not know what might have happened, but whatever happened is history. “It is not good for a person of his age and situation to be away from his family,” Cynthia said. “I do not know what to do. “Please help me.”
