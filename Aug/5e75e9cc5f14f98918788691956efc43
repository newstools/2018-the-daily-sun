Local rapper Nasty C is going through some “Bad Hair” days at the moment. This after he recently got a haircut presumably at a barber shop in the United States that left a lot to be desired. And to say the rapper was not happy with the barber’s efforts would be an understatement. He took to social media to share with his fans how disappointed he was with the haircut and to slam the barber for the rather sloppy haircut. “F*** this barber,” he captioned a picture showing the haircut on Twitter. “I played myself,” he said, “This barber made me wanna do a full reset, but I can’t imagine myself bald chiskop? Awngeke. “How am I supposed to glow like this,” he tweeted. Although some of his fans on social media were sympathetic, many could not help but see the funny side and poke fun at the rapper through hilarious memes. Nasty C has a music video shoot for his hit King featuring ASAP Ferg coming up and he is determined to get his hair back in proper shape. He posted a video of himself trying out a possible solution to his problem. “With the grace of God, my hair will be back and boomin before the Ivyson Tour,” he added.
