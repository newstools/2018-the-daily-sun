TWO friends have opened a takkie washing business in Seiseng Road in Batho kasi, Mangaung, Free State. The men said they started it to earn a living and stay away from crime. Teboho Collins (26) said they began washing takkies, mats and sofas two years ago. “I am so happy to leave the life behind of running from cops and doing wrong things. I live peacefully and get clean money. I left school early and hope to go back one day.” He said they went door to door, asking people to bring them their dirty shoes.“We make sure we wash them thoroughly.” Tey wash takkies for R20 a pair. “We wash six pairs a day,” he said. Lebohang Moleha (26) said: “Our business helps me buy food. Youths doing crime should rather open businesses or find jobs.”
