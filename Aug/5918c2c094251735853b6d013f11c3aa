WHEN residents heard police sirens wailing in their kasi, they assumed that they were attending to an emergency. But they were wrong. The cops were there to give food parcels to some of the residents. Thanks to Thabong police and Goldfields Rotary Club, more than 400 5kg bags of mealie-meal and blankets were handed to residents of Thabong kasi in Welkom, Free State, on Friday. This big initiative was led by Dulcie Harris from Rotary. Police spokesman Captain Malebo Khosana told Daily Sun: “Thabong social crime prevention members and the CPF took to the streets to distribute blankets and maize meal.” He added that the initiative started about 13 years ago when Thabong cops and the Rotary Club joined hands. “The aim is to eradicate poverty and build good relations with the community,” he said. “Child-headed households, the needy and elderly were given first priority.” Thabong commander Major-General Apaphia Modise said: “This project is part of our approach to fighting crime. “Thanks to Thabong station commander Brigadier Cynthia Molale and her team for doing a great job. “I also thank all the sponsors for partnering with us.”
