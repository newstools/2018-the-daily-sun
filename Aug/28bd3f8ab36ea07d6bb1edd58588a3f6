Local Hip-Hop artist and producer Sean Pages has opened up about a traumatic experience he had as a child. The Wadijaja hit-maker revealed on social media on Sunday morning that he had been molested by his own uncle as a child. HE said his uncle was “a notorious and cold-hearted thug who raped so many people's daughters, robbed and killed many people's fathers and sons” back in the 1980s. Sean said his world “felt a burst of new freedom” when he heard that his uncle was recently found riddled with AK47 bullets in the Juskei River. He said it was just as well someone got to him first because he had vowed to one day kill his uncle with his bare hands for what he did to him. “Most evil man I knew, he might've taught me how to use a gun, make petrol bombs and even make homemade guns but mans wasn't s***,” one of the tweets in the thread read. “Was molested by that for a lot of years and that s*** f***** me up. “Grew up an angry a** kid. Always breaking people's s*** and burning whatever I could put a match on,” he wrote. Sean said he could not even tell his mother about the abuse because his uncle had threatened to kill him if he ever did. He said this affected his life and made him “socially awkward” as he would get violent anytime another guy got too close for his liking. However, the incident also taught him to be protective of is loved ones and never let them go through anything similar. “There's an upside to this though. I'm straight protective of my people and never ever want them to experience this type of s*** coz I know the pain and won't even wish that shit on my worst enemy,” he added. The rapper subsequently received an outpouring of support from his peers in the industry as well as fans.
