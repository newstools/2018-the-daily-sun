ZULU king Goodwill Zwelithini said women should continue to make it their responsibility to teach kids the good ways of life. The king was referring to abstinence, avoiding alcohol and drugs and focusing on getting education. He was speaking at the Umkhosi Wesivivane in Khangelamankengane Palace in Nongoma, north of KZN on Saturday. The event is an annual gathering of women from different parts of the province and from Swaziland. During the gathering they discuss challenges that they face as women in their homes and come up with solutions. The king said: “Children of today abuse drugs, alcohol and engage in sexual activities before time. It is on your shoulders as women to show them the right way to handle their lives.” He reminded people of the importance of respect and listening to women. “We are this old because of them. They could have done anything to us because they always have the power to do anything. Let us grab all the good advice they give us while they are still alive so we can pass them to future generations.” In his speech, the king said his first wife, Queen Mntanenkosi was sick. He did not reveal if the queen was at home or in hospital. One of the women who attended, Smangele Mbatha (60) from Ntuli Village in Nkandla, in northern KZN, said the gathering is one of the most important to them. She said women who are regarded as pillars of strength in their homes need to gather with other women and share solutions for the challenges they face from time to time. “We interpret it as a way of holding each other’s hands in the work of nation building. We also share how to raise our children so they can grow up to be responsible adults.”
