THE government has called on residents to help cops reverse the increase in child murders in Mpumalanga. Community Safety MEC Pat Ngomane and provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma made this call after a number of incidents were reported in which children disappeared and were then found dead. Zuma said: “The kidnapping and killing of children has become the norm and it must stop because it is senseless.” The latest victim was six-year-old Noluthando Masango. She was kidnapped in Siyabuswa kasi in Mpumalanga and was found dead in a river. Cops said she was raped and strangled. In May, Katlego Marite from Tasbet Park in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga was kidnapped by three men. Luckily, he was later found alive. Ngomane and Zuma called on parents to keep a close eye on their children.
