THE shock death of their beloved son and brother seems to
be behind the joint suicide of a mum and daughter in Sydney, Australia. According to news.com.au, Ashley Pouladian (20), her mum,
Sisi Pouladian (45) and the family dog were discovered dead together inside
their black hatchback on the back of their property last week. Neighbours raised the alarm after reading a “disturbing
message” stuck on their front door. Ashley had been studying at the University of Technology
Sydney to become a dentist. Varsity friend Zoe Bee told news.com.au Pouladian was
visibly shaken by the death of her brother, Pouya Pouladian (24) in March. The
aspiring pilot died unexpectedly after an operation. "She was a very beautiful, funny, young girl who had
to deal with a tough situation," said Zoe. "It would have been
horrible for anyone to have to deal with." They had also lost their husband and dad to cancer six years
ago. Ashley’s best friend Alex Opacic thinks he may be the
last to have seen her when he visited her house just hours before she and her
mum killed themselves. He didn’t know exactly what, but he could tell something
was wrong. "Ashley couldn't look me in the eyes. She couldn't
hug me properly. I felt sick in the stomach when I got home," he told Daily Mail. "I was at their house for six hours — I was the last
person to see them." Alex believes that Ashley agreed to kill herself to keep
her grieving mum company as she died. "Ashley was trying to be positive — she's such a
supportive person — and all her friends understand that she was in the car to
be with her mother," he said. A cop spokeswoman told news.com.au police was
investigating the deaths, but they aren’t thought to be suspicious.
