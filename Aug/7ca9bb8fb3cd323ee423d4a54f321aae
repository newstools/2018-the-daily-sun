Kaizer Chiefs have announced the signing of Godfrey Walusimbi from Kenyan giants Gor Mahia. The 29-year-old Ugandan left-back has penned a three-year deal with Amakhosi. Chiefs initially angered Gor officials with the manner in which they approached Walusimbi, but the respective parties managed to resolve their issues and thrash out the terms of a transfer. Amakhosi recently recruited Mario Booysen and Lebogang Manyama, adding to the recent arrivals of Khama Billiat, Letlhogonolo Mirwa, Virgil Vries and Adriamirado Andrianarimanana.
