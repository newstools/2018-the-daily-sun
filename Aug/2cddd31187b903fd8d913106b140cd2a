Kenyan club Gor Mahia have accused Kaizer Chiefs of tapping their defender‚ Godfrey Walusimbi‚ who they say has gone Awol to South Africa for a possible move without them knowing. As a result Walusimbi was not in Gor Mahia’s squad that beat Posta Rangers in a 2-1 league match at Moi Stadium in Kisumu. Kenya’s Nairobi News reported that Mahia have put a R3-million price tag on the defender. Mahia chairman Ambrose Rachier‚ however‚ has accused Chiefs of player-tappin their defender.Tapping is the process of a club attempting to sign another team’s player without seeking permission to do so. It is forbidden in Fifa’s regulations.Rachier alleged that Chiefs’ chairman Kaizer Motaung had contacted his Mahia counterpart to apologise for the manner in which the Soweto giants had approach Walusimbi.In a statement on Gor Mahia’s official website‚ Rachier said: “Let it be known that Walusimbi made it to South Africa to meet Kaizer Chiefs without the club’s permission or notifying the club on his travel intentions. It’s unfortunate that a player can just decide on his own to travel to engage another club without our knowledge."“I got an alert from someone that he was traveling and the next thing was a call from Kaizer Chiefs chairman (Motaung) apologising for that step and requesting if we could talk on a possible move.“I declined to discuss anything and told Chiefs’ chairman I will hold a meeting with my EC [executive committee] then we will know what step to take.“What Walusimbi did was wrong. Kaizer Chiefs too did something wrong because that’s player tapping‚ which is against stipulated rules yet the player has a running contract. There are clear and accepted procedures if they wanted the player.”Player tapping is covered in article 18.3 of Fifa’s Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players.The rule states: “A club intending to conclude a contract with a professional must inform the player’s current club in writing before entering into negotiations with him.”Chiefs have already been involved in one controversial matter this transfer window for Madagascan international Andriamirado “Dax” Andrianarimanana.Dax’s club‚ Fosa Juniors‚ alleged the player had a contract with them until 2020‚ which the player disputed. He has since been confirmed an Amakhosi signing and is currently waiting for his work permit to be cleared to play in the PSL.
