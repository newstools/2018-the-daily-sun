IN 2009, Morris Sithole found out he and a stranger shared an ID number. When he got the impression Home Affairs officials weren’t equipped to help him, he used the presidential hotline to report the matter in 2010. A new ID was issued after he made the call. But his nightmare was far from over. Morris from Mamelodi East, north of Tshwane, said when he went to Home Affairs’ Tzaneen branch in 2009, he was told their records indicated he had applied for a new ID in 2003. “I didn’t make that application,” said Morris. “Why would I do that when I still had my old ID?” He said after he called the presidential hotline, Home Affairs told him to bring a testimonial from his primary school and copies of his parents’ IDs. In 2011, Morris received a letter that said his new ID had a different ID number. He was told to use the new ID but refused. According to Morris, Home Affairs last year gave him his old ID and a letter of apology. “I was told the fraudster’s details were unlinked from my ID,” said Morris. He said the biggest surprise in the eight-year ordeal came in 2016. Morris said he went to apply for an RDP but was told he already owned one in Palm Ridge, Ekurhuleni. He said when he visited the housing department he was told he couldn’t apply for another RDP until he had sorted out his ID problem. Morris said he couldn’t stand the thought of the fraudster living in an RDP house while he was being sent from pillar to post. “Home Affairs has not fulfilled its promise,” he said. “They have not stopped that man from using my ID.” Morris said all he wanted was for the man to be caught and deported for all the trouble he had caused. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the case was referred to the relevant unit for investigation.
