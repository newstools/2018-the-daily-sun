IT WAS supposed to be a pleasant shopping trip to another African country with her friend. But it turned into a nightmare! After Babazile Sali (17) of Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni arrived in Tanzania with her friend, she discovered her friend wanted to sell her to a man. Babazile, who landed back in Mzansi last week after more than a year of hell, told Daily Sun: “She left me at a certain house and told me she was coming back, but then disappeared.” Babazile found herself stranded in a foreign country and with no money in March last year. The man she had been sold to wanted her to be his wife. “He told me he had paid money to my friend, but I refused.” Babazile ran away and explained her situation to people in the area. Then a stranger took her in. She did not know anyone, or where to get money to come back home. “I stayed with strangers, and even when I tried to contact my friend, her phone was off. “I regret trusting her. I went with her to her country thinking she was going to take care of me, but she sold me and returned to Mzansi alone.” Babazile tried to get people to help her get home, but they did not have the means. Then one day, somebody took her to the South African embassy and she had new hope of coming home. Arrangements were made for her to return home, and last week she landed on South African soil. She said when they left Mzansi her friend made her believe they were going to buy traditional clothing, as it was cheaper in Tanzania. “I was excited and could not wait, as she told me traditional clothes were cheaper on that side and we were going to make a good profit.” Her friend insisted on keeping her purse in her own bag. Little did she suspect that her “friend” was up to something. Police spokesman Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said Etwatwa cops had opened a case of kidnapping and were searching for the “friend”, who is believed to be back in Mzansi.
