A video of thugs stealing body lotion from a truck in Durban
has surfaced on social media. In the video, the thugs can be seen stopping a white Hyundai
H1 next to the truck. Following that they open the side of the truck and rapidly steal
several boxes from the truck. Sumtas fleet controller Sashnam Sunnylall told News24, that the
truck was carrying cosmetic products from Johannesburg. "They took about two pallets worth of lotions from the
truck in less than four minutes. At this point we're looking at around R65 000 to
R70 000 worth of goods taken," said Sunnylall. The Incident reportedly took place on Thursday.
