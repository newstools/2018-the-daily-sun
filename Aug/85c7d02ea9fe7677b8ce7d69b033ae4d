TEN people died and 30 were hurt in a bus accident at Aberdeen outside Beaufort West yesterday morning. The Naledi bus was travelling to the Eastern Cape from Cape Town. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said: “There are still people trapped under the bus. “We’re waiting for breakdown services so we can free the trapped people.” The bus was travelling in the direction of Beaufort West when the driver lost control at about 2:15am. “We’re not sure if driver fatigue could have played a role,” said Africa. Western Cape Health spokesman Robert Daniels said the injured were taken to the Beaufort West Hospital. “Ten people died and 30 others were injured when a bus overturned on the R62, about 25km outside Beaufort West,” said Daniels. Rescue staff had continued pulling trapped patients from the wreckage. Western Cape transport spokesman Nceba Hinana said: “We convey a message of support to the families that lost their loved ones in the accident and wish a speedy recovery to those who’ve been injured.” Since this was not a head-on collision, he said, the driver could have been sleeping or was tired. “It comes down to what we’ve been talking about: that long-distance bus drivers, and even taxi drivers, should always have alternative drivers,” said Hinana. Bus company spokesman Thabang Mateka said a kudu reportedly jumped across the road and caused the crash.
