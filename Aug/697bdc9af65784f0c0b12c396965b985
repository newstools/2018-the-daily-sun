THEIR journey was cut short when they were robbed of cash. Kgotso Segoe (54) and Seunkie Shopane (34) from Boshof, Free State were robbed at a local filling station on Monday. They were on their way to a farm in Hertzogville to buy potatoes, which they sell for a living. Kgotso said they decided to stop at the filling station to fill up with petrol. “We refuelled my bakkie without even dreaming of being robbed. “We decided to take a nap before proceeding on our journey,” said Kgotso. He said the incident was like a bad dream. “When I opened my eyes, my friend was being dragged out of the car and shouting for help. “He was beaten with a hammer and the back of a gun,” he said. Kgotso said he tried to help him but the thugs pointed a gun at him. “I felt helpless. “They searched me and took my jacket, which had my cellphones and R600 in cash. “I regret not listening to my instincts because we wouldn’t have been robbed,” he said. “I prayed for them not to kill us. Luckily, they just took our valuables and left.” Kgotso said he was grateful to still be alive. “I hope they are arrested,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said: “We confirm a case of common robbery was opened and investigations continue.”
