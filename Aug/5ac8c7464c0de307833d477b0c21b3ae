AN administration block at Chief Henry Bokleni Senior Secondary School was gutted by flames on Wednesday night. The fire was the second in two years at the school in Libode, Eastern Cape. School computers, printers and everything in the principal and deputy principal’s offices were destroyed. In 2016, the school was one of three that was torched by pupils protesting against a shortage of teachers and demanding a matric farewell function. Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said: “We learnt with shame that the school’s administration block was burned down on Wednesday night. “The principal was informed by the SGB leader that the school was on fire. “The principal arrived at the school before the fire brigade was called and found everything in his office, his deputy’s office, and the staff room had been burned.” The motive hadn’t yet been established. “The matter has been reported to police as there’s strong evidence of arson. “I appeal to anyone with information to help the police with their investigation. “The attack is disappointing and discouraging, but the department has sent officials to assess the damage and develop an urgent intervention to ensure teaching and learning is not compromised. “The district director is scheduled to talk to the school community, including pupils and SGB members.” The school was still recovering from the first arson attack when the second hit. “We have a new prefab structure and pupils have not even moved into their new classrooms yet because we’re busy wiring the electricity,” he said. Mtima appealed to parents, teachers and residents to remain calm and to allow cops to finish their investigation.
