THE Nkosi and Mokgata families are worried about their dead loved ones. Albert Mahlangu, who died in 1999 aged 78, has apparently been buried in the wrong grave. His son Godfrey Nkosi (53) from Mamelodi West in Tshwane said he and his two siblings were unemployed and blame it on the grave. “I believe my dad is angry and has turned against us. We’ve been looking for jobs without success,” said Godfrey. Godfrey said had Albert wanted to be buried in the same grave as his wife Gertrude, who died in 1990. But Albert is buried on top of Daniel Mokgata. Godfrey said when he visited the graveyard, a woman told him it was her father’s grave that he was cleaning. He said when they buried their father it was the only open grave and they thought it was where their mum was buried. “My mother is buried in the next grave,” he said. “We blame the municipality for all the problems.” Jane Mokgata (55) said her dad Daniel died many years ago. “We discovered in 2008 that another man was buried on top of my father.” Jane said she saved up for a tombstone but couldn’t erect it. “My grandchild is having nightmares. He often says my dad visits him in his dreams, telling him he’s not at peace.” Lindela Mashigo, a spokesman for the City of Tshwane, said a team from parks and cemeteries had met Godfrey. “He has been advised to go to Home Affairs to get details of the burial,” said Mashigo.
