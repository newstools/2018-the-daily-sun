WEZIWE Tikana said women police officers are capable of carrying out their duties just like men. The Eastern Cape Safety MEC was speaking in Mthatha yesterday at the launch of a five-year plan to address empowering women in the police service. Tikana said women officers were better at breaking up incidents of public violence than men. “Women are becoming a force to be reckoned with in law enforcement but are not recognised. Today, women are in law enforcement roles but the challenges are massive,” she said. The MEC challenged women to support one another. “Those in positions of power must know that whatever they do, they represent other women. We must not fail as young women are looking up to us,” she said. Lieutenant-General Bongiwe Zulu said the five-year plan would provide women with the skills they needed to succeed. At the event, Eastern Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga signed a pledge to continue working hard to serve the public.
