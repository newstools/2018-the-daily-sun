A NEW song is making the rounds in SunLand. However, the song is exclusively for children who receive grants from the South African Social Security Agency. And while it is a strong and catchy tune sung by sweet voices, the message hits home hard. The song calls on parents to stop spending the kids’ grant money on cellphones, clothes and fancy hairstyles. A video of a group of young boys and girls singing the song has gone viral. The song was performed at what looks like a creche ceremony and parents are heard applauding while the kids belted out the tune. The kids also sang about how some mums use their social grant payments to get their nails done. Pinky Mofokeng, principal of a creche in Sebokeng, Vaal said the songaims to inform kids what their money should be used for. “Although the ones who appeared in the video are not from my creche, we teach this song to our pupils as well. “The information we pass on to the kids helps their parents make proper decisions about how their grant money should be spent,” she said. A teacher at a creche in Sharpeville said she also taught the song to the little ones in her care. “When kids sing this song, it’s a reminder to their parents to make wise financial decisions instead of pampering themselves with their children’s money,” said the teacher. Sassa spokesman Kgomoco Diseko said: “The video illustrates the experience in a number of households. “Caregivers are supposed to use a grant to meet kids’ needs, not spend it on luxuries. “In cases where there is grant abuse, the public can report the matter to a social worker so that appropriate action can be taken once an investigation is conducted,” Diseko said.
