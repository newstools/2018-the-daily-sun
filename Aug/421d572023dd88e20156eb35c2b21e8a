WHEN he is on the pitch, Matsatsantsa a Pitorimidfielder Reneilwe “Yeye” Letsholonyane guides his teammates to score goals. The SuperSport United player will need those skills when he joins the Rhulani Mabasa Children’s Foundation for a fun day on Thursday. Yeye is hosting his third annual fun day in Meadowlands, Soweto, at the RMCF Sports Complex, which was previously a dump site. The foundation is based in Meadowlands zone 3, Soweto, which is Yeye’s kasi. It is aimed at developing community public spaces into a safe and clean environment. The foundation also hosts various programmes dedicated to the upliftment of children by education and sport. In recognition of Mzansi’s rising population and lack of information for poor children, the foundation helps communities by facilitating and initiating educational programmes to bring knowledge to children, particularly those in rural communities. Yeye said off the pitch he was all about giving back to the community he grew up in. He also sees no better way to do that than by being involved in programmes that uplift the youth. Soccer teams have been asked to be part of the fun day. The entry fee is R500 a team. Vendors are also advised to book stalls at R350 for the day to provide refreshments for attendees.
