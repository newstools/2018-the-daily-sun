WHEN their transport failed to arrive in Joburg after they had finished a trip yesterday, some students from Azaadville, Krugersdorp decided to adopt Plan B to get home, resulting in tragedy and trauma. Plan B backfired and left one of the students dead and the others robbed of their valuables by thugs who escaped. Police are looking for any information that might help them find the suspects. The seven students had been on a visit to Kruger National Park. They waited in vain at Joburg’s Park Station for their transport, and then hired a taxi to take them home. What they did not know was that those they hired were not real taxi men, but robbers. The students were shocked when the two suspects demanded their valuables at gunpoint. It is not clear what led to one of them being shot, but the thugs managed to rob the others of their valuables. Gauteng SAPS provincial spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele told Daily Sun the police were investigating a case of murder and armed robbery. “We are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident,” said Makhubela. He said the cops were looking for the two suspects who shot and killed the one student and robbed the others.
