TheSE parents want to know why their daughter’s suspected killer is roaming the streets. The family from Violet Bank, Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga said their daughter, Sharlotte Nyalungu, was murdered last Sunday. The 32-year-old went to celebrate an ingoma ceremony in the village together with her younger sister. Her sister, Koki Nyalungu (18), told Daily Sun that they were heading home after the ceremony when Sharlotte’s lover came and took her away. “I carried on walking home but soon I heard a gunshot,” Koki said. “Then her boyfriend phoned me and said Sharlotte had been shot by two young men. He said I should go to the scene.” Koki said she rushed home to call her family. Sharlotte’s mum, Elizabeth Pule (52), said they went to the scene and found her daughter lying dead in a pool of blood. “Then Sharlotte’s lover jumped out of the bushes near the scene. He was hiding in the bush. He should have protected my child. He should have screamed or something,” she said. Elizabeth said they suspected that he shot Sharlotte. The police raided the man’s home and found stolen cellphones but they didn’t find the gun. Angry residents have vowed to teach the man a lesson. Captain Ndlovukazi Mashele said the man was arrested after police raided his home. He is out on R1 000 bail. He faces charges of possession of suspected stolen items.
