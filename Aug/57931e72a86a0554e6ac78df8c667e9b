MZANSI has lost another legendary radio presenter. Former Motsweding FM radio presenter Keegeletse Tabile passed away last Thursday at the age of 60. His brother, Gadaffi Tabile, confirmed to Daily Sun that KP, as Keegeletse was better known, died of a heart attack at Klerksdorp Hospital in North West. At the time of his death he was a freelancer and a contributor to Radio Sport. Tabile was a legendary news and sports commentator. One of his former colleagues, Oatile Jacobs, posted on Facebook: “He is the man who brought me to Motsweding FM. Not only me, but most of the talented on-air personalities. “He had an ear for talent. Most of his recruits are household names as they are all doing well.” Another colleague, Letlhogonolo Moseki, described KP as an all- rounder who worked as a news anchor, as well as a cricket and soccer commentator. Safa national executive member Monde Motshiwa said: “The SABC had an asset in you. Your footprints are left in icons such as Oshebeng Koonyaditse. “You had your time and you used it greatly. You developed great men. “I will miss above all your humbleness, assertiveness and openness.” KP leaves behind his wife, three daughters, two grandsons and four siblings. He will be buried in Meirings-park, Klerksdorp, on Saturday.
