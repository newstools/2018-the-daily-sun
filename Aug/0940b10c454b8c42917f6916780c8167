LAST Monday hostel dwellers demonstrated outside the Pikitup depot, demanding jobs. When nothing was done, however, residents of the hostel in Diepkloof, Soweto, returned to the local depot on Thursday and blocked the entrance with burning tyres and rocks. However, they did not get what they wanted and on Friday they turned up the heat by destroying two trucks belonging to Pikitup. One truck was set alight, while the other was stoned. The protesters told Daily Sun what they had done so far was nothing compared to what they would do if no one listened to them. Nancefield resident Sandile Mhlongo said: “Next we will burn down all the depots in Soweto and everyone will be unemployed. Maybe if they are on our level, they will feel our pain.” Mlungisi Mdunge from Mzimhlophe Hostel said all they wanted was to be hired, but they didn’t have R7 000 to pay a bribe for a job. They claimed Pikitup hired people recently, but none of them was from a hostel. Hostel representative Mxolisi Thusini claimed Pikitup had gone to Eastern Cape to find workers. “Those people paid a bribe of R7 000 and that is why we couldn’t get the jobs even though we are from the area.” Mxolisi said an investigation needed to be done to prove their claims. Lindokuhle Mhlungu, a resident of Dube Hostel, said: “We are living like animals in the hostels. It’s filthy, but we know we can change that if we are given jobs.” Pikitup spokesman Muzi Mkhwanazi condemned the actions of the dwellers. “We are hoping the police will arrest all those responsible for the damage.” He said the company met with the Joburg Metro Police to ask for help in protecting employees and property.
