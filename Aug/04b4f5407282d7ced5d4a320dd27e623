OTHER residents aren’t affected by the weather forecast, but the Xulus from Entumeni Village in Eshowe, northern KZN, pray for calm weather every day. This family of seven share a rondavel that is falling apart. They fear that bad weather might cause it to collapse and leave them homeless, or even dead. Nompumelelo Mpanza (28) said during heavy rain they fear water will cause the walls to cave in. “We live with our old gogo (84), whose health is not good. “My three siblings and I are unemployed and my two small kids are still at school. “We rely on our gogo’s pension money for basic needs like groceries.” She said for many years the family had owned five rondavels, but four of them collapsed last year during heavy rain. “We couldn’t rebuild them because we don’t have any money.” She said the rondavel that remained intact was their only shelter. They use it as a kitchen to cook meals and as a bathroom. She said the ward councillor was aware of their living conditions but had made a hurtful remark. “My gogo sent a neighbour to speak to the ward councillor about our situation a short while after the heavy rains, but all he said was that we needed to use our hands to build another mud house,” said Nompumelelo. She pleaded with Good Samaritans to lend a helping hand. Councillor Vusumuzi Chamane told the People’s Paper: “I don’t remember saying any hurtful words to that family about the situation they’re going through. “But I’m aware of their plight and working on compiling a report specifying that this family needs urgent assistance.”
