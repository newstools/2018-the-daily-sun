HE OPERATES a scrapyard in his neighbourhood. But the scrapyard owner is a nightmare for his neighbours. That’s because they allegedly keep finding their stolen things at his place. Now neighbours from Tsakane in Ekurhuleni want the scrapyard to be closed down. Two neighbours recently found their belongings there. Jabu Mfundisi’s steel gate was stolen two weeks ago. He said when he investigated, he found it at his neighbour’s scrapyard. “The gate had already been chopped up and was ready to be sold as scrap metal. “I told the scrapyard owner to replace the gate or face jail. He bought the material and sent a welder to reinstall the gate at my house.” Another neighbour, Dira Phahlane found his palisade fence missing when he came back from work last Friday. He searched for it but couldn’t find it. On Sunday his wife Thembi noticed it lying in the ash as she was driving past the scrapyard.She rushed home to tell Dira. “We want the scrapyard owner to replace our fence,” said Dira. Scrapyard owner James Kgwadi said: “I buy things from people but I don’t ask them where they got the scrap from.”
