A leap of faith in business has paid off big time for the Khomo family in John Taolo Gaetsewe municipality in the Northern Cape. Theirs is the success story of real empowerment in South Africa's mining industry. Just two years ago, Jomo Khomo and his wife Kefilwe, identified an opportunity for mining solutions. Their experiences living abroad, and seeing how this was possible in a country like Canada inspired them to do the same here in South Africa.  Kele Mining Services was born and today, the 100% black owned and operated company has become successful  through contract mining. Khomo told Day Sun that business was hard in the beginning until they started working with Anglo American's iron ore business, Kumba Iron Ore. Since this intervention by Kumba Iron Ore the company  has over 3000% revenue increase a year. Khomo said Kumba was looking for local businesses to provide services and supply products. "Through Kumba’s supplier development programme, we learnt how to run business operations, how to market ourselves and other business principles. “We grew from there and managed to secure other opportunities within Kumba and other mining companies," he said. The company is always looking at opportunities to improve safety and productivity to help South Africa’s mining industry become globally competitive. “We believe we’ve changed the lives of many people here,” he said. Khomo said that their partnership with Kumba has inspired them to empower smaller businesses as well. “We give local businesses contracts and help them so they have the skills we need. We provide them with equipment and knowledge so they are able to compete.” They have also secured opportunities in Rustenburg in the platinum mining sector and are exploring opportunities in Botswana.
