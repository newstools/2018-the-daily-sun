DAYLIGHT robberies are becoming a norm in Joburg. Another video has surfaced on social media showing a man being mugged in a very busy street in Joburg. The man was robbed in broad daylight by a group of men in the Small Street retail centre. The man could be seen being choked and robbed of his valuables while no one shows no interest in helping him. He tries to fight them off, but they succeeded in pinning him to the ground and taking his valuables.
