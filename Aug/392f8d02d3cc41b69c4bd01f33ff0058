FRIENDS and fellow artists will remember the late DJ Sir Bubzin at a memorial service tomorrow. Sir Bubzin’s brother, Khulani Cele (42), said the service will be held at Ethekwini Community Church in Durban, KZN. Sir Bubzin (37), whose real name was Bongani Cele, died on Friday after spending a month at King Edward VIII Hospital in Durban. Khulani said: “My brother was diagnosed with leukaemia. We only found out he was suffering from the disease when he was in hospital last month. But we didn’t know it would claim his life so quickly.” Khulani said fellow artists have promised to give Sir Bubzin a dignified funeral. “We have received so much support from the KZN government and the artists who have worked with my brother.” Khulani said his brother left behind three kids aged two, eight and 12. “He will be buried at his homestead in KwaDukuza on Sunday.” KZN ANC spokesman Mdumiseni Ntuli said: “Sir Bubzin will be remembered for his talent and for producing quality music for other artists.”
