WHEN sick Christian Selwana (56) started receiving his grant money, life felt bearable. But his relief lasted only a short time because after just five months, his grant was stopped. The poor man from Waverley in Tshwane said this had resulted in him struggling to put food on the table for his family. He said he hadn’t had a grant since May this year. “I’m not happy with Sassa because they have stopped paying me without any explanation,” he said. The madala told Daily Sun that he visited Sassa’s offices in Mahube, Mamelodi East, many times but was constantly being sent from pillar to post. Sassa spokeswoman Nandi Mosia said the grant was approved for a period of six months, from November to April. She said the madala should visit his nearest Sassa office for an application if he feels his medical condition hadn’t improved.
