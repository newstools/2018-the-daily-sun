POLOKWANE City coach Josef Vukusic is apparently skating on thin ice. SunSport has reliably learnt that the Slovakian mentor will be shown the door if Rise and Shine do not beat neighbours Baroka FC on Saturday (3pm). The teams will battle it out in an Absa Premiership Limpopo derby at Peter Mokaba Stadium. City have lost their first two league matches, recording a 1-0 defeat to PSL newcomers Black Leopards followed by a 2-0 defeat to champions Mamelodi Sundows last week. City, who avoided relegation in their last league game last season, are currently bottom of the standings without a point, along with Maritzburg United and Chippa United. Said the source: “The management are worried that the club hasn’t shown progress since Vukusic took over from Bernard Molekwa. They don’t want to see the club in a similar situation to last season and that’s why they want results early on.” However, Vukusic says he is not panicking, as he is confident City will soon turn the corner. The 53-year-old joined Rise and Shine two months ago. Molekwa is now his deputy. “I am happy with the performance in our two matches,” said Vukusic. “We played two very different teams, Leopards and the PSL champions, and I was particularly happy with the performance against Sundowns. We had two big chances and we could not score. But I am sure if we continue with this form results will come sooner or later. I am positive about this team.” He added: “I fielded some youngsters who did well even though it is their first season in the PSL. The problem is that we did not score in either game, but we will work on it.”
