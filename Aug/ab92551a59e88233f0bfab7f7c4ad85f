A FAMILY  from Ntabezibomvu in Nquthu, northern KZN, said they are counting on the police to find the people who killed three of their relatives on Saturday. Nhlakanipho Msomi (25), Muzi Zulu (25) and neighbour Simphiwe Dlamini (30) were shot in public while Philani Mabaso (32) and gogo Busisiwe Mabaso (69) were shot at home. Philani was declared dead on arrival in hospital. The gogo is recovering at home after being discharged on Monday. According to family member Mbali Mabaso (54), Nhlakanipho, Muzi and Simphiwe were supposed to fetch a hired tent when the chaos broke out. She said the three had only been away for a short time when their relatives saw their car driving into the yard. “We didn’t pay much attention to them because we thought they had come to fetch the tent. “We were all shocked when we suddenly heard gunshots being fired at Philani’s house. “My mum rushed out to see what was happening, and that’s when she was shot,” said Mbali. She said the gunmen fled on foot, leaving their car parked in the yard. Mbali said they called neighbours to help them rush Philani and her mum to hospital. On their way to hospital, they saw a large crowd gathering around people who were lying on the side of the road. Mbali later found out the crowd had circled around three people who had also been shot. “We pray the cops find the culprits. What they did to us is painful. “We don’t know why this happened because as far as we know, we don’t have any enemies in this neighbourhood,” said Mbali. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the shooting. “Task teams are on the hunt for those responsible for the murders,” Zwane told Daily Sun. “We appeal to anyone who has information regarding the culprits’ whereabouts or identity to contact their local police station or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.”
