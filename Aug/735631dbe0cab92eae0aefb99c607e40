VENDORS operating at Morebeng taxi rank outside Polokwane have reason to smile. This is because the burst pipe that had caused flooding and a foul smell in the rank has been fixed. The vendors say they had been reporting the damaged pipe to Molemole Municipality for eight years with no luck. But after the People’s Paper ran the story recently, the pipe was quickly fixed. The vendors believe their businesses will now run smoothly. One of the trader, Piet Motshosi, said their businesses had been affected badly and they would sometimes go home without a cent in their pockets. “We are relieved that the pipe has been fixed,” said Piet. He said they had to travel long distances to fetch water as the taps at the rank had run dry. “We rely on the money we make from our small businesses to put food on the table. When the municipality failed to deal with the burst pipe, we were left stranded. We had nothing to feed our families. “People could no longer support our businesses because they feared for their health,” he said. Charles Moroleng said they suffered during that period. “I’m grateful that today I can wake up like other people knowing that I will come back with something for my family,” he said. “We depend on these businesses and we can’t sit and watch them sink.” Molemole mayor Edward Paya said they understand that such bed smells could negatively affect people’s businesses. “Reporting such matters in time will assist us to send out our teams to attend to these matters before anything gets damaged,” said Paya. “We urge all our residents not ignore damaged municipal properties but to report them in good time.”
