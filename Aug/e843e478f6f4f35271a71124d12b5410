YESTERDAY Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtshweni visited people in KaNyamazane, door-to-door. She was visiting residents affected by a hailstorm in May. This comes after violent week-long protests in the area as residents barricaded roads. They demanded that President Cyril Ramaphosa address them after provincial government failed to speed up the fixing of their houses. Last Wednesday Mtshweni was chased away when she tried to speak to the people. She said she had since spoken to the residents and had heard their cries. “We have been asked to give our officials an opportunity to speak to residents. They will then give us a date on which to hold a community meeting. “We are here to do an inspection of the work already done in the area. “We will keep on inspecting and speed up the work, adding to the number of contractors to do so. “We admit we have not touched all the houses affected in the area.” Mtshweni said contractors were expected to finish with the top structures within three weeks. Gogo Sibongile Mkhw- anati said she was excited about the premier’s visit because they had been trying to speak to her, and she now believed there would be progress.
