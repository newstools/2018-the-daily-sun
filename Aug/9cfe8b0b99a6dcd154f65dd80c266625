KEDIBONE Ngobeni says she’s lost out on many job opportunities because she has no ID. The 28-year-old from extension 18 in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, was born at Mokopane Hospital in Limpopo but she says Home Affairs won’t believe her. The worried mum said her problems were also now affecting her three-year-old son. Kedibone said she had never had an ID. She said she visited Home Affairs in Mamelodi East several times and was told to bring her mum’s ID and a letter from her school. She submitted the documents. Kedibone said she was also struggling to register her son for a grant as her child’s father died last year. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said they would contact Kedibone to finalise the matter.
