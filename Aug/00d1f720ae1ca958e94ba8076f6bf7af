KHAYELITSHA residents who are gatvol of crime in their area marched in Cape Town yesterday. Khayelitsha Development Forum, Sanco, Cosas and several pupils handed over a memorandum of concerns to Western Cape Premier Helen Zille. Provincial Cosas chairman Mphumzi Giwa said: “Pupils are being threatened by thugs who walk in and out of schools with no proper security. Teachers are being robbed by gun-wielding thugs.” Sanco leader Zonisele Bozo said: “Kids in rich, predominantly white areas do not struggle with security, yet Khayelitsha and other townships are neglected. We want this issue to be fixed. The education department has until Monday to send security to our schools or else we will take the matter further.” Khayelitsha residents said they tried to negotiate with Community Safety MEC Dan Plato and Education MEC Debbie Schafer, but nothing had changed. Nomasebe Gugile (45), a parent, said: “My niece is afraid of going to school because someone was shot in front of her.” Zille wanted to respond to the residents, but they refused to give her a loudspeaker and prevented her from responding to any of the issues raised in the memorandum. Sanco leader Bonginkosi Qhama said: “We are not going to give you a chance to respond now. You will respond to our memorandum in seven days.”
