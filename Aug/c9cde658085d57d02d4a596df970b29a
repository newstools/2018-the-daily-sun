The University of KwaZulu-Natal has suspended lectures at its Westville campus in Durban following violent clashes between police and students. "A group of students embarked on protest action on the campus today. The protesters disrupted lectures and caused damage to property, including security vehicles," university spokesperson Normah Zondo said on Wednesday. According to Zondo, the university's risk management services and police dispersed the protesters. She said one security staff member "was injured in the fracas" and that a change room and toilet were set alight. The protest comes after students raised issues regarding amenities in some residence, National Student Financial Aid Scheme administration, shuttle services timetables and other matters. Zondo said the academic programme at the campus would resume on Monday, August 13. "The suspension period will allow time for university management to engage with student leadership to resolve student matters." Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident and said no arrests had been made.
