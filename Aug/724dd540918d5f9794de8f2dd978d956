RABIE Ridge, Kanana, Phomolong and Mayibuye in Ekurhuleni have a reputation for being the highest drug producers. In an operation by police at the weekend, a total of 15kg of nyaope, kat and dagga was confiscated in these four kasis. Captain Mofana Mafela told Daily Sun they found the drugs through a stop and search operation, following information from police informants. Mafela said the police also asked anyone who could help to rehabilitate drug addicts to come forward. “We asked a chef in Midrand to train the youth and the response was positive,” he said. “These young people are now chefs in various companies around South Africa. “Some have visited the US, while others are employed in Dubai. All these young people were adopted by the Rabie Ridge Police Station.” Mafela is confident that young people could make something of their lives and crime reduced in the area if other sponsors came forward.
