SEEING a patient suffer or dying is traumatic and might lead to depression. For this reason Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital in Mthatha, Eastern Cape held a prayer service on Wednesday to help nurses and doctors cope with the trauma that comes with caring for patients. The hospital’s labour relations manager, Thembisa Jubase, said most of the time, workers were surrounded by death. “Not much attention is given to health professionals when a person dies in their hands. They get frustrated and become angry with themselves for not helping the patient stay alive,” said Jubase. She said families sometimes harass hospital staff when a loved one dies and blame them for the death. “This makes things worse because our members then lose focus.” Nurse Zovuyo Kheswa said the service gave them hope and showed that their hard work was being recognised. “We are faced with a lot of challenges because we work with people’s lives. “Working under pressure is not easy, but we appreciate the fact that our employer recognises the challenges we face, “Sometimes patients shout at us but we have to understand and not fight them.” Eastern Cape Health spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha encouraged hospitals to organise similar programmes. “Our employees play a crucial role in the lives of our people, but at times this is challenging, so they need such healing programmes,” he said.
