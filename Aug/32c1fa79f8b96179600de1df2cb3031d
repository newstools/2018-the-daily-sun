It's hardly been a week since US rapper Kanye West trended for wearing small slides to 2 Chains' wedding and those slides are still making headlines today. Kanye recently posted another picture of what appears to be lage Yeezy Slippers. The slipper design is of that of the Yeezy Boost 350. It is still unclear if the rapper designed these and if they will be on the market.  Resembling a pair of complimentary slippers that you might get at your local pool or fitness club, the Yeezy Slides have provoked a wave of mockery and hilarious memes on twitter since the first images were released.
