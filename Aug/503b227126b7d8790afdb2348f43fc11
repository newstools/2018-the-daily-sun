A COP (56) died after the bakkie he was travelling in collided with another bakkie carrying a coffin. The Toyota Fortuner, which was pulling a trailer with a coffin, was hit by the police bakkie on the N8 near Tweespruit in the Free State on Friday afternoon. Twelve people travelling in the Fortuner were injured and the coffin lid was damaged. The bakkie from Diepsloot Funerals was transporting a body to Lesotho when the accident happened. Diepsloot Funeral secretary Tinos Manzunzu told Daily Sun: “We asked a private helper from the Free State to help us deliver the body to Lesotho, where it was scheduled for burial on Sunday. “None of our passengers died in the accident.” Manzunzu said the body was not damaged. Police spokesman Sergeant Martin Xuma urged motorists to be vigilant, especially on main roads. “The Makwane police bakkie had three members inside at the time of the accident,” said the cops spokesman. “The members were coming from Bloemfontein and heading to Makwane Village in Phuthaditjhaba, Free State.” Xuma said the Toyota Fortuner pulling the trailer was coming from Diepsloot kasi in Gauteng and heading towards Lesotho. He said a case of culpable homicide was being investigated by Tweespruit police.
