ALL hell broke loose at a clinic after a man who had been
admitted feeling sick mysteriously ended up dead in a swamp. According to Daily
Monitor, family members of Ivan Tumukunde (32) were so outraged by his
unexplained death and his body ending up in a swamp that they marched on the
clinic, intending to lynch the staff. Ivan was taken by a relative to Fellowship Medical Centre
in Matugga Town council, Wakiso in southern Uganda on Wednesday. But by Thursday he was deceased and his fully clothed
body lying in the Kaguja swamp. Cop spokesman Luke Owoyesigyire said: “The deceased was
taken to the clinic by a relative because he was not feeling well. They left
him there but they were shocked to receive information that he was lying dead
in a swamp. We have arrested two people to help us understand how Tumukunde
left their clinic to go and die in a swamp.” Cops say the state of Ivan’s body leads them to believe
that he died in the clinic still dressed in his clothes. Nurses then allegedly
took his dead body and dumped it in the swamp. Luckily, cops managed to intercept the furious crowd as
they descended on the clinic. It has been cordoned off while cops investigate and hunt
the three other staff members – including the owner of the clinic – who have
gone on the run.
