EVERY day, Nhlanhla Mgana is tortured by the messages on her kitchen wall. The messages are a constant reminder that her marriage is in serious trouble. THIS IS BECAUSE WHENEVER SHE TRIES TO TALK TO HER HUSBAND AMON, HE REPLIES BY WRITING ON THE WALL! The 48-year-old from Kenilworth, Joburg, told Daily Sun that for three long years Amon had been giving her the silent treatment. “I applied for a protection order against my husband because he threatened to beat me. This is why he won’t talk to me anymore,” she claimed. Nhlanhla alleged her nightmare started when her cheating husband started bringing prostitutes to her home and slept with them while she was there. She said when she complained, he got angry and wrote messages to her on the wall. One of the messages says Nhlanhla must stop trying to police him because she’s not his god. She said she believed he was writing the messages to force her out of their home. Nhlanhla said she tried to involve social workers and priests, but nothing helped. “My husband does as he pleases and he has started sleeping out,” she said. “He tells me I must leave this house, but we married in community of property. “I don’t know what got into my husband. I wish he could be the man I first fell in love with.” She claimed her husband also abused her emotionally. “He chose to sleep with other people instead of me. When we have problems, we can’t sit down as a couple and solve them,” she said. Amon said he was angry that his wife had applied for a protection order, and that was why he had been writing on the wall. “I can kick her out of that house at any time. She came wearing a red panty and she brought nothing else to that house. Only her signature is on the papers for the house.”
