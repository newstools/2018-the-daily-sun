THE bitter cold was biting and the Masina family had an imbawula outside where they warmed themselves. When the flames died down they thought it was safe to take the imbawula inside their RDP house. But the silent smoke rising slowly lulled all seven of them into a deadly sleep from which only four woke up. Life had already slipped away from three members of the Masina family when they were found. The sad tragedy happened in their RDP house in Khayelitsha last Wednesday. Zoleka Jidane (42), who runs a creche down the street, told the People’s Paper that after she had knocked at the family’s door several times without getting a response, she suspected something was wrong and broke the door down. “I found three kids lying helpless on the couch. They couldn’t speak properly,” said Zoleka. She proceeded to the bedroom. “The father tried to wake up when I opened the door, but he couldn’t. The mother was on her back with bubbles coming from her mouth. That’s when I realised something was wrong. “I rushed to tell teachers and parents at the creche to get help,” said Jidane. Mum Noncedile Masina (43), her daughter Sisipho (17) and her daughter’s friend Simamkele Madyungu (16), who was visiting from Langa, all died. Jidane managed to save the lives of Nosiphe (19), Sicelo (17), Ayakha (13) and their father, Mzulungile Masina (54). They were taken to Khayelitsha District Hospital. The family is calling for help to bury those who died. Western Cape police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said an inquest case was opened.
