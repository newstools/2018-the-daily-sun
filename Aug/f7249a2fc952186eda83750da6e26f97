SELINA Mokoena (43) has accused the local councillor of wanting her husband. The 43-year from Small Farms, Vaal, claimed the councillor took her photo to a sangoma so the traditional healer could make her disappear. But the sangoma wanted nothing to do with the evil plan. “I told her I was not going to do it because I do not wreck homes. My job is to heal. I was not taught how to be a witch,” said sangoma Mafelendleni. The sangoma said she returned the photo to Selina. However, Selina still wants to expose councillor Nomvula Radebe. “I thought she was our friend, but all she wanted was my husband. “She wanted him so much that she gave him money,” said Selina. She claimed the councillor had also sent her taunting SMSes. “She is a home wrecker who boasts a lot because she has money.” Daily Sun spoke to councillor Radebe, who admitted knowing Selina. “Selina’s husband is old enough to decide what he wants. I don’t want to entertain this. “Selina must get a life.” Mohau Mokoena, Selina’s husband, said: “What does my love life have to do with your newspaper? “If you are bored, go look for stories somewhere else.”
