Local rapper Nasty C is a proud record label owner. At the age of 21, the King hit-maker  has achieved quite a lot. He already has two solid albums under his belt, Bad Hair, released under Mabala Noise, and the latest, Strings and Bling, released under Universal Music Group. He is also one of a few Mzansi rappers who are internationally renowned. He has collaborated with international stars such as ASAP FERG and French Montana. Nasty C's first artist under his new label, Tall Racks Records, is Cape Town born singer Rowlene, with whom he has worked on both his albums. “Proud to announce I’m a record label owner,” the rapper shared on social media. While he is still signed under Universal Music Group, starting a record label means Nasty C is a step closer to being his own boss. He joins the likes of Cassper Nyovest, Kwesta, AKA and Stogie T as some of the local rappers who have their own labels. PROUD TO ANNOUNCE IM A RECORD LABEL OWNER.
