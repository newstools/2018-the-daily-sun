All roads lead to the GOG Spring Explosion this Saturday. Daily Sun has partnered with GOG Gardens to celebrate spring day in Protea Glen, Soweto. People will enjoy everything the park has to offer – from swimming picnic spots and beer gardens, to food stalls, horse-riding, music and dance. Soweto-based a capella trio Urban Recite will entertain the crowd with their jazzy, soulful music. Group member Leroy Tserema said: “Our music is unique and influenced by things we see on TV and read in newspapers. “So people must expect fresh and fun performances. “We’re expecting a huge crowd and it’s going to be a beautiful show.” Born to Move Kids will do different dance routines – Zulu dance, hip hop and sbujwa. At a cost of R200, lucky visitors in fours will get an aerial view of Soweto during a helicopter ride. Fly SA Wise director Wisemen Ntombela told SunBuzz: “A number of people who stay in Soweto haven’t seen the whole of the kasi, so we’re granting them that opportunity. “From the helicopter, you’ll be able to see different places of interest. “People who’ll come between 10am and 11am will pay half price for the ride.” There will also be entertainment for kids. People should dress down for the warmth that comes with spring and have costumes, beach towels, picnic blankets and hats ready.
