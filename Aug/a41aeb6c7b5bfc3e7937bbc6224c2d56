FORGET about taxis taking you to your destination. Taxi owners, drivers and other role players in the industry are planning to park in parliament! They recently met at Mew Way Hall, Khayelitsha in Cape Town to talk about launching a political party. “We are sick and tired of people taking decisions for us. We want to be there when they talk about us,” said co-ordinator Mzoxolo Dibela. He said since government failed to solve their problems they believed that if they had members in parliament things would be much better. “Our people will represent us through a political party we will start and come back with solid information because we don’t get the information that we want,” said Dibela. He added that they feel discriminated against by government because buses and trains got better treatment than them. Dibela said they are busy registering their political party. “We named our political party All African Alliances (AAA) but we will change the name if it already exists,” he said. Dibela explained that Quantum taxis’ monthly instalments were costly and that government didn’t want to subsidise them. “We are going to communities, church members and passengers for votes,” he said. Asked if the party would also curb rampant taxi violence, he replied: “The political party will bring us together. “We will all be under one umbrella and with that we will be able to solve our differences with the help of our members in parliament.” All taxi associations were present at the meeting. But commuter Thumeka Sangani (37) was not convinced. She said she was afraid of such a political party because members of the taxi industry were usually violent.
