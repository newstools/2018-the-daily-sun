GOGO Cabangile Ngcobo said she will never forget the humiliation of being beaten with a stick by a 19-year-old girl. The 69-year-old from Hlabisa in KZN said the trouble started after she had been robbed of her cold drink. A 30-second video that has gone viral since first appearing on Ukhozi FM’s Facebook page on Tuesday, shows the teenager beating the gogo and shouting in Zulu: “Who is a bitch? Am I bitching around with you?” Gogo Cabangile said: “I was coming back from a local spaza when two schoolboys who were with the young girl took my cold drink from me.” She said she spoke to the girl because she is her neighbour. She said she called the girl a bitch because she was angry about being disrespected. “They walked away, but later that day the girl approached me. She started pushing me around and asked me why I called her a bitch, and hit me. There was nobody besides her friends who could help me. That is why I walked away.” Gogo Cabangile suffered bruises and she is going to the clinic for treatment. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that a young woman was arrested on Wednesday. “Ezibayeni cops opened a case of assault. She will appear in court soon,” he said.
