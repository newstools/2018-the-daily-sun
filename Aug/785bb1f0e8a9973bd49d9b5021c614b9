A picture in which members of the Economic Freedom Fighters hoisting the EFF flag next to the flag of a cop shop has angered many. Sunlanders took to social media to condemn the act. However, EFF’s Limpopo secretary Jossey Buthane has dismissed the critics as “drunk”! The flag was allegedly hoisted at the Masakeneng Apel police station in Masakaneng, Groblersdal. It is not clear when the flag was hoisted. Speaking to Daily Sun, Buthane said that there was nothing wrong in what they did. “They did not remove the South African flag, so I see no error in their actions,” he said. He has also called on South Africans who are condemning the party to ocme forth and explain to them what is wrong with the picture. “It would have been a problem if they had removed the South African flag, but they did no such thing,” he said. “We will listen to reason; those condemning the act are driven by politics of hate, and we are not going to entertain them.”
