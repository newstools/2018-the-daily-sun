WHEN Mbali Nkosi’s daughter was just a year old, she came home from creche with one of her ears swollen. Two years later, the little girl came back from the same creche with both her ears swollen! The angry mum told Daily Sun  Reikagile Day Care in Dobsonville, Soweto, was becoming more and more of a nightmare for her three-year-old daughter and other kids. “Two months ago she came back from creche with swollen ears and when I asked why, they claimed her ears started to itch two hours after she was dropped off. I believe that they pinched her,” she said. “The doctor who examined her said it looked like she was pinched but it could be an insect bite. I’m gatvol.” “Kids are suffering in that place. I wonder what they do with the money we pay them if they cannot even buy decent food for the kids,” said Mbali. “The creche is also not well maintained and cleaning doesn’t seem to be a priority.” Mbali added that she pays R400 for school fees yet the creche’s fridges are always empty. Creche owner Tshegofatso Kgoleng said she was not aware of the problem. “I hardly visit the classrooms. The creche has cleaners who clean every day after the kids leave and the carpets are washed every two months. “With regard to the claims of empty fridges, we were waiting for a board member who normally buys the groceries to arrive. The fridges are full of food now.” Social development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said: “If the child was pinched, the parents have a right to lay criminal charges against the creche. “The department will visit the creche to assess their day-to-day running.”
