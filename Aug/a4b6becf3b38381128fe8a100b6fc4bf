Legendary South African media personality, Bonang Matheba has confirmed that there is a new man in her life. This after her very public breakup with rapper, Kiernan ‘AKA’ Forbes. The news came as a shock to fans because Bonang made it known, on her reality show Being Bonang that she is not interested in being with any man in the least bit. But only two weeks after the end of the reality show, she has now confirmed that she has a man. And it doesn’t seem to be a new thing. After weeks of “spoils” in the form of flowers, designer shoes and bags, and luxury candles, fans were already suspecting that something might be going. And they weren’t completely out of line because the constant display of expensive gifts on B’s Insta is usually how she announces that she has a new man. She recently posted “...all the kisses” with several love emojis. This cryptic tweeted had fans scrambling to decipher what their queen was referring to. One fan even suggested that Bonang was about to release her own single. “We're definitely getting a single "...1000 kisses" "...all the kisses" I can't believe you just keep on tweeting these lyrics & people are too blind to decipher that this actually a song you're about to change the whole game with,” he said. Although it seems he was completely off the mark, thanks to him we now know that B has a man. “It isn’t. Kisses from my man. That’s all,” Bonang responded to him. We can only wait and see who the lucky man is.
