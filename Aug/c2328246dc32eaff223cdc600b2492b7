MPHO Gebuza has been living in fear for three years. The 40-year-old businessman from Winterveld, Tshwane, says he has been getting death threats. He told Daily Sun it all started in 2014 when his truck was burned to ashes at his home. Mpho said the people responsible were arrested but the threats didn’t stop. He said he didn’t even know there were people who wanted him dead until a man approached him. “A man who was involved in burning my truck said they were paid to kill me but they decided to burn the truck instead,” he said. He said he didn’t know why someone had something against him. “What terrifies me is that I don’t know who they are and what they want from me,” he said. He said his life had become miserable and his businesses are affected. “I don’t care about money. I care about my life. I can’t die because I have four children and they still need me,” he said. Mpho said he felt like the state had failed him. “The case was dropped. I don’t understand why because there was enough evidence and a witness, who was also involved,” he said. “I am always on the run and hiding from people I don’t even know.” Police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola advised Mpho to go to the police station and tell the cops everything that had happened.
