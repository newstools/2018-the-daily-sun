CHECK out our video of the
day. In the video, the tsotsi can
be seen coming into a store and going behind the counter. As he is busy looking for
what he could steal from the shop, the customers quickly get out of the shop. Following that a lady
wearing a black and white t-shirt also gets out, closing the door behind her
and locking it, leaving the thumb thugs locked inside the shop.
