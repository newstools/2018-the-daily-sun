BEING fired from work and then not getting your compensation is painful. But being haunted by a former colleague for four decades is a truly horrible experience. Madala Mgcaseni Mkrozo (88) of Mhlabatshane Village in Mqanduli, Eastern Cape is being haunted by his dead former co-worker. He was sharing his story with deputy minister Phathekile Holomisa on Monday. In 1978 Mgcaseni was trying to stop a fight between two colleagues at a mine in Gauteng. He says he punched his colleague just once – and that was the end of him. “I never intended to kill him,” Mgcaseni said. “He was fighting with someone else, and as a supervisor I tried to stop the fight. He then pulled me by my clothes and I punched him in the face and he fell down. “He was rushed to hospital, where he died two months later.” Mgcaseni was arrested and spent five months behind bars before he was acquitted. “I told the magistrate it was self- defence, but I was fired and I never even got my benefits. I got only half of my month’s salary,” he said. The madala said he had been struggling to get over what had happened. “I have nightmares. Sometimes when I have bad luck, I believe it is the spirit of that man,” he said. Sangoma Philasande Yoko said: “He must perform a cleansing ritual and apologise to his ancestors. It could happen that the soul of the dead man is still roaming around.” Holomisa visited the area to explain to residents the services offered by the department. Career counsellors gave job seekers guidance on work opportunities and registered them on the department’s unemployment database.
