TEACHING was interrupted at Ntongande High School yesterday. This came after parents and pupils at the school in Nzalabantu, outside Richards Bay in northern KZN, protested outside. They demaned the removal of a teacher accused of having sex with a matric pupil last week. Parent Richard Ntshangase (53) said: “I’m against teachers who use their power to turn our kids into their wives at schools. “We send our kids to school to learn, not to be used to satisfy teachers’ desires. “We want the education department to investigate this matter urgently before more children fall victim to this teacher.” A grade 11 pupil said she heard a male teacher was sleeping with pupils. “They say on Friday, he was caught in action in the school office and we can’t be silent about this. He needs to go.” A matric pupil urged the department to act speedily on the matter because their preliminary exams were around the corner. “We expect teachers to protect us and not take advantage of us. “We are here to learn and not to be girlfriends. “The department should act harshly so others who are thinking of dating pupils will stop,” she said. The school clerk, Miss Jali, said the principal was not allowed to speak to the media and she couldn’t transfer the SunTeam’s call to his office. Education department spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said they were not aware of the matter but they would immediately contact the district office to investigate. “We have zero tolerance for teachers who sleep with pupils. “Once the investigation is done, we will be able to act,” he said.
