IT seems as if kasi residents have lost respect for the environment and for each other. All open spaces are filled with rubbish! Dogs, cows, goats and pigs tear the refuse bags apart in search of food. It looks as if pigs live ekasi in Emlotheni Memorial Park in New Brighton, where Vuyisile Mini and other uMkhonto we Sizwe soldiers were reburied, and near Kokoyi Courts in KwaZakhele. Silumko Magwaza (61) from New Brighton said: “We’re surrounded by rubbish everywhere. This is unacceptable. “The Metro no longer cleans parks and conditions at Emlotheni Memorial Park and others are terrible. Our people are dumping refuse by night and it stinks. The municipality must clean our areas and collect refuse.” A resident from Kokoyi Courts in KwaZakhele said: “We’ve called meetings with the residents around us, but they keep dumping rubbish at our boundary wall. “This is unfair because we’re paying rent and this rubbish stinks. Our kids are always sick and rats are troubling us.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “Refuse is collected weekly in all areas. In some places, lazy people refuse to take out their trash. He pleading with residents to place rubbish bags outside their yards on collection days.”
