Local stars have taken to the streets to join the call for an end to gender-based violence. Countless non-gender conforming individuals, gender activists and lobby groups, as well as ordinary woman joined the march across the country. The national demonstrations take part at the start of Women’s months in Mzansi, but the protest has garnered support as far as Namibia and Lesotho. An international non-governmental organization whose primary aim is to work against poverty and injustice worldwide, ActionAid has also shown its support for the cause. Among those who marched today are local stars including, Bonnie Mbuli, Rami Chuene, Pabi Moloi and Zola Hashatsi. Take a look at the pics and videos below: We are doing it for our Grand Mothers, Mother's, Sisters, Cousins and Daughters. #totalshutdown A post shared by  Zola Hashatsi (@zola_hashatsi) on Aug 1, 2018 at 4:48am PDT  #TotalShutDown Thank you ABUSIVE MEN of South Africa for forcing us start OUR month with THIS campaign!
