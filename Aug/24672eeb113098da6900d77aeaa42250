TSHEPO Mallela makes music that touches more than just the soul. The 28-year-old from Hillside View in Mangaung said he writes music which not only entertains but also inspires young people. He told Daily Sun he started writing music in 2002. “I consider myself an all-rounder. I do a mixture of hip hop, dancehall, kwaito and house. “My music motivates and supports people who are going through hard times in life, love and financially.” He said he was inspired to pursue a career in music by local group DTI. When he started, one of the group members, Thato Manale guided him through the writing process and taught him what to do. “He told me it wasn’t an easy journey and it required patience. “I spent six years practising and perfecting my skills before I went into studio. “In 2009, I taught myself how to produce and record music.” Tshepo said since then he’s released a few singles online. “In September, I’ll release my first EP which is going be a gift for my fans as it’s my birthday.” He said he was planning to help up-and-coming artists build their brands. “I believe it’s my duty to share my God-given talents.” He said it worried him that some people in his kasi drank every day. “They forget that they need to go out there and hustle,” said Tshepo.
