LESSONS have been suspended at the University of Mpumalanga’s Mbombela campus after students embarked on a violent protest on Tuesday. The students accused management of corruption. Mxolisi Ngcamphalala, president of the SRC, told Daily Sun: “Many allegations have been levelled against management and we are not taking them lightly. “We are calling for an immediate investigation.” He said the housing director was being accused of misusing funds for accommodation and overcharging students. “We have been complaining about the housing director for a long time. “Many students have been left with no safe and secure place to stay because of her incompetence,” said Mxolisi. “The university must remove her or we will do it ourselves. “She does not follow the policy of off-campus accreditation. “She accredited a place without even seeing it. “Some places were accredited when they didn’t even have beds, electricity and water. “This matter is being covered up by management and they are busy shifting the goal posts, all in the name of protecting the housing director.” Mxolisi said they have been complaining about other issues as well, but no one listened. “Several meeting were held but nothing happened. That’s why we decided to protest.” University spokesman Themba Manana promised to come back to Daily Sun with a comment but failed to do so. When the SunTeam tried to call him again, his phone was on voicemail.
