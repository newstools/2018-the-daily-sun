EACH day that passes, Suen’s dream of furthering his studies slowly fades. Suen Sibiya (27) from Mandela Village near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga said he had been applying for an ID since he was in high school in 2010. He said Home Affairs officials told him to bring his mother’s particulars. But Suen said his mother died when he was only three years old. “I can’t get my ID because I have nothing that links me to my mother. My school principal tried her best to help me but failed. I wrote my matric without it.” “I have tried many times to go to her family to ask for her death certificate, but they told me they don’t have it. I even went to the hospital where I was born to check my birth records. “My mother’s ID number wasn’t there. I gave the officials a letter from my primary school and local chief but this was not enough,” he said. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the manager in Mpumalanga had been in contact with the client to get more information and resolve the matter.
