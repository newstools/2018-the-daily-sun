TO Joyce Nkosi, losing her dog Spike meant losing her child. Joyce told Daily Sun Spike went missing on Sunday. The dog apparently was snatched by a drunk who took him to a tavern before disappearing. The 32-year-old from Cultura in Bronkhorstspruit said her pitbull might have got out when the gate was open. But she said it was not the first time Spike had gone outside the yard. “He used to get out when we opened the gates for the car but always came home. “It would take less than 15 minutes for the dog to return.” On Monday, Joyce began her desperate search for Spike, putting up pictures of the dog all over and asking people who might have known of his whereabouts to help. She said during her search, she was told the dog was seen with a man at the tavern. When she got to the tavern, the owner confirmed that a man was seen at the premises with the dog and used his belt to tie it to a burglar door outside while boozing inside. The tavern owner also gave Joyce the CCTV tapes, where she could see the man who took her beloved Spike. Joyce has opened a case of theft at the Bronkhorstspruit Police Station. “My husband bought the dog as a Christmas present for our seven-year-old daughter.” She wants the guy who stole the dog to know stealing is wrong and to bring him back. “I could just buy another dog but it will not replace Spike. So I want him back,” she said. Captain Sipho Zulu confirmed that a case has been opened and is being investigated.
