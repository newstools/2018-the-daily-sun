RESIDENTS of George Goch Hostel in Jeppestown, Joburg, had a rude awakening on Tuesday. Police and Metro cops conducted early-morning raids and arrested six people for possession of drugs, illegal firearms, dangerous weapons, and for selling liquor without permits. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said the aim of Operation Buya Mthetho was to enforce by-laws and prevent crime. “Operation Buya Mthetho is in full swing, and we’re gradually realising its objective of combating crime in the province,” he said. He said cops were making a point of pouncing unannounced. “We raided the hostel with the aim of recovering unlawful firearms and illegal substances.” He said their mission was accomplished. “We recovered three unlicensed firearms and other dangerous weapons.” Firearms were seized during body searches. The suspects will appear in court soon. George Goch Hostel is known as one of the most dangerous hostels in Joburg. Earlier this year, police found heist suspects at the hostel after a cash van was bombed in Boksburg.
