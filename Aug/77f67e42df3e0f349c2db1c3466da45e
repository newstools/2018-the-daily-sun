COPS are looking for Kenneth Chewe, who is suspected of stabbing his girlfriend in the neck with a knife in July last year. Police spokeswoman Constable Sibongile Vuma said Chewe allegedly took his girlfriend and her niece to the Pretoria West Hospital after the incident, where she died. Vuma said he then took the dead woman’s Opel Corsa bakkie and her clothes before driving away. “It is alleged that the suspect crossed the border into Botswana,” said Vuma. She said the Botlokwa police were contacted to be on the look out for the bakkie as the suspect is originally from Sekgosese Village in Botlokwa, Limpopo. “They discovered that the bakkie was parked at his home, but he was nowhere to be found,” said Vuma. She said Chewe allegedly sometimes used a black Honda Edix with the Botswana registration number B754AXL or a gold Toyota Fortuner (B182AWS), both of which belonged to owners in Gaborone. Anyone with information on Chewe’s whereabouts should contact Vuma on 072 067 0188 or the investigating officer, Sergeant Molelekeng on 012 386 4163/6, or 083 726 0332 or their nearest police station.
