THESE friends are proud of themselves. Instead of complaining about lack of employment, they decided to start guarding cars at Motherwell shopping centre in Port Elizabeth. Andile Gqolodashe (30), Thando Rungqu (32) and Masixole Ntukelo (33) started guarding vehicles seven years ago. Andile told Daily Sun: “We’re proud of our work because the money we make helps us to survive. “People do their shopping comfortably knowing their vehicles are safe. “We also wash cars for a reasonable fee. “The money we get makes a difference in our lives.” Andile said he lives with 19 family members and most of them are unemployed. Thando said business was bad when it rained. “We are always busy on Fridays and month end. “In addition to guarding vehicles, we also wash cars,” he told the People’s Paper. “We want to get trained and become professional car guards. “We are appealing to Good Samaritans to help us with reflective uniforms.” Masixole said the money he maded helped him put food on the table. “Unemployment in the province is high. But I’m happy because the money I make helps me survive.” Thembakazi January of Wells Estate said: “I feel safe leaving my car in the hands of these guys. “They always make sure that my car is clean and protected. “Crime in Port Elizabeth is high, but these guys are making a difference. “This also helps to create work for them because unemployment in the province is high.”
