WHEN British singer Amy Winehouse wrote a song titled Love Is a Losing Game, she probably had no idea the title would be a good description of Mpho Phela’s situation. Mpho (34) claims a close friend stabbed him in more ways than one. According to Mpho, who lives in block R of Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, his friend plunged a knife into his back eight times in May. To make matters worse, the man allegedly stole his girlfriend as well. Mpho said he was forced to flee his shack in Atteridgeville after the incident. He told Daily Sun he was at a tavern when the stabbing took place. He said his friend hugged him before driving the knife into his back and arm. Mpho said he collapsed and woke up at Kalafong Hospital, where he was treated for two days. “I never thought my best friend would turn into a devil. “He almost killed me,” he said. Mpho said he was too scared to return to Atteridgeville. “I don’t want to go back to my girlfriend because she almost got me killed,” he said. He said he also feared his friend would kill him if they crossed paths again. Mpho said he wanted the man to be arrested and sentenced. “Justice must prevail,” said an angry Mpho. When the SunTeam contacted Mpho’s former girlfriend, she admitted she knew him but hung up when she was asked more questions. Police spokeswoman Mapula Rikhotso said the suspect was arrested and the matter was referred to court. Rikhotso said the victim’s friends refused to give statements. “The prosecuter refused to place the case on the roll and demanded the victim’s friends make statements,” said Rikhotso. She said the case was still pending.
