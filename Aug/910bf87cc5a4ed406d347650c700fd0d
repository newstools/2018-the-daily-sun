CORRUPTION is on the rise at schools. This was revealed when Corruption Watch released its Analysis of Corruption Trends report. Yesterday’s report deals with cases reported to the organisation by members of the public between January and the end of June. It shows that 2 469 cases of corruption were lodged with the organisation in the first two quarters of the year, compared to a total of 2 744 during the same period last year. Cases in Gauteng had increased, with 39,8% coming from the province, compared to 37,3% last year. “The cases received showed features of principals, SGB members and staff members conspiring and colluding to rob schools of funds and resources, with the sole goal of creating favourable conditions for friends and relatives who seek procurement deals and jobs,” read the report. Corruption Watch executive director David Lewis said: “While the headlines and the national debate are focused on stories of grand corruption, spare a thought for the child whose lunch is stolen, for the hospital patient who is forced to pay for care at a public hospital, for the community terrorised by gangsters and drug dealers who have bribed the local cops councillors to look the other way.”
