FOUR men were arrested after appearing in the Delmas High
Court Mpumalanga in connection with cash-in-transit heist charges. One of the men is South Africa’s most wanted cash-in-transit
heist kingpin, Wellington Cenanda. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said the men, who were
out on bail, and they thought it was business as usual. Little did they know that the Hawks were a step ahead of
them, when the court adjourned. The moment they left the court room the Hawks ambushed them. Mulaudzi said one was allegedly linked to a 2016 foiled
cash-in-transit heist in Gravelotte, Limpopo - while the other three suspects
were positively linked to a cit heist which happened in Carolina, Mpumalanga. It is alleged the 39 year old suspect was allegedly part of
a 12 member armed group that attacked an armoured vehicle using three vehicles
in Gravelotte. “The armoured vehicle was shot at and the armed crewman returned
fire. One of the suspects’ vehicles attempted to ram the van but lost control
and crashed,” Mulaudzi said. The suspects allegedly hijacked a passing motorist and the
group fled the scene empty handed. He said whilst the three other suspects allegedly took part
in an attempted armed robbery where they attacked an armoured vehicle on the
R33 Wonderfontein – Carolina road. The armoured vehicle was sprayed with bullets, prompting the
armed guards to retaliate and after an aggressive standoff the armed group also
left empty handed. They appear in court on Thursday next week, wherethey will
apply for bail.
