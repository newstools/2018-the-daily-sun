THE inmates looked stylish in their formal clothes as they took to the stage to compete in an academic competition. Last week 281 inmates, from eight prisons in Gauteng, took part in a three-day competition at Boksburg Correctional Services in Ekurhuleni. They were competing for a spot in the Funda Mzansi Championship to be held in George, Western Cape in October. The competition started in 2013 to encourage inmates to start book clubs to improve their reading skills. The competition saw inmates challenging each other in reading, debating and spelling in all 11 languages. At the end of the competition, 40 inmates were chosen to compete in the championship. Although those who did not make it were disappointed, Gauteng regional commissioner Grace Molatedi said she was impressed to note inmates had massively improved from last year. “I was listening with amusement. At least while we are using WhatsApp and cutting words, there are people out there who can still spell,” she said. Bafana Nkosi, one of the 40 chosen to go to George, told Daily Sun that apart from entering the competition, he had been studying a human resources and management course and would be graduating next month.
