ULULATION filled the air and the rhythm from the ingomane drum kept calling everyone to sing along. Friends and family members joined in the fun as thwasa Portia Mohapi graduated as an inyanga and prophet under the leadership of gobela Nomsa Gumede from Majasana farm, Grasmere, south of Joburg. Thwasa Portia was dressed in traditional garb when she came out of indumba. She first went through the tough test of pointing out where the isifihlo were, (hidden body parts of the goat, like skin and horns) and inhlolo or taola (one of the bones she’ll use when consulting). Born in Diepkloof, Soweto but based in Orange Farm, south of Joburg, Portia said she used to dream a lot about the way sangomas dressed, but didn’t understand its meaning. “In one of the dreams I saw ighabango, the stick of the ancestors used during ceremonial dances,” said Portia. She added that she was constantly ill, but doctors could not find anything wrong. Then, one day she went to a sangoma who told her she should become an inyanga. Portia said her ancestors from her mother’s side directed her to gobela Nomsa, who took her through her iphehlo, or training. Portia said part of her training was knowing how to phahla, or connect with her ancestors, and to call them for guidance. “I know how to read ditaola. I also know the difference types of muthi and how to mix them. I’m ready to heal the nation,” she said. Gobela Nomsa said: “I trained her to heal people. If she practises witchcraft, the ancestors will take her powers away.” Tshegofatso Makhene, Portia’s daughter, said: “er pain is mine and I support her all the way. I’m glad today is over and she has accepted her calling.”
