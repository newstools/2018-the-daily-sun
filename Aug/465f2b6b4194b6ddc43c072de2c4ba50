THE Momba cousins feel sorry for people who think washing cars is a man’s job. Chifuniro (24) and Mary (32) from Mfuleni in Cape Town make a living from it. Chifuniro said: “These days you can’t say this is a man’s job. “There are no jobs and people can’t afford to be picky.” She and Mary are originally from Malawi. “At first I was not too sure about this,” said Mary. “But my cousin showed me how to do it and now I’m good at it.” Chifuniro told Daily Sun: “We guarantee that when people bring their cars here they won’t be disappointed because we do a great job.” The cousins are grateful to everyone who support their business, Super Car. “Some people were not too sure about us at first until they brought their cars,” said Chifuniro. “We thank them for trusting us with their cars.” Ntobeko Tukane (39), a regular customer, said he was proud of the two women. “They’re doing a good job,” he said. “I’m not from around this area, but I bring my car to them whenever I visit a friend.” He said he’d never stop bringing his car to them. “I’m impressed with their work,” he said.
