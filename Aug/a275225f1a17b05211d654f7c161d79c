HEEHAW! Here comes the flying squad! It seems these cops have found a lasting solution to Mzansi’s constant shortage of cop cars. A video of cops travelling on a donkey cart, whip in hand, has gone viral after it emerged over the weekend. Police top brass are investigating and have said that, as soon as they’ve established what was happening, they’ll take it from there. National spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo told Daily Sun yesterday they would first try to establish where the video was taken. “We’ll then establish what was happening and take it from there,” he said. The video received mixed reaction on social media platforms. One cop whips one of the two donkeys in an attempt to make it move a bit faster. The cops talk in what sounds like Sotho or Tswana and laugh. Some people said the video was fun, while others said it portrayed exactly the attention police gave to emergency calls. People said cops often took forever to arrive when called to attend to crimes, as if they were indeed driving donkey carts. “We don’t care what was happening there, but this video is an exact example of the police response to issues,” said Siyabonga Mchunu on Facebook. Other users said police needed to change their behaviour. “No one calls the police for fun. When you call them, it’s because you need help,” wrote Nolwazi Sithole. But other users said the video was funny. “Police officers are people, too. They can test-drive a donkey cart when there’s one and they feel like it,” said Lwandile Zungu. Efforts to establish where the video was taken were unsuccessful. The SunTeam sent it to cops, but it hadn’t been established by the time of going to print where the cops were from – or going.
