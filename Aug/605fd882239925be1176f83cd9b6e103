THE Philison family in Waterval Boven, Mpumalanga needs help to find their missing loved one. Sibusiso Philison (22), who is deaf, was last seen on 10 August. His brother, Ndumiso Philison (28) said when they woke up the following day, Sibusiso was not in his bedroom. Ndumiso told Daily Sun at first they thought he was in the toilet, but they were surprised he was taking so long. “I went to check in the toilet and he was not there. I then thought he had gone to the nearby gym as he often did. As time went by I realised something was wrong because he never came back home.” Ndumiso said he and his uncle asked around the area about Sibusiso’s whereabouts, but no one had seen him. “What worries us is that he is deaf. “We are appealing to SunReaders to help us find Sibusiso.” Mpumalanga police spokesman Captain Gerald Sedibe confirmed that a case of a missing person was reported. Anyone with information should call Captain Selome Singh on 076 343 2874 or Constable Sipho Seepe on 082 054 3610.
