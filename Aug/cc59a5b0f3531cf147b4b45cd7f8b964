KHOLEKA Dlamini went to thwasa for almost a year but did not complete the process. She also wanted to become a singer like her mum, but things aren’t going her way. It has been seven months since Kholeka (35) from B1 in Mamelodi West, Tshwane buried her mum, maskandi singer Danisile “Five Roses” Khambule. “I was hurt when my mum died and thought my life was over,” she said. Kholeka said she has no one to pay for her sangoma training. She told Daily Sun when she turned 15 she started dreaming of her late gogo, who instructed her to become a sangoma. “But I resisted until I became sick for 15 years. “I had terrible headaches, lost weight and bled from my nose. “When I answered the call to become a sangoma, I was healed,” she said. Kholeka said she wants to keep her mum’s musical legacy alive. She has written 10 songs, but has no money to approach music producers to record them. The mother of four is begging SunReaders to help her fulfil her calling.
