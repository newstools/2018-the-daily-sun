THE off-duty cop who was shot dead last month was buried in Toleni Village, Mount Frere, on Saturday. Sergeant Siyabulela Mtati (42) was gunned down on 29 July. Mtati was shot in the stomach, chest and leg after he confronted two men who were arguing inside a car parked near his home. Brigadier Mtutuzeli Mtukushe said: “Mtati died in the line of duty. He’s lying here because he said it would be better if he called the police on the men he was talking to.” Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga said: “This has not been a good year for us because a lot of officers have died at the hands of criminals. “We’re being attacked by the people we swore to protect. The only thing we can do is stay strong and move forward.” Deputy national police commissioner General Sindile Mfazi said senior management couldn’t let officers die with guns in their hands. “I’m impressed by this officers’ conduct. “He put his life on the line for the safety of his community,” he said. Mfazi said he was also impressed by the officers, who arrested the criminals within 24 hours. The two suspects, aged 25 and 30, were arrested in Qumbu. A suspected murder weapon, a 9mm pistol, was confiscated during the arrest.
