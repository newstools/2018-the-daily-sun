South Africans are known for laughing their way through anything in life. They are also known to be able to turn a horrible situation into something worth laughing over. This was proven true when Mzansi embarked on an #AdamCatzavelosChallenge! Following the racist rant of businessman Adam Catzavelos last week, Mzansi has taken to imitating his “forecast.” Videos have been posted on Twitter, in which people are shown doing the #AdamCatzavelosChallenge. Celebrities and citizens of Mzansi alike participated in the challenge. The trend quickly went viral, and soon, Twitter was flooded with videos of the challenge.
