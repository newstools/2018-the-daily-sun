SANGOMAS, prophets and Rastafarians gathered to collect the spirits of the accident victims on the N8 highway between Botshabelo and Bloemfontein on Friday. The group believe the road has many roaming spirits that need to be guided to a resting place. They burnt impepho on the side of the road to call those who died there. According to sangoma Mamoya Rakauoane, Mangaung Metro Municipality mayor Olly Mlamleli told her she was concerned about the endless accidents that have left many people dead on the N8. Mamoya told Daily Sun that, almost every day, people lose their lives on the road, making it the permanent home of the uncollected spirits. She said: “The road is haunted and motorists end up losing control of their vehicles. “I felt obliged to do something. After speaking with the mayor, I gathered spiritual and traditional healers to appease the N8 victims. Some families do not collect their relatives’ sprits at accident scenes. They are not aware of the harm these spirits can cause.” But one of the motorists from section C in Botshabelo, Tumelo Ramasiu, does not believe that the road is haunted by spirits of the dead. Tumelo said: “In order to avoid accidents, motorists should rest enough and they should not drink and drive. “There is nothing wrong with the N8. People should just drive more carefully to avoid causing these deadly accidents.”
