 Two convicted criminals escaped from police custody on Friday morning while being transported from Ellisras to Polokwane. Colonel Sakkie Louwrens told News24 that Petrus Moyo and Witness Shimango broke the roof of the moving police vehicle and jumped out in Marken, Limpopo.  "One is a convicted murderer and the other a house robber," said Louwrens.   According to Louwrens, the men had fled on foot. In November, Moyo also escaped from police custody in Lephalale. News24 reported at the time that Moyo was part of a group of armed men who fatally shot Dr Werner Emslie and also injured his wife - who is also a doctor – during a farm attack on September 20.
