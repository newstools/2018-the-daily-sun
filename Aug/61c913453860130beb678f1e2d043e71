THE senior traditional leader of Tswinga, outside Thohoyandou wants his community to acknowledge the important role played by elderly women. Chief Tshishonga Netswinga made the plea at the annual village Women’s Month function held on Saturday. The event kicked off with a fun walk from the royal palace to the local sports field. Nditsheni Netshivhambe, the regional health department’s deputy director of non-communicable diseases, shared health tips with the gogos. Event spokesman Khamusi Makungo said the function was launched several years ago after consultations with the chief. “The event is growing more popular. “Last year, about 200 people took part in the fun walk. “This year the number increased to 600, despite the rain. “With the support of our sponsors, we hope the event will grow from strength to strength,” he said. Chief Netswinga said he was worried about women abuse. “Women are the engine of society. “They brought us into this world, yet we tend to forget them when we become prosperous. “Most gogos are breadwinners and have to take care of entire families with their social grant. “Let us give them the respect they deserve and celebrate them while they are still alive. If we do that, God will bless us,” he said. The chief also thanked the sponsors for making the event a success. Nthambeleni Randitsheni, founder of insurance firm NRand Brokers, said the company felt compelled to support the chief’s initiative. He said: “We are a company that focuses on people’s needs. “We have a responsibility to support worthy causes and will continue to do this for as long as our bank account allows it.”
