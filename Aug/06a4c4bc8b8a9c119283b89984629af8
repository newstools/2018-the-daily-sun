The inaugural International Women in Media Conference has lost its scheduled host, iconic media personality, Bonang Matheba. This after a social media storm broke out when one of their alleged keynote speakers, Taraji P. Henson blasted them on Twitter for “false advertising”. The Empire actresses called news of her appearance at the conference, due to take place on 5 and 6 September in Sandton, Johannesburg, as blatant “fake news” yesterday. Following her Twitter rant, the conference organizers have since pulled all advertising using her name and image, as well as that of Halle Berry from all advertising. This major embarrassment lead to the Queen B* pulling out of her hosting duties, just hours after the press launch, citing a lack of clear communication and mismanagement from 21st Century Group, who are behind the conference. In a statement to the media, Bonang has distanced herself from the mess. “As there has been no official feedback or clarity from the organisers following [yesterday’s] allegations, Ms Matheba will not be participating,” the statement read.
