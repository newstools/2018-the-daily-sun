The Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May is headed for South Africa. The
presidency announced that May will be coming to South Africa on Tuesday. May’s visit
follows bilateral meetings between President Ramaphosa and Prime Minister May
during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London from 19
to 20 April and at the G7 in Canada on 8 and 9 June this year. The
presidency also said that the visit, termed a working visit, by May seeks to
further cement economic relations built up over several decades. The last
official visit to South Africa by a United Kingdom Prime Minister was in 2011. During the
bilateral engagements the two leaders discussed potential partnerships between
the United Kingdom and South Africa and efforts to strengthen bilateral trade
and investment relations. “Bilateral
relations between South Africa and the United Kingdom are strong, covering a
range of areas of cooperation linked to both governments’ priorities,” the
presidency said. “These
relations are managed through a Bilateral Forum at Ministerial level which
meets biennially.” May will
also present Ramaphosa with the SS Mendi Bell which was found in the English
Channel a year ago. The SS
Mendi is a ship that suffered a disastrous shipwreck in 1917 in the English
Channel, in which 646 people, most of them black South African troops, died. “In 2017,
the South African government commemorated the centenary of the sinking of SS
Mendi which resulted in the loss of over 800 lives who were mainly South
Africans. “The handing
over of the SS Mendi Bell to the people of South Africa is a mark of respect
for the shared history and bilateral friendship between the two countries,” the
presidency said.
