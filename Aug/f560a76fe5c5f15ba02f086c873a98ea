MATIMBA Makaringe’s tough life turned her into a strong woman. She now helps young and old women who’re experiencing challenges. She said after surviving hardships, she decided to start a project called Misscourage. The 28-year-old from Nkowankowa in Tzaneen told Daily Sun: “I counsel women who’re suffering from all sorts of abuse. “I first tell women about my life story before helping them. “I was once abused physically and emotionally. “My boyfriend left me with huge debt. He took out a loan under my name and I’m now left to pay back the debt.” She said she once suffered third degree burns on her body. “I spent weeks in hospital and couldn’t walk for three months,” she said. “While I was still recovering my gogo died in 2015. And to make matters worse I discovered that I was pregnant. “Four months into my pregnancy I suffered a miscarriage caused by the depression. My burn wounds weren’t completely healed. But she never gave up on life. Matimba said she often does one-on-one consultations and has created a Facebook page (fb-misscourage) and WhatsApp group for abused women. “I also organise hiking events for abuse survivors to climb mountains.” She said the next mountain- climbing event would be held on 25 August at Groenkloof Nature Reserve in Tshwane. “The event is meant for women who have accepted their flaws and it will be followed by lunch at the Khanimambo Guest House. The guest speaker will be Aya Hlubi.”
