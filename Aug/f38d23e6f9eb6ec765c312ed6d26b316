FOREIGNERS who own salons and barber shops in Church Street in Pietermaritzburg, KZN Midlands, are crying out for help. They were allegedly tormented by Msunduzi Municipality licensing office cops last week. They told Daily Sun the cops destroyed and confiscated their equipment. Barber shop owner Abdul Kone (48) said the operation started on Monday. “They took 14 clippers on Monday and another three on Friday,” said Abdul. “My work is affected and I can’t make money to support my family.” He said after the first operation on Monday, he went to the municipal offices in an attempt to get his stuff back. He said the raid was unfair because they were in Mzansi legally and paid fees to the municipality. “Every month I pay to operate my barber shop,” he said. “It’s very unfair that they sent cops to destroy and confiscate my stuff, even though I do respect by-laws.” Municipal spokeswoman Thobeka Mafumbatha confirmed that there were operations last week. “If they’re certain that their belongings were taken unfairly, they may come to our licensing office with their permits and the confiscated working material will be released. “Regarding any form of physical or verbal attack, they can report that to the cops.”
