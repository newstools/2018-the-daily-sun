ZAMA zamas have been visiting a squatter camp in Randfontein, Rand West City, and making residents stay up all night in fear, as if they were owls. Nolusapho Ntabeni (53), of Dumping Site squatter camp, said the zama zamas roamed around at night waving big guns. “The next morning, you will hear they made their way into one of the shacks and robbed the people inside. We woke up on Tuesday morning to news that three people had been shot,” she said. According to residents, the three victims are in hospital fighting for their lives. Nolusapho said they had told the police about the behaviour of the zama zamas. “The Randfontein police told us that they were scared of coming to the area at night because they could be shot at,” she said. Charles Joko (49) said the zama zamas also robbed local spazas at night. He said on Monday night, a zama zama pointed a gun at his face and pulled the trigger but luckily the gun jammed. Sifo Tholo (30) said his brother, Moses (20), was one of three people who was shot. “They shot him in the mouth. I don’t know how he survived.” Lumkile Masango (36) said the zama zamas hid in a heap of rubble left behind by miners during the day and surfaced at night to rob people. Randfontein police spokeswoman Captain Apple Ernst said the police are aware of what is happening in the area and are investigating cases of murder and attempted murder. She said cops are also shot at when they go to the area at night.
