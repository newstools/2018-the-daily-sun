A DOMESTIC worker is in hot water after her boss was found dead. On 26 March, Zorah Jogee (50) was found strangled in her home in Kroonstad, Free State. The domestic worker and her accomplice were arrested in Evaton, south of Joburg on Tuesday. Captain Stephen Thakeng said: “A murder case was opened after a businesswoman was found strangled at her home. “The domestic worker was missing and a hunt was launched.” On the day of the incident, Zorah’s husband came home for lunch, leaving his wife and the domestic worker behind when he returned to work. He started worrying when his wife didn’t respond to his calls, as she was supposed to relieve him at their business. “Then the security company called the husband as it seemed the electricity at their home had been tampered with. “On arrival at the house, the door was wide open and his wife was lying on the floor, her hands and feet tied,” Thakeng said.. “She was bleeding from her nose and a cloth had been plugged into her mouth. “Paramedics certified her dead at the scene.” Thakeng said a task team of Kroonstad crime prevention staff and detective services was formed under the leadership of Sergeant Solomon Sefadi to trace the suspect. “On Saturday, the team received information about the domestic worker’s whereabouts, which led them to Evaton, where she was arrested. “More information followed, which led to the arrest of the second suspect. “The two women, aged 54 and 35, appeared in the Kroonstad Magistrates Court on Wednesday and the case was postponed to 13 August for a bail application,” Thakeng said.
