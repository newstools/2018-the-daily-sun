South African Minister of Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa has granted actor, Atandwa Kani his long-standing wish! Last month, Atandwa asked the minister to give him some recognition on his Twitter account for the wonderful work he has been doing in the acting world. Minister Mthethwa is much praised for his constant recognition of local talent and always being among the first to congratulate our stars who do well internationally. “I played the young Madiba in “Long Walk to Freedom”, was the Xhosa Assistant dialect coach on Black Panther, now the voice of the new “Mandela’s Prison Letters”... @NathiMthethwaSA Do I get a tweet?” Atandwa jokingly pleaded. Naturally, Atandwa left his location setting on for all to see that he was tweeting from Manhattan in New York City. Well, as the Bible saying goes, ask and ye shall receive. The kind minister has now given the theatre and movie actor the shoutout he asked for, much to the delight of Atandwa’s fans. “We take this opportunity to congratulate celebrated Actor @AtandwaKani who was chosen to play the young Madiba in "Long Walk to Freedom" & has recently been selected to be the voice for 'Mandela's Peison Letters.' We are proud of you, keep flying the flag high! #IamTheFlag,” tweeted the minister. The prince of theatre, as Atandwa is known, was overcome with gratitude. “Oh My GOODNESS!!! Thank you honorable minister... I am humbled & really appreciative of your work & passion,” he responded.
