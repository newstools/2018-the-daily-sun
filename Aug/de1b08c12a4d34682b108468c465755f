A 32-year-old man was hijacked at gunpoint by five men in Renoster Road, Manenberg in the Western Cape. The suspects put him into the boot of his car before starting to drive around. Three suspects were dropped off at an undisclosed location. “The remaining two suspects then drove around in the Philippi precinct with the victim still in the boot of the vehicle. At the corner of Olieboom and Varkensvlei roads the vehicle collided with a rock, which caused a flat tyre,” Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said. The police deployed in the area were doing high density patrols when they saw the vehicle with the damaged tyre, and pulled over to assist. Van Wyk said when the police opened the boot of the silver Honda Jazz they found the 32-year-old victim there. “The two suspects tried to flee, but the 21-year- old suspect was arrested at the scene. A search immediately ensued in the farm area for the suspect who had fled. They found him and he attempted to escape again. But the K9 members wrestled with him and brought him under control. Both suspects were arrested and will be appearing in court soon,” Van Wyk said.
