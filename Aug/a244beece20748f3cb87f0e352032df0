THIS kasi school caters for kids with special needs. But Matshidiso Learners Special Education Needs in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, has been broken into several times. Thugs are even stealing the palisade fence, bit by bit. The school has suffered more than R100 000 in damage in recent months. Principal Thapelo Tshetlo said burglaries happened regularly, especially during school holidays. He told Daily Sun thugs even stole wires from the electricity distribution boxes. Tshetlo said the school had patrollers, but they let them go because the burglaries happened on their watch. “The guards were fired because government couldn’t spend money on them while there were constant burglaries at the school.” Frederick Masilo, chairman of the SGB, said it was a disgrace that thugs were targeting a special needs school. He said residents were failing to stop the burglaries. “The school has been targeted by thugs several times,” said Masilo. “What’s even worse is that community members who witness some of these crimes fail to report them to the cops.” The school is the only one of its kind in the area. Masilo said if something wasn’t done soon, the whole palisade fence would disappear. “The fence that was donated to the school keeps disappearing, metre by metre. “The distribution board boxes in most of the classrooms have also been stripped.” Tshetlo said the school used different pieces of equipment to train pupils in various handwork. “It’s become difficult to train pupils, now that the electrical equipment has been stolen.” He appealed to residents to report perpetrators to cops. Tsakane police spokeswoman Sergeant Lerato Mngomezulu said investigations were ongoing and no arrest had been made.
