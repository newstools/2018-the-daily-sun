EMPLOYEES of 1KZN TV are leaving the community TV station because they are unhappy with their salaries. There are allegations that the station’s executive producer, Elize Viljoen, is earning much more than other staff members. Former 1KZN employee Nokelemane Langa told Daily Sun he left the station in February. “They were not paying me enough. I was a producer and presenter of Ugubhu Lwam,” he said. Langa said he tried to negotiate for a better salary, but failed. “When I started working there, I earned R1 400 for two years. After another two years, I earned R2 100. I was earning R7 300 before I left.” He said he worked hard to establish his show. “I had been rendering my service for peanuts. My show had many adverts, so I don’t understand why they were paying me so badly,” said Langa. Another former employee, Nondumiso Cebekhulu, said she left for the same reason. “I worked there for seven years. They underpay a lot of employees. A lot of the people I started with left because they were earning practically nothing,” she said. Viljoen denied the allegations. “I don’t know where this is coming from. Payment depends on the experience you have. We have financial problems like any other media house. But I haven’t heard of any resignation since we encountered the problems.”
