WHEN the local councillor delivered material for Mandla Mkhwanazi to build himself a house in 2016, he was overjoyed. But his excitement turned to disappointment when the councillor allegedly took everything away – again. Apparently, it was not the first time that he was being given an RPD. As a result, the 60-year-old madala from Pinetown, west of Durban, is stuck in a rundown, leaking mud house. “The councillor told me he’d found out I had an RDP already,” he said. The madala said he applied for one in Edabe 21 years ago, but moved before the houses were built. “I suspect the house was built after I’d left. This is now giving me problems.” He said the human settlements department now saw him as someone who had already been helped. He asked that the department intervene, but spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi said he couldn’t and referred queries to the municipality. Municipal spokesman Mandla Nsele said: “The system has shown that he’s either the current or former owner of another property and doesn’t qualify.”
