WHEN she finished her degree in social sciences at the University of Zululand two years ago, she thought she was going to find a job and fend for her family. But Siphesihle Khumalo (26) from KwaDindi Village in Ulundi, northern KZN, said she and her three younger siblings instead found themselves drowning in poverty. She told Daily Sun two of her brothers were staying in neighbours’ homes while she and her sister were staying with an aunt. “The three-roomed mud house we were living in for many years was damaged by heavy rain and wind in September last year,” said Siphesihle. “We’ve been left homeless and, as a result, we ended up looking for shelter elsewhere. “My wish is that I find any job while waiting for an opening that suits the one I qualified for. “I’m also asking from any Good Samaritan to see us through this hard time.” Their dad was never a part of their lives. Their mum Khethiwe Sithole left to look for piece jobs. Councillor Dumisani Khoza said: “I heard about their plight after the storm left them without shelter. “I filed a report with the municipality, but we’re still waiting. We urge anyone who might be able to lend a hand to come forward.”
