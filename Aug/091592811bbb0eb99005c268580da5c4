ALEX FM employees will not go another month without receiving their salaries. On Tuesday the Joburg High Court ruled that Alex FM’s previous board members should handover all the station’s accounts to the interim board. They were also told not to interfere with the day to day running of the station. The previous board went to the bank and requested that no one could access the station’s accounts without their authority. This caused a backlog in the payment of salaries. Interim board chairman Isaac Mangena expressed his joy over the ruling. “We have been cleared. I am particularly happy because the staff will no longer have to endure the pain of going another month without getting their salaries,” said Mangena. He said he was happy the ruling would emphasise the need for the community to have its station back. “This is the start of a new chapter, which will see the interim board work towards turning the station around. We will hand it over to the community at the annual general meeting, which should take place soon,” said Mangena. “We have always said things didn’t have to come to this, but it was necessary to make the previous board understand. It’s time to work towards fixing Alex FM for the sake of the community.” The previous board interdicted 26 workers who accused them of mismanagement. During the dispute, no presenters were on air for three weeks.
