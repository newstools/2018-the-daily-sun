One person was killed and three others injured after a
shootout in Tongaat, KwaZulu Natal. A VW Polo reportedly crashed into a tree on the side of the
road and the driver had collapsed over the passenger. The driver had a gunshot wound to his back and died at the
scene. Reaction Unit South Africa spokesperson Prem Balram said two
other passengers in the car had also sustained gunshot wounds and were treated
by paramedics. A fourth person was found with a gunshot wound to his face, one
kilometre away from the scene. Reaction Officers says they received several different
versions of what occurred had. Balram said initially it was alleged that the VW Polo was
involved in a cash-in-transit robbery, then it was later established that there
was no cash-in-transit robbery that had occurred. According to Balram the second version they received was
that the VW Polo was being pursued by a Toyota Hilux bakkie, when the occupants
of the car opened fire at the bakkie. The occupants of the bakkie reportedly returned fire and
shot the four men in the VW Polo. It is alleged that the shooting could also be related to
taxi violence.
