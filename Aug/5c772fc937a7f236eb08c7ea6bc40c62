GOGO Johanna Mathe (63) fears her house could collapse at any moment. The gogo from Chebeng Village outside Polokwane, Limpopo said ever since her neighbour installed a septic tank, parts of her wall had started cracking. “I had been living peacefully until my neighbour got the tank a year ago,” she said. Gogo Johanna said she was worried the damage was irreversible. She said a local construction worker who assessed the damage told her the house would collapse if anyone tampered with her walls. Gogo Johanna said the water from her neighbour’s tank flowed beneath her house. “Now my floors are always cold and smelly. “I live in fear because there is a possibility my house might cave in. “These thoughts torture me. “I tried to speak to my neighbour about the matter but she just ignores me.” The gogo said she believed her neighbour was not taking her seriously because she lived alone and couldn’t do anything to her. She told the SunTeam she had to stop using her borehole because she couldn’t drink water that had sewage in it. “The water from my borehole was brown and I suspect my neighbour’s sewage was to blame.” Jacqueline Mathapo, the neighbour, said she suspected the installation of the tank made gogo Johanna jealous. “We were living peacefully, but when I installed the tank she stopped talking to us. “She also has a sewage problem but we never complained, so why is she complaining about us?” Jacqueline said she was not surprised the gogo went to the SunTeam. “At first she sent the police and then it was government officials. Now it’s Daily Sun. “This is pure jealousy. Everyone knows the land in our area is wet, so it makes no sense for someone to complain about damp floors.”
