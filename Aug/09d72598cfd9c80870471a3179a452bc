YOU will be forgiven for thinking the Wheelz n Smoke Arena
in Liefde en Vrede, south of Joburg was full of soccer fans. It was indeed full of spin lovers, during the birthday
celebration of car spinner Jeff James who was turning 47. The sport has become popular day by day in South Africa. It is loved by both young and old. Spinners around Gauteng came to support their fellow master
of spinning. Daily Sun was at
the arena to capture stunning images since believing is seeing.
