“THE wake-up call for me should have been the day a bullet blew my hat off.” These were the words of Mussolini Shumi, who has managed to stop drinking thanks to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He told Daily Sun he sometimes couldn’t believe he was still alive after all the drinking and criminal activities he was involved in. Speaking about the day he almost lost his life, Mussolini said: “We were coming back from a soccer match between Chiefs and Sundowns when we decided to rob a guy. “There were four of us and we thought he was an easy target because he was with a woman. “As we tried to grab him, he pulled out a gun and fired at us. The first bullet hit my friend and severely injured him. “We scattered all over the place and he kept on shooting. I felt my hat leaving my head as it was hit by a bullet. “Every time I think about that moment, I sweat a bit.” Mussolini said they later learned the man was a soldier. He said thanks to AA, he was happy to say he no longer lived a rough and dangerous life. To show his gratitude, Mussolini and some members of his AA group in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, will be holding a rally this Saturday. He said the aim of the imbizo was to spread the message to those still ruled by alcohol that there was hope for them. The imbizo will be held at Tsolo Hall on Makau Street from 9am. The venue is close to the well-known Change Bible Church. Mussolini, who has been sober for 10 years, said: “After being involved in two car accidents while driving a company car, I knew I needed help or I would die. “I decided to tell my employers the truth and was booked into rehab. When I came out, I joined AA and the past 10 years have been pure bliss.” Mussolini said anyone who thinks they might have a drinking problem should attend the event to find a solution.
