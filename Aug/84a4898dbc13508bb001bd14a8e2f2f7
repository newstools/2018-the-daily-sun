After months of intense battling in the courts and in the public eye, the Democratic Alliance has delivered the final nail in Patricia De Lille’s coffin. The Democratic Alliance has announced on Sunday that De Lille has resigned as Cape Town’s Mayor! The announcement was made by DA leader Mmusi Maimane in Cape Town, Western Cape. De Lille’s resignation will be effective from 31 October this year. The Democratic Alliance and De Lille have been embroiled in a bitter legal battle for months. The announcement was the final nail in the coffin. “This has been a long and difficult journey,” Maimane said. “This matter has already gone on for too long, and has sapped the energies and attentions of both parties from our core work, for which we apologise.” Maimane also said that the DA has taken a decision to withdraw all internal disciplinary charges against De Lille. However, Maimane said that any other investigations by the City of Cape Town are not covered by this agreement. “The DA acknowledges that the Mayor has led the DA’s government in the City of Cape Town since 2011, and has for the most part done so with distinction. “The team she has led has achieved four clean audits and has helped the City of Cape Town to its pre-eminent position as the leading metro in South Africa. “She has been a colleague, friend and loyal member of the DA for nearly a decade,” he said.
