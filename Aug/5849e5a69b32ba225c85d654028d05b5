AFTER yet another gang robbery in JB Mafora kasi, Mangaung on Friday, people were baying for the robbers’ blood. They launched a manhunt for two suspects on Saturday. Burning tyre necklaces then ate the alleged thieves alive! The two boys, believed to be members of the Maroma gang, were killed at a four-way stop. Residents told Daily Sun they’ve had enough of gangs causing chaos every weekend, only to be released without being punished if bust. One said: “I was sleeping, when I heard a whistle. I found people carrying sjamboks hunting for boys who robbed people. “One of them was cornered and sjambokked until he told us where his friend was. “After the friend was caught, they were stripped naked and forced to walk to a four-way stop, where they were beaten again before being burned to death.” Another resident said: “We wanted to make an example of them and send a message to their friends that we will not tolerate this behaviour. They rob old people and women.” The SunTeam spoke to the gang leader known as Master, who said: “We rob people because that is what we know. Our members were killed and we will get revenge. We are not scared of anyone. This is war.” Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said two counts of murder are being investigated. “The men are unknown at this stage but are thought to be between 16 and 18. “We urge people to stop taking the law into their hands as it stops successful investigation.”
