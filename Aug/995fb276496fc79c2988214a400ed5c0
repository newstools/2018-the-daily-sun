THEMBA Madonci (63) is one very angry madala! An insurance company has been fraudulently deducting money from his old age grant every month for the past two years. What is even worse is that madala Themba does not even know the beneficiary of the policy. Themba, from KwaNobuhle in Uitenhage, said an insurance company in Joburg had been deducting R90 a month from his social grant without his permission. “I never took out insurance with that company. I don’t even know Nomzamo Totomayo, the person who is said to be the beneficiary of the policy. “This is not good because I am supposed to get all my pension money every month. “I have a life policy with a different insurance company and the beneficiaries are my relatives.” Themba, who lives alone, said he had been to the Sassa offices several times, to ask officials to investigate and stop the deductions. “The only help I got from Sassa was a statement of my payments. “That is how I found out about the insurance company. They told me they could not do anything to stop the deductions. “I am angry with Sassa officials because they should have stopped it, since they are the ones who administer the payouts. “I showed them many affidavits stating that I did not take out a policy with that insurance company,” said Themba. He showed Daily Sun affidavits and letters he wrote to the insurance company, asking them to stop the deductions. “I phoned the company several times. “They promised to investigate, but nothing happened,” said the madala. “I just want the deductions stopped because I want my money back.” Provincial Sassa spokesman Luzuko Qina said he was looking into the case. “I directed the issue to our offices and they are investigating the case. “We have also contacted madala Madonci for more information.” The People’s Paper could not get comment from the insurance company at the time of going to print.
