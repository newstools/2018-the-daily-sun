A NEW R14,5 million state-of-the art library has been opened for the community of Masobye near Mmametlhake, Mpumalanga. The library was opened by MEC for Sport, Culture and Recreation Thandi Shongwe on Monday. Shongwe warned residents of Masobye not to destroy the information contained in the building. She explained that it would be helpful for generations to come. “This library is a very important institution for the people of this area. It will help them improve literacy. “The area did not have a library for a long time and school children struggled to get information. We need to guard the building as a community because it belongs to us and it is the future of our children.” “This library should not become the victim of your anger during service delivery protests,” she said. The MEC was accompanied by the local chief Kgosi Maloka waBakgatla ba Maloka. He said school children will now find it easier to get information for their studies. “Libraries carry knowledge and people must take the time to pick up a book and read it. “Reading opens the mind of a person. We are very lucky to have an institution like this one in our area,” he said. The library consists of a computer room, activity room, media room, play area for kids, study area and offers free internet and Wifi.
