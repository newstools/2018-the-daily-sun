MZANSI has taken to Twitter to express their thoughts after
the African National Congress announced that it would be "explicitly"
expropriating land without compensation. The governing party held a land summit in May where it
decided there was no need to amend the Constitution. The ANC said at the time that, many believed Section 25 of
the Constitution in its current form allowed expropriation of land without
compensation.
