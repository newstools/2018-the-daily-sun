A STUBBORN tokoloshe always makes Meshack Mphahlele do the opposite of what he wants to do. Meshack told Daily Sun: “When I drink beer the tokoloshe adds another round. I get so drunk I can’t remember anything.” The 56-year-old from Mamelodi East phase 5 in Tshwane said he was sick and tired of his miserable life in the shadow of the evil creature. “This creature first started ruling my life when I was still at school,” he said. “It led me out of an exam room while I was writing. “I tried to rewrite but the tokoloshe always took me out until I gave up. “Today, I don’t have a matric certificate and I’m uneducated.” Meshack said he had tried many times to open a bank account. “I go to the bank, but when it’s my turn to be helped by a bank consultant something drags me out,” he said. Meshack, who’s a community leader, said the tokoloshe now wanted to turn residents against him. “I was one of the speakers at a funeral on Saturday. I had a prepared speech but the tokoloshse took over. I apparently insulted the priests.” He said whenever he goes for interviews the tokoloshe makes him insult the interviewer. “I regain my senses when security guards carry me outside the offices,” he said. Meshack said he was afraid of what the tokoloshe would do to his wife and four children. “The tokoloshe makes me drunk, then makes me insult my family. I can’t live like this. I have been to churches, sangomas and prophets, but I don’t get help.” Sangoma Makgonatjohle Seaparo said Meshack has been bewitched “He has to be cleansed with goat meat in a river,” he said.
