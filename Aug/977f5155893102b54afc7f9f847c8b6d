THE Tshabalala family in Motlhabeng, near Mahikeng, North West is devastated by the death of baby Boitumelo (2). Boitumelo’s tiny body was discovered by her friend, Thato Moalusi (5) at a nearby house with her head stuck in a water drum. Gogo Belinah Khoba, whose yard the little girl died in, said children usually play with her grandchildren in her back yard. She blames the parents for not monitoring their children. The gogo says the drum is used for left-over food for pigs. “On the day the baby drowned, the drum was half-full of dirty water. There was a small container next to the 40 litre drum, which I think Boitumelo might have tried to use to draw water from the drum.” She said she and her nephew tried to resuscitate the baby before calling her mum, Meikie Tshabalala, but it was too late. “There was foam and food coming out of her mouth and she was motionless,” she said. Boitumelo was buried on Tuesday at Motlhabeng Cemetery in an emotional send-off. Her aunt, Tebogo Tshabalala, said her niece’s death was questionable and it will take long for them to heal as a family. Police spokesman Nico Dingoko did not respond to questions at the time of going to print.
