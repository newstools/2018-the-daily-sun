A VACANT piece of land previously used for illegal dumping has been transformed into a park. Deputy environmental affairs minister Barbara Thomson on Thursday opened Alfred Mkhize Park in Barberton, Mpumalanga. Thomson was joined by Mbombela mayor Sibusiso Mathonsi. The park was named after the first black mayor and principal in Umjindi. He became mayor at a time when the area only had white people in charge. The project entailed the fencing of the park, construction of braai facilities and pedestrian bridges, and the installation of playing equipment and park benches. The park has a sports fields, a nursery, amphitheatre an office and toilets. It cost the department R13,5 million to renovate the illegal dump. Thomson said the park was not meant to be used by young people who wanted to bunk school. She said it was meant to be a place for the community to rest and have fun. The MEC told the community to look after the park and ensure it was well cared for. “We know such places end up attracting people who want to do drugs. The department urges members of the community to refrain from doing those sorts of things here,” said the MEC. Gift Mkhize (50) said his family was happy the department honoured his grandfather. “We are happy this park was named after my grandfather, who was well known in this place.”
