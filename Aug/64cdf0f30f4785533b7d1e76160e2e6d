THE taxi driver lent a vehicle to his friend last week for him to go and earn some extra cash. But the friend became greedy and failed to return the taxi! When his boss demanded to know where the taxi was, he claimed he had been hijacked. They even opened a case of hijacking at the Ivory Park Police Station on Tuesday. As the cops were investigating, however, they realised his statements were contradictory. When he was interrogated on Wednesday, he confessed and told the cops what exactly had happened. He was arrested. The man, from Kaalfontein near Midrand, was arrested for alleged perjury after he opened a false case of car hijacking. Captain Bernard Matimulane said the 32-year-old suspect had been working as a taxi driver in Tembisa. “He claimed in a statement to have been hijacked by unknown people in Tembisa. “Investigations commenced soon after the case was opened and it soon emerged there was no hijacking that took place,” said Matimulane. He said there were discrepancies in the taxi driver’s statement because he was giving them the exact spot where he was hijacked and they could see that something was wrong. “When confronted, he admitted having fabricated a hijacking, and the actual story was that he borrowed the taxi from one of his friends and never returned it. “The suspect, fearing the fallout from his recklessness, cooked up a story, thus sending police on a wild-goose chase.” Station commander of the Ivory Park SAPS Brigadier David Ngcobo strongly condemned such behaviour. “Opening a false case is a serious offence and the police are going to treat this matter as such. We intend to deal with this matter in such a way that whoever plans to hatch these ideas will have to think properly before going ahead in future,” said the brigadier. Matimulane said the suspect appeared in the Tembisa Magistrates Court last Thursday and he will make his second appearance this coming Thursday.
