On Tuesday night, a former Mpumalanga teacher was honoured as the province’s best farmer during the Female Farmer Awards ceremony in Middelburg. Esther Mhlongo (58) left her teaching job in 2002 to farm and now owns 305 hectares of land in Barberton. She plants macadamia nuts on 100 hectares and employs more than 100 people, of whom 36 are full-time workers. Speaking at the event, which was attended by Agriculture MEC Vusi Shongwe and other dignitaries, Esther said there had been challenges but she pulled through. “I feel great and I’m looking forward to transferring my farming skills, especially to young women. “I want to stop supplying and start processing to make a lot of money.” She attributed her success to her being hands-on and encouraged women to use their hands to make money. Shongwe said the awards encouraged and increased women’s participation in agriculture.
