If the EFF decides to vote with the ANC in the upcoming motion of no confidence in Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga then, in terms of the numbers, the City will no longer be run by the DA. The Tshwane council is expected to sit on Thursday where two motions of no confidence in Msimanga have been tabled - one by the ANC and the other by the EFF. The motion tabled first will be put to a vote in the event that it isn't withdrawn. According to council numbers, which News24 received from a DA source, 203 out of the 214 seats are expected to be filled, which means there will be quorum and the motion can proceed. The numbers, if the EFF votes alongside the ANC to remove Msimanga, greatly lean towards the DA going back to the official opposition benches in Tshwane. According to the numbers, 82 of the 89 ANC councillors are expected to be present, 24 of the 25 EFF seats are expected to be occupied and all 93 DA councillors are expected to attend. The Freedom Front Plus, with its four members, as well as one COPE member - are also expected to attend the sitting, according to the source. Both parties are still in a coalition. If the EFF votes with the ANC, there are expected to be 106 votes in favour of the motion and 98 against. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/if-the-eff-votes-with-the-anc-msimanga-is-likely-to-be-axed-council-numbers-show-20180830
