COACHING a new club in the National Fist Division (NFD) is never an easy task to perform. Newly appointed TS Sporting coach Benson Mhlongo says he is prepared to face all the challenges that he is bound to come across in the NFD. Mhlongo, who needs no introduction in SA football having played for the likes of Orlando Pirates and now defunct Platinum Stars, left the Buccaneers last week to join the NFD rookies. He will be leading the Mpumalanga based outfit in the 2018-19 campaign with a wealth of knowledge and experience that he gathered from the likes Kjell Jenevret, Rulani Mokwena and Milutin Sredojevic during his stint as assistant coach at the Soweto giants. The 37-year-old, who also coached Pirates’ reserves last season, said he had a lot that he wanted to achieve, but the first thing was to ensure he had a strong team in the NFD. “As a new coach in the First Division I cannot make many promises. The league will humble you as we have seen many coaches fail to live up to expectations,” Mhlongo said. “Our main focus at the moment is to ensure we have a team that will be able to compete.” The NFD campaign is expected to kick-off on the weekend of 18-19 August and Mhlongo’s charges visit fellow mates Maccabi FC in their opening fixture at Dobsonville Stadium in Soweto on 18 August. Maccabi are also on their first stint in the NFD. The two sides were promoted after reaching finals of ABC Motsepe League national play-offs in Limpopo in June. In other NFD news, University of Pretoria, who were relegated from PSL at the end of 2015-16 season, confirmed that they have parted ways with Shaun Bartlett after he spent two seasons with the team. Bartlett will be replaced by Evangelos Vellios, who assisted him last season.
