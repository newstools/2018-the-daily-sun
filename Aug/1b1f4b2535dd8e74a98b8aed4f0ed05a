COPS have launched a manhunt for two suspects after a diamond dealer was attacked and robbed on Tuesday night. The 60-year-old was apparently approached by three men pretending to be clients interested in buying diamonds. Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock said the incident happened in Kimberley, Northern Cape. “On Tuesday at about 7pm three men approached a licensed diamond dealer about buying diamonds. “They posed as prospective buyers before pouncing on the victim in his office in Kimberley. “The suspects allegedly assaulted the victim, pointed a firearm at him and attempted to tie him down with cable ties. The business owner fought back and it ended up in a scuffle, with the victim in possession of the firearm. “He screamed and some of his workers came to his rescue. Two suspects fled with a substantial amount of diamonds and cash which they had stolen,” he said. Kock said a 32-year-old suspect from Gauteng was arrested. A revolver he had allegedly used in the crime was confiscated. “The Northern Cape crime unit are investigating a case of business robbery and the arrested suspect will appear in court soon. “If anyone has information regarding the incident and the suspects involved, please call Detective-Constable Tshiamo Mokwena on 081 530 5333 or contact your nearest cop shop,” said Kock.
