the two suspects were arrested and large quantities of dagga confiscated during
the intelligence driven operations. He said police followed up information that led them to
different locations where the arrests and confiscations were made. "In Groblersdal, a 30-year-old man was arrested and
large quantities of dagga with the estimated street value of R500 000 and sets
of different motor vehicles number plates were seized," said Ngoepe. He said preliminary police investigations revealed that
the suspect is supplying these drugs around Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces. Meanwhile, the Provincial Crime Intelligence and the
Detectives conducted a joint operation and successfully tracked down a 35-year-old  suspect dealing in dagga at the taxi rank
