HAVING a kind heart can sometimes lead to bad things. This is the tough lesson Nokuphiwa Vaphi (28) from NPA squatter camp in Umzinto, KZN learned on Tuesday. This after her two-month-old daughter Sbahle was kidnapped by a woman who pretended to need help. The baby’s father Mkhalelwa Nqoloda (36) said Nokuphiwa was standing with two friends at the taxi rank when she was approached by the unknown woman. “The woman called her aside and said she had been fired from her job before she was paid. She said she needed a place to sleep before she could make a plan to go home. Feeling sorry for her, Nokuphiwa took her to our place,” he said. Mkhalelwa said the woman complained of a headache in the evening and asked Nokuphiwa to get painkillers from the neighbours. She went to the neighbours, leaving her daughter with the woman. “When she came back, the woman and our daughter were nowhere to be seen. Nokuphiwa has been crying non-stop and regrets feeling sorry for a criminal,” he said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of kidnapping was opened and appealed to anyone with information to call the Umzinto cop shop on 039 974 6500/6556 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111. She said the police believe the woman got a lift to Durban after hitchhiking on the R612 near Courthouse Road. “We appeal to anyone who might have given a lift to a woman carrying a baby at about 9pm on Tuesday to contact the cops urgently. She is in her early 20s and was wearing a pink gown, blue denim jacket, a pair of black pumps and green and black skirt,” she said.
