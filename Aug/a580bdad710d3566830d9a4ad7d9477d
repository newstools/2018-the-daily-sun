YOU booze, you lose! This was proved on Friday when Eastern Cape cops clamped down on drunk drivers. The Eastern Cape Liquor Board said it was struggling to deal with the high number of illegal booze sellers, and as a result cops were called in to help clamp down on liquor-related crimes. Captain Andre Beetge said: “A roadblock led by women cops, known as Operation Basadi, was held on the N2 in Kinkelbos on Friday. “A 41-year-old man was arrested for drunk driving. He is expected to appear in the Alexandria court soon.” But DA shadow MEC for economic development, environmental affairs and tourism, Andrew Whitfield, blamed the provincial liquor board for these crimes. He accused the board of failing to employ enough liquor inspectors to monitor illegal and legal traders. He said: “Provincial alcohol-related crimes are being caused by the Eastern Cape Liquor Board. “The board has a huge shortage of liquor inspectors responsible for conducting effective monitoring and regulation of legal and illegal liquor traders. “It is alleged that many liquor traders do not comply with the liquor act. “It is these illegal outlets that allegedly cause the increase in crime. “I will find out from the Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs Department why these critical vacancies have not been filled and when they will be filled.” Mgwebi Msiya, a spokesman for the Liquor Board, confirmed there was a shortage of liquor inspectors. He told Daily Sun: “So far we have about 18 inspectors who have to service the whole province. “Their job includes identifying illegal liquor outlets and conducting blitz operations. “We are still trying to get the budget to employ more inspectors.”
