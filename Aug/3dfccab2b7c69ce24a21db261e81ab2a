GRANT Isaacs and his girlfriend, Mary-Ann Orlein, can now sleep peacefully. They claim a tokoloshe in the form of an old woman with one leg had been terrorising them in their shack on a plot outside Bloemfontein for seven years. The couple lost their dog, Chaowa, a year ago. Now they say Chaowa’s skull is protecting them from the evil tokoloshe. The couple believe that their dog was killed by the creature, since they found it with its intestines missing. Grant said they took the dog’s remains to a sangoma, who told them to hang its skull among other animal skulls in front of their shack. “We did not sleep peacefully for years. I used to hear something running on top of our roof, giggling. “When I went outside to investigate I saw a short, hairy old woman with one leg running away,” said Grant. “I did not believe in tokoloshes as I am Indian, but my girlfriend suggested we see a sangoma after our dog died, and I now believe there is evil.” He said it seemed as if the creature had disappeared since he hung the skull in front of their shack. “I believe my dog’s spirit is fighting for us,” Grant said. Mary-Ann said she used to date a sangoma before she met Grant. “He used to threaten to curse me if I left him. I believe the creature was sent by him, as he did not want me to see other men,” said Mary-Ann. She said they consulted a sangoma after she learned he had moved to another province and could not ask him to stop his evil deeds. “Even though my boyfriend and I sleep peacefully, our eight-month-old baby boy is still troubled by the creature. “He cries for no reason at midnight,” she said. Sangoma Kingsley Maboa said: “A tokoloshe can be chased away by an animal skull that has been worked with muthi. The family need to cleanse their yard.”
