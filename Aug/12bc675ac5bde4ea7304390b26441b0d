ONLY a catastrophic slip-up would stop Glenrose Xaba from winning the 2018 Spar Women’s 10km Grand Prix Series. With two races to go, Xaba has a healthy 14-point lead on second-placed Kesa Molotsane in the overall standings and appears to be in a great position to clinch her maiden Spar Grand Prix win. Xaba finished second in the Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban races. Then the 23-year-old Boxer club runner struck it lucky in Pretoria where she won with an impressive time of 33:56, becoming the first person this year to earn bonus points. She goes into the fifth race in Pietermaritzburg on Sunday very high on confidence. “There are two races left and there is still some work to do,” said Xaba. “The biggest challenge for me now is Kesa. She is a strong competitor. But I’m focusing on my own race, trying to maintain consistency in my performances. I have to keep doing what has been working for me since the first race. “This is the third time I’m competing in the Spar Women’s Race and winning the series would mean a lot to me. “I’ve always watched the likes of Irvette (van Zyl) winning the series before and always believed I could do better than them given the opportunity.” Third and fourth in the overall standings are the Zimbabwean pair of Rudo Mhonderwa, and Rutendo Nyahora. Van Zyl is on the comeback trail after giving birth but may not have enough races left to mount a serious threat to the runaway leader. The race starts and ends at the Pietermaritzburg Oval on Princess Margaret Drive outside Maritzburg College. “Because the Oval is next to the river, you start uphill and end downhill,” said Grand Prix director Ian Laxton. “It is an interesting route, but not an easy one.”
