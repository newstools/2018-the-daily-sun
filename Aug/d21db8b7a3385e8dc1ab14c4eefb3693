Outgoing Mayor of the Mother City Patricia De Lille is
gunning for fellow councillors and parliamentarians in the DA. She has her eyes set on 12 people that she accuses of
defamation. De Lille revealed this in a recent interview with 702 (6
August), when she said that she was “not finished with them yet.” De Lille and Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane
announced on Sunday (5 August) that De Lille will be stepping down from the
mayoral seat in October. De Lille said that all she wanted to do from the
beginning was to clear her name. “There are some people in the DA who are out to destroy
my name,” she said. “All kinds of allegations came up which they could never
prove because they will never be able to produce the evidence.” De Lille has been battling the DA in courts and in the
public for months. She said that she has a number of civil litigation cases
lined up. She said that the 12-strong list has two members of
parliament including the DA’s deputy chief whip, Mike Waters. She also said that there are six councillors on the list. She also slammed DA’s second deputy Chairwoman of the
Federation Natasha Mazzone for the remarks against her. “Some of these politicians would only speak because they
like to hear the sound of their own voices—they must stop talking." De Lille also challenged Mazzone to provide the
information of the allegations she has raised against her.
