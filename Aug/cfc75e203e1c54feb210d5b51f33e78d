The thugs thought they had hit the jackpot when they blew up an ATM machine. But to their surprise, the ATM didn’t have any money in it and they fled. Residents of Maphotla Village near Siyabuswa told Daily Sun the explosion was so loud it shook the walls of their houses. Selina Mthombeni (54) said when the explosion took place on Thursday night, she had no clue what was happening. “I thought the world was coming to an end. I was fast asleep when this happened. “I felt my bed shaking and the house sounded as if it was going to crumble. I couldn’t go back to sleep. I was scared.” Mpho Mahlangu (39) said the bombing had made the community feel unsafe. “We never thought thugs would attack an ATM in an area such as this one,” he told the People’s Paper. He said the thugs left the ATM in a shambles. “The machine helped us as a community as we couldn’t afford to travel to the mall to get cash. Now that it’s broken, we’re forced to take taxis to the mall just to withdraw money.” Police spokeswoman Captain Zandile Gqawa confirmed that no money was taken. She said a case of malicious damage to property was opened. Cops were investigating and no arrests had been made.
