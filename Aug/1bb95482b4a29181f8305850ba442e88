THE family of a boy who drowned while trying to cross Mhlathuze River last weekend said they were relieved that his body was recovered. Dumisani Sithole (17) from Mzingwenya Village outside Empangeni, northern KZN drowned last Sunday while trying to cross the river with three friends. According to his brother, Sicelo Sithole (24), the four were going to fetch sugarcane from the other side of the river when the incident occurred. “Crossing over the river was a quicker way to get to the sugarcane field. There is another way which they could have used but it’s longer.” He said Dumisani’s friends told them that they saw him disappearing under the water as if something was pulling him. “They said when they tried helping him up, they also felt like they were going to drown so they ran back to the river shore,” said Sicelo. He said they had been sitting near the river since Sunday while the divers looked for his body. “It took them several days to find him even though they saw his body stuck in the mud deep in the river. “They could not go in to fetch him because the river has crocodiles,” said Sicelo. He added that they were happy that his brother’s body was finally recovered. “Even though it’s painful that he died in this manner, it would have been more painful if we could not bury him. Now that his body has been found, at least we will find closure, knowing where his final resting place is,” said Sicelo. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “The body of a 17-year-old boy was found on Thursday by the search and rescue team. An inquest docket was opened at Esikhaleni cop shop.”
