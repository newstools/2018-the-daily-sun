HARD times have come for residents of Hankey and Patensie after water restrictions started on Monday. Kouga Municipality’s mayor, Horatio Hendricks, said the Kouga Dam, which supplies the Eastern Cape towns, is below 7% of its capacity. “We have been trying to delay water-shedding but the situation is critical and we cannot avoid it any longer. Hankey and Patensie have been using more than their allotted quota, adding to the urgency. We know it will be a difficult adjustment for the affected communities, but we ask that they bear with us,” he said. “This measure is necessary to help keep water in the taps for as long as possible.” He said water would be switched off for most of the day, seven days a week. “On Wednesday and Saturday water will be available from 4:30am to 11am and from 4pm to 8pm. On the other five days, water will be available only from 4:30am to 8am and from 4pm to 8pm,” said Hendricks. However, the mayor said the municipality’s borehole programme showed promise. “We struck water at Zuurbron near Hankey, as well as near the Kouga Dam, and we expect to have the full test results this week,” he said. Hendricks said if it did not start raining soon, Hankey and Patensie would have no water by October. A citrus farmer, who would not give his name, said he had no choice but to retrench workers. “This was a bad year for us because we did not harvest much fruit. There was not enough water to irrigate the plants. I will retrench most of my 120 workers and will rehire them when there is enough rain,” he said.
