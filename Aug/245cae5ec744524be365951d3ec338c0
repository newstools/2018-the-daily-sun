TEBOGO Finger gave uniforms to 10 needy pupils at Toka Primary School on Wednesday. The 47-year-old from Phahameng kasi in Mangaung, Free State is the owner of Shanel Trading Security Services. He said he decided to make the donation at the Freedom Square school because he loved working with the youth. He said he liked to help people who couldn’t find jobs by training them as security officers and placing them in learnership programmes. “My passion is to see other people succeed in life, and I love helping anyone who needs it. My heart hurt so much when I saw pupils walking to school with torn uniforms,” he said. “I decided with the little I had to help, I would identify about 10 pupils to give uniforms. On Wednesday, I managed to put some money aside and bought uniforms. “I’m glad I was able to put a smile on the faces of 10 pupils. I felt so great after I delivered them.” Parent Maria Mosia said: “I would like Tebogo to keep on doing good. “The good Lord will bless him more.”
