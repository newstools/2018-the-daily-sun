THE 21-year-old woman who is the only survivor of a massacre at her family home on Monday, said she doesn’t see herself continuing to live in the house. “I believe I am alive because I was in the bath at the time. I’m certain that if I’d been in the sitting-room with the rest of the family, I would have been killed as well.” The woman, who asked not to be named, said a gunman entered their home in Clermont, Durban and shot Thandazile Phungula (50), her son Lungelo (16) and her daughter Nqobile (12). She said Thandazile and Nqobile died at the scene, while Lungelo succumbed to his injuries in hospital. She said she is going to leave the house for good after the funeral. “No one could carry on living in this place after such an event. I don’t know who the killer is, but it is obvious he is out to finish us off. It would be stupid of me to continue living here.” She said she is waiting for the cops to catch the killer so he can explain to the court why he killed her family in such a brutal way. KZN police spokesman, Lieutenant- Colonel Thulani Zwane said it is alleged that on 20 August at 9pm, a family was attacked at their home in Clermont by an unknown man. “The 50-year-old mother and 12-year-old daughter died at the scene, while the 16-year-old son succumbed to his injuries in hospital. Charges of murder were opened at KwaDabeka cop shop,” said Zwane.
