THE DA says if councillors vote against the mayor, it is prepared to take the opposition benches in Nelson Mandela Bay. This comes as opposition parties in the city try again to get rid of mayor Athol Trollip. He has survived two motions of no confidence. Together, the ANC, EFF, UDM, United Front, African Independent Congress and Patriotic Alliance hold 61 of the 120 seats. Speaker Jonathan Lawack said a special council meeting is set for Friday to debate Trollip’s future and that of chief whip Werner Senekal. The council will also debate the issue around dissolving the deputy mayor’s post. DA provincial leader Nqaba Bhanga said: “The news that a new coalition arrangement was reached to move a motion of no confidence in the mayor does not distract us from our work. “Any opposition party that seeks to hand the reins back to the ANC is not putting the people of this city first. They are putting themselves and their narrow political interests first.” Bhanga said the DA, along with its coalition partners, will keep serving the metro’s people, even if the opposition would like to see the municipality collapse under ANC corruption. “If parties wish to vote out the coalition government, we will keep working for the people of the city, even on the opposition benches.” UDM regional leader Mongameli Bobani said: “We have lost faith in the DA-led coalition and Trollip. We will bring change to the city. He won’t survive this time.”
