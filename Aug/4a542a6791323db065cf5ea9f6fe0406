ANGRY residents of Mphambo Village attacked a police captain and destroyed six cop cars on Saturday. The people of the village outside Giyani, Limpopo were furious as they believed cops had shot and killed a community member. They claimed Dennis Hlungwani (37) was shot several times earlier in the day by a warrant officer. The officer, who is attached to the public order police in Giyani, fled after the incident but was later arrested. The attack on the police was condemned by provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba. He said incidents of mob attacks were still common in some areas of the province, especially Giyani. “Community members are warned to stop taking the law into their own hands as this practice continues to destroy the spirit of community policing.” Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the suspects who assaulted the police captain and damaged state property had not yet been arrested but cops were in the process of identifying them. “The police in Malamulele opened cases of murder and malicious damage to property. “The warrant officer involved in the murder incident has since been arrested,” said Ngoepe. “The motive behind the incident is not yet clear at this stage but ongoing investigations by the police and Ipid will tell. “The injured police captain was treated and discharged from hospital.” He urged anyone with information which could lead to the arrest of the suspects involved in the attack on the police to come forward. Ngoepe said they could contact Captain Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111. They can also SMS Crime Line on 32211 or visit their nearest police station.
