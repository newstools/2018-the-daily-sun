ORLANDO Pirates midfielder Musa Nyatama says they have put their shock exit from the MTN8 Cup behind them to focus on their Absa Premiership campaign. Pirates lost to defending champions SuperSport United on penalties in the MTN8 first round at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. Nyatama said they have turned their focus to their league clash with early pacesetters Bidvest Wits at the same venue tomorrow (7.30pm). Said Nyatama: “This was a big loss for us. A team like Pirates want to win everything but unfortunately we didn’t get through to the MTN8 semifinals. It’s a process to win games, we have to go through it to reach our target.” He added: “The team played well, penalties can go either way. We didn’t convert our chances on the night. But we hope to improve in our next game.” Nyatama was rested on Saturday as coach Milutin Sredojevic spared him for the hectic schedule ahead. “The team comes first, it’s not all about Musa,” said Nyatama. “Whoever is given a chance, we have to support him.” But the 30 year-old is aware they have another mammoth task ahead, considering the Clever Boys are on fire, having scored six goals in two league games. Wits thrashed Free State Stars 3-0 in their opening match and followed it up with a 3-1 hammering of Kaizer Chiefs last week. Explained Nyatama: “Wits started well and are a team to watch this season. I cannot single out any specific department where they are strong – they play as a unit. We have three players (Vincent Pule, Ben Motshwari and Xola Mlambo) from Wits and they will be eager to make an impact. They know how their former team plays. We will listen to them and the coaches on how best we can win the game.”
