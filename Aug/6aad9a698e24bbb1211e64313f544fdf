The risk of Stage 1 rotational load shedding remains high for Wednesday evening but will only be implemented if absolutely necessary, Eskom has said. While the power utility did not implement load shedding on Wednesday morning, the electricity system remained constrained with a high probability of Stage 1 rotational load shedding between 17:00 and 21:00 as a result of industrial action which continues to impact operations at Eskom's sites, it said in a statement. The state-owned company would meet at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) later on Wednesday to attempt to resolve the impasse, it added. "We are hopeful that all parties will put South Africa first as we endeavour [to find] an amicable solution." ...But plan for load shedding Eskom said the South African Police Service (SAPS) would continue to maintain order and enable safe access to power stations, as these are National Key Points. It would advise if load shedding would take place in either stage 1, 2, 3 or 4, depending on the capacity shortage. "We encourage residents and businesses to please use electricity sparingly to ease the demand of electricity. Please switch off geysers during the day, especially during peak periods (05:00 to 10:00 and 17:00 to 22:00), as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand," Eskom said. Customers should "plan on the assumption that load shedding will take place", the statement added.
