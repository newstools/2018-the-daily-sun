Cops said the suspect would join his alleged accomplices for a trial in the Pretoria High Court from 8 to 19 October. Four of the suspects were arrested last year, while a fifth died during a robbery. Police said all the suspects were positively linked to five cases: Masilela’s murder, three hijackings and possession of a stolen cellphone. Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange commended the officers who worked to make sure the suspects were arrested. “This arrest will go a long way to ensuring violent crimes in Gauteng are reduced,” she said.
