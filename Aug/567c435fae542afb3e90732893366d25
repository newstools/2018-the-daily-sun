THE Zokufa family from Nkandla squatter camp in Philippi East is worried. They are pleading with SunReaders to help them find a man they believe took their two-year-old son on Sunday afternoon. The child’s mum, Siphesihle Zokufa (24), said she had a fight with her cousin’s boyfriend, Mzimhle Jikwana, before her son disappeared. “I confronted him about disrespecting my cousin’s mum.” While they were arguing, Siphesihle’s son was playing with other kids outside but 15 minutes later, when she went outside to call him, he was nowhere to be found. “I was told that my cousin’s boyfriend took my son. I then remembered Mzimhle told me I would see what he’d do,” she said. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said cops were investigating a case of abduction of a boy who went missing on Sunday. “Anyone with information about the whereabouts of Mzimhle should call 073 395 6956 or 08600 10111.”
