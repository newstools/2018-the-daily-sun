Last night, Orlando Pirates’ striker Thamsanqa Gabuza did the unthinkable. After forcing a Baroka FC defender to commit an own goal he just went crazy. Gabuza’s strange celebration left many people scratching their heads. He took off his jersey and threw it at his own booing fans before he stormed off the pitch just before half time. In the process he gestured the substitution sign towards the fans. In the second half, Gabuza returned to the pitch unable to walk properly with ice strapped to his upper leg due to an apparent knee injury. But the no nonsense referee red carded him for taking off his jersey and for faking injury. All the while Black Twitter was watching. Fast-forward to today we now have the #GabuzaChallenge! Gabuza's actions certainly gave rise to this new challenge, in which social media users are seen imitating him. Even before the #GabuzaChallenge was initiated, seasoned Tweeps were already predicting that such a challenge would surface. And these prophetic Tweeps were right, as video after video started rolling into social media.
