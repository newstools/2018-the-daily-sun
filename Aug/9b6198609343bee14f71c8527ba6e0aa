Another Khayelitsha school has been targeted by criminals. Thugs broke into Sosebenza Primary School’s kitchen in Site B on Thursday. They stole a gas stove, a gas cylinder, food and cooking pots used for the school’s feeding scheme. The burglary happened just three days after Sanco leader Zonisele Bozo, residents, teachers and pupils marched to Cape Town. They were demanding security at schools after several burglaries and shootings. They handed over a memorandum to Premier Helen Zille and told her they were gatvol. Khayelitsha Development Forum chairman Ndithini Tyhido said something needed to be done urgently to fight crime in the area. “What’s happening angers us because most of the pupils come from disadvantaged homes and depend on the meals provided at their schools,” said Thyido. He said residents should come together to fight the scourge by not buying stolen goods. SGB chairman Thokozani Ncayiyana said: “It was an easy job for the thugs. We’re tired of demanding the same thing. “I don’t know what we must do for our schools to be prioritised. “Black schools also matter. We will have a meeting with the premier and the Khayelitsha Task Team next Monday.” Bronagh Hammond, provincial education spokeswoman, said the feeding scheme couldn’t operate after the equipment was stolen and they were running around to ensure things went back to normal. “It’s extremely sad that these pupils have been directly affected by this criminal activity. The security gate was also damaged,” she said. Parent Daluxolo Sikiti (45) said: “This worries us as parents because our children are not safe at school anymore.”
