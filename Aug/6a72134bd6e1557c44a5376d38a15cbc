THE ambition of taxi drivers to start their own political party is gaining speed. A meeting in Bruma, Joburg, last Friday again drew much interest and drivers and taxi owners vowed to support them. The Alliance for Transformation for All said if things went well, they could be contesting next year’s general elections. And with hundreds of thousands of taxi drivers in the country as possible supporters, the alliance could soon park in parliament’s seats. Co-ordinator Mzoxolo Dibela said they already had massive support in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape and were spreading out to other provinces to woo more taxi drivers and owners. “We have nearly 750 000 taxi drivers in the country, and if they buy into the idea we could end up in parliament fighting for their rights. “It has become clear to us that no one will address the taxi industry’s dire state of affairs but the industry itself,” he said. Dibela said Santaco wasn’t not doing enough to address these problems. “We’re not trying to undermine Santaco, but it’s not doing enough. “We struggle with permits. Our industry is not subsidised. Santaco has failed to deal with taxi violence.”
