FOR 10 years, Ntsoaki Khabele had to deal with the fact that her son’s murderers were never punished. Eventually, she realised that by helping others, she could work through her own pain. In 2016, the 58-year-old from G section in Botshabelo, Mangaung, opened a shelter for the elderly called Fadimehang Old Care with money from her own pocket. She told Daily Sun: “I started the centre because I realised there were a lot of old people not coping at home. I wanted to give them an opportunity to enjoy life.” Ntsoaki said some of the elders were victims of abuse but unlike her, they had not been given the opportunity to speak to a therapist. “At the centre, they take part in activities like sewing and sport and they are given a hot meal before going home for the evening. Ntsoaki found sponsors and volunteers to work at the centre while she’s at work. “I don’t charge the elders anything as I have made a commitment to help them so they can have a good life,” she said. Madala Neo Ramaoto (72) said he learned about the centre from his wife Morongoe, when he found she vanished from home twice a week. “I thought maybe she was bored with having me around. After asking her where she was spending her time, I was overjoyed at the news and decided to join her.” Gogo Betty Matsipa (83) said going to the centre gave her peace of mind. “As we exercise twice a week using high tech machines, my legs are no longer stiff and my chronic diseases have stopped bothering me.”
