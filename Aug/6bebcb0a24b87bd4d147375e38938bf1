BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic defender Lorenzo Gordinho could be back at Kaizer Chiefs as early next week. This is after his parent club sent a letter to Celtic, requesting his release from a loan spell, Amakhosi confirmed yesterday. According to the club, Gordinho joined Phunya Sele Sele in January for a negotiated period of 12 months. The centre-back appears to have caught the eye of new coach, Giovanni Solinas, in the two league matches Celtic won. Gordinho is also keen to go back to Naturena due to the unsettling financial situation Celtic. “The player also made a request to return to Chiefs after the reported problems the club has been going through,” said Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung. Gordinho was a regular feature in the Chiefs starting line-up. That, however, was before he suffered a broken rib. Surprisingly, he was loan out to Celtic on his return. Motaung added that that the Soweto giants were in talks with Kenyan Premier League side Gor Mahia over a possible transfer of Ugandan defender Godfrey Walusimbi. “The two clubs are in discussions and we hope to finalise the matter in the next few days,” Motaung confirmed.
