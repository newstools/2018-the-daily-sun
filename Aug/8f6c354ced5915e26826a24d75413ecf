ALI GULE, the activist who famously marched against corruption wearing a makarapa against state capture, says he hopes the current commission of inquiry isn’t another waste of money. Gule and three other picketers were outside the building in Parktown, Joburg, where the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture opened yesterday. “We hope this commission is not just a futile exercise. We are also hoping this is not just an exercise for formality,” he said. “At least the president has given a commitment that this time it will be different. What makes this one more important is that it involves former president Jacob Zuma.” He said he was from the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse and the organisation had always been involved in the matter. Gule said the commission was very important as it involved taxpayers’ money. “We think if the holes of corruption can be closed, a lot of improvement can happen, especially given that South Africa has a lot of unemployment,” he said. “We are very concerned about the abuse of tax money in various forms of corruption. “This is one of the biggest that has happened since the Arms Deal. The fact that it involves the former president makes it even more significant, more so because the international community is watching what happens. Investors will not invest in a place that is not stable, a place full of corruption. “What we are saying is the money could be used for other things. Students need financing for university.” Gule said while hospitals and clinics didn’t have medication and roads were bad, money was being stolen and the government complained there wasn’t enough funds.
