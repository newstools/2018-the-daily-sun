Bafana Bafana forward Phakamani Mahlambi is set to make a Premier Soccer League return after his club Al Ahly confirmed his transfer agreement. Mahlambi will join Absa Premiership reigning champions Mamelodi Sundowns after just one season with The Red Devils, with whom he signed a four-year deal in September last year to become the first South African to move to Egypt. Downs coach Pitso Mosimane also earlier confirmed that the Tshwane giant have been in discussions with Al Ahly, but said the transfer fee had been one of the main stumbling blocks during negotiations. The Brazilians have since forked out $900 000 (R13,2-million) for the 21-year-old, with Wits receiving in excess of R4-million due to a sell-on clause in the deal that saw him move to Cairo.Al Ahly, meanwhile, have also made it clear that Mahlambi is not to set foot back in Egypt, having included a $1-million (R14,7-million) fee should he join a rival Egyptian Premier League club in the future.The former Absa Premiership Young Player of the Season will now be hoping to rediscover his form following a unstable stay at the eight-time CAF Champions League champions that saw him manage one goal and five assists in 15 appearances.
