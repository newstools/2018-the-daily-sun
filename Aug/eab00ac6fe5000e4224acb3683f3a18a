DJ and music producer Sun-EL Musician has paid his dues. His collaboration with Samthing Soweto produced one of the biggest local tracks to date, and he’s not showing signs of slowing down. He recently worked with international artist Alicia Keys and her husband Swizz Beatz. Locally, he’s produced hits for some of the biggest names – Bucie, Zakes Bantwini and Thiwe, just to mention a few. If things go well at the Dance Music Awards South Africa next month, he’ll collect more awards. Earlier this year, he scooped three of the biggest at the Samas for his hit song Akanamali. “It’s always an honour to be acknowledged for something I’m really passionate about; my music. “I’m really humbled by this. Ngiyabonga.” Born Sanele Sithole in KZN, he’s been nominated in the Best Music Video category for his single Sonini, featuring Simmy & Lelo Kamau, and Album of the Year for his debut Africa to the World. The City of Ekurhuleni will host an honorary ceremony on 26 September at the Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg, Joburg. Apart from Sonini, his album has songs such as Sengimoja, Life We Live, No Stopping Us, Goodbye, Umalukatane, and Ntaba Ezikude. Dance Music Awards South Africa rep Kyle Worde said they had a total of 20 categories this year. “The public response has been phenomenal, with almost double the number of votes than last year. “We’ve already seen a huge increase in social media interaction this year,” he said. Kyle said several of the artists had played a big role in encouraging fans to vote. Other nominees include DJs Shimza, Lady Sakhe, Black Motion and Londie London. Voting will be driven by social media and online interaction via the official website, meaning no panel will dictate nominees. With the fully transparent user voted award process, this gives the public the power to choose the award winners. It closes on 19 September.
