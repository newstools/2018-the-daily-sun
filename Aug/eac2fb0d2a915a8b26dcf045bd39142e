MORE THAN 3 000 pieces of military equipment including
guns, swords and grenades believed to date back to World War II have been found
buried at a Tokyo primary school. On Monday, officials announced that construction workers
found the weapons last month when they excavated the grounds of Tanashi
Elementary School in the city of Nishitokyo in metropolitan Tokyo to build a
new storehouse. The weapons included 1 400 firearms, 1 200 swords, eight
grenades and 302 bullets. "We were totally surprised to be informed about the
discovery," said Masaki Fujisawa, a city official. "The items are all
rusted away and nothing can be used anymore." "I suspect they were buried during or after the war
but we will investigate the case," Fujisawa told AFP. News reports said the weapons may have been discarded
after Japan surrendered in 1945. Unexploded bombs and weapons are still occasionally found
in Japan, more than 70 years after the conflict ended.  https://www.news24.com/World/News/thousands-of-guns-swords-bullets-found-buried-at-tokyo-school-20180806
