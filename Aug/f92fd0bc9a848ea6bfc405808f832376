THE family of eight-year-old Vuthrari Sithole is heartbroken. Her body was found dumped near the Golden Highway. Little Vuthrari had been missing since the previous evening when she was found on Saturday morning. Police said they wanted to question 27-year-old Kulani Ngobeni in connection with the girl’s disapperance and death. Vuthrari’s relatives said she was last seen in the company of Kulani, who’s apparently a family friend. The family allegedly met the suspect some years ago after he’d lost his job. Vuthrari’s granddad Zwelakhe Nukeri (45) from Lehae, south of Joburg, said he then offered him a job in his business. Euphodia Nukeri (42), the girl’s gogo, told Daily Sun Vuthrari had been playing with other kids outside on Friday when she disappeared. When her grandchild didn’t come home later, she started to worry and asked the other kids if they hadn’t seen her. “I bumped into Kulani in the street on Friday afternoon and asked him if he had seen Vuthrari. He said he hadn’t seen her,” she said. She said she had continued looking and asking around. Cops confirmed that Vuthrari was raped and strangled. Soweto cluster spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza said cases of murder and rape were opened. “The whereabouts of the suspect are unknown,” he told the People’s Paper. “He’s known as Kulani Charles Ngobeni and is from around Tzaneen in Limpopo. “Anyone who’s seen the suspect is requested to contact their nearest police police.” SunReaders who have information about Kulani’s whereabouts can contact investigating officer Colonel Velaphi Majaja on 082 521 2907.
