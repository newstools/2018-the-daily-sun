“THUMA Qedani Mahlangu and Brian
Hlongwa to jail or we’ll Thuma you out of office in the next election!” This was what members of the
Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) said during a march to the Gauteng legislature
in Joburg on Tesday. They demanded that the ANC deal
with Mahlangu, who was health MEC when over 140 Life Esidimeni patients died,
and Hlongwa, who is accused of having been involved in massive corruption when
he was MEC.The protesters said it was
unacceptable that the provincial ANC elected both Mahlangu and Hlongwa to their
provincial executive committee during the party’s recent provincial conference. TAC secretary general Anele Yewa
said: “We are calling for Hlongwa and Mahlangu to be removed from the
provincial leadership of the ANC because they have dark clouds hanging over
their heads.  “For ANC members in Gauteng to
re-elect Hlongwa and Mahlangu, they are showing the middle finger to their
voters, to the families of the Esidimeni victims and the majority of the people
who are failed because of the collapse of the health system.”  Yewa claimed that Mahlangu was
responsible for mass murder, making her exactly like apartheid presidents PW
Botha and Hendrik Verwoerd, and must face the full might of the law. Jack Bloom of the DA in Gauteng
said corruption had been going on in the provincial health department for over
10 years. He said Hlongwa should have been jailed 10 years ago.  “The health department has never
recovered since what he did there. Following Hlongwa, we got Mahlangu and there
wasn’t just corruption there, she killed people. She was in charge and she
should be in prison,” she said. The protesters handed over their
memorandum to legislature speaker Ntombi Mekgwe, who promised to start the
process of dealing with the issues.
