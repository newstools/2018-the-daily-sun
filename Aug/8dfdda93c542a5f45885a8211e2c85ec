KAIZER CHIEFS officials and Siphiwe “Shabba” Tshabalala’s management team are treading carefully regarding the player’s imminent transfer to Turkish side Erzurumspor. Both camps are saying that for as long as there are no signed and sealed documents on the table, they’re not going to make any comments regarding the matter. To avoid disappointment, they want the matter finalised before they can jump into conclusions. Tshabalala, the former Bafana Bafana captain, will be turning 34 on 25 September and he is on the verge of making a switch to Europe. In 2010, Tshabalala was also nominated for the Fifa Puskas Award with his beautiful opening goal at the World Cup at FNB Stadium. News coming from abroad suggests that Erzurumspor are set to welcome the former Bafana Bafana player to the club in the next few days. According to KickOff, Erzuzumspor coach Mehmet Altiparmak has confirmed in Turkish media that a deal has been agreed on in principle, suggesting that the move is being finalised. Altiparmak was quoted as saying: “With Siphiwe Tshabalala we have a principle agreement. We will complete this transfer within the next few days. However, on Thursday, Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas said he could not comment on whether Tshabalala might be moving to Europe or not. In 2011, Tshabalala was set to join Nottingham Forest in June following a week-long trial at the City Ground, but Forest’s failure to win promotion via the play-offs and the subsequent sacking of then-manager Billy Davies saw the deal break down. If this deal materialises, Tshabalala will end his 11-year stint with Amakhosi as he returned to the Soweto giants in 2007 from Free State Stars. It also remains to be seen whether the player will feature for the Glamour Boys in the MTN8 semi-final first leg against SuperSport United this afternoon (3pm).
