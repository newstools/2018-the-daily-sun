ORIEL Maswanganyi can’t sleep at night since his nephew Chris (33) disappeared last month. The 54-year-old from Nephwe near Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said Chris left home while they were asleep. “Chris is mentally ill and would sometimes go to different hospitals looking for a girlfriend that doesn’t exist,” said Oriel. “Someone said he saw him at George Mukhari Hospital last month, and when we went there they said he was admitted but he changed his name.” He said Chris had disappeared before. “The first time he went to the local police station and asked cops for a ride. “We found him in Joburg after a week.” Oriel said they’d looked everywhere for Chris, but with no luck. Police spokesman Constable Herman Moremi confirmed that a missing persons case was opened. “We’re looking for him and cops are investigating,” he said. Anyone with information should call Daily Sun’s Tshwane office on 012 485 9213 or their nearest police station.
