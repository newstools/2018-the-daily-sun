THE R81 is a national road used by hundreds of motorists every day. The road passes through Ga-Sekgopo Village, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo. Many residents use it to go to work in nearby towns. However, the road has been a nightmare for the past few months as a huge pothole has formed on it. Motorists are now complaining that Sanral doesn’t care about their vehicles or lives. Jordan Sebelaolo (43), who uses the road to get to work in Polokwane every day, said he feared he would be involved in an accident. “The pothole has taken out a huge portion of one lane, which means two vehicles can’t use the road at the same time. “If you are in a hurry, you have to drive around the pothole on the gravel,” he said. Nhlamulo Baloyi (29) said: “An accident can happen at any time because some motorists are stubborn.” Many of the motorists said they tried to speak to the Greater Letaba municipal roads department about the problem but got no help. Sanral spokesman Vusi Mona said the section of the R81 had been experiencing problems and a tender had been awarded for a rehabilitation project. “Our maintenance teams have been keeping the road safe by doing pavement repairs, which includes patching potholes. “Unfortunately they had to stop work due to being confronted by protesting villagers. We advise motorists to contact the route manager with complaints or call our office on 012 426 6200,” he said.
