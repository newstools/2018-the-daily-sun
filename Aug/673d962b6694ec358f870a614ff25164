LIFE has come to a complete standstill for Potso Sepenya. He has been told he can’t come to school because he doesn’t have an ID. His mum was from Moruleng, North West, and married a Lesotho national while expecting Potso (26). She moved to Lesotho but came back to Mzansi to give birth to Potso at George Stegmann Hospital in Moruleng. She went back to Lesotho after Potso was born. She died in 2005 and Potso was sent to Sefikile near Rustenburg to live with his gogo and aunt. When Potso was in grade 11, the school principal told him he couldn’t keep him in the school without an ID. He asked his gogo and aunt to help him, but they were not interested. “I went to the Department of Home Affairs and they asked for different documents and letters from Lesotho. The hospital told me the old files were destroyed,” he said. “They asked for my mother’s documents. But no one can find them.” He is now stuck. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said: “The department has to, by law, satisfy itself before granting citizenship to people who claim to be citizens of South Africa. “In this regard, all the requirements have to be fulfilled to allow our officials to process the application.”
