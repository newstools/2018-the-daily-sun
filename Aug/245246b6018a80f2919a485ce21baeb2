Afrotainment Kingpin DJ Tira is responsible for catapulting a lot of artists to stardom through his record label. As a result, the record producer and Gqom music pioneer is often approached by prospective musicians when he is out and about. This time, DJ Tira, whose real name is Mthokozisi Khathi, had to shut down a young man who approached him outside his studio looking for an opportunity to work with him. The young man is a Hip-Hop artist, currently in Grade 8. DJ Tira adviced the young man to rather focus on his school work and come back at the end of the year with his report card, maybe then they would work something out. “Education first,” he captioned the video of the young man which he posted on social media. “Please let’s encourage our kids to finish school before pursuing a music career,” he pleaded with parents. People on social media were split over what Tira said to the young artist, some said talent is talent, regardless of age and they gave Cassper Nyovest as an example, who is a very successful high school dropout. Others were glad that Tira advised the young man to focus on school, emphasizing that education is the key to success.
