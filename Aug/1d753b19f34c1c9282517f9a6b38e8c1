HARD work has paid off for Nomzamo High School in Strand, near Cape Town. The school was recognised for achieving the most improved matric results in the province last year and was rewarded for being the top physical science performer without a laboratory. It received a donation including a projector, computer screen and printers. Driving past the school, a senior manager from Stone Three in Somerset West was touched by the difference between the high school and neighbouring private school Reddam House. He and his company decided to do something to help the school. Financial officer Amanda Tsupe said the company asked to partner with the school. “It is important for companies to support schools which get good results under difficult circumstances. “We liked what we saw at the school and wanted to help.” Principal Chris Mgubanto said: “We are really struggling with funding. I am happy and honoured by the donation.” Teacher Andiswa Ncinithwa said: “We can now display what we teach on the screen. The speakers provide sound for the videos we show the children.” Matric pupil Athile Boniswa (18) said now they can improve their results even more. “The equipment will help us with our projects and motivate us.” The school is also building a laboratory funded by the University of the Western Cape because of its good results last year.
