THE Bible is a guide for many people in Mzansi. But with all the stress placed on families with mothers and fathers, does being a single parent make a person feel out of place? The prevalence of single parents is the reason why an organisation called SheDad was formed a few years ago. Last weekend in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, SheDad launched a manhood coaching programme with Max Moyo, a keynote speaker and author of Become Yourself. He said: “You have a unique set of talents that change the world more than you thought possible.” Martha Shumba (34), founder of SheDad, told SunWellbeing: “We live in another generation where men are not or cannot be the fathers their children need. “We cannot keep teaching little girls that they, alone, are responsible for saying ‘no’ to sex without teaching little boys that actions can cause consequences that reach far beyond their own lives,” Martha said. Shumba started SheDad in 2016 to reach, coach and groom sons of single parents to become a force for positive change. It also works to end child marriage, crime and abuse. “Adults also cannot keep on thinking they are allowed to make dangerous or deadly decisions about the lives of children, just because they are adults. “When I was 13 years old I was married to an older man. I was abused by men and I called them ‘dogs’ out of anger. “But anger does not solve problems. Old dogs cannot be taught new tricks, but we can show children how to be better.” By mentoring children with positive role models, SheDad works to break the cycle of misery that produces more poverty.
