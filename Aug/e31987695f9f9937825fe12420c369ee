Supersport United striker James Keene has come to the defence of Orlando Pirates forward Thamsanqa Gabuza after his dramatic antics during his side’s PSL clash with Black Leopards at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday. Gabuza’s poor form in front of goal has led to fans growing increasingly frustrated with him. Fellow striker Keene, who is not having the best of time in front of goal himself, sympathised with Gabuza. “Really feel for Gabuza,” Keene said on social media, “Week in week out gives a 100% for the club & team mates. “He is going through a hard time as a player, we should get behind him and lift his spirits again. “Missed chances or not, he is a human being and a good footballer who doesn’t deserve to be treated this way.” A fed up Gabuza who was feeling the pressure from fans, left a lot of people puzzled when he took off his shirt and threw into the crowd after his cross led to an own goal that gave his side the lead. He then headed straight down the tunnel only to return in the second half to receive his marching orders from the referee for taking his shirt off and leaving the field of play without the referee’s consent.
