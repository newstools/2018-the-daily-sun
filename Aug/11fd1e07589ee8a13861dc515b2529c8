ABOUT 40 students slept outside the Elangeni TVET College on Thursday night! The students were seen waking up at the entrance to the Ntuzuma campus in Durban on Friday morning. They told Daily Sun they had slept at campus because they had been chased away from their rented rooms by their mastandis for not paying rent for three months. Sasco chairman Musa Nala (31) said the students were suffering because the college didn’t want to give them their allowances. “Their allowances help them pay rent and buy what they need to study. “We are aware the National Student Financial Aid Scheme gave the college the money but they are not giving it to the students,” said Nala. “The students who slept at the college are from places such as Empangeni and Nkandla, so they had nowhere to go after being chased away from their rooms.” Nala said after the college management was informed of the situation, they brutally chased the students away. A 24-year-old student said he was disappointed with how the college handled the matter. “We were supposed to get our allowances in April but we didn’t. We’ve been asking management why we’re not getting allowances but they’re not giving us reasons,” he said. College spokeswoman Buhle Zwane confirmed that some students had not received their allowances. She said this was due to things like students having given incorrect banking details. “College Rector Zodwa Aryetey, management and the SRC held a meeting where students were given the opportunity to seek clarity,” she said. Zwane added that they were given letters to give to their mastandis saying they would have the money by tomorrow.
