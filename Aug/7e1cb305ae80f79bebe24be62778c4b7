POLICE officers in Tzaneen and Letsitele, outside Bolobedu seem to be fighting a losing battle. Criminals target the areas because they are far away from cop shops. This prompted DA shadow minister of police Zakhele Mbhele to conduct an oversight inspection at the Tzaneen and Letsitele cop shops. He was accompanied by a delegation that included his deputy, Dianne Kohler Barnard. Mbhele said the party visited the stations because of the escalating crime rate in Tzaneen and Letsitele. “In the 2016/17 financial year, robbery and burglary at non-residential premises increased by 26% and 31% respectively. “To make matters worse, parliament revealed that Tzaneen Police Station is in need of 20 more patrol vehicles. “We are going to present the police station’s position to parliament in a bid to find solutions,” he said. Mbhele said the Tzaneen cluster has been identified as one of 40 priority regions where a rural safety strategy should be fast-tracked. The crime prevention programme seeks to make farming and rural communities safer. “However, the level of crime and lack of police resources in this area suggest the strategy is not being implemented properly,” said Mbhele. Tzaneen station commander Brigadier Thomas Shingange said he is troubled by the fact his cop shop serves 23 villages in the area. “Our building needs to be renovated. “We have six sectors that need one vehicle each,” said Shingange. Letsitele is half-an-hour’s drive from Tzaneen and has experienced an increased number of stock theft from game farms. Some suspect a syndicate is behind the crimes. Assault, poaching and cable theft are also big problems in the area.
