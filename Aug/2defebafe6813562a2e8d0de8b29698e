THE United States military, has developed a wheel that will
make easy to tackle different conditions. The wheel is called the Reconfigurable Wheel Track (RWT),
the wheel can transform from a round wheel to a triangle one, in a matter of
seconds. This wheel was developed by the Carnegie Melon University
National Robotics Engineering Centre, together with the US military. The wheel reportedly uses a thin rubber cover over a robotic
wheel. It was developed to be able to quickly change the type of
wheels a vehicle uses, for military vehicles needing a quick getaway.
