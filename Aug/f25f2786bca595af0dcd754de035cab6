A TEENAGER is lucky to escape with her life after a
friend shoved her from behind, sending her flying off an 18 metre bridge. According to The
Sun, Jordan Holgerson (16) slammed into the Lewis River below in Vancouver,
Washington on Tuesday. She broke five ribs and punctured her lung during the
horror fall. Itâ€™s not clear whether criminal charges will be brought
against her friend who pushed her.
