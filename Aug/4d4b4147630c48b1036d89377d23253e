THE Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) marched to the
Gauteng Legislature on Tuesday, demanding that Qedani Mahlangu be fired from the ANC Provincial Executive
Committee. TAC says it won't tolerate corrupt and negligent
politicians. “ANC stop protecting thieves and those responsible
for death and suffering.” Delivering the memorandum, TAC provincial
chairperson Fikile Mtsweni said the worst case of negligence which shook the
country is the Life Esidimeni tragedy. “Details of the extent of negligence were revealed
during the arbitration hearings led by retired Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang
Moseneke. As the painful arbitration hearings unfolded, families
cried and spoke about the suffering of their loved one’s undignified deaths,” Mtsweni
said. She added that the painful reality is that
substantial sums of money were involved and that in many cases the only explanation
for some of the implicated NGOs taking in patients that they were not qualified
to care for was greed.
