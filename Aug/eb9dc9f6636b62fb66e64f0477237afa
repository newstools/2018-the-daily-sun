SERETSE Maleka (62) is a broken man after his sister disappeared last Monday. The madala from Nellmapius in Mamelodi, Tshwane, needs help to find gogo Christina Maleka (72). He said Christina, on the day she left, had asked her daughter to make her a cup of tea and walked out after drinking it. She never came back. He said Christina always complained about living with her daughter in Mshengu, Atteridgeville. “She wanted to go home to Brits in North West, but we wouldn’t allow it.” He said it was not the first time that Christina had gone missing. “This is the third time she’s disappeared, and the longest.” They would usually find her after a day or two. But this time they had searched everywhere. “Some people said they saw her in a taxi going to town,” he said. His main worry was that Christinan had been in the area for only a month. “She’ll probably be scared to ask strangers for help,” he said. “I feel so empty, not knowing if she’s safe. I won’t be at peace until she’s found.” He asked SunReaders to help find Christinan, who was last seen wearing a red and pink blanket, a blue Pick n Pay jersey and a blue doek. If you know where she is, call 072 583 3981, or Daily Sun at 012 485 9251.
