RESIDENTS from Blaauwbosch in Newcastle, KZN are demanding decent toilets. They are tired of using buckets and going to the bush to relieve themselves. They said they were promised toilets and services inthe late 90s but never received any services, not even the basics. People say that for years, they have been using the bush to relieve themselves while waiting for the municipality to build toilets. They said they eventually got tired of waiting and built toilets themselves, but now those toilets are full and can’t be used anymore. Resident Xolile Breakfast (43) said they bought corrugated iron and affordable materials to build their own toilets. “We hoped the municipality would see our desperation but they turned a blind eye. They know the toilets aren’t safe because of the material used and because the people who built them weren’t experienced.” Another resident said they had tried to speak to the ward councillor several times but never got answers. “He told us to leave him alone because he used his own method to identify houses that needed toilets. “Only five households have received toilets. This waiting forever is sickening.” Newcastle mayor Makhosini Nkosi said the municipality is building pit toilets with improved ventilation. “Due to budget constraints, we cannot meet demand. We try our best not to leave any families behind. We’ll continue building toilets.”
