A PASTOR already suspended for being unfaithful to his
wife has been given the boot for allegedly making a married mum-of-four
pregnant. She then tragically died aborting his child. According to Punch,
the Christ Chosen Church of God in Benin City, Nigeria this week banished Ngbeken
Elvis (32) for his ongoing slutty ways. He had already been suspended because his behaviour was
destroying his marriage. A senior church official told Punch: ““The condition the church gave Elvis was clear; he was told
to go and reconcile with his wife. “What the church expected is that when you are suspended,
you should put yourself together, ask God for forgiveness and if you turn a new
leaf, something could be done about your reinstatement.” Instead, Elvis impregnated his new nyatsi, Mama Sarah,
while her husband was out of the country. Explaining what had happened, Elvis said: “It was when I
was posted to Okhokhugbo branch of the church and did not have a place to stay
that she told me to stay in one of the rooms. She was my (church) member. “She came to meet me in the room.” Elvis has apparently been arrested in connection with her
death, which is rumoured to have a connection to muthi. “I feel so bad. I do not have a native doctor (sangoma);
I do not have anything like that,” said Elvis. Cop spokesman, Chidi Nwabuzor, said that he had not yet
been briefed on the matter.
