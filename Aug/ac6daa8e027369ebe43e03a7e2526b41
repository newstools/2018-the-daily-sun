The Springboks came crashing back to Earth with a bang when they were well beaten by Argentina in their Rugby Championship clash in Mendoza on Saturday. Argentina won 32-19 after leading 27-7 at half-time.The Pumas, who were on the receiving end of a 34-21 defeat at Kings Park in Durban seven days ago, were, as expected, an entirely different proposition in their own back yard.Backed by a vocal crowd at helped at times by lax refereeing by Australian Angus Gardner, the home side managed to score four tries through wings Bautista Delguy (2) and Ramiro Moyano, and flyhalf Nicolas Sanchez who also landed three conversions, a penalty and a drop goal in an all-round top-notch performance by the pivot.South Africa replied with three tries by skipper Siya Kolisi and a brace by replacement wing Lionel Mapoe who came on early in the first half for an injured Makazole Mapimpi.Flyhalf Handre Pollard had another forgettable day with the boot, landing only two conversions.Argentina picked up their first four points of the tournament with their victory, while the Boks left-empty handed and remain on the five points they picked up in Durban.The All Blacks already have a five-point lead atop the standings after back-to-back victories over the Wallabies in Sydney and Auckland.Rassie Erasmus' record after six Tests now reads, won three, lost three.The tournament enjoys a bye next weekend, after which Argentina will travel to Nelson in New Zealand to play the world champion All Blacks (Saturday, September 8 at 09:35 SA time).Later in the day, the Wallabies and Springboks will face off in Brisbane at 12:00 SA time.Teams:Argentina15 Emiliano Boffelli, 14 Bautista Delguy, 13 Matias Moroni, 12 Bautista Ezcurra, 11 Ramiro Moyano, 10 Nicolas Sanchez, 9 Gonzalo Bertranou, 8 Javier Ortega Desio, 7 Marcos Kremer, 6 Pablo Matera, 5 Tomas Lavanini, 4 Guido Petti, 3 Juan Figallo, 2 Agustin Creevy (captain), 1 Nahuel Tetaz ChaparroSubstitutes: 16 Facundo Bosch, 17 Santiago Garcia Botta, 18 Santiago Medrano, 19 Matias Alemanno, 20 Tomas Lezana, 21, Tomas Cubelli, 22 Jeronimo De La Fuente, 23 Juan Cruz MalliaSouth Africa15 Willie le Roux, 14 Makazole Mapimpi, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Andre Esterhuizen, 11 Aphiwe Dyantyi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Warren Whiteley, 7 Siya Kolisi (captain), 6 Francois Louw, 5 Franco Mostert, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Malcolm Marx, 1 Tendai MtawariraSubstitutes: 16 Bongi Mbonambi, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Wilco Louw, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 21 Embrose Papier, 22 Lionel Mapoe, 23 Damian Willemse  -Sport24
