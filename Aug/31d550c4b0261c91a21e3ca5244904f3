SOMAZULU Stwayile (56) from Grabouw in Western Cape loves his four dogs. “These are not just dogs, they are my babies,” he said. “God gave me one child, but her mum never wanted me to see her. I got these dogs as my kids. “I live with them and they are my family,” said Somazulu. “I get hurt when I see people beating or stabbing dogs.” Somazulu said that when the mother of his child refused to let him see his kid, he asked God to give him other kids, but instead He gave him dogs. “I am not complaining, because they protect me. “When there are evil spirits around the yard my dogs bark non-stop, making different noise than normal times and I know that no one will come into my house without an invitation,” he said. Somazulu said he sleeps with the dogs in the house. “I am protecting my dogs because I have had incidents where some of my dogs were stabbed by unknown people. “I do not want to lose these dogs. They are like family to me.” His dogs’ names are Spinach, Sweetie, Pastor and Cabbage. “Pastor is very protective of the other dogs, while Cabbage loves attention and is in return loving,” Somazulu told Daily Sun. “Dogs deserve to be loved. I often encourage residents to treat dogs like their kids, because that is what they are to me.” Somazulu said he would love to have a wife who would cook for him and his dogs. “Maybe Daily Sun can help me find a woman who will look after me and my dogs. “That person should treat me and our animals with love.” His neighbour, Lindikhaya Mk- hwebana (36), said: “I love Somazulu’s dogs because they protect us too.”
