MANY coaches have a strong belief that experience is what a team needs in order to make impact in the National First Division (NFD). But Ajax coach Muhsin Ertugral seems to be sticking to his philosophy that he is known for in SA football circles, using youngsters in his team that will be contesting in the NFD this season. With that, Ajax will not be affected by the NFD rule, which states that clubs participating in the league should include in the team sheet for every match a minimum of five players who are both Under-23 and eligible to represent Mzansi and a minimum of two players of that age should be on the field of play at all times during a match. Ajax young squad boast with the likes of former SA junior national team players such as Thendo Mukumela (20), Yagan Sasman (22), Grant Margeman (20), Jody February (22), Keenan Abrahams (19), Sergio Kammies (20), Kiyaam Bull (18), Masilake Phohlongo (21), Morne Nel (22) and Brandon Petersen (23). On their first match against seasoned campaigners Jomo Cosmos last Sunday, Ajax won2-1. Muhsin has a couple of experienced players: Sbusiso Khumalo, Thamsanqa Teyise, Raymond Monama, Prince Nxumalo and Shu-Aib Walters. The Urban Warriors were relegated from the Absa Premiership last season with Platinum Stars who are now known as Cape Umoya United. Ajax finished at the bottom of the log and Umoya couldnâ€™t survive the promotion/relegation play-offs.Now they will face Umoya on Tuesday, it will be these two teams first ever meeting in the NFD. The First Division Cape Town derby takes place at Cape Town Stadium (3pm). Today (3pm), eight NFD teams will be in action.
