THEY know they’ll get sick if they drink dirty water, but they have no choice. Residents of Nkombose Village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, dig holes in the ground to reach spring water. Or even worse: they have to travel long distances to rivers that run through neighbouring villages. What else can they do? Their river has all but dried up. They said the one JoJo tank in their village only gets filled up once a month. Joyce Mhlongo (65) has lived in the area for 20 years and always hoped for communal taps. Mbali Hlatshwayo (21) said they added bleach to the dirty water to try and kill germs. “We get upset stomachs and rashes. We’re losing hope that we’ll ever get clean water.” Councillor Sandile Manqele said he was aware of the water crisis in his village, but there wasn’t much he could do. “Water supply is the responsibility of the uMkhanyakude Municipality. I’ve tried to engage with them. “Only two water trucks supply to 20 wards. This causes a problem for us,” said Manqele. Spokesman Mdu Dlamini said a contractor was appointed to install water pipes.
