SHE runs a tavern to make a living and her music invites customers in. But Mabel Mabote has lost her sound system. The 35-year-old from Skrepeng, near Laudium, Tshwane says Metro police stole her sound system at gunpoint. She claims cops arrived at her place and stole a laptop and her music system in April. She said she and her customers had guns pointed at them when they asked why the music system was being taken. “They told me to shut up or else they would take me as well. When I kept asking questions, they took my liquor licence,” she claimed. Mabel said her neighbours did not complain about the noise. “The complaints came from nearby Laudium. Every night they pray using loud speakers and we don’t complain. I’m being targeted because I’m a woman,” she said. “I’m trying to make a living because there are no jobs.” Mabel said she struggled to open a case against the Metro police. “Officers told me that I was ambitious to think that I could open a case against the Metro police. I complained to the station commander and a case was opened but no one was arrested. Two weeks after I opened the case, the Metro cops came again and took my home theatre system,” she said. Laudium police spokesman Constable Simon Chokoe said Mabel allegedly refused to sign for her fine. He said she was informed on the day to go to the Metro police offices to collect her music system. “A case of theft was opened. No one has been arrested,” he said.
