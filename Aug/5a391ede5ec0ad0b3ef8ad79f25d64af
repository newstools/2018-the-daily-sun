MPUMALANGA police seized drugs worth an estimated street
value of R3.3 Million. The joint operation involved the South African Police
Service, Department of Home Affairs (Custom Officials) and South African Revenue
Service. The police in Nelspruit were conducting a stop and go
operation when the seizure occurred. Cops stopped the car that was coming from Mozambiqueâ€™ into country. They searched it and upon attempting to search the engine
compartment, the driver said the bonnet is difficult to open. He allegedly pretended to be looking for a tool to open it
and in the process he disappeared. The team managed to open the bonnet at which point the
staggering discovery was made. The police have urged anyone with information that can help
the police in their investigation to contact Sergeant Danny Sanderson at 082
462 1817 or the SAPS Crime Stop number, 08600 10111.
