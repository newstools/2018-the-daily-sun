WHEN a heavily armed nurse tried to enter a hospital, the police acted quickly. The nurse was carrying a rubbish bag when he tried to enter Montebello Hospital in northern KZN on Monday but he left after security guards tried to search him. However, cops received a tip-off that the nurse was carrying weapons in the bag. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Nsuze police, the tactical response team and K9 unit members followed the nurse. “This resulted in the arrest of a 37-year-old man in the Montebello area and the seizure of two firearms, as well a number of rounds of ammunition. He was caught while entering his home,” he said. Zwane said a search was conducted and two AK-47 rifles with 60 rounds of ammunition were found. The nurse was immediately arrested and taken to Nsuze Police Station. “He was charged with possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. He will appear in the Maphumulo Magistrates Court soon.” Zwane said the firearms would be sent for ballistic testing to find out whether they had been used to commit any crimes. A 45-year-old from Nsuze said he suspected the nurse was planning to shoot someone at the hospital. He said: “Fortunately, he failed to gain entry. It’s a good thing police followed him and got the guns. These days, people with guns kill each other over small arguments.”
