THE FOOD and Allied Workers Union (FAWU) and other civil
organisations marched in the streets of Tshwane on Tuesday. The matchers proceeded to the office of Finance Minister, Nhlanhla
Nene, to demand his intervention against the sale of illegal cigarettes that
has flooded the streets of Mzansi. The workers marched under the theme #NotJustAJob and they
proceeded peacefully while carrying placards and chanting songs. They called for the government to act against the illicit trading
of tobacco products, claiming that it was threatening their jobs. They said that the tobacco criminals were making billions in
unpaid taxes by selling cheap and fake cigarettes. They called for the Minister to shut down the tobacco criminals. Adding to their grievances, they demand an immediate ban on cheap
cigarettes and other measures to drive enforcement. Union spokesman, John Dominique, said the fight of illegal trade
of goods was a fight for all as it affects everyone. “When we lose billions due to smuggled goods, the economy suffers
and jobs in the legal and tax industry are negatively impacted. “Illegal and fake products also threatened the health of smokers
because the manufacturers were not always safety compliant," he said. He said the only way to fight this crime was for the government to
take active stance with the people. "We need to fight this crime together," he said. FAWU Secretary General, Katish Masemola, said for the sake of
their jobs, for the sake of their health, he pleaded with the Minister to clamp
down any illicit trade. The marchers said other demands to the Treasury were an immediate
shut down of illegal suppliers.
