THE thugs tried to rob a man at the weekend – but they failed to do so after his friend called out for help. Lucas Radebe from Mamelodi East in Tshwane (28) told Daily Sun: “On Sunday four armed men travelling in a red Toyota Tazz ordered me to get into their car. “When I was about to get in, my friend called out for help and I managed to run away. The thugs then started firing shots at members of Maswika Social Club when they tried to help me. They then sped off.” On Monday the thugs came back to finish off what they had started, Lucas said, but gatvol residents caught one of the thugs and beat him to a pulp. A member of the club said they tried to help Lucas, but the thugs shot at them. Luckily no one was hurt. “The thugs came back the next day, but residents caught one of them and beat him up,” the club member said. Another resident said: “We are tired of being terrorised by young boys; that is why we decided to beat up that thug.” She said they had been reporting thugs to the cops, but nothing was ever done. Mamelodi East police spokesman Captain Michael Mbewe confirmed that a case of armed robbery was opened. “No arrests have been made yet. A case of pointing a firearm was also opened and investigations are under way,” said Mbewe.
