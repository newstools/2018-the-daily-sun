FROM league champion to benchwarmer! This is how Ben Motshwari sums up his frustrating spell at Bidvest Wits, where his joy turned to despair amid souring relations with coach Gavin Hunt. In a frank interview yesterday, Motshwari opened up about how Hunt practically shut him out of the team, apparently without clear reasons. This was on the back of the season in which the Students won their first ever league title in 96 years of existence. “It was a bit sad, winning the league and the next season you are on the bench,” said Motshwari, who has since joined Orlando Pirates. “It was surprising. I mean, we made history with that club, winning the league after 96 years. And all of a sudden you are not playing. “He (Hunt) is a guy who usually encourages you to work hard. But in the last season he never spoke to me. It was very emotional. “You know, with our previous coach, when you came back for pre-season, he’d welcome everybody. Everything starts on the first day he sees you, encouraging you to work hard. As a player you think he would embrace you and encourage you to continue where you left off the season before. You would know as a player that you are already part of his plans . . . “But that’s life. I couldn’t do anything about it. I just kept working and I’ve now moved on.” Motshwari would later watch from the stands as the newly crowned champions huffed and puffed, and ended up missing out on the top eight. On the few occasions he did play, he was moved from his usual midfield position to various defensive positions. But it didn’t kill his spirit. “I was committed to the team, even though I wasn’t playing regularly. That didn’t kill me. “It wasn’t easy to leave Wits. But at the same time sitting on the bench and not playing wasn’t for me. I thought it was time for change.”
