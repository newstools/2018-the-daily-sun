CONDOLENCES have been pouring in to former president Jacob Zuma’s family after yet another of his family members died. Busa Zuma (29), the son of the former president’s nephew Khulubuse, died at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital in Durban on Monday. According to a statement issued by family spokesman, Khulekani Ntshangase, Busa died of liver failure. He said Busa had been battling liver disease for a long time. He said Busa was the only child of Khulubuse and had been an entrepreneur. He added that Busa is survived by his three sons, father, mother and grandmother. Busa will be laid to rest at the family’s Nkandla homestead on Saturday. Busa’s death comes soon after the former president’s son, Vusi died last month. Vusi was the brother of Duduzane and son of Kate Mantsho-Zuma, who committed suicide in 2001.
