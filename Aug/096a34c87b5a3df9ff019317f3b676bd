A 40-year-old woman has been arrested after killing her own
child, in Vuwani outside Thohoyandou. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said itâ€™s alleged that the mother of
three was sleeping with her children in a separate room, when one of the family
members heard some screams and woke up to investigate. Ngoepe said that is when it was discovered that the little boy's lifeless body was dumped at the entrance of the house and the mother sitting
next to him. The police then arrested the child's mother on the spot, after she was
positively linked to the murder. He said the baby was identified as Maphanga Gundo. "The motive behind this incident is still unknown, but the ongoing police
investigations will tell," Ngoepe said. The suspect will appear before the Vuwani Magistrate's Court soon to face a
charge of murder. Ngoepe urged community members to consult their local relevant professionals
for intervention, in case of any social related condition, instead of resorting
to violence.
