The Modimolle Regional Court sentenced Evy Ezeagbai to five
years in jail, after his conviction on several count of dealing in drugs. The Nigerian drug dealer was spotted driving at high speed
along the N1 North cops, who were on patrol along the N1 near Bela-Bela. NPA spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzanghi said the accused was
then stopped and the police requested to search the vehicle, where Meth
cathinone (commonly known as CAT) was found in the car. The drugs were stashed in a bag behind the driver’s seat. “The estimated street value of the drugs that were
discovered is R887 000,” Malabi-Dzanghi. During trial, when it became clear that the state had a
watertight case, the accused pleaded guilty to the charges. Mashudu said in his plea, he told the court that his
company, Don Don Trading at that time was undergoing financial difficulties and
he was struggling to pay rent and to support his family. He claimed that he received a call from one Paul who invited
him to Johannesburg, who then handed him a bag containing drugs to transport to
Mokopane where a buyer would be waiting. He said he saw this as an opportunity to make quick money. In aggravation of sentence, Advocate Nkhetheni Munyai,
submitted to the court that the guilty plea was not indicative of remorse but
it was tendered in the light of the strength of the state’s case. Munyai argued that
due to the seriousness of the offence, its prevalence and the devastating
effect of drugs in our communities the accused must be removed from society.
