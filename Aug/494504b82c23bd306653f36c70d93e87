IF YOUR paraffin heater is giving you problems, Shampi Finger is the man to approach. Having grown up in a poor family, the 32-year-old man from Batho kasi in Mangaung, Free State didn’t let his upbringing define his life. He used whatever skills he could learn to make ends meet. Shampi claims he is an expert at fixing broken heaters to put food on the table for his family. “I started my business three years ago after realising that people with problems would go to town to get them fixed,” said Shampi. “I believe I was born with the skills to fix things. I used to work for a construction company and carrying cement every day was not the life I wanted.” Shampi said he used all the money he had saved to open his business. “I fix any kind of heater and the price depends on the damage. The money from the business helps me to support my girlfriend and our two kids. I am happy because I am my own boss,” he said. Shampi said his business suffers in summer but he survives by fixing shoes and electronic appliances. “I never went to school or had any training for this, it’s a talent that God gave me. “Jobs are so scarce these days. It’s better to figure out what you can do with your hands, especially if you are not educated. If I could get my own place, I would teach young people these skills so they could open their own businesses and stop depending on the government.”
