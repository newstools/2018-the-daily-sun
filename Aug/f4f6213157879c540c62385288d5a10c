THIS community is always hard at work to make life better for themselves. The people of Lwamondo Hamugomeli, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, settled in the rural, under-developed area years ago. To turn the tables for the better, they embraced former president Thabo Mbeki’s vuk’uzenzele philosophy. And it’s working! Not long ago they managed to construct an access road which reduced the walking distance to the main Thohoyandou road by almost 5km. They were helped by local business Vhavenda Bricks and Munna Ndi Nnyi Men’s Forum. They also reduced the chances of crime by clearing the bush in the area that was a fertile hunting ground for thugs who’d rob people on their way to work. Their efforts haven’t gone unnoticed. The department of public works promised to assist them by supplying concrete pipes. These were to be used to construct a low water bridge allowing vehicles to enter the village. At the weekend, the area was a hive of activity as residents built the bridge. The men’s forum’s chairman, Bardwell Mufunwaini, who initiated the project, was all smiles at the construction site. “We couldn’t sit and wait for government to come and do this for us. “We start our own projects and government joins us along the way.” Councillor Nndwakhulu Mbulaheni said he was waiting for the bridge to be completed to take the report to the municipality. Thulamela municipal spokeman Ndwamato Tshiila said they had to see the bridge first before they could comment.
