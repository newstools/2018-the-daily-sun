POLOKWANE City made history when they defeated Baroka FC for the first time in the Polokwane derby yesterday. Walter Musona and Jabu Maluleke goals in both halfâ€™s of the match ensured that Rise and Shine collect their first three points this season under the guidance of Jozef Vukusic who was appointed in June, replacing Bernard Molekwa. It was also their first time they found the back of the net after losing the opening two matches 1-0 to Black Leopards in the first Limpopo derby and lost 2-0 to the reigning Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns on their second game. Polokwane came to this encounter with an underdog tag as they came sitting at the bottom of the log without a point. But his charges did it in style when they clinched their first three points and kept a clean sheet to move from the bottom of the table. Before this encounter, these two teams met four times, twice in 2016-17 season and twice last season. In all those four matches the two sides drew. They first played a 2-2 draw in their first PSL derby in October 2016, which was followed by a goalless draw in the second round of that season. Last season they played goalless draw yet again in the first round and the second round ended on a 1-1 draw. Experienced Rise and Shine skipper Maluleke scored the final goal and won the man of the match award. Mohammed Anas who made his debut in Rise and Shine colours also had a game to remember as he was involved in both goals that saw his side wining the match.
