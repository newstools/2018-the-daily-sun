MPUMALANGA Premier Refilwe Mtsweni wants women to make the most of their freedom. Mtsweni was speaking at a Women’s Month event at Kwaggafontein Stadium on Saturday. She said: “Our aim as the provincial government is to make a positive impact on the lives of women from all walks of life. “Gone are the days when women were paid less for doing the same job as a man. The women of 1956 fought for the freedom we have today. “We must continue to fight and not waste what they have given us.” She said she owed her appointment as the province’s first woman premier to the women of 1956. “Unfortunately, gender-based violence is still widespread. Women are being raped and killed every day. That must come to an end,” she said. Earlier that day, women’s organisations handed over a memorandum of grievances to Health MEC Sasekani Manzini, who promised to pass it on to the premier. “We’re going to make sure the community’s demands regarding gender-based violence are met,” said the MEC. “We will work with municipalities and top government officials to fight abuse.”
