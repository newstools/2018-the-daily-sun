HE WAS attacked, stabbed and robbed last August but cops have not bust the thugs. Kagiso Monyane (42) from Kroonstad, Free State told Daily Sun he knows the people who robbed him of his iPhone 6s and his groceries on 11 August last year. He said he pointed them out to cops but they refuse to arrest them. Kagiso claimed the investigating officer was in love with his ex-wife. He said he believed he was being punished by the cop and his ex. Kagiso, who is recently divorced, said: “I had just bought groceries when three men attacked me. I was stabbed, robbed and admitted to hospital for few days. “I knew my attackers and I told the cops about them when I opened the case. The case was assigned to the man who is having an affair with my wife. He’s never helpful.” Kagiso said he recently met the couple celebrating in a supermarket and he became suspicious. “I checked on the status of my case at Maokeng cop shop and it was closed. They said the suspects were unknown and could not be found. “The cops are not doing their job and I want my phone,” he said. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sinah Mpakane said a case of robbery was opened. “One of the alleged suspects was interrogated but not linked to the crime. The investigating officer said he’s been waiting for the serial number of the phone from Kagiso so the phone can be traced.” However, Kagiso said the cop has never asked him for the serial number of his stolen phone. Mpakane said: “We advise him to contact the detective commander and station commander if he feels he was not served fairly.”
