The mother of a seven-month-old baby declared dead on 6 August at the Rivas hospital in Villanueva, Honduras, realised her little girl was still alive during the infant’s funeral. Little Keilin Johanna Ortiz Montoya had been admitted to hospital on 3 August with convulsions, diarrhoea, severe hydration and blistered skin caused by a bacterial infection.  Despite intensive treatment at the hospital’s paediatric unit, the baby was pronounced dead three days later and the corresponding death certificate was reportedly issued.    "I had no money to get home,” Ivis said. After a candle-lit vigil during the night the baby was taken to a church in nearby Dos Caminos in northern Honduras for its funeral, but there was found to be breathing. Ivis said they’d put her daughter’s body on a chair in the church and it was then that she noticed baby Keilin was still breathing. Reluctant to return to the hospital that had declared her baby dead, she instead rushed to a local clinic.  The medical staff administered medicine to the baby and a women’s support group persuaded the mom to take the baby back to the hospital’s paediatric unit, local media reported.  The head of the hospital’s paediatric department, Elba Campos, said that the incident was being investigated, but that it was too early to reach any conclusions.
