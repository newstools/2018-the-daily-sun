EDWARD Letsoalo was happily living a peaceful life alone until tragedy struck on Saturday night while he was sleeping. The 66-year-old madala from Ga-Sekgopo Village, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo, said a mystery man tried to kill him in his sleep, allegedly with a petrol bomb. Now he fears for his life. He said he heard a huge blast through his bedroom window and saw a blaze of flames coming in. “I thought my life was coming to an end. I saw a man running away but I did not recognise him. “I don’t have enemies, so I don’t know who would try to kill me,” he said. Madala Edward said all he could save was his ID, Sassa card and his burial scheme book. He sustained minor injuries to his foot and arms. “I had to run for my life. My two-roomed house burned down and I escaped in my underwear. That’s what I was wearing when I went to bed,” he said. He was admitted to Kgapane Hospital and was discharged on Sunday. “I have lost everything and I’m now homeless. I depend on the mercy of my neighbours for food, shelter and clothes. I don’t know how long they can keep helping me,” said the madala. Greater Letaba municipal spokeswoman Lovers Mainetje said she would speak to disaster management about the madala’s situation. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a case of arson was opened but no one had been arrested.
