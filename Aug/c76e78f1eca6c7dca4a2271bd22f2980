WHEN Nomali Mabunda received a threatening message last month she brushed it off. But now the ANC Women’s League branch deputy chairwoman and her family live in fear. What she thought was the clap of an electrical short circuit was actually a gun shot fired straight into her house. The 49-year-old said her house in Tshwane CBD came under attack last Friday as she and her family were watching late night TV. “We saw a spark and my children said it was a bullet that came through the window but I told them it was electric short, so we continued watching TV,” she said. Nomali said the next day her daughter found a bullet. “We called the police and they said they would investigate,” she said. She said she received the threatening message in July. “It said I was a witch, a gossip and a whore and that I needed hard sex.” Nomali said she has no idea who the people behind the threats could be. Nomali said she was a committed member of her organisation and didn’t have a problem with anyone. “I hope the police can find these people and do something about this because we are in danger,” she said. Police spokeswoman Captain Augustine Selepe said a case of malicious damage to property was opened for investigation. “We appeal to anyone who might assist the police to contact Pretoria Central Police Station on 012 353 4233,” said Selepe.
