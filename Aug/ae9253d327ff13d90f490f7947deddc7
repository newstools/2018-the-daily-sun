AS MZANSI celebrated Women’s Day,women offenders gathered at St Albans Prison. Inmates from East London and North End Prison in Port Elizabeth had come to celebrate the day through prayer. Organised by the correctional services department and Umhlobo Wenene FM, the aim of the prayer meting was to revive prisoners’ hope and pray for those affected by rape and abuse. Acting regional commissioner Noziphiwo Dumbela said: “We celebrated Women’s Day with our offenders to give them a sense of belonging. “Being behind bars does not mean the end of their lives. It means they have a chance to become better citizens.” It was important for women offenders to celebrate Women’s Day so they could see people still cared about them. She said community support was important. “These women need our support so when they go back into society, they can use skills learnt while serving time. “Offenders are offered programmes like sport, sewing and hairdressing.” An offender serving 10 years for shoplifting said: “Being locked up is not easy, but the programme helps ease my frustration and recognise my mistakes.”
