HOSTEL dwellers shut down the Pikitup depot in Diepkloof, Soweto yesterday. They closed the gate to prevent workers from entering or leaving the yard. The people demanded to be hired, saying Pikitup had hired people recently but none of them were from the hostel. “Instead, they went as far as the Eastern Cape to find workers,” said Mxolisi Thusini, a representative for the dwellers. Mxolisi claimed people paid a R7 000 bribe for a job. “We couldn’t afford that money and that’s why we didn’t get the jobs,” he said. Pikitup spokesman Muzi Mkhwanazi said: “We have secured a court order to prevent people from disrupting our services.” He said the allegation that people were paying bribes to be employed was an allegation that Pikitup viewed in a serious light. “People who can prove such claims must report them to the police. They must also provide evidence to enable Pikitup to also investigate the claims.”
