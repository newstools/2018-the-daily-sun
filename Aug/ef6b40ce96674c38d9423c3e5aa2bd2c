GCOBANI Ndzongana, the leader of the Zwelihle protests, will go to trial in Stellenbosch, Western Cape. More than five police officers, Ndzongana’s family and community members were in court when he appeared in the Strand Magistrates Court yesterday. Last week, the same court denied Ndzongana bail, saying he had previously received a warning for the same offence. He is accused of public violence for his alleged role in tearing down a fence separating Zwelihle from Hermanus. Ndzongana is due in court again on 20 August, when a trial date will be decided. Residents of Zwelihle protested for 14 days, demanding Ndzongana’s release. Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the area last week and warned the community to stop using violence. The protest left people disabled and a baby was killed by teargas. A police officer was also attacked and his firearms were stolen. Two of the three guns were later recovered. During a municipal address, Overstrand mayor Dudley Coetzee said the damage to public property added up to more than R39 million. This included damage done to the kasi’s transfer station, recycling plant, library, taxi ranks, trading stalls and housing offices. “Overstrand was one of the leading municipalities in the country as far as refuse recycling is concerned. Because of this, we had to cease our recycling programme,” he said. “No recycling can take place, resulting in job losses. The recycle swop shops, which benefited our children, are now useless.” He thanked councillors and residents of Zwelihle for working towards finding a lasting solution to the crisis.
