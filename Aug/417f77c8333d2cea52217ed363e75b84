RESIDENTS have been complaining about a dirty yard for over a year. Their prayers have finally been answered.Daily Sun published an article about Neo Rakale’s yard in zone 4 of Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane last month. Residents said the 35-year-old collected rubbish and claimed he was recycling it. They said they pleaded with him several times to remove the rubbish but he didn’t listen to them. Councillor Jabu Rammushi said they had tried to clean the yard before, but Neo continued to collect rubbish. After the article was published, Rammushi and residents took a stand. “I’ve now supplied him with containers where he can put his recycling material without making this place a dump,” said Rammushi. He said he also found Neo’s family and asked them to intervene. “They said Neo doesn’t want to live with them,” he said. Resident Gloria Mokhoko (34) said she was happy. “We’ve been living in filth. This place was a pigsty but now we can open our windows without fear of the bad smell and flies.” She said their children were also safe. “Our kids were held captive because we were scared they would play in the dirty yard. Now they are free to go outside and play.” Another resident, Marang Kenoshi (59), said they would continue to monitor the situation. “We’ll make sure we clean it up because he might continue to make a mess,” she said.
