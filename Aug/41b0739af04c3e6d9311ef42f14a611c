DJ Chynaman believes his latest single will be a top 10 hit during the festive season. Chynaman released an Afro-house single titled Yini. The talented DJ teamed up with singer and songwriter Mpumi for the song. The single can be bought on digital music stores. Chynaman, whose real name is Siyabonga Gumede, told SunBuzz the amount of work he put into producing the single made him believe it would be on high rotation towards the end of the year. He said Mpumi’s lyrics were just what the song needed. “Featuring Mpumi was a strategic move. “She is a well-known artist who will make my work more popular,” said Chynaman. He said he would stick to making house music instead of producing gqom, a genre of music that is dominating the airwaves at the moment. He said he was not a seasonal musician who followed trends. The DJ who is originally from Mandeni, northern KZN is no newcomer to the music scene. He started playing the saxophone, flute and drums for other musicians in 1996. His big break came in 2006 when his single Xavatha became a hit. The song’s popularity turned Chynaman into a household name. Since then, he has worked with chart-topping DJs like Tira, Sox and Bongz. He said he has toured in the United States and Spain. Chynaman said he was planning to go to Dubai at the end of the year.
