MOST jailbirds find it hard to get a job and settle down. Bosses, more often than not, don’t give them the time of day. They simply don’t trust them. That’s why the KwaDukuza Municipality recently set up talks with a group of them to understand the issues they face. The initiative was started by mayor Ricardo Mthembu. Parolee Thami Mbonambi said: “Some of us are forced to lie on our CVs and company profiles. “When we tell the truth we’re discriminated against.” He said they were also not safe in communities. According to Thami, when something wrongs happened – such as a crime, for instance – they became the prime suspects. He said they appreciated that the municipality was coming up with ways to assist them. Deputy mayor Dolly Govender asked that parolees play an active role in stopping youths from joining a life of crime. He said councillors, too, had a duty to ensure that communities don’t shun offenders. “Society and business should forgive parolees and rehabilitated inmates and not constantly rsemind them that they had previous offences,” Govender told Daily Sun.
