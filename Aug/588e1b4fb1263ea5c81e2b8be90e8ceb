A MANHUNT is underway in Addo, Eastern Cape after four armed men robbed an elderly couple in a guest house on Monday. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said the elderly couple were on holiday from Cape Town. “The four armed men entered the cottage through an unlocked door. They threatened the couple, who are in their 80s. They demanded money and cellphones,” said Swart. The suspects then locked them in the cottage and removed items from their vehicle before fleeing on foot with the car keys. “An undisclosed amount of cash, a camera and cellphones were stolen. “The two sustained injuries and were taken to hospital. They were found by security guards who responded to the alarm. Uitenhage detectives are investigating a case of house robbery and have launched a manhunt for the four suspects. “Detectives are following up on all possible leads,” Swart said. Cops are appealing to business owners to look out for any suspicious behaviour and ensure they use the security measures in place.
