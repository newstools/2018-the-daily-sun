Emmerson Mnangagwa has been officially sworn in as Zimbabwe’s president! Mnangagwa is the second president of Zimbzbwe since the country gained independence in the 80s. Mnangagwa’s swearing in took place at the Zimbabwe National Sports Stadium in Harare on Sunday (26 August). The swearing in of Mnangagwa comes after an intense and bitter election campaign which was marred by violence and civil unrest. After Mnangagwa was announced the winner of the election campaign, Zimbabwe broke into chaos. Proests were held in different parts of the country, to which Mnangagwa responded with a military crackdown. The inauguration was attended by Minister of International Relations Lindiwe Sisulu, President Cyril Ramaphosa and former Tanzania president Jakaya Kikwete, representing current president John Magafuli. The stadium was packed to capacity as thousands of Zimbabweans flocked to witness the inauguration of their new head of state. Movement for Democratic Change’s Nelson Chamisa, however, did not attend the inauguration. This after the Zimbabwean Constitutional Court on Friday rejected opposition claims of vote-rigging and upheld the president's narrow July 30 victory. His spokesperson Nkululeko Sibanda was quoted by News24 as saying that Chamisa did not receive an invitation. “They know they can't invite me to a wedding where I was the one supposed to be receiving the gifts," he was quoted as saying.”
