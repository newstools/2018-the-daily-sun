ZONDENI SOBUKWE, the widow of the Pan African Congress founder Robert Sobukwe, will be honoured at a special state funeral at the Graaff-Reinet Botanical Gardens in the Eastern Cape today. She died at her home after a long illness at the age of 91. She will be laid to rest at Asheville, near the Kroonvale Cemetery where her husband is also buried. Deputy president David Mabuza will deliver the eulogy. Mama Sobukwe was separated from her husband in 1963 when he was jailed on Robben Island. At the Truth and Reconciliation Commission she said about her husband: “Nothing came to me as a surprise or shock. From the day I met him he was in the struggle and died in the struggle.” Acting director-general of the Government Communication Information System, Phumla Williams, said the funeral is open to the public. Condolence books are available at the Graaff-Reinet Methodist Church and Dr Beyers Naude Municipality for those wishing to send messages of condolences. “Gogo Zondeni, a struggle stalwart in her own right, will be remembered for her dedication to the freedom struggle. She received the Order of Luthuli in Silver for her call for freedom of the people and support of jailed freedom fighters,” said Williams. “Mama Sobukwe illustrates the collective experience of many black women throughout the continent who contributed to the liberation struggle.”
