THE family of a gogo who died last Friday at King Edward VIII Hospital in Durban want answers. Gogo Qalazile Phungula (68) from A section in Umlazi, south of Durban, died after spending close to a month in hospital. Jane Phungula (63) said her sister’s pyjamas and linen were covered in blood the day before she died. “I asked Qalazile why she was sleeping in a pool of blood, and she said the nurses told her to change as soon as she felt better,” she said. Jane said she did not report the matter because she feared her sister would be victimised. She said she was also concerned when she found that a drip had been removed from Qalazile’s arm. Jane said Qalazile told her the nurses said the doctors were the only ones who could insert a drip The following day, the hospital called to inform her Qalazile was dead. “When we got there we overheard nurses saying my sister died because she had lost a lot of blood. “We asked them about the death, but they brushed us off with hurtful words,” said Jane. She claimed the nurses said they were not the only family that had lost a relative, so there was no need to make a big fuss about it. “We believe their negligence was the reason my sister died.” KZN Health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said: “The death of any individual is a painful experience. “Without prejudice, the department would like to pass its condolences to the affected family. “Unfortunately, the family did not lodge a formal complaint with hospital management. “Following the serious allegations revealed in the inquiry by the newspaper, the department has contacted the hospital. “Management is currently gathering the facts, which will determine the way forward.”
