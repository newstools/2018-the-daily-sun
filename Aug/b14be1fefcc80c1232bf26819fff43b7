VERONICA Sobukwe, widow of struggle icon Robert Sobukwe, was supposed to be buried peacefully at Kroonvale Cemetery in Graaff-Reinet, Eastern Cape. But chaos erupted on Saturday when PAC members objected to some aspects of the funeral. They prevented a faction led by party president Narius Moloto from attending the funeral. Some also suggested the party flag cover Sobukwe’s coffin, instead of the South African flag. Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula was taunted by members of the party. Regional commissar Manqindi Kwaza was escorted off stage by police when he tried to take over the proceedings. Kwaza told Daily Sun: “Our programme was hijacked by the ANC. “I took the microphone to make the event a PAC funeral.” Simphiwe Tshabalala, who travelled from Joburg for the funeral, said: “The reason people are still poor is because the ANC is a party of criminals. “Why do they love Mama Sobukwe now when they rejected her and Tata Sobukwe while they were alive?” Speakers at the funeral took turns attacking the ruling party. Political analyst Lebohang Pheko said: “When there is a commemoration, the Sobukwe name isn’t mentioned. “When roads, bridges and airports are being renamed, the Sobukwes are ignored.” Former PAC leader Bishop Stanley Mogoba said: “The party should work harder to honour the Sobukwes.” Ntsiki Biko, widow of late activist Steve Biko, said: “Please keep the Sobukwe legacy alive.” Phumla Williams, the acting director-general of the government communication and information system, told the People’s Paper: “We are saddened by the behaviour of certain people.” She said they had disrespected the funeral.
