Madala Sprinkaan Seerane from Timbavati Village, outside Acornhoek in Mpumalanga, visited the local clinic on Saturday. The 70-year-old was ambushed by three men while driving back home. He was gunned down by hijackers just metres away from his house. A witness told Daily Sun a speeding bakkie with three occupants overtook the madala’s bakkie. “The speeding bakkie apparently ran out of petrol and stopped a few metres away,” said the witness. “The three men spontaneously jumped out of their car and started shooting at the madala’s bakkie in an attempt to hijack him. “The madala tried to drive away, but his bakkie came to a halt further down the road. “He died in a pool of blood behind the steering wheel. The killers fled the scene on foot.” The victim’s son Wikios (50) said they received a call that their dad had been gunned down. “We found our dad lying there, dead,” said Wikios. Spokeswoman Captain Mpho Nonyane said cops were investigating cases of hijacking, armed robbery and murder. “One of the suspects was wounded in the shoot-out. He is under police guard in hospital,” said Nonyane. Anyone with information is urged to contact Colonel Albert Manzini on 082 469 1031 or Mhala police on 013 7730 331.
