COULD this be the end of the road for Edward Manqele? The former Kaizer Chiefs seems to be following the same path taken by another former Amakhosi man, David Mathebula, who joined Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila at the beginning of last season, only to retire after a short stint with the club. Manqele rose to stardom in the 2013-14 season when he finished among the top goal-scorers. But his promising career took a nose­dive when he joined Chiefs from Chippa United in 2015. Manqele was released by Chiefs in April last year and his career has been on a downward spiral since then as he kept changing clubs. The 31-year-old striker has resurfaced at Tshakhuma, where he is hoping to resurrect his career. But this could be the beginning of the end, as many veterans struggle to regain their form once they go down to the National First Division. And he has not played regularly in almost three seasons. Manqele, who left Free State Stars in January, signed with Tshakhuma last Friday. The well-travelled striker says he wants to revive his career and get his scoring mojo back. “I don’t have anything to prove to anyone, for me it’s about playing football, doing what I do best,” Manqele said. “For me it is a good start here (Tshakhuma). I want to gain confidence, momentum and start banging in the goals. I want to get my groove back and help the team move forward, but I’m not putting myself under unnecessary pressure.” The former Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns man was part of the Tshakhuma squad that played to a goalless draw with Uthongathi FC in the league’s opening fixtures last Saturday. He said: “From what I have seen we can compete. Obviously it’s not easy but we have to take each game as it comes. We have a good squad.” Venda-based Tshakhuma host Real Kings at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Sunday (3pm).
