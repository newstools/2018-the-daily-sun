WHEN traffic cops spotted the Toyota Quantum blocking the road on Friday, they approached the driver. They told him he was not allowed to offload passengers in a bus zone and impounded the taxi. But chaos ensued at the impound yard when the owner – a member of the police’s K9 unit – took back the taxi by force. The stunned officers at Lengau Traffic Department in Bloemfontein, Mangaung immediately went to Parkweg Police Station and opened a case against the cop. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane confirmed the incident. He said: “The 39-year-old sergeant from the K9 unit was arrested on Friday. “The incident started at St Andrew Street, where the driver of the minibus allegedly broke the  Road Traffic Act at about 5pm. “A case of obstructing and defeating the ends of justice was opened against the sergeant. “He will appear in court soon.” Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Moeketsi Sempe condemned the incident. He said: “Let’s allow the law to take its course. “No one is above the law, even police officers. “Departmental processes are already underway and no stone will be left unturned.”
