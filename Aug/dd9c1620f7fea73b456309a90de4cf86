Afro soul and jazz musician Dumza Maswana is headed to the UK. He will perform at the Edinburgh International Festival as part of Mzansi Music Ensemble. He met the group two years ago when they performed a tribute to late jazz artist Victor Ntoni. This year’s theme is “A tribute to Nelson Mandela”. The three-week festival will feature music, theatre, dance and opera performances. Dumza said he was excited when the group asked him to perform with them at the festival. He told SunBuzz he was honoured to be one of the musicians who will pay tribute to South Africa’s first democratically elected president. The musician said he intended to return to the UK for a solo tour. “This will be my first trip outside South Africa, and I don’t know what to expect,” he said. “The ensemble and I have worked on giving the audience a great performance. “This is a popular festival that promotes talented artists from all over the world. “We’ve prepared a good set that’s aligned with the theme, and we’ll perform covers of songs by Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela and Victor Ntoni.” He said he and the ensemble wanted to give the audience an idea of what it meant to be South African. “Like any artist who’s performing outside their country, the primary focus is to tell our story and share our sound with the rest of the world.” Dumza said the performance will have a different flavour. “It will cater for a diverse audience,” he said. They will feature renowned musicians such as jazz singer Nosisi Mavela and praise poet Jessica Mbangeni. Dumza said he hoped to receive a good response when he performs songs from his second album Molo. He has just finished recording his live DVD and hopes to release it when he returns from the UK. “I’m also working on my third studio album with pianist Nduduzo Makhathini,” he said. “I’m excited about the upcoming project because it will have more elements of jazz.” He said they will also pay tribute to legendary local jazz artists.
