Former US Senator John McCain has passed away after a battle with cancer. The 81 year-old, who served as a Senator from Arizona, died over the weekend (25 August). McCain was battling brain cancer after being diagnosed in 2017. He died a few days before his 82nd birthday. McCain was a decorated war veteran that fought in the Vietnam War, and was captured during a bombing mission. McCain also ran alongside former US president Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential elections. He served as the Arizona Senator, and had a political career spanning three decades. He first ran as a presidential candidate in 2000 when he went up against former president George W. Bush Jr. who eventually became president. He ran again in 2008 against Obama. McCain served as the Arizona Senate for six terms from 1987. “Some lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended. Some voices are so vibrant, it is hard to think of them stilled. John McCain was a man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order. He was a public servant in the finest traditions of our country. And to me, he was a friend whom I’ll deeply miss,” former president Bush said of the passing of McCain. “John McCain was a man of honour, a true patriot in the best sense of the word. Americans will be forever grateful for his heroic military service and for his steadfast integrity as a member of the United States Senate,” said former president Jimmy Carter.
