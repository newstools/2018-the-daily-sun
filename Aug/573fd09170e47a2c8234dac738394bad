THE reputation of a respected Japanese medical varsity is in flames following the uncovering of evidence that for years it lied about test results of women in order to keep them out. According to Japan Times, since about 2010 Tokyo Medical University has routinely cut up to 20% off entrance exam scores to limit the number of women who get accepted to about 30% of the intake. This was only discovered this week following investigations into a separate bribery scandal involving the varsity’s top executives and a senior education ministry official. The varsity executives are accused of promising the ministry official that his son will be enrolled in exchange for a government subsidy. The probe into the bribery scandal is how light was shed on the practice of deliberately lowering the exam results of female candidates. Varsity officials apparently secretly justified it to each other by claiming that female doctors often resign or take leave after getting married or giving birth. None of the candidates sitting for the entrance exam were made aware of the practice. Ruriko Tsushima, an executive board member at the Japan Joint Association of Medical Professional Women, told Japan Times: “I can’t forgive what the institution is said to have done to people who studied hard to get into the university, hoping to become doctors. “It shouldn’t happen in a democratic country that is supposed to provide equal educational opportunities.” The education ministry has asked the varsity to explain its treatment of female applicants, said the report.
