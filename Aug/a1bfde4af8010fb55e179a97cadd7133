TWO-YEAR-OLD Sibusiso Ncokwana was playing in a neighbour’s yard with his young sister on Saturday when a car crashed into a wall and buried the little boy alive. And as if that was not enough, his mourning family was left enraged when cops failed to arrest his alleged drunk killer. His sobbing mum told Daily Sun that the cops’ do-not-care attitude meant her son was killed twice! Daily Sun visited the Ncokwana family in Bonane, just outside Vanderbijlpark in the Vaal, south of Joburg. The mother, Zandile Ncokwana, spoke to the SunTeam as her tears flowed. “I received a call from my sister telling me to rush home because something tragic had befallen my son. “When I got home, I was told Sibusiso had been in an accident. “When I arrived at the scene I found my son set aside by a neighbour in the hope he would get medical assistance,” she said. The mother of three said she was very distraught. “He was so young. We thought he would grow up and become a great man. “Little did we know that we would fetch his lifeless little body from the street,” she said. The sad mum was too overcome to continue speaking and Sibusiso’s father Elliot Chauke (44) told the People’s Paper that police had failed the family. “Following the tragic incident, the driver of the car drove back home, but neighbours stopped him and apprehended him at his home, fearing he would run away again. After five hours of keeping him, cops left the scene and never went back to his home to run tests after residents alleged he was drunk,” Elliot said. Vanderbijlpark cops are investigating a case of culpable homicide. Spokeswoman Sergeant Gertrude Makhale said the suspect was at large.
