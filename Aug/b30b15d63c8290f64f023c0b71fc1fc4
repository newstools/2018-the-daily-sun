COMPUTER students at Tosa College in Thabong won’t be attending lectures for a while. At about 1am on Tuesday, their college was attacked and security guards handcuffed before a gang of thugs made off with 54 computers valued at R400 000. Thabong cops said they were hunting for over 10 suspects involved in the armed robbery. Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane told Daily Sun four security guards at the college, three men and a woman, were patrolling the premises when they were attacked by heavily armed men. The thugs overpowered the guards. “The suspects allegedly tied up the guards with handcuffs and cable ties and held them at gunpoint in one of the guardrooms. “Allegedly, during the fight, one of the guards was hit on the head with a firearm. “The suspects allegedly stole 54 computer towers, as well as two security two-way radios before fleeing the scene. “The four security guards managed to untie themselves and called Thabong cops and emergency services. “A case of business robbery was registered. “The guard who sustained injuries was taken to hospital,” Mokhuoane said. A student said he was worried the thugs would soon target them in the classroom. “I hope I finish with my studies before something bad happens to any of us,” he said. Mokhuoane said: “Anyone with information should contact Detective-Colonel Mzamo Nyamane of Thabong detective unit at 082 453 0759, their nearest cop shop or 08600 10111.”
