KwaZulu-Natal police are investigating after four men were shot dead in Nquthu. This is after unknown suspects allegedly approached the men, who are believed to have been travelling in their vehicle to fetch goods in the town. According to police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, the suspects dumped the bodies of Nhlakanipho Mabaso, 23, Nkomo Zulu, 29, and Simphiwe Dlamini, 30, near the road at Ntabezibomvu, before making off with their vehicle. Zwane said the suspects then proceeded to the home of one of the men they had just killed, where they shot another man, 21-year-old Philani Mabaso and an elderly woman. Philani died at the hospital, while the 69-year-old is still receiving treatment for her injuries. “A task team are still on the hunt for those responsible for the callous murders. We are also appealing to anyone who may have information with regards to their identities or whereabouts,” Zwane said. SOURCE: NEWS24
