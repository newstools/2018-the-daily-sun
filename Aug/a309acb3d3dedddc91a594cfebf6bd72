KASI people were shocked and angry after an infant’s body was found in a sewerage drain in Kagiso, Mogale City, on Sunday morning. Resident Peter Nhantumbo (28) said: “I’m so hurt and I can’t stop thinking about the incident. “There are better ways to solve problems than to resort to evil ways.” Another resident, Elizabeth Moagi (45), told Daily Sun: “The incident was traumatising. We’re angry because the municipality doesn’t care. “We report blocked drains all the time and municipal workers take time to come to the area. “It’s sad that it had to take such a grim discovery to get the municipality to provide services to the people.” Elizabeth said at first she couldn’t believe it when she heard about the body, until she saw cops and paramedics. “I’m saddened by the incident,” she said. Kagiso police spokesman Solomon Sibiya confirmed the incident. He said a case of concealment of birth was opened.
