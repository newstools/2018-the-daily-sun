NEW Chippa United head coach Eric Tinkler says there’s nothing extraordinary or special about tonight’s (7.30pm) encounter with SuperSport United, despite it being the first time he will come up against his former employers. Tinkler recently joined the Chilli Boys, replacing Dan Malesela who was fired three matches into the season. His takes his place in the hot seat against Kaitano Tembo in tonight’s Absa Premiership encounter at Lucas Moripe Stadium. The former Bafana Bafana player resigned at SuperSport in March after battling to maintain consistency, leaving Tembo to carry on and finish a poor 2017-18 term. Speaking to SunSport yesterday, the 48-year-old mentor said it would take time for players to adjust to his training methodology but they have been tasked to win the match against SuperSport. “They are one of the big teams in the PSL, plus they are title contenders, come to think of it, this season. We need points to move away from the foot of the table going into the Fifa break,” said Tinkler. “It is a matter of taking what we have been doing at training into the match.” Chippa are languishing in 15th place in the table with a point from their draw with Black Leopards and two defeats to Bloemfontein Celtic and Orlando Pirates respectively. Tinkler said his biggest worry ahead of the match was their leaky defence. In just three games, Chippa have conceded five goals. “There are quality players in this team but we all know individual brilliance is not enough. I told the boys when I came here that we need to work as a collective, team effort is key. We will work on that in the two weeks of the Fifa break.” SuperSport go into this encounter with six points from three games.
