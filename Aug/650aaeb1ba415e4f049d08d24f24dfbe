  North West Premier Job Mokgoro has been appointed as the interim convener of the province. Mokgoro replaced Mahumapelo as the province's premier earlier this year. The partyâ€™s highest decision-making body held a special NEC in Cape Town on Thursday, meeting amidst divisions in that province. News24 reports that Mahumapelo put up a fight to keep his position. He is said to have accused some members of plotting to oust him. The meeting is understood to have gone until the early hours and was undecided about the decision, with some members arguing that there was a lack of consistency in applying the rules.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-north-west-pec-disbanded-supra-mahumapelo-removed-as-provincial-chair-20180831
