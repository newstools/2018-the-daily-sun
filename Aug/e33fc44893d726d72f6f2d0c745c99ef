BY midday last Tuesday, primary and secondary schools were empty. That’s because a group of pupils from schools in Refilwe near Cullinan, Tshwane, went from school to school, calling on pupils to join their protest. The caretaker at Sedibeng Primary locked the gates, but pupils threatened to break it down. The caretaker opened it and Sedibeng pupils came running outside. The protesters were demanding that the scholar transport they had been promised was delivered. Mavis Masondo (15) said they walked long distances to get to school every day. “We get to school sweaty and with dust on our feet,” she said. “This place is dangerous and some of our friends get mugged.” Mavis said they often fell asleep in class. “Some girls end up dating taxi drivers just to get free transport.” She said they had been waiting since January for scholar transport to start operating and that it had disrupted schooling. Parent Patience Sepalo (39) said they had no choice but to join their children. “Most of us depend on child support grants. We can’t afford to pay for transport. We’re forced to walk our children to school because thugs and sugar daddies are always waiting for them. “If the children use transport, where will the blessers with big cars and drug dealers get to them?” Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “It must be noted that a 5km distance is required for scholar transport and these pupils don’t qualify.”
