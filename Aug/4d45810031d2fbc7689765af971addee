TO LOSE a child is any mother’s worst fear. But for Pinky Mashatule (54) from Freedom Park in the south of Joburg, the pain is double. That’s because she blames herself for calling security when her son attacked her . . . and he was shot dead! She said her dead son now haunts her. “He was killed in the kitchen. Now whenever I enter the kitchen I hear his voice.” She said the voice says, “I’m sorry, Mum.” Pinky told the People’s Paper that she owned a tavern at her home. She said her fight with her son, Tsieni Masuku, started in the tavern. “I went into the house and he followed me. He closed the door and refused to let me out. He took out a knife and threatened to stab me,” she said. Pinky said she warned him she would press the panic button to call the security guards. “I pressed it and they came quickly.” Pinky said Tsieni opened the door but quarrelled with the guards. A security guard threatened to shoot him but Tsieni wouldn’t back off. “The security guard shot him and he died.” Pinky said even though months had passed, she still blames herself for the death of her son. “I shouldn’t have called the guards.”
