LEARNING was disrupted at Gwili-Gwili Primary School in Keiskammahoek, Eastern Cape. This after pupils and parents staged a protest outside the school on Tuesday. They were demanding that the decision to combine two local schools be reversed. They claim they were informed in a meeting that their school was officially closed by the education department because it did not have enough pupils. The school reportedly has 89 pupils. All pupils would have to go to the nearby Mnandi Primary School. One of the parents said they were not happy with the decision. “Our concern is security. How can a grade R pupil be expected to travel to the other school? This will put our kids’ lives in danger,” she said. Another parent, whose daughter is in grade 1, said: “We submitted a proposal to the department in November requesting that some grades, including grade R, be left here. “In June, we were told that the decision was final.” SGB deputy chairman Avuyile Ulana refused to comment. Eastern Cape Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima confirmed that the school was officially closed.
