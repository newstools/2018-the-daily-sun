AS THE man who allegedly hacked his mother to death is set to appear in court today, a little more detail of the horror has come to light. Butterworth police spokesman Captain Jackson Manatha said the gruesome crime happened in Ngqamakhwe after 9pm on Friday when the son and his 88-year-old mum “had a misunderstanding”. As gogo Nogem Mahamba’s scared grandkids hid in a room, their 55-year-old dad reportedly hacked his mum to death with an axe. Manatha told Daily Sun: “The suspect is alleged to have used an axe to fatally wound his mother on the night in question. Gogo’s grandkids were in a separate room and were scared to stop their father as he was armed with an axe.” Manatha said the grandkids only noticed in the early hours of Saturday that gogo Nogem had died. “It is not clear what the misunderstanding was about,” said Manatha. The man will appear in the Ngqamakhwe Magistrates Court today on a murder charge. Butterworth commander Brigadier Ngangema Xakavu said: “I am shocked by the murder of an old defenceless woman, especially by a person who was supposed to protect her.” The matter was postponed to Thursday. It is alleged that he teen was not happy that his dad put a saddle in his room and attacked him.
