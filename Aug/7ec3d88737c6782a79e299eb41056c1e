LIFE is hard for Killer Mokoena. The 53-year-old from Goromane in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga has been living in a crumbling shack for more than five years. He told Daily Sun he hoped a Good Samaritan would help him build a house because he is unemployed. “I’ve tried to apply for an RDP house but had no luck. “I am appealing to a Good Samaritan to help me build a house because I can’t live in this shack any more.” Killer is suffering from TB and said he desperately needed a proper house so he could get better. “This shack is not fit for a human. I can’t even find a job because of my illness. “I have lost hope in life. I just wish someone will help me live a better life.” Freddy Ngobe, a spokesman for the human settlements department, said: “We tried to intervene in the situation and checked on the housing subsidy system, but we discovered that Killer’s application was declined.” He said officials from the department would help Killer with the housing application process so he cand benefit from existing projects in the municipality.
