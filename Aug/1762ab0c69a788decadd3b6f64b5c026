RETIRED former International Boxing Organisation international featherweight champion Macbute “Macman” Sinyabi is set to throw his first big punch as boxing promoter when he stages a seven-bout event at Mdantsane Indoor Sports Centre on Sunday. The former boxing star, who had a love-hate relationship with fans due to his flamboyant character, has vowed to change the face of local boxing. Talking about his maiden boxing extravaganza, Sinyabi said he is expecting the mother of all battles. The event will be headlined by a grudge rematch between Eastern Cape junior bantamweight arch-rivals Athenkosi “Imoto Entsonts’imali” Dumezweni and Lindile “Slyza Tsotsi” Tshemese. The two adversaries will battle out for the vacant South African junior bantamweight title. “I know for a fact that grudge rematches always sell, both camps have something to prove and that translates to electrifying performances. People from Mthatha are expected to come in huge numbers to support their fighter. The bout promises to be a cracker,” he said. Sinyabi hung up his gloves two years ago after surrendering his national featherweight belt to four-fight novice Azinga “Golden Boy” Fuzile. As a businessman, the MMT Boxing Promotions and Events boss said he would produce business-minded fighters. “I will change the South African boxing landscape. I want to produce athletes who are not only fighters but business-minded. I want to produce boxers who think and behave like millionaires. I have never achieved world champion status and I aim to help local fighters live the dream of becoming a world champion,” said Sinyabi. He gave credit to the late boxing trainer, Nick Durandt, for his success. “He must be smiling wherever he is, seeing the people he shaped doing well. It is one of the reasons I have featured fighters from the stable of his son, Damian Durandt.”
