THE father of a girl who was allegedly klapped by a teacher has laid an assault charge. The incident apparently took place at Nongweleza High School in Nqutshini Village in Empangeni, northern KZN, on Thursday. The angry dad (68) told Daily Sun he was waiting for police to finalise their investigations. He said it angered him that the teacher beat his daughter, almost as if he was beating a man. “There was no need for him to beat her in that manner,” said the dad. He said his daughter had told him the teacher beat her for asking a villager to buy her sweets at a tuck shop. “It was during school hours, so she didn’t go outside the school gate but asked someone to buy sweets for her,” he said. “When the teacher saw the villager handing her the sweets, he became angry and called her to the staff room and started beating her.” Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said: “Corporal punishment was outlawed at our schools. “We’ll come down hard on teachers who’re still practising it.”
