YESTERDAY, the Port Elizabeth High Court heard Andy Kawa was suffering from a psychological condition after she was raped. Advocate Timothy Bruinders was presenting his closing argument in Kawa’s case. The 55-year-old is suing Police Minister Bheki Cele, former Humewood Police Station commander Brigadier Ronald Koll, and two investigating officers for R6 million. The businesswoman from Gauteng was kidnapped in 2010 during an evening walk along Kings Beach. After she was gang-raped and held hostage by a group of men, she managed to free herself the next morning. Bruinders said the attack had affected his client psychologically. “Police failed to search the area where her car was left and it was broken into. “They never provided us with proper reasons why they didn’t search the car after they were informed she was missing. “Police also failed to search the area where she was raped. No one from the police told this court why but just neglected her case.” Bruinders said after Kawa wrote letters to the station commander requesting an update on her case, he and the investigating officers failed to keep her updated. “She resorted to conducting the investigation on her own. CCTV footage was obtained when she was investigating the case on her own,” he said. The case continues.
