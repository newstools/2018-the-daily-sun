YESTERDAY, 44 candles were lit to remember the 44 miners killed in the Marikana massacre in 2012. Each candle laid out in Mooinooi, outside Rustenburg in North West, had the name of a miner who died fighting for a living wage of R12 500 engraved on it. Speaking at the event, Lonmin Mine’s Khaya Ngcwembe said the week remained a painful one for the company. He said Lonmin acknowledged the miners were fathers, brothers, uncles and sons. “This is a week that changed our lives. It’s a time that’s sacred. It’s a time to honour the huge sacrifices of these men and a time to learn from these circumstances and ensure it never happens again,” he said. Ngcwembe said by the end of the year, the company expected 1 240 apartments to be finished, to be occupied by miners and their families. “We have dedicated energy, time and money to providing modern housing. Since 2012, a total of R500 million has been set aside for the project,” said Ngcwembe. A Marikana memorial park is being planned and will have a museum bearing the names of the late miners.
