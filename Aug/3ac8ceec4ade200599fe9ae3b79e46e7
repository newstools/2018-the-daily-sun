SOLOMON Malema is worried that someone is out to get him. The 58-year-old from Shayandima outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo told Daily Sun strange things keep happening at his house but he couldn’t think of anyone who would want to harm him. In 2016 he arrived at home to find a naked woman in his yard in broad daylight. Solomon was shocked and so were his neighbours. He called the police but by the time they arrived, the woman had been taken away by a gogo. “I didn’t open a case but the woman’s presence in my yard is still a mystery,” Solomon told the People’s Paper. On Sunday night he said he heard a noise on the roof of his house but he ignored it. But on Monday, while relaxing with his friend Khodani Nelufule, he noticed a red string that stretched from the fence to the roof of his house. “When I heard a noise I thought I was dreaming but now I believe there are people who are after me. “I don’t have an idea what they want from me,” he said He said he couldn’t understand how the string stretched over the his roof. “Something is wrong here but I don’t have any answers. I believe there’s a link between the 2016 incident and the latest one. “Strange things haunt me and I’m tired of living like this.” Solomon said as a Christian he was confident God would protect him. Matamba Mamuremi of the Vhangona Indigenous Health Practitioners said Solomon should seek strong traditional healing advice from two traditional healers.
