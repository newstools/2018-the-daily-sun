PEOPLE from Baalkop in Ladysmith, KZN have brought their village to a standstill. The protesters apparently dug up the Helpmekaar Road, preventing people moving in and out of the village, while pupils couldn’t get to school yesterday. The protest began on Tuesday as angry residents demanded that officials come to listen to their grievances. They said their village has been without water for months and their cry was falling on deaf ears. They said their taps ran dry at the beginning of last year, when trucks delivered water, but then deliveries stopped. Then they had to get water from a dam but now it too has run dry. Induna Siyabonga Sibisi said: “We have been ignored for too long and our only source of water has dried up. We have to travel to get water from villages.” Nonjabulo Sokhulu (34) said they would block the road until their problems were solved. “Kids couldn’t go to school but this is the only language officials understand.” Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed residents had blocked the road, complaining about service delivery. “Police are at the scene,” Gwala said. Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said they condemn the disturbance of learning in any form.
