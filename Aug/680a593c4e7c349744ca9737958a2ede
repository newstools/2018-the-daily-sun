SHE got shocking news from her sangoma husband when she got back home. He told her that she was in car accident earlier, but kept the news from him. But Siziwe Mangena (36) from Montana in Tshwane said she was never in an accident. Her response got her the beating of her life on Monday when her husband said his ancestors told him about the accident and they would never lie. “We went to my car and he showed me dents, which made what he was saying sound more ridiculous,” she told Daily Sun. She said her husband told her he believed his ancestors more than her. She said he went crazy when she told him that she had no reason to lie. “He kicked, punched and threw bricks at me and as he was just about to stab me with a lawn sprinkler, our neighbours came to my rescue,” she said. She said the neighbours called the police. Siziwe later opened a case and got a protection order. “I want him to rot in jail and I am also filing for divorce.” Sinoville police spokesman Warrant Officer Johanna van Dyk said the man was arrested and a case of assault was opened. He is expected to appear in court today.
