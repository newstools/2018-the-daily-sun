THERE were rhymes, rap battles and hip hop beats as family, friends and colleagues gathered to say goodbye to Pro yesterday. In attendance at the memorial service held at Bassline, Joburg for the rapper whose real name was Linda Mkhize, were EFF leader Julius Malema and Gauteng Arts MEC Faith Mazibuko. Phumlani Sandiwa, a close friend of ProKid, said: “Linda had a magnetic pull and we always went with him but we wanted him to come to us. “We pulled him to church and that’s how our bond grew, through praying together. I’m now a pastor but he was called to be Soweto’s finest. Being chosen to do different things never came between us. Rapper Kwesta, who attended with his wife, said he wasn’t okay and didn’t want to pretend to be. “I am who I am because of Pro. Death better be proud because you got the best. I have lost a brother who always encouraged me to be the best I could be. My career and inspiration comes from him. He always wanted to see others do better,” said Kwesta. Music executive Thabiso Khathi, who worked with Pro on his first album, said the late rapper was truly great. “He ticked all the boxes for relevance in our field. His first album was launched here at Bassline and it was as packed as it is today,” he said. Producer Mojalefa Tsotetsi, better known as Dome, said he had lost a brother. Famous faces at the service included Cassper Nyovest, Major League DJz, AKA, Mr Selwyn, Sjava, Zulu Mob, Red Button and Teargas. Pro died last Wednesday. His funeral will be held at the University of Joburg’s Soweto campus on Sunday.
