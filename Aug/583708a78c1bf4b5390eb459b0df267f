IT was the meeting point of two intense life moments: a
dying parent and a wedding day. This is what bride Charlotte Villarin went through last Friday
in Manila, Philippines when she married her loved one as her dad lay dying. Photos on Charlotte’s Facebook page show the joy and the
agony as her gravely ill father lay on a stretcher in the beautifully decorated
church. He held her hand as he wheeled her down the aisle to her
new husband, Maku. Charlotte writes about the hell ride the family had been
on in the month leading up to the wedding. “In and out of the hospital, sleepless nights to take
care of our Papu while thinking and preparing for this wedding, running out of
resources and emotionally, physically and mentally being so exhausted.. I
thought this will not be possible anymore,” she wrote. Her dad, who Charlotte refers to as Papu, died just four
days after the joyous celebration. Charlotte wrote: “This is not your ordinary wedding, not
a fairytale and not as happy as it should be. Thank you to all my family and
friends who showed love not just to me and to Maku yesterday, but most
especially to my PAPU. You made his dream come true. “Your presence made him feel loved and you made him the
happiest man yesterday. “As I always say, this wedding is not just for me and for
Maku. This wedding is mostly for my PAPU. He's been waiting for this moment,
and finally we made it.”
