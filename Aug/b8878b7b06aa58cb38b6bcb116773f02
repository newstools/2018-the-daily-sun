PARENTS of pupils at Buhlebesizwe Secondary School near Kwamhlanga, Mpumalanga say the building has to be renovated. They claimed two pupils and a teacher were injured by a collapsed ceiling. The school was closed on Tuesday in an effort to get the education department’s attention. Charlaine Malope, deputy chairwoman of the SGB, told Daily Sun the school has not been renovated since it was built in 1984. “Bricks are falling out of the walls. When it rains in summer, the classrooms are flooded and books are soaked in water. The school does not have electricity and the roof sheets have rusted. We asked the education department to renovate the school but our pleas fell on deaf ears,” she said. “The school’s pit toilets were destroyed by parents as they also posed a danger to pupils. “The school will remain closed until all these problems have been solved.” Busisiwe Zwane (46), whose child was injured by the ceiling, said her kid hadn’t been to school since Tuesday. A teacher said the situation was affecting learning. “We always have to be alert when we are teaching. My pupils have been injured and my classroom is like a swimmin-pool when it rains. “We can’t do school projects that need electricity and when it’s cloudy, the classrooms turn pitch black. This prevents pupils from seeing what is written on the board.” Education spokesman Gerald Sambo said the department held a meeting with the parents and decided to house the grade 3 pupils at Gugulethu Primary School, which has four vacant classrooms. He said: “The department has instructed the infrastructure team to assess the affected building and establish the extent of the damage. “This will allow us to determine how much money is required for the necessary repairs.”
