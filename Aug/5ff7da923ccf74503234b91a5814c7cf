Mamelodi Sundowns head coach Pitso Mosimane admits that he is jealous of former players Khama Billiat and Leonardo Castro scoring goals for their new club Kaizer Chiefs. Billiat, Castro and Keagan Dolly were Sundowns darling for two seasons (2015/16 and 2016/17) and their deadly combination was coined CBD. They played a crucial role when the Brazilians were crowned champions of the continental showpiece Caf Champions League in 2016. And now all these three players are no longer part of the Masandawana team, Dolly was the first one to leave when he joined French League side Montpellier. In December of the same year Castro also left to join Chiefs. In June this year, Billiat took the same route as the Colombian Castro to join Amakhosi. The two players have been played a key role at Chiefs this season helping the club to reach the semifinals of the MTN8. Talking at the MTN8 press conference Mosimane said: "I'm jealous of that Castro-Billiat combination that's hitting form at Kaizer Chiefs as I worked hard to build that," Mosimane told journalists. "All that is coming now is what used to happen before (at Sundowns). "The only thing that is missing is Keagan [Dolly] on the left, then it would be the complete CBD who led us to league and cup titles which was unbelievable." "But the reality is we have to move on, it's done there's nothing you can do but move on...it's done" On Sunday (3pm), Sundowns host Cape Town City in the second leg of the MTN8 semifinals at Lucas Moripe Stadium. Mosimane said his side will be throwing everything at this weekend's MTN8 semi-final opponents, Cape Town City who are going to this encounter with a 1-0 advantage from the first leg. "We're one game away from a final so I don't think there's much motivation needed for the players. It's a chance to win another cup and at this club we have a culture of winning and we try to win everything."
