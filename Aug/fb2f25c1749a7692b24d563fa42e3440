Umngqungqo Wentokazi celebrated its first anniversary in Kuils River on Friday night. The WOMEN empowerment organisation, mostly made up of married women from all over the Western Cape, came together for life skills and upliftment activities. Angela Dlokweni started the organisation after she realised women were going through a lot. “We invite various speakers because we face different challenges. “Women have lost their identities while trying to keep their families together. “They’ve forgotten their purpose in life, so we come together to remind one another who we were before marriage,” she said. Nosipho Ndamase said she has learnt a lot from other women. “The group helped me rediscover myself,” said the mother of three. “I appreciate the love and support I get from them.” Businesswoman Nwabisa Dlungana (32) of Somerset West said the organisation was a safe space. “It’s exciting to be part of it because we speak about everything. “This is a space where we feel comfortable to boost our confidence and work on ideas for financial independence. “Whether you’re single, married or divorced, love yourselves.” Angela said they hoped to get a financial boost to get their own counsellor as there were many issues they couldn’t solve themselves. She said government services were not easy to access. “It’s very unfortunate that we can’t offer services such as counselling, but we try our level best. “If we could get financial support, we would be very happy.”
