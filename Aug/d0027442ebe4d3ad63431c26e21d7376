A HEARSE carrying a coffin frightened shoppers in the Durban CBD yesterday as it led marchers in the city. But the message behind the hearse was clear. Members of People Against Petrol and Paraffin Price Increase (PAPPPI) were marching against fuel price increases. The march started off at King Dinuzulu Park with just a few members, but more joined in as they proceeded to the Durban City Hall to hand over their memorandum. Onlookers and shoppers were shocked when they saw the hearse. One of the onlookers, Themba Mtolo (34), told Daily Sun that he was shocked when he saw the coffin and didn’t understand what the march was about. But after realising that the march was about fuel price increases, he said he supported it. “The fuel price increases have resulted in an increase in food prices. The bread price has increased and poor people are struggling to feed their families,” he said. The movement's national convener, Visvin Reddy, said the coffin symbolised the death of people due to hunger following the food price increase. “People cannot buy food for their families any more. People can’t even afford to buy a loaf of bread. The fuel price increase is affecting the poor badly,” he said. He said their organisation was formed in June. They demanded that President Cyril Ramaphosa should issue an end to all future increases. “We want to see fuel costs reduced to below R10 a litre,” said Reddy. They handed their memorandum to eThekwini municipal deputy mayor Fawzia Peer, who promised to hand it over to the mayor, Zandile Gumede, for the president.
