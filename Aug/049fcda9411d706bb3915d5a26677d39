IZINYOKA knew they will go to jail when cops pulled them
over. So they sped off in an attempt to get away from cops. But the persistent cops gave chase until they caught them. The izinyoka were travelling in a black Nissan Navara on
the  N4 Road between Brits and Marikana. Cops spokesman Brig Mokgwabone said a car chase ensued
after an attempt by the cops to stop the suspects' vehicle failed. The vehicle was eventually stopped and taken to Mooinooi cop
shop for a search. During the search, the cops found rolls of copper cable
worth R60 000. Cops also found copper fittings, copper pipes and a bag
full of recycled empty cans. Three males aged 31, 35 and 37 were apprehended after
failing to account for the goods. Preliminary investigation revealed that the
empty cans and copper were stolen at a mine's single accommodation. The suspects are expected to appear before the Brits
Magistrates’ Court on Monday, 13 August 2018, for theft, possession of
suspected stolen goods and tampering with essential infrastructure.  The Cluster Commander of Brits, Major General
Modisagaarekwe Mosimanegape lauded the members who were involved in the
apprehension of the suspects for the sterling job.
