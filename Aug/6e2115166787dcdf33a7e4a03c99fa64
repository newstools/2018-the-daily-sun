MORE and more research shows that the way to happiness includes what you eat. Scientists are discovering that the right food can programme the human brain or at least adjust how well it works! Five mood food tips According to Rosalyn D’Angelo, accredited Bupa dietitian, some foods may help to buffer the brain against depression. Manage glucose supply D’Angelo said: “Choose slow-releasing or whole-grain carbohydrates like oat porridge, legumes such as beans, lentils and chickpeas, and fruit and low-fat yoghurt.” These foods provide a slow release of glucose in your body rather than the huge sugar dump that junk food provides. Eat oily fish every four days Studies indicate that depressed people consume less Omega-3 fat. “Omega-3 fatty acids are used in many body and brain processes.” Oily fish has the highest levels of omega-3. The best local oily fish are mackerel, snoek, sardines, pilchards and fresh tuna. Do you get enough trytophan? Tryptophan is an amino acid. The protein you eat is broken down to amino acids the body can absorb and use. The body uses tryptophan to make a special brain chemical called serotonin. This neurotransmitter is the key your brain needs to feel happy, content, relaxed and satisfied. Low levels of serotinin is a sign of depression. Tryptophan is found in poultry, red meat, milk, eggs, nuts, lentils, whole-grain breads, cereals and pasta, soy products and chocolate. Mood food menu Eat a small tub of low-fat yoghurt with a piece of fruit. Add a boiled egg to your salad. Try a tin of small sardines and sliced tomato on whole-wheat bread. Drink a glass of warm milk with a sprinkle of cinnamon. Munch on a small handful of unsalted walnuts with a fresh fruit or two such as an apple or naartjie. A banana is filled with potassium so eat one every day if you can.
