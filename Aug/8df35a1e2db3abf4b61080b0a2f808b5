South African National Civic Organization has called for police stations to be made impenetrable. This came after a robbery which took place at the Kareedouw Police Station in the Eastern Cape. A gang of armed men robbed the cop shop on 4 August and made off with firearms and a radio after overpowering the on-duty officer. Eastern Cape police have launched a manhunt, and a case of armed robbery has been opened. Eastern Cape Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga said that a task team of experienced detectives including the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation and Organised Crime is being activated to track down the thugs. In a statement, Mahlangu said that police stations are community safety centres that are supposed to be unassailable but accessible for services round the clock. “How do communities that are living in constant fear of violent crimes such as murders, cash-in-transit heists, armed robberies and hijacking believe that police are gaining an upper hand over aggravated robberies while marauding gangs are emptying police armouries?” Mahlangu also urged police management to put in place measures that will prevent another police armoury from being robbed. “Police Management must indicate what preventative measures and security review measures have they put in place since the Encobo Police Station robbery incident to make sure that armouries at all our police stations are impregnable because heartless criminals will stop at nothing to access them,” he said. Mahlangu also called on authorities to investigate the robbery. He also urged law enforcement to look into the possibility of it being an inside job, and called on residents to assist the police in catching the suspects.
