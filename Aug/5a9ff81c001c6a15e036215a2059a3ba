DISTRESSED Sassa social grant beneficiaries in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, returned home empty-handed on Wednesday. The Hluvukani Post Office was robbed of an undisclosed amount of cash by five armed men who forced their way in and demanded cash. The drama unfolded shortly after a cash van had just dropped off the money. Shocked officials said the gunmen, who were not covering their faces, threatened to kill them all if they didn’t give them the cash. One of the officials told Daily Sun: “The incident happened 10 minutes after the cash van had left. Gogos were screaming for help. The gunmen were flashing guns and threatening to kill everyone.” Gogo N’waxingulana Mathebula (78) said this was the first time she was receiving her grant money at the post office. “I regret going there,” she said. “We were waiting in the queue when we saw a group of men with guns entering the post office. “We were told to lie on the floor and they demanded cash from the officials. They quickly ran out with a bag full of money.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Abigail Nxumalo said they’re investigating a case of business robbery. “The suspects fled in a white Ford Ranger bakkie with non-compliant number plates,” Nxumalo told the People’s Paper. She urged anyone with information that could lead to the suspects’ arrest to contact police on 013 7730 331.
