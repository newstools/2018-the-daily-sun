Western Cape authorities have made a massive illegal ammunition bust while searching for a murder suspect. Police nabbed two men with 203 rounds of 9mm live rounds inside a Cash and Carry Supermarket in Moonwood Drive, Browns Farm in Nyanda, police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said on Saturday. Van Wyk said officers in the Provincial Organised Crime Investigations Projects, the National Intervention Unit and Provincial Taxi Unit were conducting a tracing operation at the supermarket.

During the search at the premises, members of the [Organised Crime Investigations Projects] recovered the 203 rounds of 9mm ammunition." Van Wyk said the 41-year-old shop owner was also arrested for the illegal possession of ammunition. The duo is will appear in Athlone Magistrate Court next week. Van Wyk said the 30-year-old would appear in Khayelitsha Magistrate Court, on further charges of double murder and attempted murder.
