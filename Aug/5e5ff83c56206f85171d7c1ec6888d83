THEIR business is to make booze flow according to the wishes of the bereaved families. “When a family approaches us, we ask them what the dead person liked, and if they would like to portray that person’s life during their final send-off,” said Sello Aphane (31), the boss of Brothers and Sisters Funerals. “Then we do everything we can to give them what they ask for,” he said. Last week, Daily Sun reported on their grave booze bar, and immediately Mzansi wanted to know who the brains were behind the classy booze festival in the graveyard. Yesterday, Daily Sun spoke to the boss of the funeral home that serves champagne and whisky to help mourners drown their sorrows in style. The business is run by six siblings and is based in Tshwane. Sello said it became famous after the Daily Sun article. “We didn’t even know the funeral was in the paper until we got calls from people,” he said. “The funeral mentioned in the story came after the family told us the dead person loved the finer things in life, and that good booze was part of it.” Sello said the alcohol was for the family only, not for everyone else. Director Lucky Makhubele said they knew the family well. “They should have paid R100 000, but we only charged them R85 000.” Lucky said their most expensive funeral had cost R150 000, but they also catered for low-cost funerals. “But we target those who can afford to pay,” he said. “And whatever the family wants, we provide. “If you want a beach party theme we give it to you!” Sello said the business was started in 2014. But it had taken a long time to get all the details sorted out, including negotiating with the home affairs and health departments.
