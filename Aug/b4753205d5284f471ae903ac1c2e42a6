THE man known as the world's first pregnant man says he
wants to carry another child. Thomas Beatie made headlines in 2007 after he became
pregnant through artificial insemination and gave birth to a daughter. He has given birth to three children, and has since divorced
his first wife and remarried to his current wife Amber Beatie. According to the Mirror, the couple have a son, who was
carried by the current wife. Thomas says he won't rule out going through another
pregnancy himself. But this time he would have to have a Caesarean section
because he has had 'lower surgery' to create a functioning penis. "I would if I could. The issue is we still have frozen
embryos related to this guy [Jackson] here. That's a big decision we have to make. "She [Amber] said if I wanted a girl I'd have to do it
myself and have to carry," Thomas said. "I wouldnâ€™t want to tear anything unnecessarily - you
know what I mean. "Amber successfully carried and she's older. She's 48
right now, so it's still possible for her to do it as well."
