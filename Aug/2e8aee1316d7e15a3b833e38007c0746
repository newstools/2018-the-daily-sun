The Economic Freedom Fighters has its sights set on MultiChoice. This time, the political party is accusing MultiChoice’s selection
process to be flawed and marred by nepotism and corruption. The EFF has called on MultiChoice to make the bid process information
public! Following the announcement that Newzroom Afrika will replace Afro
Worldview, the EFF has released a scathing statement. In the statement, the party accuses MultiChoice of being biased during
their selection process. “The announcement by Multichoice that a new company has been operated
and run a news broadcaster called Newzroom Afrika smacks of corruption,
fronting and wicked influence by forces of evil,” Ndlozi said in the statement. The party demanded that all information and ratings of MultiChoice be
made public. The EFF also believes that many black-owned media broadcasters were
isolated. The party slammed what they believe to be MultiChoice’s alleged corrupt
engagements. They have also accused Multichoice of paying bribes to maintain “their
monopoly position.” “The EFF will write to Multichoice to demand the public release of all
the bid and adjudication process, and further demand that Multichoice be called
to Parliament to account about this process and many other processes,” Ndlozi
said.
