The public broadcaster, SABC, on Friday night released a statement saying that it would not be broadcasting Premier Soccer League matches on its radio stations. "This decision follows careful consideration (of) the SABCâ€™s business operations and the unsuccessful negotiations with the PSL to secure the broadcast rights for soccer matches on radio," the broadcaster said in a statement. "The SABC and PSL could not reach a consensus with regards to the terms of the contract and this has unfortunately led to the SABC not being able to close the deal with PSL." The matches will however still be broadcast on Television.
