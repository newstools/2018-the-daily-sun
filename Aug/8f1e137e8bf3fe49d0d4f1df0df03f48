SADDAM Mhlanga’s kindness led to sorrow – his car was burnt by angry thugs in an act of revenge. He said he used his vehicle to help his neighbour look for his stolen car. But after finding the neighbour’s stolen car, the thugs took revenge and burned his Nissan Stanza. The 58-year-old madala said his car was burnt on Thursday night. A passerby noticed that his car was burning and woke him up. Madala Saddam from Moloto Village near KwaMhlanga told Daily Sun that he was sleeping when he heard a heavy knock on the door and window. After he woke up, the man told him his car was on fire. “The people who burned my car are those who stole my neighbour’s car. We drove around in my car to look for my neighbour’s car. We found it hidden in a farmhouse not far from Moloto. I suspect the thugs took revenge by burning my car. “I used the car to travel around and collect my medication from the clinic. Now I will have to hire a car to go to the clinic,” said the madala. He said he had to wake everyone in the house as the car was parked close to the house. Sergeant Zimkhona Mahlangu said a case of malicious damage to property was opened. She said no one had been arrested and that the police were investigating.
