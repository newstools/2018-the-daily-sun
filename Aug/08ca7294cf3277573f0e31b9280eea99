MASHONISAS often take their clients’ Sassa cards so they can withdraw the money their clients owe them as soon as their grants are paid. But last week the clients decided they were gatvol after three mashonisas withdrew more than they were owed. The people from Duduza, Ekurhuleni, went to the cops to complain and the police raided the house of the mashonisas. However, a gunfight broke out after the mashonisas started shooting at the cops. Luckily no one was injured and the mashonisas were arrested. Captain Harry Manaka of Duduza Police Station said the cops were following up on information about the three suspects, when all hell broke loose. “When the cops knocked on the front gate the suspects started firing shots at them. Cops called for back-up and the three suspects were cornered,” he said. “We urge people not to give their grant cards to mashonisas. It is illegal for loan sharks to take the cards.” Manaka said the cops found Sassa cards, firearms and ammunition. The suspects were arrested and they are facing charges of possession of illegal firearms and ammunition.
