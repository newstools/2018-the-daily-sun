MARITZBURG United chairman Farook Kadodia is looking forward to secure the signature of Mamelodi Sundowns forward Yannick Zakri. Kadodia said he had expected the Ivorian to arrive in the country on Sunday to seal the deal. Said Kadodia: “We have talked to Sundowns and what’s left now is for the player to come back. We need to finalise his personal terms and once it is done and everyone is happy then we will sign him. The deal we are looking at is a permanent one, not a loan.” Added Kadodia: “The only player that we have loaned from Sundowns is (Keletso) Makgalwa. He arrived here (in Pietermaritzburg) on Saturday and he still needs to sort his fitness before he can be featured in the team.” Zakri and Makgalwa are understood to be part of the deal that involved Lebohang Maboe who has gone the opposite direction. The 23-year-old midfielder was unveiled by Sundowns last Friday and the Absa Premiership champions are believed to have coughed out R3 million for his services with Zakri and Makgalwa as part of the deal. The departure of Maboe left a hole in United as was evident when they lost their opening league match 2-0 to Golden Arrows on Sunday. Tomorrow the Team of Choice have another tough assignment as they meet Free State Stars at Goble Park (7.30pm). United coach, Fadlu Davids said he wanted to see his players being more aggressive – especially in front of goal. The Team of Choice was wasteful against Abafana Bes’thende. “Playing good football means nothing if you don’t put that into good use. “Ball possession was ours against Arrows but still we didn’t put the ball in the net. But our next match will give us a chance to correct that. “We are facing a tricky Stars and that is a grudge match for us. They beat us in the last match of the season last year in the Nedbank Cup final. So we need to make good of chances that we create,” concluded Davids.
