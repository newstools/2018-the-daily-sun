THE Durban CBD came to a standstill on Friday as women cops and soldiers marched through its streets. The women were part of a parade organised by Imbokodo Security Cluster. Defence Force members, cops and Metro cops were part of the parade. They marched through Dr Pixley Ka Seme Street and headed towards the city hall. The parade was also attended by schoolgirls. Pupil Sengiphiwe Mpanza (17) from Mkhumbane High School said she was fascinated when she saw the women in their uniforms. “Seeing them made me want to become a cop.” Another pupil, Nelisiwe Shinga (19), said she wanted to work for the Road Traffic Inspectorate. “A lot of people died at the hands of motorists who broke the rules of the road. “I want to work for the inspectorate so I can make sure motorists abide by the rules. “I would also arrest those who break the law,” she said. Mayor Zandile Gumede gave a speech at the end of the parade. Gumede said although Women’s Month was about to end, the struggle for equality continued. “This abuse of women and children must come to an end,” she said. “Anyone who kills or rapes a woman must be thrown in jail. “We are very proud of what Imbokodo Security Cluster has done.” Imbokodo chairwoman Ntomboxolo Thafeni said everything went well. She said a stern message was sent to men who abuse women.
