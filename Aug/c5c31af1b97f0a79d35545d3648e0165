WOMEN from Qunu Village, Mthatha in the Eastern Cape have been given an opportunity to open tourism businesses. This week they received certificates allowing them to run homestay businesses. The Eastern Cape, Parks and Tourism Agency awarded certificates to 24 villagers who have been trained to run homestays. The agency is doing this to help villagers tap into tourism opportunities they can benefit from. Most of the homesteads in the villages have more than one house free and villagers have converted some of them into spaces to host tourists. The agency’s chief operations officer Nomvuselelo Songelwa said they were promoting tourism in the Eastern Cape. “The Eastern Cape is very rich when it comes to tourism. But people of this area don’t take advantage of the opportunities to make money and create jobs,” she said. “There are many tourists who visit Mthatha but people who do tour guides are usually from East London. “I urge the young people of this area to take advantage of these opportunities. You don’t have to go to school to become a tour guide in your area. “You need to be passionate and know about the things that happen in your area.” The agency went to traditional leaders in the area and told them about the business idea. Many women raised their hands to show their interest in the idea. Nokrismesi Xhegwana (42) was one of them. She said: “I don’t know what to say to the agency for giving us this opportunity. We had houses that were not being used. We never thought that they could generate money for us. We have been taught how to look after the businesses. I learnt a lot in the training. “In just a few days, I am going to host 17 people from different countries in my home. I am so excited.”
