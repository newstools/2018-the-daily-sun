RESIDENTS from Maphumulo, northern KZN brought Maphumulo Municipality to a standstill on Monday. They took to the streets, demanding the urgent removal of mayor Zibuyisile Khuzwayo-Dlamini. They accused the mayor of corruption and nepotism. Resident Njabulo Ngubane claimed that job opportunities in the municipality were given to the mayor’s relatives and friends. “The mayor employs her family members, relatives and friends. “When other residents apply for work they are turned down,” he claimed. Njabulo claimed that the mayor was giving tenders to her relatives and friends. “For example, when there are big events around the area that need catering, we often see her kids offering catering services. “This is not fair on other local business people who can do the same job,” said Njabulo. He said they wanted the mayor removed from office because she had failed to provide services such as water and electricity in the area. “There’s also a lack of RDPs in the area.” Mayor Khuzwayo-Dlamini said: “The protest was stirred by people with a personal agenda against me and the current administration. “Most people who were part of the protest are ordinary residents who don’t own small businesses. “They were just used by people pushing their own agenda. “My door is always open for the residents. “Any entrepreneur who is not happy about anything is welcome to come to my office. “We also have structures where people can lodge complaints but nobody has come forward.”
