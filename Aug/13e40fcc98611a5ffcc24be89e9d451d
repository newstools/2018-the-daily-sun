A MAN desperate to get his girlfriend back went a step
too far when he pretended to be her dead mum’s ghost. According to The
Sun, Roy Meadwell (51) from Yeovil, England was dumped by his girlfriend,
Kay Wimbury in 2016. It ended very badly, as Roy attacked her at the time and
had a restraining order taken out against him as a result. But Roy just couldn’t let his obsession go, and in July
2017 cooked up his next plan to win back Kay. He went to a village in Cornwall to
the Willow Moon psychic shop where he met with a fortune teller. He then got the fortune teller to write a letter to Kay
pretending to be from Kay’s dead mum. The letter sings the praises of Roy
without actually naming him, saying things like “he’s the man who sacrificed
everything for you, the man who loves you, the man who wanted you to be his
wife”. It said Kay had made a terrible mistake rejecting him and
urged her, “all you have to do is to call him”. He then posted the letter to Kay. Soon after, he sent an anonymous message from a fake
Facebook account to Kay, apparently from a well wisher, which said: "OMG,
can’t you see the greatness in this man." Kay wasn’t fooled by any of it, and complained to cops
that Roy was violating his restraining order and harassing her. Last week, Roy was found guilty on four counts of
breaking his restraining order at Exeter Crown Court and given a suspended jail
sentence.
