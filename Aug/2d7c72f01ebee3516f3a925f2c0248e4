WESTERN Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula visited the families of two murdered cops at the weekend. The constables were shot and killed in separate incidents in Cape Town last week. They were both off duty when it happened. Jula said: “We are saddened by the sudden deaths of our members. In both incidents, the cops’ firearms were stolen from them.” Constable Lonwabo Kili (30), who was stationed at Bellville South cop shop, was killed in Delft at 8pm on Friday. Constable Siyamcela Ncipa (37), who was stationed at Wynberg cop shop, was shot in the head at a friend’s house in Khayelitsha Site B on the same night. Jula said six cops had been killed in the province since January and arrests had been made in four of the cases. He said more suspects would be bust. “It’s disturbing that criminals have no regard for human life. “But our job is to work around the clock to find the perpetrators,” he said. Constable Kili’s brother, Ntobeko Kondile, told Jula: “We thank you for visiting our family during this difficult time.” The Ncipa family was too traumatised to talk about their loss.
