Top Billing presenter, Masego ‘Maps’ Maponyane is doing his bit to give back and make somebody else’s dreams come true. The 28-year-old hunk recently awarded a young student a R75 000 bursary to complete her studies. Maps has been in close partnership with the Pearson Institute of Higher Education for some time now and now we finally know why. The two brands have created the Maps Maponyane Pearson Bursary fund which aims to offer financial assistance to students at Pearson. This year’s recipient is Molinah Makasana Nkomo who beat out 164 other applicants for the bursary. Molinah is studying towards a BSC in Biomedicine at Pearson. "What a highlight it has been for us to change the life of an individual – who will go on to change the lives of so many others in her future. Congratulations Molinah and we anticipate great things from you,” Maps said in a statement.
