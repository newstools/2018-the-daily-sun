AFRO Worldview, the news channel formerly known as ANN7, will stop broadcasting on 20 August. This is according to a message communicated to DStv viewers, telling them to watch eNCA or SABC for their local news after that date. The message reads: “Dear viewer, please note that Afro Worldview will stop airing on 20 August 2018. You can find local news on eNCA (403) and SABC (404).” The channel’s closure comes a few months after the Afro Voice newspaper was shut down. Workers said their futures were hanging in the balance as they had not been told what would happen to them once the channel had gone off air. Aubrey Tshabalala, the general secretary of the Communication Workers’ Union, told Daily Sun there was a lot of anxiety among the staff. “We have been engaging with MultiChoice about the workers,” he said. Tshabalala said the union had come to an agreement with MultiChoice: that whoever took over the channel left open by the closure of Afro Worldview should employ its staff. He said, however, there were concerns as MultiChoice had not yet announced a new channel. Mzwanele Manyi took over ANN7 and The New Age newspaper from the Gupta family and changed their names. When called for comment, Manyi refused to say anything to the SunTeam.
