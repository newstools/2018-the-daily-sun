SCORES of DA members gathered in QwaQwa, Free State on Tuesday to encourage residents to say no to abuse. Deliwe Mvala-Majola, chairwoman of the DA Woman’s Network in the Free State, told Daily Sun they have received a lot of complaints from women. She said they claimed that men in high positions are demanding sex before employing them. “I am begging every woman to report this,” she said. Mvala-Majola said seeing a lot of men and boys attending the gathering showed that not all men were monsters. “We urge the justice department to keep the men who rape and kill women and children in jail,” she said. Party member Themba Nchaga (33) urged men to take care of their women and children.
