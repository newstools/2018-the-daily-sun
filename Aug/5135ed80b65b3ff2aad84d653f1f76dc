The Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 is less than four months away and already boasting a stellar line-up. In addition to the star-studded line-up of performers and co-hosts, the festival has also announced its “advocates”. The purpose of the festival is to bring artists, world leaders, private sector leaders and ordinary individuals together to make commitments on the issues surrounding extreme poverty Their advocates will help them drive their messages forward so that the right people in places of power can heed the call. Some of the actions on the festival’s agenda include “asking Nigeria’s State Governors to invest in water and sanitation; urge Zambia to help children live free from hunger and malnutrition; calling on the Finance Ministers of Ghana, Tanzania, and Kenya to lift millions from poverty by raising the agriculture budget; and asking Rwanda to help end neglected tropical diseases and improve nutrition across Africa”. Yesterday, the festival announced Nandi Madida, Pearl Thusi, K Naomi, Zakes Bantwini, Somizi, and Maps Mapoyane as Global Citizen: Mandela 100 Advocates. They will take part in the campaign against extreme poverty. For more information on how to join the movement, fans can visit www.globalcitizen.org.za.
