THEY have given the road construction company four days to hire them. They’ve even threatened to shut down the site. Residents of Esikhaleni outside Empangeni, northern KZN, blocked the entrance to the site on Tuesday. They handed a memorandum of demands to the site managers. Resident Chico Langa (32) told Daily Sun they wanted locals only to work on the construction site. “If they come to our area, we must work on the projects,” Chico told the People’s Paper. “We’re also unemployed. They mustn’t bring their friends. There are lots of jobless people here.” The company’s safety officer, Dolo Hlatshwayo, accepted their memorandum. “We knew that they were coming,” said Hlatshwayo. “We’ve had many complaints from them since the project started three months ago. “We knew some people weren’t happy with the hiring process and wanted to stop construction work.” He said management, long before construction started, had asked ward councillors to help the company recruit some locals. “We hired 11 of them as we’re a small team of 15. So we don’t know what more should be done,” said Hlatshwayo. “But management will look at their memorandum and see if they can meet their demands.” But Chico said they didn’t know from a bar of soap the people who had been hired. Ward councillor Samuel Mthembu said he had worked with 10 fellow councillors to identify people who would work on the site. “We only have 11 wards in Esikhaleni, and the company requested us to bring one person per ward,” he said. “So we had several meetings to tell them about the project. “Residents were there after we identified people who would work on the project.” Residents should therefore know the faces of the people working on the construction site, Mthembu insisted.
