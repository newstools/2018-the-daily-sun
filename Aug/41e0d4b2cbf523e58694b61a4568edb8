LIMPOPO police are offering a reward for help that can bust the killers of a former police officer. They are offering a reward of R300 000 for information on the murder of former cop spokesman Colonel Mohlabi Tlomatsana. Tlomatsana was found burned beyond recognition in his Mercedes-Benz in February this year. His vehicle was found parked in the bushes near the R37 road between Lebowakgomo and Burgersfort in Limpopo. The car was discovered by a motorist. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the investigators did their best to track down the suspects, but they were unsuccessful as there was no valuable information. “A decision to offer a reward was made by the provincial police commissioner, General Nneke Ledwaba, in the hope that we will get tangible information to arrest those involved in the murder,” said Mojapelo. Tlomatsana was spokesman for the then Lebowa police. After the 1994 election he was appointed as national police spokesman. He was a pensioner at the time of his death. Cops have assured people that any information received will be treated with confidentiality. Anyone with information should contact Captain Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501 or Captain Matsobane Chuene on 082 414 3345.
