GAUTENG Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane is concerned about the high number of negligent and reckless drivers on the road. “Statistics indicate that the highest number of fatalities are due to excessive speeding by motorists. Our cops will continue to deal harshly with anyone who doesn’t adhere to the rules of the road.” Nkosi-Malobane’s concern came after a motorist was yesterday bust for driving at a speed of 190km/h in a 120km/h zone. “Gauteng traffic police arrested a 31-year-old man for speeding on the R21 in Olifantsfontein. He was driving an Audi A3 and when questioned about his behaviour, he claimed he was rushing to a business meeting,” said Nkosi-Malobane. She said the man was released on R1 500 bail and will appear in the Kempton Park Magistrates Court soon.
