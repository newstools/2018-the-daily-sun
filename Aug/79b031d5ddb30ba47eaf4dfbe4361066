A CROOK who pretended to be part of a group studying to
be priests was lucky to escape with his life after being bust stealing a car
from church. According to Punch,
Gabriel Okani (35) pitched up at Assumpta Cathedral Church of Owerri
Archdiocese of the Catholic Church in the south of Nigeria on Sunday. Okani was
dressed up in the same outfit as the trainee priests about to be ordained. While Archbishop Obinn went through the ceremony in the auditorium
with thousands of people bearing witness, the fake priest snuck out into the
parking lot and drive off in someone else’s car. But fate was against Okani and he was bust at the church
gates by a security guard. All hell broke loose when the would-be thief was hauled
before the archbishop in the church auditorium because furious worshippers
wanted to lynch him. But the Men of God calmed the situation and interviewed
the crook, before calling the cops. An unnamed eyewitness told Punch: “The suspect said he was a serial car thief and specialised
in stealing Toyota brands. He said he wore the priest’s clothes to make people
not to suspect him.” Cop spokesman, Andrew Enwerem said Okani had been taken
into custody.
