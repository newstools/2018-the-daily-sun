THE 2018/18 Premier League season is just around the corner and Chelsea will be looking for an improved showing. After finishing 5th last season, The Blues have missed out on qualification for the Champions League, which ultimately cost former manager Antonio Conte his job despite winning the FA Cup. Replacing the Italian is compatriot Maurizio Sarri who impressed last season in Naples, leading Napoli to a second place finish in Serie A. Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola has also been roped in to assist Sarri. There have not been many arrivals at Chelsea, with Sarri bringing with him from Napoli the exciting Jorginho who signed a long term contract with the London club. The only other addition so far has been third choice goalkeeper Rob Green. Chelsea will open their campaign away at the John Smith Stadium against Huddersfield Town on Saturday 11 August.
