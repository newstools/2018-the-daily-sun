MUSIC is meant for people to enjoy and have a good time. But things have taken a different tune for Bolobedu artist, King Monada, in Limpopo. His fans are complaining that the Ska Bhora Moreki hitmaker is not giving them a chance to breathe. This is because he is releasing hit after hit and they can’t keep up. The fans have now appealed to King Monada to slow down and give them a chance to get used to one song at a time. A fan, John Mohale (27) from Kgapane in Bolobedu, said Kind Monada’s songs are making them drink all their money. “He really needs to slow down. We always look forward to the weekend so we can groove to his music. Some people are now drunkards because of his music. There is no way you can listen to his music and not drink,” John said. But Kgothatso Maepa (22) from Ga-Dikgale outside Polokwane has a different view. “King Monada must continue releasing those hits. He makes good music,” she said. King Monada’s manager Makwela Makwela said they had not received any complaints. “King Monada makes music to entertain his fans and not to make money. That is why he is releasing hit after hit. We still have more hits and we are going to release them one after another.” King Monada’s latest hit is called Bakhegulu le Bakhalabje and features Benito. He became famous in 2016 after releasing Ska Bhora Moreki, which was nominated for song of the year at the 2016 Metro FM Awards.
