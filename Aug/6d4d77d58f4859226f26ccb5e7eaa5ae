HER friends were not surprised when they heard that Nomaswazi was dead. Nomaswazi Nkabinde (24) was allegedly stabbed to death by her boyfriend, Sikhumbuzo Mabaso (42), in her rented room in Umlazi following an argument. Her friend, Zethu Mkhungo (27), told Daily Sun that Nomaswazi, who comes from Eshowe, had been in an abusive relationship with the suspect since 2015. “They used to fight a lot. He was very jealous. He accused her of cheating with our male friends,” said Zethu. She claimed he had beaten Nomaswazi many times. “In November he stabbed her with a bottle and she spent a month in hospital,” said Zethu. She said after Nomaswazi was discharged from hospital in December, friends told her she should end the affair. “She told us she could take care of herself and she knew what she was doing,” said Zethu. She said they forced her to open a case against him but she later withdrew it without telling them. “We thought it was time for us to step back and stop sticking our noses into her affairs.” Zethu said they found out about her death when the man came to tell them to check on Nomaswazi because he had stabbed her. Nomaswazi’s mum, Musa Zungu (65), said: “I wish they had told me that her boyfriend was abusive. I would have tried to rescue her.” KZN police spokeswoman, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said: “A case of murder is being investigated by Umlazi cops. “The motive for the killing is unknown at this stage. “A 42-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with murder.” Sikhumbuzo appeared in the Umlazi Magistrates Court and his case was postponed to 22 August for a bail application. Outside court, angry residents protested against women abuse and demanded that the suspect be denied bail.
