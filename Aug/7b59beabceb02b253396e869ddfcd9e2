BACKYARD dwellers from Kayamandi looted a butcher’s shop in Stellenbosch on Monday. At about 2pm a group of protesters who had occupied Louiesenhof wine farm walked to Stellenbosch after their shacks were demolished. They broke into the DC Meat Market and helped themselves to whatever they could carry. When cops arrived 15 minutes later the protesters had already left. Protester Mthandazo Wili (44) said: “Where do they want us to live? We don’t have land to build houses. They failed to build them for us, but refuse to allow us to do it ourselves.” Stellenbosch Municipality released a statement condemning the incident. “It is becoming increasingly clear that a small group of troublemakers are behind this protest.” “These individuals are taking advantage of the situation by looting and stealing,” it said. “Shop windows were broken, cars were vandalised and stores were looted. “We cannot allow a small group of criminals to hold our businesses and residents hostage. “Looting and the destruction of property are never the answer and will not be tolerated in Stellenbosch,” read the statement. The EFF in Stellenbosch was accused of leading the invasion of the wine farm, but the branch’s leadership denied the allegations. Councillor Derrick Hendrickse said: “The backyard dwellers are behind it. “The occupation was not led by the EFF, ANC or DA. “The protesters did not want me to go there with my beret. They said it was not a political matter.” The backyard dwellers said they are not going to stop fighting for land. “We are doing this for our kids’ future. If it means we have to die, then so be it,” said Jongilanga Dumashe (54). Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said cops were sent in to deal with the matter. “Officers are in the area to maintain law and order,” said Traut.
