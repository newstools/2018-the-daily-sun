IT STARTED when she was still a little girl in her father’s house. She used to join the early morning excitement around the TV to see boxers slugging it out for world titles. Then it seemed fate also had a hand in her future as she met her fiance when he was a professional boxer. Today boxing is still Seromego Dipheko’s passion and she has taken the male dominated sport by storm. She is one of just a few black women boxing promoters in Mzansi and the only one on the West Rand, where she was born and raised in Kagiso, Mogale City. When Seromego met her fiance in 1997, he was a professional boxer. Four years later she and now ex-pro boxer Didi Dipheko tied the knot. “I remember I used to go house to house in our neighbourhood to tell people to watch him on TV during his boxing matches. “I didn’t realise at the time that I was actually marketing and promoting the sport. I did that just to show my suppor.” Later she realised that there was a gap for her as a black woman promoter. Backed up by her experience as Miss Kagiso 1998-’99 and Miss Greater Krugersdorp in 2000, the talented Seromego and her husband launched Team Dida Fitness Hub in 2006 and Team Boxing Promotion in 2011. “As a woman boxing promoter, I would like to change the stereotypical mindset that boxing is a sport for men only. I also want the same respect that men in this field enjoy,” she said. As a boxing promoter, Seromego has hosted seven successful tournaments in Mogale City since 2016. She said that boxing was not a violent sport, but a classy sport meant for gentlemen. “Boxers know where and when to fight. That was in the boxing ring where they could show off their physical strength. They don’t fight on the streets or with women.” Her biggest challenge is a lack of sponsors. Seromego’s ultimate goal is to host global tournaments and have winning champs in her team.
