MUSIC lovers came out in numbers to remember Sir Bubzin. The memorial service was held at eThekwini Community Church yesterday. Sir Bubzin, who was a DJ and producer, died last Friday after a short illness. His family, friends and music colleagues remembered his contribution to the music industry. Artists at the memorial included Joocy, Zakwe, Tzozo, DJ Sox, DJ Kotini and comedian Pastor Mjosty. Tzozo revealed that they started a WhatsApp group of Durban artists in support of the family. He said the group members visited Bubzin’s family on Tuesday, when they gave them an offering of R23 000. “We loved Bubzin so much. We are all heartbroken by his death. The R23 000 that we gave his family is not for funeral costs – it is just an offering,” Tzozo said. One of the neighbours, Mpume Nene, said Bubzin was always calm and respectful. She said they called him Bubu. “We all lost a great child who respected his elders,” said Mpume. Zakwe, who spoke on behalf of the friends, said that Bubzin wanted everything to be in a perfect state. “I loved him so much. I still love him. This love I have for him will be transferred to his children. They should know that they will not suffer while we are still alive,” said Zakwe. He asked other artists to gather Bubzin’s songs and contribute to the release of an album so that his children can be taken care of. DJ Tira said they started working with Bubzin when they were making DJ Cndo’s music. “If you can welcome people into your home, work with them until the morning, it shows you have a big heart,” said Tira. “August is my birthday, but I am starting to hate it because it brings me pain. R Mashesha died in August, and now it is Sir Bubzin.” He revealed that there will be an event at Mashamplanes in Chesterville on 2 September and money raised there will be given to Bubzin’s family.
