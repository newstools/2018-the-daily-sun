LEADER of the controversial Seven Angel’s Church, Banele Mancoba is fit to stand trial. This was revealed by state prosecutor Nomathamsanqa Booi at the Ngcobo Magistrates Court, Eastern Cape yesterday, where the 30-year-old appeared briefly. Mancoba was sent for mental observation at the Komani Psychiatric Hospital last week to check his mental state. During his brief appearance in a packed court room, Mancoba appeared calm. Booi said according to the medical report, he is able to stand trial. She also told magistrate Thobile Bara that investigations in the matter were complete and they were ready for trial. His case results from his marriage to his under-aged wife with whom he has a two-year-old child. The case was postponed for the director of public prosecution’s decision on whether the trial should be held in a regional or high court.
