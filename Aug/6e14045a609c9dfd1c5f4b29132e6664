RESIDENTS call him the mobile fire lighter. That’s because everywhere Jerry Sekgobela (55) has lived, shacks have burned down. Now, residents of Never Never squatter camp in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni want Jerry Sekgobela (55) to leave their kasi. The residents claim that he made a fire last Saturday night and left it unattended. The wind apparently blew the flames towards the rubbish in his yard and in no time 11 shacks were destroyed. “We are tired of losing things we worked for because of someone who is careless. “The fire started from his shack. We tried to put it out but the rubbish in his yard made it impossible,” said Bafana Mfoka. “Jerry is a hoarder. He picks up things from dump sites and piles them up at his place. “Jerry is a risk.” Residents said Jerry was chased out of a squatter camp in Springs after shacks there were burned. He moved to another one in Brakpan afterwards and the same thing happened. Jerry told Daily Sun that he did keep things in his yard but denied causing the fire.
