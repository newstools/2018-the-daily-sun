SPEAKING to Daily Sun, actor Lillian Dube (73) said she was
trying to educate South Africans about sex toys. “It’s better to have seven sex toys instead of seven
makhwaphenis,” said the actor who is known as Sister Bettina from Soul City. She said she is not ashamed that she was trending on social
media because of her seven vibrators. “I have a man that I love and he is very good in bed. The
articles which made rounds on social media won’t make me ashamed. What I am
trying to do is build homes,” she said. “Imagine if your man is diabetic and can’t poke, what should
you do? Should you dump him or cheat on him? No! You should use other means of having pleasure because
you love your man.” She said the social media was meant to be educational not a
sick joke. Dube, who is also a health activist, said South Africans are
behind when it comes to health issues. “They take them as jokes and suffer in the end,” she said. She said someone who owns sex toys is not a pervert. “Before looking for love from others, self-love must be the
first priority,” she said. “It’s strange that people go to taverns to pick up girls and
sleep with them. Some even go to brothels to buy magoshas. But when you try to
educate them, it turns into a joke.” Dube said people lack understanding on serious issues. “Sometimes your man comes home drunk and doesn’t want to
have sex. That’s where a woman must pull out her preferred sex toy and use it,”
she said. “It’s not that I can’t go without sex. I’m teaching that
there is no need to cheat or risk getting Aids by getting poked by people you
picked up from the tavern.” Dube is working on her upcoming movie looking For Love which
stars comedian Celeste Ntuli, who is on the hunt for her soul mate.
