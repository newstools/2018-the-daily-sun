DESPITE being hit by an avalanche of injuries early in the season, Gavin Hunt, coach of the Absa Premiership pacesetters Bidvest Wits, is not pushing any panic buttons. New signing Gift Motupa, along with Daylon Claasen and Granwald Scott are among those in the casualty ward. Hunt said he is targeting free agents, as the management have told him that they don’t have the budget to make further signings after bringing in seven new players, including Deon Hotto, Brighton Mhlongo, Ricardo Goss, Bantu Mzwakali, Motupa and Mxolisi Macupu. Said Hunt: “We don’t have money to bring in new players. I’m told we don’t have enough left in the budget to splash on new players. “We will promote two or three players from our reserve league team or try to look for a few free agents. But they are usually not good enough, are they? “I don’t think I will find a quality player for free out there. The bottom line is that we can’t buy anyone and the frustrating thing is that the injured players will be out for a long time.” Hunt said the only solution that he has for now is to change some players’ positions. He said he has no choice and will have to move some players into positions they are not used to as a short-term solution. The Clever Boys got off to a perfect start in the league, winning three and losing just one match out of the first four. Hunt said the injuries have made him angry, as he is forced to reshuffle his side after such a great start. “What can I do? Do you have a solution for me that I can perhaps use? I don’t think so. “We will change some of the players’ positions. “Midfielders and defenders will have to adjust to new positions – that is the only thing we can do at the moment. We have to use what’s available – there is no money to spend on players.”
