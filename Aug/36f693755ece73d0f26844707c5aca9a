CITY of Tshwane employees had to run for their lives after being attacked by residents on Wednesday. Residents of Nellmapius who were unhappy about service delivery apparently scared officials so badly they fled on foot, leaving behind the vehicles they had arrived in. Municipal spokesman Selby Bokaba said residents attacked employees with stones while they were busy fixing traffic lights on the corner of Solomon Mahlangu and Pretoria roads. He said one official was trapped inside a vehicle while residents attacked it with rocks but he managed to escape uninjured. Three municipal cars were damaged and equipment belonging to municipal employees stolen. “When the team was attacked, they had already planted poles and signal heads and had to leave some cables behind,” said Bokaba. He said what was concerning was that this was not the first incident of this kind in the area. The previous week, Public Works Programme workers were chased away while trying to fix a vandalised traffic light. Bokaba said the team that was attacked on Wednesday was escorted by the police but they also fled when violence broke out. He said vandalism had become a nightmare over recent months. He said a signal pole was cut in Wonderboom last week and would cost between R200 000 and R300 000 to replace. Bokaba called on residents to stop intimidating and assaulting officials and not to damage city property. He said if people continued with their thuggish behaviour, it would make it difficult for the council to respond to service delivery interruptions. Police said no arrests had been made.
