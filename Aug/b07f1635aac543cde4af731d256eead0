ABOUT three years ago she started feeling pain in her stomach and something moving inside her. The 48-year-old woman from New-lands in Durban rushed to the clinic and was given medication – but nothing changed. She told Daily Sun she finally consulted sangomas at the beginning of last year – and she was told she was being troubled by a tokoloshe! “They gave me some muthi, but it did not work and the trouble just got worse,” she said. The woman said the tokoloshe was making her life a nightmare. It even slept with her against her will, she said! “When it happens I cannot see anything with my eyes, but I can tell something is taking place in my body. “It is an uneasy feeling I do not know how to describe,” she said. The woman told the SunTeam the tokoloshe left her alone in the day. She said sangomas told her she had been bewitched with muthi mixed with soil from the grave of an unknown man. She said the tokoloshe slept with her several times a month and she was desperately looking for someone who could end the horror. “I am appealing to anyone who might be able to help me, because I can’t continue to live like this. It is painful! “I have tried everything,” she said. Traditional Healers’ Association president Sazi Mhlongo advised the woman to go to a powerful inyanga. “It might be that she is being troubled by a tokoloshe, but it could also be her ancestors warning her of the dangers of something she is doing wrong,” said Mhlongo.
