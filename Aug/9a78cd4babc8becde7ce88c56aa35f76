BROKEN drains and pipes are flooding their yards, leaving raw sewage everywhere! Residents of Batho kasi in Mangaung, Free State, say raw sewage has been spewing out of broken drains for years. Puseletso Sehloho (32) told Daily Sun they had phoned the municipality to fix the problem several times but their complaints had fallen on deaf ears. “We have been living like this for many years. We have given up hope that we will ever be assisted. “We have been breathing this smelly air for many years.” Another resident, Mathabo Ntatiso, added: “The smell is unbearable. “I have children and I’m worried they will get sick. “Normal people don’t live like this. How long must we wait for a better life?” she asked. “The municipality has forgotten about us. We complained many times, but when municipal workers come, they only fix the problem temporarily. “As soon as they leave, it always goes back to how it was.” Co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC Oupa Khoabane said they have set up teams to check problems in all municipalities. “The teams have started going out to municipalities and we are expecting preliminary reports on the challenges. “If there are capacity problems at this municipality, they will be resolved,” said Khoabane. Mangaung municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said: “We were not aware of the matter. “We will send a team soon to fix the problem.”
