Celebrity couple, Lungile and Bobo Radu are living our summer goals. And when you have money, fame, success and a happy marriage, why not go globe-trotting and chase the high temperatures? The Gaduâ€™s started their baecation in New York City last week, for a taste of the high life in the big apple. Lungile showed fans on Instagram that he is 37-years young and living his best life. They then moved the fun over to Cuba for some island living in Havana. Check out their snaps below: Irengmo 37 ngwaneng..! Lol.
