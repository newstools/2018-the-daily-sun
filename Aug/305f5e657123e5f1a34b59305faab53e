AN elite task team has been put together to probe police station robberies. This after Kareedouw Police Station in the Eastern Cape was robbed on Saturday. Four armed men overpowered the officer on duty and forced him to hand over the keys to the safe. The thugs made off with firearms and a police radio. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said the officer raised the alarm after the group sped off in an unidentified vehicle. A manhunt has been launched for the men and a case of robbery has been opened. According to some publications, the missing firearms include two R5 rifles as well as three 9mm pistols, but Swart refused to disclose any information. She said: “I cannot state the number or type of firearms yet because that is part of our investigation. “Once our investigation has been completed, we will confirm the number of firearms stolen.” Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga condemned the robbery. He called on the community to provide any information that would help police trace the suspects and firearms.
