CHIEF Maano Netsianda has proven he really wants to develop his area. It hasn’t been long since he took over the reins at his village of Tsianda in Makhado, Limpopo. Already he’s bringing much-needed change to the area. Demonstrating his passion for education through his back-to-school programme, he’s given awards to hard-working pupils from five schools. As if that wasn’t enough, the hard-working, humble leader has also beefed up his administration by appointing a new council to help him. Netsianda said as a new leader, he still needed a lot of support and advice to run the huge village. “We need development here, and it can only be achieved if there is proper governance,” he said. “Through this new council, which includes both youth and experienced elders, we hope to achieve that. “Alone, I could not oversee this area. But with the help of these capable people, more can be achieved,” said the chief. “We face challenges here, especially with service delivery and community needs. “These will be our priority areas. Before long, there will be changes here.”
