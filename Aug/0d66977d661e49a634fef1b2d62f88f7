WE HAVE kids to feed! These were the words of frustrated mothers from Sebokeng in the Vaal. The mums protested outside their local Sassa offices yesterday morning. The gatvol mums claimed that for months they had not been receiving their child support grants. Zukiswa Ngcobo (42) said: “I experienced a problem with my ID when I wanted to register my two-year-old child for a grant. “But after resolving the issue I still could not get help. “It has been two years, but I still cannot register my kid for a grant. “We demand our kids’ grants. Every time we come here, we are always turned away,” said Zukiswa. “For months we have been told that their system is not working.” Moleboheng Shiya (18) said she had been sent away several times since her child was born. “Officials always say their system is down. My child is 11 months old and every time I come here, officials do not help us.” She said they were sent to other branches, but when they got there they were just sent back to Sebokeng. Nandi Mosia, a spokeswoman for Sassa, said: “We are not aware of any dysfunctional machines. “Clients who have been turned away should insist on getting the official’s name and request to speak to the local manager,” she said. “Sassa is a national entity and will assist beneficiaries in all areas, regardless of where they live. “The clients should go to any Sassa office with their correct documents and they will be assisted.”
