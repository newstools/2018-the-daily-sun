TO CELEBRATE Women’s Day, Lebowa Funeral Parlour encouraged women to exercise regularly to stay healthy. Lebowa teamed up with the Polokwane Aerobics Fanatics to host its annual aerobics marathon at Seshego Circle Centre, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, yesterday. Hundreds of women of different ages took part in the event, aimed at celebrating the country’s women and promoting a healthy lifestyle. Lebowa marketing manager George Sethosa said the lives of women who fought for democracy should be celebrated. He told Daily Sun he believed the marathon would bring women together so they could fight for their rights. “It’s a pity that most young girls have chosen a life of drugs and they’re not exercising regularly,” said Sethosa. “This can affect their bodies in a bad way. We believe that, with a healthy mind and body, we can help build our country. “We want our people to live healthy lifestyles so they can live longer. “There are many diseases that affect us because we don’t exercise regularly. “We’re happy that old people continue to participate in this marathon, and we believe through their presence we can build a healthy nation.” Polokwane Aerobics Fanatics chairman Semakaleng Mabeba said it was important for people to exercise every day to stay healthy and fit. “We believe exercise will also help reduce things like obesity.” He said it was important for people to stay active throughout their lives.
