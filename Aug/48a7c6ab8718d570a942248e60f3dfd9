MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has vowed that his side will avenge the two league defeats they suffered at the hands of Polokwane City last season. The teams battle it out in an Absa Premiership match at Peter Mokaba Stadium today (7.30pm). Mosimane hopes his players will improve after being held to a 1-1 draw by Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs in their opening league game of the season at Loftus Versfeld at the weekend. The 3-2 and 2-1 defeats at the hands of Rise and Shine still haunt Mosimane who aim for a better performance this time. Said Mosimane: “Polokwane beat us twice, so we are going there to get more than we’ve got (against Chiefs) here.” On the other hand, Polokwane coach Josef Vukusic says his boys are not scared of the eight time PSL champions. City failed to win their opening league game having lost 1-0 to Black Leopards at home. “This will be a good game,” said the Slovakia born mentor, who joined the Limpopo side this season. “Sundowns are a big team and have quality players, everyone knows that. But we are looking forward to this game and we’re not scared of them. It will be a tough game I am sure about that.” He added: “We will use this game to see how far we are in our preparations for this season as we will be playing the PSL champions. All we have to do is to play our normal game and in football anything is possible. We are going into this game with positive attitude and with the belief that we can do it.” Vukusic will rely heavily on his captain Jabu Maluleka and last season’s joint leading goalscorer, Rodney Ramagalela, to rub more salt into the PSL giant’s wound. Mosimane will pin his hopes on the likes of Hlompho Kekana, Gaston Sirino, Jeremy Brockie and Themba Zwane to upset Polokwane.
