SICK people have to queue at the clinic from 4am if they want to be helped on time. But this is not because the clinic is full, but because it’s a mobile clinic that only comes on Wednesdays for a few hours. The elderly, women and children stand in long queues waiting for their turn at Sunrise Park Clinic in Sunrise Park, near Rustenburg, North West. They are suffering because the local clinic was burned during service delivery protests in May last year. After the clinic was burned, residents had to travel to neighbouring kasis which caused even more overcrowding. Those who can’t travel have to wait for the mobile clinic. According to North West Department of Health spokesman, Tebogo Lekgethwane, government is unable to rebuild the clinic. He said this was due to a serious backlog in infrastructure and maintenance. “The Bojanala district and department are experiencing serious budget pressures and we are still trying to locate a source to fund the torched clinic,” said Lekgethwane. He said the cost of repairing the facility, including enhancing security features, is estimated at R2,2 million. He said building new facilities and maintenance of old ones was done through a pre-planned budgeting process. “Once facilities that were not within the budget plan are burnt down, it becomes difficult to find a budget to accommodate that structure within the limited budget resources on hand.” Lekgethwane said residents must remember that it is patients who suffer when health facilities are destroyed. “These patients are members of their community, even close family members. Please help safeguard health facilities during protests of any kind,” he pleaded.
