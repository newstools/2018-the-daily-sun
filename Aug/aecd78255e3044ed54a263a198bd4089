GIVE us flats or we’ll take them by force! That was the threat made by Durban central residents yesterday when they marched to eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede’s offices. They demanded to see her or Mondli Mthembu, head of human settlements at the municipality. The group of residents calling themselves the Ward 26 Civic Association vowed to occupy flats along the beach if the municipality failed to give them places of their own. Association leader Gugu Sibiya said they’d been waiting since 2011 to be given their flats. She said municipal officials were selling flats to businesspeople, who turned them into student residences. That’s why they had decided to stand up and fight for their rights. Sibiya said government bought three flats for ward 26 residents in 2011 after they complained they were voting but not benefiting. “We can’t wait any longer. We need our flats, otherwise we’ll occupy them by force. “We know the flats were bought for us, but they’ve been standing empty since 2011 because the municipality has been refusing to let us in,” said Sibiya. Another resident said they were reliably informed that officials bought some of these flats and used their friends as friends. She said corrupt officials were planning to turn the flats into students’ residences. “They had a strategy,” the resident told Daily Sun. “They came to tenants and asked them to leave so that the building could be renovated and sold.” The association’s memorandum of demands was accepted by human settlement committee chief whip, Mpume Sithole. Sithole said she would discuss the memorandum with the committee and respond within 14 days. She assured marchers that their allegations that flats were being sold would be investigated.
