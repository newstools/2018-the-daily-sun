IT STARTED with just two shacks – but now the number has grown! Squatters have taken over Bakgomana Primary School in zone 3 Diepkloof, Soweto, since April. Some of them are living inside the classrooms, while others live in shacks on the school premises. There are about 50 shacks so far, but more people are preparing to move in. The squatters said they are not leaving, despite legal steps taken by the Gauteng Department of Infrastructure Development to have them evicted. Community leaders Patrick Mokgotho and Thami Dlamini said they would not leave until they were given an alternative place to live. “This school was dilapidated and it housed nyaope addicts and thugs,” said Patrick. “We could not sit and watch it get wasted while we had no place to live. “We hear rumours that some people are now eyeing the school and want to build flats to make money for themselves.” Bakgomana is one of many schools abandoned when pupils were transferred to other schools because there were too few of them. Jacob Mamabolo, infrastructure development MEC, told  Daily Sun  the provincial government was going to partner with the private sector to put abandoned schools to good use, and this is why squatters were being evicted.
