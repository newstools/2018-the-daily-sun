POLOKWANE City FC head coach Josef Vukusic says his charges can’t wait for the 2018-19 Absa Premiership season to start. Rise and Shine face newly promoted Black Leopards in a Limpopo derby at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (6pm). Vukusic, who joined City two months ago, says his boys are ready to face Lidoda Duvha. “We’ve completed our preparations for the new season and I was pleased with the response I got from the boys during pre-season,” said 53-year-old Slovakian mentor. “We played eight friendly games and did well. The players understand my tactics and how I want them to play. I am confident we will have a good season.” He added: “Physically and mentally the players are in a good place. Let’s wait and see what happens on Saturday.” City had a dismal run last season, only avoiding relegation with their very last league game. But the former FC Cape Town head coach promised a better performance by Rise and Shine this season. Commenting on the derby, Vukusic said: “Everywhere in football a derby is always exciting and tough. This game is not only about the three points but also about bragging rights for the fans. We have to be strong and ensure we do not disappoint our fans. It would also be good for team confidence to win our first league game.” Vukusic said all his players were available and fighting for a place in the starting lineup. “The only problem I have is who to play – all the players have displayed impressive commitment,” said Vukusic “It will be tough for us as the technical team to choose a starting lineup.”
