THE Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport says repairs
on the R55 in Laudium. In the west of Pretoria have begun. In April, a sinkhole formed on the busy route, following
that sections of the route were closed off. The Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport spokesperson
Melitah Madiba said the department investigated remedial repair methodologies
to accelerate repairs on the road. “Following a detailed dolomitic stability survey conducted
by geotechnical experts, the estimated cost for the repairs is R12.1 million,”
Madiba said. “The results of the seismic survey and drilling programme
together with proposals for rectification were submitted to the Council for
GeoSciences (CGS) for approval.” “CGS is mandated to develop and publish world-class
geoscience knowledge products and render geoscience-related services,” Madiba
added. “A Departmental team of experts has been monitoring the area
around the sinkhole for the past ten weeks, and no further settlement or
movement was recorded during this time,” said Madiba. The team has commenced to pour concrete into the throat of
the sinkhole, an exercise meant to throttle the sinkhole so that no further
collapse can occur, particularly during rainy seasons. “With the throat throttled, the process will commence to
stabilise the area through dynamic compaction to collapse whatever unstable
ground there is within the immediate surrounds. Suitable fill material will
then be imported and compacted until the area is totally stabilised and
returned to ground level. Motorists have been urged to utilise alternative routes
during when continued on the route.
