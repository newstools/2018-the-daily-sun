THE Free State Education Department is like a three legged pot, with SGBs forming one of the legs to make sure things don’t fall over. Education MEC Tate Makgoe and Premier Sisi Ntombela honoured outgoing and new SGB members at a ceremony held on Saturday at the University of Free State’s southern campus in Bloemfontein. The purpose of the event was to thank the outgoing members of the SGBs for their selfless service to the cause of education and to welcome 18 000 new members who took office in April. Makgoe said the term of SGBs was normally three years. The MEC said it was perhaps time to introduce incentives for those SGBs who performed well, in the same way his department rewarded teachers and principals. “We want to include SGBs in this three-legged pot of education,” said Makgoe. SGBs for both secondary and primary schools were present. Ntombela pleaded with education officials and teachers to make the province proud by reclaiming their number one spot in the matric results. Mtshutshisi Phaku, outgoing provincial chairman of SGBs, encouraged the new members to be guided by the South African Schools Act. “The main challenge you will face is parental involvement. Some parents don’t support their children and don’t even attend the meetings. “As SGB members, you will also need to have one-on-one engagements with pupils to understand their problems. Our main aim and responsibility is to ensure our children perform well,” said Phaku.
