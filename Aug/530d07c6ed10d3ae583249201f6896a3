VERONICA Ntenjana is afraid to take taxis. The 39-year-old from Tshwane said she was moered by a driver for not hailing his taxi earlier. She told Daily Sun she was dragged out of the taxi on Wednesday and thrown down on the ground in front of other passengers. She said she had just come out of a taxi from Parkview, where she works, and was getting into another one at an exchange point. “The taxi I had boarded in Parkview was going to Marabastad while I was heading to the CBD. “Three of us were then switched to another taxi going to the CBD.” She said she was surprised when the driver of the taxi told her to get out. “When I told him he should have told the driver he didn’t want me, he said he would show me who he was,” she said. Veronica said the driver accused her of thinking she was better than others. “He said I had earlier avoided his taxi in Parkview because I think I’m beautiful. “I didn’t even see him or his taxi. There are many taxis here and I can’t recognise them all,” she said. Veronica said while they were still arguing, the driver grabbed her by the neck and slapped her. “I screamed for help and he threw me on the street. He then sped off, but through the pain and tears I wrote down his registration number.” Veronica said she reported the man to the police and his taxi association. “He has not been arrested or questioned. I’m afraid he might attack me again because I still use taxis.” Captain Daniel Mavimbela said cops were investigating a case of assault.
