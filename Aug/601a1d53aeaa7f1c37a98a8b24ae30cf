Single mums Phumla Sitokwe and Manthabeleng Ramahodi (both 47) started a side business to take care of their families. The friends, who work as pickers on fruit farms in their home town of Grabouw, outside Cape Town, were always broke in dry seasons. “There were times when we did not work for about six months on the farms. That is why we decided to start this business, so when there was no work for us we could still make an income,” said Phumla. The friends run a sewing business in which they make beautiful necklaces with beads. They also use the beads to decorate nets to cover food. Their beautiful hats are made from recycled plastic. They charge about R50 for their smallest items. They urged other women not to depend on men to support them financially, but to stand up and work for themselves. “We do not have any men in our lives. We are working hard for our kids,” said Phumla. “Some men abuse women because they know they depend on them financially,” she said. Manthabeleng said: “We want to tell women they can survive without men. They do not have to stay in abusive relationships just because they do not earn an income.” They said they sometimes supply their products to people who resell them at higher prices. “We are open to this type of offer because sometimes people buy stuff from us for R50 and then sell them for more. We do not mind, as long as they pay us what we charge,” said Phumla.
