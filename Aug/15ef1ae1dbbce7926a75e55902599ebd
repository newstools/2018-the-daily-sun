PUPILS at Thabeng Primary School in Evaton, Vaal, have been without water since June. Parents and teachers have tried to come up with solutions to make sure normal learning continues. Oupa Tladinyane, an SGB member, said parents and teachers had met to talk about the issue. “But most of the solutions have not worked,” said Oupa. “We often release pupils as early as 11am so they can use toilets at home because the school toilets are filthy.” But some parents said they were not happy because no one was taking care of their kids while they were at work. Oupa said a decision was then taken that each pupil should bring a two-litre water bottle to school. Parent Nomathemba Booi told Daily Sun the children were suffering because of the water problems. “Our kids are suffering because of this unresolved issue,” she said. “My child is in grade R and carries a water bottle to school every day. A decision was taken to install water tanks, but this has not happened yet.” She said the kids are at risk of getting sick. Oupa said they were waiting for approval from the education department to install the tanks. “We hope the tanks will be installed by the end of this month,” he told the People’s Paper. Education spokesman Steve Mabona said the department was talking to the municipality to resolve the issue. “In the meantime, we will deliver water tanks as a temporary measure until the issue is resolved, because this is a health hazard for the pupils. “We hope to fix this water crisis soon.”
