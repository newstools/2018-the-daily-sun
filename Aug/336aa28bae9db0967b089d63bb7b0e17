SEBENZILE Myende (13) was walking home from school when she was allegedly snatched by unknown men who threw her in the boot of a car and sped off. Her family had heard about the incident from a friend who was walking with Sebenzile when it happened. Sebenzile from Magabheni, south of Durban, was kidnapped on 25 July. Her sister Simangele (23) said the friend told them they had just got off a bus when the unknown men pounced. “The friend said she couldn’t remember the make of the car and didn’t even take down its registration number because she was scared,” said Simangele. “We then started looking for Sebenzile, but with no luck. The following day we went to the police station and reported her missing.” Simangele said a man told residents he had heard people saying they knew where Sebenzile was being held hostage. “He told us my sister was being kept in KwaMakhutha,” she said. “We informed the cops but they couldn’t find Sebenzile at that place. “We continued searching at hospitals and mortuaries but couldn’t find her.” She said they hadn’t lost hope of finding her alive. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a missing person’s docket was opened at Umkomaas Police Station.” Zwane appealed to anyone with information about Sebenzile’s disappearance to contact Umkomaas police on 039 973 6107/8.
