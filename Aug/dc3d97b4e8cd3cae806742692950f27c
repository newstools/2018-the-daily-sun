A SHACK fire in Makhaza, Khayelitsha left a family of four with nothing on Monday. The Mkhaza family was not present when the fire started at about 9am. It is alleged that someone was making themselves warm but did not completely put out the fire when they left. Neighbour Mninawe Joni said he was frightened when he saw smoke coming from the house. “We are not used to fires around the area since we do not have many shacks. Almost everyone was at work and I called those I could see to come and help because I was worried that the fire might spread to other houses.” Firefighters arrived but the fire had already swallowed the four-roomed shack with everything inside. Mninawe said Michael Mkhaza, the owner of the shack, could not be told of the tragedy until he returned home as they were worried he would not take the news well. When the father of two returned home with his daughter (22) they found their home in ashes. “I could not move when I saw what happened. I looked around to see if I was in the correct street. I could not believe it. I left my house standing. Now it’s in ashes,” said bus driver Michael (56). Third year student at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology Siphokazi Mkhaza lost her books and clothes in the fire. City of Cape Town’s Fire and Rescue Service spokesman Theo Layne said the cause of the fire was unknown. The family is pleading with anyone who can assist by donating clothes and books for the events management student to come forward.
