IF YOU suffer from a runny tummy, you must stay away from this little town in Eastern Cape. That is because Whittlesea has only six public toilets – and they are all blocked. People visiting Whittlesea have to hold the call of nature in, or risk being robbed or bitten by snakes when they go into the bush to relieve themselves. Residents told Daily Sun the toilets have been blocked for more than five years, but the Enoch Mgijima Municipality has failed to resolve the matter. The bush is about a kilometre away from the town. Athenkosi Mlando sells fish and chips in the town. She has a container near the Whittlesea Taxi Rank. She said they raised the toilet issue with the municipality, but did not get any help. She told the People’s Paper she would often get into fights with people who wanted to hide behind her container to pee. “This is frustrating. There are times when I will find an elderly woman peeing behind my container. “As much as it is bad for my business, I cannot chase an old person away, and the bush is far,” Athenkosi said. “People in this town are so used to not having toilets. “The first two toilets were built in 2012, then another four were built in 2013. But none of the toilets has worked for more than a year,” said Athenkosi. “We spoke with the municipality in 2016 after elections, and again last year. This year we decided not to bother them again.” A taxi driver said he no longer relieved himself in town. Fundile Feketshane, a spokesman for the municipality, said the municipality would look into the matter.
