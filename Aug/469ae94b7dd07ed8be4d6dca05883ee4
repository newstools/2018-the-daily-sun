Celebrity designers are fast becoming the next big thing not just in South African fashion, but also in pop and celebrity culture in general. They hold the honour of making our most cherished personalities look and feel their best at all times. From red-carpet events, to press appearances, performances, or just day-to-day style, most celebs would be lost without their go-to designers. And as sought-after as they are, celebrity designers usually have that one particular face that becomes their muse, the one who wears their designs to every single event and becomes known as a “Gert-Johan Coetzee girl” or a “David Tlale girl”. Sometimes the designer and the celeb meet each other at the peak of their careers creating an unexpected explosion on the fashion scene such as in the case of David Tlale and Lalla Hirayama. But other times, the designer and celeb meet before becoming “household” names, they get to know each other and over the years they create a match made in fashion heaven, much like we will one day discover from the relationship brewing between Antherline and actress, Mo Setumo. Here are our top 5 favourite celebrity-designer pairings: 5. Quiteria & George and Dineo Moeketsi So ne gole monate but the people must get what they want...
