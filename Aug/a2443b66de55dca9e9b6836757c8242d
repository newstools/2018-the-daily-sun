ALL the doctor wanted was to help patients. But now he is spending his days at home, he claims because he was unfairly treated. Dr Madumetja Mgodini (45) from Odi District Hospital in Mabopane, Tshwane claims he was suspended for no reason. He said his only crime was to stand up for patients by asking hospital management for more equipment as the hospital was struggling to keep up with patients’ needs. He said the equipment was often faulty, which made it difficult for doctors and nurses to do their job. He said he was suspended in November last year for raising his concerns and was also accused of fighting with a nurse in the maternity ward, which he says never happened. The doctor told Daily Sun that he wants to be moved to a clinic because he can no longer take the strain. Odi Hospital spokeswoman Nombulelo Shangase said the allegations were not true. “It is to be noted that hospital management is not in possession of any complaints from Dr Mgodini about issues affecting the hospital.” Shangase said management was currently discussing a move from the hospital with Dr Mgodini.
