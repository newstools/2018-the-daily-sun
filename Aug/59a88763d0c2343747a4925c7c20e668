THEIR gospel hits have taken the gospel music industry by storm. But popular Abathandwa Music Group have apparently also kicked up some dust as negative publicity keeps hanging around. The group, which records under Ncwane Communications, has been the subject of negative publicity on both social media and in print. Group leader Percy Nyawo was highly criticised after he was seen wearing the late S’fiso Ncwane’s clothes. This only added to the fire of rumours that he and S’fiso’s widow, Ayanda were having an affair. Percy told Daily Sun the group wouldn’t allow the devil to shake their faith. “My fellow group members and I come a long way together. We all are from the poor backgrounds and now that our music careers are blossoming and our lives are improving, the negativity comes our way. “We will not allow that to demotivate us. The devil is a liar,” said Percy. Their popular single track Ehhe Moya Wam from their album titled Amagatsha (leaves) has also been criticised by music fans on social media who claimed that it’s “isinesicefe” (it is now annoying). But Percy said even such criticism failed to demotivate them. He said: “We have noticed the memes and videos posted by people saying that they are tired of our song, but I think those people are just haters who were sent by the devil to demoralise the work of God. “We are stronger than before. Criticism is a proof of our hard work and MamNcwane (Ayanda Ncwane) is constantly training us on how deal with negative things that come with the industry. “She always tells us that when you’re doing good, the devil will try to discourage you.” He added that they were looking forward to submit their entries for the nominations of this year’s Crown Gospel Music Awards.
