SIPHO Zingisa is a worried man. The 44-year-old from Lenasia, south of Joburg is looking for his 20-year-old daughter. He said his ex-girlfriend, Thandi Hlatshwayo, went to visit her home in KZN with their daughter, Sphumulile Hlatshwayo, who was six months old at the time. Sipho said he has been struggling to trace Thandi or his daughter. “I’m having sleepless nights and I can’t cope at work. “My bosses have started noticing that my work is slowing down,” he told Daily Sun. “I’m also worried that I have to perform ancestral rituals for my daughter so she could be accepted by my ancestors. I am concerned that she might be facing challenges in life because of my ancestors. I just want the best for my daughter.” Sipho said he hoped SunReaders would help him find his child. “I need to find my daughter. Please help me.”
