THE Ndebele people are angry and say they want their land back! This was what a group of Ndebele people told the Land Claims Commission in Tshwane on Monday after arriving in a bus. They marched to the department of land reform and demanded that the government stop calling them foreigners. Makhonjwa Mlala (51), a tribal co-ordinater in Wallmannsthal, near Hammanskraal, said they were a big community and had left many members at home to avoid causing havoc in Tshwane. “What pains us as the Ndebele is that the rural development department is giving other people our land,” he said. Mlala said it was just the beginning of their battle for land. He appealed to the department to thoroughly read their memorandum and respond. He said they demanded that the issuing of title deeds be stopped immediately as their land was being given to illegal buyers. “The right thing is to save everyone’s time by giving us back our land,” he said. Mlala said the Ndebeles wanted chief land claims commissioner Nomfundo Gobodo to give them a single title deed for the whole of Wallmannsthal, according to findings made by the commission in 2014. They also demanded that the commissioner retract a statement made at the Premier Hotel last year calling the Ndebele amakwerekwere. Mlala said King Makhosonke Mabena II claimed the whole area of Wallmannsthal for his people between 1994 and 1998. Regional land claims commissioner Lebjane Maphutha received the memorandum and said they would respond within 14 days.
