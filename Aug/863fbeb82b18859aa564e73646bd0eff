DRIVING or even walking home after a night of heavy drinking is never the safe or right thing to do. Those who do run the risk of getting killed – but some kasi tavern owners have had a brilliant idea. Patrons at Maria Maria Tavern in Kwa-Thema, Ekurhuleni, who have had too much booze will get a free ride home – compliments of the owners! For about two years now, sisters Ruby Mathe (51) and Onicca Sobopha (52) have been transporting their customers for free. And this, they say, has earned them even more customers. “People are now streaming to our tavern because we know how to take care of them. Our tavern is not far from an open space where many lives have been lost. “In most cases we take women home and people who arrive here without transport.” Ruby said they transported the customers to Tsakane, Duduza, Kwa-Thema and other areas in Ekurhuleni. Happy customer Seun Nkuna said the women even allowed the patrons to leave their cars at the tavern when they had too much to drink, and to collect them the next day. Emily Khutso said she liked visiting the tavern because she knew she was in good hands. Onicca said some local tavern owners did not want them around because they believed they lured their customers. “It is simply a matter of taking care of our customers, nothing else,” she said.
