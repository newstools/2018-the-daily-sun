A 52-YEAR-OLD mother from Effingham, north of Durban whose family members have no IDs, believes she was cursed. Ntombikayise Manzi (52) lives in a three-room shack with her daughters Philile (36), Samkelisiwe (15), Phindile (18) and son Siyabonga (30) as well as seven grandchildren. None of them have IDs. Ntombikayise, who is originally from Ndwedwe, told Daily Sun that she had tried for over 30 years to get her ID. She said she started applying when she was 20 years old. She said officials from Home Affairs had told her to keep applying. Ntombikayise said as a result her chidren couldn’t apply for their IDs and their children’s birth certificates. “I believe I was cursed while I was in my mother’s womb. I’m worried about what will happen when I die. We are like foreigners in our own country. We can’t enjoy benefits like social grants and voting. “No one is working and the kids can’t get social grants because they don’t have birth certificates. My children couldn’t finish school because they didn’t have birth certificates and IDs,” she said. Sassa spokesman Vusi Mahaye said he would send social workers to the family. KZN Home Affairs manager Cyril Mncwabe said he would personally deal with the matter. He asked the family to come and see him in his office.
