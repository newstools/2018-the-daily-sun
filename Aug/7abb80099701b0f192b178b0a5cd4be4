ABAHLALI BaseMjondolo have revealed that their leader has been receiving death threats. Chairman of the Barcelona 2 transit camp in Lamontville, south of Durban, Thapelo Mohapi, and local council members were being threatened by unknown men. General secretary Thapelo Mohapi said the men vowed to remove the leaders if they continued mobilising in the area. He said they suspected the threats came from a councillor, who had apparently said on many occasions she wouldn’t tolerate Abahlali. Mohapi told Daily Sun: “In an open community meeting, the councillor openly attacked our chairman and threatened him. “Two days later, the local council was threatened by men who said they were from the notorious Unit 17 Hostel in Umlazi.” He said the threats directed at their chairman and local leaders in Barcelona were serious. “We can’t afford to lose another life. If anything happens to our chairman or any member of the local council, we will hold the councillor personally liable,” said Mohapi. Mohapi previously told Daily Sunthey had not reported the death threats to the cops as they had lost faith in them. Councillor Sibongile Khanyile said: “Those are very serious allegations and I’ve never said such things.” She encouraged Mohapi to report her to the cops if she had proof.
