ANTI riot police officers in Zimbabwe had to secure the
Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) headquarters in Harare, after MDC
supporters began protesting. MDC supporters say the elections are rigged. The EU's chief observer Elmar Brok says the longer it takes
for the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to release the presidential election, the
more credibility it loses. Vendors in the streets of Harare had to quickly pack their
merchandise as protesters approached and shops were forced to close business.
