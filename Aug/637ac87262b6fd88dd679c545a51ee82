THE police are taking illegal mining seriously. Between April and last month, 47 suspected zama zamas have been arrested in Allanridge, Free State. The arrests were made thanks to a joint operation between cops, Protea Security, mine security, the tactical response team, public order policing, crime intelligence and the cluster crime combat team. Welkom cluster commander Major-General Lerato Molale applauded the members for doing a good job. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said: “This is an ongoing operation to clamp down on the illegal mining happening in the area. “Between April and last month, 47 people were arrested for crimes like illegal immigration, possession of gold-bearing material and theft of gold-bearing material.” Thakeng said they had confiscated gold-bearing material weighing 243 637kg with a street value of over R2 million. They also seized 11 vehicles in the raid.
