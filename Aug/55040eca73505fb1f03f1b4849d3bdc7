LABOUR unions will march from the Vuyani Mabaxa Park to the Chris
Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital on Monday morning. The unions say the march is over the rife corruption which
has crippled healthcare service at the hospital. The unions DENOSA, HOSPERSA, NEHAWU, NUPSAW, NPSWU and PSA,
will meet with the Head of Department, Prof Lukhele to demand the release of a report
investigating rife corruption at the hospital. According to the unions they also want the acting CEO to
step down, vacant posts to be filled and fair employment opportunities for
everyone. “The results of corruption at the hospital have led to what
has become sub-standard healthcare at the facility to patients, as service
malaise manifests in the following ways,” the unions said. The acting CEO has been accused of irregular appointments,
interfering in the employment process to ensure certain officials are employed
and selling of jobs by those close to him. “The facility’s Labour Ward staff is made up of 12 midwives
in total which works out to be three midwives per shift in a unit with
statistics of more than 2000 deliveries per month.” The unions say this is equals to unforgivable abuse of staff
and they added that the patients delivering without supervision is inevitable.
