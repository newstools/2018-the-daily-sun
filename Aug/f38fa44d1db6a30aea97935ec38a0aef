MORE than 150 residents from Dindini Village gathered at a sports field near Mbizana yesterday. They were demanding the release of six suspects who allegedly killed a 53-year-old interim chief. Thulani Mkanyelwa was killed on Sunday at about 11am. His house was vandalised and all his furniture was torched. Some residents accused him of being rude and failing to communicate with the people. Residents at the sports field refused to speak to the media. Chief Jongamampondo Mditshwa said he was called to Mkanyelwa’s home after community members took him from his home to the nearby veld, where he was stabbed with his own spear and set alight. Mditshwa said they were not sure what the real reason for the killing was. “There are many issues including the community demanding to have a headman. A tavern that the dead man wanted to take over is one of the suspected reasons for the murder. “We are very disturbed by the incident and have asked the police to restore peace,” said Mditshwa. Police spokeswoman Captain Edith Mjoko said six suspects aged between 28 and 57 had been arrested. “The deceased was allegedly an interim chief in the area. A group of people held a meeting and proceeded to the chief’s homestead afterwards, where they fatally stabbed him with sharp objects and burnt his body,” said Mjoko. “They face charges of murder and malicious damage to property and will appear in the Mbizana Magistrates Court soon.”
