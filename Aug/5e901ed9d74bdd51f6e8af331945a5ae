THE thug was wanted for a string of crimes including murder, attempted murder, rape, robbery with a firearm and stock theft. Police launched a manhunt but he managed to evade them for two years. But the 32-year-old’s luck finally ran out on Tuesday when cops nabbed him in Bajodini Village, Qumbu. Police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said: “He was found in possession of an R1 rifle with eight live rounds, a 12 bore shotgun with three shells, a 9mm pistol with 97 rounds, two empty pistol magazines, a pellet gun, bush knife, binoculars, eight cellphones and 1kg of dagga.” She said there was also a possibility the suspect was linked to other cases of stock theft in and around Qumbu. “The firearms will be sent for forensic analysis to establish any links to other crimes.” The man will appear before the Qumbu Magistrates Court later this week. He is facing charges of possession of unlicensed firearms, unlawful possession of ammunition, drug possession as well as possession of suspected stolen property. Acting cluster commander Brigadier Nomawethu Makonza commended the officers who made the arrest. She said: “You can run, but you cannot hide from the law. “This arrest is a warning to all criminals.”
