A FURIOUS dad caused chaos at Leratong Hospital in Krugersdorp on Wednesday over alleged slow service. It happened when he brought his three-year-old son to hospital after a car accident. In the incident captured on video, the father threatened one of the woman doctors. He can be heard insulting her, saying he doesn’t speak to women. Another man can also be heard threatening the doctor. “I will wait for you outside. We’ll show you,” he says. Hospital security tried to prevent the angry men from attacking the doctor. According to hospital CEO Grey Dube, the boy sustained head injuries. “The child was seen by the doctor, taken for a scan and sent back to the emergency unit,” said Dube. “The father said he was unhappy with what he thought was a delay in service and demanded to take the child to another health facility.” Dube said the man was escorted to the office of the matron, who explained the child couldn’t be released because of his head injury. “He was unhappy about this and stormed back to the emergency unit, where he verbally abused staff and forcefully took his child,” he said. “Security was advised to stop him from leaving the premises but he blocked the hospital entrance with a vehicle.” Dube said the man was then given a refusal of health form and he left with his son. The doctor took to social media to share her frustration. “It’s not the first time a man has verbally abused me on duty but I won’t keep quiet about it,” she tweeted. “I was told to shut up because I’m a woman! “He said he doesn’t speak to women.” Dube said currently, three security guards are allocated to the emergency unit but there are plans to increase them.
