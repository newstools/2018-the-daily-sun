ANGRY and emotional EFF Gauteng chairwoman Mandisa Mashego urged blacks to cripple Adam Catzavelos’ business. Catzavelos, a minor shareholder in St George’s Fine Foods, posted a 20-second video while on holiday. He recorded himself saying: “Blue skies, beautiful day, amazing sea and not one k*ff*r in sight. F*cking heaven on earth.” Mashego told Daily Sun whites are still openly insulting black people. “Behind their high walls in their homes we know they are raping their domestic workers. We will never be happy until we get our land back. We want to see this man suffer in jail,” she said. Mashego and other EFF members, accompanied by pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motshoeneng, have opened a criminal case against Catzavelos at Bramley cop shop. Mandisa said: “His business, The Smokehouse and Grill, must feel the pinch when African people boycott it. “We know the criminal justice system is useless but we’ll keep our eyes on this case.” The Catzavelos family said yesterday: “The video is abhorrent and we fully disassociate ourselves from the sentiments expressed. We reject racism in any form. “Adam Catzavelos has been dismissed with immediate effect from the family business and his minority shareholding will be unwound as soon as possible.” The statement said the business was temporarily closed for the protection of the staff. DA Youth leader Luyolo Mphithi said Catzavelos had committed a criminal offence. He said the DA had referred the matter to the South African Human Rights Commission. Pastor Mboro said the EFF had called him and he went with them to lay charges. “We must fight racism. A black man is not inferior to any white man. “We are equal before the eyes of God,” Mboro said.
