ACCORDING to the opposition, the Department of Education in Limpopo is failing to look into the causes of teenage pregnancy. During a visit to Molautsi Secondary School in Bloodriver outside Polokwane on Friday, provincial DA leader Jacques Smalle said no research had been done. It was recently reported that 27 girls at the school were pregnant. He said: “We’re concerned that schools are not safe havens for young mothers.” He said the party would ask the department to approach teenage mums and find out more about their experiences. “It is crucial that we don’t sideline them,” he said. “We need to support teenage mothers and ensure that they don’t become another statistic.” Smalle said the party welcomed the Management of Learner Pregnancy in Schools national draft policy. But parts of the draft policy needed to be revised to ensure the rights of pregnant pupils were upheld. “This will ensure girl pupils can focus on their studies and have the same access to the job opportunities offered to men,” he said. The second round of public comments for the policy were closed last week. Sonja Boshoff, a member of the portfolio committee on basic education, said the policy would help schools put an end to teenage pregnancies. “We are going to investigate so we can understand why there has been an increase in pregnancies at the school,” said Boshoff. “We also want to hear the pupils’ side of the story.” Deputy principal Joseph Phaleng urged parents to discipline their children.
