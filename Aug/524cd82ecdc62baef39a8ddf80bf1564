HE stands accused of killing his girlfriend and then
eating parts of her body. Four years after the murder, Joseph Oberhansley (37) has
now been found mentally fit to stand trial, according to reports. In September 2014, Oberhansley is accused of breaking
into his girlfriend, Tammy Jo Blanton’s, house in Jeffersonville, America. He
then allegedly raped her before stabbing her to death, and then sawing her head
and body open to eat her lungs, heart and brain. He has been awaiting trial ever since in a prison while
state psychiatrists test him to see if he’s sane enough to stand trial. He faces the death penalty if convicted. The next date for the hearing is 21 September. Oberhansley’s very strange behaviour has raised doubts
that he is sane enough to stand trial. According to the Courier Journal, during an interview with cops after Blanton’s
murder Oberhansley said odd things like “I'm like electrifying right now"
and "the gates are sealed." He has also tried to fire his lawyers because he said
they were “controlling his mind”. Oberhansley has a history of murderous behaviour.  In 1998 while he was high on tik he shot and killed
his 17-year-old girl and shot his mum in the back. He also fired a bullet into
his own head. He survived, although the bullet is still stuck inside his skull.
