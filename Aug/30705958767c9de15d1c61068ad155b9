A JUNKIE is facing the wrath of the law after his hungry son
ate the pile of tik that he left lying on a plate. According to New
York Post, Curtis Collman III (8) woke up early in their home in Indiana,
America on 21 June and told his dad Curtis Gilbert Collman II (41), that he was
hungry. His dad said there was nothing to eat in the house, but
little Curtis came across a plate with a pile of tik on it. Tik is brownish and could be mistaken for cereal. The boy gobbled the whole lot down. By 10am Collman II
noticed that Curtis was feeling sick and called a female friend to come and
check him out. But when the friend said they need to urgently call an
ambulance, Collman II freaked out. He allegedly ripped her cell phone away, pointed a gun at
her head and screamed, “I’m not going back to prison,” the Seymour Tribune reported. Threatening to shoot her, Collman II then picked Curtis
up and rushed to his parent’s house, according to WAVE TV. Soon after they arrived, Curtis started turning blue. In
a panic his granddad called for an ambulance, but Curtis died soon after
arriving at the Schneck Medical Center. This week, toxicology results were released. The Seymour Tribune reported that the child
had consumed a massive amount of tik – about 180 times the amount of a lethal
dosage. Collmann II faces a pile of charges, including neglect that
led to the death of a dependent and possession of meth. Curtis’ heartbroken gogo, Rita Cook, told ABC-WLOX: “We
all wake up in the morning thinking about him and we go to sleep at night
thinking about him. He was just a good little boy.”
