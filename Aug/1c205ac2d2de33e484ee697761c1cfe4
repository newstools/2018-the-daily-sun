TWO Bhekuzulu Primary School pupils who drowned in the Vryheid dumpsite dam were buried on Saturday. Ntokozo Khumalo (12) and Ayabonga Dlamini (9) drowned while collecting plastic for a school recycling competition last Saturday. The funeral was held at Bhekuzulu Hall in Vryheid, northern KZN. The boys were with a classmate, who’s receiving counselling, when they fell into the dam. The farewell was attended by pupils and teachers from Bhekuzulu Primary School. Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo was among officials who attended the funeral. Ayabonga’s madala Bheki Mntambo (53) described his grandson as a person who loved the Lord. “He was very bright and he learnt to read the Bible at a tender age,” he said. “He never went to bed without sharing a verse with us. I guess it was a sign that he would leave us soon.” Bheki said he was happy the young girl was receiving counselling. “I’m going to visit her family to see how she’s doing, as I didn’t see her at the funeral.” Ward councillor Phaphama Mbatha said: “We’ve been with both families since the tragedy. “We’re still going to be here for them to give them whatever support they need.” Zululand district deputy mayor Mavis Kunene said the dam will be fenced to prevent such incidents.
