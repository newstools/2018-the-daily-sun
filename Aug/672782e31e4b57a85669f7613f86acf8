THE lives of 27 children will change for the better after they undergo corrective surgery. The surgeries, which form part of the Smile Week initiative, started on Monday and will end today. Anelisa Faltein (5) from Motherwell is one of the kids operated on at Port Elizabeth Hospital. She suffers from Treacher Collins syndrome, a rare genetic condition that causes facial abnormalities. To correct this, surgeons performed a procedure called fat grafting on Monday. Fat was removed from Anelisa’s flanks and abdomen, processed, and injected into her face. Moira Gerszt, Smile Foundation’s director of operations, said: “We are grateful to be in a position to support children in need. The doctors had the opportunity to address different conditions.” Lungelwa Faltein (45), Anelisa’s mum, said: “I am happy with what the Smile Foundation did for my daughter. “She is so lucky that doctors made her life normal.”
