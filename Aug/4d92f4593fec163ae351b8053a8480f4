STAND up and be counted and never feel sorry for yourself! The is the call from Nonceba Siyobi (43) from Phola Park in Gugulethu, Cape Town. “I was born disabled,” said Nonceba, who owns a sewing business. She makes beautiful dresses, curtains and bedding sets. “I want disabled people to find their gift and not feel sorry for themselves.” Nonceba told Daily Sun she desperately needed an overlocking machine to compete with other people in the area. She said she’d also like to get a motorised wheelchair. “But I won’t say no to a normal wheelchair because this one is very old.” Nonceba rents a shack but has applied for an RDP house. “I hope that one day I’ll have my own house because I’m using my grant money to pay rent and it costs me R500 a month,” she said. Customer Mandy Gawuzana loves Nonceba’s work. “Even though people like using overlocking machines, I still prefer her because I believe one day she will get what she needs,” said Mandy.
