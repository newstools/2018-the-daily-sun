COPS need your help to bust fake cops who hijacked a truck that was transporting expensive whisky in the Vaal on Tuesday. Whisky worth about about R3 million was found in the hijacked truck at a suspect’s home. The fake cops haven’t been caught and their fake cop cars, a Golf GTI and a BMW, haven’t been recovered. They apparently stopped the truck and took its driver to one of their cars, supposedly to question him. Instead they drove away with him and dropped him off a few kilometres from the scene of the hijacking. Police received a tip-off, and a swift response by the Sedibeng tracing team led to the arrest of the three suspects. They were found in possession of the hijacked truck. On further investigation, police recovered many whisky boxes. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun the whisky boxes had already been loaded onto another truck. Police have now launched a massive manhunt for the rest of the suspects. And they’re looking for the rest of the stolen whisky, naturally. “The suspects will appear in the Joburg and Vereeniging magistrates courts on charges of hijacking and possession of a hijacked truck,” said Masondo.
