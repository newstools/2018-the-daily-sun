PUPILS from Khulakahle Preschool used to carry lunch boxes to school. This was a problem because most parents struggled to buy lunch for their children. But that is now becoming a thing of the past. The children from this preschool in Groutville, northern KZN, no longer have to carry lunch boxes. They will get freshly cooked meals after Shoprite installed a kitchen at the school. The supermarket chain will also provide food for the whole year through the Lunch Box Fund. It has also renovated the school building and playground and provided text books and other learning material. Khulakahle founder Buyi Mdinisi told Daily Sun she was happy that her preschool would benefit from the feeding scheme. She said she had considered closing the school because running it without support was difficult. “I had 21 children in my care and didn’t have sponsors,” she said. She said the children would often bring their own food. “But since they come from different homes, some came empty-handed,” she said. Mdinisi described the situation as hard. Centre for Childhood Development operations manager Rukea Shaik said the food retailer would continue helping early childhood development centres. Shoprite spokesman Lunga Schoeman said pupils now had access to a safe, stimulating learning environment.
