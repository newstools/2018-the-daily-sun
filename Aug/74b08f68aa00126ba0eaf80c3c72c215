Sikelela Dibela has made it big by starting small. He’s the founder of Sikis Koffee Kafe, which started operating in 2016. Sikelela transformed his garage into a stylish coffee shop in the heart of Khayelitsha, Cape Town. The 29-year-old is from Ilitha Park. “I know that God is helping me, and I will get to the top,” he told Daily Sun. His coffee shop has a seating area, a courtyard at the back, including a small internet cafe that has Wi-Fi. It has attracted international visitors and local media personalities. Sikelela said locals are charged less than tourists. “Coffee costs R30 for tourists and R25 for locals. “I do everything myself. I even bake muffins and sell them for only R2,50 as they go well with the coffee.” He thanked Vida e Caffe for the experience he got as a barista. He started there as a dishwasher. He said he was proud of what he had achieved. “I’m a grade 9 dropout, but I didn’t allow that to determine my life. I can do anything I want,” he said. “I didn’t complain when I had to wash dishes. I knew that everybody had to start somewhere, so that didn’t bother me, and now I own my own business.” Sikelela said he needed funding to buy another coffee machine. “I can’t cater at events because I have only one machine. It’s my dream to get a second coffee machine so I can cater at events and go whenever people need me.” Phiwe Qutyana (34), a barista at a different coffee shop, thanked Dibela for teaching him everything he knows. “I’m where I am today because of him,” he said. Mandla Sizani (34) was impressed with the coffee. “I make sure I get coffee at his cafe because it’s good and the price is affordable,” he said.
