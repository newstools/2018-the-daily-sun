THE case against three officials accused of fraud and corruption has yet again been postponed. Pumlani Mkolo, the suspended secretary of the Dr WB Rubusana region, Gauteng-based lawyer Zintle Nkuhlu and businesswoman Nosiphiwo Mati appeared briefly before the East London Magistrate Court on Wednesday. The officials and their eight co-accused allegedly intended to defraud the Buffalo City Metro of R10 million. They allegedly successfully transferred R5,9 million under the false pretence that it was meant for memorial events for former president Mandela in December 2013. The three applied to have their case heard separately from their co-accused andtheir application was granted. In their last appearance, they applied to have charges against them withdrawn. They said they felt strongly that the State couldn’t prove their involvement in the case. But their argument has not yet been heard in court. Nkuhlu allegedly received R350 000 of the funds, while Mati was reported to have received R100 000, allegedly at the insistence of Mkolo. Outside the court, a large group of Mkolo supporters hurled insults and threatened to attack journalists. They said they wouldn’t allow anyone to take a photo of their leader. The case was postponed to 19 October.
