Danielle De Bruyn, a former Westville Girls’ High teacher
who went on a racist rant, has issued an apology. De Bruyn resigned from her post on Monday after reports
emerged of her using the K-word during a lesson in class. De Bruyn, who was discussing Harper Lee’s “To Kill a
Mockingbird”, got into a heated debate with students. In a statement she released on Thursday, she claims that
her mistake "was to express a political view on land expropriation in the
classroom.” “I used the word during a discussion on Harper Lee’s
novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, and with reference to the N word,” she said. “I explained to the class that this was the equivalent in
the American social context of the racial slurs adopted historically in South
Africa.” De Bruyn said that the discussion took another turn when
she included land expropriation. She said that her expressions were in response to a
question posed by a learner. She also said that her resignation came after she felt
that she made a mistake. “I did not use the ‘k-word’ in reference to any
individual or group nor have I been accused of doing so,” she said. “I had a good rapport with the learners, and when I
apologised to them for imposing my own political views on them‚ many of them
seemed to be forgiving.”
