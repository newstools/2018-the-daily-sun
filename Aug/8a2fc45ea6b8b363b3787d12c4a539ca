WHEN the cops arrive at a place, most would think it’s to catch criminals. But cops from Moffat View cop shop are seen in a photograph climbing over fences to confront foreigners. They’re accused of forcing the foreigners to pay bribes even when they’ve done nothing wrong. A woman in the area told Daily Sun she was visiting a neighbour when cops jumped over a gate to gain access to a yard occupied by foreigners. She said the two guys that were found in the yard had only recently moved to Mzansi. One of them sells tomatoes. “The police here know where foreigners stay and will go there and demand money. “This time they found R2000 in the house and then more from the two men. “When they explained they had no more they were kept in a police van and told to phone their brothers and friends to bring more money,” she said. She claimed the cops drove around with them. “The foreign guys told the cops they would contact journalists and expose them,” said the woman. “The cops were not so happy to hear that and told them they would plant drugs on them.” She alleged cops often planted drugs on innocent people if they didn’t get what they wanted. Police spokesman Lungelo Dlamini said if the men who were arrested felt violated, they should open a case. “As soon as they are released from police custody, they can go to their nearest police station and lay a charge. The matter will then be dealt with by ipid.”
