YESTERDAY, Pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng was over the moon after claiming victory in court. The South Gauteng High Court in Joburg removed Absa’s case to have his assets repossessed from the court roll. This comes after the bank apparently took legal action against Mboro for non-payment last month. He said he didn’t owe Absa anything and had actually been defrauded of over R2 million. “I deliberately didn’t pay to protest fraud in my accounts which is continuing until today.” Mboro said he settled the payments before he was served with non-payment letters but the bank went to court. According to Mboro, there have been unauthorised transactions from his account since last year. “I’ve had several meetings with the bank to provide the police with the details of the beneficiaries of these debit orders, but they didn’t do anything,”he claimed. “There are still unauthorised transactions in my account and they have stolen more than R2 million,” he claimed. According to a letter seen by Daily Sun, the office of the senior public prosecutor in Palm Ridge, Ekurhuleni, subpoenaed the bank to release the details of the beneficiaries allegedly getting money from Mboro’s account unlawfully. Mboro said the debit orders were for things like personal loans, bonds and car instalment payments. He said the amounts ranged from R1000 to R100 000. “I skipped three payments after I moved my money to a separate account in an attempt to get the bank to sort out this matter,” he said. “After seeing it wasn’t getting resolved, I decided to transfer the money back and I settled all my debts and arrears in April. “I was surprised when the bank took legal action against me because I don’t owe them anything.” Absa said it was no position to comment on court proceedings at such short notice.
