BANYANA Banyana coach Desiree Ellis says she will use the Cosafa Women’s Championships to sharpen her attack for the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations set for 17 November to 1 December. Ellis named a strong 20-women squad on Monday, featuring a blend of local and internationally based players, for the competition in Port Elizabeth from 12-22 September. The coach says Banyana could be among the top ranked teams in Africa if they work on their composure in front of goal and beat the odds. Her priority is to ensure South Africa finish among the top three nations at the Women’s Afcon to qualify for the Fifa Women’s World Cup in France from 7 June to 7 July next year. It remains unclear, however, who will host the Women’s Afcon after Ghana were stripped of the rights to welcome the 24 teams. Football Kenya Federationpresident Nick Mwendwa, whose country was earmarked as favourites to replace Ghana, squashed any hopes yesterday of his country hosting the event. Ellis’ wish is to see Banyana’s scoring improve: “I have confidence in my strikers. Afcon is a big one and this tournament (Cosafa) will enable us to gauge how far we’ve come in terms of preparations. It’s non-negotiable, we have to qualify for the World Cup.” However, Ellis is aware her charges won’t have an easy passage to defend the trophy they won in Zimbabwe last year. They will face stronger opponents this time, with Cameroon having been invited along with Uganda as guests for the competition. Cameroon are ranked third on the continent and Uganda are 22nd. She added: “Cameroon are among the best on the continent but we know what to expect from them. We will be ready for all our opponents.” Veteran Banyana defender Janine van Wyk, who plies her trade for Houston Dash in USA, will captain the side, having missed last year’s tournament. However, she will only arrive a few days prior to the start of the competition, as their season ends around that time.
