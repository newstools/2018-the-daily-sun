Amid all of the hype surrounding Bonang Matheba’s incredible GQ cover, you might have missed a little hint that she might working on the next season of her reality show. After the reveal of GQ’s Power Issue cover featuring Bonang, the queen and her friends at Courvoisier threw a fabulous luncheon at the luxurious Four Seasons Westcliff Hotel in Johannesburg, as one does. In addition Bonang’s usual gang, Pinky Girl, Lorna Maseko and Ryan Hignett, the GQ editorial staff was also in attendance. Among the GQ staff was the editor-in-chief, Nkosiyati Khumalo who might have just robbed queen B of the opportunity to announce her next season of Being Bonang. Nkosiyati shared exclusive shots of the luncheon on his InstaStories for those who couldn’t crack an invite. And in one of the snaps, he captioned a picture of himself sandwiched between PinkyGirl and Bonang: “Season 3 guest star”. Which can only mean that Bonang was probably followed around by cameras shooting the next season of Being Bonang. Of course this would be a stretch for Bonang who wasn’t even interested in shooting a reality in the first place. Even after the first season, Queen B* swore never to do it again, but of course we all know that didn’t work out. So now the question is would she, and is she working on another season? After the resounding success of season two, we wouldn’t be surprised.
