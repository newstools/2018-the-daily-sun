CITY of Cape Town Safety and Security Councillor JP Smith has buried his head shame. This is after one of his traffic wardens decided to make extra cash with his friends by staging a fake vehicle checkpoint in Lansdowne Road, between Nyanga and Philippi. The off-duty warden and two of his friends allegedly pretended to be law enforcement officials on Women’s Day at about 9.30pm. Dressed in uniform, they used traffic department equipment including a radio and a warden’s appointment card. But a sharp motorist had the men bust. The motorist said he noticed the shoes they were wearing, and immediately knew the men were not real traffic officers. He then alerted the real cops, who pounced on the three. “I have over 10 years experience of driving and I know the kind of shoes traffic officers wear. These guys were wearing different shoes, even though the uniform was convincing,” he said. Smith said the motive was not clear but they were conducting their own investigation. “The City works hard to build good relationships with our communities. Acts like these simply serve to undermine our efforts and we will not tolerate it,” said Smith. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andrè Traut said the three suspects were arrested for impersonating traffic officers. “The three suspects were conducting an illegal roadblock with the possible intention of collecting bribe money from motorists. The three appeared in the Athlone Magistrates Court yesterday.” The three remain in custody as police investigations continue. The warden has already been served with a pre-suspension notice.
