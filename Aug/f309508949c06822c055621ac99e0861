SHE wants her daughter’s father to rot in jail. Her 19-year-old chid is pregnant and the father of the baby may be her biological father! The 38-year-old mum from Eshowe, northern KZN, was shocked when she discovered on Sunday that her daughter was three months pregnant. “This man is an inyanga and he has been living with my daughter since 2016,” said the mum. “He raped her repeatedly for more than two years after they started living together in his home in Illovo.” She said her daughter started living with her father in 2016 after she failed grade 10 and didn’t want to repeat the grade in the same school. She said after raping her daughter, the man would send her to her boyfriend, possibly to frame him should it emerge that she had started having sex or fell pregnant. “At the moment we’re waiting for DNA results to establish who the real father is,” she said. She said she still wanted the inyanga to go to jail, no matter what the DNA test result were. She learnt about the ordeal when on Sunday her daughter opened up about it to her father’s neighbour, who advised her to open a case. The man was arrested later in the day and made his first appearance in the Nsimbini Magistrates Court on Tuesday. KZN cops spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane told Daily Sun: “We can confirm that a 42-year-old man was arrested in connection with raping a 19-year-old woman.
