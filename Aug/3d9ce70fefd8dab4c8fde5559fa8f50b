South African-born, superstar comedian Trevor Noah will officially host the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 in Johannesburg. He will hold down the hosting duties together with Naomi Campbell, Sir Bob Geldof, Gayle King, Tyler Perry, Forest Whitaker and our very own Bonang Matheba. The Daily Show host has scarcely been in SA since scoring the big gig which saw him become a global celebrity. And he says he is overjoyed to be booked for the festival. “It is an honour to be a part of the Global Citizen Festival event celebrating the life and legacy of Nelson Mandela. I am where I am today living as a free South African because of much of what he did and so I'm beyond excited to be teaming up with so many others to pay tribute to the man in his home country,” he said in a statement. The aim of the festival is to bring together artists, world leaders, private sector leaders and ordinary individuals to make commitments on the issues surrounding extreme poverty. ICYMI: BEYONCE AND JAY Z COMING TO SA! The free-ticketed event will take place on Sunday, 2 December 2018 at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg.
