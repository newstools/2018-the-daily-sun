WHO needs to wait in line for a job when one can just lock the gates and demand work! This is what angry, jobless uMkhonto weSizwe military veterans did in Richmond, in the KZN Midlands, recently. They vowed to keep the municipal office gates locked until they were hired. They took over the premises yesterday and denied workers entry. Their Richmond secretary Sibonelo Shange told the People’s Paper: “We’ll only leave when management gives us what we want. “We’re residents and deserve equal opportunities like everyone else,” said Shange. “We want the municipality to give us jobs and to have a military veterans policy that addresses our welfare. Shange said they were left with no option but to bring everything to a standstill. “We’ve been in meetings with management, but won’t listen to us. This is the only language they understand. “They must give us what we want so that they can continue providing the residents of Richmond with services.” They handed over their memorandum to deputy mayor Khonziwe Mkhize. Mkhize told Daily Sun: “We will go through the grievances and come back with answers within the given time.” Spokesman Sibonelo Bhengu said the veterans gave the municipality seven days to respond. “They will also meet with management when the situation has calmed down,” he said.
