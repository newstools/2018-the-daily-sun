ONE would have thought that boardroom troubles surrounding cash strapped Bloemfontein Celtic would have a negative impact on players on the pitch, but that hasn’t been the case with Steve Komphela’s lads. It has been reported that Phunya Sele-Sele players are yet to receive their salaries for July with the club said to be on the verge of exchanging ownership. However, Celtic are among the clubs enjoying a 100% start to the new Absa Premiership campaign. The others being Bidvest Wits who thrashed Kaizer Chiefs 3-1 on Tuesday. Siwelele beat Chippa United 2-0 in their opening league game at the weekend and they again beat Golden Arrows by the same margin on Wednesday, on Sunday they continued with their impressive start when they defeated Orlando Pirates 1-0. Komphela however, said off the pitch problems brought unity in his team. He said in a strange way it has been a blessing in disguise. Said Komphela: “In everything that is currently happening at the club our focus has been positive. Indirectly what is currently happening in our boardroom has a good impact on the pitch. If what you hear or seen register in your mind in a negative way then your attitude will change to be negative. "We have accepted it and put it aside to focus on the job at hand. We had to look at the positives and that has brought us together.” Komphela said his players will use the break to recover as they are not involved in the MTN8 Cup. Although, Celtic have yet to concede this season, Komphela warned his players not to get carried away. “We can’t get ahead of ourselves. The only thing we need to do is to accept what we have accomplished at moment and look forward. The break will help the boys to get a little bit of rest. We will also get an opportunity to have a look at other players that we haven’t used in this two matches,” added Komphela.
