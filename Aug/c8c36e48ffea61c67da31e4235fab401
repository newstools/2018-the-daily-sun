WHEN the sewage pipe started leaking in December, Thembi Mazibuko reported the problem. Thembi said she spoke to a friendly municipal official on the phone and was given a reference number. But today, 10 reference numbers later, the leak still hasn’t been fixed! Thembi (58) from Othandweni in Thokoza, Ekurhuleni, said she was gatvol with the water and sanitation department. She told Daily Sun the sewage had affected her granddaughter’s health. “She has developed a nagging cough and the doctor said the water with dangerous bacteria might be the cause,” said Thembi. She said she also has symptoms and had tried to get a plumber. “He said he couldn’t help me because the issue wasn’t with the house drains but with the main sewage pipe, which is the municipality’s responsibility.” But according to Thembi, the municipality has been dragging its feet. “When we call they tell us they’re looking into it,” she said. The only time they came, she said, was in April. “They put up a safety fence after the sewage water caused my wall to collapse,” she said. Municipal spokesman Zweli Dlamini said: “Our technicians have been to the affected area. “We discovered that the issue was bigger than just a blocked main and woud need serious intervention.” Dlamini said they were working on a plan. “In the meantime, we’ll try to find a solution that will stop the water from flowing into people’s yards.”
