Being a celebrity has to be one of the most exhausting things in the world. While celebs live luxurious lives and are the envy of many, some parts of their lives are not really what many would wish for. Various celebs have had their accounts hacked, their loved ones and fans scammed and their faces used on shady Ads. The victim this time is superstar producer and DJ, DJ Prince Kaybee. Prince Kaybee is worried about an imposter who is communicating with people under his name. The Club Controller hit-maker shared a WhatsApp conversation on social media between the imposter and someone else. In the conversation, the person pretending to be Prince Kaybee is organising a meeting with the unsuspecting victim. The imposter tells the other person to “organise chicks, money is not a problem.” The real Prince Kaybe is fearing the worst. “What worries me more about this is that this person can do even worse things like human trafficking,” he captioned a picture of the conversation on Instagram. “You’d think you going to meet Prince Kaybee and find out it’s the end of your life. “Look out for such scams,” he warned fans. ?My manager just sent me this..., what worries me more about this is that this person can do even worse things like human trafficking????‍??. You’d think you going to meet Prince Kaybee and find out its the end of your life??. Look out for such scams? ?Guess this comes with being famous... #Banomoya ?
