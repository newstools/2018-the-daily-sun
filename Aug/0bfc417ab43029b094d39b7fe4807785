WHEN Kgosi Tshila (37) left home in 2016 for Joburg, his uncle promised his mum he’d take good care of him. But soon his uncle found a girlfriend and kicked his family member out on the street. With nowhere else to turn, Kgosi’s only solution was to live among the graves. Kgosi, who lives at Brixton Cemetery, told Daily Sun: “I left Mahikeng in 2016 because my uncle promised my mum he would take care of me and find me a job. “Things were going well till he got a girlfriend.” He said his uncle started complaining, saying he ate too much and didn’t even work. “He even complained about me coming home late, as young as I am,” Kgosi said. “We had a really good relationship but things turned sour. “He would suddenly change the channel while I was watching TV and told me it was his home and he could do as he pleased.” Last January, his uncle threw him out. “I was sad that my uncle disowned his blood relative because of a woman he’d just met. “I begged him to give me a week but he showed me no mercy and just kicked me out.” Kgosi took the little luggage he had and decided to go house to house to look for a job. Luckily, someone gave him a job as a gardener. “The home owner offered to pay me R1 700 a month. “It was perfect but I didn’t want to burden him by asking him for a place to sleep, so I decided to sleep at the cemetery.” Kgosi told Daily Sun sleeping in the graveyard wasn’t easy but he would do anything to keep his mum happy. “She doesn’t know her son lives in the cemetery. “Sleeping here is scary. “I always have nightmares and often see ghosts but have nowhere else to go. “If I stop, my mother will suffer even more and I don’t want that. “I will keep trying till I get a better job,” Kgosi said.
