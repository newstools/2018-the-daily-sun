KAMVA Daba was videotaped as she was being stripped naked and humiliated in public. She had hoped justice would be on her side. The 21-year-old, a victim of indecent assault, said the law has failed her. The three women who allegedly stripped her naked were granted bail in the Mdantsane Magistrates Court in East London yesterday. The accused, Mihlali Mkwayi (29), Noluthando Madotyeni (23) and Athule Khakha (24), appeared in court. The incident made headlines two weeks ago after the video of a naked Kamva was circulated on social media. She was accused of sleeping with one of the women’s boyfriend, something she has denied. Following the incident, Mdantsane residents in NU3 chased the suspects’ families from the area. During their court appearance yesterday, the magistrate said the three women didn’t pose a flight risk and granted them R1 000 bail each. They were instructed to move for their safety. They were told to be available whenever the court needed them and not interfere with the complainant. The matter was postponed to 24 August. “I really don’t understand why the magistrate said the three don’t pose a flight risk,” said Kamva. “Police looked for them for a week after they ran away. Who knows if they’re going to catch them again? “They humiliated me for no reason, and now they’re roaming the streets as if nothing had happened.” Mdantsane residents and local women’s organisations expressed disappointment in the outcome.
