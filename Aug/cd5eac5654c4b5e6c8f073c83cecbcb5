TV and radio personality, Anele Mdoda is doing her bit to give back to the less fortunate. She was recently challenged to take part in Nickelodeon’s Toy Sprint with Toys “R” Us and sprint to collect as many toys as possible for a charity of her choice. The 947 Breakfast Club presenter raced through Mall of Africa’s Toys “R” Us store and managed to grab a trolley full of toys. Her toys will be donated to her favourite charity, Bethany Children’s Home – Place of Safety, based in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. “I have supported Bethany Children’s Home for many years and love them because they provide a home for orphans from birth to six years of age. My plan was to collect creative and lateral thinking games and board games to encourage them to think while having fun,” said Anele Mdoda who is from the Mthatha. Anele was joined by twelve lucky kids from around South Africa including Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban to fill their trolleys with as many toys as possible within a minute to the maximum value of R15 000 from a Toys “R” Us stores at Mall of Africa, Canal Walk and Gateway Theatre of Shopping.
