THE organisers of the #TotalShutDown march say they have
been informed of charges against them and have been told to hand themselves
over to the police. On 1 August the #TotalShutDown march Gauteng conveners saw
thousands of women and gender non-conforming (GNC) people marched across the
country. According to the conveners they are currently seeking legal
advice, after they were instructed to hand themselves over to the cops. “Although we feel this is somewhat an attack on the movement,
we shall follow procedures and abide by the law accordingly,” they said. In a statement, the movement appealed for support from all
partners and those in solidarity with their movement and called for government
to treat GBV as a crisis during this time. They also said they would like to remind the state that the
march was targeted at gender-based violence, femicide, and the harassment of
women.
