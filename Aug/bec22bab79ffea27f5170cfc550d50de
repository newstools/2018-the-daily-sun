WHEN he met with a man who promised him quick wealth, he took a leap of faith and followed him – but before he knew it, his R30 000 was gone. The victim (58) from KwaDukuza told Daily Sun he met the man in Verulam, north of Durban on 15 August. The man apparently asked him to accompany him to collect a gold stone on the Durban beachfront on 15 August. “When we got there he made a call to another man who promised to bring the stone to us. Within a matter of minutes he arrived and showed us the stone. “He said we needed to give him R95 000 as the stone was worth R950 000,” said the victim. He said the man he met in Verulam begged him to get half of the required money. “I believed him and went to a local stokvel and managed to get a loan of R15 000. I added it to my R15 000 savings.” He said the following day he phoned the man and told him he had managed to raise R30 000. “He said it was fine and we headed for the beachfront again. When we got there, he phoned the other man who responded by saying he should bring the money to him alone, because people had found out about the stone and he feared they would take it,” said the victim. “That was the last time I saw him and his phone now goes straight to voicemail when I call him. “I want this man and his partners arrested for robbing me of so much money,” said the victim. He said he tried opening a case at KwaDukuza cop shop but cops told him he might also be arrested for involving himself in scam. But KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane advised the victim to go back to the cop shop and ask to see the station commander. “He must tell the commander what happened to him and that he wants to open a criminal case against the con artists,” said Zwane. He advised the public to be careful of promises of wealth that seem too good to be true.
