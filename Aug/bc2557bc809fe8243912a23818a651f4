FOR 19 years the family struggled to reunite their parents in death. Albert Mahlangu, who died in 1999, was buried in the wrong place and not on top of his late wife, who had died in 1990. But then it took less than a week for SunPower to move heaven and earth – and now Albert has finally been reunited with his beloved Gertrude! Daily Sun published the story on 15 August with the headline, “Grave headache for families!” On Monday Tshwane Municipality exhumed Albert’s body. Godfrey Nkosi (53) of C4 in Mamelodi West said the family was at peace now that his father’s body had been reburied at B3 Cemetery in Mamelodi West. “We are happy. This is what we have been waiting for, all these years: to place our dad in the right grave.” Godfrey said without Daily Sun Albert would still be buried in the wrong grave. However, he said he was hurt by the fact that the municipality still had not apologised for making the mistake that almost tore his family apart. Daughter Janette Mkhwanazi (54) said the grave error filled her with worry. She said now that the matter had been resolved, they would not have to worry about their grandfather’s angry spirit. “Both spirits are in the same grave, which means good things are on the way for the family,” she said. Granddaughter Ingrid Moloto (36) said she was relieved. “We did not have money to exhume the body, but after the reburial we hope that good luck will follow us,” she said.
