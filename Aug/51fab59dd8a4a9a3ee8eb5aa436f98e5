IT’S not clear what the motive was for the murder of a kasi physical trainer. Talent Ngcobo (29), from KwaMashu, north of Durban was shot and killed on Saturday. The incident happened when an unknown man entered the gym and opened fire, killing Talent in the process. The suspect allegedly arrived while Talent was training people in the gym in B section and asked to speak to him privately. He apparently said he wanted to join the gym. While the two men were talking, the suspect allegedly pulled a gun and fired three shots at Talent before fleeing the scene. Talent was rushed to hospital but died on arrival. Some kasi people said it was the act of an angry man who lost his woman to Talent, but others said it was just a normal crime. A resident told Daily Sun Talent had been warned about poking women who are members of the gym. “Maybe he was shot by an angry man. “Talent even had a baby with a member of the gym,” said the resident. Another resident said Talent’s death could be related to the fact that physical trainers in the area were fighting over clients. “Another physical trainer was shot last month. “They are allegedly accusing each other of stealing clients,” said the resident. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said KwaMashu police were investigating a case of murder. “The suspect and the motive are unknown at this stage,” said Gwala. Talent’s father, Bhekumuzi Ngcobo (53), denied rumours that his son was poking women at the gym. He said Talent had told him that trainers were accusing each other of stealing clients.
