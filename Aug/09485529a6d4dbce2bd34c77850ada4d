TRAFFIC cops are still reeling in shock following the horrific death of one of their colleagues on Sunday. Thokozani Cele (41) was killed instantly when a truck driver failed to stop and knocked him over. Cele was conducting an arrest near Estcourt, KZN. Police and traffic cops are now hunting for the driver, who didn’t stop at the accident scene but sped off. KZN MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda described Cele’s death as a blow to the traffic police family. He said it was a setback to the department’s commitment to saving lives on the road. Kaunda called on cops to work around the clock to find and arrest the truck driver. “This is a great loss to the department. The manner in which Cele died was unfortunate and clearly indicates that the suspect was irresponsible. “Anyone who may have witnessed the incident must assist the cops with information that will lead to the suspect’s arrest.” Kaunda sent his deepest condolences to Cele’s family. He called on traffic cops to exercise extreme caution when executing their duties. “A case of hit and run was opened and cops are following all possible leads to bring the suspect to book.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Colenso cops were investigating a case of culpable homicide.
