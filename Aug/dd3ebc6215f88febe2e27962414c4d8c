THE South African Human Rights Commission partnered with Tshwane University of Technology to hold a discussion on blesser culture at institutions of higher learning. Author and motivational speaker Jackie Phamotse and #TotalShutDown National steering committee member Mandisa Khanyile were part of the panel. Phillip Molekoa, an advocacy officer at the commission, said the main object of the discussion was to raise awareness about issues related to gender-based violence. “The month of August provides platforms to celebrate the great strides achieved to improve the status of women,” he said. Phamotse said the best way for students to avoid blessers was to stay true to themselves. “It’s okay to be hungry and poor. If women stay true to who they are, there won’t be a demand for blessers,” she said. “It’s not a sustainable lifestyle. “If you believe your soul is worth a weave and an Iphone, then you are lost.” Phamotse advised the students against allowing social media to pressurise them. “If you follow people who encourage you to empower yourself, you won’t suffer unnecessary depression,” she said. Khanyile said the focus was always on women but never on men. “Women are the ones who always have to guard themselves, be pillars of strength and take responsibility for their actions. “We never put the same burden on men,” she said. Students learnt a lot from the panel. Oratilwe Mokwena (24) said: “The discussion completely changed my mindset, and I believe I am going to be a better person after this. “I used to be so desperate to find a blesser that I ended up losing my purpose in life.”
