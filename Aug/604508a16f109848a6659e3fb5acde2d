TWO zama zamas aged 24 and 29 died on Monday and a 21-year-old was left seriously injured after a tunnel collapsed. The incident in Kleinsee, Northern Cape, happened not far from Bontekoe mine, where 10 people died after a tunnel collapsed six years ago. According to residents, at least 50 cars are parked in the area at any given time, with between 80 and 100 people digging. The residents told the SunTeam that zama zamas had been told the shafts in the area were unsafe but wouldn’t listen. DA Northern Cape leader Andrew Louw said they were sad to learn of the tragedy. Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kok said inquest dockets were opened. “Two men were retrieved from the hole and transported to Komaggas Clinic, where they were reported dead on arrival. The third person is currently at Port Nolloth Hospital,” he said. Anyone with information about the incident should call detective Constable John Vorster on 079 529 3932. Louw said the DA would send a letter to Northern Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General Risimati Shivuri calling for urgent intervention.
