COLLEN Nyalundu feels that the justice system has failed him. The 29-year-old from extension 1 in Soshanguve, north of Tshwane claims a group of cops offered no explanation after they shot and assaulted him. Although the alleged attack happened in December, Collen still has many unanswered questions. He said four cops from Soshanguve cop shop stormed into his house and attacked him. While he was trying to fight them, he heard a loud bang and felt a sharp pain in his right leg. “I was taken to hospital and spent five days there. I was charged with resisting arrest, but when I was supposed to appear in court I was told the charges were dropped,” said Collen. He said he laid charges against the four cops. “Nothing has been done,” he said. Moses Dlamini, national spokesman for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, said: “Collen was informed that we were trying to locate the ballistic report. The outstanding statements were obtained. The docket will be referred to the public prosecutor.”
