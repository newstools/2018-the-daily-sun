THE family of a woman who went missing from hospital wants answers. Pinky Masuvhelele (31), who worked for an insurance company, went missing from Tshilidzini Hospital, Thohoyandou, on 30 July. This happened four days after she was admitted. Her husband Jeffrey Ramuhashi said on the night she disappeared, he received a call asking whether Pinky had gone home. “I immediately rushed to the hospital, where they told me nurses found she had gone missing at about 8pm,” he said. “We phoned her mum Peggy Maravha, and when she arrived we started searching with the help of security guards. “It’s been about a week now and we’ve had sleepless nights trying to figure out what could’ve happened.” Jeffrey said his wife had been admitted to the private ward, so he was surprised there were no survellience cameras. “We’re disappointed as a family. We want to know what happened to our beloved Pinky. She couldn’t have disappeared into thin air.” Health spokesman Neil Shikwambana said the department was investigating circumstances leading to her disappearance and would take action if it was found staff had been negligent. Police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a missing persons docket was opened. Pinky is of average height and weight and light in complexion. She was wearing pink pyjama trousers, a white top and Adidas sandals. Anyone with info can contact Warrant Officer Ndowiseni Radzilani on 082 222 9023 or 015 960 1000.
