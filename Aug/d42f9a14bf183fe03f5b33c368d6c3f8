LAST Friday, loyal cops were recognised at the Provincial Tracker Awards ceremony, held at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Port Elizabeth. The guests included Eastern Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga and the tracking company’s operations director, Ron Knott-Craig. Ntshinga saluted every woman. She said: “This event takes place at a very important time as we begin to celebrate Women’s Month. “We’re here to pay tribute to those remarkable sons and daughters of our province, whose achievements and lifelong striving for excellence has brought honour to all of us.” Knott-Craig thanked the cops for their dedication and hard work. He said: “Our company sees it as a huge privilege to work side by side with police members. “We pay tribute to those members who have served their community and country with dedication and distinction. “We’re acknowledging them and paying tribute to our beloved Madiba, from whom we all have learnt so much. “He taught us to have hope and to serve, to persevere and create change and inspiration.” The winners included Warrant Officer Moegmat Calvert from Port Elizabeth, who won in the Dog Unit category, and Warrant Officer Severiano. Blundin, from the flying squad, and Sergeant Shaun Dicks from the K9 unit were named lifetime achievers. The winners will go through to the national awards, which will be held in October.
