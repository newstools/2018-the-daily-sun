DEATH has once again visited the notorious KwaMashu Hostel. Just as residents thought they could enjoy some peace and quiet, gunshots rang out at the hostel in KwaMashu, eThekwini, yesterday morning. A 26-year-old taxi driver was shot and killed while transporting passengers. A yellow taxi had apparently just picked up passengers going to Gateway Mall when two unknown suspects opened fire on Musa Road, killing the driver and injuring a passenger. A driver who witnessed the shooting said he saw the taxi turning at Musa Road when two men walked up to the vehicle and shot the driver. “The minute I heard gunshots, I ducked for cover. They shot the driver twice and escaped on foot. I didn’t see which direction they went as I had ducked to avoid getting shot. The driver then lost control of the taxi and it landed up on to a pathway,” he said. He said he and other drivers at the taxi rank went to investigate and found the victim was dead. “The taxi was full of passengers. One passenger was injured as they had pushed each other during the shooting. They told us the men asked the driver why he was such a bad driver before shooting him,” said the witness. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “A driver was fatally shot and a passenger was taken to hospital. “Charges of murder and attempted murder are being investigated by the KwaMashu police. No arrests have been made at this stage.”
