WHEN he was just 12 days old, his mum abandoned him at a hospital. Maybe she couldn’t face the fact that her son had been born with arthrogryposis, a rare muscle disorder. Doctors gave Thembinkosi Matshimane just two years to live, and everyone was amazed when he somehow reached puberty. He was buried on Saturday, aged 13. Friends, family and residents gathered at Charlene’s Place of Safety in Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane, to bid farewell to Thembinkosi. Speaker after speaker described him as an intelligent boy with a beautiful smile. They spoke about his love of soccer and cricket. Councillor Floyd Thema said: “He was very special. You couldn’t tell when he was sad because he always had a smile on his face.”
