A GRADUATION photo of a Texan student hanging out with
her favourite alligator has gone viral. According to The Guardian, Makenzie Noland graduated from
Texas A&M University with a major in wildlife ecology. She’s apparently amazed by what’s happened to the pic she
posted on Facebook and Instagram. She said: “I am overwhelmed with how viral my post has
gotten,” , “and to see everyone from my hometown pushing me to move forward and
supporting me is truly incredible”. Makenzie has been working at a gator centre. “I get in the water with that animal every day,” she said.
“Every single time I get in the water with him, I realise how huge he is. He’s
a real-life dinosaur.” She added that Big Tex liked to have his nose tickled
before being fed.
