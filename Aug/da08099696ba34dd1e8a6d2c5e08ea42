SONWABO Primary School principal Bongani Dlwathu called on the public to stop causing unnecessary panic among parents by spreading lies on social media. Dlwathu was referring to a WhatsApp voice message that claimed two kids from the school in Gugulethu, Cape Town, were kidnapped on Wednesday. “These are lies. No such thing happened at my school. The person who recorded the message should have called the school instead of spreading lies,” said Dlwathu. Nonyameko Joba, the school’s safety and security secretary, said: “We saw the department’s statement about the alleged incidents in Zonnebloem, so we are running an awareness programme with the kids.” On Wednesday, Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schafer said she received reports about two abductions that allegedly took place in Zonnebloem over the past two weeks. Pupils were reportedly being targeted while travelling to and from school. She urged parents to inform their children of the dangers of accepting food or drinks from strangers. “We asked parents to accompany their children to and from school as well as ensuring they had safe transport on Thursday,” said Dlwathu. He said after the fake message started circulating on Whatsapp, members of the local neighbourhood watch went to the school on Thursday morning to find out if the rumours were true. “We are using this opportunity to encourage parents to look after their children.” Western Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula said: “We looked at our records and haven’t found anything about the alleged Zonnebloem abductions. “However, we have increased visibility in the area. We are calling on anyone with information about the abduction of pupils to come forward so we can address the matter.”
