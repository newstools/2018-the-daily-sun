VETERAN Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Willard Katsande is unfazed by their current winless streak in the Absa Premiership. Amakhosi have played four league matches and have yet to collect maximum points. They drew three and lost one, with their latest draw coming against another winless side, Maritzburg United, last Friday. Katsande, who has been in this situation with Chiefs before, says this too shall pass. Said Katsande: “We’ve been playing some fantastic football lately, but we have failed to complement it with wins. This is just a minor slump, we’ve been here before and I believe there isn’t much that we need to do to fix in our game. “We’ve conceded soft goals and are happy to have had our first clean sheet against Maritzburg. Now our focus is to ensure we work on our execution in front of goal. Coach Giovanni Solinas has also said it, we need to be clinical in front of goal.” Chiefs had underperformed in the last three seasons under Steve Komphela and this season their fans expect change. Amakhosi are trophyless and fans are running out of patience. The Zimbabwean understands their frustration, however, and said they have enough firepower to challenge for silverware. “All is not lost. We know there is pressure but we also know what is expected of us. We need to dust ourselves off and do what is necessary. “The positives that we are taking from these matches is that we are managing to create chances, our only problem is that we haven’t utilised them. It would have been a mountain to climb if we were not creating those chances. All we need to do now is to focus on our next match and try to win it,” added Katsande. Amakhosi will now turn their focus to the MTN8 Cup where they will meet rejuvenated SuperSport United in the first leg semifinal at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday.
