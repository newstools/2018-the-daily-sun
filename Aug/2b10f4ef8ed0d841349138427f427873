GAUTENG wants to resolve the headache of initiation schools in the province. This follows the decision by the CRL Rights Commission last year to ban initiation schools in the province until the end of 2018. The MEC for Gauteng Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Uhuru Moiloa said an initiation monitoring task team headed by Prince George Mahlangu dealt with 66 cases carried over from the last the winter initiation season. Moiloa was speaking during a press briefing in Joburg yesterday. He said there were many reasons for the drug abuse at the moment, but among other things, many young people were roaming the streets and taking drugs because the initiation of young boys was not focused on teaching them to fit into modern society. “These kids become criminals and some become rapists. Initiation schools should seek to curb this kind of social misconduct,” he said. He said initiation schools in the province should be able to expand their focus. “Gauteng is the economic hub of the country. We should train these boys to be prepared to deal with the challenges of life in an economic hub,” said Moiloa. Meanwhile, two bogus initiation hot spots in Joburg and in Sedibeng Municipality were managed by the task team. With 66 cases reported, 44 were dealt with successfully, leaving 16 illegal schools closed down.
