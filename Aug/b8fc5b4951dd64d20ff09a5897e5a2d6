The judicial commission of inquiry into state capture confirmed on Tuesday that attorney Comfort Ngidi had withdrawn his request to be considered for a role in the commissionâ€™s legal or investigative team. "The reasons advanced by Mr Ngidi for the withdrawal of his request include that when he made his request, the Commission was meant to complete its work within six months but now it has said that it needs 24 months and he would not be available for such a long time," the commission said in a statement. Ngidi is a Zuma loyalist who led a group of "concerned" KwaZulu-Natal lawyers on a campaign to discredit former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's Nkandla report. The inquiry, chaired by Justice Raymond Zondo, is an outcome of the State of Capture report written by Madonsela.
