A business executive at the auditor general’s office in North West, Success Marota, presented a bad picture of the state of local government in Mahikeng on Friday. Findings showed poor management of the municipalities in the province due to a lack of skills. Billions go to consultants while people who are hired for the job do nothing. Marota said the province has not one municipality with a clean audit. “Twenty out of 22 municipalities have undesirable results. There’s no proper record keeping. They all rely on consultants which cost R96,2 million. There are accountability failures, causing irregular expenditure. “These entities have regressed in their performance,” said Marota. One of the worst municipalities is Madibeng, in Brits. “It cannot account for R2,4 billion. The others with problems are Rustenburg and Ngaka Modiri Molema municipalities. “These municipalities are not compliant with the rules and regulations required to manage these important institutions. “They don’t achieve the milestones they set in projects. “There’s a R1,6 billion backlog on projects. The causes are the slow response from politicians and the lack of oversight by the councils, especially mayors.” He said there was nothing they could do until the law was passed for the auditor general to take action. “All I can say is that there are inadequate skills. Consultants must help these internal employees to develop and meet the mandate,” said Marota. “Politicians must use consequence management against whoever is responsible for poor performance.”
