EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu was arrested on Friday morning after being bust speeding on the N1. Shivambu was driving his Range Rover when he was caught driving at 182km/h in a 120km/h zone near Winburg, Free State. He was arrested by traffic cops and taken to the police station but was later released on bail. A cop said Shivambu made no attempt to flee the scene when he was stopped. “He was very co-operative and he was immediately arrested.” Free State police department spokeswoman Hillary Mophethe confirmed the incident and Shivambu’s arrest. “He was caught driving at 182km/h in a 120km/h zone on the N1. He was heading to the Free State when he was arrested at about 10.45am,” she said. “He was charged with exceeding the speed limit and released on bail of R4 000. He will appear in court on Friday.” The SunTeam tried to reach Shivambu for comment but couldn’t get hold of him as his cellphone was off.
