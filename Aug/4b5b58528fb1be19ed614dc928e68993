ALL she wanted to do was to certify her documents but instead, she got a hot klap! Jabu Khoza (42) from Troyeville in Joburg was then arrested by cops at Jeppe Police Station in Joburg. When her family asked the police what led to the arrest, they were allegedly told to stop trying to be detectives. Slindile Ngwenya (20) told Daily Sun she was with Jabu when she was beaten by the police and arrested. She took a short video with her phone, which shows Jabu being manhandled by two policemen. Slindile said the incident started when a cop refused to certify their documents. “She only certified a few and then told us she was tired. She stood up and went away. Jabu asked the other officers for help, but they just sat there,” claimed Slindile. She claimed Jabu then threatened to call the station commander. “She talked on the phone for a moment and came back. She took a picture with her phone and threatened to post it on social media to expose the cop.” Slindile claimed two cops rushed to Jabu and tried to take her phone. “The policewoman came back and hit her,” she claimed. Slindile claimed when Jabu tried to retaliate, two cops stopped her. “Jabu held on to the bench and asked what she was being arrested for. They then dragged her and later took her phone,” she claimed. Jeppe Police Station spokesman Richard Munyai said Jabu was arrested because an assault case was opened against her. “I cannot say what happened, but the policewoman claims she was assaulted. I cannot confirm anything at this stage. Everything will be discovered when Jabu appears in court,” he said.
