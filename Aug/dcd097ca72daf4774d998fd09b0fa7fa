Making slow romantic songs (Ballads) has been the hallmark of Nathi’s career so far, but he has decided to showcase his versatility on the new album by generally upping the tempo. “We’re still writing about love but the difference with this album is that we’re making people dance,” he said. The lead single from the album, Qeqe, is one of the fan favorites and has been well received. “Qeqe is a happy song,” he said, “I knew when I made that song that my fans would really like it. “It talks about something that everyone experiences, which is love, but it also makes people get up and dance,” he added. While Nathi’s previous two offerings Buyelekhaya and Umbulelo Wabantu will be a tough acts to follow, he is adamant that this latest album will do better than both. “When I release a new album, I expect it to be better than my previous work,” he said. “Our fans appreciate growth and I would not disrespect them by giving them the same thing time and time again,” he added.
