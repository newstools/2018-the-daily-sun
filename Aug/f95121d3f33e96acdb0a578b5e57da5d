THE Liquor Board has expressed shock at the high number of underage children drinking alcohol. Although alcohol abuse is a national problem, Khumoetsile Taona, director of liquor regulation, said a large number of under-age kids were found in liquor outlets during a midnight raid at Christiana and Bloemhof, North West at the weekend. This led to fines of about R40 000 being issued to liquor outlets. The Department of Economy and Enterprise Development conducted a joint operation with police. At least 26 outlets were raided and, according to cops, 25 were found to be in contravention of the Liquor Act. Offences ranged from operating multiple businesses with just one licence, operating with a licence belonging to a dead person without proper transfer, as well as selling takeaway booze at a drinking place. Taona said: “It was the first time in all the operations we have conducted that we witnessed such a large number of underage children at taverns, pubs and bottle stores. This is disturbing and unacceptable. It shows that some of the liquor traders are contravening the conditions of their licences. “Young people have developed a social culture that sets drinking booze as a rite of passage.”
