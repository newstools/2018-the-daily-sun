A 39-YEAR-OLD woman lost count of the men who were involved in her brutal gang rape. All she remembers is going to a tavern to celebrate her favourite soccer team’s victory. When she woke up in a hospital, she was weak and tired. Residents of section 16 in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, said they recall hearing a woman screaming for help, but attributed the noise to a drunk person. However, the morning of 26 July will remain in their memory forever. The woman, from section C4 in Mamelodi West, was found unconscious and naked. On Tuesday the DA in Tshwane visited the woman and her family. The woman’s cousin said the family had struggled to open a case. He said although most people in section 16 knew about the incident, the police insisted the woman open a case when she regained consciousness. “A case was eventually opened, but we are not happy because four of the suspects are still on the streets,” he said. DA Tshwane chairman Abel Tau said the party would support the woman. “I have asked Gauteng’s police commissioner to prioritise this case. “The attitude of police officers who deal with rape victims has got to change,” he said. Tau said his party would support the woman when the case got to court.
