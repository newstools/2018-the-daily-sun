A MEMORIAL service for Pro Kid will be held today. A provincial funeral for the rapper will be held over the weekend. Post mortem results were released yesterday. The rapper, whose real name was Linda Mkhize, died last Wednesday. His family has revealed he suffered from rare gastrointestinal bleeding. Pro Kid’s cousin Nhlanhla Mohlauli told Drum: “We’re feeling much better. This ended speculations and wrong statements in the media that he died because of drugs and alcohol abuse. The results prove it was none of that.” He said the family was satisfied with the post mortem results. “We went for a presentation and were there when it was done.” He said even though everyone was welcome to attend the funeral, his alleged mistress was not. The funeral service will take place at the UJ Soweto campus on Sunday, and the rapper will be buried at West Park Cemetery.
