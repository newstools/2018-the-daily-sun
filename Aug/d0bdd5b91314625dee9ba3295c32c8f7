CAPTAIN KGB is back on the streets after being released on R5000 bail. Former crime intelligence officer Morris Tshabalala’s new bid for bail was based on new facts after it was denied in January. The Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Tshwane made the announcement yesterday. It heard that suspended Ipid investigator Cedrick Nkabinde lied about the number of calls between him and Tshabalala’s lawyer Mpesi Makhanya. Makhanya said Nkabinde told him he wanted to help Tshabalala and that he must be out on bail. Nkabinde denied this. Charges against Tshabalala include tricking cops by claiming money was needed to pay for blinds and curtains for a safe house and pocketing over R200 000.
