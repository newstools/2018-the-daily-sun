The North West police saved one of the world’s most endangered species. An African pangolin which was stolen on 1 August from the Rampapa Mountains in Mogwase, North West, was recovered by police acting on a tip off. The pangolin was allegedly stolen and brought to Rustenburg on Wednesday, 1 August 2018. Police acted on a tip-off from members of the community after they saw a suspicious-looking taxi in the Rustenburg Taxi Rank. The suspects had the petrified animal inside a plastic bag and were about to leave with it in a taxi when members of the Phokeng Stock Theft Unit pounced on them. The police allegedly stopped and searched the taxi. During the search, the pangolin, which is estimated to be worth R400 000, was found. It was discovered that the poachers wanted to sell the pangolin for R20 000. The animal was handed over to an animal expert, who is responsible for transporting the pangolin to the Hospital for Vulnerable Animals in Joburg. “It is alleged that pangolins, whose whole bodies are covered in scales, are caught due to unfounded beliefs of the great medicinal value of their scales,” police said in a statement. The two suspects, Surprise Nkomezulu (25) and Tlhobogang Daniel Mantsho (34) appeared at the Rustenburg Magistrates' Court on Friday (3 August). They were released on R2 500.00 bail each and are expected to appear in the same court again on Friday, 31 August 2018. “Nature conservation is everyone's priority and that the police will ensure that endangered species are fiercely protected,” Cluster Commander Major General Arthur Adams said.
