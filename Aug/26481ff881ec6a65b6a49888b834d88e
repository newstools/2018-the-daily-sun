TWO boys’ lives were cut short while they were collecting plastic for a school recycling competition. Ntokozo Khumalo (12) and Ayabonga Dlamini (9) from Bhekuzulu Village in Vryheid, northern KZN, drowned in a dumpsite dam on Saturday. A 12-year-old girl who was also collecting plastic was allegedly with the two boys from Bhekuzulu Primary School. When the three saw plastic scattered all over the dam, they got inside and collected it. Afterwards, the boys tried to swim but drowned. Ayabonga’s madala Bheki Mntambo (53) said they were shocked when the girl arrived with cops at their house with the sad news. “The girl told us they gained entry to the dam through a hole in the fence. “She said they used the hole because the guards at the gate denied them entry. “The boys then jumped into the dam and asked her to join them, but she refused as she was scared.” Bheki said when the girl saw the two were struggling to swim, she screamed for help and the guards tried to rescue them but their efforts were in vain as the dam is very deep. “My grandson’s body was recovered on Sunday after a long wait, while the other boy’s body was recovered on Saturday. “He wanted to win the competition so badly and that’s why they spent Saturday collecting plastic. They were told to collect a lot of plastic and bring it to school,” said Bheki. Abaqulusi municipal manager Bonga Ntanzi said they were very saddened by the loss and would make sure they closed the hole in the fence. “We built it as a dumpsite dam, so it’s very deep and dangerous.” Cops spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “An inquest docket was opened at Vryheid Police Station for investigation.”
