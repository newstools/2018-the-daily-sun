HE was desperately trying to save what would have been
his fourteenth person when Joseph Blackson (36) sunk beneath the waves and
drowned. According to Punch,
Joseph is being hailed as a hero by the community of Bakama in Rivers State,
Nigeria for his life-saving efforts following a boat accident last Saturday. About 25 people were pitched into the river water while
being ferried on a passenger boat from Abonnema Wharf to Bakana. A friend of Joseph named only as Benibo told Punch: “Until his death, he was a
contractor, supplying diesel in Trans Amadi to companies there. “He didn’t use a life jacket
like others did. He gave up the ghost in the process of rescuing them.” Some of the details are fuzzy. Some reports claim the
boat driver was going too fast or that it capsized because of the pollution in
the river, while others lay the blame for the fatal accident on recent heavy rains. There are different accounts about the number of
fatalities, with some putting the number at six, while others say it was two. What’s certain though is Joseph’s two young kids will
grow up without a dad and his wife is now a widow.
