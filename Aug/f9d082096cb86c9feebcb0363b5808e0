CARRYING CVs instead of placards, they wanted jobs, learnerships, business opportunities, social investment and bursaries. On Wednesday, jobless youth marched to five mines around Brits, North West. Organiser and chairman of the Villages, Townships and Small Dorpies Chamber of Commerce Robert Ngwenya told mine bosses they must bring back former premier Supra Mahumapelo. “We want the mines to employ people from this community. Where you get the jobs, I don’t know. These people will help your production. You will be protected for the coming years, knowing you’ve listened to us.” Ngwenya, who previously offered to donate cattle to Jacob Zuma to help him pay back the Nkandla money, said Premier Job Mokgoro didn’t know what he was doing but listened to friends. “Don’t think because Supra is no longer premier, we’re dead. Mokgoro must respect us and we’ll respect him.” After the marchers threatened to shut down the mines, the bosses promised to have a look at their demands by Tuesday.
