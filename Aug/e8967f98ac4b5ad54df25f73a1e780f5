PARENTS often give their children names in the hope that they will live up to them. Gogo Nontsuku Nxina from Motherwell Nu 12 in Port Elizabeth is proof that children sometimes do just that. Her name means “many days” and she has indeed lived up to her name. Gogo Nontsuku turned 100 years old on 10 August and her wish was to have a big birthday celebration. On Wednesday, Human Heart Organisation, a local non-governmental organisation that looks after elderly people, surprised gogo with a big birthday celebration. Gogo Nontsuku told Daily Sun that she still felt strong even though she suffered from high blood pressure and diabetes. “The reason I’m still strong at my age is because I respected my elders. What is happening nowadays is very painful. Kids drink alcohol,use drugs and there’s a lot of teenage pregnancy. How will they reach the age of 60 if they behave so badly?” She was blessed with nine children, 37 grandchildren and many great grandchildren. Her grandson, Zolani Timi (28), said: “She is our role model “You can’t tell that she is 100 years old because she still does household chores.”
