Korea were in raptures yesterday when their leader arrived. He was welcomed by leaders from the Enlightened Christian
Gathering (ECG) South Korea branch before leading hundreds in a service, Nyasa Times reports. This is part of ECGâ€™s Global Prophetic Tour, which has
set the goal of winning two million souls to Jesus Christ by the end of the
year. Next Bushiri will travel to Dubai, Tanzania and Malawi.
