TWENTY families from Masnex squatter camp near Margate on the south coast are left with only the clothes on their backs. This comes after 20 shacks were destroyed by fire on Tuesday. One of the victims, Thanduxolo Magazi (30), said: “We lost everything including important documents such as IDs and Sassa cards. “We don’t know how long it will take for us to recover from this because most of us are unemployed.” Another resident told Daily Sun they suspect the fire was started by a jilted man who discovered that his girlfriend was cheating on him. “He caught them red-handed in the other man’s shack. Although he did not cause a scene, he seemed very angry. Later, an uncontrollable fire started in the man’s shack,” said the resident. He said their suspicions may be right because both men have since vanished from the area. In another incident in Kenville, Durban, three shacks caught fire on Wednesday, leaving three families homeless. Although it’s not clear what caused the fire, which also destroyed a vehicle, residents suspect it may have been caused by faulty wiring. Victim Linda Ngubane (45) said the fire started in one of the shacks and spread. Linda said his car was parked near his shack and it also caught fire. “I lost everything. I’m only left with the clothes that I’m wearing,” he said. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed three shacks caught fire at Kenville on Wednesday. “The cause of the fire is unknown,” he said.
