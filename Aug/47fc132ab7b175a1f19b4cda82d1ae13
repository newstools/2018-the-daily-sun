A PHOTO of ANC MPL Bishop Vusi Dube with what appears to be a R5 assault rifle did not only cause a stir among social network users. Opposition parties in KZN have also weighed in. They have called for his immediate arrest for illegal possession of a firearm! Dube, founder of the eThekwini Community Church, is a big supporter of former president Jacob Zuma. He has been using his church to organise ANC supporters to support Zuma in court. The photo was posted by EFF MPL Vusi Khoza on Sunday. In his tweet, Khoza captioned the photo with the words: “Dear, SAPS. Please investigate this criminal. “He is a supporter of another criminal called Jacob Zuma.” Khoza told Daily Sun yesterday he was serious about his call to cops to investigate Dube. “Cops must just do their work and arrest the man. He must explain where he got such a dangerous firearm. “Cops must charge him with illegal possession, even if it wasn’t his firearm. “The law is clear that no one is allowed to posses a firearm he is not licensed to hold,” said Khoza He said Dube should produce his firearm licence to show he was trained to handle guns. If he didn’t, it would mean he posed a danger and could pull the trigger by mistake and injure other people. He said his party would raise the issue when the Legislature opened on 30 August. The IFP’s Blessed Gwala called Dube a fake bishop. He said if he was a true believer in God, he wouldn’t have a desire for guns. Gwala also said cops should investigate Dube’s association with armed people. DA leader Zwakele Mncwango called Dube irresponsible. But the gun-toting bishop lashed out at the parties and challenged them to go to the police. He claimed the picture was taken many years ago. ANC spokeswoman Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said opposition parties were opportunistic. She said the ANC would call Dube and get his side of the story.
