WHEN Rachel Ngoepe applied for an RDP house back in 2003, she never thought she would still be living in a shack 15 years later. She told Daily Sun her dream was to live in her own house with her three children. The 53-year-old is from Schoongesight Village outside Bochum, Limpopo. She said she was sad because she was given her own house, but can’t live in it because it’s already occupied by someone else. She told the People’s Paper that every time she went to the Blouberg Municipality to check on the progress of her house, she was told she was still on the waiting list. Rachel said she couldn’t believe it when an official told her two weeks ago that her house had already been given to someone else. She took the matter up with the provincial human settlements department, where she was told a site had been approved. “I went back to the municipality and officials told me to bring my ID so they could take my name off the system and put me on a waiting list as a priority. “I can’t be on a waiting list when there’s already a house in my name. My children shouldn’t be suffering when they already have a home,” she said. Rachel’s house is situated in Desmond Park, Bochum. “I’m hurt that after so many years of waiting for my RDP the ward committee and councillor betrayed me and gave my house to someone else. “The municipality must make a plan and move me into a house,” said Rachel. Paena Galane, spokesman forthe Limpopo Department of Co-operative Governance, Human Settlements, said the department was investigating the matter.
