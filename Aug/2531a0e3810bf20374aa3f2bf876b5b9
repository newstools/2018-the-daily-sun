HE would call her “Pet” while they had sex. She was
instructed to call him “Master”. This was one of the pervy things a teacher from South
Island, New Zealand would insist on as he “sexually tortured” a schoolgirl, the
New Zealand Herald is reporting. The unnamed, married father was sentenced to
four-and-a-half years behind bars this week in Christchurch District Court. Speaking during the sentencing, the girl’s dad slammed
the teacher as "extremely evil and dangerous". The sexual torture involved the teenaged schoolgirl using
sex toys, wearing leather handcuffs, a dog collar and a leash, and calling him “Master”. Their sexual relationship took place from January to May
last year. The two has started communicating by school email two
years before they had sex. They then switched to personal emails. "The email content between the defendant and
complainant was extremely sexual, with graphic details and descriptions of the
sexual acts they had done and wanted to do with each other," the summary
of facts states. "It is clear through these communications that the
defendant is in control of the relationship, he had described numerous
degrading and humiliating acts he wants to do to the victim." The girl’s dad described how his daughter had gone from a
healthy A student to a damaged girl on medication that has left her "like
a zombie with dead fish eyes". The teacher pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual
connection with a person under 16, and a charge of exposing a young person to
indecent material.
