He has been president since 1986 and he can now rule for as long as he lives. A lawyer for a group of Ugandan opposition leaders has warned that President Yoweri Museveni, 73, is heading for a "life presidency". This is after a court upheld a constitutional amendment scrapping presidential age limits. Previously the law required presidential contenders to be under the age of 75. This would have blocked Museveni, president since 1986, from seeking re-election in polls due in 2021. But a bill removing the limit was introduced in parliament in September and signed into law in December, sparking demonstrations and an outcry from the opposition which accuses Museveni of a power grab. "The court has entrenched a life presidency - one man rule," said human rights lawyer Ladislaus Rwakafuzi who represented the coalition seeking to have age limits reinstated. "I think our judges lacked the courage to tell the president he's been around long enough."  A majority of the constitutional court judges, sitting in the remote city of Mbale, some 225km east of the capital Kampala, ruled in favour of lifting the age cap for presidential contenders.
