ANGRY hostel dwellers from around Soweto vandalised the Pikitup depot in Diepkloof, Soweto yesterday. A security guard at the depot told Daily Sun that the large group broke down the gate and protested in the premises. He said the next thing, they saw flames from one of the recycling buildings. Two buildings caught fire and everything inside burned down. The protesters told Daily Sun that they were not playing. “After we burnt that truck last week, we told them we would come for more if they didn’t listen. They didn’t listen,” said one of the protesters. “This is nothing compared to what we are capable of doing. They should give us jobs and all this will be over,” said another protester (36). The protest began last week when the protesters locked the depot gates, demanding jobs. After a few days, they burned down a truck and stoned another one. They vowed to do more damage if their demands were not met. They said they would continue the protest until people from the Eastern Cape who were hired by Pikitup were sent back. “We won’t give them a R7 000 bribe like those people did. We will disrupt them until they give us jobs,” said one protester. Joburg Environmental, Infrastructure and Service Delivery MMC Nico de Jager said: “While the City respects every resident’s right to protest,it must be within the confines of the law. The City will not be intimidated by criminals.”
