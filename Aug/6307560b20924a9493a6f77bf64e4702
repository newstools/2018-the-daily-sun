Gauteng cops have arrested a 34-year-old man who is the
sixth and last suspect in the 2017 murder case of actor Dumisani Masilela. The suspect will make his first court appearance before
the Benoni Magistrate Court on Monday 20 August . He will then join his alleged accomplices set for trial
in the  Pretoria High Court from 8 to 19 October 2018. A year ago Masilela was fatally shot during a hijacking
in Tembisa South. Police were able
to establish that a total of six suspects were behind the murder. The initial four were arrested last year, while the
fifth suspect died in a robbery. All suspects have been positively linked to five cases - the
murder of Dumisani Masilela, three carjackings reported in Daveyton, Phokeng,
and Siyabuswa respectively; and a case in Boitekong of possession of stolen
cellphone. The Provincial Commissioner of Police in Gauteng,
Lieutenant General Deliwe de Lange has commended the intelligence-led
multi-disciplinary team of investigators for their tireless effort in making
sure that all six suspects are rounded up and arrested. "This successful arrest brought about by such
meticulous investigation, will go a long way in ensuring that serious and
violent crimes plaguing Gauteng, are reduced to their lowest level", said
De Lange.
