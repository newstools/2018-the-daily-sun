ERICK Lekaba said rubbish has changed his life for the better. Erick (29) from Greenside extension 78 outside Polokwane uses recycled material to build house models. He said he always wanted to be an architecht, and his business gives him an idea what was like to be in the construction industry. “This is my God-given talent. I’m proud of the art I produce,” said Erick. He said South Africa’s high unemployment rate forced him to rely on himself. “I love my work. Not only because it keeps me busy but also because I can make money from what I do,” he said. “I depend on this business to put food on the table for my family.” The talented artist also paints and draws house plans. He said he use old boxes, plastic bags, paints and wire to build his models. “I started doing this in primary school. The response I got from my teachers encouraged me to work harder.” Erick said he felt good when people bought his models. “My products attract many customers. Seeing my business grow makes me feel good about my work.” He said sometimes he wakes up early in the morning to sketch plans before he starts building his models. “It usually takes two days to complete a model but sometimes I need more time, depending on the size of the house I’m building.” He said he wanted to pass on his skills to the youth because they could help them stay away from a life of crime.
