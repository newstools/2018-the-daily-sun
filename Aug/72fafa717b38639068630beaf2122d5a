SAFETY is a priority and getting rid of crime their mission and vision. This was outlined by the Gauteng Department of Community Safety at a #ThumaMina Peace Walk in Laudium, Tshwane on Saturday. Head of department Yoliswa Makhasi led the walk. She said the campaign to work with the community and fight crime in the area was important. She said they will have a similar walk and police operation in Etwatwa and Daveyton, in Ekurhuleni tomorrow. Makhasi was accompanied by anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee, community leaders, representatives of civil organisations and police. The aim of the initiative is to fight gender-based violence and to promote a good relationship between the community and cops. Abramjee said residents were demanding the completion of Erasmia Police Station. Ward 61 Councillor Mahomed Essop added: “We need visible policing and for the police to always be vigilant.” The walk started at Laudium Police Station and proceeded to some of the crime hot spots identified by residents,
