FOR eight years, residents from Masodi Village outside Mokopane in Limpopo have been promised a new school. The nearby Ratunku Primary School remains overcrowded. But to this day the area promised to house the new facility remains an open field. The school was never built and pupils who cannot stand the overcrowded school of 1 500 pupils have to walk at least 10km to the nearest schools in other villages. Earlier this week, Democratic Alliance members visited the village to check on what they said was the department failing residents. National DA spokesman Solly Malatsi said they met with affected residents and heard that even grade R pupils are forced to cross the busy N11. He said it is worrying because the department has not taken care of the children’s safety. “The land promised for the school is now becoming an open space that has become a dangerous area where incidents of robbery and rape have been reported. “The local children are forced to attend the overcrowded school because of the department of education’s failure to build them a new school,” Malatsi said. Limpopo Education spokesman Sam Makondo said although they acknowledge the problem in the area, it was the opposition party which had undertaken to speak to affected residents. “Given the need for a school in that community, this is one of the schools that were approved, pending availability of resources in the department. “The delay was made worse by the fact that the department was put under administration and many projects came to a halt. That means the department had to stabilise finances. “As things stand, the school is still identified. “Planning is under way in this financial year and implementation will take place in the 2019/20 financial year. “We know the community is growing and we must reduce overcrowding at the current school,” Makondo said.
