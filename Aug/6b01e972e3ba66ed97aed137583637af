CONVICTED ANC Councillor Bongo Nombiba will not be able to appeal against his sentence. Yesterday the Grahamstown High Court dismissed the Nelson Mandela Bay councillor’s application. The 43-year-old was found guilty of fraud and money laundering by Magistrate Johannes Claassen in the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court in March and sentenced to five years in jail. After having been out on R2 000 bail, he must now return to prison. Nombiba was bust by the Hawks in 2016 and charged with fraud, two counts of corruption and money laundering. He was found guilty of the fraud and money laundering charges, but was acquitted on the two counts of corruption. Nombiba was arrested after it was found he had pocketed R20 000 from a special municipal fund that was part of a donation to the Thulamangwane Community Project in KwaZakhele. When the project approached him for money, he asked that the NGO not put an amount in writing. In the request sent to the municipality, Nombiba motivated for a donation of R30 000 and he then took R20 000 for himself. NPA spokesman Tsepo Ndwalaza said: “I confirm the Nombiba appeal was dismissed by the high court. “He has to hand himself over to Correctional Services within seven working days so that he can serve his sentence. “The only option for him and his legal team now is to petition the Supreme Court of Appeal.” The councillor did not want to comment.
