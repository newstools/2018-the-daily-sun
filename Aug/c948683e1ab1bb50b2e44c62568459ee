POLICE Minister Bheki Cele said punishment for cop killers must be harsher. He was speaking at New Apostolic Church in Mitchell’s Plain, Cape Town, where a memorial service was held for three cops Constables Lonwabo Kili and Siyamcela Ncipa were shot dead on Friday, while Constable Arthur Mantu was burnt in his car on 10 August. Mnonele Ngomane, Constable Kili’s relative, said the officer loved his family. “He never let a Sunday pass without going to church. He was a man of God,” said Ngomane. He said Kili was facing challenges at the time of his death. “He was involved in an accident and his car was written off, but he survived,” he said. Jongikhaya Ncipa, Constable Ncipa’s relative, said his family lost a great leader. “He left behind young children,” he said. Speaking about the dead cops’ kids, Cele said: “There’s no way the children of our soldiers are going to drop out of school.” He told the cops to use the tools at their disposal to fight thugs who attacked them.
