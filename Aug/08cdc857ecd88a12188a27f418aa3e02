WHAT was supposed to be a hawkers’ complex has turned into an unofficial public toilet. Street hawker Mathabo Modupe (56) said men often relieved themselves at the stalls being built in Botshabelo, Mangaung. Mathabo said whenever she tried to reprimand the men, they would tell her to mind her own business. She said some had threatened to urinate on the meat she sold if she kept bothering them. Mathabo said she used to sell 200 plates of food a day. But ever since men started urinating in the unfinished stalls, people had been avoiding her like the plague. She said customers covered their noses whenever they passed the stalls. Mathabo blamed the municipality for not completing construction quickly enough. She said she had no problems before the municipality started building the stalls “Now I have to borrow money to pay for my daughter’s transport,” she said. When Daily Sun spoke to a man who was caught urinating inside one of the stalls, he said he worked at a shopping complex and couldn’t afford to pay R2 to relieve himself. “Most of the times, the public toilets are out of order,” said the man. Mangaung municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said he was aware of the situation. Khedama said the municipality would hire 24-hour security services to guard the site until construction was completed.
