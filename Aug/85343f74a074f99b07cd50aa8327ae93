TWO grade 2 pupils have had an experience they will never forget. The pupils from a school in Ekurhuleni were allegedly sexually molested by three grade 7 pupils at the school. According to the boys’ parents, the incident happened more than once in the school’s toilet block. To make things worse, when they reported the matter to the school, the principal allegedly swept it under the carpet. The 34-year-old mum of an eight-year-old boy saidshe noticed something was not right when her son came home without his underwear. “He couldn’t sit properly and he came home with a hole in his pants.” She said when she asked him what was wrong he wouldn’t tel her. A 28-year-old mother of a seven-year-old said her son had nightmares and ended up screaming. She said he only said he was being bullied by big boys at school. She asked the mother of the other boy if her son was also acting strangely. The two parents brought the kids together and they told their mothers how they had been sexually abused. The parents said the principal promised to investigate. “But to this day nothing has been done about those boys,” said one mum. The abused boys have been moved to another school and a case of rape opened with the police. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said the pupils were receiving continuous counselling and extra academic classes at the new school. “We strongly condemn any misdemeanour in schools which could lead to serious action being taken against involved pupils. Anyone found to be transgressing this policy will be dealt with in line with the South African Schools Act.” He said support is being provided to both victims and perpetrators.
