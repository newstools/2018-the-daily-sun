DEPUTY minister of police Bongani Mkongi’s visit brought hope to families with unsolved crime cases. Mkongi visited Overberg communities which include Hermanus, Grabouw and Kleinmond in the Western Cape last month. Nomazwe Bayana (39) told the deputy minister that her 19-year-old son was murdered by someone they know in January. “I did not even receive a case number,” she said. Mkongi told Nomazwe he would make sure that someone followed up the case and made an arrest. A month later, Nomazwe told Daily Sun: “No one came to me and made a follow-up as promised by the minister. “I went back to the police station and was told that the murder case was cold. “I want my son’s killer arrested,” cried the sad mum. Mncedi was stabbed to death at a local tavern. Western Cape police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “The case has been followed up on various occasions and the suspect has been identified as ‘Park’. “No clear identification could be obtained except for this nickname.”
