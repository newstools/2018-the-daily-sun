Majority of the people if not all watch pornography alone but it is really is okay to watch it with your partner. Many say that porn gives unrealistic expectations when it comes to sex but there are many varieties when it comes to porn and you can pick and choose what you want. According to a study, partners who come clean about watching porn to their significant others have happier and better relationships. As much as this might bring excitement, it might also bring in a threat in the relationship when the other partner isn't honest about their consumption of porn. "Being honest about pornography use with a partner indicates that the person is comfortable with their own sexuality and the things that sexually titillate, stimulate, arouse, and turn-on their excitation,” said Dr. Fran Walfish. When couples do not disclose their porn use to their partner, Walfish believes this secrecy can be felt as a “betrayal and raise mistrust, suspicions, and put a wedge of distance between the partners.” Here are the reason why you should watch porn with your partner: 1. It teaches you about your partner's fantasies Some people are very shy to share their fantasies and that might be the exact thing that turns them on. A clip from pornography might be able to tell you this. 2. It speeds up foreplay This might be very important for couple who live fast paced lives or have children and are always busy. With the right arousal, one can reach their orgasm quicker before the kids come knocking on the door. 3. It is a shared experience Any time a couple can share a hobby, or even better, a sexual experience, they are investing in the longevity of their relationship. 4. It may lessen the need to act out on sexual desires outside of your relationship. Home is where the heart is, and home can also be the place where all of your sexual needs and fantasies are met.
