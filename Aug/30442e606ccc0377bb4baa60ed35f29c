A DANCER associated with Afrotainment boss DJ Tira is being charged with rape. The man appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court yesterday after being accused of raping a 13-year-old girl. He was arrested on Monday and appeared for a bail hearing yesterday, which was postponed until today. His attorney Shameer Goolabjith tried to convince the court the application should be heard urgently as the accused is a celebrity. “The applicant has contracts with companies that have booked him,” he said. Prosecutor Nsiki Qhunyiswa argued the accused should not be given special treatment and the matter should be decided when the investigative officer was available to testify. Allegedly, the girl was alone after church when the accused came to her home and raped her. She later told friends at school about the incident and her teachers were informed. The girl’s 28-year-old sister told Daily Sun a teacher called her family to suggest opening a rape case. “The man was arrested on Monday at our home after he came to try and persuade us to withdraw the case.” She told the SunTeam her sister trusted the accused because of his contribution to uplifting youth. “But he broke her and our family’s trust. She’s scared people won’t believe her story.”
