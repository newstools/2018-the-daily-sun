PEOPLE who are deaf or hard of hearing will soon be able to navigate their surroundings. They will be able to use a wristband that conveys sounds through vibrations and LED lights. “Senso” was invented by Cofimvaba-born Zuko Mandlakazi (33), who studied at Walter Sisulu University. Zuko will launch it in October, but has received more than 40 orders already. He said it was inspired by his hard-of-hearing aunt. In creating a concept to address the challenges she faced, he started thinking about the millions of others who had the same challenge. “My aunt lip-reads to understand what people say. We have always had to speak very loudly to her and I realised the city did not cater for her condition,” he said. “I looked for devices she could use, but those available were too expensive and surgery had to be performed for a speaker to be inserted inside a person’s inner ear.” He took it upon himself to find a cost- effective device that would help people, but money was a stumbling block. “The device we developed was not good enough as proof of concept to raise more funding, so we entered business competitions to raise funds.” The contests brought Zuko the capital for his invention, as did the Gauteng Accelerator Programme’s ICT Award and the SAB Foundation’s Social Innovation Award. “Through cash prizes we developed the first proof of concept to raise funding that has seen us develop the product to today.” Senso was named one of the top 50 African Innovations at the Africa Innovation Summit in Rwanda earlier this year.
