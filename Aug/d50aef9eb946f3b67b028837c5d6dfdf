The anchor of the Best of the Breakfast Show on 702 will not be returning to his morning slot just as yet. 702 announced on their Twitter account that he will be stepping in for Joanne Joseph on the afternoon drive show while she is away for a couple of weeks. Gwala has been away from the airwaves for months after being diagnosed with colon cancer. Last month, the station announced that Gwala was now cancer free and well on his way to full recovery.
