The Thohoyandou High Court has sentenced a
habitual rapist to five life terms and 50 years in jail. rapist Kenneth Manabela (31) from Mbokota
village outside Makhado was sentenced to five life terms for rape and 50 years
for two counts of rape and kidnapping. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe
said these long jail terms follow his arrest on November 2011 for two rape cases
where he appeared before the Waterval Magistrate's Court and later released on
bail. After that he continued with his reign of
terror raping defenseless women. He was again arrested in December 2012 for
two counts of kidnapping and 2 counts of rape and he was again released on bail
by the Hlanganani Magistrate's Court. Ngoepe said he continued with his evil
deeds of raping women until he was arrested for the third time in March 2017
after he raped an 18 -year-old girl at knifepoint. His victims are aged between 13 and 18. He was terrorising the areas of Mbokota, Bungeni
and Chavani in the Waterval area outside Makhado. "The accused's modus operandi is that once
he came across his victims, he would threaten them with a knife or screwdriver,
force them to his homestead in Mbokota area, rape and assault them afterwards,"
said Ngoepe. The Saps Provincial Commissioner in Limpopo
,Lieutenant General Nneke Jim Ledwaba has applauded the joint efforts by all
the role players and he stressed that this sentencing will serve as an
impediment to all those who find themselves on the wrong side of the law
especially those who are targeting the vulnerable citizens. "We hope that these jail terms will
bring a relief to those affected especially now that the heartless criminal
will be where he belongs for his entire life", said Ledwaba.
