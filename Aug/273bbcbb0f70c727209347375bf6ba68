THEMBA Zondi built himself a veranda at the front of his shack so he could enjoy fresh air. But the 49-year-old man from Kenville in Durban said he couldn’t sit on the veranda anymore and had to sit at the tuck shop nearby instead. That was because he was being chased away from his two-roomed shack by the smell of kak coming from toilets right opposite his home. “I moved from Inanda in 1999 because I wanted to find a piece job,” said Themba. “I built my shack and later a veranda. Then the toilets were installed in 2007. “I didn’t think they would cause such problems for me. “There was a woman who used to clean them, but she hasn’t been coming since last year.” Themba said the separate toilets for men and women were both leaking. The men’s toilets were also blocked and kak was coming out from the back. “The unbearable smell comes into my shack. This has been a problem since last year.” He said he often had flu and feared he would eventually catch TB. “This is a health hazard for me. But I’m stuck here.  I’ve nowhere else to go and wish the municipality would remove the toilets and put them in an area which is far from houses.” At the time of going to print, the municipality had not responded to the SunTeam’s requests for comment.
