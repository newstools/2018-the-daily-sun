YET another cop has been shot by thugs. Warrant Officer Michael Danisa was hit and wounded during an exchange of fire in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni in the early hours of yesterday morning. Cops apparently had to jump out of their moving vehicle when the thugs opened fire and Danisa was shot in the left shoulder. He is recovering in hospital. Police spokesman Captain Piet Rossouw said officers were patrolling when they spotted a suspicious white Ford Ranger with four occupants, which they followed to Vumbuka squatter camp. He said the vehicle stopped and the occupants started shooting at police, who returned fire. Rossouw said the Ford Ranger sped away and it was unknown whether any suspects were hit. “Luckily, the police vehicle came to a standstill in a ditch next to a shack,” he said. He said AK 47 and R5 cartridges were found on the scene and appealed to anyone with information to come forward.
