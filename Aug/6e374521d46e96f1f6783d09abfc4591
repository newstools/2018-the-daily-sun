FAMILY members of late gospel star S’fiso Ncwane are worried that a cloud of bad luck is about to come down on them. This is because they have not ended their mourning period as they don’t have money for an unveiling ceremony. S’fiso’s sister Gugu and mum Fikile told Daily Sun that a traditional cleansing ceremony should have been held in December to mark one year since the gospel singer died. However, they couldn’t afford a goat or cow. “This ceremony is compulsory so my brother’s soul can rest in peace and become a good ancestor,” said Gugu. She said S’fiso sometimes appeared in their dreams, but she wasn’t willing to say what had happened in the dreams. She said they couldn’t discuss the issue with S’fiso’s wife Ayanda as she wasn’t speaking to them. “If we get the money, we will do the ceremony, whether she comes or not,” said Gugu. Fikile pleaded with anyone who can help pay for the ceremony to come forward. When the SunTeam contacted Ayanda, she responded by email and said no one had contacted her about the ceremony. “I’m shocked. I’ve never heard that a married man’s unveiling could be held outside his home,” she said. “Nobody will do my husband’s unveiling but myself as his wife.” Cultural expert Professor Jabulani Maphalala said the family would experience problems if the unveiling was not performed soon.
