MDONSO Ngcobo says joining Ukhozi FM was the biggest mistake of her life. The former co-host of the Sigiya Ngengoma show with Zimdollar told Daily Sun after joining the station in April, she started receiving death threats. Mdonso resigned on Wednesday, claiming the station’s management was ignoring the situation. She said after she joined the station, she started getting calls from private numbers threatening to kill her if she didn’t resign. She said the callers would phone her before and after the show, which airs on Saturdays, warning her to watch her back. “I was insulted, told I was good for nothing and I would die if I didn’t leave the show because it was supposed to be hosted by someone else. “At first I thought it was something that would eventually stop, but it carried on.” Mdonso, whose real name is Nonhlahla, said she reported the matter to the station management but nothing was done about it, leaving her feeling as if her bosses didn’t care about her life. She said she didn’t report the matter to the cops because she hoped the station would do something. “I felt so helpless and unprotected. I would get a call a few seconds before the show started. This thing went on until I decided to resign. I have only one life and I didn’t want to die for Ukhozi.” SABC spokeswoman Neo Momodu confirmed that Mdonso had resigned, but said Ukhozi FM did not accept her resignation. “Ukhozi FM management really want to investigate this matter to find out what happened. Therefore, Mdonso’s resignation was not accepted,” said Momodu.
