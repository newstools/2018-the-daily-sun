TENDA terrorises the royal family – and he is not about to stop any time soon! The character in the soapie Muvhango is played by Nat Ramabulana (34) from Tshilapfene, Thohoyandou in Limpopo. His role as the dodgy businessman named Tambulani developed into the rebellious Tendamudzimu, who has become the new mayor of Thathe. “Tenda likes to be in control and the position came in handy,” Nat said. Tenda was happy when his wife fell pregnant, but he learned the child was not his after his wife had been sleeping with Chief Azwindini. Nat, who has been married for three years and has three kids, said he himself would not know how to handle Tenda’s situation. “No man deserves to be in his position. It is tough, but the first option is to reconcile.” He said a fan once pleaded with him to leave Azwindini and Mulalo alone. “Tenda is not going to leave them alone. He has a score to settle with the chief.” He said he first decided at school he wanted to be on TV: “I was very shy but recited a poem at school and my English teacher praised me. “The next year, I played in a drama. That’s when I decided it was what I wanted to do,” said Nat, who studied drama at Wits. His first professional role was a soldier in The Trail, a French movie filmed in Namibia. “I played the lead role in Justice For All , as well as in Master Harold And The Boys. On set he is always in a suit but he prefers sneakers and T-shirts. His favourite meal is pap, chakalaka chicken and Coke: “I like the combination,” he said.
