SHE would always carry a bag and hung around doggy men. This raised eyebrows in Kameeldrift, Tshwane, and residents contacted the cops. Police visited her home on Tuesday and found dagga and bust her. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Portia Maleka said cops received a tip-off about the woman. “When they arrived at her home, they searched the premises and found 106kg of dagga, rizzlas and an undisclosed amount of cash,” she said. Maleka told the People’s Paper the woman was then arrested. She will appear in the Cullinan Magistrates Court soon.
