The DA top brass is expected to start discussions on replacing outgoing Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille on Monday (13 August). De Lille’s resignation was announced last week by her and DA leader Mmusi Maimane in Cape Town. “We are going to discuss the matter, but the decision is likely to be taken by Federal Executive. The Federal Executive is meeting next weekend because they handle the process of electing a new mayor,” Western Cape DA leader Bonginkosi Madikizela has been quoted as saying. De Lille, in an interview with a radio station, recently said that she was “not finished” with the DA. She indicated that she will be pursuing lawsuits against 12 members of the party, including councilors and members of parliament. One of the parliamentarians implicated was DA’s deputy chief whip in Parliament, Michael Waters.
