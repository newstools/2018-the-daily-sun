AFTER receiving SMSes on Saturday notifying them they were owed money, two friends went to a tavern to celebrate. But things soon turned ugly, and today one of the men is dead! They were confronted by thugs demanding money as they left the tavern. The heartless tsotsis stabbed one of the men, while the other one ran for his life. Philani Dlamini (35) from Ghana section in Bekkersdal, Rand West City, told Daily Sun that two men who followed them out of the tavern attacked them after they left. “They demanded money and when we told them we did not have any, they said we were lying as we had received cash from Sars,” he said. “They took out knives. I managed to escape but my friend, Daliwonga Ndevu (29), was not so lucky. They stabbed him and he died on the spot.” Philani said they had both received SMSes saying they would be paid R4 316 before the end of next month. They had worked as machine operators at a mine in Westonaria before they were retrenched last year. A murder case was opened at Bekkersdal Police Station.
