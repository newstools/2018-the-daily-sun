A taxi driver was shot twice in the head by two passengers, at an entrance of a distribution centre in Canelands, KwaZulu Natal on Tuesday. Reaction Unit South Africa spokesperson Prem Balram said
they were called out to the scene by a farmer who was driving by. “He was driving alongside the white Toyota Quantum and heard
the gunshots,” Balram said. The taxi came to a standstill after the shooting. The two
suspects were then seen fleeing on foot towards a river. Balram said according to the passengers, both suspects were holding
firearms. Following that several passengers also fled the scene
fearing for their lives. Balram said a bullet was recovered inside the minibus taxi. Reaction Officers conducted a search for the suspects and
are currently awaiting assistance of the SAPS Dog Unit.
