IKUSASALETHU Secondary School in Braamfischerville, Soweto has become a war zone. Last week alone, at least three pupils were stabbed. According to a source at the school, some pupils have resorted to carrying pangas to school to protect themselves. The source told Daily Sun that an ongoing war was a result of gangsterism. “The gangs are formed outside the school, but when they clash they bring their fights to the school. Pupils no longer feel safe.” A grade 12 pupil said: “We want the education department to get involved and root out all these gangsters from the school, because their constant fighting is disturbing us. We are close to writing exams and we do not want this drama.” The pupils claimed that every time there was an incident of stabbing, the principal would expel people. “But this does not put a stop to these barbaric acts. The department must put a plan into action that will see all gangsters banished from entering the school,” said another pupil. Mabongi Mhlongo (42) said she was afraid to send her 15-year-old son to school. “I fear he will go and never come back,” she said. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said the department was investigating the matter. “The school will institute disciplinary processes pending the outcome of the investigation.” Mabona reminded pupils that schools are institutions for teaching and learning, and should be treated as such. “We strongly condemn any acts of misconduct that seek to undermine the dignity of pupils and teachers.” He said the necessary support would be provided to affected pupils.
