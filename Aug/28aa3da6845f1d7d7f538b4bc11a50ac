PIKITUP has decided to suspend its services around Soweto due to a protest by hostel residents for the past week. Residents began their action outside the Pikitup Diepkloof depot on Monday last week, when they closed the gate. On Thursday the residents blocked the same depo with stones and burning tires. They torched one Pikitup truck on Friday, stoned others and threatened to return and do more damage if they were not listened to. They told Daily Sun they wanted to be hired by Pikitup “by force”. Pikitup released a statement yesterday about suspending services. The statement read: “It is regrettable that Pikitup has to suspend services due to its staff being threatened with violence . . . and unable to leave depots every morning to carry out their daily duties.” The statement said that as of yesterday morning the affected depots included Central Camp and Zondi, where violent protesters demand to be in-sourced and absorbed despite not meeting criteria during a process currently under way. “Pikitup has raised the concerns with our political principals and sought assistance from JMPD and SAPS; however, the situation continues unabated,” it said. Pikitup managing director Lungile Dhlamini advised depot managers it would be irresponsible to allow their staff to work under such conditions as their safety could not be guaranteed until a political solution had been found. Areas affected include Diepkloof, Orlando East and West, Meadowlands, Dube, Noordgesig, Pennyville, Klipspruit, Motsoaledi, Pimville, Kliptown, Senaone, Dlamini, Moroka, Mfolo South, North and Central, Protea Glen, Zondi, Jabavu, Central Western Jabavu, Jabulani, Dobsonville, Chiawelo, Protea Glen Ridge, Emdeni, Phiri, Mapetla, Slovoville, Green Village, Longtill, Sgodiphola and Lefhureng.
