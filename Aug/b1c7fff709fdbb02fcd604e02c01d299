GET IT first from the bones. Scores of Sangomas have gathered outside the Tshwane City Council Chambers to predict Tshwane Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga’s fate. This follows a motion of no confidence which is set to take place on Thursday afternoon. While the council committee is busy discussing government related matters, The Peoples Paper asked Sangoma Dungamanzi from Wattvile about Msimanga’s fate. Dungamanzi threw his bones and told Daily Sun that Msimanga will survive the motion. According to Dungamazi, Msimanga is set to surprise many despite the ANC and EFF having enough numbers in the council to oust him. Dungamanzi said Msimanga will survive and remain the Capital City's Mayor. “Msimanga has made a lot of mistakes but today he is definitely not going. "Maybe some other time we can see him gone but for now he will remain the Mayor of Tshwane despite the vote of no confidence,” said Dungamanzi. Meanwhile Msimanga  was also confident prior to the council sitting. He said: "When people think that they've won, they make a whole lot of silly mistakes and they will play themselves out today."
