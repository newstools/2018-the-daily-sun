THE driver of a judge in Uganda probably wouldn’t have
toyed around with a loaded gun and compared it to his 4-5 if he’d known it
would lead to his death. According to Daily
Monitor, Ismail Mayiga reported for duty at Justice Musa Sekaana’s house in
Kampala at 7am on Tuesday. There to guard the judge’s house was cop Daisy Nagasha. According to the statement that Daisy made at the copshop
after disaster struck, Ismail had been mocking her by saying that her gun could
not shoot him – unlike how his penis could shoot her. She said: “Mayiga held the muzzle of the gun and pulled
it saying it cannot shoot him, but it’s his “gun” (meaning his penis) that he
would use to shoot her.” Daisy said she struggled to get control of her gun back
from Ismail and warned him to stop his strange behaviour. “I also held the
gun. Suddenly, the gun discharged the bullet and hit him in the abdomen,” she
said in her statement. Justice Sekaana told Daily
Monitor: “Immediately after the loud bang, my house help came to me asking
for the keys of another car to take the driver to hospital because he had been
shot by the police guard. That is when I rushed out to see what was happening.
I saw the driver lying near the gate.” Ismail was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. He leaves behind a wife and kids. Cop spokesman, Emilian Kayima, said: “It is a regrettable
incident; currently all indications show it was not intended but an accident.
Still, this matter is being investigated.”
