Local TV star Bonang Matheba will be taking legal action against the Sunday World newspaper following their controversial cover story titled "Bonang tax fraud drama". In its 26 August edition the publication claimed that Bonang was summonsed to appear in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crime Court last week on charges of tax fraud. The claims were refuted by both Bonang and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Davin Phillips the executive director of Celebrity Services Africa, who represent Bonang, told Channel24 that the article "contains factual errors" and that Bonang "was never summonsed to appear and never appeared on charges of tax fraud".NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane told Channel24 that Bonang did not appear in court and that there is no official tax fraud case on the roll against her as it stands. "The matter was not enrolled pending further investigations," Mjonondwane said. Now Channel24 has learnt that Bonang will be taking legal action against the newspaper for “damages done to her good name and character”.Bonang is demanding R10m in damages from the publication. Channel24 reached out to Sunday World editor Mapula Nkosi several times via e-mail, telephone, and WhatsApp for comment but had not received feedback by the time of publishing this article. Should comment become available this article will be updated accordingly. SOURCE: THE JUICE
