“A LOT of poor students now have access to higher education and that is a welcome development.” Sizwe Nxasana said this after he resigned as chairman of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. Nxasana, who has been at the helm for three years, said students accessing financial aid after the #FeesMustFall protests had been a key highlight of his time at NSFAS. “Crafting support for these poor students after a government decision was key.” The #FeesMustFall protests saw higher learning institutions being shut as students demanded free education. About 400 000 students are benefitting after government took a decision with regard to free access to higher education, mostly for poor students. Nxasana told Daily Sun he would continue being involved in education through his education group and would offer advice to NSFAS. He said he was confident that Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor would steer NSFAS towards perfectly modelled policies. “There is no crisis at NSFAS. I informed the minister of my resignation on Monday and offered my support to ensure an orderly handover,” he said. “It’s been a privilege and honour to serve as an NSFAS board member and chairperson.” He said he was grateful for the opportunity. “Since December 2016, the NSFAS mandate and funding obligations increased exponentially,” he said. “I would like to recognise the many patriotic and committed South Africans who have contributed their expertise and resources to try and make quality education accessible. “I will continue making a contribution to help less privileged young South Africans to acquire the knowledge and skills to allow them to participate meaningfully in our economy.”
