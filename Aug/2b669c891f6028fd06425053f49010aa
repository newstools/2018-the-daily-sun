MORE than 30 families were evicted from Boitumelo squatter camp in Ficksburg on Wednesday. Some residents were preparing to go to work or school when police officers and municipal officials barged into their shacks and told them to hit the road. The residents said they occupied the land months ago and after a while, the area started to feel like home. Resident Moeketsana Tlou (36) said members of the community were devastated by the eviction. She said: “This place was our home, but now we have to live on the streets. “No one has ever hurt me the way the municipality did. “When we occupied the land, the municipality tried to evict us but we came to an agreement after we had a meeting. “But then they just showed up and told us to leave. “They demolished our shacks with a bulldozer and threw our belongings all over the bush. “I need to know why we were evicted like dogs. “These municipal officials will campaign for votes while they are pushing their corrupt agendas. “Residents are going to have to sleep outdoors because they have nowhere else to go. “Even though our shacks have been demolished, we are not going anywhere. “We will stay here until top government officials come to address us. “We demand the municipality meet us or give us another place to live.” Setsoto municipal spokeswoman Moroesi Gaba said: “The illegal occupants were given a notice of eviction. “The application is valid until a judge cancels the existing court order. “The residents were removed because they were illegal occupants who were breaking the law. They are not allowed to live there.”
