AFTER Daily Sun published a story about kids crossing a river to get to school on Monday, officials took action. The pupils from Lerutlwane Primary in Mosenthal Village and Matetenene High in Rankelenyane, near Rustenburg in North West, travel from Ikageng Village daily. The provincial community safety department promised that by Wednesday, buses would be available. When no buses arrived that day, parents blocked the roads. But yesterday morning, it was all joy and happiness as kids took their seats in a bus that took them to school, thanks to the People’s Paper. Community leader Thulani Bika said they’re happy the kids are no longer suffering. But he said the buses didn’t look roadworthy and the service provider wasn’t helpful. He and other leaders plan to meet department officials today to request more buses, as the schools need five each. The department has urged school transport operators to comply with the supplier requirements. Spokesman Rebaone Moeng said the department is dealing with a payment backlog of operators, who in some areas have stopped transporting pupils. “We are trying our best to address these. Our main challenge is operators who are non-compliant, causing a delay in payments.” Early this year, MEC Mpho Motlhabane asked operators to update their profiles to avoid late payments.
