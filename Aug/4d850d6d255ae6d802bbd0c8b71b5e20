SELLO Raphahlele (28) is desperately searching for his car. Sello, from Arcadia in Tshwane, bought a Toyota Etios to use as a taxi, and in May he hired a driver. Then after two weeks the driver disappeared. Sello said when he asked about the driver’s whereabouts, he was told the man had been kidnapped by metered taxi operators. He then went to the police station to open a case. “The driver’s phone was off and I thought he was really kidnapped,” said Sello. “I thought whoever kidnapped the driver would keep the car and let him go. “I was worried about him and I called his phone every day, but it was still off.” A week later, said Sello, he used another phone to call the driver – and he answered. “When the driver heard it was me, he hung up. “I went to the police, and when they called the driver, he answered. “He told the cops he would bring the car back, but he has not done so. I just want my car back. “I even went to the place where he said he lived, but no one there knew him,” said Sello. Sunnyside police spokesman Captain Daniel Mavimbela said a case of theft was opened and cops were investigating.
