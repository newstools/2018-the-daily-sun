WHEN Skeem Saam fans have long switched off their TVs and turned in for the night, popular actor Max Papo waits for his horror to return. Like the soapie’s fans, he too should be dozing off. But his peace is shattered by a midnight stalker’s phonecalls! Sometimes the caller asks him who he’s sleeping with before hanging up. On other nights she breathes heavily, not saying a word. Papo said every night was torture since a bitter ex started terrorising him and his partner with calls in the dead of night. Papo, who portrays the sugar daddy character Marothi in Skeem Saam, broke up with the woman in 2016 after a three-year relationship. The woman asked him to remain friends and he agreed, but that proved to be a big mistake. He cursed the day he met her. “She calls at night and in the early hours using different numbers. “She sent my partner a friendship request on Facebook, but she blocked her.” The woman accused him of dating teenagers. “She tells anyone who cares to listen I’m sleeping with a 17-year-old girl. “My daughter is 17! What kind of a dad would I be if I had a relationship with her peer.” She had also accused him of targeting young varsity girls. “Marothi, my character in Skeem Saam, was a sugar daddy,” he said. “I leave my work at work and, as a father, I have contempt for blessers and sugar daddies.” Even his mum was getting calls from the ex. Several attemptsto reach the woman proved fruitless. Max hasn’t reported the matter to police.
