KWAZULU Natal has become known for violent protests. Each time disgruntled residents embark on a protest, trucks are torched on the national roads. Disgruntled residents from Colenso went on a rampage closing R74 road between Colenso and Weenen with rocks. When cops attempted to open the road, residents stoned and shot at leaving their vehicles damaged during the incident. Speaking to Daily Sun, Cop spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the violent protesters threatened a security guard that was on duty at [Translation Lookaside Buffe] TLB Company along the R103 road and set the truck alight. “The group went on to hijack a truck which was then looted of its load while they used the truck to close off the roadway. When our officers responded they were met with gun fire and were forced to retaliate,” she said. Mbele said “One person was treated for a gunshot wound on the scene and later died in hospital. Colenso police are investigation a case of inquest, public violence & malicious damage to property.”
