 THE EFF in KZN has vowed to fight what it calls the unconstitutional rules at Inanda Seminary School outside Durban. The party protested outside the school on Friday after two pupils were expelled on 21 July. The grade 8 and 9 schoolgirls were expelled after allegedly being caught kissing on the premises. EFF leader Vusi Khoza said the school lived in ancient times. “We as the EFF believe this school is doing things backwards. We live in a new South Africa, which fully supports homosexuality. “What this school is doing is displaying signs of homophobia, which we find very unconstitutional.” He said the school’s decision to expel the girls violated their constitutional rights. He said they would take up the matter with the relevant authorities. “We cannot stand schools doing as they please, while we are guided by the Constitution. We are going to make sure these pupils’ dignity is restored,” said Khoza. A parent of one of the expelled pupils said it warmed her heart that the EFF was standing up against what the school did. “I didn’t know that they were going to protest but am happy that they did. “What the school did to our kids was not right.” She said she didn’t wish her daughter’s fate on others. The school was not available for comment.
