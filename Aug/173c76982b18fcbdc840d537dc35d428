Reality TV star, Tebogo PinkyGirl Mekgwe is set to take her career to the next level. The Being Bonang breakout star has been open about wanting to break into the entertainment industry after her popularity rose just from appearing on the show. Season two of the show saw her picking up the pace by signing up with OrchardOn25, a public relations company run by Bonang Matheba’s former manager, Jay Badza. Pinky says she has plans of going into the fashion and beauty industry and she is already making those moves. The 30-year-old from Pretoria has scored herself a modeling deal with iconic South African design house, Khosi Nkosi. Fans of the show first saw her modelling the clothes on the reality show before the final shots were released online. The deal sees Pinky modelling a number of designs which have been named after her including the Tebogo stretch Seshweshwe dress and the Tebogo jumpsuit. Khosi Nkosi has become synonymous with only using celebrity faces as the brand’s official models.
