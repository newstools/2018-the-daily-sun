The streets of Diepkloof were a flurry of activity yesterday as fans and local celebrities paid homage to the late rap icon, Linda ‘Pro Kid’ Mkhize. Slaghuis Studio in Diepkloof became a sort of memorial service when hundreds of people gathered to honour the legacy of Pro Kid. Pro died last week Wednesday after he suffered a “severe seizure” while visiting a friend in the JHB CBD. Among those gathered at Slaghuis were Tbo Touch, Gigi LaMayne, and Solo. Not only were Pro’s songs chanted all afternoon long, a mural of his face was also painted to commemorate his legacy. Check out the pics and videos below:
