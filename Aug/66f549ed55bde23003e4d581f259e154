JUSTICE Mbonane has dedicated his life to helping blind people improve their lives. The 33-year-old, who is originally from Newcastle in KZN, is a social worker at the Joburg Society for the Blind in Regent’s Park. He told Daily Sun that part of his job was to make sure resident students’ room were kept clean and neat. Justice, who is partially blind himself, said: “I also help students to behave well.” He said another one of his duties was to help elderly blind people exercise on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. He teaches ndlamu dancing through the society’s arts and culture programme. Justice said he became blind in 2011 after an acid explosion at work. “I was offloading acid tanks when one exploded and acid fell on my face and hands. “Two months after the accident, doctors found that the acid had not been thoroughly cleaned away, leading to my left eye rotting,” he said. Justice said he had undergone 27 operations to the right eye and seven to the left. “The doctors said they had reached the maximum stage of treatment and the only thing they could do was to control the pressure in the right eye so that I don’t lose my vision completely.” Justice said a challenge faced by blind people was that tools they needed such as walking sticks, recording devices and voice recognition software were expensive. He appealed to motorists not to hoot at blind people as it broke their concentration. “We cannot see and therefore we rely a great deal on our sense of hearing,” he said.
