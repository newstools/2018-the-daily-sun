SOUTH Africa senior women’s coach Desiree Ellis has revealed that they are in a process of going the Orlando Pirates way to improve Banyana Banyana’s goal scoring woes. Not so long ago the Buccaneers surprised many when they revealed that they had appointed Stephane Adam as a specialist coach for finishing. And Banyana coach Ellis, who hinted a few months ago that they were considering roping in the likes of Phil Masinga to help the girls improve in front of goal, said they have something coming up. “Our biggest challenge, I have reiterated over and over, is finishing. “We are not just considering the option of getting people who will help our strikers. There has been lot of developments behind the scenes,” said Ellis. Banyana have been disappointing when it comes to World tournaments. It’s either they don’t qualify or they are booted out in the first round of the competition without even scoring. In 2016 Banyana were knocked out in the group stages in the Olympics without a win and couldn’t score even a single goal in three matches. In January this year, they failed another tough test against Sweden when they couldn’t get past the Swedes’ defence and were thumped 3-0 in a friendly match. In March they went to the Cyprus Women’s Cup, played four games, won one and scored only two goals. “Everyone needs to take part – it’s not for strikers only. We will leave no stone unturned to ensure we qualify for the 2019 Fifa Women’s World Cup,” said Ellis. Banyana are currently in camp preparing for the 2018 Cosafa Women’s Championship to be played in Mzansi at the end of August. Their next stop is Ghana where they will begin their quest of qualifying for World Cup in the Women’s Afcon which will take place from 12 November to 1 December in Ghana. The top three teams qualify for the World Cup.
