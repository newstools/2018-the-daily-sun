CORRECTIONAL services in the Free State held a session on moral regeneration at Grootvlei Prison Hall in Bloemfontein on Wednesday. The event was attended by officials and offenders. They spoke about issues such as organisational culture, violence against women and children and social unity. Pastors were also at the event. Free State and Northern Cape regional commissioner Subashin Moodley said: “The department of correctional services has decided to focus on moral regeneration to rebuild the moral fibre of society. “What we have seen here is an event that has been rolled out throughout the country. “The national office, made up of chaplains and officials from the department, are visiting all regions and will be talking to offenders. “They are asking what we are doing to rebuild moral fibre because it starts with us. It’s easy to blame society or the government but we individually make up society. Let us review our role, the way we think and review our code of conduct. “We have to function as responsible citizens.” Neo Chaka of the Moral Regeneration Movement was at the event. Chaka said: “We established the organisation in 2012 in response to an earlier call made by Nelson Mandela. Madiba raised the issue of rape, murder and the abuse of women, which we are talking about on a bigger scale today. “The programme of moral regeneration is to regenerate our moral fibre and take us back to when morals, ethics and values were practised by every South African.”
