LEGENDARY soccer player Brian “Spiderman” Baloyi saved countless goals in his heyday. And now the former Amakhosi and Bafana Bafana goalkeeper is scoring big for Mzansi’s poor black kids. Brian and his wife Phungi officially launched the Brian Baloyi Family Foundation in Alexandra, north of Joburg yesterday, the township where Baloyi was born. The foundation aims to undertake a wide range of initiatives and has already embarked on a number of programmes in sport, education and health. Brian said the idea to start a foundation was inspired by his wife, after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007. He said while he was playing for Kaizer Chiefs they did a lot of charity work, and that exposed him to many children suffering from cancer. He said it broke his heart each time he was told that a child they had visited had passed on. “But when it hits home, you start doing your own research,” said Brian. Although the foundation was initiated in 2009, Brian said it was a work in progress and that they had to dissolve the boards twice, while both him and Phungi struggled to make time because of their busy schedules. “I’m a perfectionist and that’s one of the things that has been holding the project back. I also wanted to bring it home because that’s where my humble beginnings started,” he said. Brian said the foundation would work to empower black children from disadvantaged communities by providing them with knowledge and opportunities. This would include provision of early childhood development, as well as basic football coaching skills including technical training and goal keeper training. “The country does not provide goal- keeper training for younger footballers. “If this doesn’t change, we will have a big problem, as we have with strikers,” said Baloyi. The foundation will also provide academic support including bursary assistance and hosting of career expos. They will also focus on raising cancer awareness by promoting prevention.
