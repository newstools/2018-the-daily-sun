AN aunt was cornered outside court for her alleged involvement in her niece’s murder! But Noluthando Bandezi (36) said she had nothing to do with Sinoyolo Mgaga’s murder. The body of 18-year-old Sinyolo was found in a grazing veld in October last year. Her head and body parts were missing and were later recovered by cops on a river bank. Olwethu Mbalwa (30) was arrested for allegedly killing her. During his bail application at the Mbizana Magistrates Court on Monday, Olwethu said he wanted bail so he could find a private lawyer. Outside court, community members accused Noluthando of killing her niece for money. But she denied any involvement in the murder. “I was chased out of my home in October. I don’t know anything about the murder because I wasn’t there that night. “I left KwaNikhwe Village because I was scared the community would harm me,” she said. KwaNikhwe herdman Vusumzi Tyeba said they wanted to tell Noluthando what they had decided about her home. “The community doesn’t want any unoccupied houses. She has a choice to come back, have someone else stay there or take her things so we can demolish the house,” he said. Her family was adamant they wanted nothing to do with her. Ngele Bandezi, who is Noluthando’s cousin, said he would be homeless if he helped her. “We don’t trust her because we still think she’s involved in Sinoyolo’s killing. She’s married, so she must go to her in-laws,” he said. The case will resume today.
