THEIR hands might have been dirtied by their trade but they are proud of earning clean money. These men from Thaba Nchu can be found next to the busy N8 between Botshabelo and Bloemfontein, where they sell their handiwork to tourists. The group of hustlers tan animal skins and also make wooden sculptures. They use the leather to make belts, shoes, sandals, bags and purses. Andrew Koloane (57) said: “I have a lot of experience in hide tanning, as well as crafting leather products. “I teach others tanning and how to make wooden sculptures. I was taught by John Seekoei, who knew all the tricks of this trade. “I’m grateful to him,” Andrew said. Moeketsi Phalatsane (43) specialises in decoration, while Malefetsane Ntseng (46) has mastered making mosaics and wood sculpting. The men say teamwork led to their success. Andrew said: “I have survived on this for many years and managed to provide for my family. This craft is easy if you are dedicated. My work is in my blood.” The men also market their products at museums, exhibitions and flea markets.
