THE spot next to the river is well known as a place where all kinds of people come to perform rituals. On Monday night, residents nearby saw a ball of fire as flames rose into the dark next to the Blesbok river. And the next morning horror greeted the day as another visitor to the river stumbled upon a burnt human sacrifice! Not far from the remains of the man were a live chicken, two eggs put in a small hole, two R10 notes, a doll and sangoma clothes. Residents said it looked as if the man had been necklaced. His body was burned and his shoes and trousers were lying nearby. Residents of Etwatwa, Daveyton in Ekurhuleni told the People’s Paper strange things happened next to the river. “People gather there at night. “We often don’t know what they do. Today a body has been found,” said a resident. “This makes us all scared. Strange things happen around us and we may end up being victims one day,” said residents. Gina Mohlala, who made the gruesome discovery, said she had gone to get water to take to her church. She screamed and went to the nearby house to get help. “The man had been killed in a cruel way and I was traumatised by the sight. I’ll never go back there again.” Captain Johannes Ramphora of Springs cop shop confirmed the murder. He said cops were looking for the relatives of the man. “Anyone who might have a missing relative or has information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects is asked to contact 08600 10111 or visit the Springs Police Station,” he said.
