A DARK cloud is hovering over Popular maskandi singer, Mlethwa Majola. First his house burned to ashes in June, with not much that he salvage . . . Then he was beset with a mystery illness, vomiting blood uncontrollably! He told Daily Sun the source of his misfortune was the jealousy that is ruining maskandi music. Speaking via phone from his home in Booysens, Joburg Mlethwa told the People’s Paper: “All of this could be as a result of a curse. “I vomited blood for three consecutive days and it still comes back time and again,” he said The maskandi singer said he saw the faces of his fellow maskandi singers Mjikijelwa Ngubane, who died in May this year, Mtshengiseni Gcwensa who died in 2015 and Khulekani Mseleku aka Mgqumeni, who passed on in 2009, in a dream and fears he could be the next to die. The singer spent a week at South Rand Hospital in Joburg last month. He said at the hospital the doctors said they couldn’t see anything wrong with him despite his saliva containing blood. Mlethwa, who has lost so much weight and is weak and still in bed, has since suspended the release of his eighth album which was due to be hit the airwaves in October. He says he would be consulting izangoma and prophets when he recovers his strength. He said the jealousy that plagued the industry caused Maskandi musicians to hate each other and that he was scared of the dark cloud following him. He said during the fire in June he lost his clothes, blankets, bags, shoes, furniture, music system, 200 new CD for his songs Siyasebenza, and two lead guitars. He last performed at Hillbrow in May before everything went wrong. “I’m in pain and stressed,” said the sobbing Mthethwa over the phone. Mlethwa’s is known for songs such as Nom’ Yithi which won him the South African Traditional Music Award in the category Best Newcomer in 2013 and Best DVD in 2014.
