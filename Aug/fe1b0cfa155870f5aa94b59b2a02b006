Controversial singer, dancer and nurse, Skolopad is allegedly recovering in hospital after she took one too many anti-anxiety pills. TshisaLive is reporting that after having a “heated” argument with a colleague, Skolopad took several anti-anxiety pills because she wanted to "rest for a long time”. According to the report, things have not been going “smoothly” for Skolopad, who has been trying to advance her nursing career. "When I got home, I took some pills. Mostly anti-anxiety pills but pills that I had. It's pills I usually take when I am angry and need to calm down, so I took a couple of them. I feel like I need to rest for a long time... even if it's forever. Yes. I have wanted to die many times before. I have attempted to jump off the hospital roof top. I just didn't make it. This time I just wanted to rest,” she told the publication. She also said that although she has thought of taking her life in the past, she was not trying to commit suicide this time around, she just wanted to rest. All of this was set of by some drama between her and a fellow matron. “I was really, really hurt. I cried a lot in their presence but they told me to rather go back to the ward and work or go home so I could calm down. I asked them to resign because I feel like nothing I ever ask for at work is ever approved. I have asked for so many things, things that really matter and have merit where my job is concerned but I am constantly shot down or made empty promises. What have I done wrong as a nurse? Nothing,” she said. Skolopad is allegedly seeking professional help.
