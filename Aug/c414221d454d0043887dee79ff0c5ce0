FORMER North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo might lose his state benefits. This comes after the DA in North West wrote a letter to the public protector on Thursday. The party said it asked the public protector to investigate allegations that Mahumapelo is still enjoying government benefits. Mahumapelo took early retirement in May after coming under mounting pressure to resign. The DA said it would also write to North West provincial legislature speaker Susanna Dantjie to probe why privileges reserved for a sitting premier were being afforded to Mahumaphelo. North West DA leader Joe McGluwa said the outcome of the investigation must be tabled in the legislature. “Mahumapelo is no longer entitled to the use of official vehicles or VIP protection. Those benefits should have been withdrawn the day he resigned,” said McGluwa. “The people’s money should not be used to protect a man who actively collapsed the province.” Professor Job Mokgoro, Mahumapelo’s replacement, said the former premier’s security assistance had been authorised by the ministry of police. He said Mahumapelo was allowed state security for up to three months. Reneilwe Serero, Police Minister Bheki Cele’s spokesman, said Mahumapelo followed due process to use state VIP services.
