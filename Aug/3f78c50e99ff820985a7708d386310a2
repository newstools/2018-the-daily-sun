THE funeral of three brothers on Saturday in Manyii, Makhado, Limpopo was a very sad occasion. Last week, Tshilidzi (7), Thabo (6) and Olugaho Madou (2) were hacked to death by their father, Samuel Madou (43). Mourners included a delegation from the Venda royal family, Vhembe mayor Florence Radzilani, Makhado mayor Mildred Sinyosi, ANC leaders and pupils and teachers from Sikhwivhilu Primary School, where two of the boys were pupils. Speakers called for an end to abuse of women and children. Radzilani called on residents to act quickly if they noticed inunusual behaviour in families. “Don’t take these signs for granted. Don’t ignore them but seek professional help,” she said. Senior traditional leader Vele Kutama read a statement from Venda king Toni Mphephu Ramabulana. The king, who gave financial assistance for the burial, said the tragedy of the children’s deaths affected all of the Venda nation. He said he was heartbroken. “We have lost leaders of tomorrow. “We are making a call to the whole nation for men to stop this evil abuse. “Seek help if there are problems. Our nation is sick and tired of domestic violence,” he said. Last Monday, the boys’ father appeared in Dzanani Magistrates Court after his arrest. He is being charged with three counts of murder. Madou remains in custody after his case was postponed to 17 September for investigation and mental observation.
