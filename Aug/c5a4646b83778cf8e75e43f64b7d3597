She sings in harmony with the lead, sometimes sings alone and other times sings counter melodies. Her ability to sing by ear is one of the desirable skills that has led to Nokwazi being one of the most sought after session singers in the studio. She has also worked with touring groups and has been credited about 10 times as the featured singer by DJs and singers. Nokwazi has worked with Uhuru, Heavy K, DJ Clap and Pex Africa. She’s travelled with Thandiswa Mazwai to Germany, Spain, England, New York and France. People may remember Nokwazi from her days of backing for legendary musicians such as Rebecca Malope, Vuyo Mokoena, Brenda Fassie and Chicco Twala. And now the singer from Imbali, Pietermaritzburg, in the KZN Midlands has shattered one of the barriers of back-up singers. She has recorded her own album, Umuntu whichwill be released next month. “The album will display my vocal ability which I have worked on for 12 years as a backing vocalist and session singer.” She said the album comes after fans and music friends encouraged her to release it. “But after my mother Thandiwe Dladla made the suggestion, I knew I had to do it.” She said her mother phoned her and said: “So u recorda, nini?” Her house single, Uyezwa, featuring Ntsika from The Soil is already available on all social media platforms. Other tracks to look forward to are Umuntu and Ngeke Balunge. Nokwazi said taking the supporting role as a backup singer was satisfying. “It taught me to listen and understand the songs and that has helped me as a lead singer.” She said Chicco helped her launch her acting career with roles in some of his movies. She has been on several hit tracks tracks such as Sweetie, Ingoma and Wamuhle. She has kept her sound in traditional, house, ballad, tribal and maskandi music. When she’s not busy, she likes watching musical theatre and also enjoys being part of it. “Theatre is part of my vocal training,” said the mother of two.
