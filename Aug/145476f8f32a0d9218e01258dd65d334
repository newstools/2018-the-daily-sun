PUPILS from various schools on Friday celebrated National Day against Child Labour in Wesselsbron, Free State. The South African Social Security Agency, South African Police Service, Home Affairs and the department of correctional services were part of the event. Pupils sang, performed drama pieces and recited speeches. Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant said: “Child labour involves children being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to serious hazards and illnesses, or left to defend themselves on the streets of large cities.” She said work that deprived kids of their childhood, potential, dignity and was harmful to their physical and mental development must be targeted and eliminated. “Chores that interfere with a child’s education, forcing them to leave school prematurely, should have no place in society. “We want children to learn so they can have a prosperous future,” she said. Oliphant said the Free State had the largest number of underage workers. “Some were found at two farms in Wesselsbron. “Labour inspectors have since opened criminal cases against these farms for breaking the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, which prohibits children from working.” She said the ANC had crafted a legal framework to deal with child labour. Mohlomi Mphosi (16) from Kheleng Secondary School said: “We want to be given a chance to go to school because education is the key to success. There are many ways to deal with child labour and teaching kids about their rights is one of them. Our duty as young people is to study.”
