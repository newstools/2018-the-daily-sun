WHEN a man claiming to be a prophet said he had caught thugs in his home, residents wanted to kill them. However, they became suspicious after the prophet fled with the men. Daily Sun published an article about the incident last week. The People’s Paper last Friday reported that residents believed the break-in was staged. But the prophet, who goes by the name of Dr Kato, approached the SunTeam and claimed he was not faking anything and that reason he fled was because he didn’t want the criminals to be killed in his yard. He claimed many of his clients were angry with him and some had even stopped using his services because he had saved the men’s lives. “I rescued the thugs for a reason,” claimed Dr Kato. “My ancestors don’t allow the spilling of human blood. “When I realised the residents were out to kill the thugs, I had to get them away.” He claimed if the thugs had been killed because of him, his ancestors would have turned away from him. “Healing is what I know and I would have lost my gift,” he claimed. Dr Kato showed the SunTeam a special mixture he allegedly uses to catch thugs. “I use a lock and an egg. I mix them with a special muthi and it never fails,” he claimed. Dr Kato claimed many thugs had been caught with his muthi but he wouldn’t allow them to be hurt. “After the incident, my clients told me my muthi has always protected them,” he alleged. “When they asked why I had hired actors to pretend to be thugs, I told them it was not true,” he claimed. “Our nation has been taken for a ride by other fake people but I’m not a fake prophet.”
