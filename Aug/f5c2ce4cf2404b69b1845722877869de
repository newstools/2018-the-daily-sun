FIFTY-EIGHT families were left homeless after a fire destroyed their shacks. The incident happened at Ziphunzana squatter camp in East London on Wednesday. Although firefighters were called, the wind was very strong, making it difficult for them to kill the blaze. Community leader Khangelani Mthotywa told Daily Sun the fire did not only destroy their homes, but lives too. “The fire started at about 1pm. The owner of the shack where it started was not at home. We do not know the cause, because the shack was locked,” said Mthotywa. “Everything in our shacks has been burnt. Now we have to start afresh to build our shacks, but our councillor, Clara Yekiso-Morolong, is working hard to help us.” Yekiso-Morolong told the People’s Paper that Buffalo City Municipality was working with Sassa to help affected residents with food, while Home Affairs was helping with IDs and the disaster management team offered blankets. “Donations are welcome and should be sent through,” she said. “Residents who do not have a place to stay have been taken to the local hall, while others chose to stay with relatives.” Bathandwa Diamon, a spokeswoman for the municipality, said they suspected that illegal electricity connections might have caused the fire.
