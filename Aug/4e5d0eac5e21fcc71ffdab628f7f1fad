IT’S been two months since Shadrack Maluleke (29) left home! His older brother, Lucky Maluleke (34) has been worried about him since his disappearance on 28 May. Lucky said Shadrack had been living with him in his flat in Pretoria West since October. He said it wasn’t the first time his brother had gone missing. He disappeared in 2016 but was found a week later at their home in Malamulele, Limpopo. “It’s sad to lose someone close to you. His absence has caused us a lot of pain,” he said. Lucky said he went home to look for him but he was not there. He said Lucky didn’t have friends in the area and he took all his belongings when he left. “We’re stressed about his whereabouts and the worst part is that his phone is not working.” Police spokeswoman Constable Sibongile Vuma said Shadrack was last seen at the Little Manhattan building. He was wearing a navy blue leather jacket with a sky blue T-shirt, khaki trousers, black leather shoes with a white hat and brown sunglasses. He’s Tsonga-speaking but can also speak Sotho, Zulu and English. Vuma said a missing person’s case was opened at the Pretoria West cop shop. Anyone who’s seen Shadrack is asked to contact Constable Daphney Mugwedi at 012 386 4163 or 072 412 2585 or Lucky on 076 177 0447.
