WHILE Mathapelo Mogorosi’s coffin was being lowered into her grave, cops were searching for the man they believe is responsible for her death. The 33-year-old died after complaining of flu. Reports say the doctor she consulted before she died allegedly gave her the wrong medication! It is believed that he is a fake doctor. The co-founder of the Consistent Cultural Group in Tshing near Ventersdorp, North West was buried on Saturday. Police are looking for the man who they believe is posing as a medical doctor. Residents said he has surgeries in Ventersdorp, Coligny, Klerksdorp and Lichtenburg and he uses different names. Mathapelo’s mum, Maria (50), said her daughter was healthy and could walk to work and to the doctor. But the night she died last week, she called the doctor who came to pick her up. “Later that night, he put her in a wheelchair and left her at a hospital ward without saying a word,” said Maria. Maria added that the “doctor” took her to the hospital and pointed out her daughter’s ward. “He then turned away, saying he left his stethoscope in the car, and never came back.” Maria said shocked nurses confirmed that Mathapelo was dead and handed the matter over to the cops. Maria found out then that she was also pregnant. At her funeral speakers described her as humble and a striking beauty. She left behind her parents, a sister and two kids. North West police spokeswoman Sergeant Kelebogile Moleko confirmed that a case of murder was opened for investigation. “Ventersdorp police searched for the suspect at his place and workplace without success. “He is alleged to be a fake doctor from the DRC,” said Moleko.
