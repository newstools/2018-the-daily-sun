THE deafening screams of an anguished family pierced the air as they stared down at the murdered boy. Residents heard the terrible wailing and rushed to the scene. Finding the man accused of the killing among them, they decided that justice was to be brutal, swift and merciless. Soon after the rage had set in on Monday, Sthembiso Mthembu (30), from Clermont in eThekwini, was dead, beaten and burnt in a pile of ash and dirt. A little way off lay his ex-girlfriend’s son, little Kwanele Makabo (5), who had been strangled. Kwanele’s family say Sthembiso deserved to be burned to death. Kwanele’s gogo, Sibongile Makabo (58), told Daily Sun that they had sent the little boy to a local tuckshop to buy bread when Sthembiso snatched him. “He called Kwanele’s mum and told her he was going to kill himself and Kwanele because he wanted her to feel pain for dumping him in April,” she said. Sibongile said the child never returned home and Sthembiso’s phone went straight to voicemail when they tried to call him back. “We reported the matter to the cops and later called Sthembiso’s brothers, who said he had just arrived home,” she said. “They promised they would bring him to us the next day to tell us where he had taken my grandson.” She said when they arrived the following day, Sthembiso led them to a bush where the boy’s body was found. That’s when the residents of Tshelimnyama stepped in. “They beat Sthembiso and burned him alive. We are happy he also died painfully,” said the gogo. She said her daughter Rethabile (28) had been in a relationship with Stembiso since 2014, but had left him because he was abusive. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed two counts of murder were being investigated by the Mariannhill cops. “A five-year-old was found in the bush with strangulation marks around his neck. A short while later, a 30-year-old was certified dead on the scene,” he said.
