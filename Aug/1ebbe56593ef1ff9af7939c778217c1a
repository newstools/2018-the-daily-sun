AS the #TotalShutdown marches got underway across the country,
the ANCWL also held their own march to Luthuli House in Joburg. The marches were against women abuse. #TotalShutDown marches organisers made it clear that men are
not welcomed at their marches. The ANCWL march was also joined by faith-based
organisations, civil society and other members of society. The ANCWL recently launched a Name and Shame campaign, as a
way of building momentum for the march. According to the ANCWL the aim is to shift the focus from
survivors of gender-based violence, and direct it towards the wrongdoers. The ANCWLâ€™s campaign published pictures of men who had been
found guilty of abuse.
