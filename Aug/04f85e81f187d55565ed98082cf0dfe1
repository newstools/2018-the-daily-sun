THE AbaThembu royal family wants women to be screened for cancer. King Azenathi Dalindyebo made the plea on Saturday at the funeral of Wendy Mgudlwa, the wife of Border Alliance Taxi Association deputy chairman Jingiso Mgudlwa. Jingiso is also the brother of a chief in Qumanco. Wendy died of lung cancer at the age of 41. “We would like the Thembu people to take cancer seriously. “One of our own was killed by this disease, so we want to raise awareness about it,” said the king. “It’s up to us to educate the nation about cancer. “We urge everyone, especially the elderly, to be screened regularly for cancer. “We will hold imbizos with chiefs and raise awareness on public platforms.” Eastern Cape Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana urged women to adopt the values of anti-apartheid activist Albertina Sisulu. “Let us follow in the footsteps of Albertina Sisulu and women like her because that is what mama Wendy did. “She had leadership skills and always took charge. “She was a good example for all of us,” said Tikane. The MEC said women deserved to receive as much recognition as men. “Women struggle to get into powerful positions and have to work extra hard to be leaders. “Let’s fight inequality at work and make our voices heard. “If we want society to change, we need to give women leadership positions.”
