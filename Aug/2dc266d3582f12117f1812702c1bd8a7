“WE DID not burn any buses. We were just protesting and the buses caught fire. It was just a coincidence.” These were the words of an Eldorado Park resident who spoke to the SunTeam yesterday. While protesters were demonstrating near a police station in the kasi south of Joburg, eight Metrobus vehicles were burned. The buses were parked just behind the local police station. Some residents pointed fingers at the protesters, who told the People’s Paper they were innocent. “Our protest was peaceful. “We only blocked the roads with rocks. “We did not even burn as much as a piece of paper,” said resident Lucas Smith. Metrobus spokesman Goodwill Shivuri told Daily Sun  that they did not know what had started the fire. “We heard about the protest, but we do not know if it had anything to do with the fire,” he said. He said they suspected that the fire was started by someone who threw a cigarette or burning matchstick onto the grass. “We do not have the facts at the moment, but an investigation will reveal all,” he said. He said damage was estimated to be about R1.5 million. A security guard who works at the depot behind the police station said he was sitting near the entrance when the fire started. “I saw smoke and I made my way towards the buses, but I could not see anything because the fire spread very quickly,” the guard said. He said firefighters were called in, but the damage had already been done by the time they arrived. A spokesman for Joburg Emergency Management Services, Robert Mulaudzi, confirmed the incident.
