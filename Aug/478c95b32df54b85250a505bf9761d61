A TEENAGE boy will appear in the Elliotdale Magistrates Court, Eastern Cape today for allegedly killing his dad. The 17-year-old reportedly stabbed his 35-year-old dad to death over a saddle. The teen was apparently not happy that his dad put a saddle in his room and attacked him. The incident happened at Cweve Village in Elliotdale on Wednesday. Police spokesman Captain Jackson Manatha said: “The suspect did not like what was done by his father, and asked why he put the saddle in his room. He then stabbed him in the upper body. “The injured father was rushed to Madwaleni Hospital, where he died. The suspect was arrested and charged with murder. “He was later placed in the custody of his relatives because he is a minor.”
