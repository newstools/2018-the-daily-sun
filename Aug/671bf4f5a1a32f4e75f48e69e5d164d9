LIVING with a disability does not mean you cannot make your dreams come true. Inathi Mncinci (25), an intern doctor from Mthatha, Eastern Cape, is proof of this. She was involved in a car accident in 2005, which permanently damaged her right leg. Her twin sister and brother were killed in the accident. Although she cannot bend her leg, she has fulfilled her dream of becoming a doctor. “I had multiple surgeries. I have a fracture on my right knee and right arm,” she said. “My family is not well-off, but they tried to get me the best medical care. In 2010, I visited Bedford Hospital and they aligned my leg. They also found my knee no longer has the fluid that allows me to bend it,” she said. Inathi said she wanted to study medicine to help other people living with disabilities. She studied at Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha and now works in Pietermaritzburg. “When I was in hospital, I realised I wanted to be a good doctor because I know the pain patients are feeling. “I am who I am because of what happened, and I can’t imagine my life turning out another way. Maybe I wouldn’t be here if the accident never happened. “People living with disabilities need to know that nothing is impossible.”
