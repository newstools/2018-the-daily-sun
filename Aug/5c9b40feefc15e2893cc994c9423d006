WHEN you walk past Moalene Tshoeu’s restaurant, you’d think it’s always been there. The 52-year-old told Daily Sun his kasi restaurant, Katleho’s Kitchen, had humble beginnings. In the early days when Moalene was just starting out, he sold his delicious food door to door from a wheelbarrow. But now he no longer has to slog through the kasi to find customers. They now come to him. When the SunTeam arrived at his restaurant, customers were being served pap and meat, chips with fat cakes and polony, and others bought braaied chicken feet and heads. Katleho’s Kitchen is situated on a busy main road in Pieter Swarts kasi in Mangaung. He said: “I started selling sheep and cattle bones using a wheelbarrow and going door to door. “I realised people in my area needed a place nearby where they could buy food. Many people had to take taxis to town to buy food. “I work with my daughter and wife and we’re doing well at this moment.” Moalene’s wife Dimakatso (49) is responsible for making pap, fat cakes and salads. Their daughter Maklaas (32) helps her dad braai the meat. The restaurant operates from 7.30am and closes at about 9pm. Dimakatso said: “We serve pap with spinach, wors and salads for just R20 a plate. “We’re loved and supported by the residents, who’re always happy with our service.” Maklaas said the braaied chicken feet and heads cost R2 each. The family said they would love to see their business grow so they could employ more people. “We’ll be selling prepaid electricity and airtime soon,” said Moalene.
