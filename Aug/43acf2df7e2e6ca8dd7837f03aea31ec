THE families of three women who allegedly stripped a girl naked and took a video of her have been chased out of the kasi. According to the victim, the three women from Mdantsane, Port Elizabeth called her while she was on her way to college last Monday. They accused the 21-year-old girl of sleeping with one of their boyfriends. “I denied it but they didn’t listen. They started stripping off my clothes and swearing at me,” she told Daily Sun. She told the People’s Paper that she tried to run away, but they chased her. “I hid at my friend’s house, but they followed me. “They started shooting a video in which I was naked,” said the victim. In the 30-second video which the SunTeam saw, the three women can be heard forcing the victim to walk down the street naked. The victim opened a case immediately after the incident. She said she heard from one of her friends that the video had gone viral on social media. “I asked one of my friends to send it to me, but I could not finish watching it. “Those women have destroyed my dignity and put me at risk of being raped because my naked body is now all over social media.” Community leader Vuyisani Mancapa said the residents decided to evict the families of the three women because their parents did nothing to prevent the incident. “We told them that they are no longer welcome in our community. “We have kids and do not want them to end up in the same predicament,” he said. Police spokesman Mluleki Mbi told the People’s Paper: “A case of crimen injuria was opened but no arrests have been made.”
