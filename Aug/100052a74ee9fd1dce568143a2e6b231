WHAT was supposed to be a relaxing hunting trip turned into a nightmare when three men came across a body. The drama unfolded on Friday when Thapelo Maoko (24), Mojalefa Malapane (18) and Sadiso Mohlala (21) from Zoeknog, outside Acornhoek, Mpumalanga went bird hunting. The men knew something was wrong when their dogs started barking uncontrollably. “We ran to the dogs to find out why they were barking. “We noticed they were barking at a baboon that was climbing up a tree. “But when we got to the tree, the baboon had vanished,” said Thapelo. He said the dogs kept barking and sniffing around the tree. When the men had a closer look, they saw a corpse near the tree. “We rushed home to inform members of the community, who called the cops,” said Thapelo. Police spokeswoman Captain Mpho Nonyane said villagers led them to the body. “The corpse was wearing a pink skirt and a shirt with red, blue and white stripes,” she said. Nonyane said the corpse had not been identified and will be kept at a government mortuary until the family comes forward. An inquest docket has been opened. Anyone with information can call Detective-Warrant Officer Masilo Modiba on 078 6601 180 or 013 795 8033.
