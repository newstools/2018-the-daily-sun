24-year-old Preshalin Naidoo, the man who was convicted for the deaths of former Top Billing presenter, Simba Mhere and his friend, Kady-Shay O’Bryan will appear at the Johannesburg High Court today on a bail application today. This after Preshalin was sentenced to 10 years in prison for culpable homicide in June this year following a three-year court inquiry into the deaths of the two friends. Preshalin has since applied for bail pending his appeal and he will today receive judgement on that application. The 24-year-old was driving the car that caused the crash that ultimately killed Simba and his friend on 31 January 2015. TEN YEARS IN JAIL FOR SIMBA MHERE’S KILLER!
