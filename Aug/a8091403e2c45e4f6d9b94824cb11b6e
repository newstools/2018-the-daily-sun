SAMSON Nkosi (70) and his wife Sarah Manganyi (77) are lucky to be alive. The couple from Moloto Village in Mpumalanga were fast asleep when their shack started burning in the middle of the night on Saturday. Their tenant, Abednigo Hlungwani (31), saved them from the flames. Samson said Abednigo knocked on the door and woke them up. He told Daily Sun when he opened his eyes, he saw light and smoke in their bedroom. They don’t know what caused the fire but the flames burnt everything they had. They are left only with what they were wearing. “I woke my wife while Abednigo kicked the door open. He pulled us outside. We tried to put out the flames but it was as if we were fuelling it. When the fire brigade arrived, everything had already burned down. “We could not salvage a thing.” Gogo Sarah said if it weren’t for their tenant, they would have been burned to death. She thanks the Almighty for allowing him to arrive on time. “I am still shocked. We did not hear anything as we were asleep. “We ask kind people to help us start our lives over. We have nothing left.” Abednigo told the SunTeam he realised the shack was burning as he entered the gate. “I saw thick smoke and knew they were sleeping. I screamed and knocked but they didn’t answer. “I kicked the door open and dragged both out. “I called for help and we tried to stop the flames but there were too many.” Councillor Lovers Mahlangu called municipal officials to see the couple’s situation and said everything would be processed quickly to get them help. Sergeant Zimkhona Mahlangu said no case has been reported or registered on the police system.
