NOT all residents of Dabe near Pinetown in KZN have cars, but the giant potholes in the area are a nightmare for everyone. Bongumusa Mathunjwa (45) said Nkazimulo Road was the most damaged in the area. He said RDPs in the area were built in 1999 and they moved into the houses in 2000. “The roads were built during that period. After that, there hasn’t been any development. Councillors have been changed, but there is no difference,” he said. Bongumusa said the residents filled some of the potholes with sand, but that was temporary as the sand was often washed away by rain. Another resident, Thabani Mchunu (55), said: “My car has been badly damaged by the potholes. We want this problem sorted out before it gets worse.” The municipality’s spokesman, Mandla Nsele, said a team would attend to the potholes soon.
