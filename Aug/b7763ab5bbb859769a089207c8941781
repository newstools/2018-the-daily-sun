It seems as though both Taraji P. Henson and Halle Berry’s names have been removed from the 2018 International Woman In Media Conference line-up. Both of their names have now disappeared from the conference’s official website and the Twitter account of the organisers, 21st Century Group. The media and asset management company, as well as Bonang’s management at Celebrity Services Africa has declined offers to comment from the media. 21st Century Group have claimed to be working on a statement to be released on Monday. TARAJI DENIES ALL KNOWLEDGE OF MZANSI APPEARANCE! The speakers that now remain, according to the website, include Amanda du-Pont, Thabile Ngwato, Claire Mawisa, Salamina Mosese, Connie Ferguson, Bonang Matheba, Nomzamo Mbatha and Ashanti.
