EFF LEADER Julius Malema said his party is not apologetic
about its decision to remove Athol Trollip as Mayor of Nelson Mandela Metro. He said this "must be understood as a serious
opposition to the white arrogance of the white dominated DA". "Firstly, this arrogance was demonstrated by the
DA’s refusal to vote for the expropriation of land without compensation in
parliament to allow black people to have access to the land. "In essence, the white dominated DA is rejecting the
sharing of land which was taken through a crime against the humanity of black
people," said Malema. He said the second show of arrogance by the white
dominated DA is conducting business in the Metro as if they have won elections
with an absolute majority. Malema accused the DA of failing to consult with other parties
and of  neglecting black communities in
the delivery of services. "There is no political party that has won elections
with an absolute majority in the Nelson Mandela Bay. This means all parties
represent an important player in the general will of the people. "Above all, this attitude that the removal of
Trollip or the DA is a rejection of the will of the people, reaffirms the very
arrogance with which the DA conducts itself in relation to other parties. "Thus, it must be punished." Malema added that the same arrogance is seen in the Tshwane
Metro where "the white caucus of the DA conducts itself as if they too
possess an absolute majority, when in fact they possess absolute arrogance". "We hate
corruption and we are always the first political party to expose it, but we
shall never be manipulated into becoming complicit with white supremacy." He said Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga was next on the list
to be removed.
