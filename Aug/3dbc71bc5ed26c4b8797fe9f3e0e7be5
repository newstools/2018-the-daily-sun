THE families of seven PAC activists who were hanged at Kgosi Mampuru II jail in the 1960s are relieved the bodies of their loved ones were exhumed yesterday. The PAC, who had almost 200 members hanged by the apartheid regime, is also happy that its struggle heroes will be buried in a dignified manner. President Narius Moloto said it was a very important to redeem the souls of their hanged members. He said they would continue with the exhumations until all those who were improperly buried had decent burials. “These are our heroes. Our mission is to reconnect them with their families and give them proper burials.” The seven bodies exhumed at Mamelodi West Cemetery in Tshwane were those of Richard Motsoahae (23), Josiah Motsumi (40), Thomas Molatlhegi (31), Petrus Ntshole (22), Katyana Zoya (34), Mpitizeli Zoya (39) and 46-year-old Mute Yawa. Thapelo Mokushane, co-ordinator of Gallows Exhumation Project, said the exhumations formed part of the project launched by Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha in 2016. The project aims to recover the remains of political prisoners who were hanged prior to the suspension of the death penalty in 1990. The bodies of the hanged political prisoners remained the property of the state and were given pauper burials around Tshwane. “The project is meant to help families find closure as they receive the remains of their loved ones,” he said. Cynthia Mocumi (64) said: “We have been waiting so long for this day to come.” Cynthia said her father’s remains would be reburied in Sterkfontein Cemetery, Mogale City. Ngaziyeki Yawa (63) from Lady Frere, Eastern Cape, said they would bury the remains of their father, who was hanged in 1961, at their family’s graveyard in Rawantsana Village. “It’s a healing process for which we’ve been waiting many years,” he said.
