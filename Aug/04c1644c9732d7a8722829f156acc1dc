Golden Globe award-winning actress, Taraji P. Henson has denied all knowledge of her appearance at the 2018 International Woman In Media Conference. The conference, due to take place at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg on the 5th of September has been a fixed feature on the trends list since the full line-up of speakers was announced yesterday. The announcement was made by the 21st Century Group, a media and asset management company who are behind the conference. The company promised fans that the event, to be hosted by African I.T girl, Bonang Matheba, would boast speakers including Connie Ferguson, Halle Berry, Ashanti, Claire Mawisa and Taraji P. Henson. Fans obviously went berserk and the news has been trending ever since. The news gained momentum this afternoon following the press launch of the event and eventually the tweets made it onto Taraj’s timeline. “False! I will not be there. NEVER HEARD OF THIS EVENT AND WAS NEVER INVITED. PLEASE REMOVE MY NAME FROM THIS EVENT BECAUSE IT IS FALSE,” she started. “I WILL NOT BE AT THIS EVENT. THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL. STOP IS MISLEADING MY FANS. IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED TIX TO SEE ME PLEASE GET A REFUND. THIS IS FAKE NEWS,” she continued. Devastated fans of the Empire star have continued to flood her timeline with questions about the event and Taraji has maintained that she will not be there. “I AM WORKING ON EMPIRE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE THERE. I HATE THAT THIS ORGANIZATION IS MISLEADING MY FANS,” she exclaimed. One fan even suggested that maybe her management team had confirmed her appearance without her knowledge, but she maintained that there is no such thing. “My team would NEVER agree to ANYTHING on my behalf w/o me knowing!!!!! NEVER! That is not how I run my businesses,” she said. Local fans are now reeling with devastation and wondering whether someone pretended to be Taraji’s manager and falsely represented her presence at the event, or if the organisers of the event really mislead fans to sell tickets. If you had to sell tickets for R1250 each. You'd also start telling people  Taraji is coming to your event ??????‍?? pic.twitter.com/n9bdUNpQAT
