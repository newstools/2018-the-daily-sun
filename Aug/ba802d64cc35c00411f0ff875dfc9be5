THE Road Traffic Management Corporation’s National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit and the Hawks arrested a syndicate operating at a licence testing station in Delmas. During the raid, three officials and two middlemen were arrested. They were charged with issuing fraudulent motor vehicle driver’s licences. The middlemen allegedly pretended to be operating driving schools to lure driver’s licence applicants to use their services. RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said it is believed that willing licence applicants travelled from other parts of the country to obtain their driving licences from this centre in exchange for a sum of R11 500 to R12 000. Investigators estimate that the officials and their accomplices generated more than R60 000 a day through the operation. “Investigations are continuing and more suspects are expected to be arrested,” Zwane said. The arrested officials and their accomplices are expected to appear at the Delmas Magistrate’s Court for a bail application.
