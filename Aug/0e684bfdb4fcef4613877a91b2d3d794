SHOPRITE officially opened the newly built Ndamase Preschool at Phepheni Village in Mfundisweni on Thursday. For years the creche had been operating from a crumbling building that was destroyed by storms several times. The new building has three fully furnished classrooms and was supplied with educational charts and books. Principal Noxolo Xuma said she and other women, who had since died, started the creche. “It wasn’t easy. We started working from a church, which we were chased out of.” Noxolo said the community realised the importance of early childhood development and had given them land. “They also made mud bricks, bought building material and built a centre for us.” The building was hit by several storms. Noxolo said she was advised to seek help from NGOs and the department of social development. “Shoprite came through for us and we got funding from social development,” she said. Lunga Schoeman from the supermarket giant said they answered the plea to build a new creche. “We’re a community-loving company, so we decided to build a new creche with the assistance of the unemployed youth from this village,” he said. “We also sponsored training for teachers from Ndamase and other neighbouring preschools. “We’ve brought in the Lunch Box Foundation to supply breakfast and lunch for a year. “Also, Food and Trees for Africa will assist the centre with a vegetable garden.”
