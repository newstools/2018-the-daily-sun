Sleeping for more than 8 hours each night increases the likelihood of an early death. Research suggests that people who get too much sleep are at greater risk of an early death than those who get too little. Scientific study reveals a 47% higher risk of heart disease and strokes The Daily Mail reported that the new study involved more than 3.3 million people from around the world. It was led by the universities of Keele, Manchester, Leeds and East Anglia. Experts found those who sleep for more than eight hours a night have greater mortality risk than those who sleep for less than seven hours. The study, involving more than 3.3 million people around the world, found sleeping for too long also raised the risk of heart disease and strokes. The scientists - from the universities of Keele, Manchester, Leeds and East Anglia - said excessive sleep should be considered a ‘marker’ of poor health. Long sleep duration may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease because of ... comorbidities that lead to fatigue, such as chronic inflammatory disorders and anaemia,’ they wrote. ‘Depressive symptoms, low socioeconomic status, unemployment and low physical activity are also associated with long sleep duration.’ The academics said doctors should screen patients who are sleeping for a long time each night for heart problems. Writing in the Journal of the American Heart Association, they said one explanation could be getting too much sleep means people get too little exercise, raising their risk of heart problems. But it is more likely that people who sleep for too long are already suffering from undiagnosed problems.
