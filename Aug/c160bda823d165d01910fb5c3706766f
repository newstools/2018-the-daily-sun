THE months-long wage strike by Eskom workers has ended after Eskom and unions signed a three-year wage agreement. But some employees may still face disciplinary action. Eskom, following talks with NUM, Numsa and Solidarity, signed the wage deal in the early hours of yesterday morning. Eskom said in a statement yesterday that salaries would increase by 7,5% – backdated to 1 July and additionally by 7% in the next two years. An annual cost of living adjustment to the housing allowance, and a once-off cash payment of R10 000 after tax, will be paid within 48 hours of the agreement being signed. Eskom human resource group executive Elsie Pule told the People’s Paper: “Eskom wishes to thank all the parties involved in the negotiation process for their endeavour in finding an amicable solution “The conclusion of these negotiations enables us to firmly focus on the Eskom of the future and building a sustainable business to power the nation and grow the economy.”
