MPUMALANGA Environmental Affairs MEC Vusi Shongwe raised concerns about illegal dumps. The MEC was part of a cleaning campaign that took place in Msogwaba, Ehlanzeni on Friday. Shongwe said residents need to ensure their surroundings are kept clean at all times. He said: “I was shocked by the lack of respect people have for the environment. “They dump their waste everywhere. “That’s why we want to set an example and urge everyone, young and old, to stop creating illegal dumping sites,” he said. Tshepo Sabatane from Imvelo Cleaning and Recycling Primary Co-operative said they partnered with the department and other stakeholders to reduce littering in the area. Sabatane told the SunTeam illegal dumping has always been a challenge. He said members of the community dump their rubbish wherever they please. Sabatane said some of the rubbish ends up in streams, creating a potential health hazard for the public.
