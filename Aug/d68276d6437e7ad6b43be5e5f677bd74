COSATU says government’s plans to retrench thousands of public servants is the ultimate betrayal. It has led to the trade union federation’s special central executive committee instructing officials to request an urgent meeting with the ANC top six. Speaking at Cosatu House in Joburg yesterday, general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali discussed preparations for their 13th national congress next month with the media. Ntshalintshali said workers would not vote against their own interests in the national elections. “We view the plans to retrench workers as an ultimate betrayal, especially after the government’s decision to increase VAT after promising not to do so. “This makes a mockery of the alliance. If the ANC abandons its own manifesto and sabotages our dreams and aspirations as workers, we have no reason to support it. “We demand a ban on all retrenchments until the promised job summit has been held, or we will pull out of it.” He said the ANC would pay the price for failing to balance the demands of capital and labour. And the Marikana massacre was a shameful symbol of how government and mining had failed workers for more than 100 years. “The tragedy was supposed to be a turning point, but over the past six years we’ve seen the mining sector retrench over 80 000 workers while 51 workers were killed in the past six months,” said Ntshalintshali. He said Monday’s meeting resolved to mobilise workers across the board to demand more action and accountability from mine bosses and government. The campaign would start with a march on Friday in Rustenburg against Implats.
