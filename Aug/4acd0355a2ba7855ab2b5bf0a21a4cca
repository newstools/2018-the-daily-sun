IF municipal leaders do not clean up their act soon, they run the risk of being rejected by the communities they serve. This was the warning issued by Thembi Nkadimeng, chairwoman of the South African Local Government Association, at the organisation’s provincial assembly. The gathering was held at 2Ten Hotel in Sibasa, outside Thohoyandou, on Tuesday and Wednesday. Nkadimeng said communities needed services from their leaders, not excuses. She said residents were not interested in hearing about how much money municipalities owed their service providers. “We need to fast-track service delivery and look at how we’re using our municipal infrastructure grants,” she said. “Struggling municipalities have to be assisted. “Municipalities need to make sure people are held accountable when there are failures. Vhembe mayor Florence Radzilani said the association needed to empower women councillors so they could effectively fight gender-based violence. “We should all be troubled by the fact that some people live in fear. “Children are not free to play in the streets. “We can’t look away when someone is raped. “We should echo the chants of the young women who took to the streets and said enough is enough. “Our bodies are not your crime scene.’” Chief Malesela Dikgale, a chairman of the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders, urged municipalities to treat all chief and kings equally. Chief Dikgale said service delivery would only improve once traditional leaders became a part of the municipality’s master plan.
