RESIDENTS claimed to have no idea what happened to a man found laying dead on the road, but he was allegedly beaten to death for stealing soap. Yesterday the man was found dead next to the road at KwaMashu Hostel. Apparently 30-year-old Sandile Phenyane from B section KwaMashu, north of Durban was beaten for stealing soap from a nearby spaza. A resident told Daily Sun that she heard that Sandile stole a pack of washing powder from a nearby spaza. The residents apparently saw him running away and ran after him. The resident said he was beaten with bricks and sticks. “They beat him on his head. He got up and tried to escape but he soon collapsed. No one went to help him,” said the resident. Another resident said Sandile was a whoonga addict who was trying his luck at the spaza. “I think this will send a strong message to other whoonga addicts that they shouldn’t mess with hostel residents,” the resident said. A man believed to be Sandile’s brother, who was at the scene, said he didn’t want to speak to Daily Sun. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said KwaMashu police found the body of a 30-year-old man after receiving a complaint. “It is alleged that he was assaulted by members of the community. Their motive is unknown. “A case of murder was opened at KwaMashu Police Station for investigation,” said Zwane.
