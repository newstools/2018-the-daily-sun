A WORRIED family wants help to get rid of a drug lord after their 14-year-old daughter went wild from using nyaope. The family from Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga said the girl and two of her friends were out of control. On Wednesday morning her angry 33-year-old mum, her 49-year-old gogo and some residents raided the abandoned house allegedly used by the girls and their boyfriends. But all they found were the girls’ clothes, empty beer bottles and leftover food. “We last saw her when she confessed to doing drugs to the police. The police did nothing other than say she was still under age,” said the mother. “My girl said she ran away from class to sell nyaope and dagga for a foreign drug lord who pays them with drugs and very little money.” The girl’s gogo said: “We are planning to speak to Community Safety MEC Pat Ngomane to intervene immediately.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Abigail Nxumalo said no cases had been reported.
