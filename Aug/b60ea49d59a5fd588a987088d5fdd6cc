TO fight gender-based violence, men have to take part in programmes that are meant to reduce the problem. Nonceba Family Counselling Centre manager Pauline Perez told DA shadow minister Bridget Masango and MP Thandi Mpambo-Sibukwana that men can be victims of their circumstances. “We inherited the culture of violence from apartheid,” she said. “Some of these men can’t afford to put food on the table for families. “That’s why we need programmes that incorporate them.” Social worker Athenkosi Gqweta said he runs a class for young men that teaches them about abuse. “I was shocked by the responses of many when we started this programme,” said Athenkosi. “I cater for kids from 12 years up to adults of 25 years. What some young people say is shocking. “Some believe women must be beaten because they cheat or force men to raise children that don’t biologically belong to them.” He has a big job trying to convince the youngsters that violence isn’t the answer. “I always tell them that not all women are the same and beating every woman on assumptions isn’t good. “It’s not a solution because when you do that, even if she wronged you, you may end up spending life in jail,” said Gqweta. The facility addresses human trafficking and caters for abused women and children. Masango and Mpambo-Sibukwana gave the centre the thumbs up for the work it does. “You are making a difference in the community,” said Masango. She promised to raise some of the challenges the facility faced in parliament. Pauline said they had a problem with the law, which required victims to move out after three months. “They start to respond to the treatment during that time. I think three months is not enough,” she said.
