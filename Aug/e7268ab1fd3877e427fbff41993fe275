A MISSING KZN Sharks Board employee’s corpse has finally been found. A group of fishermen on Saturday found Siyabonga Gabela’s body at Newark Beach in Richards Bay, on the north coast. Sharks board spokesman Harry Mbambo said Gabela’s memorial service will be held tomorrow. Gabela went missing after the boat he was in capsized two weeks ago. The bodies of his colleagues, Richard Gumede and Mandlakayise Gumede, were found a day after the incident. Eric Buthelezi and Siqiniseko Ngibekele escaped with their lives. A memorial service was held for Richard and Mandlakayise on Thursday. Community Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda, one of the speakers at the service, described the dead crew members as heroes because they died in the line of duty. He said: “We wish to convey our deepest condolences to the families of the dead men. “Their loved ones didn’t die in vain. They risked their lives to save millions of people who visit our beaches.” Environmental Affairs MEC Sihle Zikalala said the tragedy was the first of its kind since the board was formed 60 years ago. He said according to the information he had received, there were no high tides before the crew set out to sea. But Zikalala said a sudden change in sailing conditions caused the boat to capsize.
