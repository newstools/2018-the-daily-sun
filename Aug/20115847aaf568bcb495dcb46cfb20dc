BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt has no choice but to make the most of what he has, with his squad weakened by injuries to key players. Losing back-to-back league games is not an option for Hunt either as he strives to reclaim their Absa Premiership crown from Mamelodi Sundowns. Downs’ neighbours, SuperSport United, ended the Clever Boys’ unbeaten run in the Premiership at Milpark Stadium two weeks ago – a defeat that will have left a bitter taste in the Wits coach’s mouth. United beat them 1-0 at Milpark. Tonight, Wits host AmaZulu at Bidvest Stadium (7.30pm) hoping for a return to winning ways. Those in the casualty ward include Gift Motupa, Granwald Scott and Daylon Claasen. Hunt, whose side are still top of the standings despite their loss to SuperSport, has promised to reshuffle his pack when Usuthu come to town and expects nothing but victory. He said: “I was not happy with the way the team played against SuperSport but we have to try and move on. There is nothing we can do about it now, it’s gone. “What I ask of the players ahead of the next game is that they must be consistent Added the coach: “I want to see goals. We keep creating chances but we fail to convert them. I want to see more hunger from the players this season. We can’t lose another game at home.” Their failure to finish in the top eight in the previous season was in part due to their poor home record. But this time around Wits have players like Deon Hotto, Terrence Dzvukamanja and Haashim Domingo who can make life difficult for Usuthu. Hunt agrees that if they want to improve and challenge for the league title they have to improve their home record. He explained: “You won’t achieve anything if you don’t win your home matches. Most of our losses came at home last season, but I have challenged my players to be consistent and collect maximum points at home.”
