Journalists, Justice Malala and Siki Mgabadeli are bidding farewell to news channel, eNCA. Their departures were announced by the channel this week, citing two different reasons for each. According to eNCA, Justice, who was the host of The Justice Factor, is leaving the 24-hour news network after nearly ten years to go on sabbatical with his family. Justice, who started his TV career with sister channel, e.tv said that he would forever be grateful for the opportunity. “eNCA is like family to me. We have laughed, fought, kissed, made up and delivered great television together since the day the station asked me to appear on its shows. I have no doubt it will continue to be vigorous and to report without fear or favour,” said Justice. The final Justice Factor show was broadcast on Monday, 30 July. Meanwhile, Siki is allegedly leaving the channel to “start a new chapter in her life”. Siki, whose last show aired on Tuesday, 31 July, had been with eNCA for four years and was at the helm of Moneyline. “It’s been an incredible four years. I am especially proud of the 485 episodes of Moneyline and my superstar team. We did things I had only dreamt of doing. Thank you to these great journalists and producers. And thank YOU for watching,” said Siki. The channel expressed great loss over losing the two respected journalists.
