MPUMALANGA Social Development MEC Busi Shiba says nyaope addiction in the province is on the rise. She was speaking during a substance and drug abuse summit in Mbombela on Thursday. The theme of the two-day summit was: “Listening to children and young people”. It was held in response to a call from residents and stakeholders to address the issue of drugs in communities. Shiba said use of nyaope has almost doubled since 2016, which is a big challenge for the province. “The biggest part of our campaign focuses on users and their rehabilitation. “Not much is done about stopping the supply. This is the area that needs a collective effort from everyone to make a difference.” The MEC said the aim was to help create clear guidelines for setting up, registering, providing and managing community-based substance abuse services. She said residents and those involved should understand the importance of setting up these services. “They will serve as the main point of intervention,” she said. “There also is a need to explain the roles of different people and residents in fighting substance abuse. “A plan of action must be adopted for people who are suffering from drug abuse and other addictions.” Pupil Chantel Nxumalo said it was a great platform for them to share their experiences of drug abuse that they have come across in their communities. “From here, it will help us reduce the risk of being involved in drugs. “ This is the first step in helping us create a drug-free environment,” Chantel said.
