THESE tenants are gatvol of being victims of crime while paying for security. More than 100 tenants from Own Haven in East London, a government subsidised rental property, forced their way into the management offices yesterday. They demanded tighter security at the complex. Tenants committee leader, Nyameka Klaas, said they handed over a petition to management. “There aren’t enough security guards at the complex. We have break-ins every week. How can they employ two security guards for such a big complex?” asked Klaas. “We pay R250 for security every month. Yesterday, we were supposed to pay an additional R53.” One of the tenants said: “On Tuesday, my car wheels were removed by thugs. I reported it to officials. I was told there was nothing that can be done. “Our belongings are stolen while we are pay for security. What exactly are we paying for?” Own Haven representative Justin Wittstock accepted the petition on behalf of the housing tribunal. He said he would hand it over to the relevant officials. “I cannot answer any questions regarding the petition. What I can guarantee is that for now, there will be no additions of money for security upgrades until we meet your representatives,” he told the tenants. A meeting between officials and tenants will be held today.
