ONE of the things that most worries the transport department in the Free State is road fatalities. On Friday, officials from the department held a public speaking event with pupils from the Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality at Lerato-Uthando Secondary School in Harrismith. Municipal official Thokozile Hadebe said road safety should be made part of the school curriculum. She said they had a lot of programmes to educate young children about staying safe on the roads. Teacher Khaweni Mthimkulu from Lerato-Uthando said five pupils from the school’s debating team made a presentation at the event. “Our pupils who were not part of this project lost a lot because we learned many useful skills here,” she said. Mondli Mkhwanazi (17), a grade 11 pupil at Harrismith Secondary School, said those who took part in the event would gather other residents in community halls and educate them about road safety. Thabang Mpele (18), a pupil at Lerato-Uthando, said she was happy to see all the pupils who took part in the project had been on their best behaviour. Malemoha Mokoenihi, the founder of the Kamohau Community Organisation, said irresponsible drivers cost the country a lot of money. “We need our future leaders to make a difference in their families’ lives. We don’t need them sitting in wheelchairs or losing their lives unnecessarily.” Mokoenihi advised young people to respect the rules of the road. “They must stop using headphones while walking on the roads. “They also need to stop bragging about how they’ll get cash from the Road Accident Fund if a driver hits them,’ he said.
