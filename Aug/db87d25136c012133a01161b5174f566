KELETSO Makgalwa reckons joining Maritzburg United from Mamelodi Sundowns will help speed up his growth in the PSL. The 21-year-old was promoted to Downs’ senior team last season but was unable to break into Pitso Mosimane’s starting XI. His loan move to the Team of Choice is part of a swap deal that saw Lebohang Maboe moving to the opposing side on a permanent basis. Makgalwa has already played two matches for United and scored on debut in the team’s second league defeat this season away to Free State Stars last Wednesday. He was an instant fan favorite in his first home match on Sunday, performing like he has been with the team for years. He linked up well with Siphesihle Ndlovu, Bandile Shandu and Keagan Buchanan, although that was not enough to prevent United suffering their third defeat in a row. The winger says he is now focused on the upcoming match against Kaizer Chiefs at Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg on Friday (8pm). Said Makgalwa: “My aim is to work hard to earn more game-time at Maritzburg United. But this is not about me, it is all about the team and making sure United do even better than last season. The past three matches didn’t go well for us but this is not the time to panic. We need to be united as a team and go out there against Chiefs fully focused. Team spirit will help us get a positive result.” He added that his heart and mind were on the Team of Choice: “I still have a long way to go. But I’m willing to work even harder. I am a goal-scorer and I feel that I need to improve a lot to do that for United.”
