Men are flocking to Dr Norman Rowe to increase the size
of their 4-5s. The New York post reports that Dr. Norman Rowe, aka “Dr.
Penis,” provides penile fillers for his male patients that last up to two
years. The doctor says he does a lot of plastic augmentation and
this led to people naming him Dr Penis. Dr 45's procedure only makes the 4-5 thicker, not longer. He said this is because it is the width of the 4-5 that
counts, not the length. He says his procedure is non-surgical and takes up to 20
minutes. "It's a series of 8 to 10 injections He says the
whole procedure takes up to 20 minutes. "It gives men
a whopping two inch increase in circumference," said the doctor. The nonsurgical procedure — which injects hyaluronic acid
into a man’s 45 — costs as much as $25,000, that is R337125 in South African
currency. The doctor told The Post: “It’s not a stigma to go to a
plastic surgeon. “There’s nothing wrong with a man wanting to look and
feel as good as he possibly can.”
