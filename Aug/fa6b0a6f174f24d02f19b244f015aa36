TV personality Bonang Matheba has lost her temper on social media, engaging in a heated twar with entertainment commentator Phil Mphela. This comes after Mphela described Matheba's decision to sue the Sunday World newspaper for R10 million over their cover story "ill-advised." READ: BONANG CLAIMS R10M IN DAMAGES FROM PUBLICATION! ICYMI: 'GO F*** YOURSELF’ – BONANG TELLS CRITIC! The two are no strangers to this sort of exchange having gotten involved in another spat over Matheba's opinion splitting Galmour Magazine cover three years ago. The bad blood between them has reared its head once again, this time over the alleged lawsuit Matheba has filed against the Sunday World newspaper. While Matheba’s fans, the “Bhive,” were quick to come to their queens defence on social media, she had not given much attention to Mphela’s comments. However, on Tuesday, she seemingly lost her cool and decided to give Mphela a piece of her mind in a mini rant. Matheba tweeted: “You’re a parasite. A scum bag. A disgusting example of the filth I have to deal with on a daily basis. You know nothing about the industry you claim to work in... Die slow! Your mess ends today!” “I’ve ignored your vitriol for three years! Shame, a few tweets got you hot & heavy? Welcome to it,” she continued before blocking Mphela.
