A 27-year-old man tried faking his own death, by taking photos
of himself acting dead in a mortuary. He did this allegedly, so that his wife would stop asking for
money from him. Danny Gonzalez is formerly from Honduras but currently
lives in the United States. In the photos, he had cotton wool in his
nose and mouth and he was covered in a white sheet all over his body. Following that he sent the photos to his wife who lives in southern
Honduras. The message that his wife received suggested that he had
died from cancer and asthma. However, according to THE
MIRROR it backfired after local media in his hometown started to report his
sudden death. But it didnâ€™t take relatives long to realise all was not as
it seemed, as Gonzalez appeared to be grinning in the photos. Others noticed that he appeared to be lying in a doubled
bed, and the white sheet over his body was actually a pillow cover.
