 Mzansi’s
number one, Cyril Ramaphosa, has announced NPA Deputy National Director Silas
Ramaite as Shaun Abraham’s replacement. The
announcement was made following a Constitutional Court ruling that former
National Director of Public Prosecution (NDPP) head Shaun Abraham’s appointment
was invalid. “Dr Silas
Ramaite is the NPA Deputy National Director responsible for Administration and
Office for Witness Protection. He has served as deputy director of the
Authority for 15 years,” said Ramaphosa. “He holds
the degrees B.Proc (University of Fort Hare), LL.B; LL.M, specializing in
Criminal Law, Constitutional Law, Administrative Law and Public International
Law and LL.D, specializing in Constitutional Law (University of South Africa). He was
admitted as an advocate of the Supreme Court in 1988 and was granted the status
of Senior Counsel (SC) in 2001.” “President
Ramaphosa has wished Dr Ramaite well in his new role and expressed his belief
that this week’s court judgment has set the NPA on a path that will restore the
integrity of the Authority and build the nation’s confidence in the criminal
justice system,” the Presidency also said.
