THREE men died in a horrific accident on the R40 between Bushbuckridge and Dwarsloop on Tuesday afternoon. The crash occurred when the driver of a white Mazda 323 lost control and hit a tree. Bushbuckridge police spokeswoman Captain Ndlovukazi Mashele said the car split into two. The driver and two occupants were certified dead by paramedics at the scene. Witnesses say the driver had just dropped off passengers in Shatale, and was on his way to Sabie. Ringane Emergency Medical Services spokesman Present Mogani said they received a phone call from the police at about 3.45pm on Tuesday. “Paramedics and firefighters arrived at the scene 20 minutes later, only to find out there were no survivors,” said Mogani. Mashele said a case of culpable homicide had been opened for further investigation. “The cause of the accident is not yet known. The R40 has frequent fog, and it is also possible that the driver was speeding.” Pat Ngomane, MEC for Community Safety, Security and Liaison urged motorists to obey the rules of the road at all times, “Road accidents are costing government a lot of money. “Drivers must change their attitudes. They need to understand that the road does not belong to them alone. “There are other motorists who use the roads as well. They should also respect their passengers,” said Ngomane.
