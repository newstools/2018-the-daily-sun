Have you ever just looked at your closet full of clothes and screamed, “I have nothing to wear!” Having a closet full of clothes that you don’t actually wear is one of the most frustrating things on earth. We are in the last month of winter and in the second half of the year. This is the perfect time to evaluate your closet and check what you want to keep and what you want to toss. Now if you’re looking to clean out your closet or go on a new shopping spree, here are some guild lines when it comes to structuring your closet. Figure out your style If you have not already figured out your style, this is a good place to start. The best place to start is to look at a celebrity, blogger or influencer who you admire their style and also look to a celebrity, blogger or influences whose style is somewhat similar to yours right now. It’s also very important to know who you are, know what you’re comfortable in and what resonates to you and your personality.  60-20-20 The 60-20-20 guild line is a guild line to show you that you should fill your closet up with 60% of basic items, This could be a black dress, white sneakers, a white shirt, a black blazer, a dark demin jean. These items are basic items of neutral colours. Then you should fill your closet with 20% of loud, expressive items, this could be red heels, a floral print dress, a pink lace blouse. These items are items that you will use to compliment your basic items. Then finally the last 20% of your closet should be filled with accessories. These are items such as earrings, handbags, necklaces, scarves. These items will take your outfits to another level.             80/20 rule Have you ever heard the saying that we wear 20% of the clothes in our closets 80% of the time? Well if you relate to never knowing what to wear when you have a closet full of clothes, this rule applies to you. If this is you, change that notion and revamp your closet in a way that is inviting, that makes your happy and that you’ll be wearing all your clothes in your closet. Always remember that it’s better to have less clothes but you know that you wear every one of those items in your closet than having so many clothes and be stuck with “I don’t know what to wear”.
