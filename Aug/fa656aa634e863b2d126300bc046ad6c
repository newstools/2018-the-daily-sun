WESTERN Cape Health MEC Dr Nomafrench Mbombo opened a new surgical ward and a CT scan suite at Khayelitsha District Hospital in Cape Town on Friday. She said a shortage of beds had forced patients to wait longer for services. “The hospital has 300 beds and operates at a 130% bed occupancy rate, as it provides district and regional health care services,” said the MEC. Mbombo said the new surgical ward had 30 beds. The scan suite was already in use and would operate at full capacity from Monday. “This will help because patients will no longer be transferred to Tygerberg for CT scans.” The MEC said plans were under way to create a new mental health unit with 32 beds. She said a temporary unit had been created and was fully operational. “Beds will also be made available at Zandvliet Care Facility from 1 September.” Patients who were not extremely ill but required further care before being discharged would be transferred to the facility and receive ongoing care. The MEC said this would be done to free up beds at Khayelitsha District Hospital. Khayelitsha resident Nkosekhaya Madolo (37) said the community was pleased with the addition of the new ward and scan suite. She said: “I am sure people from outside Khayelitsha are happy because they will also benefit from these services. “We no longer have to pay money for a CT scan.”
