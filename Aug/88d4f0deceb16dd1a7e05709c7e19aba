CRIME suspects are usually not happy to see the cops – but this guy, who allegedly stole money at an ATM, was very happy to see them arrive. An angry crowd had set upon him in his shiny car at the weekend and they were threatening to skin him alive. Cops in Mahikeng, North West rescued him on Friday. Mahikeng police spokeswoman Sergeant Keneilwe Tshabile said a woman identified the suspect as the man who just moments earlier had stolen her bank card as she was withdrawing money from an ATM. The amount of R600 was missing from her bank account as a result. Shoppers abandoned their engagements and surrounded the suspect inside a metallic BMW 530i. The car’s tyres were slashed but the suspect remained hunched on the back seat, apparently keeping his head down to avoid people seeing him through the window. After what looked like a refusal by the suspect to unlock the car door, the crowd went wild, smashing windows with big rocks while others jumped on top of the car. The alleged suspect was dragged out, kicked, punched and left with blood covering the back of his head. Cops at the scene had to call for back-up to rescue the man from further injuries. Tear gas was fired to disperse the crowd and the suspect was rescued and arrested. A case of theft was registered and the suspect will appear in the Mmabatho Magistrates Court today.
