UNHAPPY ANC members marched to the party’s offices on Thursday. The members of various branches in the OR Tambo region protested outside the regional offices in Mthatha. They wanted to hand over their grievances to the Provincial Executive Committee. Protest leader Lawrence Mambila said: “We want to have a regional general council to discuss the NEC’s decision to hold the regional elective conference early. “We also want the position of the secretary in the region to be filled.” The conference is scheduled to run from Thursday to Saturday but it’s not clear if it will go ahead as planned. This is because some members are unhappy with the NEC’s decision to hold the conference before the end of next month. Members complained this was before regional leaders’ terms ended in October. “We were never consulted by the leadership about its decision to hold the conference earlier,” said Mambila. They gave the PEC seven days to answer to their concerns. PEC member Fundile Gade accepted the petition and said he would take it to the provincial secretary. “We will definitely deal with your issues and get back to you,” said Gade.
