THEY were lovers for a year, but love turned sour when Madillo Molale received a message on her cellphone on Sunday night. The 25-year-old was hacked with an axe before being dumped on the side of the R719 road between Bothaville and Hoopstad, Free State. A passerby alerted cops to the scene after finding Madillo’s body in the bushes. A source said: “I am still in shock to learn about Madillo’s death. Before cops arrested her boyfriend, he told me that Madillo was cheating on him and he couldn’t take it. “He said after he failed to get Madillo to tell him who the other man was, he picked up an axe and hacked her. “He claimed that he became scared and decided to drag her body next to the road and make it look like she was hit by a car. “He claimed the message made it obvious that his girlfriend was poking someone.” Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said: “A 27-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with murder. This is after he allegedly hacked his girlfriend with an axe. “The body of the woman was found on the side of the road. The bloodied murder weapon was found not far from the scene and seized.” The suspect appeared in the Bothaville Magistrates Court yesterday. His case was postponed to 30 August for a bail application.
