THE Emalahleni
Regional Court has sentenced Mzwakhe Madonsela (44), and Godwin Vilakazi (35)
to 18 months for card skimming. The duo were first arrested in April 2012, after being implicated in several
cases of theft, malicious damage to property, possession of illegal Point Of
Sale (POS) devices  and conspiracy to commit crime. Mpumalanga HAWKS spokesperson Dineo Sekgotodi said they were then granted bail
but they fled court proceedings. Sekgotodi said while they were on the run, they continued to commit
similar offenses. The Hawks Serious Commercial Investigation unit’s probe revealed that the duo
were part of a syndicate that had been operating for a while. She said a crime intelligence driven operation led to the pair being re-arrested
in 2016. They made a series of court appearances ending in their recent conviction and
sentence.
