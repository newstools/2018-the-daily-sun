RUBBISH is starting to pile up in parts of Soweto following Pikitup’s decision to suspend services in the area. This comes after hostel dwellers took to the streets last week demanding they be given jobs at local depots. The protesters closed the gates at depots and blocked workers from entering or leaving the premises. On Friday, they burned a Pikitup truck and destroyed another one by stoning it. Pikitup then decided to suspend its services in Soweto to keep employees safe. Mofolo resident Noxolo Mbatha (32) told Daily Sun that she had no choice but to throw rubbish on to the street. “I couldn’t keep it in the yard because it was stinking and posed a danger to me and my family.” Pikitup spokesman Muzi Mkhwanazi said they had extended the suspension of waste collection services to the Orange Farm and Midrand depots. “We regret the ongoing inconvenience caused, but we are forced to suspend waste collection services due to the volatile and unsafe situation outside some of our depots.” He said protesters were continuing to demand jobs from Pikitup and threatening the lives of employees. “The managing director of Pikitup, Lungile Dhlamini, who is also the chief safety officer, is unfortunately left with no choice but to suspend services in order to protect the lives of employees.” Mxolisi Thusini, the protestors’ representative, told the SunTeam they wouldn’t stop protesting until they were heard. He accused Pikitup of being corrupt. “They won’t give us jobs because we don’t have money to bribe them. Who said jobs should be sold?”
