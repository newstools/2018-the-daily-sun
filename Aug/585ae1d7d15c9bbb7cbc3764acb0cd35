 A number of restaurants at the Bela Bela Waterfront in Limpopo have been completely destroyed by a raging fire, said one of the owners on Sunday. "It happened around about 23:00 on Friday night and all we know is that the fire started at the back of the restaurant," Marize Briel, the owner of the Rodeo’s Restaurant and Saloon – which is where the fire originated - told News24. She said that around the time the fire first broke out, one of her friends was driving past and noticed the fire. He stopped and attempted to put it out. However "when he took out the pipe, there was no water", said Briel. She said the water cuts were a municipal issue. She also said that previously, at the Waterfront there had been another fire a few months ago, and a similar problem had occurred with the water. The Bela Bela municipality could not be immediately reached for comment. Along with Rodeo’s, Century 21, De Dekke Restaurant, Waffle House were amongst the premises that also burnt down.  Limpopo police spokesperson, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the incident. "We are therefore calling on all members of the community in the area to come forward with information which can assist us, especially to the cause of the fire in this complex." Briel said that inspectors would come on Monday to establish the cause of the fire. Asked about how she was coping in the aftermath, Briel said the community and owners of the Waterfront had been very supportive. "We just believe in God. [and] that he has got a better plan for us,” she said.
