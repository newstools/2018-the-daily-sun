The Durban ICC was filled with tears and excitement on Saturday. Women shed tears of joy at the seventh annual Mbokodo Awards ceremony. The event was attended by a number of amazing women in the arts, media and entertainment industry, aas well as top government officials. Ranging from film and performance to dance and literature, the awards – created by Carol Bouwer Productions – aim to recognise women who have shown leadership, fostered growth and made respectable efforts to strengthen the arts. The Queen of Mpondo music, musician Latozi Mpahleni, better known as Madosini Manqina, did a great performance when accepting the award for her role in the music industry. Speaking in Xhosa, Madosini thanked the event organisers. “I really appreciate that women who are uneducated like me can be recognised as well. Thank you,” she said. Veteran actress Mary Twala, who walked away with the Lifetime Achievement award, burst into tears. “I appreciate the award and I’m grateful for it. This has been a great journey in my life. “I hope our children will continue with it and go far in life,” said Mary. Minister of International Relations Lindiwe Sisulu encouraged women to keep doing well in their fields. “Women are powerful and therefore it’s good to celebrate each other like this. “We must stand together and fight women and children abuse,” said Sisulu. CEO of CB Productions Carol Bouwer said she was pleased with the turnout and felt that everything went well. “We hope that next year we will come back to Durban for these awards. Hopefully there will be more women,” she said.
