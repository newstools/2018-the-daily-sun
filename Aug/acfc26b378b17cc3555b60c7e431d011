“I CAN’T be healed so let me die a happy person.” These were the words of Karabo Baloyi, who has been suffering from chronic bronchitis for years. She is hooked up to an oxygen machine. After spending months in hospital, the 16-year-old from Meadowlands in Soweto was given a portable oxygen machine by the education department but it has since broken, leaving her unable even to attend school. Her gogo, Lydia Pani (58) said Karabo was given a cheque for R38 000 by Archbishop Petrus Khanyi of Blue Heaven and Believers in Christ International Church for an operation but it never happened and the church took back the money. “The hospital told us the lung operation couldn’t be done in this country. “They said if it was done, Karabo might not even survive two months afterwards,” said Lydia. She said the family knew it was the end of the road but Karabo had always dreamt of going on holiday to Durban. “She always said if that happened, she would die peacefully. We wanted to use the money to at least make her dream come true,” said gogo Lydia. She said the dream was shattered when the church told them they wouldn’t get a cent. Karabo told Daily Sun: “I know I can’t be healed but a holiday would mean a lot to me. “It would give me the happiness I’ve never had in my life.” Church spokeswoman Nondumiso Dlamini said they did everything they could to help Karabo. “When the operation couldn’t be done, we took the money back so we can help other children in need. The money wasn’t meant for a holiday or anything else but for the operation,” she said.
