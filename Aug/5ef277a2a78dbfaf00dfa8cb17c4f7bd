SUPERSPORT United striker Bradley Grobler can’t wait for the new Absa Premiership season to start. The 30-year-old striker has been out of action for more than six months with a knee injury. Grobler sustained the injury playing for Bafana Bafana against Cape Verde in a 2018 Russia World Cup qualifier last year. The former Ajax Cape Town and Platinum Stars player had to look on helplessly from his couch at home as his side struggled last season. “It has been a tough time for me watching the team from home,” admits Grobler. He is expected to be in the mix to make the team that will face Cape Town City in their opening league clash at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Said Grobler: “I can’t wait for the 2018-19 season to start – I feel ready. I am happy to be back and I hope I can avoid injuries this season. I love football and I am happiest when I am playing. I am raring to go.” Last season, the three-times PSL champions had a dismal run in the Premiership and had to fight to avoid relegation under interim coach Kaitano Tembo. Tembo replaced Eric Tinkler, who resigned due to pressure. But United qualified for the top eight due to Ajax Cape Town’s Tendai Ndoro saga which saw the Urban Warriors get docked points and relegated to the National First Division. “SuperSport are a big team and I don’t think we will be fighting to avoid relegation again this season,” said the Bafana player. “We have a strong team that will be fighting for the championship and other trophies this season. I have seen the team we have and the good job Kaitano is doing during the pre-season preparations. “I am impressed with his work ethic and new players we have signed. They will add value to the team.” Grobler is optimistic Tembo will be a good coach if given a chance. “He has been with the team for many years. He knows the culture of this club and what is expected of him,” he said.
