KAIZER Chiefs have completed the signing of Bafana Bafana striker Lebogang Manyama. Chiefs confirmed the arrival of Manyama on a free transfer, following his release from Turkish side Konyaspor last month. The Soweto giants welcomed the 27-year-old to their squad in time for this weekend's MTN8 semi-final first leg against his former club SuperSport United.

Manyama joined Amakhosi on a three-year-deal. “It’s a dream come true,” saidManyama. “I have supported Chiefs from a young age. I grew up on the same street as Brian Baloyi in Alexandra and that’s how I fell in love with the club."“I now want to help the club win trophies and to achieve glory, because that’s what the Kaizer Chiefs brand represents to me.” Chiefs confirmed the signing of the former Cape Town City skipper on their official Twitter account on Wednesday.
