AT home it’s women who often hold the purse strings. So if they control budgets and finances in their households, they need sound money management skills. This was said at Ubank’s financial wellbeing workshop in Klerksdorp, North West, on Saturday. The bank hosted women from various stokvels and societies. During the sessions, the women spoke about how they were unemployed and bought wares to sell to customers. The bank’s Baatseba Moripe said: “Everyone here has said they’re not working. But everyone talks about buying and selling goods. Why is this not employment to you?” She said women had to change their mindsets. “You’re actually entrepreneurs, but because your minds tell you you’re not working you don’t see growth in what you’re doing.” Moripe said this needed to change. The women were taught about personal finance, financial planning, setting short and long-term goals, spending wisely, prioritising their needs and saving money. The women were given hints on cybercrime, group savings and investments. The initiative was formed as part of the bank’s Women’s Month celebrations. It was also aimed to commemorate the late liberation struggle stalwart Albertina Sisulu. The bank’s CEO Luthando Vutula said that the women needed to play active roles in their own financial lives. “As a responsible financial services provider, it’s our responsibility to ducate and empower our customers, especially women. “They often forwsard their financial knowledge through stokvels, societies and social gatherings.”
