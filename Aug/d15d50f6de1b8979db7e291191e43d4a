Nurses at Rahima Moosa and other hospitals are being raped and cases are not reported. This is according to the second deputy president of the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (DENOSA), Thandeka Msibi. She was speaking at the the Women’s Day Celebration event at Rahima Moosa Hospital in Coronationville, Joburg on Monday. Hundreds of nurses joined MEC of Health Gwen Ramokgopa and Minister of Public Services and Administration and NEC member Ayanda Dlodlo. They renewed their nurses’ pledge, led by the minister. Msibi slammed the lack of security at hospitals as a main cause of rape and sexual assault. “Nurses are being attacked and raped by victims’ family members and staff members because there is no security, as the security has been outsourced,” she said. “We have witnessed a series of attacks of nurses in a variety of our facilities by members of the community,” Ramokgopa said. “This act must be condemned with the strongest terms it deserves. “As the Department of Health we say “NO to the attack of Nurses” or any other health professional.” “We have taken note of the dire needs at this particular hospital and we shouldmake means to meet these challenges to enable the institution to deliver services to our people,” Dlodlo said.
