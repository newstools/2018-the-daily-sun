AFTER struggling to register a victory in three Absa Premiership matches, Kaizer Chiefs which saw Kaizer Chiefs equalling their 2006-07 worst start of the season, Amakhosi coach Giovanni Solinas is under immense pressure to win the MTN8 title. Amakhosi have gone three whole seasons without a trophy for the first time in history. And their poor start to the league campaign, where they’ve played three draws and lost one in four matches,  has added more salt to Chiefs fans’ wounds. Their hopes of having a successful season can now be only revived by winning the top eight title, which they last won in 2014. But Amakhosi face an uphill battle against reigning champions SuperSport United. The two teams face each other in a two-legged semi-final clash, with the first leg taking place today at the Lucas Moripe Stadium (3pm). Chiefs coach Solinas said they can’t be judged on their past. Said Solinas: “You can’t compare the past games and this one. This is an important one. You can’t compare our Baroka and Maritzburg games (league). The start doesn’t count now. SuperSport are a new game, new history. “We know it’s going to be difficult. SuperSport have good players and I know they have a good coach. I know my colleague (Kaitano Tembo) is very good. Chiefs new signings Lebogang Manyama and Mario Booysen will not be available for this encounter. Tembo, who was on the bench as assistant coach to Eric Tinkler when Matsatsantsa A Pitori won the title last season, admitted that there’s pressure on his side to defend the title. “I’m in a different role now where I have to coach the teams there’s a bit of pressure,” said the SuperSport coach.This is a cup game and you know Chiefs are Chiefs, you can never take them for granted. They are capable of producing good result at any given time.” To reach this stage of the tournament Chiefs knocked out Free State Stars 3-0 while Matsatsantsa eliminated Orlando Pirates 4-3 on penalties to book their place in the semis’.
