Three men have been arrested after being found in possession of suspected counterfeit bank notes during a raid in Gezina, Pretoria, police say. The raid took place on Wednesday after the police received a tip-off. "The suspects were found inside one of the units at a block of flats. The suspected counterfeit notes were recovered in a lock-up garage that is reportedly reserved to that unit," Tshwane police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said in a statement. The suspects - aged 19, 38 and 39 - will be charged with possession of suspected counterfeit cash and are expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court soon. SOURCE:Â NEWS24
