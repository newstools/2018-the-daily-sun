ASONELE Mqobonga (21) from Marikana squatter camp was killed on his day off. He was visiting a friend in Lower Crossroads, Philippi East in Cape Town on Tuesday. Asonele was apparently shot in the head and back while running away from robbers. His older brother Asanele (24) said: “I don’t know what happened. My brother was not a troublemaker. “He worked at Shoprite in Bellville. He took the day off from work to visit his hometown friend from Cofimvaba in the Eastern Cape. He was just visiting his friend and had no clue he was about to be killed.” A witness said she saw Asonele running. “He was with two girls. I think they were being robbed or something. When I heard shots I ran for cover because these criminals are heartless. I didn’t want to get killed,” said the witness. Lower Crossroads residents said a lot of crime takes place in the area where Asonele was killed. “This is not new to us. Things like this happen almost every week. “Criminals are doing what they want and any time they want,” said the resident. Brothers Asonele and Asanele lived together in Marikana. “I am so hurt about what has happened. The fact that he was running away makes it even more difficult for me to accept his death,” said Asanele. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexan said: “A case of murder has been opened for investigation following an incident in Khozi Street. No arrest has been made at this stage.”
