DURBAN businessman Calvin Mathibeli has dared eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede to take him to court over his bribery claims. Gumede said on Wednesday she was planning to sue Mathibeli. He has in the past publicly accused the ANC, which runs the municipality, of taking an amount of R100 000 from him. Speaking in her capacity as regional chairwoman, Gumede denied ever asking Mathibeli to fund the party’s election campaign in 2016. She said she had never contacted him for a donation and the ANC had not taken money from him. “I’m taking Mathibeli to court, so I can’t talk more on this issue,” said Gumede. “I want him to produce evidence in court of when he gave me money. “I’m being victimised because, when I came in as mayor, I implemented radical economic transformation framework policies. “Those who were benefiting before I came in have started a campaign to tarnish my name.” Regional secretary Bheki Ntuli also denied claims that the party received any donations from the wealthy businessman. But Mathibeli said he had evidence and that he paid for ANC branding material. He said he would meet Gumede in court. Two weeks ago, Mathibeli wrote on Facebook that Gumede had asked him for an amount of R100 000, which he said he gave her. He claimed she had also asked him for a further R150 000 for her foundation but he had refused and fallen out with the mayor. As a result, Mathibeli was apparently not paid for work he had done for the municipality.
