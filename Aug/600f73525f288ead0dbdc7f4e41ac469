THE men and women in blue don’t just chase after thugs. This was what KZN cops told pupils at a career open day they held at King’s Park Stadium in Durban last Thursday. It was attended by residents, pupils and college students who were told about the various career options in the police. They had a chance to see various units showing their expertise through various demonstrations. Speaking at the event, Lieutenant-General Fannie Masemola, the acting provincial police commissioner, said they wanted to inform the youth of the various units so they could consider careers in the police force. “There are three levels in the SAPS. The first one has entry level officers, the second level has semi skilled officers and the third level has professionals,” said Masemula. Thobeka Bhengu (16), a grade 10 pupil at Avonford Secondary School in Phoenix, Durban said she wanted to be a cop after high school. “Today I’ve seen that being a cop is not only about chasing thugs. “One can do other things such as being in the HR department of the police,” she said. Thobeka said she would apply to get into the SAPS after matric and only study further once she was accepted. Another pupil Yomelela Mzamo (16), also a grade 10 pupil at the same school, said he wanted to join the VIP protection unit. “Today was very interesting for me. I saw the dog unit and how the public order unit disperses violent protesting crowds. I learnt a lot and think I’ve made up my mind.”
