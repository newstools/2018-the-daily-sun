AN ALLEGED sexual harassment scandal involving a grade 10 teacher at an independent school in Polokwane, Limpopo has ruffled the feathers of Limpopo MEC for Education Ishmael Kgetjepe. The MEC expressed his disgust over the matter, calling for an urgent investigation despite the fact that Northern Academy is a private school. In a document seen by Daily Sun, the grade 10 pupil reported an incident of sexual harassment by his teacher who had reportedly asked the pupil to let him “suck him off.” This was apparently so that the pupil wouldn’t get “yellow cards” but green cards instead. The pupil said in his letter that he refused to be sucked off by the teacher who ordered him to remain in class after school. He expressed his shock and confided in his father who took the matter up with the school. The alleged incident occurred on 26 July. The pupil said told Daily Sun he was terrified because the alleged perpetrator was back at work following an investigation conducted by the institution. In a letter addressed to the pupil’s father dated 13 August, it states that the school’s investigation had not found the teacher guilty as there was no concrete evidence to support the pupil’s claims and grievances. The letter is allegedly signed by the school’s executive head, Chris Jansen, and Lohann Oosthuizen, learner affairs manager Daily Sun engaged Curro stakeholder management. Spokesman John Smith said: “We request that Curro be given an opportunity to thoroughly and expeditiously conclude this process in accordance with its policies and procedures. We are therefore accordingly unable to comment further at this stage.” Kgetjepe said: “We will make sure that there’s a robust investigation.”
