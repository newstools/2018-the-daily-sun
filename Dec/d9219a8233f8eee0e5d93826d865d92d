PHUZEKHEMISI is facing an attempted murder charge! The maskandi star allegedly shot a band member, who is now fighting for his life in hospital. On Tuesday Phuzekhemisi (55), real name Zibokwakhe Mnyandu, told Daily Sun he almost died when he was shot by people close to him. He said the people took his gun and ran away with it. But the police have a different version of the story. He appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court yesterday. Phuzekhemisi’s face was swollen and his forehead had fresh stitches. His lawyer, Advocate Mduduzi Mvune, tried to prevent journalists from taking photos, arguing it would badly affect his client’s music business, but magistrate Varnita Army granted photographers permission to take photos. Prosecutor Calvin Govender told the court the state did not oppose bail. He then read a statement signed by Phuzekhemisi. According to KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala, Phuzekhemisi and two band members were inside a car in Amanzimtoti in KZN when they had an argument. It is alleged that Phuzekhemisi shot a 35-year-old man in his stomach, chest and one leg. “The man was rushed to hospital for medical attention,” said Gwala. In the statement it was revealed that the musician broke the law by carrying a gun while he was under the influence of alcohol. Phuzekhemisi confirmed that he was the one who had signed the statement. He was granted bail of R3 000 and will re-appear in court on 15 February.
