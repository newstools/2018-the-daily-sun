THE woman filed for divorce, but it appears the husband had other plans. The man allegedly shot and killed his wife (33) and her friend, while the friend’s daughter is fighting for her life in hospital. The man then shot himself, but he survived. He is now in hospital. The incident happened at the wife’s family home in Mabopane block S, Tshwane, on Friday. According to the dead woman’s mum, the couple’s relationship had been on the rocks for months. She said it got worse after the wife served her husband with divorce papers. She said the husband called on Friday, saying he was fetching their three children. “He came and she went with the kids to the car. He took the kids and drove off,” said the mum. “My daughter then walked her friend to her car when they saw her husband’s car driving back to the house.” The mum said the man got out of the car and started shooting at his wife and her friend, who was in her car with her daughter. She said her daughter and her friend died instantly, while the friend’s kid was fighting for her life in hospital. “He came into the yard but we locked the doors. He broke the windows.” She said the man then took one of his kids and went to his house, where he shot himself but survived. “The man had been abusing my daughter for years. That is why she wanted to divorce him.” Police spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi said the suspect was a warrant officer. Two cases of murder were opened. “The couple had previous unresolved domestic violence issues,” he said.
