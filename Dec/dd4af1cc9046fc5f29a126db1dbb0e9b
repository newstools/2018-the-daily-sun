Jeppe police were called to the scene after a man was spotted carrying a gun. When they got there, the man apparently pointed the firearm at them, and they shot and killed him! Jeppe police spokesman Captain Richard Munyayi said the incident happened on Wolhunter Street in Jeppestown, Joburg, on Tuesday. “The suspect allegedly pulled out a firearm and pointed it at the officers. “An officer warned him to put the gun down, but he resisted and threatened to shoot them.” One of the cops shot the suspect and he fell to the ground. Munyayi said paramedics were called but the suspect was declared dead on the scene. A 9mm pistol and a knife were recovered from the dead man. “A case of possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition and an inquest docket has been opened,” Munyayi told the People’s Paper. “The firearm was taken for ballistics testing to establish if it has been used to commit any crime and its originality.”
