A WOMAN and her daughter stared death in the eye on Monday . . . and they survived! Nkhesani Maluleke (41) was in her mud house with her six-year-old daughter Hleketo during a massive storm. Something told the mum to grab her daughter and get out. They made it out just before lighting came down and set the house on fire. Nkhesani, who is from Maphophe village outside Malamulele in Lompopo, said she and her daughter are still traumatised by the incident. She told Daily Sun: “When a massive storm barrelled through the village, my consciousness told me to take my daughter and get out of the hut. “Just a split second after we got outside, lightning struck and the house was on fire. It is a miracle that my daughter and I are still alive. “I thank God for giving us a second chance to live,” said Nkhesani. She lost everything in the blaze. “My clothes, ID book, bed, two refrigerators, TV set and food have been reduced to ashes. The only thing left are the clothes I had on. My daughter’s clothes were also destroyed in the blaze,” she said. She could not afford to rebuild her house, because she was an unemployed single mother of three. She is appealing to SunReaders for donations of food and clothing. “My children and I are facing a dark Christmas. I appeal to Daily Sun’s readers to assist us. “I also appeal to the government to build us an RDP house,” said Nkhesani. Miyelani Shirinda, Nkhesani’s neighbour, said she wished she could have done something: “It is such a pity that I could not do anything to rescue her belongings.”
