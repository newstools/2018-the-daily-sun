SJAVA loves wearing cultural regalia during his performances. But this doesn’t mean he’s a sangoma. Speaking to Daily Sun at the Tshwane All White Jazz Festival on Sunday, the award-winning rapper said wearing these outfits made him take pride in his culture. “I’m not a sangoma and I’m not training to become one. I’m just embracing my culture,” he said. People were worried when Sjava, real name Jabulani Hadebe, took to the stage dressed like a sangoma. Some believed he was following in the footsteps of other celebrities who have answered their ancestral calling. The crowd had mixed reactions about his outfit and dance moves. The Black Panther soundtrack, which Sjava was part of, scored nominations at next year’s Grammys, including Album of the Year. “I’m happy and proud to be in the nominations,” he said. This award is given to the entire album and all its songs. This means Babes Wodumo and Sjava each get a nomination for their amazing work on the album. The album was curated by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. Sjava was featured on a song with American rappers Mozzy and Reason.
