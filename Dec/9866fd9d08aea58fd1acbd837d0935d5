THE mother of two who packed her bags and left home three months ago without informing anyone, has finally returned home. The 21-year-old Zanele Mncwane from Umlazi, south of Durban, who went missing on 29 August, came home on Monday. Daily Sun published the story after her worried mother, Nondumiso Mncwane (50), said she had searched everywhere but could not find Zanele. She said her daughter had left her with her one-year-old and four-year-old children, who also missed her. Zanele told the People’s Paper she returned home after she saw herself in the newspaper. She said she later went to the cop shop to report that she had come back home and was alive. She told Daily Sun she did not leave home because of anything bad. “I was with my friends here in Umlazi’s P section. “I did not have a valid reason why I left home, so when I saw the paper I realised my mother was worried and then decided to come back home. “I apologised to my mother and she accepted my apology. I will never do something like this again,” she said. Nondumiso said she was glad the article was published. “In my heart I had hoped she was still alive. I hoped if she saw the paper she would come back home and indeed she came home. Thank you very much Daily Sun, I really appreciate this,” she said. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed Zanele had come back home safely.
