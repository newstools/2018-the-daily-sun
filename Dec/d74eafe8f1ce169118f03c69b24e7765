HE has worked as legendary gospel singer Rebecca Malope’s backing vocalist for over a decade. Muzie B (36) believes it’s time for him to spread his wings. Muzie B, whose real name is Muzi Xulu, from Nongoma in KZN recently dropped his second album titled Praise and Repentance Second Offering. “The songs were written from the heart. The album is about my relationship with God,” he said. Muzie B, recently started his own record label Gxaabs Music, but there were times when he felt like giving up. “After that spiritual journey I decided to take a step back.” Praise and Repentance Second Offering is his second album following his 2016 Praise In Tears First Offering. “My debut album was a success, considering that I did everything myself,” he said. He said it was not easy but he viewed it as a learning exercise for someone who wanted to grow in the music industry. “I’ve worked with gifted people such as Sipho Mbhele, Lindani Gumede and Orbert Mabuza. I’m going back to my roots and want to remind people that there’s still a place for traditional gospel.”
