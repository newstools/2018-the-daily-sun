WATCH out for fake recruitment agents! That’s the message from Bushbuckridge mayor Sylvia Nxumalo. “The municipality does not use recruitment agents and won’t ask for any payment for jobs,” she said. She said fake recruitment agents were targeting desperate jobseekers and robbing them of their money in return for jobs at the municipality. “Recently, a jobseeker was almost cheated into depositing R2 300 into a scammer’s bank account. “She was lured by a woman posing as an employee of the municipality and promised her a recently advertised position,” said Nxumalo. Municipal spokesman Aubrey Mnisi said municipal job vacancies and posts were advertised in the newspapers, municipal notice boards or the municipal website. “We’re appealing to residents not to fall prey to this scam,” Mnisi told Daily Sun. “The fake recruitment agents, a woman and Mogale, are  are using the phone numbers 063 629 8351 and 082 070 6614 to target unsuspecting jobseekers.” Mnisi says residents must please report any suspicious calls about employment to the nearest police station.
