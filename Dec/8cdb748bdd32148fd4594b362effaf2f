The ANC said it has noted reports of the resignation of
four Directors from the Board of the SABC. The party said it is concerned by the continuing
instability at the public broadcaster. It call4ed on government to ensure that everything is
done to return the SABC to normalcy and its stability is sustained. "We have similarly noted reports that suggest that
the ANC has encouraged some of these Board members to resign.  Insinuations that the ANC is involved in
attempts to sabotage the SABC Board to achieve political ends is at best a
desperate act of scoring cheap political points.  We reject these suggestions with the contempt
they deserve,“  said ANC National
Spokesperson Pule Mabe. He said the ANC has been at the forefront of efforts to
stabilize the SABC and “we have been encouraged by the work of Parliament in
this regard”. “We are under no illusion about the important role the
public broadcaster plays in the life of the nation and the importance of
ensuring and sustaining a stable environment. 
The Board must be given the space to execute its mandate independently
and without fear, favour or prejudice in the best interest of the SABC. “We call on everyone concerned to desist from alarmist
tendencies and politicizing these resignations and allow space for the
Presidency and Parliament to deal with the matter in the best interest of the
country, “ said Mabe.
