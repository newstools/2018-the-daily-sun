THE time for unmarried and mature women to shine is finally here. Miss Bachelorette South Africa is aimed at recognising and empowering unmarried and mature women through philanthropy, fashion and beauty. It was officially launched in Polokwane, Limpopo, last week Friday. The first Miss Bachelorette South Africa pageant will take place on 27 April next year at The Ranch outside Polokwane. Founder Refilwe Mogale said they would focus on unmarried, mature, independent women between the ages of 25 and 50. Refilwe told Daily Sun the pageant’s vision was to see growth in women emotionally and financially. It would also offer them a platform to build businesses and social relationships. “We believe by doing so our models will serve as good models to young girls,” she said. Refilwe said this pageant will be hosted annually. Twenty finalists will be selected and tasked with fulfilling duties for a certain period of time. “One of the most important tasks will be for participants to raise funds for an organisation that deals with abused women called ThyRest.” “The winner will be expected to initiate projects where they teach young girls the importance of financial and emotional independence and about the types of abuse.”
