THREE men are behind bars after residents reported them to the police. They were arrested on Tuesday afternoon at the home of one of the suspects in Northern Cape. Police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Dimakatso Mooi said the men were bust in Magojaneng Village, near Kuruman. Mooi told Daily Sun: “The police in Mothibistad are investigating a case of illegal possession of ivory, precious metal and a pangolin after three suspects were arrested on Tuesday. “The three men were caught in possession of the items at Magojaneng Village near Kuruman. “This came after our members from public order policing, together with the Vryburg K9 unit, followed up on information from residents. “The information given led them to the discovery of ivory valued at R650 000, platinum worth R290 000 and pangolin estimated at R55 000.” The three suspects, aged between 32 and 34 years, are expected to appear soon before the Mothibistad Magistrates Court. “Police investigations continue,” said Mooi.
