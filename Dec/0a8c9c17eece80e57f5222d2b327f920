THE murder of Parks Khaiyane has sent shock waves across Gauteng. Khaiyane, a well-known ANC man in Sedibeng in the Vaal, died in a hail of bullets last Thursday. A source told Daily Sun Khaiyane and two others were ambushed by unknown gunmen after their car broke down near Meyerton, Midvaal, on their way to Joburg. “He had left the EFF and joined the ANC,” said the source. “He was an outspoken man and he knew a lot. Someone wanted him out.” At this stage it hasn’t been confirmed whether the hit was politically motivated or was just a random attack, but sources said he was followed. Speaking to Daily Sun, Sebokeng police spokesman Captain Teboho Lephoto said Khaiyane made a phone call before his death. “The deceased and his occupants were travelling to Joburg when their car broke down. “While they were waiting for assistance, three men ambushed them.” Khaiyane was shot and died at the scene. A woman occupant was raped and abandoned in the bushes, along with Khaiyane’s driver. Before help arrived, the thugs took his car and drove off. “The woman and the two men were left in the bushes.” A case of kidnapping, rape and hijacking was being investigated and no one had been arrested. Kgothatso Masola also posted: “Sad news. Rest in peace, Parks Khaiyane. “We’ll never forget the good and bad things you’ve done for our community.”
