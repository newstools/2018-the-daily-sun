HE is gatvol of people repeating the same traffic offences over and over again! Now the traffic cop has come up with a plan to discipline taxi drivers who break traffic laws. His colleagues said he was making offenders do 20 push-ups to instil discipline in them. They said Principal Inspector Masithela Phandliwe from Bloemfontein believed physical training could teach people discipline, making them obey the law and have respect for others. A video of one driver doing push-ups next to Phandliwe went viral on social media, but the driver managed to do only 16 before he was begging Phandliwe for mercy. He promised not to make the mistake of loading passengers in the wrong place again. The taxi association loved what they saw and said it was about time the driver was punished. A traffic cop said his colleague hated traffic offenders and was passionate about stopping them. “Phandliwe has been complaining that he issues traffic fines to the same drivers for the same mistakes. The major problem is with taxis that do not load passengers at the taxi rank. They stop in the wrong places and block traffic. “Other taxis following the law are losing business and it is not fair.” Taxi driver Thabang Mpotse (33) said he would never break the law again after seeing the video. “I am one of those who hate being in the queue to load passengers. But after seeing the video of my friend doing push-ups, I will never do that again because I am not physically fit,” he said. Greater Bloemfontein Taxi Association spokesman Malefetsane Mpotane said they wanted more punishment for their drivers. “We have given Phandliwe the go- ahead to punish law-breaking drivers. We applaud what he is doing. Drivers are reckless and our cars are impounded. We have been punished for something we did not do. It’s better if the driver feels the heat. That cop is our hero,” he said.
