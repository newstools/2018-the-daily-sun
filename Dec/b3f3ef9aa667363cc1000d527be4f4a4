GRANDDAD Dean Ward (45) was enjoying a walk with a friend
in Finchley Park, Birmingham in Britain late in June. A teenager approached him and asked him for a cigarette. When Dean replied he didn’t have one, the teen viciously
stabbed him with a carving knife. Even after Dean fell to the ground, bleeding from his shoulder
and legs, Dalton-Byrne continued to attack him until a friend of his pulled him
off. Dean’s friend stopped a passing cyclist and asked him to
call an ambulance. Dean bled to death later in hospital. According to the Sun, the evil thug turned out to be Leary
Dalton-Byrne (18). After murdering Dean, Dalton-Byrne went to a friend’s
house, still covered in Dean’s blood. He told his friend: “I have just done an M bro”. His shocked friend recorded Dalton-Byrne giving all the
details of stabbing Dean to death. He later posted the recording on social media. Detectives were alerted to the posts and Dalton-Byrne was
arrested. Despite protesting his innocence, Dalton-Byrne was
convicted of Dean’s murder on Wednesday. Defence lawyer Timothy Raggatt said: “Dalton-Byrne is
someone with difficulties and has a damaged personality in many ways. "To be quite blunt whether he comprehends the
enormity of what he has done is not exactly clear.” Sentencing will take place on 1 February. Dalton-Byrne could face life in jail.
