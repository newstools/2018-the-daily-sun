WHAT began as an argument in a parking lot ended up with
a couple losing their lives and their two young daughters being injured. According to Japan Times, a court on Monday heard about
the disastrous sequence of events which led to the deaths of Yoshihisa Hagiyama
(45) and Yuka Hagiyama (39) on a major expressway in Tokyo in June last year. According to the indictment, Hagiyama had argued with Kazuho
Ishibashi (26) over the way he had parked his car at an expressway parking
area. A furious Ishibashi had then chased Hagiyama, who was driving the car
with Yuka and their two daughters in it. After about a kilometre of mad chasing, Ishibashi
overtook Hagiyama and forced him to stop in the passing lane of the expressway. Ishibashi was attempting to drag Hagiyama from the
stopped vehicle when it was hit from behind by a truck, killing Hagiyama and
Yuka and injuring the children. Ishibashi’s defense team is arguing that he didn’t
actually cause the death himself as he was no longer behind the wheel when the
truck smashed into Hagiyama’s car. Prosecutors, however, said Ishibashi had “a consistent
intention to make a complaint to the couple and the stopping of the vehicle and
the harassing behaviour are considered as a set of actions that can be linked
to their deaths.” A ruling is expected to be handed down on 14 December. Ishibashi has been separately indicted for two reckless
driving cases in which he tried to force drivers out of their cars. He was also
indicted for damaging another vehicle by kicking it.
