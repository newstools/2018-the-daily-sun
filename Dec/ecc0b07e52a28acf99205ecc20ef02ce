COPS are hunting a thug after he was caught on CCTV brutally
moering a woman. According to the Sacramento Bee, the vicious incident
took place late in November outside a pool bar in Napa, California. Watch the footage below! The woman, named only as Audrey, later told CBS San
Francisco: “We didn’t go outside. We flew outside. Like he threw me and landed
on top of me. I went blank, I went black and everything was kind of fuzzy for a
minute. I don’t remember everything.” It is unclear what started the violence, but several
other men armed with pool cues joined in, apparently trying to protect the
woman. One of the men who moered the woman, Juan Rojas, turned
himself over to the cops. Cops have issued a warrant of arrest for James Curtis Faulkenberry,
who is still on the run. WARNING: NOT FOR
SENSITIVE VIEWERS
