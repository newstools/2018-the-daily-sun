THE three Mthethwa siblings from Meadowlands, Soweto, have suffered the pain of losing their sister. And their brother refuses to let them into the family home so they can grieve. Their sister Joyce (60) died of throat cancer on 12 December. Thobile Mthethwa (52) said they were forced out of the family home by their brother and his girlfriend. “After our parents died my brother brought this woman into our home. “She’s a sangoma and we’d sometimes wake up in the middle of the night with the house full of smoke.” Within a few months, the brother started forcing them to move out. “He’d tell us the house was his. He’d say we should get boyfriends who’ll marry us so he could live in peace because he’s the only boy. “Eventually, my two sisters and I moved out with our children, and since then we’ve been moving from one mkhukhu to another.” Younger sister Nomvula (46) said their dad disowned their brother a long time ago, but they still loved him. “All we need is to bury our sister. We can sell the house afterwards.” They called the cops when their brother became aggressive and he was taken to hospital. The 43-year-old makoti said: “There’s nothing I can do to fight this family. “I’ve broken up with the brother and he chased me away. “It’s been a week since I moved out and was told I’d find my belongings outside the house, which I did.”
