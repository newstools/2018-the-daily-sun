MPUMALANGA cops and other law enforcement agencies will work together to tackle crime during the festive season. They have promised to be visible all the time and to conduct road safety operations throughout the province. This came after provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma urged people to be vigilant by taking safety and security precautions seriously over the festive season. He said many people were crime targets during the festive season. Zuma told Daily Sun this was because most people were busy with festive season activities and some were preparing to go on holiday, while leaving their houses unattended. “It is also a known fact that road accidents escalate during the festive season because most people travel to different destinations within and out of the province,” he said. Zuma said due to high levels of alcohol intake at this time of the year, domestic violence and assaults were likely to happen. “While people are at liberty to engage in activities such as partying and drinking, they are advised to do so responsibly and most importantly not to drink and drive,” said Zuma. “Parents and guardians should also ensure that kids are safe at all times to prevent any harm against them,” said Zuma. “The public should also be alert when using ATMs and not to request assistance from strangers. “People should also avoid withdrawing and carrying large amounts of cash. “Stokvel members are also urged to make arrangements with the banks for payment of dividends to individual members to avoid being robbed during this period.”
