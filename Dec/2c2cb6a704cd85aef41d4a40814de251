KHAUKANANI is 86 but puts even young men to shame. Khaukanani Lukhwa of Mukula Village, Limpopo, said his recipe for a long and healthy life is eating healthy food, avoiding booze, doing a lot of physical work and having only one sexual partner. He said he is like a young boy whose age doesn’t stop him from what he enjoys most: farming. Khaukanani owns a large farm in his home village and doesn’t have other people working for him. “I wake up at 4am every day and walk to my farm nearby. “I then walk home at 10am to have breakfast and go back to the farm again. “At 1pm, I go home for lunch and return to the farm at 2pm until I knock off at 5pm. “I don’t use a walking stick because I’m still very strong .” He started farming many years ago after retiring from his job as a bricklayer. “It is my passion and I will never stop doing it until my last day on earth. “Besides getting cash by selling my products, the daily activities on my farm keep me strong and healthy. I operate all the tools on my own. “Family members sometimes follow me to the farm to tell me to come back home, thinking I’m burdening myself. I enjoy it.” Khaukanani, who does not drink or smoke, also credits his hard work as a bricklayer years ago for his long life. “I worked the whole day, building houses, schools, churches and clinics. “When I sit down doing nothing, I feel something missing in my body. I hardly get sick because I’m fit and healthy. “I encourage senior citizens to keep themselves busy at all times to stay healthy.” He enjoys eating fruit and vegetables and avoids meat. “I rather go for fish, mopani worms or dried vegetables. “Booze is taboo and I drink a lot of water every day. We can have a very healthy community if young people do the same.”
