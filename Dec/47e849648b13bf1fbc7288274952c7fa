Nothandolwakhe Mthandeki is stressed that she might be homeless during Christmas. The 48-year-old from Lower Crossroads, Cape Town, lives in another family’s house and they want it back. “I got sick in 2010 and lost my ability to walk. That’s why I’m in a wheelchair.” She couldn’t build herself a shack because of her condition and money problems. Her Sassa disability grant was temporary, adding to her stress. She had applied for one every six months, even though her condition wasn’t improving. “I wish it could be permanent so I can rent a place to stay.” Human settlements spokesman Ntomboxolo Makhoba-Somdaka said the deparment prioritised people living with disabilities. “I’d advise her to contact our help desk and register on the special cases database,” she said. Sassa spokeswoman Lisa Kindo said: “The validity period of the temporary grant can be from six to 12 months.” She said Nothandolwakhe received a temporary disability grant that was approved based on her medical assessment and recommendation by a medical doctor. If she was unhappy with the outcome of her grant application, she could request an internal consideration within 90 days of the outcome letter being handed or delivered to her. “If she’s still not satisfied with the outcome of the internal reconsideration, she can appeal it at the appeal tribunal in Tshwane.”
