COPS have vowed to see to it that people use fireworks responsibly lawfully. As thousands of people flock to shops to buy fireworks, Joburg emergency services has urged residents to be careful. The public safety department has already started citywide operations to check that fireworks sellers comply with by-laws. Sellers who don’t co-operate with the law will be fined up to R1 500 and fireworks will be taken from their premises. “As residents get ready to see 2018 out with a bang, we want them to use fireworks with care,” said emergency services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi. “The law says nobody under the age of 16 is allowed to handle fireworks unless supervised by an adult. Retailers may not sell fireworks to anyone under 16 years of age. “Fireworks are prohibited inside buildings, on farms, at schools, old age homes or hospitals, and within 500m of petrol stations.” To those planning fireworks shows, remember that fireworks are dangerous. “As many pet owners know, fireworks and thunderstorms can cause a great deal of stress and anxiety to many animals,” said Mulaudzi. “During celebrations, people should keep pets indoors, with the curtains closed and the television turned on, to distract the animals.”
