THE DA Women’s Network staged a picket outside the police’s Maupa-Naga offices in Tshwane on Monday. The women called for the cops to fix issues affecting women and children. Team One Gauteng spokeswoman on women Stefanie Ueckermann said they had conducted a survey across the province and spoke to women about what concerned them the most. She said most of them complained about the insensitivity of cops when dealing with gender-based violence cases. Ueckermann said they came to deliver a memorandum directed to the national police commissioner, General Khehla Sitole. They were calling for the police to remain committed 365 days a year in the fight against gender-based violence and not just during the period of the 16 days campaign. “Crimes against women and children are a daily occurrence that is becoming a norm in numerous communities,” she said. The memorandum also called for an overhaul of the police force, for cops to be trained to deal with victims of rape and other sensitive crimes and to rapidly handle rape cases. Western Cape Health MEC Dr Nomafrench Mbombo was also picketing. She said the majority of the abuse against women and children was by people they knew and loved. “Minister Bheki Cele, we appeal to you today to ensure women are protected – not only after they are raped or abused,” she said. Protection and security division commander Major-General Ottilia Moutlane accepted the memorandum on behalf of the commissioner and said he’d respond within 14 days.
