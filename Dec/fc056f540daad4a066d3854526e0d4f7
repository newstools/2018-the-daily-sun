HUNDREDS of Capetonians have started going to the beach. That’s why the City of Cape Town has warned against drinking alcohol. Mayoral committee member for community safety, Jean-Pierre Smith, said: “It’s the common denominator in virtually all our law enforcement challenges over the festive season and throughout the year.” The SunTeam visited Monwabisi beach on Sunday, where people were having fun. “I normally come to the beach with my family during the festive season because that’s the only time I close at work,” said Andiswa Ntsebeza (44) from Ilitha Park in Khayelitsha. “I prefer coming to the beach because we can have fun without using a lot of money.” Lifeguards told Daily Sun the festive season was the busiest time of the year. Xolani Nomdimba (35), who has been a lifeguard for 10 years, said: “The numbers of beachgoers grow at this time of the year, but we expect it to be much higher on Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. “We have to go the extra mile to ensure people don’t drown. The problem is that people don’t listen when we give them instructions. I think those who’re drunk are the stubborn ones.” More than 300 lifeguards will be on duty and the Identikidz project will operate at 14 beaches. Zahid Badroodien, a mayoral committee member for community services, urged caregivers to register their kids as soon as they arrive at the beach. “That way we can ensure a quick reunion in the event that the child is separated from their family,” said Badroodien. He said the project had been running since 14 December and would end on 2 January.
