ESKOM’s dreaded load shedding is again an irritating reality for people in kasis, towns and suburbs across Mzansi. But for the residents of kasis such as Doornfontein, Troyeville, Jeppestown and Kazerne in Joburg, the dark hours have been extended to Saturday! City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena said the inner city power outage would be restored only on Saturday. He apologised on behalf of the city as businesses and residents were inconvenienced. Mangena said this delay was due to the Van Beek oil-filled feeder cable that was damaged on Monday by a third-party contractor. In the meantime, community leaders warned that load-shedding provided perfect cover for izinyoka to cash in on underground cables. Since Following Eskom’s announcement recently that stage 2 load-shedding is now in force, izinyoka have reportedly been seen working day and night to score big on the thick cables hidden below the city’s streets. David Foster from Reiger Park community forum said: “ the underground cables performed a vital role in the community.“If the lights are off, thugs have easy access to steal (underground) cables... they are cashing in.” “Load shedding is being prolonged in other kasis in these areas [and] becausethugs are cashing in,” he claimed. Mangena said the damage done to the cable by a fibre-optic company covers encompassed 20 metres and is located happened in an awkward space to allow City Power technicians to do their work. “City Power technicians will drill the road, cut the damaged portion of the cable out, replace it with a new oil-filled cable and lay the sleeve which the new cable has to be put through,” he said. “Technicians have to make joints between the new cable and the old cable. This is also another time-consuming exercise,” he Mangenasaid. “The station where the cable feeds from will remain off while repairs continue. City Power will keep affected customers updated as and when new information becomes available.” said Mangena.
