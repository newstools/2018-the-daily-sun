The fourth annual Makhelwane Festival is making its way back to the streets of Orlando West, in Soweto. Set to run between the 14th and 16th of December, the festival is a lifestyle event that aims at reigniting the spirit of community while promoting local business. The entire spectacle will take place on an open street of Soweto, Poka Street where residents will open up their homes to be used as venues such as eateries. Revelers can look forward to exhibition spaces, street food, drinks and of course, music. The stage, which will be set up on the street will experience the electrifying performances of Moonchild Sanelly, Femi Koya, Doc Shebeleza, Thasman, BigBoy, Kongisto and Hammanthedude. There will also be several talks taking place in addition to screenings and a wine garden. “We kick off at Lebo’s Backpackers on the 14th of December and then the festival continues on the 15th from 12:00 till midnight on that day and on the 16th. The festival aims to attract tourism into Soweto during the festive season with the #VayaSoweto campaign to experience local food, fashion, art and music - and encourage local shopping - during the festive season,” said the festival’s co-creator, Sifiso Dlangamandla. Budding entrepreneurs, creatives and musicians will be able to showcase their work during the festival, exposing them to potential clients and wider exposure from the media. “This platform was also developed to re-position our townships in a positive light and to dispel the myths associated with Soweto as a tourist attraction. We certainly do that with our offerings! And we are happy to say that with each year the festival gets bigger and better,” said Kgosi Rampa, who is also behind the Makhelwane Festival. Tickets for the festival are R150.00 at the gate or at Webtickets.
