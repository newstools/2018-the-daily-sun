JOBURG Metro police chief David Tembe said the noise made by churches in the CBD was unacceptable. He said besides disturbing the peace, they also connected electricity illegally. He was speaking yesterday at a media briefing where he and Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba addressed the crime issue. They also released statistics of their successes in the month of November. Tembe said they had nothing against churches. They just wanted them to comply with the law. “We’ve been confiscating their sound systems and they would pay R3 000 and get them back immediately. “This time around, they will only get them after the festive season so people can spend Christmas with their families in peace.” For November, Metro cops arrested 821 drivers for drunk driving. The number increased from last month’s 671. They arrested 36 people for public drinking, 40 undocumented people, there were 14 stolen motor vehicles, 13 people were arrested for reckless and negligent driving, while 10 people were bust for drugs. Mashaba raised concerns they had with the justice system nationally and provincially. He said they made arrests but in some cases justice didn’t take its course. “Up to 80 people were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. “Most of them paid R1 000 bail while the whereabouts of the remaining drivers were unknown.” Recently, the traffic cops embarked on an operation to remove counterfeit goods in the CBD. Mashaba said those who profited from these goods had upped their game. “In addition to mass producing fake goods such as clothing and shoes, these criminals have moved on to producing fake medicine, including ARVs and Panado.”
