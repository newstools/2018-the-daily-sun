WHILE Mzansi supports the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transvestite, intersex and queer community, some countries are still against it. That is why the Netherlands Embassy, Constitutional Court Trust and Amsterdam Rainbow Dress Foundation celebrated International Human Rights Day at the Constitutional Court in Braamfontein, Joburg, on Monday. Amsterdam designer Arnout van Krimpen made a 16 metre dress, making it the longest dress yet designed, with the flags of 75 countries where homosexuality is illegal. When a country ends these laws, that specific flag is replaced by a rainbow flag. Eva Polman from the Netherlands Embassy said this was the first time the event was held in Africa and South Africa was the perfect place to host it. Eva told Daily Sun the dress would be showcased in Cape Town today at a panel discussion about community rights. Transgender woman, celebrity publicist and gay rights activist Yaya Mavundla modelled the dress. Yaya, who received the Socialite Of The Year Award at this year’s Feather Awards, said she received an email asking if she would take part in the celebration. “I agreed to be part of this because I look at where I come from,” she said. “Yes, in South Africa we are free and have rights, but those in rural areas are still stigmatised. “The dress is made of flags from countries where being gay or transgender is still illegal.” She said gay people do not choose to be gay but are born that way. “Sadly, some act straight because they fear society. Let’s not do things based on our personal beliefs, but based on freedom. “Let’s allow people to enjoy freedom regardless of their sexual orientation,” Yaya said.
