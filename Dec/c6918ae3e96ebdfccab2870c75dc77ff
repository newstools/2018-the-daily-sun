THESE people had their hands full trying to kill the fire last Thursday. Their neighbours’ houses in Slovo near Mabopane, Tshwane, caught fire after the electricity was switched back on. The power went off during load-shedding and some home owners had already gone to work in the morning. But when they came back they found they had no place to sleep. Three houses and a shack were burned. The residents now blame the incident on load-shedding. One of the victims, Sarah Mkhonza, said she was not at home when the fire started. “I received a call from my neighbours that my house was on fire. When I got there I could not believe it. “I lost everything. Load-shedding has turned me into a beggar,” said Sarah. Another victim, Kgomotso Ndlovu, said she was shattered as she had lost a bedroom suite she wanted to give to her son when he came back from an initiation school. She said she was not home when the fire started. “My kids were playing outside. They also saw the smoke and ran to notify the neighbours. They managed to control the fire from spreading to the main house. “I do not know what I would have done if my neighbours were not there,” she said. Affected residents appealed to the public to help them repair their homes and their lives.
