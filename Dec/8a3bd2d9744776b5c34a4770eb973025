BAROKA FC made history last night by winning their first ever trophy in the top flight by lifting the Telkom Knockout following a 3-2 win on penalties over Soweto giants Orlando Pirates at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, in Port Elizabeth. The teams drew 2-2 after extra time. This was a great achievement from the Limpopo side that was only formed 13 years ago having gained promotion to the professional rank in 2016. Pirates hopes of ending their four year trophy drought went up in smokes during the lottery of penalties when Thembinkosi Lorch missed his spot kick after Thabiso Kutumela and Justin Shonga had also shot wide from the spot. Baroka players Vusi Sibiya, Mduduzi Mdantsane and Thabiso Semenya scored from the spot to write their names on the club’s history books. This was a dream come true for Baroka coach Wedson Nyirenda who promised them success when he joined the club at the start of season. Lorch was hero turned villain as he rescued Bucs from the jaws of defeat in extra time when he cancelled Mduduzi Mdantsane’s goal from a penalty spot. This was after Musa Nyatama grabbed the equaliser in the 57th minute after Jemondre Dickens had given Baroka the lead on the stroke of half-time. Pirates goalkeeper Siyabonga Mpontshane was to blame as he made two blunders that gifted Mdantsane and Dickens goals. But the red card received by defender Nyasha Munetsi in the 40th minutes worsened the situation for Bucs who had the game under control in the first half. Baroka had an underdog tag, they had the best defensive record prior to the final as they had yet to concede a goal in the competition. Bucs only managed to keep a clean sheet once when they beat Chippa United 1-0 in the last 16 round.
