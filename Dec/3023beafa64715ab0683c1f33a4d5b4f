WHEN Nomzamo Zuma (36) woke up one day last week, she thought the toilet had backed up because she could see and smell sewage. But she soon realised it was a burst sewerage pipe outside, and that her yard had been flooded with kak. Nomzamo, who lives with nine other family members in Hostel 1 in Mangaung, said she reported the sewage spill to the municipality. She said she was told they would send a team, but nothing happened. “We breathe the smell of kak every day and it makes us sick. I live here with seven kids and have to constantly monitor them because they want to play outside,” said Nomzamo. “We are forced to keep the windows and doors closed because of the bad smell. It is not the first time. “Even my neighbour has the same problem. “Kak water is running in his yard.” When the SunTeam arrived, kids were seen playing in the sewage- flooded yards. Nomzamo said: “I do not understand. Municipal workers also live around here and they would have seen the problem. Sometimes their trucks pass by, but they do not stop and fix this mess. “It seems no one is willing to help us. I pray they do so before Christmas,” said Nomzamo. Mangaung municipality spokesman Qondile Khedama said they were not aware of the problem. He said they would send a team to fix it.
