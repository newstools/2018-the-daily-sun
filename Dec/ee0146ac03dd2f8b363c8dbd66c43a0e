THEY exhumed her grave last Wednesday and found someone else. “It was a man,” the family told Daily Sun. The corpse they found in the grave was dressed in men’s clothing and buried with a plastic full of men’s clothing. “This is not how we buried our sister,” said Chunku Fuzile (46). Chunku from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, said they were haunted by dreams of their sister crying in the middle of nowhere, saying she was feeling cold and needed a home. Dorcas died in 2007 and was buried at Phumlani Cemetery in Etwatwa. In 2015 her son Mpho (25) got a job and started saving money for his mother’s tombstone. But when the family wanted to erect a tombstone in June, they were apparently told the section was reserved for poor families. “We approached a funeral parlour to help with the exhumation,” said Chunku. “We then asked the funeral parlour who conducted our sister’s funeral for a grave number. “But they have been giving us excuses and this made us suspicious. “We then approached the cemetery, but they gave us an incorrect number.” His Excellency Funeral Parlour managing director Jake Msimango dismissed the claims. He said he lost some of the business records, but it was never his responsibility to keep the grave numbers. Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said: “It’s important for families to be educated about different categories of burials before the burial takes place. “Some sections allow headstone to be erected, while other sections don’t.” Gadebe said it was also important for families to keep grave numbers.
