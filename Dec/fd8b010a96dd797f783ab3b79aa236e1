A MISSING persons case has now turned into a murder
investigation after a Mangaung Municipality employee was found dead in the boot
of her car on Christmas Eve. According to a statement by Free State police, a missing
persons case and possible kidnapping of Seipati Lechoano was reported on 19
December, which prompted an investigation. "The investigation led to a basement parking at Bram
Fischer building which houses Mangaung Municipality where Mrs Lechoano worked.
Her car was found parked and her body discovered in the boot," cops said. "She was found with her hands and feet tied up and
the body had no visible injuries. All relevant role players and emergency
services were mobilised to the scene." Police added that a postmortem will be conducted to
determine the exact cause of death and that a case of kidnapping and murder
will be investigated. The executive mayor of Mangaung Metro Municipality, Olly
Mlamleli, passed on her condolences to the family of Lechoano. "I have been worried by Seipati's disappearance. It
is unfortunate that we discover a cold body. I had hoped that she was still
alive," said Mlamleli in a statement. "As the leadership of Mangaung Metro we share the
same agony that the family is going through." Mlamleli also questioned the security at the Bram Fischer
Building after the discovery of Lechoano's body. "This talks to the strength of our security systems.
I will be convening a meeting with the directorate responsible for cityâ€™s
security for clarity."  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mangaung-employee-found-murdered-in-the-boot-of-her-car-20181225
