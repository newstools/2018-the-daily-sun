SHE was humiliated and beaten, but that’s nothing compared to what police allegedly did not do for her. Khuselwa Mkhwanazi (33) from Newtown in the Joburg CBD was apparently assaulted by her lover. “We were at a party and he started insulting me following an argument,” she said. He allegedly beat her up and left her with a swollen face. She said it was not the first time. “He’s done it before. I wanted to leave him and report him to cops but he’d apologise,” said Khuselwa. She said on the day of the incident, last Saturday, she decided enough was enough and went to the Joburg Central Police Station. But she claimed police wouldn’t help her. “They sent me from pillar to post before opening a case,” Khuselwa told the People’s Paper. “When I went to ask for a case number the following day, I was given one for a case that had expired a long time ago.” She said she saw her boyfriend the next day and called police to come and arrest him, but he was released. “He came to my workplace to show me he was untouchable,” she said. “He parked his car next to my gate every day and laughed when he saw me. All the cops did was push me away.” She accused her boyfriend of bribing cops. Khuselwa said she was very disappointed at the way the South African law worked. “When you report a case they don’t help you,” said Khuselwa. “What do they want? For one to die first?” She said this was the reason why many women wouldn’t report abuse. “The cops don’t care. They care more about money,” she said. Police spokeswoman Captain Lorraine van Emmerik confirmed that an assault case was being investigated.
