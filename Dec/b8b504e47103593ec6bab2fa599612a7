President Cyril Ramaphosa is announcing the new National
Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP). One of these advocates, Adv Shamila Batohi, Adv Siyabulela
Mapoma, Adv Simphiwe Mlotshwa Adv Rodney de Kock
and Adv Andrea Johnson will be named as the new NDPP. In October 2018 President Cyril Ramaphosa invited a number
of legal organisations and independent public institutions to help him identify
and select individuals for consideration as possible candidates for the
position of NDPP. This invitation formed part of the Presidentâ€™s effort to
meet the deadline set by the Constitutional Court to appoint a new NDPP within
90 court days of August 13.
