AT ONLY 10, Songeziwe Magxaza is already an avid reader. And his favourite newspaper is Daily Sun. Songeziwe’s gogo sends him to buy the paper every day. The little boy often ensures that by the time he gets home, he has finished reading the paper. The SunTeam saw Songeziwe concentrating so hard on the paper, he was nearly hit by a car. The grade 4 pupil from Spooktown squatter camp in Bekkersdal, Gauteng is a pupil at Venterspost Primary school in Westonaria. He said he wanted to be a lawyer when he grew up. “My gogo sends me to buy Daily Sun every day after I get home from school,” he said “I read it as I’m going home because I know she will want to take it from my hands. I like reading and it won’t be a difficult task when I am a lawyer, because I will be used to it already.” He said there was not a day that went by without him reading Daily Sun or a novel. “If my gogo forgets to buy it, I always remind her.” His mum, Abongile, said her son liked to read. “He and his gogo like to fight over who can read Daily Sun. “He wants to finish reading it first before handing it over to her.” She said her son also liked playing soccer, but reading fascinated him more.
