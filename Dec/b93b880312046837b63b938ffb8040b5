IN MOST kasis, residents can be seen relaxing outside their houses to stay cool in the scorching heat. But residents of J section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, stay indoors with their windows and doors shut. That is because raw sewage spills out right next to their houses, with kak overflowing like a fountain. The residents told Daily Sun the problem had been happening for several years. The kak fountain burst open last week and they reported it to the municipality, who arrived to fix it – but they made no difference! Nokwazi Khumalo (39), whose house is right next to the sewage spill, said she reported the mess last Monday and workers came to fix it on Wednesday. “But after they left, it started to overflow again. “I called them and reported it again, but they did not come back. Our kids do not play outside any more,” she said. Another resident, Mduduzi Ngcobo (55), said the smell affected all nearby residents. “In fact, when it gets blocked our toilets are affected too. Maybe the municipality should send in engineers to investigate the cause.” Spokeswoman for the eThekwini Municipality Princess Nkabane said they would send engineers to attend to the matter.
