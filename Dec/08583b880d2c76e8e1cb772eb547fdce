LIVESTOCK owners at Edumbe, northern KZN are still shocked after lightning killed 15 cows on Sunday. The owners have called on Co-operatives Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube to install lightning conductors to protect their livestock. One of the owners, Nathi Khumalo (42), told Daily Sun yesterday that he still couldn’t believe that he had lost so many cows. He said he lost seven cows of his own and others belonged to other livestock owners. Nathi said as livestock owners in the area they were concerned about the safety of their animals and want the MEC to instal lightning conductors. He said he relied on the livestock to support his family. His loss was close to R100 000. “We are worried. We have been checking on our livestock every day. Summer always causes problems in the area because it comes with heavy rain accompanied by lightning,” said Nathi. Edumbe mayor Majuba Mavuso said he visited Nkonkotho Village on Monday. He said he spoke to Agriculture and Rural Development MEC Themba Mthembu and Dube-Ncube. They promised to send officials to assess the damage. The mayor said he also asked the department of co-operative governance to install a lightning mast to divert lightning strikes. Spokesman Senzo Mzila said the department would look into the request. He said his department was concerned about the loss of life and livestock in the northern parts of the province as a result of lightning strikes.
