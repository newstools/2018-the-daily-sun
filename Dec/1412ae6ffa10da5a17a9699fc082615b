HE lived with his grandparents and they shared what little they had with their grandson. But according to residents, the 31-year-old man was taking advantage of them and abusing the old couple’s Sassa grant. And on Sunday that came to a brutal end. When the couple from Stinkwater, north of Tshwane, complained to residents, community members tracked him down. Soon enough they found him boozing it up at a local tavern. The mob gathered, dragged the man to a local sports field and meted out punishment with sjamboks and golf clubs. They then dragged him back to his grandparents’ house, handed over the Sassa card to the old couple, and dumped the grandson on the kitchen floor. His gogo found him on Monday, dead, in a pool of blood. Police spokesman Constable Herman Moremi confirmed the incident. “The cards were given back to gogo and madala, but the money had already been withdrawn. “According to the gogo, she heard a sound in the kitchen and went to check. “She found her grandson lying in a pool of blood,” he said. The gogo called the police. “A case of murder was opened. No one has been arrested, but we are investigating.” Moremi urged community members to come forward with information. “We’re following leads in order to arrest the suspects,” said Moremi. “Those who have information must come to the police station.”
