Rapper Ricky Rick is doing the most out here. He was performing at the Gagasi FM Beach Festival in KZN this weekend. During his performance, he took off his pants in front of thousands of fans. On the video he posted on his social media accounts, he captioned: “You Wouldn’t Believe Me If I Told You. THANK YOU Gagasi FM for always supporting me.” Even though some fans criticized the video, some praised it. Ricky Rick whose real name is Rikado Makhado from Kwamashu is known for his wild performances but we were never ready for this one. It seems like he’s having a time of his life and he doesn’t care whose watching. Ricky Rick is one of the most loved rappers in Mzansi. He is one of the new judges on MNet's The Voice SA next to Lira and host Anele Mdoda. The Boss Zonke hit-maker was crowned the Most Stylish Male at the Feather Awards 2018 for his opulent fashion sense. Due to his unpredictable outfit choices, he is no stranger to negative backlash but I never stop his from embracing his style of fashion.
