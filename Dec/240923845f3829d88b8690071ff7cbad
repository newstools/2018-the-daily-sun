GOGO Sara Ngozo’s days of sleeping in a small shack are truly over! The 101-year-old gogo from McKenzieville extension 2, near Nigel, got an early Christmas present on Monday. She received a fully-furnished house that was handed over to her by mayor Mzwandile Masina, and Afribiz Invest chairman Collen Mashawana. After spending her entire life in a leaking shack, she’s now the owner of the three-bedroomed house with a bathroom, lounge and kitchen. The Collen Mashawana Foundation gave Sara R10 000 to buy Christmas goodies for herself and her family. The gogo shed tears of joy when she entered her new house for the first time. “I don’t know what to say. All I expected was a brick house. I never knew it would come with a new bed. “I haven’t slept on a new bed for many years. Thank you.” To make her home look more welcoming, banana, apple, mango, and avocado trees were planted along with a green lawn. Sara will move into her new home with her 70-year-old son and 68-year-old daughter soon.
