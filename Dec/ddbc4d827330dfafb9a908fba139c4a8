MANY kids in the country are raised by single mums. Frida Vesterberg, founder of Project Playground, has urged parents to be responsible and take care of their kids as a way of fighting social ills. For the past eight years, Frida has been helping kids in townships such as Langa and Gugulethu, Cape Town. “I think that growing up without a dad is one of the biggest social ills in our communities. “Uninvolved fathers who disown their kids leave an enormous vacuum in the child’s life,” she said “With boys, they grow up without proper role models and forming an attachment with a male role model, which is very important. Research shows that growing up without a father can lead to depression, aggression and other emotional issues.” She said the issue of absent dads could also hit girls hard. “For a girl it can lead to teenage pregnancy or she may end up looking for love from any man. “I believe girls become vulnerable when they don’t have a father figure who can teach them the values of being a woman,” she said. Veliswa Tyaliti (44) from Langa said: “My dad was never present in my life. This is now happening to my kids. Their dad does not play any role in their lives. “I am forced to look after my children all alone. “Fathers should be involved in their kids’ lives. It should not be only about paying maintenance. “They should also be present and give kids emotional support.”
