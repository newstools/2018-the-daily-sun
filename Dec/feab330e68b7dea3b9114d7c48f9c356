MYSTERY still surrounds the gruesome find . . . Two human legs were found floating in Nandoni Dam, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo. The discovery has left the community in shock and comes days after the disappearance of Uvhona Sikhwari of Magidi in Thohoyandou. Uvhona, a Sars employee, disappeared in mysterious circumstances last week. Community leader Thixedzwi Mamphiswana said they received a report about the missing man and went to his home. “They confirmed the news and we prayed for them. We’re in shock,” said Thixedzwi. “But we don’t have anything concrete and will wait for the family and police to give us a formal statement.” A family member said they were still in shock and awaiting police investigations to unfold. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the discovery came after a search operation by police following Uvhona’s disappearance. After he was reported missing, search parties found his car abandoned next to the dam, with his belongings inside. The car keys were still in the ignition. Ngoepe said at this stage police were not sure whether or not the legs belonged to the missing man. He said a joint search operation by the search and rescue unit and other roleplayers was still under way. “Anyone who can assist us with information on the whereabouts of the victim should contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111, SMS 32211, or visit their nearest police station,” said Ngoepe.
