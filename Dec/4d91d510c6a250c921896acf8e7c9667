THE Eastern Cape Liquor Board is putting the lives of motorists first. The board recently launched a festive season road safety campaign in Mthatha. It was launched in partnership with the departments of transport, police and other partners in the province. The purpose was to make people aware of the dangers of drunken driving. The R61 and the N2 freeway in the province are two of the most dangerous roads. Many lives have been lost on the roads because of people driving under the influence of alcohol. To kick off the main launch for the festive season, the liquor board, safety department and department of transport road safety and the King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality conducted a massive roadblock on the N2 on Monday. The board’s spokesman, Mgwebi Msiya, said it gave them an opportunity to interact with road users and warn them of the dangers of drunk driving. “We are here to encourage road users, especially drivers, to refrain from using alcohol on the road. “We are here to plead with road users to stay sober and vigilant on the roads,” he said. Msiya said their operation was a success and some drivers appreciated the initiative.
