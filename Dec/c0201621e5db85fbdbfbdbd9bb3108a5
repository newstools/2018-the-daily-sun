GRIEVING parents just dodged the shock
of their lives after hotel staff made a dummy of their dead son and left it on
their hotel bed. According to the Telegraph, hotel staff
at a five-star Jamaican hotel had decided to make the dummy of Alex Stephens
who died tragically in 2014 to comfort his parents, Faye and Andrew Stephens. Their friend Karen Baker from
Hertfordshire, England had booked the trip for them as a way of remembering
Alex during the week of what would have been his birthday. Alex died on a holiday with friends in
Spain where they had gone to watch a music concert. Thinking they were being kind, hotel
staff used clothes belonging to Andrew, stuffing them with towels to make it
look like a person. They laid it on the hotel bed holding a
birthday cake and with the words “We miss you Alex” created by petals next to
it. Luckily Karen saw it first and saved her
friends from the trauma of seeing their “dead son” lying on their hotel bed. She told the BBC how horrified she had
been when she saw it. "When
I walked into the bedroom, all I can describe is a dummy body on the bed. "Staff had gone through my friend's
wardrobe and stuffed the clothes with towels to make it look like a body on the
bed. They even put tears down the face and a can of lager in his hand. "I was absolutely horrified - as
you can imagine I was sweating and shaking. We just didn't want our friends to
see it. "I have truly never seen anything
like it. I still look at the photographs now and can't believe somebody thought
to do that". The hotel has since apologised and given
the family a full refund for their hotel stay.
