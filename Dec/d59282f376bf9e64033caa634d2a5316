THEY stole parts of bodies out of graves, ground them up
and mixed them with black soap – all in the hope of striking it lucky with
money! According to Punch, this “money ritual” is what landed
five people behind bars on Monday in Lagos, Nigeria. Cops allege that third year political science student, Victor
Nnacheta (20) started all the trouble. It was he who consulted with two men calling themselves
Islamic clerics/herbalists in Abeokuta, Ogun State in the south of the country. He asked them to perform a money-making ritual for him so
that he would win big when he laid his bets at the Bet9ja shop. He apparently was particularly desperate for money
because his dad had died. Nnacheta allegedly paid them N250 000 (about R9 700) to
prepare their dark magic. The clerics/herbalists - Kabiru Badmos and Nurudeen
Shodaolu – then consulted two men who worked in a cemetery. These men were Olarewaju Jimoh and Mayewunmi Lukmon, who
agreed to dig up skulls and other human parts and give them to the two
clerics/herbalists. Cop Public Relations Officer, Dolapo Badmus, said: “Victor
Nnacheta wanted to become a billionaire overnight. He consulted some
herbalists/Islamic clerics. “The herbalists/clerics hired two men, who work in a
cemetery. The two men were able to exhume dead bodies. The two men confessed
that they gave out skulls, which the herbalists/clerics ground and mixed with
black soap. “In the process, the police got information about them
and arrested the suspects.” The five are behind bars while they await their court
date.
