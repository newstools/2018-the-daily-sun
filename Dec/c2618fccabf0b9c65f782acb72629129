THE prospect of Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates facing off in the Caf Champions League Last 16 round tie tantalises Pitso Mosimane. For a long time, the Sundowns coach has been calling on the local teams to take the Caf tournaments more seriously. And it seems his call has been heeded with both the Brazilians and the Buccaneers into the 2018-19 Champions League group phases. Even Kaizer Chiefs are in the play-offs in the Caf Confederation Cup, needing to beat Vipers of Uganda to advance to the group stage. But many eyes will be on the Champions League group stages draw in Cairo tomorrow. Sundowns are in pot B with AS Vita, Horoya and Club Africain. The Soweto giants are in pot C with Asec Mimosa, Simba and CS Constantine. “I think it’s possible that we could be in the same group (as Pirates). “I don’t think that we will be in the same pot. We’ll probably be in Pot B, and they can’t be ahead of us in terms of points,” Mosimane enthused. “So, if they aren’t in the same pot then there’s a big possibility we will be in the same group. If we are in the same pot, we don’t play against each other. “That’s what we need. Even in the Confederation Cup. Why not? “It’s going to be tough because we’ve now added six games (fixture list). “Look at the North Africans. They always have two teams in the same group stage,” Mosimane, however, cautioned there is still a long way to go before the any of the two PSL sides can reach the knockout phase. “It’s a long way. This is big league football. We will on the flight… in transit, on the road. “This is the marathon I’ve been talking about. If you want to compare, you must compare apples with apples.” For Milutin Sredojevic, the Champions League dream continues. “After six seasons we are in the group stages and with that in mind we shall see who we are playing against after the draw. “We shall see how we approach the group stages. We are playing on two fronts, the Premiership and the Champions League.”
