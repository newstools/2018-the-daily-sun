PATIENTS, staff members and visitors at Dr Yusuf Dadoo Hospital in Krugersdorp on the West Rand received an intensive education session to mark an end to the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children. This year’s theme was “Hear me too”. The public awareness and education took place at the outpatient department and the pharmacy section on Monday. People were taught about different types of abuse and the signs. They said types of abuse included rape, verbal, financial, emotional harassment, as well as child abuse and physical abuse. Mirram Matlala, the operational manager at Tshepisong Clinic, said families should stop calling meetings when abuse had happened. She said: “There is a tendency in our society that when elders become aware that a child is being sexually abused by a relative, they call a meeting. What is there to talk about when the child’s rights are being violated?” Matlala said there were many unreported cases of abuse and urged the community to empower themselves about their rights Karabo Modise, a social worker, said: “Child trafficking is not just a myth – it is a fact. “We need to take care of our children at all times. We need to share quality time with them and befriend them. “The closer we are to our children, the more chances they will report any incident of abuse without fear.”
