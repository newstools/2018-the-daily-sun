CAPE Town City were handed a Nedbank Cup showdown with SuperSport United in the Cup draw last night. But one could spare a thought for Mamelodi Sundowns who have to take a trip to Chippa United in between their hectic Caf Champions League and domestic league schedule. Another all-PSL teams draw features AmaZulu against Highlands Park while Black Leopards will host Orlando Pirates in another standout fixture. The two contested the 2011 final, clinched by the Buccaneers during their treble-winning era. Kaizer Chiefs, however, will have an easier ride against Tornado FC while Bidvest Wits can’t have qualms about facing little-known Boyne Tigers. Defending champions Free State Stars have been handed an easy draw also, tackling NFD side Richards Bay while Bloemfontein Celtic will visit Super Eagles. Yet what would the Nedbank Cup be without upsets and shocks? Beyond the tantalising prospect of knocking over Premiership “Goliath” and causing major upsets, a good Ke Yona Cup run by minnows from the lower divisions teams can bring considerable long-term benefits. Being paired with a Premiership giant is often the different between a lucrative financial ride and early Cup elimination for lower division teams. But what is guaranteed for most of the lower division teams is the massive gate takings, whatever the results.
