THERE was no warning issued for the severe hailstorm that hit North West’s Sun City Resort on Saturday. This was confirmed by SA Weather Service forecaster Tonie Rossouw. Images of the hailstorm at the resort’s entertainment precinct and groundfloor rooms emerged on social media over the weekend. Hotel management said almost 200 rooms were damaged and visitors were evacuated. It said two people were injured after slipping on wet floors and were treated at the on-site clinic before being transferred to hospital. It’s understood the mop-up operation managed to clean up affected areas on Sunday. Rossouw said: “The hail was unforeseen as it happened quickly. “And it was almost impossible to issue a pre-warning. “Severe thunderstorms of such a nature happen more often than we think, especially in open areas.” Rossouw warned about thunder showers in Gauteng, North West, KZN and Limpopo later this week. He said Limpopo and Gauteng could experience hail towards Saturday.
