PEOPLE who’re afraid of snakes will most likely think twice about visiting this resort. On Saturday, a picture of a python at the resort in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, circulated on Facebook. It was posted by a woman called Makie Molefe, who apparently visited the resort at the weekend. She claimed she and others had seen the python swallowing a dog! “I’ve never seen a snake outside the zoo before. I’m still scared. The python swallowed the dog,” she wrote. “We’re not lying. Other people also saw it. You can even ask the managers.” She said the resort owner didn’t seem surprised and said there was another python. When Daily Sun called the resort, a man said he didn’t know anything about a snake. He asked the SunTeam to send him a picture of the snake. “The woman must be blessed to see such a beautiful creature,” he said after receiving the picture. The SPCA has advised people to alert it when they come across such animals.
