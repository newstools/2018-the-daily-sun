ENDUMENI municipal manager Siyabonga Ntuli has vowed to fight his suspension to the bitter end. Ntuli was expected to be formally suspended in yesterday’s council meeting by the new ANC and IFP coalition. He was given a letter last week and asked to provide reasons why he should not be suspended. The council gave him seven days to respond and his deadline was on Wednesday. Ntuli said he would not go down without a fight. He told Daily Sun on Tuesday evening that he was already aware a decision to suspend him had been made. He vowed to fight the suspension and said he was being targeted because he would expose corruption. “The move to suspend me is a strategy to prevent me from releasing the forensic reports we have completed. “In fact, we have four reports that implicate the same officials who are behind the plan to remove me. “I was in the process of suspending people and open criminal charges against them, but they are preventing me,” said Ntuli. He said he laughed when he found out that the person who would be appointed to act in his position was one of those implicated in the report. Ntuli said he saw no point in explaining why he should not be suspended to the people who had already decided to suspend him. He said he was the one who should call council meetings, and didn’t know who had called yesterday’s meeting. IFP regional spokesman Xolani Msezane said Ntuli must go. “He has messed things up by ignoring his duties as municipal manager and getting involved in IFP factions,” said Msezane Speaker Lucky Khumalo confirmed that the municipal manager’s future would be discussed at the meeting.
