“MY husband is in good hands and is recovering well.” These were the words of Ntombi Nombewu, the wife of former Bafana Bafana striker Philemon “Chippa” Masinga. She told Daily Sun they were focusing on him getting better. “He underwent a minor medical procedure at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, south of Joburg, on Wednesday. “We’re waiting for him to consult with doctors and be given clearance to return home to Klerksdorp, North West.” The People’s Paper published this story on Friday after news broke that Chippa had been admitted to North West Hospital. Mzansi rallied behind the ailing soccer legend as he fought for his life. Well wishes poured in from people including former soccer players. Quoted in a recent Soccer Laduma interview, Chippa said: “They suspect it’s something that could affect all the organs.” Ntombi said his health had improved. She told the SunTeam her husband had a intestinal condition that doctors were monitoring. Chippa had complained about stomach cramps and pains for the past four months. “At first doctors said it was peptic ulcers. “After a sonar and CT scans a month ago, it was discovered he had a condition.” Ntombi said her husband was in high spirits and has had strong support from friends, family and fans. “He’s a fighter and will overcome the sickness. “Our church, the Anglican Church, has been keeping him in their prayers and we have faith he’ll recover.” Ntombi thanked everyone who had been praying for her husband. “We’re also grateful to those who sent messages of encouragement,” she said.
