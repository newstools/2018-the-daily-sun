Mzansi superstar comedian Trevor Noah has had a hectic couple of days, so much so that the star has done even more damage to his voice. Trevor was forced to postpone some of his shows a few weeks ago after he revealed that what he initially thought was just a mildly sore throat was actually bruised vocal cords. ICYMI: TREVOR NOAH POSTPONES SHOWS DUE TO ILLNESS It turns out the star had not recovered fully from the bruising and hosting the Global Citizen Festival this past weekend at FNB Stadium took its toll on his vocal cords. As a result, Trevor has again been forced to postpone all his remaining stand up shows this year in order to focus on recovery. The star posted a screengrab of a note on his social media platforms on Wednesday explaining his situation. “I thought my vocal cords were healed but according to the doctor, flying 36 hours and hosting a giant concert in South Africa did not help me. So now if I want to get better I have to take it seriously so that I can perform at 100% on my new tour next year,” part of the note read.
