Hip-Hop club and radio DJ and producer, DJ Speedsta has a new show in the pipeline and he wants to share it with upcoming DJs. The Metro FM broke the news on Twitter this week, calling on all aspirant DJs to send their work to him for a chance to be featured on the show. Speedsta currently hosts Absolute Hip-Hop every Saturday on Metro FM alongside the radiant, Luthando ‘LootLove’ Shosha. His new show, Summer House Party will also be on Metro FM and will debut on Monday, 17 December 2018 and run until 11 January 2019. This is a pop-up show, set up to do nothing but bring fans nothing but good, summer festive season jams. Since the show will be made up of music mixes, Speedsta will need the aid of other DJs and he and the station have chosen to give the opportunity to up and coming DJs. “Please send 20mins clean radio-friendly mixes to mixesforspeedsta@gmail.com if your mix is dope, I’ll play it. (All Genres Welcome),” he shared. But, the good news did come with a stern warning from the Combos Communicating hit-maker. “Please don’t blow me up after you send your mix. If it’s dope, I’ll respond to you & let you know when it’s playing. If I don’t respond, try again. Don’t blow me up! Please,” he begged.
