A SEVERE thunderstorm forced everyone in Ntenjane to run for cover. Lightning destroyed houses and nearly killed some residents of the village in Eshowe, northern KZN. Amanda Mthiyane (13) and Nomcebo Ntuli (17) were injured after they were struck by the lightning on Thursday night. Relative Mbali Cele (25) told Daily Sun they were indoors when the storm started. She said the roof was blown away by strong wind. “We panicked and ran to a bedroom which still had a roof over it,” she said. “While we were in that room, lightning suddenly struck our house.” “This terrified me as I was the only adult in the house with five children. But after a short while the lightning stopped. “I called our relatives and they came to us. We couldn’t stay there so we slept at our neighbour’s house,” she said. She said in the early hours of the morning they took the injured teenagers to an inyanga. “The inyanga gave them some muthi. “They seem to be okay but I’ll take them to a doctor.” Mbali said it was the first time their house was struck by lightning. “All our belongings were destroyed.” Councillor Sipho Dlamuka said about 20 houses were destroyed by the storm. “I’ve contacted the disaster management team and they have started assisting villages,” he said. “I also contacted Eskom because the power supply was disturbed by the storm.”
