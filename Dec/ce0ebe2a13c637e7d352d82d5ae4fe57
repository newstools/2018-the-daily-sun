Former Mzansi president Jacob Zuma joined twitter last week and is already causing ‘isphithiphithi’. On 14 December, Zuma posted a video of himself on his new Twitter account, announcing his arrival on the social media platform. Many doubted it was indeed Zuma and he decided to follow up with another video telling those in doubt that "it is indeed me". In the video Zuma said: “I’m still learning about the sphithiphithi of social media”. He has been posting ever since he joined and has now posted a video of himself playing soccer with kids. The video was captioned: “Someone tell Stuart Baxter I’m match fit”. The video received over 1000 responses, 3000 retweets and 10 000 likes. The former president now has over 120 000 followers.
