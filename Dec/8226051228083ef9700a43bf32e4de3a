ACCORDING to Num, there’s nothing cost-effective about getting rid of 12 Eskom executives. Spokesman Livhuwani Mammburu said retrenching the executives was in preparation to fire those on the lower levels. “We are definitely not happy about this,” Mammburu told Daily Sun. He said the utility was starting with the executives so that when they came to the lower structures, they could say they had started from the top. He said Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe wanted to implement Independent Power Producers (IPP) programme and these executives were standing in his way. Hadebe announced earlier this week that the power utility would cut its executives from 21 to nine so it could be cost-effective, efficient and sustainable. There are now 10 executives who report to Hadebe, and the number will be reduced to eight when IT and procurement are linked to the chief financial officer. Mammburu said advertising the same positions was proof those who didn’t agree with Hadebe were being replaced. “Eskom is spending R93 million daily on the IPPs. This is not sustainable as Eskom will collapse. Num is not against IPPs but IPPs must build their own grid and compete with Eskom,” said Mammburu. Hadebe said implementing the new management structure was difficult. “We have managed to reduce the number of F-Band positions from 21 to nine by way of regrading or combining roles. “The new structure and our strategy sets us on a path towards stability with an executive team refocused on improving operational efficiencies and reducing costs to improve profitability.”
