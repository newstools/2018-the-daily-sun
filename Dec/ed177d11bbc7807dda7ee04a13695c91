THE festive season is here and hundreds of people will be travelling to various destinations. But in Eastern Cape, 36 people have already died in road crashes. According to the Department of Transport, the deaths were from 34 accidents since the beginning of December. More than half of these fatalities were pedestrians. Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana said the disturbingly high number of pedestrians who died put the spotlight on road safety awareness campaigns. She said pedestrians became victims due to blatant disregard of the law, such as crossing the road in prohibited areas such as highways and the problem of drinking and walking. “The contribution by pedestrians to the number of fatalities is very disturbing and undermines every effort the department has undertaken to curb carnage on our roads,” said Tikana. She said the department was extremely disturbed by these figures. “These are more than just statistics and figures – it is human souls we are talking about. We wish not to see any family grieving because of accidents on our roads,” she said.
