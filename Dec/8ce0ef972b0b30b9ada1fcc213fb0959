RESIDENTS were stunned when they saw a big white tent being put up inside the cemetery. Men walked in-between the graves, sprinkling water and burning incense. Residents later discovered the Catholic Church was conducting its annual commemoration of the dead at the KwaMashu Cemetery. But they still had mixed feelings. Some were against it while others thought it was a good idea. A resident who claimed that her uncle was buried there told Daily Sun she was against this ritual as she wasn’t Catholic. “My uncle was a Zion Christian Church member. “He’s resting in peace and now this might end up disturbing him.” She said the ritual should only be done to those who were Catholic. Another resident, Thandi Dube (55), said her brother Mandla Dube was buried there in 1999 and wasn’t a member of any church. “Maybe prayers will help him rest in peace,” she said. A church member told Daily Sun this was their annual commemoration. “This is done in our church every year in November. “But this year we moved the event to December because there were several events in November. “When we visit the graves, the reverend prays for the dead. “The whole purpose is for them to rest in peace,” he said. He said this is done for everyone, even those who were not Catholic. “No one has been badly affected by our prayer. This is not to cause evil but to merely pray for peace.” The church member said no one had complained to themyet.
