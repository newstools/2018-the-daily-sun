A DRUNK man who mocked cops for not finding his drug
stash had to change his tune when they demanded he was strip searched. That was when they discovered the cocaine he was hiding –
under the foreskin of his 4-5! According to ChronicleLive, North Tyneside Magistrates
Court on Tuesday heard how cops were called to a disturbance at a club in the
small town of Manors in the east of Britain. There they discovered James Mason (21) talking to a
security gaurd. Prosecutor Bethany Jendrzejewski said the man was holding
a bottle of Sambuca, "appeared to be unsteady on his feet, his eyes were
glazed and he smelled of alcohol". She told the court: "The police formed the opinion
he was drunk. They were informed the male had been involved in a disturbance
inside the premises and possibly had drugs in his possession." Cops searched James’ pockets but found no drugs. James’ run-in with the cops might have ended right there,
but the drunken man couldn’t resist mocking the cops and swearing at them. James told the officers: "Ha ha, told you I had f***
all on us you mugs!" Jendrzejewski said: "He was warned about his bad
language and told to leave the area. "But he replied: 'I'm going to go back in there and
f****** smash their heads in, the mugs'." Cops then took him to the cop shop for being drunk and
disorderly. On the way there, they noticed James fiddling with his
socks and then putting his hands in his trousers. They decided he should be strip searched at the cop shop. Jendrzejewski told the court: "He removed his
trousers, pulled back his foreskin and pulled a white bag of powder from his
penis. "The defendant was asked what it was and replied
that it was cocaine." James was fined a total of £235 (about R4 180) for his “foolish
adolescent behaviour" by the magistrate.
