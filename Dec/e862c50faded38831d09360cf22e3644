A STRESSED mum flying with her sick baby
was touched to the core by a stranger who reached out to help her simply from
the kindness of his heart. According to news.com.au, Kelsey Rae
Zwick was battling her way on to a plane travelling from Orlando to Philadelphia
in America earlier this month. She was taking her baby for treatment at the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. She had in her arms her 11-month-old
daughter, Lucy, all the baby luggage, and an oxygen machine which her ill child
needs. A man in first class must have noticed
that economy class had too little space for all the equipment and the child
that Kelsey was travelling with. In a Facebook post, an emotional Kelsey
wrote: “To the man in 2D. Today you were travelling from Orlando to Philly. “I don’t know you, but I imagine you saw
us somewhere. I was pushing a stroller, had a diaper bag on my arm and also
lugging an oxygen machine for my daughter. We had smiles on our faces as we
were headed to see Lucy’s ‘friends’ at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “We pre-boarded the plane, got cosy in
our window seat and made jokes to those around us about having to sit by my
yelling-but-happy baby. The flight attendant came over and told me you were
waiting to switch seats. You were giving up your comfortable, first class seat
to us.” “Not able to hold back tears, I cried my
way up the aisle while my daughter Lucy laughed!” she said. Followers on Facebook were clearly moved
by the stranger’s kindness, with one commenting: “Oh wow. That brought tears to
my eyes knowing there ARE good people in the world.”
