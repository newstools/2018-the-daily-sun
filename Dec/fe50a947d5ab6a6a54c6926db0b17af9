SCHOOLS must take bullying seriously. This is the message from Lifo Productions, which held an awareness campaign at Ernest Matlou Primary School in Blood River, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, on Monday. The company staged a No To Bullying play to educate pupils. The play highlighted that pupils harassed by their peers often skipped class, while others failed to concentrate. Founder of the company Mokgobja Maribana said the show was the first of many to come. “This is one of our concerted efforts to curb bullying and violence in our schools. We have come to learn that the long-term effects of bullying go way beyond the surface. Bullied kids tend to lose interest in school and age-related extramural activities,” said Maribana. He said pupils who are bullied sometimes turned to drugs and booze in an attempt to escape the harsh realities of the abuse. “We hope to work with more schools in the province and to raise awareness to curb substance abuse and under-age drinking, teenage pregnancy and the spread of HIV/Aids.” Teacher Felicia Masokameng said the campaign helped their pupils. “Most of our pupils suffer because of bullying and some of them are afraid to come out. “They now know how to respond when they are being bullied,” she said. She said the campaign also warned bullies to stop hurting other children.
