SPENCER Ruvinga (36) used to work as a cleaner at a private company in Joburg. But even though the man from Salema Village outside Malamulele, worked very hard to support his wife and child, he earned only R300 a week. He then started thinking about how to make extra money to feed his family. Spencer told Daily Sun: “I was worried how I would survive and support my wife and child on such small wages. “I decided to quit my job and asked a friend to teach me how to make tables. “He was patient with me and taught me step by step. “After I had mastered the skills, I started my own business in 2002.” Spencer said he could not believe the support he received. People quickly bought up the tables. He said: “I went from door to door selling the tables and they were sold out in half an hour. “I sell them at villages such as Mhinga, Qaza, Matiyani, Maphophe, Josefa and Makuleke. “My customers are charged R200 to R300 a table.” Spencer said on a good day he makes up to R 2000, and on a bad day he takes home about R700. He also sells his products on credit and collects his cash only at month’s end. Spencer’s dream is to have his company registered and create jobs for the youth.
