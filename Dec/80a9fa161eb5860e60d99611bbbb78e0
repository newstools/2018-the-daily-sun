PEOPLE save money at the bank and expect to get it back. Nomusa Rikhotso (30) from Nwamankena Village, outside Giyani in Limpopo, said her Post Office branch was not taking her gogo (80) seriously. They have been going to the branch since Friday trying to withdraw Nyanisi Mdaka’s savings, with no success. Nomusa said they were third in line when they arrived at the branch. “The first person in the line wanted to withdraw R 20 000, the second R 2 000, and we wanted R 5 000,” she said. “The first person wanted to withdraw from a loan company through the branch and did not get the money because her paperwork was incomplete. “We were at the branch the whole day and the cashier told us she couldn’t give us money because she had to first get money from people making deposits.” They went back home empty-handed. Nomusa said she was shocked at how people struggled to withdraw money. “My gogo is now stressed because she wanted to use the money to build the roof of her five-roomed house.” She had wanted to move in before Christmas. Limpopo North East region manager Kitchener Nkosi said: “The client must have been at the branch when there was no money.” He said they’d made arrangements to have more money. “Those who want to withdraw large amounts will be referred to bigger branches. This was made effective yesterday.”
