THE carefree laughter of kids on the bus to school turned to screams of terror when the bus slammed into a truck. Following the loud bang and kids getting tossed about inside the bus, it was a miracle that no one died. The accident happened yesterday on the R511 in Diepsloot, north of Joburg. A total of 38 people were injured. ER24 paramedics and several other emergency services arrived on the scene. They found the large truck on the side of the road on its roof. The bus was found parked in the road a short distance away. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said several kids were among the injured. They sustained critical to minor injuries. One of the critically injured, a man, lay trapped inside the cab of the truck. Paramedics provided critically injured patients with advanced life support. One critically injured child was airlifted by a private medical helicopter to a nearby hospital. The other patients were transported by ambulance to various hospitals. Details surrounding the incident are not yet known. Police are investigating. ER24 paramedics found the light motor vehicle lying on its roof on the side of the road, its occupants scattered around it. “One man sustained numerous injuries and was in a serious condition, while six others sustained minor to moderate injuries. “They were treated for injuries and transported to hospital for further care,” said Meiring. The seriously injured man later died due to his injuries. Police are investigating.
