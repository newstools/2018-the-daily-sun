ROAD workers had the shock of their lives when they came
across a dead baby lying on the side of the road. According to Sydney Morning Herald, the horrific
discovery was made on Thursday on the road from Rockhampton to Brisbane in
Australia. Even more shocking is how the body came to be there.The infant had died and was being transferred by a funeral home. During a driver change, the infant's body was put on the
car's roof. The drivers reportedly forgot that it was there, and the body fell
off and was left behind when they drove off again. The forgetful drivers didn’t realise that they had lost
the baby’s body until they arrived at the morgue. The infant’s family has been informed of the incident and
have no comment to make. A spokesman for Queensland Health said: “This is an incredibly
distressing incident.  "This transport was not undertaken by Queensland
Health but by an independent private funeral transporter. "We have stopped the use of the service. We are
writing to the contractor to ask them why they should not be permanently
removed from State Government work."
