Newly appointed Kaizer Chiefs head coach Ernst Middendorp was happy to get off to a winning start in what he felt was a deserved 1-0 win against SuperSport United. George Maluleka scored the solitary goal of the match on 64 minutesÂ at the Mbombela Stadium on Wednesday night. It was Chiefs last match of the Absa Premiership. The German tactician was happy with his side's performance although he believes that with improved confidence the Glamour Boys will soon be putting in better displays. "I think it's a well-deserved three points," Middendorp told SuperSport in a post-match interview. "In the short period we had to prepare we've seen a good game with a good performance. "We should have perhaps gone a bit more for the second goal in the second-half but overall I have to say it was good and I'm very happy about the performance. The Soweto giants squandered a number of opportunities to double their lead with Khama Billiat the main protagonist, but Middendorp admitted with more confidence his attack would start firing. "I think it was a nice game, let's work on it to get it good on the performance side, this is only what I am interested in, nothing else and I'm very happy."
