DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane says the party has had a tough year. Maimane was speaking at a media briefing after addressing the party’s Team One SA staff at their Joburg election headquarters yesterday. “This year was tough for the DA. Our party was tested in every way over the past 12 months,” he said. Maimane highlighted some of the challenges the party faced this year, including losing Nelson Mandela Bay, keeping the coalitions in Tshwane and Joburg and the removal of former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille. About Cape Town, Maimane said: “If we were to be true to our manifesto and promise to root out corruption and improve service delivery, then we had no choice but to act, even if this meant taking on someone with a good brand and popular support. “We had to put the people first.” Maimane said he had no regrets about what happened this year and how they handled things. He said the party set out principles and would work to stand by them, even if it meant losing power. Going into next year, the DA’s focus is on governing Gauteng. Maimane said even with their challenges, coalitions were still better than the ANC government. And to ensure these coalitions were stable, they had to build onto certain values. A snap poll released on Monday by the South African Institute of Race Relations showed the DA was at 18%, down 5% from September. On a projected 69% turnout, it came out with 22%. Maimane said the results from recent by-elections told a different story and that South Africans had a choice to make in the elections next year. “Their choice is the ANC and EFF’s coalition of corruption and the DA’s record of clean, accountable government.”
