TWO cops were transporting arrested protesters when they were attacked. One of the officers managed to escape, but his colleague was not so lucky: she was hacked with a panga and her service pistol was stolen. The incident happened during a protest by mine workers at Sibanye mine in Theunissen, Free State on Saturday. A police video camera was also stolen. The thugs freed the arrested suspects before destroying the police van. Free State police spokesman Brigadier Sam Makhele said: “In the early hours of Saturday morning, public order police members responded to an incident at Sibanye mine. “Protesting mine workers were allegedly throwing stones at buses transporting other workers. Two people were arrested. The two cops were left behind while other officers chased protesters in a dense forest. While driving out of the forest, the two cops were attacked by about 10 mine workers.” Makhele said one cop managed to escape unharmed, while the other, a 41-year-old woman constable, was dragged out of the vehicle and hacked on her arms with a panga. She was then robbed of her firearm and a video camera. “Mine workers went on to damage the police van and freed the arrested suspects before fleeing the scene. Cases of attempted murder and malicious damage to property were opened for further investigation. The injured member was taken to a local hospital for treatment. She is stable,” he said. Makhele said anyone who might have information about the stolen gun and video camera should contact their nearest cop shop. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Moeketsi Sempe said: “An attack on the police will not be tolerated. I have called on various police units to trace those responsible for the attack on our members.”
