The South African Police Service receives R3.5 billion per year for science and technological activities. The allocation is higher than that of health, new figures show.It is not clear just how the police spend that money, or whether it was worth it. Crime-fighting science gets more money than science activities in the department of health in South Africa, according the latest Survey on Government Funding for Scientific and Technological Activities for 2016-17. The South African Police Service (SAPS) received R3.49-billion in 2016-17 – accounting for 15% of government’s total spend on science and technology. This funding, according to the survey, goes towards information and communication technologies (ICT) for detective and forensic services, among other infrastructure.     The police’s science allocation was more than that of higher education’s (R3.4-billion) and more than double the amount allocated to science activities in the department of basic education (R1.4-billion) and the department of health (R1.2-billion). The majority of the police's science and technology funding went toward forensics, said SAPS spokesperson Major-General Sally De Beer, though she was unable to give a breakdown as to how it was spent.
