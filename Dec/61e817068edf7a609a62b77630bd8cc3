THE festive season road safety campaign is in full swing in Ekurhuleni. On Tuesday Metro cops held a roadblock on Snake Road and Dube bridge. They stopped 204 vehicles and 19 drivers with outstanding warrants were caught. Ekurhuleni Metro cop, spokesman Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said the 16 drivers paid contempt of court fines on the spot, while three were bust. “Twenty-nine motorists who were made aware of their outstanding fines decided to pay on the spot before their fines gave rise to warrants. “A total of R22 800 was collected between 9am and 12pm.” Kgasago said about 56 drivers were bust for driving under the influence of alcohol. “The Friday operation in Daveyton resulted in two arrests and police were forced to stop the operation due to rain,” he said. The operation yielded 17 arrests on Saturday in Kopie Motebang and Eisselen streets. “On Sunday 21 drivers were arrested at the intersection of Ndudula and Sonneskraal streets. “The Monday operations yielded 16 drivers at Nala and Sonneskraal streets. “All 54 arrestees ranging between 25 and 40 in age were detained at the respective police stations,” said Kgasango. “They’re expected to appear in the Daveyton and Nigel magistrates courts soon.”
