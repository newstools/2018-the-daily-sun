FROM next week, about 100 cops will have nowhere to live. The cops, who live in police flats in Durban, were served with letters of notice that they should vacate the flats by 26 December. At a media briefing urgently called by the South African Police Union on Wednesday in Durban, the union lashed out at provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi. The union’s provincial secretary Nurse Mdletshe said they were angry and concerned about the decision to evict officers. She said Mkhwanazi as the employer treated officers as if they had invaded the flats by force. “We have been trying to talk with the provincial commissioner, but it seems he is not interested in hearing what we want to say,” she claimed. “This situation will affect the morale of our members, who have to focus on fighting crime during the festive season. We have asked Mkhwanazi to give all our affected members transfers to work near their homes, but he refused. Our lawyer wrote to him last week, but he never responded.” She said if management continued with the eviction, the union would be forced to go to court. Cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said police personnel living in the building had no legitimate right to be there as they had retired, while some were dismissed, but refused to leave. She said the state had no obligation to look for an alternative place.
