WORKING as a mechanic for many years gave Sydney Mphela the skills he needed to earn a salary as an independent insurance assessor. While Mphela is happy to be working as a car assessor for the city of Ekurhuleni, he has other dreams. Mphela’s love of cars comes from when he was a schoolboy in Soweto. He would design, build and sell wire cars. He collected lots of beer and cool drinks can. The cans were made into a skin over the wire frame so he could sell them at a higher price than the plain wire-frame cars. “The more people who loved what I was doing and the more money I made, the greater my love for motoring grew.” After school, his passion for toys steered Mphela into studying mechanics and panel beating at a Soweto college. It was his many years at various mechanical and other businesses that he gained invaluable experience. Mphela’s skills allowed him to be employed as a car assessor by the city of Ekurhuleni three years ago. It’s where he works to this day. But Sydney is restless. He dreams of expanding the panel beating business he opened eight years ago. “In order to expand my business I need to buy machines that are able to do the quality of work I require. “I work as an independent insurance assessor to save money to afford the equipment I need but it’s slow. I am also looking for government or private investors to help me out.”
