WIDOWS of miners who were shot and killed by police at Marikana dread Christmas time. Not only does it remind them of their loss during the the 2012 massacre, the widows have still not been compensated. Now a group of about 15 residents from Marikana near Rustenburg, North West, are walking to the Union Building in support of the widows. They said the best Christmas gift President Cyril Ramaphosa could give the widows and other victims of the massacre would be to compensate them, as government did with the Life Esidimeni victims. “We also want him to give 8% of the mines’ shares to the communities who reside in those areas,” said activist Napoleon Webster. “The mining towns are slums and don’t get development while mines make billions in profits. “As a former leader in the mining sector, the president should understand the issues better, and address them.” Another community leader from Forum for Service Delivery, Katlego Motlagodisa, said the president would do well to donate his own 8% Lonmin shares to the widows. “This could mean a lot for him and the victims. “He could help them register a community property association or co-operative to control the shares, and use them for their benefit.” The group consists of people from Sondela, Zinniaville and other areas from Rustenburg. They prepared a memorandum to give to the president today. The group started walking on Sunday night, and expect to be in Tswane tonight. Ramaphosa told MPs in February this year that compensation payouts would be finalised “within the coming months”.
