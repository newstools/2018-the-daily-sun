BONISILE Mtshali (38) is relieved that her four young relatives were not hurt when their house caught fire. But the flames ate all her belongings! Bonisile told Daily Sun she left her three kids, aged between four and 15, and their cousin (12) in the house on Friday when she received a call that her mum had been hospitalised in Vryheid. “I told them I had to rush to check up on their gogo and that I’d be back on Monday,” said Bonisile, who’s from Mdonga Village in Newcastle. On Sunday, she received a call from a neighbour, telling her about the incident. “The neighbour told me they suspected the fire was caused by the force with which electricity came back on.” There had been load shedding the whole of Sunday. The kids noticed smoke coming from the kitchen while watching TV, and they rushed out to call the neighbours. By the time they returned with neighbours, the fire had eaten almost everything. She lost a wardrobe full of family clothes, TV, beds, cupboards and groceries, as well as building material she had bought to extend her house. “The fire has buried me alive,” said Bonisile. “It took me a very long time to save money to buy all these things that were damaged by the fire. It makes my heart sink.” She took her relatives from Newcastle to Vryheid as they were left with nothing.
