A DODGY landlord is in hot water after being bust with
videos of his tenants, secretly filmed with spy cameras he installed in their
flats. According to news.com.au, James “Tiger” Maxwell (49) was
born in Barbados but had been working as a property manager in Australia for a
decade. On Wednesday he appeared in a Sydney court to answer to
11 charges of intentionally recording intimate images without consent. Maxwell apparently hid the cameras in two bathrooms and a
couple’s bedroom. He had a special app on his phone which let him watch the
footage as he jetsetted around the world. He was bust when one of his tenants discovered one of the
hidden cameras. Some of the cameras were hidden in very strange places,
like inside a digital clock. He apparently has about 50 videos of his occupants. His lawyer said he would be pleading guilty to the 11
charges, but more are expected to be laid against him in early January when his
case resumes.
