SPEEDSTERS come up with bizarre excuses when they are bust. According to Ekurhuleni Metro police spokesman Wilfred Kgasago, some people didn’t give reasons, while others claimed they were rushing to the airport, church or hospital – or that their children were sick. Kgasago said since the start of the festive season, they had arrested 29 people driving BMWs, Golfs, Polos and Toyota Quantums. He said they also had an old Ford Escort ST caught driving 210km/h in a 120km zone, as well as a Porsche and McLaren. “One of the BMW drivers we arrested told cops he was testing his new vehicle,” he said. Metro police spokeswoman Sergeant Tessa Adams said the driver was rushing home from work. Later on the same road, a biker on a Ducati clocked 192km/h. He was rushing to Lenasia and claimed his child was sick. Another Merc driver was bust on the N14 for driving at 195km/h on Tuesday. He said he was on his way to Cape Town to see a doctor. He then said he was late for a flight.”
