THE festive season is known for attracting thugs. To see the readiness of cops in Limpopo, Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the province yesterday. His visit came after 117 suspects were arrested this week in various parts of the province. They face charges of armed robbery, housebreaking, attempted murder, possession of stolen property, and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Cele joined cops as they conducted roadblocks on the N1 and R71. He ordered traffic cops to discontinue three unroadworthy cars with expired licence discs. All three cars were travelling from Gauteng to Zimbabwe. “This is not a car but a moving coffin. How can you even load a child inside a coffin and move on our roads? “Even cows have papers to identify them, but you are moving around without papers. You must enjoy your Christmas and warm water in the cells,” said Cele. Transport MEC Makoma Makhurupetje said BMW and VW drivers gave her a headache and did not follow road rules. After the roadblock, the MEC and minister visited Limpopo Mall and taxi centre to interact with shoppers and commuters. Cele said cops in Limpopo were ready to fight crime and had the best intelligence team.
