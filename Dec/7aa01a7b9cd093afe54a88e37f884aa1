HAVING broken his duck at Highlands Park when he scored the second goal in their 2-0 victory over Cape Town City FC at Makhulong Stadium last weekend, Tendai Ndoro has regained some self-belief. He has put his Ajax Cape Town troubles behind him and is looking to continue his PSL career with the slate wiped clean. His switch to the Lions of the North, which caused a big mess at Ajax, has been like a breath of fresh air, he says. The former Orlando Pirates forward is one of the senior players leading a youthful team coached by Owen Da Gama. The 32-year-old caused a stir when he was fielded for Ajax, having already played for Pirates and Saudi Arabian club Al Faisaly, breaching Fifa rules. But now Ndoro is determined to make a telling contribution for the rookies. “We have lots of youngsters carrying the team,” he said. “For me the team comes first and I will do my best to help the young players do well.” Regarding his return to action, Ndoro said he was a happy man and looking forward to making headlines for the right reasons on the field of play again. He said: “The timing is perfect. I’m happy to be playing again – I didn’t get a long ban. “I just want to thank the Almighty for being good to me.” He stressed that he would like to put the whole saga behind him and focus on his football.
