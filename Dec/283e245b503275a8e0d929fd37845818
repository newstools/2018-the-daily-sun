Sierra Leone has been disqualified by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) from the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers with all their points in matches annulled. This would leave Ghana to qualify for the tournament that might be held in South Africa after the continental football body took the hosting rights away from Cameroon.South Africa is now waiting for government's approval, even though Sport Minister Tokozile Xasa, has accepted in principle while interviewed on television on Sunday.Caf extended an invitation to the SA Football Association (Safa) to "seriously consider" jumping in as an urgent saviour to the situation after Cameroon was deemed not ready for the tournament kicking off in June next year.Yesterday Caf, in a statement, considered the Sierra Leone situation after being banned by Fifa in October following claims of government interference - and African football body rubber stamped it.Fifa does not approve government to interfere in football matters, hence they turn red-faced in case a football matter is taken through to the courts of law.Fifa's banning of Leone Stars leaves Kenya leading Group F with 7 points from three matches, followed by Ghana with six and Ethiopia with a single point.This would mean Ghana will find their way to Mzansi should Safa president, Danny Jordaan, get his dream of being host to the tournament.Safa reported a loss of R18 million that was accrued "mainly due to the protracted broadcasting contract rights involving SABC".Jordaan, during Safa's annual general meeting (AGM) at the weekend, reiterated his call this year that they had made a bid for the 2023 for the Fifa Womenâ€™s World Cup.Banyana Banyana qualified for the 2019 Women's World Cup to be held in France on 7 June to 7 July.
