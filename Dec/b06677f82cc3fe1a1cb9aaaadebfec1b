SESHEGO kasi in Limpopo, including Seshego Circle Centre Mall, was totally shut down on Monday. Seshego Concerned Community was protesting over the allocation of stands in extensions 78, 133, 127 and 126 by Polokwane Municipality. It also wants wrongful billing to be cancelled and the municipality to stop outsourcing private companies to maintain basic municipal structures. The group’s leader, Matome Ramabu, said the march could not be properly addressed because they were intimidated by police. A large number of public order police were sent to the mall to monitor the situation from 3am, as 2 000 people were expected to march. Shop employees and shoppers were stranded outside the mall after all the gates were closed. Ramabu said they handed out notices to shop managers around the kasi and to mall management to avoid vandalism at the centre. “We did not want our names to be tainted with hooliganism. “We gave them notices to warn them of the shutdown and that it would be up to them to close shop or stay open. “They [municipality] have trained people who can easily do these jobs, but they are still outsourcing. “They should maintain the infrastructure, as they have trained people to do so,” Ramabu said. Isaac Choshi, a manager from the office of Polokwane mayor Jeneffer Malope, received the memorandum from Ramabu. Choshi said: “We will have a meeting and discuss their grievances and respond to their memorandum within the seven days’ notice they gave us.”
