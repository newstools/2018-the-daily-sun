HOME Affairs in KZN has warned people to collect their new IDs before they are destroyed. Provincial spokesman Cyril Mncwabe told Daily Sun people who applied for their IDs in the past three months must collect them by the end of January. Mncwabe said there were more than 50 000 uncollected IDs that had piled up in various Home Affairs offices across the province. He said if an applicant failed to collect their ID, they would have to pay R140 to reapply for a new one. “After a certain period, uncollected IDs have to be taken back to the head office where they will be destroyed. “And when an applicant comes back and reapplies, then they have to pay as it cost the department to make the ID. “We call on everyone who has not collected their ID to come forward,” he said. Mncwabe said the department always sent out SMSes to notify applicants when their IDS were ready. The problem was that when applicants changed their contact details, they failed to go to their offices to update their information. “We send SMSes to numbers that do not exist and applicants end up not knowing their documents are ready. “This is one of our obstacles and we do not know how we can overcome it. We can only plead with applicants to come and update their information.” Mncwabe said they would extend their working hours from 2 January. “This is to accommodate even those who complain they don’t get time to come to our offices. “We’re going to open from 7am to 6pm until the end of voting registration dates, which are 26 and 27 January. “Then after that we will return all uncollected IDs back to head office,” said Mncwabe.
