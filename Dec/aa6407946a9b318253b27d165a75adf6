LAW enforcement will come down hard on all reckless drivers. KZN MEC for transport, community safety and liaison Mxolisi Kaunda said this on Sunday after visiting the sites of two crashes where 22 people lost their lives on Saturday. The first crash, which happened at Appelsbosch near Bhamshela, claimed the lives of seven people when their car collided with a bakkie. The second crash happened in Empangeni near Enseleni, killing 15 people. Kaunda said they were committed to reducing road crashes and fatalities by more than 10% this festive season. “We are going to clamp down on drinking and driving, speeding, unroadworthy vehicles and unlicensed drivers. We will win the battle against crashes if we work together. “Road crashes should not be part of our lives. Let us join hands and make sure each one of us abides by the rules of the road.” Kaunda also visited the crash survivors at Ngwelezane Hospital. He said the government would ensure that all the people who died were given a dignified burial. “The Department of Transport will send a team of engineers to conduct an assessment along the stretch of road to see if more safety measures are needed,” said Kaunda.
