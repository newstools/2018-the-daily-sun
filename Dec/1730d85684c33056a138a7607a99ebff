THE Day of Reconciliation means something different to many people. President Cyril Ramaphosa said people should not only look at the country’s apartheid past, but also at the legacy of centuries of historical injustice. He was speaking in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, on Sunday. Ramaphosa said: “We should not just see it as a day where we talk about reconciliation without giving content. “We can’t be a reconciled nation as long as the majority of South Africans continue to suffer the injustices of the past.” Before his address, he officially opened the Ncise Rural Agro Finance Initiative. He said the Eastern Cape should feed the nation as a whole. “The province is not just the home of legends, but has the potential of being the food basket of South Africa,” he said. He was speaking in Eldorado Park, south of Joburg, as part of the party’s Day of Reconciliation celebrations.
