THE annual Sasol National League Championships have always been the best scouting cave for South African female coaches in football. The coaches have unearthed a lot of unmatched talent during the games and most of them have gone all the way to represent the country in different women’s national teams – Bantwana, Basetsana and Banyana Banyana. However, this year Banyana assistant coach, Thinasonke Mbuli, who has been monitoring the progress at the games, is hoping to grab another star in the tournament that started on Tuesday at Galeshewe Stadium in Kimberley. “It’s disappointing,” said Mbuli, who is representing Banyana head coach Desiree Ellis. Ellis could not attend this year’s tournament as she left Mzansi yesterday to attend the Fifa Women’s World Cup draw, which will take place in France tomorrow. Banyana qualified for their maiden world showpiece in Ghana last week. In last year’s championship in Mpumalanga, four players – Melinda Kgadiete, S’duduzo Dlamini, Neliswa Luthuli and Kgaelebane Mohlakoane – were selected and made national team debuts. Since then they never looked back and are now regulars in the Banyana team. Mbuli stated: “Honestly we haven’t seen much. There’s no player that has been outstanding. It’s disappointing there’s nothing really special that we have seen, something that would make us say, wow! “I don’t know if it’s because of stage fright as only three teams were here last year. Most of them are new they have not been part of this tournament in a while.” But the former Banyana player is hoping they will get something before Sunday when the finals will be played. She commented on disappointing Bloemfontein Celtic Ladies: “Celtic are not the team we have seen in the past two years. We expected more from them with the quality they have.” TUT continued with their fine display when they came from a goal down to claim 2-1 victory against Golden Ladies to secure a semi-finals place scheduled for tomorrow. The final will be played on Sunday.
