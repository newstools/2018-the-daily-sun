A COP and her husband were shot dead in their house in Agincourt near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Saturday. Sergeant Thembekile Ndlovu (42) and her husband, Jabulani Khoza (40) were woken up by men trying to gain entry through the couple’s bedroom window at about 4am. There was a shoot-out and Thembekile, who worked at the Calcutta cop shop in Mkhuhlu, managed to shoot dead one of the suspects. The two other suspects fled in her car, leaving the couple in a pool of blood. When the SunTeam arrived at the scene, there was blood flowing from the couple’s bedroom. Jabulani’s brother, Arnold Khoza (46) told Daily Sun they were woken up by gunshots from the couple’s home. “We called Jabu and his wife, but both their phones rang unanswered. “We could not believe our eyes, seeing one of the thugs lying dead in the doorway,” said Arnold. “Thembekile was lying dead on the bed with her pistol still in her hand,” said Arnold. Jabulani could speak to us, but with difficulty. He said there was a commotion after one of the criminals shouted at him from the window instructing him to lie down on the floor before they started the crazy shooting. We rushed him to the clinic, but he unfortunately died there while waiting for an ambulance.” Neighbour Freddy Mbhandze said: “Angry residents demanded the thug’s body, so they could set it alight.” Police spokesman Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said they were looking for two or more suspects who were responsible for killing the sergeant and her husband. He said one suspect aged 28 had been shot dead. “The car was later recovered abandoned within the vicinity of Bushbuckridge. We have put in motion the 72-hour activation plan and have mobilised all our resources to ensure the perpetrators are brought to book soon,” said Bhembe. He said two counts of murder and inquest have been opened. Anyone with information relating to the incident can contact Lieutenant-Colonel Nomsa Mkhwanazi on 082 469 1250 or Mhala Police on 013 773 0331.
