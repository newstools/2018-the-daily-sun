Someone close to the Shobas tried to cast a spell to bring them financial and personal trouble. But luck was not on the evildoer’s side. The Klipspruit-based family called a sangoma to undo the damage. They found a dead snake with a R10 bank note on top, a needle, and a small white paper smeared in muthi at a corner of their house on Saturday. This was after they fought a featherless chicken smeared in muthi, with its legs tied together, the previous night. They were told the snake would cause trouble in the family and the R10 would create money struggles. They said the sangoma revealed the person behind the evil was someone they knew. After being protected, they said they were ready for any muthi that might be thrown their way. Uncle Themba Shoba (66) said: “Around 10pm on Friday, I was shocked to find a featherless chicken smeared in muthi. We tried to chase it away, but it refused.” They gave up in the early hours of Saturday and in the morning it was gone. “On Saturday morning, we heard my sister screaming and we rushed outside. “There was a dead snake lying there. The family consulted a sangoma as this was getting too much.” Sangoma Dungamanzi Nyoniyasemanzini said the evildoer was a relative.
