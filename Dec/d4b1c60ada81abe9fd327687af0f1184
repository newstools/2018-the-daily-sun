Fitness guru Sbahle Mpisane recently spent a day with former President Jacob Zuma’s wife Tobeka  Madiba-Zuma. The 26-year-old who was recently discharged from hospital following a horrific car crash which left her unconscious and in ICU, seems to be well on her way to making a full recovery. “Had an amazing day with @Tobeka _madiba_zuma, blessed with happiness and peace of mind,” she captioned a snap of Tobeka alongside her daughter Nqobile. “It amazes me how one positive talk with Mum Zuma is yet to change a few of my days. I love you and Nqobile with all my heart.”
