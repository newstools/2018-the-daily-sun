DEPUTY Minister of Public Service and Administration Chana Pilane-Majeke visited Gugulethu on Wednesday. She spoke to residents as part of 16 Days of Activism For No Violence Against Women And Children. The meeting was held at Gugulethu Sports Complex. “Communities need to prepare themselves and always be cautious because abuse happens right under their noses,” she said. “We must tackle abuse 365 days, because women and kids are being abused almost every day.” She said there should not be any woman killed while having a court order, otherwise harsher sentences were needed. MP Mandisa Matshoba said government needed another plan because a lot had been done, but the results were the same. “We can’t keep having these events without seeing any difference, because women and kids are still being abused regardless of countless attempt to try and find a solution.” Gogo Nomlindelo Saweni (67) said government officials only cared about abuse at this time of the year. “Why can’t they do this every day to show that they are committed to solving the issue of abuse?”
