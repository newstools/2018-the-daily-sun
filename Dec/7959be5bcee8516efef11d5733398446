WHEN the Kekanas started suspecting an evil person wanted them to struggle in life, they knew they had to bring in the big guns. And on Tuesday, they got sangoma James Chuma (43) from Sudan to perform powerful rituals to rid them of the dark cloud hanging over them. The sangoma performed a ritual with a white chicken, which revealed there was muthi hidden in one of the bedrooms in the family home in Moshate Village, outside Mokopane in Limpopo. He also found a baboon’s hand buried in the family garden. Chuma slit the chicken’s throat with his teeth and threw the head on the ground. He was then directed to the hidden muthi. More muthi was found under the bed in Sphiwe’s bedroom. It was covered in black plastic. The sangoma said the muthi was put there to make sure no one in the family ever found success. Mum Velamina (50) said she believed her children would finally be alright as the curse on her family had been lifted. “Now I know why things were difficult for all of us,” she said. “I want the muthi found here today to be sent back to the people who wanted to harm me and my family.” Sphiwe said it was scary to see the muthi being removed from his bedroom. He said he had no idea it had been planted under his bed.
