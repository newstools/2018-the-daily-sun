SOUTH AFRICA has the largest number of HIV-infected people on ARV treatment. This was announced at a media briefing by the Human Sciences Research Council (HRSC) and UNAids in Tshwane on Monday. HIV drug resistance is also a concern, according to results from the fifth South African National HIV prevalence, incidence, behaviour and communication survey. It was conducted in 2017 by the HSRC and its partners. It found resistance to antiretroviral drugs in more than a quarter of virally unsuppressed people living with HIV. Resistance to ARVs was identified in 27,4% of survey respondents who were virally unsuppressed. Drug resistance was found in 55% of respondents on treatment and not virally suppressed and in 75% of those who had stopped treatment. Resistance was also found in 15% of respondents who reported no previous exposure to ARVs and their levels of drug resistance were the same among males and females and children aged 0-14 years and youths aged 15-24 years. The survey included those who may have stopped receiving care and those accessing private sector care. One of the principal investigators, Dr Sizulu Moyo, said this was the first South African HIV household survey to include HIV drug resistance testing. “It provides information that would not be provided by regular HIV drug resistance survey that use information from public sector clinics,” she said. Another researcher, an expert on HIV drug resistance from National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Dr Gillian Hunt, said the research showed that high numbers of patients who were no longer in care had heightened resistance. She said the information supports efforts to keep patients in care, to switch failing patients to alternative regimens more quickly and to switch introduce Dolutegravir based regimens in to the national treatment programme.
