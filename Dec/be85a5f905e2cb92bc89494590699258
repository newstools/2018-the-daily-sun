THE family of Kgomotso Seleke is devastated. The 11-year-old boy died after drowning in a sewage dam near his home in Mothutlung, North West. Kgomotso and his friend were playing at the sewage plant on Friday when he slipped and drowned. His mum Francinah (30) said she was at work when the incident happened. “I rushed to the scene after I was called by one of my neighbours. I found people there, searching for him,” she said. She said it was too late when Kgomotso was found on Saturday. “Seeing my son like that hurt me deeply,” she said. Francinah said the plant was abandoned and wasn’t secured. “I don’t know why the children were playing there. That place is dangerous. “Some community members damaged the fence a while ago during a protest, so it isn’t safe.”she said. She said she was glad his body was at least found. “Even though it’s painful that he died in this manner, it would have been more painful if we could not bury him. Now that his body has been found, at least we’ll find closure knowing where his final resting place is.” She said the municipality must take action and pay for her son’s death. “They knew about the problem at the plant. It has been abandoned for a long time and they’re not doing anything about this,” she told Daily Sun. Madibeng municipal spokesman Tumelo Tshabalala said: “We’re deeply hurt by this death, which could have been avoided. And, as such, we share the family’s pain.” She said community members had violently removed the security on site. “We believe the cause of vandalism has got nothing to do with service delivery,” he said. “In one of the meetings held with the group, they demanded that everyone working at the plant should be from their area. We wish to make an appeal to communities not to resort to violence or vandalism for their concerns to be heard.” Captain Aafje Botma said an inquest docket was opened.
