SADDAM is a street hustler and you can call him Macala. The charming thug is played by Sayitsheni Mdakhi from Emdeni, Soweto. Saddam is the clean-up guy who takes care of the mess caused by his boss Judas Ngwenya’s family on Isibaya. Saddam started as a debt collector, selling dagga in Orlando, and later became second-in-command to Judas. This 39-year-old actor said his character is based on many Saddams out there. “I understand the ganja business. I grew up with people who smoked and sold it. “I was inspired by Menzi Ngubane as Mazwi on Ubambo Lwami.” Sayitsheni said Saddam’s character has changed from being a thug to being romantic. Saddam is in love with Lillian, played by Linda Sebezo. “Saddam is a sucker for love with a weak spot for older women. I draw my chemistry by looking at Linda’s beautiful eyes and the way she laughs.” Saddam likes her voice and body. “I remember our first scene, when I said “Unyathela ngabantwana. (You have sexy legs),” said Sayitsheni. Sayitsheni grew up knowing that the idea of a Ben 10 and a sugar mama was wrong. He worked as a flight attendant for a decade and later on as a teller. He has a diploma in IT from the University of Joburg and majored in programming. As a student, he played the role of a drunken man in a church in the play Can I Get Amen?, directed by Gamakhulu Diniso. Last year, he did bigger productions such as Heist 1  and Heist 2 as the lead character. He also did Number Number and Keeping Score. “In Heist I was a writer and am writing the telenovela Isithembiso. The future looks bright as Lillian is pregnant and we’re engaged,” he said. His goal is to write and produce movies through his production company, Mdarkie.
