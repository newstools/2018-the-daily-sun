SAFETY is a priority in the City of Tshwane. That’s according to Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga. He was delivering the keynote address at a road safety operation launch held at the Centurion Licensing Centre recently. “Thank you for heeding the call to join forces with us to intensify operations as we seek to ensure high visibility in road policing, by-law enforcement, emergency services and crime prevention,” he said. He said the holidays cause traffic., as holiday makers make their way to holiday places. “Because of reckless behaviour, we’re forced to deal with deaths that could have been avoided,” he said. He had a few safety tips for road users:) Don’t speed) Don’t drink and drive) Be careful around pedestrians) Stay off the phone while driving) Buckle up and make sure children are buckled up, too. Msimanga said they would maintain a zero tolerance approach throughout the festive season. Focus would be on pedestrian safety, overloaded trailers, public transport vehicles, drunken driving and speed law enforcement. “We’ve deployed officers to all busy roads like the N1, N4, Moloto Road and Mabopane Highway to ensure police visibility,” said Msimanga. Tshwane Metro cops would also focus on cable theft and by-law enforcement by visiting entertainment places. They would also target formal businesses to check for compliance.
