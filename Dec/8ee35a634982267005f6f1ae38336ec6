LWANDLE told Daily Sun at first it was fun that he did not have an orgasm, but six years later this is beyond a joke! Lwandle Khumalo (33) from Tjovitso, Orange Farm, south of Joburg said he broke up with his girlfriend eight years ago and now he needs help. “At first nyatsis were happy when they realised I could not stop or ejaculate,” said Lwandle. “Now girls are running away from me. How do I stop without ejaculating?” Lwandle told Daily Sun he was once called a two-minute noodle because he ejaculated early, but that has changed and now he can’t stop. Lwandle consulted a doctor who told him he had no problem and that he needed to start eating healthy and try again. Lwandle said he stopped drinking alcohol and started eating healthy, but nothing changed. “I realised then that my 4-5 had been cursed,” said Lwandle. He started consulting sangomas, who confirmed he had been cursed. Lwandle said that the sangoma made him steam with muthi. “I had high hopes, but there was no progress,” said Lwandle, who added that he was also concerned about having kids. “I don’t want to die without having kids. I need to build the Khumalo family,” said Lwandle. Daily Sun spoke to sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi,who said Lwandle had been cursed but it could be fixed. “Lwandle can come visit me and I will help him. There are sangomas who are chancers, but things will work out,” said Joseph.
