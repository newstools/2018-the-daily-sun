WHILE most women wouldn’t mind getting younger, Duduzile Baartman feels differently. She said birthdate and surname errors on her ID book would affect her negatively in future and wanted them sorted out. Duduzile blames officials at the Commercial City Home Affairs offices in Durban. The angry 47-year-old from Chesterville in Durban said officials gave her an ID with the wrong birth date, month and year. From the time when she started applying for an ID book in 1998, her surname was misspelt twice. She said they were now refusing to correct the errors, saying she should pay R400 to have this done. Duduzile was born in 1971, but the ID book has her birth date as 1974 and her surname is incorrectly spelt as Bartman. In 2005, after she reapplied, the second ID had the wrong details. “I went back for the third time this year to correct the errors,” she said. “I told them it was their fault because I had given them the correct details, but they put in the wrong ones.” She was disappointed when officials told her she would have to pay to have the details changed. “I can’t pay for a mistake that was made by the officials,” she said. “My birth certificate had the correct details. I can’t afford the amount they want me to pay for their mistake.” Duduzile said she wanted it sorted out because it would affect her badly in future. “When the time for me to get a pension comes, I won’t get it because of this.” Home Affairs spokesman Cyril Mncwabe said: “I informed the applicant she had six months to approach our offices to rectify the errors, which she failed to do. “She has been advised to get confirmation of birth from the hospital and a confirmation letter from the school she first attended so we can see if it was our fault, or the information submitted earlier.”
