WE like to think of them as a best
friend we couldn’t live without, but sometimes our obsession with our cellphones
is deadly. The Straits Times is reporting that Salsabila
Ayu Putri (6) from a village in West Java was playing with a cellphone that was
charging. It was about 4pm on Thursday and a
violent storm arrived. Lightning struck the house and the child
died instantly. Earlier in December, martial arts champion
Irina Rybnikova (15) from Bratsk, Russia paid the ultimate price when she
charged her iPhone while she took a bath, the Sun is reporting. She was electrocuted when it fell in the
water. Last July, Madison Coe (14) from
Lovington, New Mexico was enjoying her usual leisurely bath, playing with her
cellphone. She needed to charge it, so she fetched
an extension cord. Tragically, she touched the frayed part
where the wires poked through and was instantly killed. Besides the life-threatening dangers
that comes with mixing electricity with water, drivers who use their phones are
also making them into deadly machines. A road safety organisation estimates
that being distracted by a cellphone accounts for about 25% of Mzansi’s
horrific number of accidents. There are also the distracted
pedestrians who die because they cross roads while looking at their phones.
Just in America last year, about 6 000 people were killed in this way,
according to USA Today. A real shock is how often taking selfies
leads to sudden death. According to CNBC, this year 259 people died while
taking selfies, making it a more common cause of death than shark attacks. Last weekend a birthday celebration in
Cape Town had exactly that horror ending when Jolandi le Roux (31) fell to her
death from Lookout Point while taking a selfie.
