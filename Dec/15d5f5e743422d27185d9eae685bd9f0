SPECIAL cameras have been installed on the N1 in Modimolle, Limpopo. They will monitor motorists’ behaviour during the busy festive season. Sanral has installed the cutting-edge technology on the dangerous stretch of the N1 to improve road users’ safety near the Kranskop toll gate. Four gantries with sophisticated cameras and message boards will monitor speed on the N1, where deadly accidents recently happened. More than 133 people have died in 65 deadly accidents over six months. Sanral northern region manager Progress Hlahla said after the crash in September where 27 people died, they immediately responded. Ways have been found to make the road safer and to add infrastructure to encourage good driving behaviour. “Speed is a big concern and we worked closely with the Limpopo government and local police to find ways to identify unsafe behaviour and catch offenders. “The N1 between Tshwane and the border with Zimbabwe is one of the busiest freeways in the country and traffic volumes rise at the start of the festive season.” He said the system used average speed over distance technology, calculating the average speed of a vehicle from the time it passes one camera until it reaches another. “The technology is being used with success in Western Cape, where there has been a decrease in crashes.”
