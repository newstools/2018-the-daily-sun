Black Leopards midfielder Phathutshedzo Nange’s stunning half volley strike has been voted Absa Premiership goal of the month of September. Nange’s brilliantly taken goal came against Limpopo province rivals Baroka in a 1-0 win. The 26 year old becomes the first ever Black Leopards player to walk away with the goal of the month award. Other contenders for the award were Orlando Pirates’ Vincent Pule’s excellent finish against Baroka FC, Jabulani Maluleke’s stunningly executed free kick when Polokwane City shocked Bidvest Wits and Ayanda Patosi, in his side Cape Town City’s draw at Orlando Pirates, just to name a few.
