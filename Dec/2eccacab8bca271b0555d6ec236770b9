MPUMALANGA safety and security spokesman Joseph Mabuza was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Sunday. Before the accident Mabuza posted on social media about the importance of road safety, especially during the festive season. According to News24, police are looking for the driver of the bakkie that collided with Mabuza. Mabuza was reportedly returning from work when the accident occurred on the N4 between Malelane and Komatipoort. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the driver of the bakkie fled the scene. Meanwhile, Free State Health MEC Montsheng Tsiu expressed shock at the increasing number of fatal road crashes in the province. She said emergency medical services personnel were needed on all major roads across the province. “Our personnel are well-positioned to respond to all types of emergencies. “We ask for people to take responsibility and prevent road fatalities. “Our teams respond rapidly and are able to save lives in some instances. But when trucks and taxis are involved in head-on collisions, there are few survivors,” said Tsiu. The Road Traffic Management Corporation has proposed a number of new regulations in an attempt to reduce road deaths. Some of the proposed regulations include retesting drivers every five years when they renew their licences. He said when Kaunda launched the festive season road safety campaign on 7 December, he announced that 20 000 law enforcement officers would keep an eye on the roads. “We are disappointed that the number of deaths in our province has reached this level despite the resources we put into the road safety plan. We will continue to enforce traffic law in an effort to reduce road deaths,” said Mntungwa. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande is expected to release road death statistics on 9 January.
