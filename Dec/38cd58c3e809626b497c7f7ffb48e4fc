LAST month Sunday Sun reported that Winnie Ntsaba’s awards third installment of the Royalty Soapie Awards were nothing but a mess when they finally materialised at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park, east of Joburg, because in addition to other mishaps, winners had to share one trophy. But, it seems the winners of that evening finally received their trophies. Some stars who such as Anga Makubalo and Lesego Marakalla posted their trophies on their Instagram accounts. Lesego is posing holding the trophy next to her on-screen family Shoki and Buhle Maseko. Today we celebrate @lesego_marakalla. Your hard work, dedication, passion has led to this Royalty Award.
