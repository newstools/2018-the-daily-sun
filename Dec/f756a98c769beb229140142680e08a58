THE threat of a violation by an officer of the law can clearly be seen in the Independent Police Investigative Directorate's (IPID) 2017/18 annual report which recorded 105 incidents of sexual assault by a police officer and nine incidents of sexual assault by an officer while in police custody. IPID derives its mandate from Section 206 (6) of the Constitution which is that of ensuring effective independent oversight of the South African Police Service (SAPS) and Municipal Police Services (MPS). According to the KwaZulu-Natal traffic department, there are several things to note when a woman has to be searched or arrested. "In the case that a woman has to be searched or arrested, then a woman officer needs to do the body search. "If there is no female officer present, that does not warrant the male officer a right to proceed with the search," acting station commander Nalini Singh emphasised at a roadblock in Harrismith, Free State, in early December.
