Superstar rapper Cassper Nyovest pulled off yet another successful #FillUp concert this past weekend at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, however, it appears to have come at a cost, R7m to be exact. Following the show, the star revealed that he was having mixed feelings because while he was able to pull it off, it had come at quite some cost. “Bitter sweet morning. Knowing that we lost millions due to the lack of sponsorship and broken promises breaks my heart but knowing that 100 000s of people are inspired makes my life,’ he wrote on social media. Speaking to SABC News, Cassper further elaborated on the toll the preparations for the concert took on him and his team and revealed the amount of money they lost. "The biggest challenge with where we are as a team is that is that we refuse to accept mediocre, so we’re trying to push the industry further. “Most often we find ourselves in positions where we need funding and we need sponsorships from institutes like the government, and we were not able to be supported the way we should be. "For instance, we just came from Mabhida and right now we’re sitting with R7m debt after engaging with all the different departments that were supposed to help us." Cassper, real name Refiloe Phoolo, said some of the sponsors pulled out on the day of the concert, mainly because of a rumour that they had been given R56m. Despite this, the rapper went on to perform at the Global Citizen Festival the following day.His fourth album Sweet and Short also went platinum on the first day of release.
