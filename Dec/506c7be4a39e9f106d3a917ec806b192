QUEEN B is going to start the New Year on a high note. While people are planning to make 2019 a good year, it looks as if it has already blessed Bonang Matheba. The TV personality will be on both the small and big screens. She’s set to continue with her reality show and star in a new film. Her reality show Being Bonang continues, and Bonang has posted she will star in a documentary film, Public Figure, produced by Brian Corso. It explores the psychological effects of social media use and will feature several influencers including Sebastian Tribbe and Gregory O’Gallagher, who will share how they deal with the fame, hate and money. On Fridays viewers will be glued to their TV screens as the third season of the adventures of Bonang’s private life with her family and friends will be aired. Her cousin Pinky Girl, who has created a place for herself in the hearts of Mzansi, will also feature. The last season of the show was broadcast on DStv’s 1Magic. With every episode trending on social media, Bonang made sure to give her followers exactly what they wanted last season.
