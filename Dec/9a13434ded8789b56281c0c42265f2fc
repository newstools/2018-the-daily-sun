A PLANE ticket mix up prevented Malwedhe hitmaker, King Monada from entertaining fans in Durban. Monada was added to the list of performers to headline Cassper Nyovest’s #FillUpMosesMabhidaStadium on Saturdray. Despite the last minute invite, Monada, whose real name is Khutso Kgale, was ready to go to KZN to entertain fans. But his manager, Albert Makwela, said they had a problem with plane tickets as their surnames had been mixed up. “The process to correct the mistake took time and by the time Cassper’s team finished the process, it was too late. The flight had already left,” said Albert. Meanwhile, some fans were expecting the Ska Bhora Moreki hitmaker to grace the stadium, but were left disappointed. Some people at the stadium told Daily Sun even though Monada was added at the last minute, they looked forward to his performance. Kabelo Marutla said: “Imagine the whole stadium idibaling to Monada’s song. It would have been crazy.” Albert said Monada looked forward to entertaining his fans in Durban. “The mix up saddened him but mistakes happen.”
