SALT. That’s the stuff must of us sprinkle over our eggs for breakfast. But Percy Maimela (33) from Winterveldt, north of Tshwane uses salt to perform magic! Percy has been showcasing his work at Pretoria State Theatre since last Thursday - even creating his art works as people watched. He said his art work is about a window of chance. “I quit my retail job to focus on my craft. I always knew I would leave. The decision came eventually,” he said. He said people in Mzansi should create jobs for themselves. “People can beat unemployment if they take the chance. They need to do what they are good at and make money from it,” he said. Percy said he was at work in 2014 when he found a damaged bag of salt. “I decided to create something radical and that’s when it started,” he said. At his exhibition he created a portrait of Miriam Makeba. “I thought of using Mama Makeba since it is 16 days of activism to show how strong women are,” he said. Many Tshwane people enjoyed watching him do the art and said they were impressed. Lerato Motaung (33) said she was proud to see local talent. “There are many talented people who are sitting on their talents. Percy is such an inspiration to young South Africans,” she said.
