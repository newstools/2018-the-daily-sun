EHLANZENI is being left behind in preparation for the 2019 elections. That is according to Mpumalanga IEC manager Jabu Mthethwa, who was speaking at a meeting with the provincial legislature on Wednesday. Mthethwa said the province was affected by major issues, such as the low number of people registered to vote next year. She said people’s addresses being held back due to them living in informal settlements also affected voter registration at each municipality. “Gert Sibande and Kangala districts are doing well in terms of preparations for the elections, with Ehlanzeni being left behind, especially the Bushbuckridge areas. “The issue of rural residents without addresses should be dealt with, as their votes are important,” she said IEC chairman Glen Mashinini encouraged observers to help ensure that political parties abide by election rules, and to communicate with potential voters to urge them to register and vote. Legislature speaker Violet Siwela said she appreciated the work of the IEC so far. She said their members were trying their best to put together resources to ensure the gaps identified were addressed. The IEC is recruiting and training about 55 000 registration staff for the registration weekend and about 200 000 people who will be working during the elections. It is also developing special training materials for party agents, the media and observers.
