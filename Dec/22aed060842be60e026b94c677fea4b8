EASTERN Cape Human Settlements MEC Babalo Madikizela on Sunday visited homes affected by the disaster in Ngwemnyama Village, Ntabankulu. Five families lost their houses when the wind blew away the roofs and the rain damaged the furniture and destroyed groceries on Friday. Ziphathe Zweni (52) said they slept like pigs after his two-roomed house was damaged by the winds. “All groceries were damaged because of the heavy rain. “We’re now stuck in a rondavel. I hope that we can get something to cover our heads, even if it’s a temporary shelter.” Thembakazi Zweni (33) said she and her mother-in-law were in the house when the wind started blowing. “My mother-in-law was able to escape to the hut before the roof was blown off. Our groceries for the month were destroyed,” she said. “Simple things have become huge tasks. Nine members of this family share one hut. When we bath, the men have to go outside. We’re asking the government to help as we have already used our social grant money,” she said. Madikizela said they wanted to see how best they could help. “We’ve seen the damage. Our officials will conduct further assessments. We’ll come back in 10 days’ time with something to give to these families.” The families received groceries, blankets and mattresses.
