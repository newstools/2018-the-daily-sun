 Cheryl Zondi has launched a foundation to support women and
children. The Non-Profit Organisation (NPO) has officially been
registered and will be called the The Cheryl Zondi Foundation. Chairperson of the CRL Commission Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva will
reportedly be Zondiâ€™s deputy. Zondi told the media that she named the foundation after
herself, because of the support she received after her ordeal. She came into the spotlight at the Omotoso trial as Omotoso,
Zukiswa Sitho (28) and Lusanda Solani (36) are facing charges of racketeering,
violating the sexual offences act, human trafficking and rape. The senior pastor at the Jesus Dominion International Church
has been in prison since his arrest in April last year. He was denied bail twice after it came to light that he was
a flight risk. Lusanda and Zukiswa, who are accused of recruiting, grooming
and monitoring the movements of girls for the pastor, are out on R2 000 bail
each.
