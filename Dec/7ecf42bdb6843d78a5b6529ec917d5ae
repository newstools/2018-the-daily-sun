Moonwood United chairman Sello Mangwana was happy with his players’ achievements. The U-16 and 18 teams of the soccer club from Brown’s Farm in Philippi, Cape Town, were recently promoted from the premiership league to the super league. “This promotion shows my boys gave it their all even though it was not easy,” said Sello. He said he sometimes took money out of his own pocket to ensure the players got everything they needed. “When I started this club, my aim was to help young boys because there are a lot of bad things that are happening around our area.” Some of the players are former drug addicts who changed their ways after joining the team. Coach Lebusa Mbucane said they needed sponsors to help them produce Mzansi’s next big players. “We need soccer kits and balls. “We need all the help we can get in order to continue our journey. “I believe if we can get more sponsors, more people will join the club.” Midfielder Odwa Soci (16) said: “We have been working hard to be where we are today and we are happy our hard work has paid off.” He urged people and businesses to invest in sport, especially in kasis.
