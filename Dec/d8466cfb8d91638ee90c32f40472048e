S  inger Vusumzi Kambi wants to inspire the youth from his kasi to chase their dreams. The Afro soul singer from Nyanga East in Cape Town, whose stage name is Vusi Chase, makes music which tackles social ills in his kasi. “I’m happy God gave me a voice to help inspire people and be able to speak to them so we can bring change in society. “Kids carry weapons from a young age in Nyanga, and I hope to stop that through my music.” The singer released his first single, Chasing My Dream, in 2014 after he dropped out of university to pursue a music career. “Varsity was taking too much of my time. I wanted to focus on music. “I’ll go back some day. I just need to get my career off the ground first.” He told SunBuzz he admired Afro pop singers Ringo Madlingozi and Ntando Bangani. “I’ve always been fond of my language, and when I heard Ringo and Ntando’s songs I loved them because they embraced their culture. “Another thing that motivated me was that they came from humble homes yet made it. “That for me was confirmation that even though I came from a struggling home, I was going to make it.” He released his single Love Addiction last month and is working on album, Joy In The Dark. “The album will be about love, positivity and inspiration. It will be released next year.”
