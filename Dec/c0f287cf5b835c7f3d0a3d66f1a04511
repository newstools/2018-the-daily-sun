EKURHULENI cops have clamped down on hobos crowding the CBD of their towns and cities. The homeless people were removed and their makeshift tents destroyed. The Metro cops’ tough action followed several weeks of warnings to homeless people to move out of the CBD. Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department said they noticed that hobos were increasingly gathering in the CBD of Brakpan and Springs. The department said the hobos stood at the front doors of businesses, on pavements and in some instances on the premises of business establishments. This resulted in the city being overwhelmed with complaints. EMPD said the absence of cleaning facilities for the homeless and the general littering taking place had the potential to cause health issues. A special operation was conducted on Saturday in Springs and in Brakpan on Sunday. EMPD spokesman Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said Metro cops and traffic wardens removed several homeless squatters. They also confiscated some of their belongings which had caused an unbearable stench as well as obstructing business entrances and pavements. “The EMPD will periodically pounce on squatters to ensure the CBDs of Ekurhuleni towns are kept clean and that normal movement of pedestrians is not unduly hampered,” he said.
