Despite the R7 million debt that Cassper Nyovest claims he has incurred from #FillUpMosesMabhida concert, he still wants to thank every single fan who came out to support him. The fourth edition of the Fill Up concerts went down on the 1st December and was held outside of Johannesburg for the very first time. Mufasa says that although the organization of the concert was extremely challenging, it was all worth it and was deemed a huge success because of his adoring fans, the Tsibipians. CASSPER’S WEEKEND TO REMEMBER “Cassper Nyovest took it back to ekasi with a magnificent, authentic South African production at #FillUpMosesMabhida but the real highlight was the electrifying atmosphere at the stadium where fans sang and danced to every song during Cassper’s set and exuded such positive energy. Cassper Nyovest can’t thank his fans enough for making his fourth annual Fill Up concert a success,” Cassper’s people said in a statement.  The Fill Up team has also attributed the success of the concert, in addition to the fans, to the sponsors who stuck around despite the rumours that caused some of their other sponsors to back out. The concert was overshadowed by unfortunate rumours in the lead up of the big day, including the “false claims of allocated funds to the concert to rumours about the concert being shut down,” Cassper’s team continued in a statement.
