KAIZER chiefs have appointed Ernst Middendorp as their new coach after parting ways with Giovanni Solinas. Chiefs confirmed Solinas’ departure earlier after a string of disappointing results which included two defeats to arch rivals Orlando Pirates. Middendorp is returning for his second stint at Naturena having spent two seasons with Amakhosi. The 60 year old guided the Glamour Boys to the SAA Super 8 trophy in the 2006/2007 season defeating Supersport United in the final. Middeendorp rejoins his former club on a two and a half year deal, Chiefs confirmed. “We were looking for a coach who is experienced and who has an understanding of the club’s footballing culture,” said Kaizer Motaung. Middendorp’s assistant will be announced soon after Patrick Mabedi was also relieved from his duties. Chiefs’ MultiChoice Diski Challenge coach Arthur Zwane  will assist the German  for the upcoming three games.
