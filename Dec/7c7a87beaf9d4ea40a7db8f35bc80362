Former Miss SA and Miss World 2014, Rolene Strauss has released her inspirational, spoken word album, Secrets to My Growth. The album dropped today and is now available for purchase from digital platforms and all good music stores. The album shares universal lessons on life and each track will be accompanied by a video which is produced by Inhoud Huis Musiek which fans can view from Rolene’s YouTube channel. “Secrets to My Growth is a compilation of life lessons and stories that I would like to share with people; these are the things I wish I had known when I was younger. The album enabled me to bare my soul in way I have never done before, and to share parts of myself that people have never seen,” said Rolene in a statement. "While the videos offer some imaginative interpretations for the messages I’m trying to convey, they are there to plant a seed, not tell a particular story, and are therefore minimalistic. I want people to interpret each message as it applies to them in that moment, at that particular stage of their lives,” she continued.
