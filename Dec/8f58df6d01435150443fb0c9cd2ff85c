THESE brothers have the will of steel! They make beautiful decorations out of steel. Uthen (30) and Paulos Ndebele (19) from Harrismith said steel was their daily bread. They said they could easily cut, bend and weld steel into different forms of art and craft. The brothers started making the beautiful items seven years ago in Duduza in Nigel, Ekurhuleni. Originally from Zimbabwe, they said they could make anything from bicycles, flowers, guitars, frames and other items. But they also experienced some challenges in the past. They couldn’t finish school. Uthen told Daily Sun: “We used to be casual workers for a scrapyard in Duduza. We taught ourselves to bend steel to make arts and craft.” The father of two said he believed poverty and the lack of job opportunities made them creative with steel. “Our colourful products turn heads. We sell them wherever we can find a good spot. “We’re selling our stuff on Biddulph and Hamilton streets in Harrismith,” said Uthen. He said hey didn’t have a place to live. They were always on the road and usually used their van for shelter by sleeping at garages in Harrismith. “It takes us a day or a few days to complete an item. But it depends on the model size and decoration,” said Uthen. He said they used paint and a mix of varnish and petrol to make the products look beautiful. Their prices range from R150 for a small bicycle to R200 for a guitar and average-sized flowers.
