THIS suspected tsotsi tried to rob the wrong person! A taxi driver claimed he was walking behind him in Bloemfontein CBD on Sunday. He allegedly tried to pull out a R10 note from the driver’s pocket, but his luck ran out. The taxi driver alerted other drivers at the taxi rank. They caught the tsotsi. He was beaten badly and apparently ran over with a taxi in full view of the public. He was left to bleed on the streets. A witness, who runs a fruit stall at the rank, said he was convinced the man wouldn’t live after he was ran over twice with a Toyota Quantum. “His body was covered in blood. Taxi drivers told him they wanted to make an example of him. “Before the drama, the man was walking up and down the street,” said the witness. “I noticed that he was looking for trouble. “He appeared to be drunk. I then I heard taxi drivers screaming ‘catch him’. About eight taximen beat him. “More drivers came and beat the man to a pulp.” He said the thug was sjamboked, kicked and moered with fists. “He lost some of his teeth. I am sure he’ll never commit crime again. The man was taken to hospital for treatment.” Colonel Thabo Covane said: “We’re investigating a case of grievous bodily harm after a 35-year-old was assaulted. He was taken to Pelonomi Hospital for treatment.”
