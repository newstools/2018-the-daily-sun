AMAZULU are agonising over the fitness of their lethal striker Emiliano Tade who was on the receiving end of a wild tackle from Golden Arrows’ Nkanyiso Mngwengwe last week. Usuthu won the match 2-0. Tade, who was recently named Absa Premiership Player of the Month, tried to be strong when he was getting medical attention. When he was taken off, he covered his face with his hands and was seen crying afterwards. His place was taken by Ovidy Karuru in the 23rd minute. His right kneecap had studs and bruises all over it. Despite Usuthu having their in-form striker out, bulldozing striker Bongi Ntuli took centre stage by scoring twice. “Sometimes it happens like that and in all respect to Emiliano he was able to ride the tackle a little bit and of course he had to come out,’’ coach Johnson said afterwards. “But if you were on the touchline and could see the emotions of Tade then you’ll realise what type of a player he is. If I told you that he was crying, I’m sure none of you will believe me, but he was shattered after he had to come off. “Having said that I don’t know how bad the injury is because as you can see everybody is in a happy mood since we won the game. “And automatically the injury (the pain) goes down a little bit.” The win meant that the story of AmaZulu’s upward curve continues – a complete turn around of the team that was doomed to be at the bottom by this time of the season after they were docked six pints by Fifa in September. AmaZulu’s next game will be a tough away assignment against Polokwane City on 5 January. The festive season has been blissful for Usuthu who were presented with a Christmas gift of 13 points out of a possible 18.
