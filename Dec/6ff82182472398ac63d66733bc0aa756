NOMNIKELO Dudumayo had to flee her home after she was attacked and almost raped by her relative! The 49-year-old mum of two now lives with relatives as she fears the young man. Nomnikelo, from Ngcwan-guba Village, said government should do more to ensure the safety of women, especially in rural areas. Speaking from a relative’s home in Zithulele Village, she said the incident happened on 18 November in the middle of the night. Her relative allegedly assaulted her. He had accused Nomnikelo of poisoning youths in the village. He even threatened to rape her. She was home with her two sons, aged six and 12, when the incident happened. “He forced himself into the house and dragged me to the centre of the room,” said Nomnikelo. She said it was dark in the room because there was no electricity. “He told me he has been yearning for me a long time and wanted to kill me. “I fought him off, but he managed to drag me out of the room. By then I could recognise his voice and asked why he was doing such a thing to me,” she said. Nomnikelo said she was stabbed in the left eye, hands and upper body, but managed to escape and call for help. She said she passed out from the pain. “When I opened my eyes, I could see him. He had changed his clothes and was among people helping to carry me to the clinic,” she said. “I am still in pain. I fear I will be killed if I go back to my home.” Eastern Cape Social Development MEC Dr Pumza Dyantyi condemned the incident. Police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said: “A 24-year-old man was arrested and appeared in the Mqanduli Magistrates Court last Tuesday. “He was denied bail.”
