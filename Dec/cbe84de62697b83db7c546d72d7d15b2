MALEFETSANE Rantoe’s doll keeps thugs at bay. After experiencing seven break-ins in three years, the 32-year-old got his hands on a doll called Joseph for protection. Unlike his neighbours, Malefetsane from Bergman, Free State, doesn’t put his trust in dogs as several of them were poisoned. Joseph is clothed in a skirt, shirt, tie and sunglasses. From a distance, you wouldn’t be blamed for thinking there was a person standing in Malefetsane’s’ yard. “Three years ago, we experienced a lot of break-ins in our community. My house was broken into seven times and clothes, furniture and groceries were stolen when I had a dog. “I had five dogs and they were all poisoned when my house was broken into. “So one day I came up with the idea of buying a doll and clothing it. “I named it Joseph after the biblical character who protected his son. I’m planning to buy a few more dolls to place around the yard.” Neighbour Mpho Booi said: “I think it’s a brilliant idea because thugs don’t dare come close to his house. “Malefetsane’s doll has been in his yard for a year and none of his possessions have gone missing. I also plan to buy one.”
