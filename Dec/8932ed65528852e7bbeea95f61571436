MEN in the police have been encouraged to become good role models. Speaking to members at the annual International Men’s Day event held at the Police Academy in Tshwane on Friday, deputy national commissioner for management Lieutenant-General Sindile Mfazi told cops to take a stand against wrongdoing. “This seminar aims to improve gender relations, promote gender equality and produce responsible males,” he said. “Reflect on your positive contribution and progress made not only in the workplace but also in communities and households.” Mfazi said the seminar was initiated by the police’s Men for Change Forum as a platform to engage members in issues affecting men in the community. Issues discussed included mental health, gender-based violence, substance abuse, sexual harassment and crimes against women and children. Mfazi said the levels of violent crime against women and children were very concerning. He said violence against women and children was very hard to measure as these crimes were rarely reported. Mfazi said there was a lot of evidence that violence against women and children was present in all communities in South Africa. He encouraged members to take a stand against wrongdoing and to lead by example. “As the police, we should take action to prevent, combat and investigate crime, and to uphold and enforce the law,” he said. “We have powerful role models among us, including Police Minister Bheki Cele and national commissioner General Khehla Sitole. Let us play our part.”
