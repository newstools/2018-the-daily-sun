FORMER president Jacob Zuma caused isiphithiphithi on Twitter over the weekend. He posted two videos in which he spoke about the court ruling that he should pay for his legal fees. In the video, Zuma said it was important to respect decisions made by the courts. But he argued that people should be able to look into how consistent judges were when applying the law. Making an example, he questioned how the state paid for the legal costs of “apartheid killers” but won’t pay for a freedom fighter’s legal fees. Zuma said he had instructed his lawyers to appeal the ruling by the North Gauteng High Court that the state was not liable to pay his legal fees for the corruption case against him. But this didn’t go down well with some social media users. DA leader Mmusi Maimane tweeted: “Baba, are you using apartheid legislation and killers to defend your criminal case?” Zuma didn’t reply to the tweet, but his followers did. The only thing you should be doing is answering the question.” Some people said Zuma should just pay for his legal battles.
