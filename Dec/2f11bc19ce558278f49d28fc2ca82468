With news circulating that Maritzburg United coach Faldu Davids has been sacked by the club, club's supremo Farouk Kadodia says no decision has been taken, for now. Going to the game yesterday, it was well known that Davids will be sacked by the club after the game against Baroka FC even if he got the three points. Unfortunately, they couldn't get the maximum points as they lost 1-0 at Harry Gwala Stadium to plunge to the bottom of the log standings. Davids, who was appointed on 27 June 2017, has been this season unable to replicate the club's showing last season when they finish the record fourth on the Absa Premiership table, reaching the club's first ever cup final in the form of Nedbank Cup which they lost to Free State Stars. In 17 games the club played this season in all competitions, Maritzburg have only won two, lost seven, drew eight matches. ''That is incorrect, incorrect that the club has parted ways with Fadlu Davids, yet,'' Kadodia tells SunSport when asked if Davids has been fired by the club. ''The media wants to be breaking stories, which is totally unacceptable. Whatever the future of coaches, the club will announce and the club has not announced the future of the coaches yet. ''So at this point in time there's no decision taken.''  But SunSport sources understand that the club has parted ways with Davids and the club, as the chairman Kadodia has said, are set to make a public pronouncement in the next couple of days. Davids, who was announced as the interim coach before he took the post on permanent basis at the beginning of the season,  has a few months left on his contract which is set to expire at the end of this campaign.
