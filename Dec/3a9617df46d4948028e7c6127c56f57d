PROVINCIAL authorities have expressed concern over rising road deaths in Mzansi. Over the weekend, 28 people were killed in various accidents in the Eastern Cape. Transport spokesman Unathi Binqose said six people, believed to be relatives, died in a head-on collision on the R61 road near Mount Nicholas in Libode on Monday. “The car collided with a full minibus taxi. “The six occupants of the car, an adult and five children, were declared dead on the scene and 14 taxi occupants were injured.” On Monday, a minibus taxi overturned on the R61 near Cradock, killing three people and critically injuring three more. “Some of the injured were airlifted to Livingstone Hospital in Port Elizabeth, while others were rushed to Cradock Hospital,” said Binqose. “It’s reported that the taxi was travelling from Cape Town to Mthatha when the accident happened.” Transport MEC Donald Grant said there had been 86 road deaths since early this month. The past long weekend alone claimed nearly 40 lives! In a major accident, a taxi crashed on the N1 outside Touwsriver last week and claimed 12 lives including three children, while 10 others were rushed to hospital. Another taxi driver was arrested on the N1 near Touws River on Monday when he was caught trying to illegally overtake vehicles and driving towards oncoming traffic while flashing headlights. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said the taxi driver forced other road users onto the yellow line or completely off the road. “The driver was arrested by provincial traffic officials and will appear in court soon.” Western Cape government’s Operation Exodus has free road fitness tests for long-distance taxi drivers.
