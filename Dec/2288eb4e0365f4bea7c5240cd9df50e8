DEATH is haunting the Fairview fire station in Joburg. This is where two of the three firefighters who died in September’s Bank of Lisbon fire were stationed. The first incident was in 2015 when two firefighters became trapped in a basement of the burning Nedbank Mall in Albertina Sisulu Street and died of smoke inhalation. Hardly three years later, two more were taken from the same station. Firefighters suspect that the latest deaths were a result of the spirits of their dead colleagues. They want the spirits to stop causing death. Sangomas of the Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Rights Commission as well as pastors cleansed and prayed for the fire station yesterday. The ceremony was attended by the victims’ families, management, firefighters, pastors and traditional healers. The sangomas came armed with incense, muthi, snuff and tree branches. They burned incense and spoke to the dead. They called on all those who were stationed at the station to climb the branch of a tree so they could be taken to a river and released. The sangomas used a ritual at each unit used by the fallen heroes. “With this ritual, we are sure the spirits that were roaming around the station have been taken away and there will not be any more bad luck,” said sangoma Nixon Malada. But the sangomas’ rituals opened old wounds for the families of the victims. Many of them wept uncontrollably as they remembered their dead loved ones. Station management thanked the religious leaders and traditional healers for their rituals. They said they believed that things would be different from now.
