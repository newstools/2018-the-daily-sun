FISTS rained down on a man who crashed into a car that was parked at a petrol station. This occurred immediately after the crash. In the video, a white Hyundai i10 car is seen parked at a station. Then a blue Mazda 323 comes from behind and bumps into it. As soon as it stops, the angry driver of the white car pulls the driver Mazda out of the car and starts punching him non stop. He unleashed heavy fists and pushed away everyone who tried to stop him. VIDEO BY: INTELLIGENCE BUREAU SA.
