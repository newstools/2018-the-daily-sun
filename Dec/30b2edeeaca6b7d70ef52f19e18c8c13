The Global Citizen Mandela 100 Festival brought Mzansi to a standstill yesterday at the FNB Stadium. Fans were treated to an epic night of fun as they got a lifetime opportunity to see some of the world’s biggest stars perform live in front of a packed stadium. Sadly, that is where the fun ended for many fans who were unfortunate victims of a string of criminal activity outside the stadium after the concert. Panicked fans took to social media to share how they survived what many of them described as “a traumatic experience.” Criminals who had targeted the festival, had a feast as they attacked and robbed many helpless concert goers off their possessions at a petrol station. Celebrities like Danny K and LaSizwe have voiced their disappointment at the incidents that left many fans scared for their lives.
