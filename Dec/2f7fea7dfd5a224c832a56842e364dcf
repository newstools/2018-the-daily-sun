A 46-year-old
man was arrested for his alleged involvement in an armed robbery of the Kareedouw Police station
in the Eastern Cape. Mpumelelo
Magwala was arrested on Tuesday in Port Elizabeth by the Hawks’ Serious
Organised Crime Investigation unit. This after his
brief court appearance in court, on
the 6th of December 2018 for unlawful possession of a firearm. “The seized
firearm has since been linked as one of those that were stolen at the Kareedouw
Police station,” police spokesperson Captain Anelisa Feni said. Constable
Yandiswa Siyasanga Feni (30), was the first suspect to be arrested by the
investigating team. She was
arrested on the 12th of November 2018 for her alleged participation in the
robbery. In August,
four armed men entered and robbed the police station of firearms and
ammunition. “They
handcuffed Feni, before they opened the safe and made off with R5 rifles,
handguns, a police radio and various rounds of ammunition before the suspects
fled the scene,” Feni said. Both
Magwala and Feni remain in custody and are expected to appear at the same court
today.
