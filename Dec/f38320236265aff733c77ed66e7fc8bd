ACTING provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi has applauded Westville cops for busting two of their own. The two will appear in the Pinetown Magistrates Court on bribery and corruption charges after their arrest on Wednesday. Mkhwanazi praised the truck owner for not giving in to the urge to avoid responsibility by paying a bribe. “We need more honest citizens like him who work with authorities to get rid of corrupt government employees. “Police hate corruption and will not hesitate to arrest our own accused of it.” He said those who do not act against corruption when it is brought to their attention will face the full might of the law. “I also commend the cops who responded to the report of corruption and acted decisively in this case,” he said. Brigadier Jay Naicker said on Wednesday the two cops were apparently working in Westville when they pulled over a truck transporting passengers. “The truck allegedly was searched and they found the licence disc had expired and the passengers were foreigners. They allegedly demanded cash from the driver.” He said the driver apparently called his boss to deposit the cash and then drove with the cops to get the money. “The employer immediately called cops at Westville cop shop about the corrupt activities. “They instantly responded and caught the suspects at the mall as they tried to withdraw the cash. Their firearms were removed and they were held in cells.”
