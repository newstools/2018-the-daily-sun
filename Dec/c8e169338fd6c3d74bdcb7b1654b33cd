Sindisiwe Magoso’s music career took off last year as she announced herself with a number of hit songs. Magoso (19), popularly known by her stage name La Sauce, shot to fame after being discovered on social media. Her distinct vocals on popular DJ Miss Pru’s Phumelela, ensured that the star caught people’s attention and she has never looked back. She went on to release hits such as Cooler Bag, and I do. She has also bagged some accolades along the way. She had the kind of introduction to the music industry that would be difficult to top, however, she has expressed great satisfaction with how this year went. While she could not quite match her previous exploits, she has seen her brand grow bigger this year. "2018 has been a year of blessings and growth for me,” she wrote on Instagram. “I got to work with one of the greatest artist in the world including Davido, Emtee, Amada Black and KLY. “Bless Up to all my supporters, 2019 will find me just in time,” she added. 2018 has been a year of blessings and growth for me.????
