THE situation is tense between Nkonkotho Village livestock owners in eDumbe, northern KZN, and a local farmer. The farmer allegedly poisoned 47 goats which were grazing on his farm over the weekend. Mfana Zwane (41), who lost 27 goats, said residents were angry with the farmer and were demanding serious action against him. He said residents would not take money as compensation but wanted live goats. He said two weeks ago, the farmer had called them to a meeting and complained about the goats grazing on his farm. Zwane said the farmer had warned them he would poison the goats if they continued to graze on his farm. “We want our goats back. Farmers in eDumbe do as they please. “I’ve told other residents that opening a case won’t help, so we must demand our goats back.” Mayor Majuba Mavuso told Daily Sun the farmer had agreed to pay for the goats. He said he arranged to meet him late yesterday afternoon to discuss the payment. The farmer, Jacques Odendaal, said he was prepared to compensate all the goat owners. However, Jacques denied purposely poisoning the goats and blamed the owners for failing to control their livestock. He said he used poison to kill the rats which destroyed his maize and that the goats were killed by mistake. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said residents reported the matter to the police and a docket was opened. She said once they had finished their investigation, the farmer may be charged with cruelty to animals.
