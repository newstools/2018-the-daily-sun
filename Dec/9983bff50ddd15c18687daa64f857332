South African award-winning disability activist and humanitarian, Eddie Ndopu is set make history when he becomes the first physically disabled person in space. The 27-year-old will travel to space in 2019 in a groundbreaking campaign that will see him deliver a special message to the United Nations General Assembly. Eddie will make the speech on behalf of young people from across the world who feel excluded by society while also raising awareness about the rights of disabled youths. What’s more, Eddie has joined forces with youth urban pop-culture authority, MTV to bring this important voyage to the masses. News of the mission comes amid celebrations of the annual International Day of Persons with Disabilities which was observed on the 3rd of December. “As we pay tribute to Nelson Mandela’s 100th birthday, I can't help but think of his profoundly powerful words: ‘It always seems impossible until it is done.’ With the help of MTV, my campaign to become the first physically disabled person to travel into space is about showing the world that with a lot of heart and a bit of human ingenuity, anything is possible,” said Eddie. MTV will begin production on the project, yet to be named, in 2019.  “MTV will document everything from Ndopu enlisting an aerospace company to facilitate the flight, to his innermost thoughts as he gets closer to lift off, and finally, his celestial journey and message to world leaders,” said Viacom International Media Networks, who own MTV. Eddie was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy at birth and was given the devastating prognosis of a five-year life span. However, he has since beaten the odds and has been advocating for the rights of disabled young people for over a decade now, a pioneer in his field. The inspirational young man holds a Master’s Degree in Public Policy from Oxford University and has now set his sights on the stars.
