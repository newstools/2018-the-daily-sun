A 24-YEAR-OLD woman is in pain, even though neighbours are people one ought to trust. She was raped by a neighbour on Tuesday night! The woman from Mamelodi East extension 4, Tshwane, said the man was like an uncle to her. “We’ve known him for years, and I never felt unsafe around him.” She visited his house on Tuesday and he offered her a drink. “The drinks ran out and he went out to buy more,” she said. “Before we left I told him his windows were open.” She said she went to the kitchen after the man asked her to help him close the windows. “While I was waiting for him, he grabbed me and raped me. I screamed, hoping people would come,” she told the People’s Paper. “But nobody did.  I ran home and told my sister what had happened.” She said they reported the matter to the police. She said news of the incident had left the community in shock. “This man has a wife. I don’t know why he raped me,” she said. An angry resident (34) said they were disappointed that the man was released on bail. “We will write a petition to complain. He should remain in custody,” said the resident. “He has broken the trust his neighbours and the community had in him.” Mamelodi East police spokesman Captain Michael Mbewe said a case of rape was opened. Mbewe said the man appeared in the Mamelodi Magistrates Court on Friday and was released on bail.
