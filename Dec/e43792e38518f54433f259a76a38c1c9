IT WAS a happy day for residents at the official launch of the Dukuza rural housing project. The residents from ward 4 and 5 in Okhahlamba Local Municipality in the KZN Midlands celebrated the start of the rural housing project to build 500 RDPs worth R68 million. The building work is still ongoing but a few houses have been finished and owners given their keys. Wheelchair-bound Thulasizwe Dlomo (37) told Daily Sun that his joy can’t be explained in words. “In 2004 I became paralysed after being shot as a taxi driver. My life became a living hell,” he said. “Our family house was unsuitable to my needs and it was far from roads and clinics. Today I’m happy that I finally have a place of my own. It caters for all my needs as a paralysed person. It feels like a dream. I never thought this day would come.” Okhahlamba municipality mayor, Mlungisi Ndlangisa said: “Residents always applaud development but houses are always a priority. It restores their human dignity.” Human Settlement MEC Ravi Pillay said with such projects the department was aiming to balance the need for urban and rural housing.
