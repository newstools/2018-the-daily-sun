DEFENDER Junaid Sait has finally ended his search for a new club and has joined National First Division side Richards Bay FC. Sait has been training with the Natal Rich Boys under the watchful eye of former Cape Town All Stars coach Brandon Truter for over a week now. The former player for Falkenbergs in Sweden, where he was highly rated by former Barcelona and Manchester United striker Hendrik Larsen, was released by Ajax Cape Town at the end of last season when the club was forced to do some reshuffling after getting relegated to the National First Division. The 25-year-old, the son of former Orlando Pirates midfielder Kamaal Sait, first caught the eye in the NFD when he skippered Stellenbosch FC to the PSL play-offs in the 2016-17 season, where they failed in their quest for promotion as Baroka FC retained their PSL status. “Junaid Sait has signed for Richards Bay,’’ club chairman Sifiso Biyela revealed. Truter, who took over at the club at the beginning of this season, also confirmed the player’s signing, saying he was very excited to be reunited with Sait. “I coached him as a youngster before he went to Stars of Academy with Farook Khan,’’ the coach revealed. Sait is likely to feature when the Natal Rich Boys visit fifth-placed Maccabi FC on Saturday. Richards Bay are currently 10th in the NFD standings with 15 points from 12 games.
