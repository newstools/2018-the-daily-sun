HE was known as the guy who could help you with cables and transformers and he used to help connect squatters to electricity. But his illegal business as well as his life ended on Friday morning. He went to Amanda Park, Mamelodi in Tshwane to see if a transformer he had sold was working properly. But while he was checking, he fell onto the transformer box and was shocked dead. His lifeless body then lay unclaimed under a blanket. Residents claimed the people who hired him fled after he was killed. They said the city of Tshwane worker had stolen cables and transformers. A resident said the man and his friends delivered the transformer on Thursday. She said residents had given him money to buy it and to pay him for his work. “We have paid money and now we are without electricity. It will take time before we find another inyoka.” She said hiring izinyoka was their only choice. “We have been here for three years but do not have electricity or running water. “Service delivery is poor and we are forced to go the illegal route,” she said. Police Captain Michael Mbewe said an inquest docket had been opened. City of Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said an investigation would tell if the man was a municipal employee. He said the human resources department would find out whether he worked for the city or not.
