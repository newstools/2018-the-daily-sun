MORE and more women are being bust for drinking and driving. This is according to JMPD spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar. He said although the number of male drivers arrested for the same offence is still high, women seem to be catching up. There are underlying reasons why women are engaging in different behaviour, and one of the main contributing factors is men. Psychologist Kgomotso Masokoane told Daily Sun that the daily stresses being faced by women have increased. “Women are no longer just housewives. Their responsibilities are more than they were previously,” she said. On men, Kgomotso said husbands expected their wives to come home from work to cook and do other chores while they sat and drank beer. For that to be resolved, men should meet women halfway and that may help reduce stress levels. “When the wife is cooking, the man should help children with homework,” she said. Kgomotso also stressed that women were getting into higher positions at work, which could be demanding and stressful. “They end up drinking alcohol as a coping mechanism,” she said. She said it started with one or two glasses and gradually became a habit. Kgomotso warned that as much as alcohol could make one happy, it would worsen pre-existing conditions such as depression. With a rise in the number of women behind the wheel, they often drive on their own to functions or girls’ nights out. “People must limit their alcohol intake, especially if they are going to be driving,” said Kgomotso. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane said: “Young women should stop indulging in alcohol when they know they are going to be driving. “There is nothing wrong with women who are independently enjoying themselves, but make sure you have a sober driver when you decide to drink.” She pleaded with all motorists not to drink and drive and drive and text.
