AS YOU rush around to get all your festive shopping done, remember to spare a thought for those who do not have that privilege. And if you are driving down to the Eskia Mphahlele robots in Tshwane, why not donate just as little as five bucks towards one prospective student? Graduates will again be wearing academic regalia and pleading with motorists to donate funds to help disadvantaged young people get tertiary education next year. Last year they managed to raise funds for about 108 students to further their studies. This year they hope to get enough money to help more than 200 prospective students for the 2019 academic year. The graduates from the Youth Empowerment Organisation started the initiative called Thusangwanageno, which means “help your brethren”. The initiative seeks to help prospective students accepted by institutions of higher learning with registration and tuition fees. Founder John Molepo said the students would also be helped with the stationery needed to start their academic year. The initiative, which kicked off on Friday, will run until the end of January. John said Friday was a great day as they had raised more than R30 000. He said those who gave were mostly taxi drivers. Even last year, taxi men were generous. John said this year they decided to take their initiative to other parts of the country such as Potchefstroom, North West and Polokwane, Limpopo. “Although we are still experiencing some problems with one of the cities, we know that at the end this good cause will prevail,” he said. John called for other graduates to join them and help the poor students. “It is important that we assist prospective students in order for them to achieve their dreams,” he said.
