PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday declared that a special official funeral, category 1, would be held for the late Mendi Msimang. Msimang was a struggle stalwart and former high commissioner to the United Kingdom. The 90-year-old recipient of the Order for Meritorious Service (silver) died on Monday after a long illness. A statement issued by the Presidency said the national flag would be flown at half-mast until the day of Msimangâ€™s funeral on Saturday. A special official funeral, category 1, entails elements of military ceremonial honours for persons of extraordinary credentials specifically designated by the president. The funeral service for Msimang, who was a senior member of the ANC, will take place in Pretoria at a venue to be announced later this week, the statement said. Yesterday South African diplomats held a memorial service in honour of Msimang. International Relations and Cooperation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu welcomed the family and friends of the late ambassador. Speaker after speaker described Msimang as someone who always wanted the best for the ANC and everyone in the country.
