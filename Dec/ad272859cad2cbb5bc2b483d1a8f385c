Babes’ behaviour in the video was met with mixed reactions from fans with some saying she had every right to react while others said it was not the sort of behaviour one would expect from a public figure. Nevertheless, the Domoroza hit-maker insists that she too is human and should be allowed to react however she feels. “We are all humans, being a celeb doesn’t mean I’m an animal. I have feelings, emotions, a heart etc. Let me be,” she captioned a video of the late Brenda Fassie echoing the same sentiments.
