OVER 1 100 suspects spent the weekend behind bars, thanks to the police’s Safer Festive Season Operations. Captain Mavela Masondo of Gauteng police said police recovered 21 illegal firearms and out of those bust, over 130 motorists were caught for drunk driving. Masondo warned: “Gauteng residents should expect more road blocks, as well as raiding of liquor outlets. “Police will be at shopping malls, highways and taxi ranks to prevent road deaths due to drunkenness and stop robberies.” In Ekurhuleni, 143 suspects were bust for dealing in drugs, rape, truck hijacking, possession of suspected stolen vehicles, drunk driving and assault, while Tshwane police bust more than 113 suspects for similar offences. Operations in Soweto and the West Rand resulted in the arrest of over 148 suspects. All the suspects will appear in different magistrates courts in Gauteng soon. Masondo urged residents to be careful and enjoy their festivities responsibly.
