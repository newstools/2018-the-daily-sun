BEYONCE finally posted a video about her trip to Mzansi. The video, which was posted on Tuesday, was of highlights of her performance at the Global Citizen Festival. The background song on the video was DJ Maphorisa’s iWalk ye Phara. Soon after the video was posted, people came out and said the song of the year was decided by the original Queen B. Gugulethu Mhlungu, an editor, radio presenter and writer, tweeted: “Very kind of Beyonce to provide clarity on the song of the year matter. It was looking bleak.” Showrunner Portia Gumede felt the same: “When Beyonce heard how your radio stations once made that Van Damme song the song of the year, she decided to do it for us . . . Nayi Le Walk.” But other social media users were not having it. They said Mzansi had already decided that King Monada’s Malwedhe was the song of the year. The People’s Paper ran a poll on Facebook and on its website, so SunLanders could have their say. The results showed that King Monada’s Malwedhe was more popular with SunLanders on Facebook, and some suggesting iWalk ye Phara didn’t have the impact Monada’s song had. Thabiso Segoana wrote: “Admin, even a newborn baby can surely answer that: King Monada’s Ra Idibala.” The website poll showed 58% said Malwedhe was the song of the year. Only 16% chose iWalk ye Phara, while 27% said neither Malwedhe nor iWalk ye Phara deserve to be song of the year.
