METRO cops are not taking any excuses and drunk drivers are their number one target! Armed with the new Ebat breathalyser, drivers should know the cops are serious. According to Joburg Metro cops spokeswoman Sergeant Tessa Adams, four drivers were arrested and prosecuted over the past weekend. She said the breath-scanning device was very effective. She said, in total, 33 drivers were arrested for drinking and driving – including the four who were prosecuted immediately. Adams said: “We’ve arrested four drivers using the new machine. Twenty-nine were arrested and had to draw blood. She said it would be available to all officers at roadblocks on New Year’s Eve. Ebat, which stands for Evidential Breath Alcotest Machine, is the new way of testing blood alcohol. The readings are said to be more accurate and instantaneous – unlike the months or years it takes for a blood test to get processed by forensics. However, some people have complained about the way the machine is used. Some motorists claimed that Metro cops use the same mouthpiece on different drivers. But Adams cleared the confusion. She said the breath test follows two steps: “The first step is to blow into the machine, which will not be too close to the lips.” She said this was needed for the machine to detect any alcohol on the tested person’s breath. If alcohol is detected, the second step follows. “The second step requires a special object. The officer handles the object with gloves and each piece is sealed in plastic. “The officer unseals the piece and attaches it to the machine. The driver blows into the mouthpiece which then determines blood alcohol level. “The officers are not allowed to tamper with the Ebat machine,” she said.
