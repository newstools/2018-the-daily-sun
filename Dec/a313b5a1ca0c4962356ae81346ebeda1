THE SPCA has laid animal cruelty charges over the slaughter of a sheep on Clifton Beach last week. Cape Town councillor Jean Pierre Smith also told Daily Sun the city is filing a complaint against the security company that chased people off the beach. After a video was posted in which a man claimed black people were being kicked off the beach, the #OccupyCliftonBeach movement started on Twitter. Hundreds protesting over the alleged act of chasing black people off Clifton Beach last Friday descended on the beach. They waved placards with messages like “Reclaiming our beaches” and “Sizoyingena nge vosho iClifton Beach” (We will be arriving at Clifton Beach in voshos). Soon, a sheep was slaughtered. But animal rights activists and Clifton residents soon arrived. Social media exploded,with many supporting the slaughter while others called it barbaric. Security firm PPA Security claimed they were operating on the authority of the city but Cape Town Executive Director for Safety and Security Richard Bosman denied the city contracted the company. “All city beaches are open to all people. While the city can set usage times at beaches, we do not impose this unless there is a specific threat to people’s safety.” Mayor Dan Plato denied black people were singled out. “A security organisation asked people of all races to leave. Beaches are open to all and we strive to make them a safe space for all.”
