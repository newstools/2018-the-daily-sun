LIFE was good when Nyiko was an Uber driver for three years But now Nyiko Ngobeni’s life has come to a standstill. The life of the 37-year-old from Meadowlands, Soweto, is falling apart. He wanted to take a code 14 licence so he could drive trucks, so he tested at the Randburg traffic department on 3 August and passed. “I got my temporary licence and was told to wait six weeks to collect my permanent licence,” he said. “After a month I went back to collect my licence, but they told me there was a strike.” Every time he went there, he spent R100 on transport. But the worst was yet to come. While Nyiko was waiting for his licence, his professional driving permit expired. When he tried to renew it, he was told he must wait for his licence as he couldn’t renew his permit using a temporary licence. Three weeks ago, Nyiko lost his Uber job because of his expired licence. “I can’t drive passengers any more because of my licence problem. “My boss told me to fix my problem and I was replaced immediately.” Nyiko, a breadwinner, can’t support his wife, two kids and mum. “I can’t even sleep at night. I don’t know how I’ll survive the Christmas season.” Randburg licensing department manager Tata Mabiya said they were aware of the matter “Nyiko should come back to the station with his temporary licence to reorder his licence,” he told Daily Sun.
