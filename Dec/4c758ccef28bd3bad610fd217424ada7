So for months and months now, Maps Maponyane has been giving us sneak peaks into the renovations that have been going into an apartment space he purchased. We have seen the walls coming down, the floor plans for the new apartment, the cement being poured and everything else in between. Maps even let us in his furniture shopping missions, even asking fans to vote on which piece he should go for. Map’s architectural and interior design masterpiece is finally complete and he has given us a peak at the finished product, rightfully so, since we were part of the whole process. “Adulting isn't easy, but it can be worth it. Home. Finally,” he said. And it truly is beautiful; the space is masculine, modern and sophisticated, seamlessly blending African and western inspired aesthetics. Adulting isn't easy, but it can be worth it. Home. Finally????
