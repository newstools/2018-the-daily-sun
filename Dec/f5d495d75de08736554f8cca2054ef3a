Actress Linda Mtoba detailed “the most traumatic night” of her and her husband’s lives on social media after a series of events that could have easily ended in tragedy. The former Isibaya star’s husband was hijacked at gunpoint over the weekend and put into the boot of the car while the thugs made cash withdrawals. “They had him for over 2 hours. Dumped him eNtuzuma. Took his shoes jacket wedding band watch, everything,”she revealed on social media. “I thank God they didn’t hurt him. Words can’t begin to describe the trauma of this. I felt my insight turn cold.” Things only got worse for the actress as she and her mom had a car ram them from behind as they were stationary at the robot on their way to check on her husband. “We felt a force move us. But I didn’t move the car. Only when it stopped did we realize what happened. It’s after 1am in the morning. When I say God protected us I mean it. “My husband myself and my mom are okay. It’s all God’s grace honesty. There’s no other words. I’ve been crying the whole morning police stations & hospitals. But we’re okay." ALSO READ: PICS: INSIDE LINDA MTOBA’S BDAY CELEBRATION!
