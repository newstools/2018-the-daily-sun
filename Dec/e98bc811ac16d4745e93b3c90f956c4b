THE peaceful smoke of ganja filled the room where the five friends chilled together. But the peace was shattered by the loud bangs of gunfire as a group of men pounced on them. Afterwards, as silence fell, neighbours rushed to the scene and found bodies piled up in a pool of blood. The horror killings happened in Phumula Gardens near Rondebult, Ekurhuleni. Neighbours said the sound of gunfire lasted for close to 10 minutes before midnight on Wednesday. They said the sound of the gunshots were so deafening that they jumped from their beds to hide under them. After the incident, all went quiet. Thembisile Mazibuko, who lives in the house where the shooting happened, said she got up from where she was sleeping to peep through the window. She was greeted by blood streaming from her brother’s back room. She alerted the neighbours. They found her brother, Sipho Mazibuko (37), already dead. Not far from where he was lying were three of his friends, Kamogelo Khabo (32), Lebo Naviss (29) and Monde Busako (29), who was still breathing. Monde’s mother, Constance Busako, said her son was taken to Thelle Mogoerane in Vosloorus Hospital but died later. A fifth victim identified only as Nikiwe (29) tried to run away, but was followed by gunmen and shot several times at the gate of the house. He died on the spot. Cops and two ambulances arrived to scene. Four victims were certified dead on the spot. Police spokesman Manare Ramotshela confirmed five people were shot dead and said no arrest had been made. “We appeal to the public to help us trace these suspects.” Anyone who has information is asked to contact 08600 10111.
