TWO men appeared in the Welkom Magistrates Court on Friday after they were bust with dagga on Wednesday. Captain Stephen Thakeng said the two were arrested in Riebeeckstad in Welkom, Free State. Thakeng told Daily Sun members of the Welkom K9 unit were patrolling when they received a tip-off about a white car selling dagga. “They immediately informed the crime intelligence unit. “They carried on patrolling and spotted a car matching the description. “They followed it, and when they approached the house the gate was locked. A young girl opened the gate. Police found two suspects packing dagga in small packages. “They could not explain why they had such a large quantity of dagga in their possession.” He said the two suspects, aged 27 and 29, were arrested and charged with dealing in dagga. “The 163kg of dagga was estimated to have a street value of about R244 000,” he said. “They will be back in the same court on Friday for their bail application.” Acting Welkom cluster commander Brigadier Mzondi Mojafi praised K9 and crime intelligence unit members.
