THE MAABANE family said their dead mother feels neglected . . . And that has brought their life to a standstill! Mildred Ndlovu was among the 18 people who died in the Kruger Park veld fires in 2001, and the family has been struggling to visit her grave for the past 17 years. Thabo Maabane (34) from Hluvukani, Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, claimed the family is fed up with being denied free access to their loved one’s grave. They accused the Kruger National Park management of making it difficult for them to visit Mildred’s grave, which is located in the park. Mildred Ndlovu was among 18 people who died in the Kruger veld fires in 2001. Thabo claimed it has been difficult for his family to go there at any time because the park’s management had told them they could visit only on specific dates. “We have been struggling for many years to practise our culture without any disturbance. “There is a lot that has been holding us back for all these years, because our mother feels like we have neglected her. Our lives are at a standstill and we cannot get employment,” said Thabo. He claimed they have been asking the park’s management to relocate the graves, but it seems their request has fallen on deaf ears. “They must allow us to move the graves to where we will be able to visit at any time.” Sanparks spokesperson Isaac Phaahla said the park had never refused access to families. “We advised them to make prior arrangement with SanParks as and when they intend to visit, so we can arrange for a safety officer to accompany them,” said Phaahla.
