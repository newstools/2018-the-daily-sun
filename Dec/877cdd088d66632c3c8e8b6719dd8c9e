Local photographer, creative director and budding fashion icon, Trevor Stuurman has once again achieved a major milestone. The 25-year-old Kimberley-born creative has partnered with global sportswear giant, Nike and Olympian, Caster Semenya to create a campaign aimed at helping the youth. Though the medium of fashion, the three forces have formed the Born To Do It Camp in Soweto. The campaign commits them to empowering the youth of South Africa through talks, workshops and various training programmes. Trevor can be seen in the announcement photography wearing a white custom-made suit by Soweto-born, Rich Mnisi. The fashion creative has also had the privilege of creating his very own custom Nike sneakers, the Stuurman Air-Forces which he wears for the campaign. Trevor works with Nike alongside iconic athlete, Caster Semenya who was announced as one of the faces of Nike’s Just Do It campaign. The news comes amid an extremely busy time for Trevor, who has made major strides in his career over the past few months, working with big names such Beyonce and Jay-Z, Asap Rocky, Naomi Campbell, Gucci, Absolut, Global Citizen, and Vogue. Honoured to have joined forces with @nike and @castersemenya800m for the Born To Do It Camp in Soweto. Together with Nike we have committed to empowering the youth of South Africa through training, workshops and various talks. | Wearing one of Soweto’s own @rich_mnisi + Custom Stuurman Air-forces. #BornToDoIt #JustDoIt A post shared by  Trevor (@trevor_stuurman) on Dec 8, 2018 at 12:19am PST  It was all a Dream...
