MANDLA Nkosi is an angry man. The 43-year-old from Sebokeng zone 11, Vaal, doesn’t take kindly to people telling him where and when he should smoke zol. “This makes me angry. I’m not smoking in anyone else’s yard,” he said. “I smoke zol in my yard. Hands off my zol!” He told Daily Sun his neighbours didn’t want him to smoke in his yard. “They want me to go to the field when I want to smoke,” he said. Mandla claimed his neighbours had ganged up on him and complained that the dagga smoke got inside their houses. “Some have even said it makes their clothes smelly,” he said. “Why don’t they just close their windows. “I plant this zol myself. I won’t stop smoking because of jealous people.” He said zol helped his body fight disease. “I don’t get sick. I don’t know when last I went to the clinic,” he said. “It’s my life. Zol is my food. “If anyone thinks they can just come and stop me from smoking, we’ll have a very huge problem.” Mandla said all he wanted was for his neighbours to stop harassing him. “I’m tired of them. I want them to stop sticking their noses in my business,” he said. A neighbour told the People’s Paper what Mandla was doing was not right. “Zol smells very bad. This guy smokes almost every day,” he said. “We’re tired of living under a cloud of zol.”
