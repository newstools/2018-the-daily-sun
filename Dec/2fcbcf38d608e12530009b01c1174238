SOMETIMES strong headlines push government officials into action, but at other times all it takes is a kind word. This time, SunPower came to the rescue of matric pupil Kele-bogile Dire (18). Kelebogile was seriously worried when the school exams started in October, because she had no ID. This meant the pupil from Setlopo Village, near Mahikeng in North West, could not register for her final exams, nor apply for university or bursaries. It was already a year since she had applied and she was told different stories by Home Affairs officials, including that she was not born in Mzansi. But she had a birth certificate, and both her parents have ID books and were born here. Since she was in boarding school at Setlopo High School, her story was told to Daily Sun by her gogo, Penelope Dire (59). The SunTeam took it up with Home Affairs, and spokesman Thabo Mokgola assured us her ID book was being printed. Penelope waited for an SMS from Home Affairs for a month. When it did not come, she started getting nervous and went to the Mmabatho offices to find out where it was. The first official she spoke to said if they did not receive an SMS, then there was no ID. Gogo insisted that the manager speak to the SunReporter, and he kindly did so. When the SunTeam told the manager that Mokgola had said the ID was in print more than a month ago, he went to check for it on the shelves. And there he found a new smart card for Kelebogile! The pupil had to be fetched from school to sign for it herself, and she got the card. Now Kelebogile can look forward to her matric results and to a bright future. Penelope said: “Thank you very much, Daily Sun. “I had given up hope. But I knew when you stepped in, things would work out.”
