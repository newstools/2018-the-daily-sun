THIS is the time of year when many stokvels lose their money to thugs. But Masikhule Club in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, is one step ahead of criminals. Chairman Nokwayiyo Stena (43) said the stokvel asked the police to be present when they shared their groceries among themselves. “We’re grateful to the cops who made sure we were safe. “We didn’t know what they would say when we asked for increased police visibility when we share groceries,” she said. “We didn’t know they would stay and make sure we shared our groceries without having to look over our shoulder. “It would be a good idea for other stokvels to do what we did.” The group members each contributed R50 per week or R200 to R250 a month. At the end of the year, they buy groceries and share them. Stokvel member Sophumelela Khethabahle (31) joined the group because she wanted to buy school uniforms instead of groceries in December. “I want to buy the uniform now because they’re more expensive in January,” she said. Nyanga station commander Brigadier Vuyisile Ncatha said cops were used to assisting stokvels. “We accommodate them in our station while they share their savings. We encourage other clubs to approach police for protection,” said Ncata. He said police wanted to improve service delivery and establish trust between officers and residents.
