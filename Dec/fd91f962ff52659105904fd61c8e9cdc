FOR the fourth time this year Plastic View, east of Tshwane, has been hit by a fire. Many residents, some of whom are still recovering from previous fires, watched as more than 200 shacks burnt to the ground on Sunday night. More than 500 people were left homeless! The residents were woken by screams and whistles when the fire broke out. Maria Mtawarira (32) said she had been hit twice this year by fire. “If I could I would leave Plastic View. I can walk to work from here. If I had to leave I could not afford transport and rent.” She said the area might be cursed. “I lost my bed in the previous fire. I was sleeping on the floor with donated blankets. Now I will sleep on cardboard boxes.” Americo Bata (22) suspected the fire was started on purpose. He said the residents disciplined a man who was abusing his wife and the man threatened to do something terrible to them. “The fire started in his shack. I suspect he might have started the fire,” he said. Americo said he lost everything in the fire including money to travel to Mozambique for Christmas. “I had bought my daughter and three siblings Christmas clothes and presents. It has all burnt to ashes. I don’t want to go home anymore because I don’t want to see the disappointment on their faces.” Tshwane emergency services spokesman Johan Pieterse said there were no injuries. Pieterse said about 80% of the squatter camp was gutted by the fire, assisted by strong winds. “We’re still investigating the cause of the fire,” he said.
