LUFHUNO Ledwaba (29) apparently refused to share her bonus money with her jobless lover, and now she’s dead! Cops are looking for the lover, who has been on the run for two weeks. “He wanted her to give him her bonus money to pay a deposit on a car,” said Lufhuno’s brother Shando Madamalala. Shando (33) was with Lufhuno when she went to Kagiso to fetch her clothes and the boyfriend allegedly attacked her. “I tried to push him away but he came for me. There was no one to help us.” He claimed the suspect then went for his sister. Shando, who said he’s still recovering at home, told Daily Sun: “I’m hurt and my mum is devastated.” Captain Solomon Sibiya said cops were looking for the suspect. Cases of murder and assault were opened at Kagiso Police Station. Sibiya said SunReaders with information should call their nearest police station.
