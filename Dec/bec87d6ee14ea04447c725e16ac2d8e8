HOME Affairs has announced new travel requirements for kids going through South African ports of entry. From this month, certain categories of child travellers won’t have to present supporting documents. But travellers are still urged to carry the documents as they may be requested in certain cases. Even though showing these documents no longer is absolutely necessary, travellers are strongly advised to do so. Home Affairs said: “The changes took effect on Saturday, before the festive season, when many parents and families go on holiday with children. “The requirements put into practice the Children’s Act of 2005, which says minors travelling in or out of the country must do so with the consent of both parents. “The department has trained immigration officials to apply these changes. “These amendments were made in terms of the Immigration Act, in consultation with the Immigration Advisory Board.” The changes are in line with the economic recovery plan.
