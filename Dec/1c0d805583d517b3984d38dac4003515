THE last weekend of 2018 ended on a sour note for residents of Powerline squatter camp in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth. A man was killed in a blaze that destroyed three shacks on Saturday night. Residents said the man broke into a shack and slept there while the owner was visiting relatives. Bonakele Dama, a witness, said by the time residents woke up it was too late to save the man. “We were all asleep. Residents woke up when they heard passers-by saying the shack was on fire. “The man inside the shack was screaming for help. When he went silent we knew he was dead,” said Bonakele. Mongi Mkabane (60), the father of the man who owned the shack, said residents called him when the fire broke out. He said it would cost about R5 000 to build another shack. “I don’t know the person who died in the shack. My son won’t have a place to live when he returns. “He can’t live with me because I live with my sister in a crowded house in NU10. There are about 10 people in that house,” said Mongi. Mteteleli Klaas (43), whose shack was also destroyed, said: “My wardrobe was destroyed while we were removing furniture during the fire. Most of my household goods were damaged by the fire, so I’ll have to throw them away.” Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said: “The fire was first noted by a neighbour who alerted others, but they failed to put it out it because it became too strong. “It was eventually extinguished by the fire department. “Sivuyile Silumko (36), the man who died, was not supposed to be in the shack as it did not belong to him. He was apparently identified by his father. An inquest docket was opened.”
