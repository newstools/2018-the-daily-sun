BEACHGOERS who flocked to Durban for the festive season said they were pleased with the high police visibility. Nomfundo Sibiya (33) from Lamontville, south of Durban in Durban said she had been to the beach four times since the beginning of this month and hadn’t come across any thugs. “I think the cops are doing a great job in preventing crime. I used to be scared to come to the beach during this time of the year because thugs robbed people. But it’s different this year. There are a lot of police and I feel safe,” she said. Nthabiseng Moloi (45) from Joburg said she came to Durban with her children and they would be spending all their time at the beach. “So far we’ve seen police everywhere, even at shopping malls. This gives us peace of mind. I’ve visited Durban before but I’ve never seen so many cops patrolling. I think they did a good job by bringing more police,” she said. KZN cops spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said it had been quiet since the holidays started. “We can’t reveal the number of cops, but thugs don’t have a chance to rob anyone at this point,” said Zwane. Meanwhile, Police Minister Bheki Cele visited Durban beaches on Wednesday. He said the number of people arrested in connection with political killings in the province could fill up a bus! Cele said the task team investigating political killings would reveal the outcomes during a media briefing after 4 January. He claimed that there had been a lot of improvement so far as several people have been arrested.
