It seems like the woes are never-ending in Flex Rabanyan’s neck of the woods. The rapper and winner of Vuzu’s Hip-Hop reality show, The Hustle, has exposed himself for paying payola to a Metro FM employee. The rapper was under the impression that he was exposing the employee and by extent, the station for allegedly taking payola from artists who seek airplay.

Social media quickly ridiculed him for paying the money and then being brave enough to splash it all over social media. Even fellow rapper, Reason jumped in to let Flex know that he was less than smart for this move. He also said that he was actually worried about Flex. ICYMI: FLEX RABANYAN ALLEGEDLY ARRESTED FOR A CAR HE WON! “So... in other words... we wouldn’t know about this if your song was play-listed. This is like telling the cops about the robbery YOU GUYS did because your friend didn’t give you your cut. I’m really worried about you Flex,” Reason said. “This is hilarious. That guy is not exposing anything but HIMSELF for not getting anything out of a crime HE committed,” Reason continued. Can someone spell FACTS? Of course, all of this comes after Flex was arrested in January this year because the car that he won as part of his The Hustle prize package was not in his name. VUZU DENIES KNOWLEDGE OF FLEX RABANYAN’S ARREST! Flex claimed that Opel SA gave him a car that was registered under someone else’s name. Needless to say, Vuzu denied any knowledge of this mess.
