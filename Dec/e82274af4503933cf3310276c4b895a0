THE overloaded 22-seater minibus taxi travelling from Zimbabwe to Cape Town never reached its destination. The passengers’ journey ended when the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter collided with a truck on the N1, about 45 km outside Bloemfontein, on Saturday. Eight passengers, four adults and four kids , died at the scene. Nearby construction workers were shocked by what they witnessed. A worker said the accident apparently happened after the drivers had switched turns. “One of the victims said the taxi drivers swapped seats a few kilometers before the accident happened. It is alleged the new driver fell asleep and drove into the oncoming lane. “It is sad that many lives were lost,” said the man. Free State traffic spokeswoman Hilary Mophethe said the crash happened at about 4.45am. “The truck driver said the taxi drove into oncoming traffic. It is suspected that the taxi driver fell asleep due to fatigue,” said Mophethe. “Four children and four adults died at the scene. “The taxi driver was airlifted to a nearby hospital and the truck driver was not harmed. “We urge drivers to eliminate human errors. They should rest and reduce speed. “The 22-seater was overloaded, with 34 passengers.” Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane said the taxi was travelling from Harare to Cape Town. “A case of culpable homicide will be opened and registered at Tierpoort Police Station.” Mondli Mvambi, a spokesman for the provincial health department, said MEC Montseng Tsiu sent her condolences to the affected families. “Three sustained critical injuries and four sustained moderate injuries. Sixteen sustained minor injuries.”
