PORT St Johns second beach, which has become notorious for its festive season drowning incidents, has claimed another life. A 36-year-old man from Corona drowned on Sunday while celebrating a year-end work function. The latest drowning comes shortly after a boy and a girl drowned at the same beach during a farewell party two weeks ago. Police spokeswoman Captain Nozuko Handile confirmed the drowning. She said three men were swept away by the strong currents while swimming at the beach. “Two of the men were saved by lifeguards who were on duty, but the third man could not be found,” said Handile. She said the body had not been recovered at the time of going to print.
