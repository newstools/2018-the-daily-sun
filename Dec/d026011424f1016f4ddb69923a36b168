TWO police constables have been arrested for stealing money where
they conducted a raid. They were arrested following an investigation into a theft
complaint after their unit executed a raid in Mitchell’s Plain. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said the two
constables, a 35-year-old male and a 38-year-female, are accused of stealing
money from a residence in Peugeot Street Beacon Valley. The complainant discovered that cash was taken from a safe
in his house after they had left and reported the matter to police. Van Wyk said it is also alleged that the two constables
approached the complainant again on 2 December 2018 and requested him to
withdraw the case against them in return for the stolen money. “The two suspects are detained until their court appearance
in Mitchells Plain on Thursday 6 December 2018 on a charge of theft,” Van Wyk
said. “The Provincial Commissioner of the Western Cape police,
Lieutenant General KE Jula says they will not allow any form of corruption to
seep through the Unit members.” “No SAPS member is above the law, and we will not allow any
of our members to perpetrate a crime and get away with it.  We are confident this morning’s arrests will
send a stern warning”, says Lieutenant General Jula.
