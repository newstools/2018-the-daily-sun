WHEN Marvel Mathebula walked into his sister’s house, he was greeted by blood! He instantly knew something was wrong and thought the blood on the floor and walls could be his sister’s. He looked around the house, but Irene Mathebula (35) was nowhere to be found. Her live-in lover Max Harevula was also missing. He called the cops. He also found a metal object, which looked like a weapon of assault. Cops tried to contact the boyfriend, but his phone was off. Neighbours claimed they heard a woman’s cries for help at their rented house in Greenfield inEssellen Park, Tembisa. They also claimed to hear gunshots going off. Marvel said: “When I first got there my sister’s boyfriend refused to let me inside the house. He was edgy and I could see he was hiding something. I told him I was leaving but would come back. “Later neighbours told me they saw him leaving in his white Toyota Quantum.” Captain Johannes Molokomme said: “At this stage the two are still missing. A missing person’s case was opened. Anyone with information can contact Lieutenant Colonel Andre Potgieter on 082 241 6879.”
