OVERLOADED vehicles that are not roadworthy will be pulled off the road this festive season. Mpumalanga community safety MEC Pat Ngomane said overloaded vehicles heading towards ports of entry had become a common sight during the holiday season. Light delivery vehicles and minibuses with overloaded trailers will be stopped and taken off the road. “Overloading and unroadworthiness may lead to deadly crashes. “Their safety is affected so that in case of emergencies, the drivers may not be able to stop immediately. “Tiredness is another factor that leads to many people losing control and crashing, losing their lives and killing others on the road. “Drinking and driving during the holidays is an issue that should receive special attention,” he said. The provincial traffic police will have static road blocks on the routes that previously had the most crashes during the holidays. “These routes are key because they link Mpumalanga to Limpopo, Gauteng, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal. Some of them also carry large traffic volumes as they link South Africa to neighbouring countries.” Ngomane said another focus area would be on moving traffic offences such as dangerous overtaking, speeding, using cellphones while driving, and ignoring traffic lights and stop signs. Alcohol testing will target drunk motorists, while there will also be pedestrian safety campaigns and rest stops to help long-distance drivers rest during trips. The MEC has pleaded with traffic cops to work without fear or favour so that traffic offenders will face the consequences of their dangerous behaviour. He said those whose vehicles had defects or did not have valid documents should not take chances but stay where they were or use other transport. Ngomane called for all road users to play their part so that with increased tolerance levels among road users, crashes will be reduced. “Motorists should be patient because roads are shared spaces and traffic cops cannot be on every stretch of the road,” he said.
