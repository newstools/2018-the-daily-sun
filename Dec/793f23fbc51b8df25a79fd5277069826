HER BIOLOGICAL father first raped her in 2006 when she was 14, and when she died five years later the family thought the case could be lost. But the horror story ends with a small ray of sunshine. ALMOST A DECADE LATER, JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE! The verdict came on Friday in the Malamulele Regional Court in Limpopo. Takalani Mudau of Vuwani, the girl’s 61-year-old father, was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. Her attacker will spend the rest of his life in jail. The teenager’s ordeal started when her parents divorced and the 14-year-old girl visited her father. It was during those visits that he raped her at his business in Thohoyandou. The mum only discovered that she was raped after the young girl fell pregnant. When the mum enquired about the pregnancy, she heard that the girl’s father was the one who made her pregnant. A case was opened and the father was arrested in 2009. A baby boy was born out of the pregnancy. Then the girl died in 2009 after a short illness when she was 16 and many thought it would harm the case. The father was mentioned as a main suspect and he appeared in court but was released on technicalities. But that was not the end of the story. The girl was dead, but the resolve of the investigating officer was strengthened and she wanted to see justice being done. The detective work continued. DNA testing on the boy proved that the old man was his father. Acting Thohoyandou cluster commander, Brigadier Willie Mashava, said the sentence was an achievement for the cops and a victory for the women and children of South Africa. He praised the investigating officer and her unit. “This will definitely send a strong message to the community out there that the abuse of women and children will not be tolerated and that all who do it will end up in prison,” he said.
