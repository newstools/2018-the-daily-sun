PIG’S head is a much-loved dish in Mzansi. But the pig’s head which residents found lying on Eufees Road in Khayelitsha kasi, Mangaung, was not the eating kind. No one dared touch it or take it home for the pot, as the hog’s head appeared to be bewitched – even dogs avoided it! Puleng Sempe (37) said the head had been lying on the road for more than a week. “I saw the huge pig’s head last Saturday when I was visiting my friend. I thought about taking it home and cooking it for my family, but my instincts warned me. “I asked myself why someone else had not taken it. We all love meat and this is one of the best si-shebos for pap,” said Puleng. “There must be something wrong with that meaty head.” Simon Molaba (42) said his daughter spotted the pig on her way to school. “She said there was a pig head lying on the road and no one was picking it up. At first I thought it was meat for me and my family. “I went to take it, but then I was struck with a strange fear. “In fact I do not want to talk about that head any more. No one in the kasi wants anything to do with it because we think it is bewitched!” Sangoma Mamoya Rakauoane from Botshabelo said the residents should continue to ignore the mysterious pig’s head. “It could be that the pig had muthi applied to it for different reasons. “That explains why everyone is scared of it.”
