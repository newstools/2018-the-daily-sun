A 36-YEAR-OLD man has been arrested by the Hawks for soliciting a bribe of R100 000 for a tender. The suspect was arrested on Monday evening at the Sasol Garage along the N1 outside Polokwane. The man who reported the fraudster to the Hawks said he had applied for a tender to provide security services at schools around the province. He said he received a call from the suspect, who claimed to be a department of education employee. He notified the Hawks, and when the suspect asked for a bribe they set up a trap and pounced on him. Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said: “A sting operation was arranged and the suspect was arrested for extortion and corruption. “Our investigations into the matter are still ongoing.” The suspect will appear in the Polokwane Magistrates Court soon. The education department said the man was not one of their employees. Limpopo education spokesman Sam Makondo said: “The department would like to warn members of the public not to fall for such scams, as tenders are not for sale, nor are they awarded on the basis of bribes. “No money is required for the processing of any tender.”
