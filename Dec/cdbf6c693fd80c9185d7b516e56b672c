CHRISTMAS Day ended sadly for the Tsotetsi family. This after their daughter Kananelo (10) went missing. Kananelo had been sent to fetch cold water from her gogo’s place. But she never returned. Her mum Agnes (34), said it was around 2pm when she last saw her daughter. She told Daily Sun she regretted sending Kananelo to fetch water. This despite her gogo’s place being a street away from them in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni. “I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. My mind is not functioning properly,” said Agnes. She said they had just finished preparing Christmas lunch and were about to make juice. That’s when Agnes sent Kananelo to ask for cold water. Kananelo’s aunt Rachael Sithole said: “We have been up and down asking people if they’ve seen her. No one is giving us any clear answer. “The most frustrating thing is that this happened in broad daylight. It’s impossible that no one didn’t see anything,” said Rachael. She said Kananelo was wearing a white sleeveless dress and black shoes when she went missing. Police spokesman Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said a missing person case was opened and was under investigation.
