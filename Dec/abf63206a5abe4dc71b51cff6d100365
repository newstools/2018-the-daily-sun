FIERY lightning struck through Mpumazi Village in Eshowe, northern KZN, in the middle of the day on Friday last week and left two families in great distress. It killed Fezile Myeza (17) and Mfundo Mnyandu (12). Mfundo was struck by lighting while walking along a dirt road. Fezile’s brother Sibongiseni (21) told Daily Sun they were sitting in their house when the lighting struck. “Fezile was sitting next to me, and when the lightning struck it went straight to her,” said Sibongiseni. “She fell on the floor. The other children ran out of the house. I tried to wake her up but she wasn’t moving.” He said he ran out to get help from neighbours. “The neighbours came but it was already too late. Fezile had died,” he said. Immediately after the lightning struck heavy rain started pouring and damaged several houses, leaving several people homeless. Some of the villagers sustained injuries when their houses collapsed. One of the injured was 98-year-old gogo Thinaba Mabaso, whose house collapsed on her. She’s in hospital. Affected villagers are trying to rebuild their homes. Councillor Sipho Dlamuka told Daily Sun he was working on getting help for the villagers who lost their homes. “The rain has affected many villagers,” said the councillor. “I’m getting help for them, and I want to send a message to anyone who might assist with donations to come forward,” he said. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said two inquest dockets were opened at Eshowe Police Station.
