THE 13-year-old’s family is shattered by her death. Londeka Dladla (13) from Mayville in Durban was found dead last Wednesday after she collected her school report. She apparently failed grade 8. Her aunt, Duduzile Mkhize (56), said they heard from Londeka’s schoolmate that she killed herself because she failed. She said she was heartbroken by Londeka’s decision to end her life. Duduzile said she had been looking after her since she was a year old after her mum’s death. “I was hoping she was going to grow up and do something good I would be proud of, but she decided to cut her life short. “The amount of sadness I feel cannot be measured in words,” Duduzile said. She said she supported Londeka and another child as she did not have kids of her own. “When she killed herself, I was at work but I would not have punished her when I discovered she had failed,” Duduzile said. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “Allegedly at about 5pm last Wednesday, a 13-year-old girl was found hanged at her home in Cato Manor. “Cato Manor police are investigating the circumstances around the incident,” Zwane said.
