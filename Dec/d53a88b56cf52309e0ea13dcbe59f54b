ON WEDNESDAY train commuters at Pienaarspoort Station in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, had to find other transport or walk – because there was no electricity. Some told Daily Sun they had to walk, otherwise they would use up all their savings on alternative transport. Andrew Moloi (56) said: “We don’t want to use the cash we saved for Christmas to pay for transport.” He said officials told him to get a train at Mamelodi Gardens, which is the next station. Andrew said he did not have money to take a taxi, leaving him with no choice but to walk to that station. Priscilla Nare (45) said they bought monthly tickets. “Metrorail does not even bother to get us buses to the trains. “We have to walk long distances to get there and it is not safe.” People said they would have a bad Christmas because of unreliable trains. They are tired of breakdowns because there is no power, and also said train accidents put their lives in danger. Metrorail spokeswoman Lillian Mofokeng said electrical failure led to the trains not operating.
