Durban music tycoon, DJ Tira has hit the big one million mark. That is, the unstoppable hit-maker has reached the one million follower mark on Instagram. This comes as no surprise as Tira is one of the most influential people in African music, with an empire that keeps churning out hit after hit, turning ordinary musicians into super stars. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise to you to learn that this isn’t his first one million follower milestone. Malume’s Twitter page currently sits at 1.26 million followers. This puts him comfortably in the league of the most followed people in Mzansi alongside Bonang Matheba, Black Coffee and Nomzamo Mbatha among others. The Afrotainment boss still retains his humble charm though, thanking his fans for their loyal support. “Thank you for the love & support. It means a lot to me. Let’s keep going, he said. It is quite apt that he would reach this milestone in December as the month has come to be known as belonging to Tira and the Durban House/Gqom music fraternity so all the focus is always on him in this season. No Rush its Happy Days all the way to 2019 ?? A post shared by  djtira (@djtira) on Dec 11, 2018 at 9:01am PST  1 Million followers. We stay strong. Thank you for the love & support.
