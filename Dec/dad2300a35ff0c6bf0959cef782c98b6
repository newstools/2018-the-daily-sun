MATSHIDISO Motsoeneng is nursing her injuries after she was allegedly attacked by a cop’s wife on Sunday. The 24-year-old from Thokoza, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun that the cop, who works for EMPD, allegedly instructed his wife to beat her up after an argument. “He called her and said, ‘come beat this girl for me,’ ” claimed Matshidiso. She said she was trying to park her car in the yard at her boyfriend’s place. “He stopped next to me and started yelling at me.” Matshidiso said she yelled back. “That is when he drew his gun and told me he was going to kill me and show me my mother.” She said she did not know the man was a traffic cop, because he was wearing casual clothes and driving an old BMW 325. “I thought he was a thug because of the way he was swearing and the car that he was driving.” She said she was very scared. She went home and told her sister what had happened. When she described him, her sister said the man was a cop and suggested they go to his house and settle the matter in a civilised way. “When we got there my sister greeted him nicely and he responded well. But when he saw me, he started getting aggressive,” said Matshidiso. Another argument started and that is when the cop apparently told his wife to beat Matshidiso up. Matshidiso said as she was being roughed up, she was held back when she wanted to defend herself. She said instead of stopping the fight, the cop allegedly threatened people who tried to intervene. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele confirmed that a case of common assault had been opened. He said the cop and his wife appeared in court on Wednesday. They will appear again soon.
