THE hunt is on for a man who allegedly attacked Lerato Kganyago. Gauteng cops have confirmed that the businesswoman and radio personality opened a case after she was attacked on Christmas Eve. Captain Kay Makhubele told Daily Sun the assault case was opened at Honeydew cop shop. “Investigations are under way. No suspect has been arrested,” he said. Lerato posted a series of tweets about her alleged horrific experience after she was allegedly assaulted at Pick n Pay in Featherbrooke Village in Ruimsig, west of Joburg. She tweeted: “I just got strangled by an Afrikaans man in the middle of a retail store at Featherbrook centre after his wife called my helper a k*****. It was unprovoked and I approached her about it. “Why these people get away with such things still baffles me! This Afrikaans man put his hands around my neck in front of everyone. I just want the footage! I want that man arrested! What happened today is not about me but about those who’ve faced countless incidents like this day in and day out and felt powerless to stand up.”
