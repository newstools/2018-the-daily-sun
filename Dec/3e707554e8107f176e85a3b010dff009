Orlando Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic has urged his players to build on their good showing in the second half the season, as they prepare to challenge for silverware on three different fronts. The Buccaneers occupy second place in the Absa Premiership standings at the halfway mark, trailing league leaders Wits by just three points. In addition to their strong performance in the league, Bucs have also progressed to the group stages in the CAF Champions League and the last 16 in the Nedbank Cup. And, Sredojevic has been impressed with his side's strong finish to 2018, having made a somewhat stuttering start to the 2018/19 campaign. "I believe we have worked very hard to get to where we are after a shaky start," he is quoted as saying by Soccer Laduma website. "We've done very well, but it could be better. The first half of the season is like a springboard for the second half so that whatever worked you keep it up and upgrade and whatever was wrong you drastically change and improve. "We now have this festive period break, but we want to use it to rejuvenate ourselves, so we can come back and work hard." He added: "We will have a minimum of 22 or up to 32 matches if we go through in all the competitions. As Pirates we always have the highest ambition in all competitions – and we have three ahead of us. "We will do our best to have a successful and competitive season." SOURCE: SPORT24
