DEVASTATED families whose village was hit by a hailstorm in Ncambele Village, Mthatha, are struggling to come to terms with their loss. Simphiwe Mhlungulana (40) said he built a two-roomed mud house for him and his two kids. But on Saturday evening his house collapsed to the ground because of the storm. He said he did not know how he would rebuild because he survived on piece jobs. “I am not working. Although I have security guard qualifications, I am struggling to get employment. The collapse of my house has left me shattered. Now I have to start from scratch,” he said. Simphiwe said he was preparing to sleep when the storm destroyed his house. He told Daily Sun when the incident happened, he was fortunately in a temporary structure. The structure was donated to him. “The structure was also shaking as if it would also collapse. I still fear it might collapse because it has holes,” he said. He said he hoped government would help the affected villagers. Another villager, Ntombikayise Maguma, who lives in Cape Town, lost her room. Her neighbour, Nosibabalo Diko, said they were shocked when they saw the damage. “I called Ntombikayise after I saw the damage. She told me she was coming back to fix the damage,” said Nosibabalo. Municipal spokesman Ayongezwa Lungisa said he was in a meeting when Daily Sun called for comment.
