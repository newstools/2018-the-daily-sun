"I never meant to kill her. She is my daughter." So says an Eldorado Park mother who is out on bail, after being arrested for killing her daughter earlier this week. A visibly shaken and chain-smoking Veronica Raquel Dunn, 48, explained to News24 on Friday how she had snapped and stabbed her drug addicted daughter Venolia Avend, 24. Venolia was killed on Tuesday morning. Her unemployed mother appeared in the Protea Magistrate’s Court the following day, and was granted R2 000 bail. Dunn insists that the stabbing was not premeditated, but happened on the spur of the moment. The fatal incident occurred after Venolia demanded food parcels from her mother so she could sell them to buy drugs.       "I pushed her out and locked the bedroom door with Ashadine. She kicked down the door, wanting to attack us. She finally entered and charged at me and her sister. She held me by my throat for a while, choking me, and I pushed her back. "She went for her sister and grabbed her too. Venolia then went for a knife, which was on the floor, wanting to stab her sister. I quickly dived for it and I don’t know what happened later," she said, sobbing. Dunn stabbed her daughter once in the back. A neighbour rushed Venolia to a fire station for medical assistance, but she died there. 'I never meant to kill her' "I had to save my life and my Ashadine’s. I never meant to kill her. It was a snap of a moment and can’t forgive myself. I killed my daughter that I loved. I was shocked and still don’t believe. I then handed myself over to the Eldorado Park police. "The incident still lingers in my mind. I am battling to sleep. I miss her, especially in the morning, when she used to arrive here asking for 50 cents or R2. She was my daughter and she will always be my daughter and I will always love her. "I hope what happened here is an eye opener to many parents who live with drug addicted children. My daughter had brought trauma and many bad memories in my life. I am not proud of what I did. All parents faced by a similar situation must seek help before things get out of hand," she said. 'She was stealing everything in my house' Dunn said Venolia had dropped out on school in Grade 7 because of her drug addiction.         A movie was recently released about Pakkies’ life.  Message of support are also pouring in for Dunn. She is expected back in the Protea Magistrate’s Court next week, a day after the burial of her daughter. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mother-tells-how-she-stabbed-her-drug-addicted-daughter-to-death-i-never-meant-to-kill-her-i-had-to-save-my-life-20181214
