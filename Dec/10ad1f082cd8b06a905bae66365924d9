Giovanni Solinas says Kaizer Chiefs did more than enough to win their Absa Premiership clash with Golden Arrows on Saturday. Two Limbikani Mzava penalties settled the tie, with the player on target from the spot in the first-half. Only Leonardo Castro was on target for Amakhosi with his goal on the hour mark for a 2-1 result. After the game, Solinas said that Amakhosi were undeserved of not getting a victory at the Princess Magogo Stadium, in Durban. He told SuperSport: "We don't deserve to lose this game. We dominated completely the game. We don’t deserve to lose. "You watched the game? How many chances did we create? How many chances did the opponent create? We dominated completely the game. "I don’t want to talk about the penalty [penalties] and the referee. The opponent did not create nothing, two counter-attacks, two penalties we lose the game. This is football. "Football is simple, I don't want to talk about the individual performance or the departments. We lose together, we win together. "We made silly mistakes. Normally in professional football we pay cash for these silly mistakes. We need to pay attention and not make silly mistakes. We'll continue to work hard."
