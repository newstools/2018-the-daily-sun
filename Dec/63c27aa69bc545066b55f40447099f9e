ANOTHER suspect in the murder of Parks Khaiyane (40) has been arrested and appeared in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court yesterday. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the suspect’s accomplices, aged 22 and 24, were arrested on Thursday and appeared in court on Christmas Eve. Their case was postponed to 4 January and they will remain in custody. Daily Sun published the story of the brutal murder of the outspoken Khaiyane on Wednesday. The well-known ANC leader in Sedibeng in the Vaal died in a hail of bullets two weeks ago. It has not been confirmed whether the hit was politically motivated or was just a random attack, but sources told Daily Sun he was followed. Khaiyane, a member of the Gauteng Legislature, his 22-year old driver, and a 36-year-old woman were travelling on the R59 near Meyerton when they had car trouble. A mechanic was working on the car when they were attacked by five armed men. Khaiyane was a member of the EFF before he crossed over to the ANC. Makhubele said the victims were apparently robbed of their cellphones, cash, clothing and other items after being stripped naked. “Two suspects are at large and police are appealing to anyone with information to report at their nearest police station,” Makhubele said.
