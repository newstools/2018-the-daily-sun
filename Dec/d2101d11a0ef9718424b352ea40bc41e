THE SABC has dismissed reports that CEO Madoda Mxakwe has quit. But the public broadcaster could not confirm speculation that three board members had resigned. SABC spokeswoman Neo Momodu said the broadcaster has noted media reports speculating that three members of the board had resigned. “The relevant and correct authority to comment on SABC board resignations is the presidency. The SABC can, however, confirm that group CEO Madoda Mxakwe has not resigned. “Therefore, speculation on his resignation is false,” said Momodu. The Presidency could not be reached for comment, but the DA said board members John Mattison and Khanyisile Kweyama had indeed resigned. “At this stage it appears no official resignation letters have been sent to the SABC, parliament or the president. We can also confirm there has been no third resignation yet,” said DA MP Phumzile van Damme According to reports, the board members tendered their resignations due to political pressure over planned retrenchments. They said this was after a bitter meeting between Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams and the board. City Press reported that Ndabeni-Abrahams had threatened to report the board to President Cyril Ramaphosa and parliament. “The board received a blistering letter from the minister on Saturday morning after a tense meeting at the SABC on Thursday, where insiders say the minister demanded an end to the retrenchments,” reported the newspaper. The broadcaster announced a cut of over 2 000 jobs – 980 permanent staff and 1 200 freelancers. This is an attempt to tackle the broadcaster’s ongoing financial crisis. Unions including the Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers’ Union said employees were not consulted and that retrenchments were not necessary.
