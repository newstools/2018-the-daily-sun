THE HAILSTORM didn’t just fall out of the sky on Saturday, it was sent by an angry river serpent to create havoc at Sun City. This is the opinion of many people living in the area around the resort near Rustenburg, North West. Cultural and traditional philosopher, Grace Masuku from Moruleng near Sun City, said the stories were true. She said she was part of the delegation that negotiated the land the resort was built on when Bophuthatswana was founded in 1977. She said management had angered the river snake. Masuku said: “This is the first time an incident of its kind has happened. “People should question themselves and find answers.” Speaking from her home, she said the original name of the area was Itlho la Noga, which means eye of the snake. “What happened at Sun City is true. “The owner of the place, who is in a form of a snake, is angry and this is what caused the destruction.” “We told the people not to build in that area as it is sacred. There are things that need to be done to appease the owner of the land. Had they listened, this would not have happened.” The respected 87-year-old gogo said the situation could be fixed if the landowners came and talked to the snake. The land belongs to the Bakgatla Ba Kgafela people as the claim falls on this part of the Pilanesberg. The mountains are named after the Pilane royal family of Moruleng. “What happened on Saturday is the land starting to go back to its original form when there were no buildings on it,” said Masuku.
