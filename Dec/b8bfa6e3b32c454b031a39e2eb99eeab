FOUR Mthatha youths dug deep into their pockets to fund their dream. Khanyiso Ndamase, Yanga Mtintweni, Sonwabise Mtwa and Thandiswa Girls are proud owners of The Slice Bakery. The bakery opened its doors three weeks ago. They deliver freshly baked bread to private clients, local spazas and even a hotel. Khanyiso, who quit his job as a production manager at a big retail shops, said they saw a gap in the market and went for it with a starting cost of more than R300 000. “We had to use money from our own pockets and even our savings but it was all worth it. This is a dream we wanted to see realised.” In a day, they make a 1 000 loaves and already have about 800 clients on their database. Before they opened the bakery in Northcrest, they used to buy bread from a local bakery and delivered it to their customers. The bakery’s already employed four permanent workers and their next step was to open branches across the province. Head baker Nkcubeko Notshutsha (27), who is a former taxi driver, said the opening of the bakery gave him a sense of purpose. “I now have a stable job. I once worked at a pizza outlet. I first learned to bake through YouTube videos, but got proper training.”
