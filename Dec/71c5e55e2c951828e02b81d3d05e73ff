WHEN it rains, this woman and her family stay up all night. Mathapelo Majola (54) from Freedom Park in Soweto told Daily Sun that since 2010 they have been living in a house without a roof – and it floods whenever rain comes down. “I am diabetic and I cannot work because my condition is really bad. “I live in poverty and I need to take my pills,” she said. Mathapelo said the future of her son Thapelo Majola (21) was in the balance because he couldn’t study. “It is bad enough that he goes to school on an empty stomach, but when he comes back he needs to write his homework and assignments. “How can he do that if his room is like a dam? “I’m starving but Right now I need a roof more than anything else, because the rainy season is coming.” She said she never had the opportunity to go to school. I pray Thapelo’s life does not end up like mine,” she said. She said her husband Thamsanqa Majola (57) has been looking for work, but without any luck. “People promise him jobs but then they disappear,” she said. Mathapelo is pleading with SunReaders to help her put a roof over the heads of her family. “I still have six years and my husband three years before we qualify for pension,” she said. Mathapelo said if people want to help them with food that is very welcome but her main concern is a roof. “If I could afford a new roof I would buy it, but I cannot. Even the food we eat is from the church, so you can imagine that things are bad.”
