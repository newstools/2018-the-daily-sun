A MAN is struggling to recover after a vicious knee to
his groin by his ex wife resulted in him losing one of his balls. According to the Daily Mail, Vyacheslav Povetyev (29) and
Rimma Gayazova (27) were together in the Russian city of Kaliningrad last
weekend. Vyacheslav was visiting their son. They were going up in a lift together when they started
to argue. According to Rimma, Vyacheslav started the fight,
grabbing her by the neck and trying to take the child from her. She claims she defended herself by kneeing him in the groin. However, he ended up in hospital and she is facing a
criminal investigation. The force of the knee’s impact on his genitals was so
strong it ripped the scrotum and badly damaged one ball. Doctors were forced to remove the savaged ball. Rimma faces up to three years in jail if found guilty of “the
intentional infliction of moderate bodily harm”. Reports say that the ex-husband complained to police that
he had “became infertile and suffered psychological harm” after the incident
which left him “half castrated”.
