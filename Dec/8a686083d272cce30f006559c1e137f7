RESIDENTS of Pietermaritzburg in the KZN Midlands were forced to seek shelter after their houses were damaged by heavy storms on Tuesday. Ntombifikile Ntombela (45) from Snathing told Daily Sun she and her grandkids are lucky to be alive after strong wind blew the roof off their two-roomed house. “I thank God for giving me a sharp mind. I just knew I needed to run outside because one of the walls collapsed soon after the roof was blown off.” Nonto Magubane (31) from Ashdown said her uncle’s roof was also blown off. “Luckily, there was no one inside the house. But his furniture and groceries were destroyed when rain water flowed into his house.” Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said disaster management teams were sent to the affected areas. She urged residents to be cautious as rainstorms were expected across the province during the festive season. “The storm on Tuesday caused serious disruption as some roads could not be accessed, leading to huge traffic jams,” she said. “Efforts to clear up the rubble have commenced and are led by the uMgungundlovu and Msunduzi municipalities’ disaster teams.”
