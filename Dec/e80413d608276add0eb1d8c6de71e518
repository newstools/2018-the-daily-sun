FOR ten years, Mark Starling (57)
pretended he was investing money of  friends
and family, earning them a profit on the stock exchange. But instead, Starling was blowing the
cash on private school fees, flash cars, luxury holidays and property. According to Daily Mail, Starling even
convinced his own daughter, Rosalie (27) to hand him £8 500 (about R154 000) to
“invest”. A total of 17 people were duped by
Starling from Surrey in England, including his nephew. Starling tried to cover up his theft by
providing fake monthly statements after starting the scam in 2008. He only invested £8 000 (R145 000) of
the £3 million (about R54,3 million) he persuaded people to trust him with. One pensioner even had to go back to
work after Starling swindled him out of his retirement fund. Sentencing Starling earlier this month, Judge
Philip Bartle said: "He did not do a stroke of work over these years, he
didn’t do a stroke of lawful, gainful employment ... it was, in short, a pack
of lies over a very long period of time."
