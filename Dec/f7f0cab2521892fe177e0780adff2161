COPS have arrested another suspect in connection with the murder of councillor Sibusiso Maphumulo. Nkosinathi Mbambo (33) from Umlazi, KZN was bust on Monday. He appeared in the Umlazi Magistrates Court yesterday. He joined Phumlani Nojiyeza and ANC ward 80 councillor Mthokozisi Nojiyeza, who was bust last week. He faces charges of conspiracy to murder and murder of his colleague Maphumulo, who was the ward 88 councillor. His legal team, led by Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa, tried to convince the state to allow the bail hearing but the state said it wasn’t ready. The case was postponed to 3 and 4 January. The cases against two other suspects, Sandile Mvelase and Nkosingiphile Nojiyeza, were withdrawn. Daily Sun was reliably informed the two have turned state witness. Maphumulo’s wife Sithembile Mashabane told Daily Sun she never thought Mthokozisi would be accused of killing her husband as they were friends. His sister Phumzile Maphumulo said they were still shocked by Mthokozisi’s arrest. She said he knew her brother was the bread winner. Addressing supporters outside the court, ANC Youth League spokesman Mlondi Mkhize said he’s been reliably told the two suspects who’s charges were withdrawn have implicated a big fish who could be bust soon.
