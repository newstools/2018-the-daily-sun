IN addition to building a new clinic for the villagers, Kolomela
Mine has also committed to improving the hospital for the locals. Keaobaka Matilo of Anglo American’s Kolomela Mine
in Postmasburg, said the clinic is classified as an ideal facility by the
department of health. The
clinic which has been split from the hospital, has six consulting rooms, a
pharmacy, a reception area and a medication storage area. “We
have added children’s wards and we are now focusing on upgrading the hospital
itself. We prioritised the paediatric ward, the theatre and the casualty
section. “The
casualty section did not have enough beds for patients but that has also been
sorted out,” he said. Keaobaka said they constructed living units for doctors as well. “The
units are occupied by four doctors where they only had two or even one doctors
before.” Keaobaka
said they do an impact assessment every three years and realised there are many
social problems in the community. They’ve invested over R40 million in the project in Postmasburg
and for them it wasn’t about the money. “We are all about touching and changing lives. “We have also created hundreds of jobs. That
makes me sleep well at night,” he said.
