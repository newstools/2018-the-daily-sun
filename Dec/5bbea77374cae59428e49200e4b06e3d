TWO siblings burned to death on Christmas Day while their parents were having an argument with neighbours. The incident happened in Maqheleng kasi in Ficksburg, Free State. Thabisho (4) and four-month-old Rethabile Morubedi were left alone in a shack on Tuesday night. After their parents learnt their shack was on fire, residents helped put it out. But it was already too late. According to a resident, the couple were drunk and got into a heated argument with neighbours over beer. “I heard they were all sitting together and having lunch. But things soon changed from happiness to tears. “It seemed the neighbours stole some of the beer they were sharing. “The couple confronted them and were told by other neighbours there was a fire coming from their shack. “The children were inside the shack, crying, while residents tried to put out the raging fire. But despite all efforts, they couldn’t be saved.” The only exit was blocked by a door that fell during the fire. “The older boy was inside the shack watching TV while his sister was on the bed asleep. “I’ve never seen such a painful end to Christmas Day. The family lost everything they had and now are homeless.” Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said: “We’re investigating after two kids burned to death in their shack in zone 8. “A boy and his sister died while their parents were arguing with neighbours. At this stage it’s not known what may have caused the fire.” No one was arrested and investigations continue.
