MARITZBURG United’s departing midfielder, Siphesihle Ndlovu, has yet to make up his mind on agreeing personal terms with Mamelodi Sundowns. This comes after the clubs came to an agreement in principle that he could leave United at the end of the season. Sundowns signed Lebohang Maboe from the Team of Choice just before the season got underway and the club agreed in principle that Sundowns could sign Ndlovu, who would only leave when the current campaign ends. However, the player has been accused of not exerting much effort at training or during games. The club has reiterated that Ndlovu has not agreed personal terms with Sundowns yet, despite the clubs coming to an understanding. Club chairman Farouk Kadodia, who has done many a business deal with Sundowns, says the reigning PSL Midfielder of the Season should be given time to decide his own terms. “No, I’m not commenting on those stories until the player signs personal terms, then I can talk about it. We must give him time and space,’’ said Kadodia. Ndlovu was key for Maritzburg last season in the club’s record fourth place finish and also guided them to their first ever cup final, the Nedbank Cup, which they lost to Free State Stars. He made his Bafana debut in the hastily arranged Four Nations tournament held in Zambia in March. In addition to winning Midfielder of the Season, Ndlovu was also named Young Player of the Season at the PSL Awards. With Maboe already going to Sundowns, Ndlovu would join quite a list of players who had moved to Sundowns from United, such as Musa Nyatama, Rheece Evans, Cuthbert Malajila and Mario Booysen.
