Local media personality, Lalla Hirayama has opened up about the influence that her late grandmother had on her life and career. She did so on the night that she debuted her DJing career, which happened to be the anniversary of her grandma’s passing. That’s right, Lalla is now a club DJ and made her debut at Sumo Nightclub in Rosebank, Jozi this past week. On the night, she took to Instagram to speak about why she does what she does and the person who inspired her love of performance. “Last night was for gran. 3 years ago to the day she passed over to eternity. My love of art, music and dance was all because of you. You helped grow and nurture my love for performance in every way you could. My #1 fan. I wanted to debut on the same date you left me, as a tribute to the impact you still have on me as an evolving being. I am because you were. Alive in my heart forever,” the Ninja said in a tribute to her grandmother. Lalla has been in the entertainment industry for almost two decades now, having started off as a child star, then moving on to dancing, and all of the incredible work we now know her for.
