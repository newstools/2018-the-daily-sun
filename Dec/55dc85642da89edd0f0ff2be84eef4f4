A DEAD newborn was found floating in a river in Soshanguve block PP, Tshwane, on Wednesday. The discovery shocked residents, and sangoma Sophie Mndawe (40) was saddened. She pleaded with new mums not to throw away their babies. Sophie said seeing the baby broke her heart because she couldn’t have kids. “It’s unfortunate that those who’re able to have kids don’t want them,” she said. “I wish the mum could have given the baby to me and not dumped the innocent soul in the river.” The baby was found by passers-by floating in the water in the early hours of the morning. Sophie said there had been several pregnant women in the area, but they didn’t know who the mum was. “We assume the mum didn’t know who the dad was or was afraid to tell her parents,” she said. Resident Ntate Nkosi (34) said they suspected she was from another area. “This has never happened in our area before. “Maybe she thought no one would find the baby,” she said. Rietgat police spokesman Captain Stephen Maluleke confirmed the incident. “KwaMashu police are investigating a case of concealment of birth. No arrest has been made,” he said. Maluleka pleaded with residents to give cops information. Social development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said child abandonment was a crime. “They should go to their nearest social development offices or child protection organisations for guidance in terms of alternative care.”
