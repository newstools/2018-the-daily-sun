THE ANC in the Zululand District Municipality wants IFP mayor Thulasizwe Buthelezi to be removed through a vote of no confidence. This after the mayor employed a municipal manager on Thursday, although he was warned by Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube not to do so until the former manager’s court case had been finalised. In a council meeting on Thursday, the ANC and DA tried to block the council to discuss the matter, but the mayor forced it through and Mpumelele Manqele was approved as new manager. ANC chief whip Mxolisi Zulu told Daily Sun yesterday his party was preparing a motion of no confidence vote against the mayor. He said it had already started mobilising DA councillors to support it when he tables the motion, hopefully before Christmas. He said his party was also talking to IFP councillors, who were also unhappy. Zulu said he wrote to the MEC yesterday, requesting her to urgently place the municipality under administration. IFP chief whip Bheki Mncwango confirmed that a new manager had been employed and said he didn’t care about ANC’s vote of no confidence threat and wasn’t aware of IFP councillors who would support the motion. DA chief whip Sbu Nkosi said his party was fed up with the mayor and he had written to their provincial leadership and asked whether to support the ANC motion or not. The department’s spokesman, Lennox Mabaso, said that the MEC was monitoring the municipality. He said they hadn’t received any letter yet. The ANC has 11 seats in the municipality, the DA six and the EFF has one. The IFP, with 17 seats, controls council.
