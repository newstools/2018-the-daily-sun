TUMELO’s T-shirts show the faces of Mzansi legends. Tumelo Tsagane (24) from Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, said although people honour giants such as Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo, it was not enough. “I started designing these T-shirts because they aren’t being honoured as much as they should. “This is me trying to reach out to the youth and people who aren’t familiar with those people, so they can start paying attention.” The first-year University of Joburg strategic communications student said he had always wanted to go into business and sold sweets at the age of six. “I didn’t realise that being a businessman required skill. “I later realised it was easy for me, because I have a business mind and talent for art.” He started designing T-shirts in 2012. Tumelo said when he started his business, it wasn’t easy and he had financial problems. Things are better now. He has efficient suppliers. “I just needed to be disciplined,” he said. “I sometimes got money and ended up using it before buying material for my T-shirts. “I realised this wasn’t getting me anywhere and knew there and then I had to make some changes.” Tumelo said he got good feedback after he showcased his work at a fashion show in Tembisa in 2015. He said he was trying to promote local brands. “We need to grow local brands to be on the same level as Gucci and Nike,” said Tumelo. “Mzansi brands should grow in other countries,” he told Daily Sun.
