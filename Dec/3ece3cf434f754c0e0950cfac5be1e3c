FREE State Stars are rumoured to be chasing after the services of Nikola Kavazovic, current coach of Kenyan side AFC Leopards. Ea Lla Koto general manager Rantsi Mokoena is believed to have made contact with the Serbian coach in the hope of luring him to Mzansi as Luc Eymael’s replacement. Efforts to get clarity from Mokoena drew a blank as he’s believed to be out of the country and did not return SunSport’s calls. Eymael, who helped Stars win the Nedbank Cup last season, their first trophy in 24 years, is now in Egypt coaching El Geish FC. The Belgian left Stars sitting 11th in the league table with 13 points from 14 matches. Eymael’s assistant at the time, Selatse “Sly” Mosala, was called in as interim coach alongside long-serving David Vilakazi. They were in charge when Stars played to a goalless draw with Mukura Victory Sports of Rwanda in the Caf Confederation Cup preliminary stage last week. “Free State Stars are interested in Nikola Kavazovic and Rantsi is out of the country to have talks with him,” a source told SunSport. The 43-year-old Serbian coach won the league title in Botswana with Township Rollers last season, also setting new milestones by taking the club to the Caf Champions League group stages – a first time occurrence in Botswana football. Kavazovic, who was previously linked to the Kaizer Chiefs coach job in the off-season, has also coached in Sri Lanka and Tajikistan. But worryingly, Kavazovic only joined Leopards in October and it could cost Mokoena an arm and a leg to buy out his contract with Leopards.
