KHUZANI Mpungose is confident that what happened at the #FillUpMosesMabhida Stadium concert won’t happen at his #GcwalisaiMabhida show. The maskandi star will perform at the Durban stadium on 30 March. Speaking to SunBuzz, he said his show would be the opposite of what happened at Cassper Nyovest’s show on 1 December when the rapper failed to fill up the stadium. “I know that maskandi fans love and support their music. I’m confident they’ll do it for maskandi. “History will be made. We want to show other genres that maskandi is powerful and can do big things.” Khuzani said the line-up will be revealed on 14 January. “This is also the date when the tickets will go on sale. “We’re talking to all the partners including eThekwini Municipality. “We want the event to be known globally and put maskandi on the map. “It’s going to be big. Every maskandi fan and artist will be there.” When Khuzani hinted in September he was planning to fill up Mabhida, he shocked many by changing the theme from #FillUpMosesMabhida to #FullUpMosesMabhida. He told SunBuzz then he did that after hearing from his sources that Cassper, who had organised #FillUp Moses Mabhida, was planning to sue him if he went on using the #FillUp tag. He said Cassper had claimed it was his concept. He later changed the #FullUp theme to #Gcwalisa. Asked if he wasn’t worried that he might face the same challenges as Cassper, Khuzani said: “Please, don’t compare what Cassper did or went through with my plans. He had his own strategy and I have mine. “I trust maskandi fans because I know them. “I believe the fans will also behave well on the day. “It’s not about Khuzani but maskandi as a whole.”
