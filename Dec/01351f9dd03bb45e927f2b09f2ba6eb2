LAW student Walter Sefiri said it has become common practice for brides to evict the groom’s families. Walter fights for people whose homes have been hijacked – and he does this work for free! He is an agent for people who were unlawfully evicted. The former security guard told Daily Sun he wanted to be remembered as a human rights activist. Since 2016 he has helped 15 families around Joburg get their homes back. Walter said he first took part in property issues in 2013, which gave birth to his passion – helping those who had lost their homes. Because he had little knowledge of property law, he visited courts often to learn the legal in and outs. He said: “When I was not working I’d spend time at the courts listening to arguments, taking notes and reading books. “I started recommending lawyers to families and developed a passion for property law. I eventually enrolled for a law degree in 2016.” Walter said house hijackers were often relatives and brides. “They often target bigger families, orphans and homes headed by women,” he said. “These families lose their homes mainly because they cannot afford court fees.” Themba Sibisi’s younger brother was unlawfully evicted from their parents’ home in Zola, Soweto, 12 years ago. Walter rescued them. Themba (67) said the invader claimed to have bought the house on auction. Their furniture was thrown out onto the streets and new people in. They claimed to have seen the person who apparently owned the house only once, after which they transferred money to his account. “I’ve been struggling to find him, but I don’t care any more. I have my parents’ house back,” said Themba.
