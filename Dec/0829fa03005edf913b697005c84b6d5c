THE co-operative governance department has had a challenging yet productive year. Speaking in Tshwane yesterday about the progress made in their action programme, Minister Zweli Mkhize said most municipalities faced political, service delivery, financial management and governance problems. They identified 87 struggling municipalities needing urgent help to deal with governance, financial management, and service delivery issues. “National Treasury said 166 municipalities face serious financial challenges and 122 have unfunded budgets,” he said. To help struggling municipalities, they launched the municipal recovery and back to basics programmes. Since April, they had discussions with premiers, MECs, local government, traditional leaders and business. “Plans were finalised with clear targets, as well as service delivery improvements,” he said. “All municipalities managed to improve audit outcomes and manage public finances wisely.” Mkhize said the fraud and corruption cases would be addressed by police agencies. “The Hawks are investigating municipalities through the clean audit project,” he said. “Out of 311 cases, 98 are in court, 178 are under investigation and 35 finalised or withdrawn.”
