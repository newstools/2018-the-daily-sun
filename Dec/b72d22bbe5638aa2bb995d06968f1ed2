THUGS usually go all out during the festive season. But cops were one step ahead and bust 60 suspects in Limpopo, between Christmas Day and yesterday. The suspects, some of them alleged pimps and human traffickers, were aged between 18 and 32. They were arrested in various parts of the province. They face charges ranging from house robbery, possession of stolen property and unlicensed firearms and ammunition, to dealing in drugs and human trafficking. Limpopo cops spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said: “In the Polokwane cluster, five Chinese men were bust for human trafficking, dealing in prostitution, possession of suspected stolen goods and bribery. “The arrests were a result of a joint operation made up of specialised units. “During the arrests, goods with an estimated value of R100 000 were seized.” He said cops recovered several suspected stolen items from suspects in Makhado, Polokwane, Thohoyandou, Mankweng, Lephalale, Bela-Bela, Mahwelereng, Burgersfort, Bolobedu and Tzaneen. Limpopo police commissioner General Nneke Ledwaba said:  “We thank members of the community who continue to work closely with the police by providing reliable information which contributed immensely to these successes,” said Ledwaba. “All the suspects are still to appear before various magistrates courts.”
