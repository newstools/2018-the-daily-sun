SHE was happy to have a second son! But Lizzy Rambau’s happiness was short-lived after she made a shocking discovery. The 28-year-old from Atteridgeville, Tshwane, discovered that a copper intra-uterine device (a loop) was inserted into her uterus without her permission. She made the discovery on 20 November while she was taking a bath. Lizzy had been to Kalafong Hospital, where she gave birth on 18 September. She said she asked for a birth control injection., but what she discovered shocked her. “I never thought anything was inserted in me until the copper loop fell out while I was bathing,” said Lizzy. She said she did not know what the device was until she visited a doctor the next day. “He explained what it was and I was shocked because I had not asked for itNo one had asked me if I wanted it or not,” she said. Lizzy said she went to the hospital to lodge a complaint. “They gave me a note of confirmation of my complaint. “I hope they find the person who is responsible for this mess, so they can be punished. “I spent money going to the doctor,” she said. Lizzy wants the hospital to compensate her for the trauma she suffered. “They should start by giving me the money I spent on the doctor who explained this to me. “They put me through a lot of pain. I want them to pay for that,” she said. Gauteng Health Department spokesman Lesemang Matuka said they have forwarded Daily Sun’s inquiry to the hospital for investigation.
