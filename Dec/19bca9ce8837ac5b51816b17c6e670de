THE SA under-20 national team have successfully defended their Cosafa Youth Championship title after beating Zimbabwe 4-3 on penalties in a thrilling final in Kitwe, Zambia, yesterday. Amajita, playing in their fourth consecutive Cosafa cup final, held their nerve and emerged victorious in the lottery of the penalty shoot-out on their way to their second title in as many years. Goalkeeper Khulekani Kubheka saved two penalties allowing defender Keenan Abraham the chance to score the winning penalty and send Amajita to Cosafa cup glory. Coach Thabo Senong’s charges had to fight hard for victory having come from a goal down to send the match into penalties. Zimbabwe’s young warriors, who outplayed hosts Zambia to reach the final, were playing in the final for the first time in 11 years. They opened the scoring in the 64th minute through their top scorer Delic Murimba who punished Nkosingiphile Ngcobo’s poor back pass. Murmba’s goal was the first Amajita’s water tight defence had conceded in the entire tournament. Amajita pushed for an equaliser which came in the 86th minute through Orlando Pirates striker Lyle Foster. The Orlando Pirates striker bagged his fifth goal of the tournament with a neat sidefooot finish after excellent work on the left flank by eventual man of the match Promise Mkhuma. Amajita pushed for the winner in the dying minutes of the game, however, Zimbabwe’s young warriors held on. Amajita now turn their attention to the bigger test, the Africa Cup of Nations, set to take place in Niger next February. Senong had been using the Cosafa cup to prepare for the Afcon, where they will have to reach the semi-finals to book their spot in the Fifa Under-20 World Cup in Poland next year.
