A GROUP of about 500 residents of Mangaung marched to their municipal offices on Thursday. The march for service delivery was supported by the Mangaung Taxi Association, Young Communist League, Mangaung Progressive Forum, Mangaung Concerned Residents and the Patriotric Alliance. They handed over a memorandum. Mncedisi Bokwa, the organsier of the march, told Daily Sun: “Young people and people of Mangaung are not benefiting anything from the economy of Mangaung. There are issues related to nepotism and corrupt officials who manipulate employment procedures. They hire their lovers and relatives. “More than 70% of the people who work for the municipality are from outside the area.” He said sewage ran down the streets unattended and their roads were unfinished. Municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said: “Most of their grievances are reasonable and some need immediate attention. “I think there is a council sitting on Tuesday when we will deal with these issues. Most people do not pay for services and that makes it difficult for us to discharge our responsibilities.” He said the municipality had budget problems, but promised the memorandum would be given to the relevant people.
