ON FRIDAY, Nzame Primary School pupils in Phelindaba kasi, Bloemfontein were all smiles. Thusano Funeral Parlour and Old Mutual Group donated school shoes and lunch boxes to 50 pupils. Funeral parlour marketing manager Wongalethu Nodwele said: “We identified it as a needy school.

This is the first time we’re donating school shoes to Nzame Primary. But we’ve been donating to other schools in Smithfield, Ventersburg and Zastron. We want to adopt the school to ensure we take care of kids.” Principal Sephetho Skosana said: “This is a great day for our pupils. We’re developing them to be future leaders.
