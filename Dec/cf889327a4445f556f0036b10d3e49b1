THANDI said her husband wants a second wife. But she won’t agree to that. She said after 23 years of marriage, she’s happy that he can marry his nyatsi – but only after they get a divorce. “He told me only death will separate us,” Thandi Selahle (44) from Etwatwa in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun. “He said he will never agree to a divorce because he does not want to share our belongings.” Thandi claimed he mistreated her all their married life. “We met when I was 15 and I agreed to date him because I wanted to escape my life of poverty. But I entered into a life of hell!” She claimed his family called her names. “I struggled to raise our four children because he hardly bought anything for us.” She claimed she has been asking for a divorce but her husband won’t sign divorce papers because he does not want to split his money with her. “Two weeks ago he told me he has a nyatsi and is saving to marry her. I don’t want anything from him any more. Only a divorce.” But Phineas (53), the husband, said: “I was not aware that she wanted a divorce. I never thought of a divorce. But I have no reason not to allow her to have that.” He said he never wanted a second wife. “I don’t know where that comes from. She moved out of our home for many years and I raised the children until she came back this year. I welcomed her back and forgave her even though her behaviour has not changed. She spends nights out whenever she wants to. I think she only wants to destroy me.”
