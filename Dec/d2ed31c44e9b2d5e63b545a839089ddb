THE mums were happy when their kids came home with good report cards. But their joy turned to anger when they saw letters attached to the cards telling them the kids weren’t welcome at the school anymore. The kids had apparently outgrown their grades and had to enrol in night school or FET colleges. But the parents said their kids were too young to attend night school. The children are at Senzangakhona Secondary School in Mandela Village near Kwamhlanga, Mpumalanga. Letta Nkomo (46) said her daughter Portia Mahlangu (16) was in grade 8 and young enough. “In June the school gave us forms to fill in as confirmation that our children will still be at the school next year,” she said. “Where will we find space for them? I don’t have money for an FET college. We only survive on the kids’ social grants.” Gogo Paulinah Mashego (62) said her granddaughter Ofentse Mashego (16) had passed her grade 8, and if she didn’t go to the school she’d have to stay home. “I earn a pension and can’t afford to send her to college,” she said. Christina Malope (45) said her daughter Nthabiseng (19) was in grade 10 and didn’t know what to do. “Our kids are doomed,” she said. Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said they had requested a report from the district. He said the principal and SGB were had been reminded that only the head of department could expel pupils. A decision would be taken upon receiving the report.
