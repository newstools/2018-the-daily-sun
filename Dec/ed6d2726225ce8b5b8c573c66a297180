MTHOBISI Ntshangase’s wish is that his new album will motivate people. The gospel singer released his second album, Kanti Wena Ungubani, in October. He’s originally from Swaziland but now lives in Joburg. Mthobisi told SunBuzz he wanted the story behind the album to make people believe in themselves. “The title track, Kanti Wena Ungubani, was inspired by biblical story of David and Goliath,” said Mthobisi. “David was very young when he killed Goliath the giant. “That story always motivates me to look at all the things I’ve been through – the big things I’ve defeated and conquered because of God. “I want the album to motivate people not to give up because they can overcome anything through the Lord.” His love of music began in church, where he used to play the piano. “I started singing professionally when I was featured as a keyboard player on Apostle Maculuve’s album,” he said. “After the album went big I was approached by sound engineer Dennis Bothma in 2007. He taught me the basics of sound engineering.” In 2009 he moved to Mzansi to study sound engineering at Wits. In 2016 he released his debut album Sonini Nanini.
