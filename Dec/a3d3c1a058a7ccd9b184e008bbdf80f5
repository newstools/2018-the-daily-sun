EZILE Tsawe (13) loves Kaizer Chiefs and his dream is to meet Amakhosi players, especially Itumelang Khune. “I love Chiefs and my favourite player is goalkeeper Itumelang Khune. He is my role model. I would love to meet him one day,” he said. Ezile, from Qandu Qandu squatter camp in Green Point, Khayelitsha, was born with a spinal cord problem. Since he cannot use his legs, he uses his hands to play soccer. “I love soccer so much. That is why I use my hands to play,” said the beaming boy. His mum, Phindiswa (41), said even though Ezile lives with a disability, he is active and very healthy. “He is such a good son. He does not give me any problems. “I thank God for that,” Phindiswa said. The mum said kasi kids were more understanding of Ezile’s condition. “His friends always go with him to play soccer. They understand his condition and they are patient with him.” She said when his friends take him to the playground they use his wheelchair. “When they get there they put the wheelchair aside, so that Ezile can play soccer.” Phindiswa moved from Eastern Cape to Cape Town when she got a job in 2013. When the SunTeam asked if Ezile was attending school, she said: “My son attended Khwezilokusa Primary School, Mthatha in Eastern Cape. He only did grade 1. “I have been trying to get a school for him since we arrived, but with no luck. “I am on the waiting list. Maybe they will have space for him next year,” she said. Ezile said he hoped the People’s Paper would ensure that he met Chiefs players. “I pray my favourite team visits me. I look forward to meeting Khune. I trust it will now happen because of the power of Daily Sun,” said Ezile. Ezile wants to be a teacher. “I want to teach kids to understand people living with disabilities,” he said. Kaizer Chiefs spokesman Vina Maphosa said they would be happy to meet Ezile.
