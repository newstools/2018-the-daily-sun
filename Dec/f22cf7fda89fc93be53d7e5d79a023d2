GQOM is usually associated with hot pants and dance moves such as the vosho. But no one has ever associated it with a man of God. Yet it seems this “ungodly” music has touched one man of God. Bongani “G Millionaire” Gumede (32), a pastor from Umzimkhulu in southern KZN, has released his first gqom album, Siphila Butepu. But the news was not received well by some members of his congregation, who believed this would taint his healing powers. “This is not the way for a pastor to behave. We trust him with our lives and depend on his healing. “Why does he want to associate himself with music that makes youngsters not want to sleep at home?” asked one congregant. G Millionaire was not having any of this and believed gqom was also a God-given talent. “What people don’t know is that I have been in music for a while now and it is not a talent I can just throw away. I have sung scathamiya and gospel, but now I want to explore this genre,” he said. “I’m talented and people should not worry at all. My healing powers are not going anywhere and I will forever be at their service. This is something I do in my spare time.” He said there were a lot of unrecognised talented artists in his area and he wanted to give them a chance as he was well connected. “I have featured them on my album. I help my community a lot, be it paying for funerals, buying food for the less fortunate or helping with anything I can,” he said. G Millionaire said he wished people could stop judging his musical gift because in the end it would benefit a lot of people, not just him. “Being a pastor does not mean I can’t lead a normal life and follow my dreams. I’ll forever respect the church and heal the sick, but I also have other commitments to fulfil. ”My congregants should sit back, relax and enjoy my album. “Their support would be appreciated,” he said.
