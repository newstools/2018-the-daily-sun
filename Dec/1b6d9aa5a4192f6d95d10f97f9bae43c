ORATILE Khukhwana (18), who fell to her death during a music festival in North West last weekend, was buried on Saturday. Oratile was among a crowd that ran to the stands at the Mmabatho Stadium to find shelter from rain during the Mahika Mahikeng Maftown Heights Music Festival. It’s not known if she fell or was pushed and police are investigating. Her funeral service was held at the St Henry’s Catholic Church, in Montshioa outside Mahikeng, and she was buried at the Matlalong Cemetery. Her teachers at Lapologang High School, where she was in matric, described her as a hard-working pupil who always produced good marks. The teachers said they had no doubt she passed her matric exams. Her friend Keletso Maoto described Oratile as a motivator, a role model and a friend. Oratile is said to have been an obedient girl who never attended music festivals. Her uncle Dintwa Khukhwana said they heard on social media that a girl had died during the festival but never thought it could be her. Dintwa said he didn’t want to point fingers but pleaded with the event organisers to ensure safety. Her other uncle, Phillip, said they had expected so much from the young girl. “She was already a shining star in the family,” he said. Her teammate at the Setsokotsane Netball Club, Neo Botlhoko, said: “She was a promising netball player. “We’ve lost a very promising young star.” The North West Department of Culture, Arts and Traditional Affairs paid for the funeral.
