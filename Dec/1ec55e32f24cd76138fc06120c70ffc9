BRIAN Dames has quit the Eskom sustainability task team, only days after the team’s appointment. Dames, CEO of African Rainbow Energy and Power, told President Cyril Ramaphosa that while he was prepared to serve the country, he was unable to serve on the task team. Ramaphosa has agreed to let Dames go. Dames said he had noted concerns raised about a “perceived conflict of interest” relating to the scope of work and terms of reference of the task team. According to presidential spokeswoman Khusela Diko, Ramaphosa had expressed his appreciation for Dames’ willingness to serve and respected the judgement he exercised. Ramaphosa appointed the task team last week to advise government on actions to resolve Eskom’s operational, structural and financial challenges. The team is made up of eight members. They are Anton Eberhard, Tsakani Mthombeni, Sy Gourrah, Grove Steyn, Frans Baleni, Mick Davis and Busisiwe Vilakazi. The team will also work with different parties in the labour and business sectors, as well as Eskom’s board of directors and management and the department of public enterprises. Ramaphosa asked the task team to submit its initial recommendations by the end of next month.
