COPS from 11 police stations, pastors and residents came together to remember Nhlanhla Mabena. “We pray for the end of violence against women and children,” said Pastor Zodwa Khoza at Nhlanhla’s home in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni on Friday. Nhlanhla (10) died a terrible death in September. She went missing after her mum sent her to buy headache powder. Her body was found dumped near her home a day after she had been kidnapped. Her mutilated legs were later found decomposed. Pastors prayed against the evil spirits in the area. The cops are still looking for Nhlanhla’s killers after local sangoma Belina Mhlongo was falsely accused by a mob. The sangoma’s two cars and a house were burned on the day that one of Nhlanhla’s legs was found in an open veld in Etwatwa. Three people were shot dead after they shot at cops who were trying to save the sangoma’s house. The sangoma and her family spent days in the local police station as they had no place to stay. The sangoma said she was heartbroken after being treated badly by residents. “People spread false rumours and they destroyed my family. “I have never used body parts because my ancestors are against it,” she said. “God will punish all those who have dragged my name through the mud.” Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said the cops were still looking for the suspects.
