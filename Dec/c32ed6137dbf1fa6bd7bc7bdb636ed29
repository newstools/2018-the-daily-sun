more than 100 illegal gambling machines have been destroyed. The Limpopo Gambling Board had recently confiscated the machines from local shops and destroyed them at the weekend. Chairman of the board Elijah Tjiane said: “The serious crimes we’re witnessing in the country start with illegal machines operating in local shops. They then go to drugs and later graduate to other heavy crimes.” Tjiane said the R500 fine illegal gambling operaters got was too little. “We wish lawmakers could come up with a fine that will fit the crime the person has committed.” Limpopo Economic Development MEC Seaparo Sekoati said illegal gambling was crippling businesses which operated by the book. He said destroying the illegal machines would assist in reducing crime in the province. “The work done by the board’s law enforcement unit, working closely with police in tackling illegal and harmful economic activities, is outstanding. Our law enforcement officers confiscated 101 gambling machines which were collected from various spaza shops in and around our communities. “Illegal gambling outlets have a negative impact on our economy. “Such unregistered and underground operations do not adhere to the tax legislation of the country,” said Sekoati.
