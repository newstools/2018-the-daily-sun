Model and media personality, Refilwe Modiselle has been in the spotlight for a number of years now and with that comes a whole lot of scrutiny. But unlike other personalities, who are attacked for their work, relationships and money (or lack thereof), Refilwe has often gotten the raw end of the stick. The gorgeous model says she has had to endure being called ugly by people from all over the world. The star made the revelation this week on social media, reminding people of how vile the internet can be. But on the brighter side, it seems as though Refilwe has transcended the vile words that have been spewed in her direction and in fact, she has used them to become the fullest expression of herself. ICYMI: REFILWE SHOWS LOVE TO TREVOR NOAH! “I don't know how many times I have had people call me ugly man from all over the world yaz & you know what the older I've grown the more I've had to learn to be immune to it cause beauty is relative at the end of the day. So-called ugly is the reason I'm the light I am today,” she said. This isn’t the only gem to found on Refilwe’s timeline however, she has been preaching some pretty important messages for a while now. Refilwe, who is one of the famous Modiselle sisters, is on a path to inspire, encourage and uplift anyone who comes into her space so her TL literally looks like a self-help book and we are here for all it. Big ups to her!
