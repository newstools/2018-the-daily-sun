DOZENS of popular porn sites were this
week blocked from reaching consumers in Uganda. According to Daily Monitor, the move
comes after service providers were ordered to do so by the Uganda Communications Commission. Three of the sites - Pornhub.com,
Xvideos.com and Youporn.com - were among the top 100 most visited websites in
Uganda before the ban took effect. The sites have been providing pornographic
material for free. Some of the porn sites carried leaked
nude videos of Ugandan celebs and others advertised the services of magoshas. Chairwoman of the Pornography Control
Committee, Annette Kezaabu said: “As I speak, we have a team that is compiling
a list of other porn sites that will be blocked. We anticipate that some people
will open up new sites but this is a continuous process.” Uganda’s anti-porn law was passed in
2014 and the government has been struggling to crackdown on porn sites since. Their
recent success was made possible by the government buying porn detection
technology. The law bans people from producing or
publishing porn, threatening a Shs10 million (about R38 400) fine or 10 years
in jail if found guilty. The Ugandan government has recently
taken tough measures to restrict its citizens’ internet freedom. Taxes were
introduced this year on mobile money transactions and the use of social media. The percentage of Ugandans still using
social media platforms has dropped from 96% to 85%, according to TechNadu.
