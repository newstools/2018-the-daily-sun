Lyle Foster continued his impressive form as Amajita advanced to the final of the COSAFA U20 Championships after defeating Angola on Tuesday. Amajita advanced to the last four stage after thumping Swaziland 4-0 in their final group B clash on Saturday. Foster, who is set to join Ligue One giants Monaco in January, also bagged a brace in the defending champions 5-0 rout of Mauritius and netted in the 4-0 victory over Swaziland. Against Angola the South Africans dominated the opening exchanges, but they were unable to carve out a clear-cut chance in the opening 20 minutes. Foster went close to breaking the deadlock after 25 minutes after being picked out by Promise Mkhuma but his effort sailed over the bar. The Amajita striker was not to be denied a minute later when he fired home following through ball from Nkosingiphile Ngcobo.
