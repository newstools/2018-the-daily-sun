While tuk-tuks have become a familiar sight on the roads of Johannesburg suburbs such as Sandton and Melville, it is still unusual for the three-wheeled taxis' drivers to be women. Prossy Namujju is breaking that stereotype. Namujju, 37, moved to South Africa from Uganda in 2016. Before she relocated to the country, she worked as a vendor in one of Uganda's markets until her stall was burned down. Namujju said the incident forced her to learn how to drive a tuk-tuk and take it up as her daily job to provide for her four children. She then decided to move to South Africa with the hope that there would be better opportunities. After struggling to get employment, she was helped by friends and became a tuk-tuk driver based in Melville. Long working days Popularly known as "Mama Tuk-Tuk", Namujju operates around Braamfontein, Fordsburg, Greenside, Westdene and other nearby suburbs such as Sandton, Rosebank and Soweto at fees ranging from R20 to R150.       "One day I got a call from my client who works at Absa, she said she trusts me and I should transport her to Cresta. As I was about to drop my customer one taxi driver came and pushed my tuk-tuk down," said Namujju. 'Strong, bold and hard-working' She said incidents such as this did not deter her, and she remained motivated because she loves her job. "People of South Africa call me Mama Tuk-Tuk, they say they love Mama Tuk-Tuk and so that's my name," she said. Several of Namujju's colleagues describe her as "strong, bold and hard-working". Jajah Baker, a fellow tuk-tuk driver, said Namujju actually has more clients than the male drivers, as clients trust her. "She has not yet faced any problems. Some customers sympathise with her because she is a lady. Actually, she has got many customers, more than us men. When people come they say 'let me take the lady' because they see that she is the only lady around," Baker said.
