Popular South African TV presenter, Luyanda Potwana has taken some time, as we draw near the end of the year, to reflect on some of his favourite travels. The 37-year-old Nyan'Nyan host took to Instagram to share some pictures of his travels all over the world from Lagos to New York. He shared pictures of himself in Hollywood, Las Vegas, and California. He followed those up with more pictures of his travels to Washington, New York and Maryland. He rounded out the thread with images of himself visiting Istanbul in Turkey, London in the United Kingdom, Frankfurt in Germany, Lagos in Nigeria, and California in the US. Check out the pictures below and more on his Instagram feed. This time 2016 — I was having a time of my life in HOLLYWOOD, California - USA ???? A post shared by  SHAKURR ??
