JOE Gqabi district is one of the areas that has been hit by drought over the past few years. But government is trying by all means to save farmers’ livestock from the disaster. On Tuesday, Rural Development and Agrarian Reform MEC Xolile Nqatha officially launched a feedlot of about R2,7 million in Aliwal North, under the Walter Sisulu Municipality. The area has a capacity to accommodate 300 cattle at a time, and it is one of the 12 feedlots currently operational in the province. The department has partnered with the National Agricultural Marketing Council and local municipalities to improve the quality of livestock. Through the feedlots, communal farmers increase the income they earn from cattle production. They are also able to take their livestock to the funded feedlots for fattening over a period of 120 days. This is done at a standard fee of between R850 and R900. Once the cattle are ready for commercial markets, they are sold to abattoirs or private buyers. This year the department has invested R16,5 million to increase the number of feedlots across the province. The department currently supports 11 rural custom feedlots that target communal farmers. It also supports one commercial feedlot. The feedlots are in the Chris Hani district, Amathole and the OR Tambo district. MEC Nqatha said government was committed to ensuring that emerging farmers were developed to become fully fledged commercial farmers. “By constructing the feedlot, we want to change the economic landscape of Aliwal North. We want farmers to form a movement to fight against poverty and inequality, and ensure economic transformation too,” he said.
