UP-AND-COMING rapper Odwa Situma is proud of her kasi. The 20-year-old, better known as Dee Koala, often raps about Khayelitsha in Cape Town. Her new single, Whuzet, is making waves around the country. She told SunBuzz her love of hip hop started two years ago. Dee said she took a chance in the rap game and it paid off. “I decided to give rap a try, but little did I know it would take me this far.” “Ever since I started rapping, I’ve worked with local artists such as 9 Ether, Flvck and Khalifornication.” Her EP, 18-18, was released two years ago. She said she was proud of her achievements so far. “I haven’t had any challenges, despite the fact that some people still think I’m 16. “But I like being underestimated because it motivates me to work hard,” she said. Dee said she sometimes raps in Xhosa. “I believe my flow in Xhosa is what sets me apart from other artists,” she said. Dee has performed at events such as Major League Gardens with Riky Rick, Absolut One Source Live and Capsule Festival. She said the highlight of her career was when she performed with famous singer Sho Madjozi on Absolut One Source Live.
