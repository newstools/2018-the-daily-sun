SA UNDER-20 national men’s team coach, Thabo Senong, has every reason to be happy with the performances his boys have shown in the Cosafa Youth Championships currently being staged in Kitwe, Zambia. Amajita, who are the defending champions, have booked their place in the semi-finals of the competition, scoring nine goals and conceding none in the process. They made light work of both their opponents in their three team group after Namibia’s late withdrawal from the tournament. Senong’s charges spanked Mauritius 5-0 in their opening game before thrashing neighbours eSwatini 4-0 in their second and final group game. Star players Lyle Foster, Luke Le Roux, Promise Mkhuma and Thabiso Monyane have all put in some solid performances with Amajita looking in impressive form. Their attention now turns to Angola in the semi-final tomorrow at Nkana Stadium (1pm) as they set their sights on the final which is now set to take place a day earlier than initially planned. Senong is using the regional youth tournament to prepare for the bigger test of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) set to take place in Niger next year in February. Amajita will have to reach the Afcon semi-finals to book their ticket to Poland for the FIFA under-20 World Cup next year, which is their ultimate goal. Senong can be confident as his boys have shown good signs in Zambia to suggest that they are well on track with their preparations to achieve their target.
