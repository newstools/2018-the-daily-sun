Controversial poet and activist Ntsiki Mazwai is never shy to speak her mind. The star has made her feelings about the Global Citizen Festival clear, saying “it was a spit in the faces of the poor.” Following the conclusion of the festival, concert goers were mugged at a petrol station outside the FNB Stadium. Thugs who had targeted the festival, had a feast as they attacked and robbed many helpless fans off their possessions. Ntsiki took to social media to share her controversial thoughts on the incident. “The concept of this concert was evil, ugly and excluded most people. You deserved to get robbed for spitting in the faces of the poor. Then u put the show near the poor- aninyi perhaps?” she shared. The comments sparked outrage as the poet was slammed and accused of being “insensitive.” In a video shared on social media on Tuesday, Ntsiki explained her comments, saying: “I did not say that the festival goers deserved to be robbed, what I said was ‘how dare you put a high class, middle class elitist event in the neighbourhood of the poor and expect nothing to happen.’ That is spitting on the faces of the poor and anyone who spits on the faces of the poor does deserve that, in Africa we don’t do that, we don’t spit on the faces of the poor.” She went on to add that If the festival was meant to benefit the poor, they would have been included. “You did not include the community, vendors were not even allowed to sell their stuff so I don’t know what kind of community event this was that excluded the community. How do you plan to eradicate the poverty when you are contributing to it? The festival put a lot of people in danger and it should be made to account,” she added.
