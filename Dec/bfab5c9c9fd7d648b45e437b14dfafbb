MALIBONGWE Mdwaba from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, has started an organisation to help new actors. “I saw the need to bridge the gap between those who’ve been in the industry for some time and those who’ve just started,” said the 20-year-old actor. Indibano – The Encounter facilitates discussion among actors. “The organisation also shows them how to conduct themselves and how things are handled in the industry,” he said. After getting his first gig as an extra in 2014, Malibongwe has never looked back. “While growing up, I wanted to be a pilot,” he said. “But acting called louder and I love it.” He has appeared in Ubudoda, Romeo and Romeo, and in Isithembiso as Lungisani Ncapayi. “Now I’m on MTV Shuga and am studying at the same time”. He said it was important for young actors to study. “Education gives you more options,” he said. He studied theatre performance and arts management at Wits University. He also studied sign language to have something to fall back on. “Sometimes things get really tough in this industry, and that’s why it’s important to study to explore backup options,” said Malibongwe.
