THE FAMILY of 13 were excited last month after an RDP house was built for them – but now they are homeless! Gogo Mateboho Mohotsi’s family member allegedly sold their home to go to initiation school on Saturday! The 68-year-old from Monyakeng, Wesselsbron, and her family are now living under a tree. “We have nowhere to go. I thought it was a joke when a man told me to move my furniture. “My dead husband registered for an RDP before he died 10 years ago. Last month my dreams finally came true when we were given the keys to the house.” She said her grandson always wanted to go to initiation school. “He sold the house for R18 000 and disappeared. On Saturday sheriffs told me to pack my belongings and go. Cops said there was nothing they could do as it no longer was in my name,” she said. Neighbour Sabata Tau (38) said: “We tried speaking to municipal officials but were not successful. I think there is corruption at our municipality.” Human settlements spokeswoman Senna Bogatsu said investigations found that neither the gogo nor her dead husband appeared on their system as house applicants. “We found the house appears in the name of their relative they claim bought it illegally. The department does not encourage beneficiaries to sell their houses. “We advise the family to apply for a site at their municipality and after receiving one, can apply for an RDP. Mateboho can go to the local office and ask to be registered on the national housing needs register,” Bogatsu said. Gogo said she used to live with the land owner, an elderly woman who has since died. “I was told by the owner of the land to occupy it before she died. After the RDP was built, I moved in with my family, thinking it would be changed into my name.”
