THERE are more than 100 shacks in the school yard. And nearby residents are calling it an estate. This is because the shack dwellers at Bakgomana Primary School in Diepkloof, Soweto, live like people in the gated suburbs. Their gate is locked and no strangers are allowed if they do not know who they are visiting. There is a security guard at the gate to prevent thugs from coming in to steal their cars. Last year residents took over the abandoned school, turning classrooms into their homes. But because there were many, others built shacks on the school grounds. The school once had overgrown grass and it attracted thugs and nyaope addicts. Daily Sun published the story in February of residents who hired equipment to remove grass at the school. Soon after that, cops came to remove the squatters, but they refused to go. They said it was better to live at the school instead of it being turned into a hiding place for thugs. One of the community leaders, Thami Dlamini, said: “We want to keep this place clean to show those who are against us that we deserve to be here.” Thami said cops have stopped harassing them because the case of eviction against them was pending. One of the residents at the school, Mary Molewa, said: “Young boys used to smoke nyaope here. We also found condoms and purses. “The school was vandalised, but we are turning it into something better. Gauteng Infrastructure Development MEC Jacob Mamabolo said they had plans for abandoned schools. “We are not going to allow people to occupy them as it is against the law.”
