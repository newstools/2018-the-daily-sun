A video clip of Law Enforcement officers getting down has gone viral. In the video,  the two cops in uniform, a female and male, are seen taking turns to dance to Distruction Boyz' hit song,  Omunye Phezu Komunye. The two cops entertained the crowd at a Social Crime Prevention Initiative where kids and the elderly received Christmas presents. While others were angry at the dancing cops others saw nothing wrong with it. They said the officers are human too and were not breaking the law. "Instead, they are embracing their jobs and having fun. How many people actually show passion and enthusiasm with their daily jobs? "There's honestly so much more other things to concern yourself with," said social media user Manogary Nogs Moonsammy. Kerry Leigh de Jager said: "Could not agree more. The stress that police officers go through on a daily basis is enough for the bravest of souls to loose it. The fact that they are celebrating should be a testament to the strength they have." Umzukulu Ka Sitsha said: "They are not breaking any LAW , let them have fun. They are human too."
