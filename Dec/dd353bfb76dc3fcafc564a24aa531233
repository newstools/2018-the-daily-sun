THE ANC Youth League in Mpumalanga has urged national leadership to correct alleged abnormalities. This after representatives, allegedly older than the youth age maximum, were voted in at the list conference held at Mbombela Stadium this month. The people are expected to represent the youth at the Legislature and National Assembly after next year’s general election. Mpumalanga Youth League spokesman Bheki Sithole said only one person was qualified to represent the league. “Young, competent and capable leaders were removed from the consolidated list and replaced by older people.” Sithole said they were aware of people in the PEC who tampered with the list, in direct violation of branch nominations. “This not only undermines the youth but branches of the ANC as well,” said Sithole. “We want to put it clearly that only the youth can represent the league.” He also warned the dominant faction in the PEC to allow corrective measures to be taken. )   Meanwhile, Sasekani Manzini, provincial ANC spokeswoman, said they haven’t received any complaints regarding the matter.
