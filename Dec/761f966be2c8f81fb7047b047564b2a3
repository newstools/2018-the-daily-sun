MADALA Joel Mkhosana (70) has sleepless nights whenever he thinks about his mum’s family. Joel, from Makause squatter camp in Germiston, Ekurhuleni, is looking for his maternal family. The madala was raised by his father France Mkhosana and his stepmum Paulina in Sterkspruit, Eastern Cape. His father died in 1992. Some people told him his mum was coloured. “I only found out Paulina was my stepmum when I was 26. “My childhood was very difficult. “I was abused and people could tell I was not her biological son,” he said. “I feel like I do not have a family. “I need to find my mum’s relatives,” he said. Joel told Daily Sun he feared he would die without meeting his mum’s side of the family. “I want to die in peace. I don’t want to be buried like a dog without my family,” he said. The madala pleaded with SunReaders who have any information about his mum’s family to come forward.
