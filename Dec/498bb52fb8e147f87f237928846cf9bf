A FREE State hospital has cleared its name after a young mum accused it of stealing her newborn. An investigation and DNA tests by Pelonomi Hospital proved that Ntebaleng Finger’s premature baby boy had died and she was informed by staff of the death. Daily Sun ran stories about Ntebaleng on 19 and 22 October, in which she claimed a doctor at the hospital took her baby for a bath and later told her the baby had died and been cremated. Free State health spokesman Mondli Mvambi said: “DNA tests show that the child was 99,89% Ntebaleng’s. The total cost incurred on this case is R24 421. Our reports tracking the full story and experience of Ntebaleng Fingerindicate that she knew the child was dead as a result of being born extremely premature. The baby’s lungs were extremely underdeveloped and he could not breathe. “These kinds of babies often suffer from internal bleeding in the lungs. Resuscitation was attempted but did not yield positive results. “The baby was certified dead and the mother was duly informed. “The outcome of the DNA tests were explained to the mother and relatives.” Ntebaleng alleged that a doctor allegedly told her not to breast-feed the baby. The same doctor allegedly later took the baby to be bathed. Ntebaleng told daily Sun she never saw her baby again andwas later told the child had died. Ntebaleng’s sister Keheletswe Madikgetla (33) said the body was released last week and buried, although they had thought Ntebaleng’s baby was not dead. Ntebaleng could not hold back her tears as she said goodbye during the funeral at South Park Cemetery in Bloemfontein. Keheletswe said they named the child Sipho with the belief that God will be on their side and the truth will come out.
