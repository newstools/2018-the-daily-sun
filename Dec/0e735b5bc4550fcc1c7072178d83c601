RESIDENTS of Gugulethu in Cape Town met at the sports complex to talk about their challenges. The imbizo was organised by the Gugulethu Development Forum. Chairman Lee Khabele said: “The high level of rape, kidnapping and other types of crime are reasons why the forum organised the imbizo and invited different stakeholders.” Nomlindelo Mgugwana (53) believes that as long as there are people selling drugs, they will never win the battle. “People who commit crime first use drugs before doing it. So the main cause is drug use. We have to deal with that first.” The residents were also concerned about the high rate of crime at Gugulethu Mall and Nyanga Junction. Captain Makwedini Mdzula from Gugulethu cop shop said they had a youth desk that dealt with youth problems. “If you know anyone who needs help, they will find it at our station,” Mdzula told the People’s Paper. He urged the community to patrol their area and work with cops.
