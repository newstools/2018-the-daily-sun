CHRISTMAS is for sharing festive cheer in Mzansi. But for this family, it will be a time of sombre reflection. The Menyukos from Ga-Rankuwa zone 2 don’t look forward to the day. This year their father will be absent. Windsor Menyuko (50) said his Morris (69) went missing earlier this month. He said his dad, who had dementia, walked out and never came back. “He went missing again two weeks ago, and we found him in Kgabalatsane in the North West. “The same thing happened last year. “He went missing just before Christmas, but we found him afterwards.” But this year they have had no success. “We’ve searched everywhere. We even went to hospitals and local mortuaries, but all our efforts were in vain.” He said they had tried to get him in an old age home. “We believe he would be taken care of at the home, but we’ve been having problems getting a reference letter. “We don’t know where he is, what he’s eating, or where he’s sleeping.” Windsor appealed to anyone who might know his father’s whereabouts to call the Daily Sun Tshwane office on 012 485 9251 or their nearest cop shop. Ga-Rankuwa police spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi confirmed that Morris was reported missing. He said police were still investigating and helping the family find their missing father.
