Three people were shot and injured on Tuesday when two men jumped out of a car and opened fire at a busy taxi rank in Waterloo, Durban. “I was loading groceries onto the taxi when I suddenly heard gunshots and fell to the ground to avoid the flying bullets,” said the woman. According to security company Reaction Unit of South Africa, three people were injured. Spokesman Prem Balram said: “Two people sustained gunshot wounds to the leg and a third one was shot in the stomach.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “Cases of attempted murder are being investigated.” Santaco spokesman Boy Zondi said: “We always urge taxi association to sit down and sort their differences. “In this case I don’t know what the motive for the incident was. “Maybe we will know whether it was a taxi-related issue after the investigation.” .
