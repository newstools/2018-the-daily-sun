AFTER Stefaan Ntimane (54) was diagnosed with HIV 23 years ago, it was his positive attitude that got him this far. Stefaan from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni, who’s married with five kids, was diagnosed at the age of 31. “I told the nurse I can’t be HIV positive because I only dated beautiful women,” he said. But when he started losing a weight and getting tired easily, he knew the diagnosis was true. “My family thought I was going to die,” he said. “And my best friend made it clear he didn’t want anything to do with people living with the virus. “The people I knew to be living with the virus were dying like flies. I realised I needed to change my lifestyle. I didn’t want to die.” Acceptance played an important role in his survival. He took vitamins and vegetables because ARVs were not available at the time. He also gave educational talks. “People always complain about the horrible treatment they get from public healthcare facilities. “I never experienced that because I’ve always maintained a positive mindset. “People living with HIV/Aids need to accept that visiting a doctor is part of their life. “They need to accept that they’ll queue for hours when visiting a public healthcare facility.”
