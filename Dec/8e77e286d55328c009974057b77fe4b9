LOWER Crossroads residents in Philippi East, Cape Town want a police van next to Mandalay Bridge 24/7, so they can be safe from criminals who are robbing them. Nokwandisa Ndandani, a 45-year-old woman, told Daily Sun they are the victims of criminals who are targeting residents who use Mandalay Bridge. “When we are going to Mandalay we use that bridge and some residents in Mandalay use it to come this side, but we are being robbed by criminals,” said Ndandani. Mxolisi Zintonga a 34-year-old, said these criminals did not wait for darkness to rob people, but they did so at midday. “People are losing their valuable things on that bridge and it is difficult for us to get involved because we do not want to get shot by these criminals,” added Zintonga. Residents want Philippi cop shop to send officers there to stay the whole day, so they can be safe. “During this time of the year they become worse because they know that no one will stop them when they are robbing,” said Zintonga. Andisiwe Susani, a 30-year-old, said the criminals not only took cellphones, but also threw victims into a canal next to the bridge. “If they did not get anything from you, they ask why did you leave your belongings at home and then start pushing you into the canal,”said Susani. Captain Bheki Xulu, spokesman for Philippi East police, said statistics did not indicate the problem. “Our people tend not to report the robberies taking place on that bridge,” said Xulu.
