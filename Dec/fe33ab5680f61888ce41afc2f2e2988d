DOVES were released as brave Ontlametse Phalatse was remembered at a celebration of her life on Friday. Former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo, Madibeng mayor Jostina Mothibe and gospel singer Winnie Mashaba attended the event at Ontlametse’s home in Hebron in the North West. Hebron Primary School was supposed to be renamed Ontlametse Phalatse Primary School, but non-payment to a service provider prevented the renaming. Keabetswe Mokoena interdicted the event after not being paid for 18 months by the education department. Ontlametse was the first black person to be diagnosed with progeria, which creates rapid aging. Doctors predicted she would not live beyond 14, but she lived until she was 18, passed matric, and met former president Jacob Zuma on her birthday. Mahumapelo called on the department to make sure a book was written about Ontlametse’s life. “She became a tree that produced trees of education,” he said. Mothibe said she was humbled by Ontlametse’s confidence. “Ontlametse was never ashamed of who she was,” said Mothibe. Winnie sang for the guests. Despite interdicting the renaming of the school, Keabetswe attended the event. She told Daily Sun the department was dragging Ontlametse’s name through the mud. She said she had an agreement with the department to tell Ontlametse’s story to special needs schools across the province. “They have been ignoring me for 18 months. I had no choice but to interdict the event,” she said. North West education spokesman Freddy Sepeng was surprised to hear the event took place as it had been postponed to next year. He refused to comment on whether the department owed Keabetswe.
