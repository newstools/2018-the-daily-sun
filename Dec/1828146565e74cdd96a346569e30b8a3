MINISTER of Women in the Presidency Bathabile Dlamini says women should be seen as companions, not competitors. Dlamini was speaking during a dialogue session with men and boys in Tshwane on Sunday. “The dialogue is aimed at encouraging men and boys to become part of the solution in ending the scourge of gender-based violence,” said Dlamini. She said the dialogue was one of several activities the Department of Women was holding across Mzansi during 16 Days of Activism For No Violence Against Women and Children, to raise awareness of gender-based violence. “In the past three days the department has engaged community members in Ngcobo, Queenstown and Fort Beaufort in Eastern Cape,” she said. Dlamini said the department visited shopping centres, taxi ranks, schools and churches and raised issues of how to identify healthy and unhealthy relationships. She said in honouring the centenary year of the life and legacy of Albertina Sisulu, her department hosted a memorial lecture presented by Mama Albertina’s granddaughter, Ntsiki Sisulu, in Queenstown on Friday. Dlamini called on South Africa to portray positive images of manhood. Tshepo Mafatshe (12) said: “We only see images of abused women, but we still do not know what it means to be a good man.” Dlamini said Tshepo’s comment pointed to a lack of positive role models in society. “Government alone cannot provide this. This must come from wcommunities,” she said. She said the dialogue served to engage men and boys on strategies to combat violence and socialise boys and girls into a society free of gender-based violence (GBV). She said Mzansi heeded President Cyril Ramaphosa’s call during the recent GBV summit to ensure the campaign became a daily one.
