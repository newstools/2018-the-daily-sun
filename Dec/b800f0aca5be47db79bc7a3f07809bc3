LOAD shedding has been lifted – for now, at least. People around the country can enjoy the December holidays without worrying about it. Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe said load shedding could be back by mid-January. He said the utility may need to reinstate rolling power cuts after factories and businesses reopened. In the intesrview on national radio, he said the power utility was making progress in reducing planned outages. “From now until 15 January, the probability of load shedding will be very minimal,” he said. “As we work on the maintenance we hope the situation will get better, but there may be stage one load shedding in the new year.” Eskom announced stage one load shedding when it planned to cut up to 1 000 megawatts from the power grid. President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed an eight-person team on 14 December to advise the government on resolving Eskom’s challenges.
