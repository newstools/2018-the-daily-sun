FORMER Rhythm City actress and musician dancer, Ntando Duma, was looking forward to entertaining fans this festive season. The star was going host The Plug tomorrow in Johannesburg, but sadly she had to cancel the show due to “security concerns” – a letter she posted on her Instagram account claims. The mother of one said fans should however hold on to their ti8ckets, as the event would take place sometime next year. She wrote: “It is with regret to announce that The Plug event has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. My team and I would like to give Pluggers an experience that is of great quality, safety and fun with no compromising. To those who have already purchased tickets, please keep them safe as they will be valid next year when the new date is set and for those that want refund they can, with pleasure go claim at Computicket. My humble apologies for any inconveniences caused & may you all have a safe weekend ???? ? Thank you all for the support you have shown me, my dream is still set to come to life. Ngiyabonga KUTHI!??
