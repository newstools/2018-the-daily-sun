KZN TEACHER unions have lashed out at the education department for not providing emergency services at marking centres. Marker Philani Gumede died on Tuesday night at Pietermaritzburg Girls High, a marking centre for this year’s matric exams. Gumede, a teacher at Ibiva High School in Jozini, collapsed at the centre and died on Tuesday night. The department had employed him as an exam marker. Colleagues said he was not well and they called the ambulance, but before it could arrive he asked for his medication. “We believe it was in the locker or in his room, but he collapsed and died while waiting for the ambulance,” they said. “We did not know what type of chronic disease he suffered from and are still waiting to hear from his family.” The SA Democratic Teachers’ Union and National Teachers’ Union blamed the department for not providing emergency service vehicles to be on standby to deal with disasters at marking centres. The unions called on the department to provide these vehicles for the centres. They said if there had been an ambulance at the centre, Gumede could have been saved. Sadtu provincial secretary Nomarashiya Caluza told Daily Sun yesterday the department should provide at least one ambulance at the centre in case there is any emergency during marking. National Teachers’ Union president Allen Thompson echoed her words. “I agree with my colleague Caluza. We need at least one ambulance at the centre so people can get help immediately,” Thompson said. Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said their calls were unnecessary, because Gumede could have died at school or anywhere else. “I do not understand why the unions are saying this. “I have not seen an ambulance at any work place or business where there is parking outside, waiting to rush ill workers to hospital. What they are calling for to be done is practically impossible,” Mahlambi said.
