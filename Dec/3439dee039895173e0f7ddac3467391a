THERE is no need for residents living around Lakeside in Benoni, Ekurhuleni, to panic. This is according to human settlements MMC Lesiba Mpya. He told Daily Sun on Wednesday that although the situation might look disastrous, everything was under control. A few days ago a hole was discovered on the Middleway Dam spillway and it looked like a disaster waiting to happen. Mpya said his department attended to the problem after they were made aware of it. He said they would have to fix the entire spillway, which might take three to six months. “This structure is about 60 years old and it undergoes maintenance from time to time. “With the aging infrastructure, it is difficult to maintain its integrity. “It has caved in and that puts the entire structure at risk,” he said. He said if the spillway experienced more damage, the whole lake would overflow and endanger the hospital, mall and residential areas around it. Mpya said motorists who use Tom Jones Street to and from the N12 highway would also be in danger. Yesterday residents in the area had to use alternative routes as some of the roads were closed due to a huge pipe passing through them. The pipe was used to drain water from the spillway. Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina said the roads would be opened by Saturday. He said the municipality would install six syphons to pump out water from the dam. “Our engineers are going to work tirelessly to fix the part that has been damaged. “They are going to be using radars to check other areas that could be damaged,” he said Municipal engineers removed plants from the stream to ensure the water drained from the lake flowed easily. Pumps are being used to drain water from the lake and to keep the dam levels down so engineers can investigate the cause of the damage.
