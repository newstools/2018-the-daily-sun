ALL Lucky Moalusi (35) wanted to do was to get an affidavit certified at the cop shop. But he got the shock of his life when he saw his car speeding out of the Orlando Police Station parking lot in Soweto on Saturday. “I was with my grandmother. I parked the car in the police station’s parking area and went in to certify my affidavit, leaving my grandmother in the car,” he said. But he knew something was wrong when he saw his disabled 65-year-old grandmother coming into the station. “She told me someone came to the car and told her I was looking for her,” he said. “I knew there was trouble. I ran to the parking lot but I was too late!” Lucky watched helplessly as his car raced out of the gate. He said he ran into the charge office to try to get the police to quickly run after his Fiat Punto. “I asked them to chase after my car but they refused. “I only got to open a case 30 minutes later.” Lucky said he asked around the station and found out that the man who stole his car was with a woman and a young child. “My grandmother is old. She was in a panic and she came rushing into the station. This tsotsi got my car with the keys. My phones and other belongings were also in the car.” Lucky said if the cops reacted quickly, they would have managed to get his car back. Police spokeswoman Constable Mpho Hangwani of Orlando Police Station said they were investigating a case of a stolen vehicle. “I can’t comment on any other information,” Hangwani said.
