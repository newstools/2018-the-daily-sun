One dress, two fabulous ladies; we certainly do love a good who wore it best moment. In this case, the stakes are between media powerhouse, Nomzamo Mbatha and fashion star and stylist to the elite, Kefilwe Mabote. Both stars have been spotted wearing the stunning Red Zulu Dress from Oscar & Rose’s Ekhaya collection which debuted earlier this year. Oscar & Rose is a South African commercial fashion brand that is based in Johannesburg and was founded by Noor Thandiwe Modise. Their beautiful Ekhaya Collection is brand’s first full body of work. PICS: NOMZAMO DEBUTE STUNNING NEW PIXIE CUT Kefilwe wore it first in November to a fancy luncheon at the fabulous Epicure Restaurant in Joburg north, her favourite restaurant. Nomzamo then rocked the frock today at a Fox Africa brunch at the fabulous and exclusive Steyn City in Joburg alongside Taraji P. Henson. Both ladies rocked the orange dress with short hair, serving style star realness. Nomzamo chose a classic, Twiggy (real name Lesley Lawson) inspired pixie cut and her radiance just gave us chills. Kefilwe, on the other hand, chose her regular yet flawless short bob that frames her face perfectly just falls down her face like liquid gold. So, who wore it best? Watch where you place your energy. ?? A post shared by  Nomzamo Mbatha ???? (@nomzamo_m) on Dec 11, 2018 at 4:06am PST  ?? @oscarandrose A post shared by  Kefilwe Mabote ????
