MORUTI Lebona makes and sells dog kennels and wooden toilets for a living. The 48-year-old from Phase 9 kasi in Bloemfontein started selling fruit on the streets in 2009. Business was slow and he then decided to work with wood. Moruti told Daily Sun he collects pallets at shops and dumping sites. He then cuts the wood to make beautiful toilets and kennels. “I started the business in 2010 and I have never looked back. “The money I make helps me feed my family,” Moruti said. He told the People’s Paper he made two or three kennels a day. “I charge R150 for a small kennel and R400 for a big one. “The toilets cost R500,” said Moruti. “Business is good, especially at the end of the month. ” He said customer service was very important to him. “I always make sure my customers are satisfied and happy with my work. “Many people in the kasi do not have toilets. “They need the wooden toilets while waiting for the municipality to build them proper toilets,” Moruti told Daily Sun. “I was never trained for this job. This is a God-given talent and I am proud of myself.”
