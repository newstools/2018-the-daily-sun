THE VBS saga and lack of service delivery are claiming North West mayors left, right and centre. In total, six mayors in the province have been fired. This after the ANC provincial task team on Tuesday gave the mayors their marching orders. The number earlier had been seven, when mayor of Matlosana Municipality Maetu Kgaile was removed by a vote supported by 17 ANC councillors three weeks ago. But officials from Luthuli House, led by Jessie Duarte, came and ordered their councillors to vote her back in, which they did. The ANC, however, apologised to the people of Matlosana and promised to fix service delivery there. Noni Kgabi, mayor of Maquassie Municipality, was not so lucky after people of Wolmaranstad took to the streets and accused her of abusing her official vehicle, not meeting the community and allowing service delivery in the area to suffer. The premier’s office sent officials to listen to the people’s demands. Now the mayor is gone. ANC spokesman in the province, Kabelo Mataboge, said the party also resolved to recall Bitsa Lenkopane as mayor of Kagisano-Molopo. “The new mayoral candidate is Segomotso Mere.” Mataboge said the provincial task team had resolved to recall both the mayors of Maquassie and Mamusa in the interest of improving efficient service delivery and restoring public confidence in the ANC. Following the release of the report on VBS, the task team also resolved that the affected mayors in Madibeng, Moretele, Mahikeng and Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati be recalled “with immediate effect”, Mataboge said. He said the task team called for criminal charges to be brought against those who were involved in the VBS scam. The task team is also looking at Premier Job Mokgoro to use his powers to reshuffle the MECs.
