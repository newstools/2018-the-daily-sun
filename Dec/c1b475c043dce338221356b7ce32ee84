ONLY three traditional surgeons have been arrested for illegal circumcisions following the death of 19 initiates this summer. Buffalo City Metro reported its fourth death after Hlumelo Sitsili (16) from Mdantsane died on Tuesday. The 18th initiate who died was Siyabonga Dodwana (19) from Chris Hani district. The cause of his death on Monday was being investigated, but the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs suspected dehydration. Spokesman Mamkeli Ngam said the summer season, like other seasons, was bad. The initial plan was zero deaths or no injuries. “We were expecting the number of arrests will be equal or more than the number of initiates who died,” said Ngam. He said the initiates were beaten and not treated well. “We’re expecting police to make breakthroughs and hope inquest dockets that have been opened will lead to arrests.” Ngam said going into the next season, they would look at this season’s report and at gaps in the Eastern Cape Customary Male Initiation Practice Act, which says no boy under 18 should be circumcised. He applauded monitoring teams in the province who rescued more than 60 initiates from illegal schools.
