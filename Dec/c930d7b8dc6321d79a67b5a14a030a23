TRANSPORT Minister Blade Nzimande said there had been 767 road deaths since the beginning of the festive season. He was briefing the media in Tshwane yesterday on the status of the preliminary festive season road safety campaign. According to Nzimande, there were 44 deaths from crashes involving five minibus taxis and trucks since the beginning of the campaign. “Minibus operators must consider havisng two drivers to relieve each other during long-distance journeys. “This is a small price to pay to avoid untold misery and pain. “A total of 767 fatalities have been recorded so far during this festive season, which is a 16% increase from the previous period.” Nzimande said Mzansi wouldn’t reach the United Nations target to reduce road deaths by 50% by 2020. The accident happened on the M4 highway yesterday. The vehicle caught fire after it swerved off the highway and plunged down an embankment. Eastern Cape traffic deputy director Charles Bramwell said the accident happened at about 4.50am. He said: “A VW Golf was travelling from North End towards Deal Party in Port Elizabeth when it collided with a barrier. It overturned numerous times before it came to a standstill and caught fire. “The occupants, two men and two women, were all fatally injured. The bodies were burnt beyond recognition. A case of culpable homicide was opened at Mount Road Police Station.”
