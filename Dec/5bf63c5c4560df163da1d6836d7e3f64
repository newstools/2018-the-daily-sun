THE Free State MEC for Health, Montseng Tsiu, has expressed shock at the rapidly increasing number of fatal road crashes in the province. In an interview with the SABC, she said: "We have put EMS personnel in all five major national roads that crisscross the province, namely N1, N3, N5, N6 and N8. Our personnel are well-positioned to respond to all types of emergencies, day and night, including provincial and local incidents." "We ask for people to take responsibility and prevent road fatalities. Our teams rapidly respond and are able to save lives in other instances, but where there are trucks and taxis in head-on collisions, survivors are few. It is too much to have the whole nine people dying in a single accident. One death is one too many," said Tsiu. "We send our condolences to the bereaved families and wish [a] speedy recovery to the injured. Please arrive alive," she said. By yesterday, 111 had lost their lives in 61 crashes in the Free State since the start of the festive season, according to the Free State Department of Police, Roads and Transport. During the same period last year, 125 people died. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/free-state-transport-mec-shocked-after-more-than-100-die-on-provinces-roads-20181225
