JOY was the order of the day for kids at Katlehong Day Care Centre in Grassland, Bloemfontein. On Saturday, Free State Agriculture MEC Benny Malakoane and Itau Milling donated a container with two classrooms to the centre. The children used to be taught in temporary rooms with a corrugated iron roof. The classrooms often leaked when it rained. “We came here to support the centre,” said Malakoane. “This is the beginning. The best is yet to come.” Malakoane encouraged the principal of the creche to create small vegetable gardens so the children could eat healthily. Fanti Hattingh, CEO at the milling company, told Daily Sun: “Our aim is to change the kids’ living conditions. “We value the importance of early childhood education. “That is why we are handing over this container to the centre. “We are here to plough back into the needy community.” He said they were planning to expand their partnership by helping with other necessities. He said they would talk to the principal. Principal Dimakatso Lehoke (46) said: “We are very happy to receive this container. “We have 45 children and they are going to learn in a safe environment.” Dimakatso thanked MEC Malakoane and the milling company for helping to change the lives of the kids for the better.
