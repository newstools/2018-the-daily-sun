AUTHORITIES have urged caution after nine people were
bitten by snakes in the space of just one day. According to news.com.au, snakes are on the loose in a
major way in Queensland, north east of Australia. The spate of attacks began on Tuesday night when a woman
in Carmoo was rushed to hospital after being bitten on her hand. Throughout Wednesday, people were admitted to other hospitals
around Queensland with bites to their feet, legs and hands. One was a child, but he is in a stable condition. No one died from the bites. Tony Harrison from Gold Coast and Brisbane Snake Catchers
said it was important for people to leave snakes alone in the warmer months. Tony said: “People see professionals on YouTube or
Facebook catching snakes and then they try and do it themselves. “Obviously our advice is to leave them alone and don’t
try and sort it yourself because that’s when accidental bites happen.” He also advised people not to leave piles of junk in
their gardens. “Don’t leave stuff lying around because that’s when you
get frogs, bird and mice moving in which is snake food,” he said. “Things like piles of rocks, wooden sleepers, tyres,
should all be moved away.” Poisonous snakes are common in this part of the world.
