A SCHOOLGIRL gave birth earlier this year after accusing her uncle of raping her over the past four years. The 14-year-old from Nongoma, northern KZN, was forced to drop out of grade 8 to look after the baby. A source told Daily Sun the girl and her eight-month-old baby were moved to a place of safety on 14 December following the suspect’s arrest on 10 December. “The police intervened after a concerned neighbour wrote them a letter mentioning that the uncle started raping the girl when she was 11,” said the source. Cops, along with the suspect’s mum and the victim’s gogo, then went to the village to look for the house where the suspect and the girl lived. “When police got there they interrogated him and he didn’t deny anything. He was then arrested,” the source told the People’s Paper. The gogo was apparently aware of the crime the whole time. “It’s not known if she feared for her life or wanted to protect her son,” said the source. Social development spokeswoman Ncumisa Ndelu said: “The department is working on the case, but because the matter involves a child I can’t give out any more information.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said a 29-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with rape. He appeared in the Nongoma Magistrates Court on 13 December.
