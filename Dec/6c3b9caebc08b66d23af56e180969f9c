PATRICIA de Lille is feeling extremely good about her new movement. In fact, even the party’s name is GOOD. She said after her relationship with the DA she realised there were many good South Africans. “This was after two years of racist abuse in the party,” De Lille said yesterday at the announcement of her new political home at a launch in Houghton, Joburg. She said they hoped to attract young people who appeared to be marginalised. “Some political parties are busy recycling old people who want to stay in Parliament for 15 years and draw a pension. “I want to hand over to young people, so they can experience politics.” De Lille was flanked by young people from different backgrounds. De Lille first formed the Independent Democrats. When she merged that with the DA she was appointed mayor of Cape Town. Her relationship with the DA went bad about two years ago. She said her movement’s name was simple and authentic. “It says quite boldly what we stand for. We are here to disrupt politics as usual,” she said. “We need to provide South Africans with more choices. I put my faith in the hands of South Africans,” De Lille said. She said her new party would contest elections in all nine provinces next year.
