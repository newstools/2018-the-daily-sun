MALUSI Gigaba could return to parliament after the elections next year. The former home affairs minister was nominated by KZN branches at the list conference which started on Wednesday. On the proposed national list seen by Daily Sun over the weekend, Gigaba is number 19. ANC provincial spokeswoman Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu confirmed that Gigaba was nominated. During the list conference, NEC member Nocawe Mafu said a member needed to be nominated by four provinces to qualify for a seat in parliament. The member needed to be nominated by four branches to be appointed to the Legislature. The women and youth leagues were regarded as provinces in this process. Gigaba resigned after Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane recommended that President Cyril Ramaphosa take action against him for lying under oath in the Fireblade matter. On the same list President Cyril Ramaphosa is first, followed by Deputy President David Mabuza. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma was third, followed by Zweli Mkhize. Senzo Mchunu was number six, followed by Nathi Mthethwa. Police Minister Bheki Cele and former Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini were also on the list. Premier Willies Mchunu appeared nowhere on all three lists seen by the People’s Paper. Also not on the lists were speaker Lydia Johnson and her deputy Meshack Radebe. Others who are likely not to make it back to the Legislature are Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo and Social Development MEC Weziwe Thusi. Simelane-Zulu refused to comment on the list. “The ANC has not released any list, so I won’t comment,” she said.
