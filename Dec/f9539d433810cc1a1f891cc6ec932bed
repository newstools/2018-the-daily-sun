AFTER going down 2-1 to Zimamoto FC in their Caf Confederation Cup semifinal second leg, Kaizer Chiefs advance to the second round 5-2 on aggregate. Amakhosi put the Tanzanian outfit to the sword with a 4-0 thumping at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth last week. The Soweto giants first-leg massive advantage at home was enough to take them through in this preliminary stage played at Amaan Stadium, Zanzibar in Tanzania yesterday. Coach Giovanni Solinas made wholesale changes for the clash against the minnows, Ryan Moon, Siphelele Ntshangase, goalkeeper Virgil Vries and Hendrik Ekstein, were some of the changes made from the Absa Premiership 2-1 defeat against Golden Arrows in Durban at the weekend. The win eased the pressure on the Italian mentor as things are not going well in the domestic league. New signing Lebogang Manyama scored his first official goal for the Glamour Boys as his away goal made the mission of overhauling Amakhosi impossible for the hosts. Yussuf Mtuba converted from the penalty spot in the first half to give his team hope before Manyamaâ€™s goal all but ended the match as a contest. Mtuba grabbed the winner from another penalty kick with 20 minutes remaining to give the home team the win. Due to the Telkom Knockout cup final this weekend, Chiefs will not be involved in action and the coach will no doubt hope to use the break to fix what has gone wrong in their camp on the domestic front.
