CHRISTMAS came early for these villagers. On Sunday, Word of Life Bible Church donated food parcels to gogos and the poor from different areas around Shatale, Bushbuckridge. One of the church leaders, Lindiwe Ndlovu (50), said it took them about six months to identify the beneficiaries and get the food. “As the church, we decided that every year we would donate Christmas gifts to the less privileged. “Some of the kids do not even know how it feels to be taken out for a pizza or something,” she said. Lindiwe said they had noticed that some gogos received food, but when they got home their kids and grandchildren took the food and left them starving. “Now we will check on the elderly on a weekly basis to see if they eat well and have enough food in their homes.” Gogo Masana Mdluli (83) was grateful to the church. She said the church was a blessing because it also gave poor kids pizza on the day. “It was nice to see poor kids enjoying pizza. The kids were so happy and full of smiles,” said Masana. “It might not seem much, but to us this is more than we could have asked for. I am happy because the food parcels will last me a month.”
