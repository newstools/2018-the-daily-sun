PEOPLE’s poet Mzwakhe Mbuli has labelled drunk drivers mamparas and killers! This is contained in his latest poem and comes as blood continues to flow on Mzansi roads this festive season. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mzwakhe said what triggered his latest poem was a tragic accident he saw in the news. Paramedics were killed after a drunk driver ploughed into them while they were helping patients. “It is hurtful to see such things. These people are killers,” said Mzwakhe. “Instead of preparing their children for school next month, people will be preparing for funerals when the festive season is over.” In his poem, accompanied by a video showing terrible car accidents, he says: “South Africa, siyaphela isizwe.”
