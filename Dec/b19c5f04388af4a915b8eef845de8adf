GOGO Agnes Masenya (74) cries as she tells how she lost her home. The gogo from Mabopane block D, north of Tshwane, said: “I was in the kitchen preparing food when one of my grandkids called out to say something was burning. When I got to my room the bed was in flames.” She tried to stop the fire with the water she had in the bucket, but it grew. “I thought I was dreaming when I saw the fire spread to other rooms. “My two grandkids and I ran out of the house. My neighbours rushed to help fight the blaze, but it was too strong.” She couldn’t believe she was homeless. “It really hurts when I think of what I’ve lost in the blaze,” said Agnes. She said she didn’t have money to fix her home and replace all her belongings. She and her husband are pensioners. “We’re left only with the clothes we’re wearing. I appeal to SunReaders to please help us with blankets, clothes and food.” She was also hoping people could help rebuild her house. Her daughter Lerato (33) said: “What’s important is that we’re alive. Material objects can be replaced.” They didn’t know what caused the fire.
