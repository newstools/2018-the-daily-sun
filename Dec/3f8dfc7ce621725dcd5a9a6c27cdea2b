UNDER her white doctor’s coat, Dr Sarah
Gray’s body is covered with colourful designs, making her "the world's
most tattooed doctor”, she believes. According to Daily Mail Australia, the
thirty-year-old from Adelaide, Australia got her first tattoo when she was just
16, and now just can’t get enough. But despite her respectable day job as a
medical doctor, Sarah often suffers from the stereotype people hold of those
with tattoos as being dodgy lowlives. She went to a fancy shoe shop recently
to buy a $1 000 (about R10 300) but was snootily ignored by three shop assistants. "They all served other customers
first and wouldn't even make eye contact with me," she told Daily Mail
Australia. "I waited politely for ages and
eventually gave up and left. They did themselves out of a sale and I saved
myself $1 000, so I guess that's one bonus!" She was even kicked out of a restaurant with
her husband once because of her tattoos. "After being seated for lunch,
management then came up to us and asked us to leave as they had a 'no visible
tattoo policy' for diners," Sarah said. The doctor said she gets very frustrated
with people judging those who love tattoos just because of their
"colourful skin."
