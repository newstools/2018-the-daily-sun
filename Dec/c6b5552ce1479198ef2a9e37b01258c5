THE white house must be destroyed! These were the words of Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane as she led a walk in Tshwane on Saturday. Just when the MEC arrived at the house, a nyaope boy collapsed. Medical officials were called to the scene. The house is believed to house drug dealers and to be used for prostitution. Residents said the boy collapsed because he did not get a fix as the place was full of police and community safety officials. Residents were angry and told Nkosi-Malobane that police had informed drug dealers and prostitutes early in the morning that she was coming. Nkosi-Malobane took part in a safety outreach programme against gender-based violence, including the walk that started in Jubilee Park in Sunnyside. She was accompanied by senior members from various law enforcement agencies, community leaders and civil society representatives. “The abuse of women and children is linked to drugs and alcohol. I will talk to the MMC for safety and the mayor about the building being sealed off or destroyed,” she said. During her walk she interacted with community members. Community Policing Forum chairman Sandile Dube said residents were worried about the high rate of crime, drugs and domestic violence. “The MEC’s visit was important for her to witness our challenges first-hand,” he said. He said the white house should be demolished. Reverend Albert Mkhonza of St Michael Anglican in Sunnyside said it was a good initiative which should be done regularly. “We gave spiritual support and we want the abuse of women and children to stop,” he said. Ward 81 councillor Godfrey Mulaudzi said the youth drop out of school because of drugs.
