FOR many the welcoming of a new year is an incomplete celebration without a shower of sparks in the sky! But there’s a warning from officials about shooting crackers. It’s important to remember that it’s not a free for all and there are laws that regulate the use of fireworks. Joburg’s Emergency Management Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi shared a variety of videos where shops in the Joburg CBD were raided by them and the JMPD to check if owners have compliance certificate. “We want to make sure that our residents enjoy their New Year’s celebration safely,” said Mulaudzi. “If a shop owner does not have any certificate, we confiscate the fireworks and issue a fine of at least R1 500.” Mulaudzi said one of the by-laws included that fireworks may not be set off in public places. This includes parks, on the pavement or in the streets. Shopping malls, restaurants, liquor stores and clothing retailers were also off limits. “At this time of the year, we see many people on hospital benches with serious injuries sustained from fireworks,” he said. “I hope I won’t see a single patient with injuries from these explosives this time.” He said they often treated people with injured fingers that may need to be amputated, eyes and facial injuries and other wounds. “Fireworks have also caused fires, which can result in someone’s house being damaged,” he said. “It is better not to have fireworks or leave them to those who know how to use them.” He said the trauma and suffering fireworks causes to animals is well-documented.
