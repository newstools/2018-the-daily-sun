ANC Limpopo secretary Soviet Lekganyane has urged party members to put Mzansi citizens first. He said access to water and sanitation should be improved. He was addressing a crowd gathered to celebrate the party’s Wednesday by-election win in Mogalakwena Municipality’s ward 10, outside Mokopane. Lekganyane urged councillors to prove themselves. “While significant work has been done in this area to improve the quality of life for our residents, we’re conscious of the fact that more work needs to be done to improve provision of water and sanitation, road connectivity, housing development and job creation,” said Lekganyane. “Our municipality is working on speeding up implementation of development projects, as spelled out in the integrated development plan.” “We will ensure that all projects are implemented with speed – efficiently and qualitatively.” He said Councillor Kgadile Majadibodu had received instructions from the ANC to honour and respect voters. Last week, Majadibodu reportedly survived an attack when the car he was driving was shot at and later caught fire in Marulaneng Village, outside Mokopane. The motive behind the shooting is still unknown, but political infighting has not been ruled out. Lekganyane said Majadibodu would always be available to communities and remain a service delivery champion.
