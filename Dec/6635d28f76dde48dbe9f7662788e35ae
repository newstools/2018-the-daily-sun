HIS album Touch My Blood went platinum and its lead single Fela Versace became an anthem on all music platforms and mediums. Now AKA, also known as Supamega is finding himself in a rather awkward position. This as EFF commander- in- chief, Julius Malema is question why he is getting so much airplay. During a recent presser, Malema questioned why AKA was getting so much airplay on radio. He said in order to deal with the issues of payola, this issue first needed to be dealt with, because ordinary artists don’t get as much airplay. But, in an attempt to exonerate himself, AKA posted a list of songs that were played most on radio and demanded to know why Malema was “singling me out”. He wrote on Twitter: “This is the list of the top played songs on SA RADIO this year. Julius Malema I just want to ask why you specifically singled me out while talking about Payola?”
