THESE thugs helped illegal immigrants to get “citizenship”. And that is not all. They sold birth certificates, ID documents and fraudulent papers. But that’s all in the past after police pounced on the syndicate. Three suspects were arrested on Tuesday for producing fraudulent Home Affairs certificates in Pretoria West, Tshwane. Police spokeswoman Constable Sibongile Vuma said police acted on a tip-off that led them to a house in President Burgers Street shortly after 1pm. Said Vuma: “Two men and a woman aged between 35 and 45 were arrested and police seized fraudulent visas, Home Affairs stamps, passports and asylum papers.” A case of fraud was opened at the Pretoria West Police Station and police are investigating. All three suspects will appear in court soon.
