 Lobby group Black People's National Crisis Committee will lead a protest march to Clifton Beach on Friday. The group will also hold a cleansing ceremony calling for the end of the exclusion of black people at the beach. "The offering of the sheep is calling on our ancestors to respond to our trauma at the hands of white people over the years," activist Chumani Maxwele told News24 on Thursday.   "We were requested to accompany law enforcement as our tactical officers are highly trained and skilled professionals. If anyone claims they were on the beach and chased away they would have seen that it was absolute mayhem and that law enforcement were really doing a great job to stabilise the situation â€“ we did not close the beach," PPA CEO Alwyn Landman told News24.  "These private security guards are hired by the Clifton Taxpayers Association, they are actually briefed to not allow black people who appear to look like they are from the townships or criminals onto the beach," he alleged. The activist said that the citing of an alleged rape incident by the security company as the reason it maintained law and order on the beach was a lie. "If you go to the Clifton Beach now you will find the PPA there, this is not an isolated case.    "We will no longer be assisting the police, the metro police, anyone," advocate Bruce Hendricks told News24 on Thursday on behalf of PPA Security. He said the company was contracted by residents in the area to provide private security and would still patrol for its clients, which include restaurants in nearby Camps Bay. Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith and the City's safety and security head, Richard Bosman, were also meeting various law enforcement authorities on Thursday to get to the bottom of what occurred at the beach. Smith said that private companies had no right to police public spaces, and that PPA was not acting on the City's authority. "No, they had not been given permission. They don't answer to us," he said. Investigation into alleged assault Western Cape police said on Thursday they were investigating reports of an incident of attempted sexual violation in the vicinity of Clifton Beach last Saturday in which beachgoers apparently intervened. Police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said police had also launched an investigation into reported claims that two teenagers had been raped on the beach on December 22.           News24
