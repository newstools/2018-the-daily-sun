THIS time last year, initiation deaths in the Eastern Cape stood at 15. This summer season, which started last November, the number now stands at 17 with the death of Songe Tsondwa (20) and Zukisani Madonono (18) from the Chris Hani district. Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders and Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa chairman Inkosi Mwelo Nonkonyana said they were disappointed. Corporate governance spokesman Mamkeli Ngam said Tsondwa from Ndonga Village died of suspected dehydration and septicaemi. Madonono from Molteno died of suspected dehydration. Nonkonyana said they worked hard before the start of the season to make sure there were no deaths. “It has transpired that there are people and parents who’re determined to continue to initiate boys without following any custom and disregarding the law,” he said. He said it was clear some of the initiates were illegally circumcised. “We regard this situation as a disaster. We call upon all our people to stop the senseless killing of the innocent children. “We want everyone, especially the older men, to take their rightful place and stop this carnage.” He said parents who worked with the illegal cutters must be brought to book. “We’re working to stop this situation. The custom shouldn’t cause death or injury to the initiate. It’s something that we all must make sure doesn’t happen again.” He sent his condolences to parents who lost their children.
