 The Anti-Gang Unit (AGU) has arrested five people after two children and a woman were killed. Five people wounded, in drive-by shootings in Cape Town's Bishop Lavis on Christmas Eve. Police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said they were arrested in an operation that started in Athlone in the early hours of Thursday. "In the early hours of this morning, the members descended on an informal settlement in Athlone, where they arrested a 23-year-old suspect and seized several items including medical supplies, R29 000 in cash, cellphones and a gas welder with regulators," said Potelwa.    In another shooting in the same area, a 56-year-old woman was killed and three people were injured. They are being treated in hospital. "I would like to extend my sincere condolences to the families who lost their loved ones in these cowardly attacks. "I encourage community members to share any additional information they might have with the [police], so that any outstanding suspects can be arrested. We will track all cases, as we have to ensure that these heartless criminals face the full might of the law and, once found guilty, are sentenced to lengthy jail terms." He commended the police for their swift action in making the arrests. A number of people were also taken in for questioning after the shootings. Potelwa said the five people would appear in court in Bishop Lavis soon. Meanwhile, a group of shocked and angry residents planned to picket at the Bishop Lavis police station on Thursday. They feel nobody is paying attention to the horrors they have to live with. "No outcry, no national media attention. Now imagine two children get killed in, say for instance, Constantia. There would have been an outcry," read a statement issued ahead of the picket.
