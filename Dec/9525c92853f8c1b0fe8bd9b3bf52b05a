A GAMER from Sydney, Australia who
livestreamed himself assaulting his pregnant wife has been arrested. According to news.com.au, a gamer who
calls himself MrDeadMoth was playing the popular game Fortnite on Twitch on
Monday. At first the fight with his wife was
vicious words. She was angry with him because she had made
dinner for him an hour ago but he refused to leave his computer to go and eat. To her pleas for reason, the 26-year-old
man screams mean words like: “Go away, f**k, leave me alone. Just leave me
alone for 10 f**king minutes of your life. Why don’t you listen?” “F**k off you dog, you don’t pay the
f**king bills,” he adds at a later point. His wife and two kids can be heard
crying in the background. They have two daughters aged three and
20 months. The gamer then got up from his computer
and the sound of a slap can be heard. His 21-year-old wife sobs louder off
camera, as he says: “How many times do I have to tell you? I said I’d be out
soon.” “You hear that, all those people there,”
his wife tells the livestream. “I cooked him dinner an hour ago and he
refuses to eat it,” she adds. The livestream went viral on Twitter. In a statement, local cops said: “While
the woman was not seriously injured she was distressed and shaken by the
incident. An apprehended violence order has been
served.”
