The police's anti-drug unit has arrested a 25-year-old suspect in Westbury, Joburg, for possession of drugs worth over R100 000. This follows an "intensive intelligence-driven operation" in the area. "Six hundred units of Mandrax tablets with an estimated street value of over R100 000 were seized," said police spokesperson Mavela Masondo on Thursday. Just down the road from Westbury, police in Sophiatown arrested eight suspects for crimes ranging from murder, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and housebreaking. They are expected to appear in court soon. "We are clamping down on serious crimes in the area," Masondo said. The anti-gang unit was deployed in Westbury to reinforce the various units that are responsible for finding and arresting drug dealers and gangsters in the area. The unit was launched by President Cyril Ramaphosa in Hanover Park on November 2, after the killing of Heather Petersen who was hit during a shootout between rival gangs in Westbury. Her murder sparked community outrage, with violent protests erupting and residents demanding the arrest of the suspects and the deployment of more police units to deal with gangsterism in the area.     "Arrests of this nature also serve as a warning to those who continue to smuggle drugs in Westbury in particular and Gauteng in general," Masondo said.
