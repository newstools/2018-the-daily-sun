FACEBOOK romance sometimes leads to love, but on other occasions it leads to disappointment and frustration. In a video that has been circulating on social media, a man is seen accusing a woman of sending him pictures of another person. “Don’t drive me crazy. You claimed you were sending pictures of yourself but it wasn’t you. “All this time I thought I was depositing money into a beautiful woman’s bank account when I was actually sending money to a gogo.” The video was reportedly taken in Durban. The pair apparently met on Facebook, and the man instantly fell in love. The video begins with the man standing up and pointing at her. “Give me my money back,” he says. A security guard walks towards their table to investigate. “This woman sent me fake pictures telling me that it’s her,” says the man to the guard. Eventually, the woman has enough of the man’s performance. “It’s not my fault you go around clicking ‘like’ on Facebook,” she said.
