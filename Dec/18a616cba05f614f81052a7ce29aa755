THREE government service providers say they were called in to cater at a career exhibition in July with a promise of being paid. Five months later all three claim they have nothing to show for it. Mojalefa Tsolo, Tebogo Makofane and Themba Mohapi say they were hired to provide catering services at a career exhibition held at Tlapa Village outside Rustenburg, North West, on 28 June. According to the trio they spoke to the Rustenburg Local Municipality and the Department of Higher Education and Training. Themba owns Marikana Vision catering and is allegedly owed R111 000. Tebogo owns Baithusi 66 and claims he is owed R91 000. Mojalefa Taolo owns Let’s Move and he, too, is allegedly owed R91 000. “We always did our job without any orders, and they would pay us without orders. What is different now? “They should deal with this and give us our money,” Themba said. They said they do not have formal contracts with the municipality or the department. The municipality has denied owing the three companies money. The municipality’s spokesman, David Magae, said they were aware of the career expo but claimed the service providers were hired by the Department of Higher Education and Training. The department’s media spokesman, Lunga Ngqengelele, said: “We cannot pay for services we are not sure of. We know of the expo, but not the people claiming the department owes them. ‘Without proof of contract, we cannot do anything.”
