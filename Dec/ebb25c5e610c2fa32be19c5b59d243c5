SANRAL has shared information on its new projects with businesspeople of Mangaung. The roads agency hosted its Taking Sanral to the People programme at the Mangaung Indoor Centre on Thursday. It was part of its drive to inform businesses, communities and other stakeholders of opportunities in the construction industry. The Eastern Cape regional manager, Dumisani Nkabinde, said: “Through this programme Sanral shares information with stakeholders about its continuing role in infrastructure development, job creation and skills development initiatives. We also discuss issues of mutual interest.” Nkabinde also said they would form a Free State transport forum. He said it would also include provincial and municipal representatives who will send out messages to transport industry stakeholders. “All transport entities will participate in the co-ordinated planning of initiatives and will speak with a single voice on issues.” He said they were committed to transforming the transport industry to include more black contractors, professionals and suppliers. Nthoana Klaas (35), MD of LPK Civil and Structural Engineers Company, said: “I feel the engagement was not given enough time. That was a let-down. My challenge was the issue of procurement. “When you start a company and apply for a tender, you might not get it because of lack of experience. “I think they must come up with a strategy to accommodate emerging companies.”
