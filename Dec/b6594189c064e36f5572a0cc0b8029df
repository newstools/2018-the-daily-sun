IT WAS a bleak Christmas for the Mosunkutu family. Nonqaba Mosunkutu, wife of former Gauteng transport MEC Khabisi Mosunkutu (68), said she did her best to revive him. But her efforts were in vain. The struggle veteran died on Monday. It is believed Mosunkutu died from complications related to the stroke he suffered in July. He was admitted to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital for physiotherapy but was allegedly denied help by a nurse. Nonqaba said on the night of his death, her husband collapsed as he was being taken to bed. Soon afterwards, Mosunkutu started foaming at the mouth. That is when Nonqaba, a nurse by profession, tried to revive him. She said she forgave the nurse who reportedly refused to help her husband. “As a mother and pastor, I have to forgive. I can’t hold a grudge against her,” she said. A delegation of the ANC’s provincial and regional structures paid their last respects to the former MEC at his home in Kibler Park, south of Joburg, yesterday. ANC treasurer-general Paul Mashatile, Arts and Culture MEC Faith Mazibuko, and provincial deputy chairman Panyaza Lesufi were present. Mashatile said: “We need to take this opportunity to celebrate his life because he was committed to the end.”
