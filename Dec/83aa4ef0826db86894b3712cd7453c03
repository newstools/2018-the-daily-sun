SOME victims who lost everything in the Alex fire told Daily Sun they may struggle for a long time to rebuild their shacks because they don’t have building materials. There are allegations that people from other parts of Alexandra – who were not affected by the fires – have been queuing for donations. This means that people who need building material are left out, as the distribution of such materials is done while they are at work. Nobuntu Thanzi (32) said some people were taking advantage of the terrible situation and using building materials to build shacks in neighbouring sections and rent them out. “My sister and I moved in with our mother in the nearby extension because we can’t build.” She wanted to take her children to Mount Frere in Eastern Cape, until she had found a decent place to live. “We live with my mum. There are nine people in the house. We are forced to stay there because we have nothing at the moment.” She was saddened that others took advantage of the situation because it left those who could afford to buy material without roofs over their heads. John Serai (31) said they saw the cheaters in the queue but couldn’t say anything. “We were too scared to do anything,” he said. “I’m almost done with my shack, but there will be a shortage of zinc because I had to share with others.” On Tuesday, the Department of Human Settlements and the Disaster Management Centre called off all donations. Spokesman Keith Khoza, said: “Our Disaster Management Centre is no longer taking any donations.”
