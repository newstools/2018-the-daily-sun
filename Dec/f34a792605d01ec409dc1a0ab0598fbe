THERE will be no trains at Pretoria Station for 40 days. Commuters have been advised to find alternative transport. The station closes on Friday until 22 January. Gauteng Metrorail spokeswoman Lillian Mofokeng said the closure was for maintenance. They will replace old signals, switches and points as part of Prasa’s modernisation effort. “The new infrastructure will be safer, faster, smoother and a world-class service with improved travelling times.” Tickets will only be sold to commuters travelling between listed stations. Commuter Angel Kekana (46) said: “We’re happy about the modernisation programme. They’re putting in new systems.”
