GEORGE Mbathu (65) believes he was illegally kept in prison and was unlawfully stripped of his job at the SAPS in the North West. He was fired for a criminal record for a theft that happened in 1991, and since 1995 has been fighting to get his job back. “The police arrived and took me to the Klerksdorp prison,” said George. But last year correctional services in a letter claimed George was never imprisoned. “They claim I was never in jail, but still say I was on parole,” said George. The parole letter, which Daily Sun has seen, states that George was on parole from February 1994 till April 1995. SAPS spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said George’s matter was finalised on 25 November 2013 in the Labour Court. “Mbathu was found guilty, convicted of theft on 5 January 1991 and sentenced to imprisonment,” said Mokgwabone. “Thus he was discharged from the service,” he said. Tshidi Mapole from the Department of Correctional Services said Mbathu was jailed in Klerksdorp from 1992 and placed on parole from 1994 until his sentence expired in 1995. Mapole said the department enforces the decision of the courts. “They don’t incarcerate any person without having received a lawful warrant of detention,” she said. Mapole said official records have to be applied for.
