ZIONISTS have learnt with shock of the passing of Archbishop Elias Mureri of the United African Apostolic Church. Mureri of Ha-Mavhunga in Nzhelele outside Makhado, Limpopo, passed away on Saturday after a long illness, church spokesman Rollet Nenzhelele said. He could not provide further details but said the family and the church were saddened by the 78-year-old’s death. He said the family would announce more details and funeral arrangements later. Messages of condolences have started pouring in. Chief Livhuwani Matsila, the archbishop’s right-hand man and close confidant, said his passing was a great tragedy. “I am heartbroken and emotionally torn as I confront the reality that I will never again share with him the special moments we had in church sessions and the warm hospitality at his home,” said Matsila. “He was a true angel of God who comforted me and my family during trying times. We pray for the Mureri family in these hard times so that God may bless them.” The church was founded by the archbishop’s father Bishop Paulos Mureri in 1912. The Pentecostal church developed from missionary origins with African beliefs to a full African-initiated church. It is considered to be the second largest of such churches in South Africa.
