A WOMAN from Vanderbijlpark in the Vaal found worms inside a 10kg Maize Meal bag she just bought from grocery store Checkers. The video was shared on Twitter by popular user @AdvBarryRoux, or Man’s Not Barry Roux. It attacked comments from angry people who said they were disappointed at Checkers. The woman recently bought a bag of Iwisa Maize Meal from Checkers. The expiry date on the package says 18 June 2019. But when she opened it and emptied the package into a container, she found worms. The woman, who is speaking Sotho, could be heard in the video saying: “Please be careful when you go buy products out there. “The date says it expires next year but here we found worms inside. “Let’s be careful when we cook, or we will eat strange things and be sick. “I'm disturbed, the kids are disturbed, in fact we are all disturbed,” she said. Checkers replied to Man’s Not Barry Roux in a tweeted saying: "Thank you for your concern. We are in the process of addressing this, as it is not the quality we want to offer our customers."
