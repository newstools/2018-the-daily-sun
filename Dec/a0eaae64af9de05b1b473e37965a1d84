ORLANDO Pirates have embarked on a journey to conquer the continent in their quest to win the Caf Champions League for only the second time in 23 years. Bucs will take on Seychelles outfit Light Stars in the second leg of their preliminary stage clash at Amitie Stadium today (2.30pm SA time). Pirates are expected to easily secure a place in the next round of the competition having walloped Light Stars 5-1 in the first leg played at Orlando Stadium last week. Veteran Bucs captain Happy Jele knows the size of task ahead for them, having come close to lifting the trophy in 2013. Unfortunately their dream of emulating the 1995 side went up in smoke when they lost 3-1 on aggregate to Egyptian side Al Ahly in the final. Said Jele: “I was there when we reached the 2013 final. I remember how close we came and how much we wanted to clinch the Champions League trophy, particularly for our supporters. Now that we have another chance it is key that we start things off on the right foot and build momentum from there.” Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic will again rely on fringe players like Thabo Qalinge, Kudakwashe Mahachi and Meshack Maphangule to do the job. He is expected to rest his regulars, including fan favourite and Bafana Bafana winger Vincent Pule, for the Telkom Knockout final against Baroka FC at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday (6pm). However, Pirates will need to keep a close eye on Stars dangerman Mario Ravo, who scored their consolation goal in the first leg. A win on aggregate over Light Stars will see Pirates meet the winner of the clash between Volcan do Moroni of Comoros and Namibian side African Stars at Sam Nujoma Stadium in Windhoek today. The teams drew goalless in the first leg played at Stade de Moroni, in Comoros last week.
