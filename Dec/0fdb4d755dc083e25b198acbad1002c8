A WOMAN gatvol with being sexually harassed by her neighbour
lured him to a quiet spot before slicing off his 4-5. She and her accomplices then rushed him to hospital in a
desperate bid to save his life, according to Daily Monitor. The unnamed 47-year-old woman from Mumbai was apparently
constantly being harassed by her 27-year-old neighbour for sex. No matter how much she begged him to leave her alone, he just
wouldn’t give up. He once even told her husband that he was in love with her,
causing a huge fight between the couple. Finally the mum-of-two could take it no more. On Tuesday, the woman allegedly enlisted two men who
lived in her neighbourhood to help her. The two men asked the stalker to come
with them to an isolated industrial zone, where the woman was waiting with a
knife. After attacking him and chopping off his 4-5, they rushed
him to hospital. Media reports say he is still alive after undergoing lifesaving
surgery. Senior Inspector Gajanan Kabdule told AFP: "We have
arrested the woman and two accomplices and she has accepted it was her plan to
chop off the stalker's penis because of his constant harassment. "We recovered the knife and genitals and all three
accused are in police custody.”
