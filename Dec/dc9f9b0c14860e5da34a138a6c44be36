WHEN they heard their daughter had escaped from rehab and broken into their home, they opened a case against her. But none of that is important, now that their daughter is no more. The Makallas from Mathibela in Zebediela, Limpopo, are mourning the death of their daughter Dibusheng (24). She jumped out of a moving bakkie! It happened after a cop allegedly handcuffed her, put her on the back of his open bakkie, and drove to Zebediela cop shop. Dibusheng apparently jumped out of the vehicle and later died in hospital. Her uncle, Pastor Solly Makalla (40), admitted that Dibusheng had a serious nyaope problem. But when her parents opened a case against her, they never thought cops would bring her back home in a coffin. “All that Dibusheng’s parents wanted was for her to learn the hard way so she could change her bad ways,” said Solly. “We just want the truth. The detective said he handcuffed her. “But how do you transport a suspect on the back of an open bakkie?” Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini confirmed that a death in police custody case was reported and was being investigated. “No one has been arrested. We’re not aware of any poor communication between the investigating officer and the family,” said Dlamini. “Circumstances surrounding the death of the young woman will be investigated, including checking if cops complied with standing orders.”
