ALOT of things have been going his way recently, he celebrated his album Touch My Blood going platinum and now AKA, better known as the super mega has something to smile about yet again. He announced on his twitter account that he now has his own app from which his legion of fans can get “great content from”. He parted ways with his business Beam Group, because he said it wasn’t working for him, even though he owned seventy percent of the business. Now the star has his own app. He wrote: “Great news for me today finally ... the app that launched as the Beam World App ... is now officially the AKA WORLD APP ... This means I can now concentrate on giving you guys the BEST, most exclusive content”.
