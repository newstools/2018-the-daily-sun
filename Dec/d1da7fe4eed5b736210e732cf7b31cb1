BANYANA Banyana players have given no indication that they will run out of gas anytime soon, instead vowing to complete what they started by winning the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations in Ghana at the weekend. They seem unfazed by their qualification for the 2019 Fifa World Cup, where they will be making their debut, and are instead focused on the fight ahead against Nigeria for the title of “Queens of Africa”. Accra Stadium in Ghana will become a battlefield on Saturday (8pm SA time) when South Africa and Nigeria battle it out for the trophy that has eluded Desiree Ellis so far. Their 2-0 victory over Mali in the Women’s Afcon semifinals on Tuesday secured their spot at the World Cup, which was their main mission when they left South Africa on 9 November. Players from both Banyana and Nigeria will go into the encounter brimming with confidence after their World Cup dreams came true. Banyana defender Bambanani “Juice” Mbane said they were ready for war: “The job is not done yet. We are happy to have qualified for the World Cup but we are still hungry for more. “This is our chance to shine. We can’t be happy with winning the Cosafa Cup each year. We need to grow and start winning Afcon.” Mbane, who played in all their Acfon matches, partnering captain Janine van Wyk at centre-back, is aware the Super Falcons will fight to the bitter end. “But we will be ready,” she said. “I feel like we also need to stamp our authority in Africa to go to France with lot of confidence.” Captain Van Wyk, one of the senior players in the team, said: “We had targets when we came here, and for us to say we came and conquered, we would need to lift the trophy. It has been a long journey for us but the job is not done yet.
