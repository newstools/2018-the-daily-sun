THE police force has welcomed 3 701 new members. The force held three passing-out parades at its different academies on Friday in Gauteng, Eastern Cape and Western Cape. National police commissioner General Khehla Sitole said about 2 445 newly trained cops were from Tshwane Academy, while 825 graduated from Bisho Police Academy, and 431 graduated from Oudtshoorn Academy. “The newly trained cops were the third intake from the revised basic police training, which was introduced in 2016,” he said. Sitole said the training programme allowed cops to provide an effective and efficient policing service to ensure that people of South Africa felt safe. Addressing the graduates in Tshwane, Sitole told them they’d join other cops to ensure the country enjoyed a safe, peaceful festive season. “Always remember to be vigilant and abide by the basic safety rules and regulations, because your safety is important,” he told Daily Sun. Delivering the keynote address, Police Minister Bheki Cele encouraged the new recruits to be outstanding cops in their communities. He urged them to continue fighting gender-based violence. Cele said they must know their ministerial six-point plan on how they should respond to women and children in distress. “I’m confident the young ladies will play their role in eradicating this scourge,” he said. “I want to make a special call to the young male cops who’re passing out to assist our ladies and form a brand new battalion of vicious watchdogs whose responsibility is to rid the community of and protect our women and kids gainst these monsters.”
