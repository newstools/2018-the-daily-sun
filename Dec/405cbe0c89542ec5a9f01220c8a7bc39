JOBURG’s Mayor Herman Mashaba laid criminal charges against ex-mayor Parks Tau. He also laid charges against former MMC for finance and current leader of the ANC’s Joburg region, Geoff Makhubu. The charges, which include fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering against the two, were opened at the Joburg Central Police Station. Mashaba said he laid the charges after strong evidence emerged, which was provided by an amaBhungane report. The investigative journalists’ report looked into alleged collusion between the two and Regiments Fund Managers. He said: “The depth of criminality and the arrogance displayed by the ANC, Makhubo and Tau is astounding to say the least. “The ANC, and particularly Makhubo and Tau, have consistently fought the multi-party government’s efforts to combat corruption in the city. “It is now clear to see why. “While they have the chance, Tau and Makhubo must do the right thing and resign from public office,” said Mashaba. He said the investigative report conducted by amaBhungane showed how Makhubo and Tau allegedly masterminded a R30-million windfall to the benefit of Makhubo, by allowing him to unduly act as broker for Regiments Fund Managers, giving the fund managers unfettered access to lucrative deals within the city.
