EMPLOYEES of an acid maker in Richards Bay, KZN, have threatened massive protest action. Workers picketed outside the premises on Thursday, saying management was playing with their lives after a worker died there on Wednesday. Numsa shop steward Stanley Zungu said Mduduzi Mthembu was found dead at work, soon after they complained about high pH levels in water used to flush acid. “We’re not happy about how management is handling our safety. “On the day that Mduduzi was killed, we told management the pH level in the water was very high.” He said pH is the measurement of the amount of chemicals in the water they use during acid manufacturing . “Management turned a blind eye and Mduduzi lost his life.” He said the pH level should be between seven and nine. “On the day Mdududzi died, the pH level was at 11. We told management so they could call off production to allow for neutralisation of the pH level but they didn’t.” He said management seemed to want production to go on, despite the danger. The SunTeam emailed general manager Ezra Mlambo on Sunday. During a call yesterday, we were told to call Thembisa Jobe, who said they would send an official statement that never came.
