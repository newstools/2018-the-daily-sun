AFRO pop singer and songwriter Orien “Madala” Mabasa is ready to take music lovers on a beautiful journey. “I enjoy making music that reminds people of love,” said Madala. He’s originally from Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga but now lives in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. The musician told SunBuzz people love his work. He said one of the highlights of his career was when he worked with legendary kwaito musician Doc Shebeleza. “I enjoyed travelling and performing with him, as well as meeting my fans. “My music touches my supporters in different ways.” Last month Madala released a single called Khensani. He said the song is about love and patience. He plans to release another single next year. He asked his fans to be patient with him while he perfected his songs in his studio. The musician said he has performed in a number of countries such as Botswana and Mozambique. Madala said travelling across the continent had allowed him to learn a lot about music and the importance of supporting other musicians. Madala said his festive season tour was an opportunity for his fans to get up close and personal with him. He said he previously shared the stage with Amos K, Soldierman, as well as with DJ KN. His dream is to collaborate with legendary disco singer and songwriter Freddie Qwala. “We have a lot in common and that makes me happy. “I feel blessed to be around people who want to teach others about music.”
