WHEN cops spotted the man pushing a wheelbarrow, their first thought was that it was normal. But when it appeared the man was trying to herd three sheep at the same time, the patrolling cops became suspicious. Their suspicions proved correct when they uncovered a slaughtered sheep on the wheelbarrow. And when they added their find to the fact that the man had been seen earlier driving a taxi, they bust open his entire livestock theft operation. They found a further 15 live sheep inside the white combi. The 33-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with possession of stolen livestock. The arrest happened in Tweeling, Free State, on Thursday. Police spokesman Captain Zweli Mohobeleli said: “Investigations led officers to a white combi, which was seen driven by the suspect earlier. “The combi and a further 15 live sheep were recovered. “Brand marks on the sheep led officers to a farm near Tweeling, where the theft occurred. A fence had been cut open. He will appear before the court soon.” Acting Bethlehem cluster commander Brigadier Nkaise Molefe warned butchery and shisa nyama owners involved in stock theft that they would be arrested. “We are working on positively linking business owners to the thefts. “Those who frequent these eateries must demand to know where the meat comes from, lest they become inadvertently involved in stock theft. Farmers should continue to mark and count their stock to ensure early detection and recovery.”
