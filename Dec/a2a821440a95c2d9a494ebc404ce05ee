‘WHY you driving with white people? You’re black, you’re
ugly. You should just die.” This is one of the vicious, cruel comments made by fellow
pupils that are believed to have driven McKenzie Adams (9) to kill herself. According to the New York Post, the shocking tragedy
happened in a town in Alabama, in America’s deep south, on 3 December. McKenzie hung herself. Her lifeless body was discovered by her gogo. This week, her aunt Edwina Harris said that McKenzie had
been moved from another school just a year ago because of the relentless
bullying she suffered there. But things got even more brutal at her new school, US
Jones Elementary School, whose motto is “Where hope begins and dreams come
true”. Edwina told The Columbus Dispatch: “She was being bullied
the entire school year, with words such as ‘kill yourself,’ ‘you think you’re
white because you ride with that white boy,’ ‘you ugly,’ ‘black b**ch,’ ‘just
die’.” Her mum, Jasmine Adams, told CBS42: “Part of it could
have been because she drove to school with a white family. “And a lot of it was race — some of the student bullies
would say to her, ‘Why you driving with white people? You’re black, you’re
ugly. You should just die.’” The school is yet to comment, according to reports. The shattered family described McKenzie as a smart kid
who loved maths and wanted to become a scientist. She was happiest at the zoo
or the beach and loved making funny videos with her cousins. Hundreds of people are expected to attend her funeral,
which is being held today.
