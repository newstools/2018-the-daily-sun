Cape Town City FC have confirmed the signing of former Orlando Pirates striker Kermit Erasmus from Portuguese outfit Vitoria de Setubal. Erasmus has seen a decline in his fortunes while in Europe since his move from Pirates to Rennes in 2015/16. He struggled for playing time in France's Ligue 1 and also spent time on loan at second tier outfit Lens. The former SuperSport United forward later moved to Sweden's Eskilstuna for a short spell before arriving at Vitoria in 2018/19. Erasmus has also fallen out of favour with Bafana Bafana following his struggles in Europe and was last in the squad in 2017 for the back-to-back defeats against Cape Verde in 2018 World Cup qualifying. Meanwhile, City have not confirmed the details of the 28-year-old's contract but it has been rumoured that Tokelo Rantie and Matthew Rusike will depart from the club in upcoming the January transfer. On Tuesday, the Citizens let slip an early lead in a Absa Premiership clash as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Chippa United at Athlone Stadium.
