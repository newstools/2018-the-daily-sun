Local beauty queen, Thulisa Keyi’s Miss World dream was cut short when she failed to advance beyond the Top 30 eliminations last night in Sanya, China. The 68th edition of the pageant saw 118 contestants from around the world compete for the crown with 24-year-old Miss Mexico, Vanessa de León walking away with the title. Our contestant, Miss World South Africa Thulisa Keyi made the Top 30 at the pageant in China but was unfortunately illuminated when the judges made their choice for the top 12. The 26-year-old from Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape flew the flag for Mzansi after she was crowned Miss World SA in May this year. In the lead up to the finale, Thulisa scooped the Miss World Designer Award, which she shared with Miss China, and also placed in the Top 5 for Miss World Top Model. Although that wasn’t enough to advance her any further, the Miss World Organisation remains proud of our local girl. “We are incredibly proud of Thulisa. She worked really hard in the build-up to Miss World and we are delighted that she made the Top 30,” said Group PR manager at Sun International, Claudia Henkel. Former Miss South Africa and Miss World 2014, Rolene Strauss was one of the judges at this year’s Miss World pageant. Miss South Africa 2018, Tamaryn Green will take part in the 67th annual Miss Universe pageant, taking place on Monday, 17 December, in Bangkok, Thailand. Should Tamaryn win the Miss Universe title, Thulisa will take over as Miss South Africa.
