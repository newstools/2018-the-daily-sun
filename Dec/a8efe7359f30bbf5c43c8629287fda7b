THE land debate makes business owners edgy. That’s why Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina talked to them yesterday about their concerns. It happened at the Yes4Youth small business hub in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. Thabang Makgabo, owner of Fratelli Life Style, a furniture making and hire business, said: “Our business is too big for my yard. “We need space on which to work, expand and hire more youth.” Ntswaki Moilwa, owner of Ohsome Cakes, said: “Our businesses are held back by lack of expert labour. “We need skilled people to grow our businesses but can’t afford to hire them permanently.” Makhura said they were building and refurbishing industrial zones for small businesses, especially in manufacturing. “The Land Expropriation Bill will provide land for business,” said Makhura. Some entrepreneurs also spoke about how the politically connected got first preference when tenders were issued. Makhura said the province wanted to do away with the notion that one needed to be politically connected to get government tenders.
