FALLEN heroes were honoured and remembered by the Makapanstad community in the North West on Wednesday. It has been over 100 years since World War I, but to this community the legacy of African soldiers who fought in the war lives on. The annual Diturupa (troupes) Festival continues to bring the community together. Matla-A-Setshaba chairman Eddie Sedibe spoke to Daily Sun. “When our soldiers came back from the war, they went to local chief Makapan and showed him their outfits and danced for him,” he said. He said the event was held annually on 26 December in remembrance of the soldiers. “We are excited about it as it also keeps children off the streets,” he said. He said the youth must continue to honour the legacy. At the event, children showcased their talent with drum majorettes and traditional dancing. Bakgatla Mosetla local councillor Mokgadi Motsei said everything that was showcased at the event was beautiful. “I love the traditional dancers the most. I come every year to support the event.” North West education spokesman Freddy Sepeng said children taking part in the event were out of danger during the festive season. “Most of the pupils are benefiting as they are from poor backgrounds,” he said. Sefikantswe leader Nico Peu (31) said he couldn’t live without diturupa’s unique modern dancing. “We are happy and we welcome the youth at the event so they can avoid substance abuse and early pregnancies,” he said. Community member Mapule Molefi (37) said the event was important and it was good to see the kids’ talent put to good use. More than 5 000 people attended.
