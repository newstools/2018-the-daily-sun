SUNREADERS have been asked to help find missing Omphemetse Moagi. Omphemetse (30) from Rustenburg, North West, disappeared after leaving his home on 3 December. His family said they had searched everywhere for him, with no success. His granddad Reginald (71) said they had been having sleepless nights since Omphemetse went missing. He said they thought their troubles were over after burying Omphemetse’s mum in October. “I stayed with them after his mother’s funeral. A day after leaving, my grandson disappeared,” he said. According to Omphemetse’s father Michael, he left the house as if he was coming back. “Omphemetse said he was coming back but didn’t,” he said. Reginald said Omphemetse left in his white BMW. “We managed to get his car tracking company, and they located the car in Klerksdorp,” he said. Now the family fears the worst. “We pray that we find him unharmed,” he said. Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone confirmed that cops found an abandoned car in Klerksdorp. “A missing persons case has been opened for investigation. No arrest has been made so far,” he said. If you have any information, you may call Olebogeng on 081 771 1306, or the Daily Sun Tshwane office on 012 485 9251.
