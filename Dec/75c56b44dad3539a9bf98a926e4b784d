JACOBUS Marobane (60) is desperate to hold a loving woman in his arms again. But since last year they have been chased away by a tumour that started growing on the side of his head. It has grown so big it is now threatening to close one of his eyes. Jacobus, from Wattville in Ekurhuleni, wants doctors to cut the tumour off, so he can lead a normal life again. “Women run away from me because of this tumour. I am forced to stay indoors and it is weighing me down,” Jacobus said. He said it started as a small sore last year, but since then it has grown bigger and bigger. “I have been to Charlotte Maxeke Hospital asking doctors to remove it, but they took me to be scanned and then told me to go home,” he said. “I am afraid this ball will cover my whole face. I just want to live my life,” he said. Dr Albert Ngcobo said Jacobus needed to be thoroughly checked before being operated on, as some muscles might be damaged. The media liaison officer for Gauteng health, Patricia Mokoena, said an inquiry would be sent to the relevant hospital to investigate.
