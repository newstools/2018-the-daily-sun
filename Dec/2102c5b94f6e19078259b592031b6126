A NEWLY discovered blind worm that buries its head in the
sand has been named after Donald Trump. According to the Sun, the tiny, blind amphibian was
discovered earlier this year in Panama, South America. It was named Dermophis donaldtrumpi. Cofounder of the company EnviroBuild, Aidan Bell, said: "As
Dermophis donaldtrumpi is an amphibian, it is particularly susceptible to the
impacts of climate change and is therefore in danger of becoming extinct as a
direct result of its namesake's policies. "Burrowing his head underground helps Donald Trump
when avoiding scientific consensus on anthropomorphic climate change." Donald Trump often denies there is such a thing as climate
change. Once he claimed that the concept had been made up by the Chinese to try
to beat America in trade.
