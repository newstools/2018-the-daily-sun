EGYPTIAN authorities are on the warpath
after a Danish photographer posted a picture and video of himself poking a
woman on the ancient Great Pyramid. According to the Sun, Andreas Hvid
posted the x-rated image on his own website, and in a video on YouTube. It showed him and a female friend reaching
the top of the 140m high pyramid and looking out over the view of Cairo below. The video ends with a photo showing him
lying naked between the legs of his naked friend, as if poking. The video has since been removed. Egypt Today website quotes this from the
video description: "In late November 2018, a friend and I climbed the
Great Pyramid of Giza. "Fearing to be spotted by the many
guards, I did not film the several hours of sneaking around at the Giza
Plateau, which lead up to the climb." Hvid may be in deep trouble if the
authorities hunt him down. A religious and sexually conservative society, his
actions have been widely condemned as being a violation of public morality. It is also forbidden to climb to the top
of the pyramid. The whole site is out of bounds after 5pm and patrolled by
cops. Some, though, believe that the video is
a fake.
