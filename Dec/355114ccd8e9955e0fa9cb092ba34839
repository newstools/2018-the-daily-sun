MANY people didn’t make it home this weekend because of deadly accidents. Limpopo Transport MEC Makoma Makhurupetje visited the scene where a Toyota Fortuner possibly burst a tyre and collided head-on with an oncoming minibus. “There were 21 passengers in the minibus, and six children and four adults in the Fortuner. The minibus driver and two children died on the spot.” On Saturday, five people died 2km before the Kranskop tollgate when an allegedly speeding silver Toyota Yaris lost control and collided head on with a white Nissan 1400. According to ER24, a woman and young child, who were in one of the vehicles, died of their injuries. One passenger from the other vehicle was also declared dead on the scene. “Two women are in critical condition, while six other people sustained minor to moderate injuries,” said ER24. Two cops died in separate incidents. Spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said: “In the first incident on Saturday, at about 9pm, members of Atteridgeville police were conducting a roadblock on the R511 and R512 when a speeding vehicle failed to stop and struck a male constable. “He was declared dead on the scene. A man was arrested for culpable homicide and driving under the influence of alcohol.” In the second incident, a vehicle with two people crashed into a truck on the R21 near Olifantsfontein. It was later confirmed that one of the occupants declared dead at the scene was a 38-year old warrant officer stationed at national head office. Ten people died on the scene, while one died later in hospital, according to the department’s spokesman Thabo Sematle.
