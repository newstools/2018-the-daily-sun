KATHORUS Finest Movers are out to make a name for themselves and put Katlehong on the map. The dance group’s members are Xolo “X” Mncwango (17), Nhlanhla “Oros” Mthembu (18) and Sithembiso “Syrus” Shongwe (20). Sithembiso told SunBuzz they’ve been together since March and worked with local groups such as Enzo Dance Academy and Sakhile Cultural Group. “We’ve already achieved a lot since we started dancing together,” he said. “We’ve also been featured on music videos such as Iyavaya by L’vovo and Aw’jaive Ngishooteh by The Scientists, featuring SC Gorna,” said Sithembiso. The group has won school talent competitions and were in the finals of Ekurhuleni’s Got Talent. Xolo said: “What makes us unique is that we’re a true definition of versatility. We’re also goal driven.” He admitted that they’ve faced challenges. “Like other dancers on the rise, we do encounter challenges,” said Xolo. “One of the challenges is when other crews try to compete with us.” Nhlanhla said they were working on opening a dance studio.
