SOCIAL Development Minister Susan Shabangu, her deputy Henrietta Bogopane-Zulu, and management have wished grant beneficiaries and their families a merry Christmas and prosperous New Year. And, as a token of its caring nature, Sassa yesterday asked grant beneficiaries to be alert. “We ask that people not to give their Sassa card or PIN to anyone, even if they claim to be from Sassa or the Post Office,” said the agency. “Our officials will never ask for your PIN. It’s not allowed. “Call Sassa toll free on 0800 60 10 11 to report suspicious activity or to ask questions related to social grants. “Merry Christmas and a happy new year to all grant recipients and their loved ones.”
