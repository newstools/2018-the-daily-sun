ALL HELL broke loose in a train in Hong Kong on Wednesday
when a manâ€™s loud cough led to a violent brawl. According to Coconuts, a man was coughing loudly in the
crowded train without covering his mouth. He was coughing so loudly that one woman had covered her
ears with her hands. He coughed hard, straight into her face. Cops eventually arrived to calm things down.
