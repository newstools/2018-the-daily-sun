THE festive season is in full swing and people are already enjoying themselves. But on Sunday in Slovopark, near Coronationville west of Joburg, the fun got out of hand. There were complaints about noise in Slovopark squatter camp. The service at a congregation at a nearby church had to be stopped. The worshippers couldn’t hear themselves sing, nor could they hear the pastor preaching. Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendant Wayne Minnaar said officers responded swiftly to the complaint. “Two female officers responded and went to the area to investigate,” he said. But the noisemakers resisted arrest and fought with the officers, who called for backup. “They threw stones and petrol bombs at the officers,” he said. One of the petrol bombs landed in one of the patrol vehicles and a cop was slightly injured. The patrol cars, especially the windshields, were badly damaged. Minnaar said 15 people were arrested and a sound system and alcohol were seized. The traffic cops spokesman said people could have fun but show restraint. “They should have fun but must not disturb others,” he said. “Metro police won’t tolerate any bad behaviour such as playing loud music.” Minnaar said anyone who violated city by-laws would be dealt with harshly. He said the 15 suspects were due to appear in court on charges of malicious damage to property and assault.
