THE troubled Endumeni Local Municipality will be in the spotlight next week. This after President Cyril Ramaphosa assigned the special investigative unit to probe corruption in the municipality. Ramaphosa signed the proclamation last week and the unit is expected to visit the municipality after Christmas. KZN co-operative governance spokesman Senzo Mzila confirmed to Daily Sun on Wednesday that the presidency had informed MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube about the unit’s intervention. “Yes, we are aware of the investigation but can’t reveal exactly when the unit will go to Dundee,” said Mzila. “The unit doesn’t announce as and when they raid institutions.” The unit’s intervention follows a series of corruption reports involving senior municipal officials. The department produced four reports with recommendations to criminally charge those implicated. While former municipal manager Siyabonga Ntuli was preparing to implement the recommendations, he was dramatically suspended two weeks ago. After the suspension, Dube-Ncube announced last week that the municipality was being stripped of its administrative powers. Endumeni Speaker Lucky Khumalo said he was unable to comment as he was busy in a meeting.
