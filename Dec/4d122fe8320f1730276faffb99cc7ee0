a blocked drain has been pumping kak onto their streets for more than 10 years. Daily Sun published the plight of the residents of Nthabiseng Village, in Morebeng outside Polokwane in Limpopo, in October. At the time, the Capricon District Municipality promised to send technicians to attend to the matter, but residents said that still hadn’t happened. Resident Piet Motshosi said the municipality didn’t care about their health. “We’ve been reporting the matter for year, but our concerns continue to fall on deaf ears.” Piet said they couldn’t even walk the streets due to the smell. “Sometimes the sewage floods into our yards and that makes our lives more difficult. “We’re worried the stink might affect our health. We’ve been living like this for a long time and we feel it’s enough. “Maybe one has to die from the sewage so the matter can be attended to.” Another resident, Shadrack Molokomme, said the municipality had turned its back on them. “Our children pass by the sewage on their way to and from school, and that puts their lives in danger,” said Molokomme. Capricorn municipal spokesman Moffat Senyatsi said it was not true the municipality hadn’t attended to the matter. He said residents threw all sorts of waste into the drainage system, which restricted the movement of water in the pipes when it rained. “It’s the community itself that must take care of the environment and change their habits,” he said. “It can’t be accepted as normal that our technicians must unblock 15 mainholes a week in one area.”
