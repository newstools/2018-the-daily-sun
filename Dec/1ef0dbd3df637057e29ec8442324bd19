BIKERS have called on government to create awareness campaigns for other road users to recognise them. Welcome Matsane, president of Sunriders Motorcycle in Mpumalanga, was speaking during the memorial service of safety and security spokesman Joseph Mabuza. The service was held in Mbombela yesterday. Matsane said it hurt them when they buried one of their own because other road users don’t respect them. “Our safety as bikers is not guaranteed. When people see us, they see enemies. We need to teach our people, especially black people, because they still don’t understand this whole biking thing.” Mabuza died along the N4 road at Hectorspruit, near Komatipoort, on Sunday on his way from a work assignment. It’s believed a bakkie made a U-turn on the busy road, crashing into Mabuza, who died at the scene. The unknown driver fled. Simon Zwane of the Road Traffic Management Corporation said they would remain committed to saving lives in memory of Mabuza. Safety and Security MEC Pat Ngomane, who worked closely with Mabuza, said he would keep his legacy alive through the foundation they started together to educate young people. Mabuza will be buried on Saturday.
