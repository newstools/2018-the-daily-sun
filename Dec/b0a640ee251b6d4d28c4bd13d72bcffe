GUGULETHU was born 60 years ago when the apartheid government forced people to move to the area. But today the area in Cape Town is home to thousands of people. On Sunday, the organising team of the Gugulethu 60th Anniversary Celebrations brought celebrities Somizi Mhlongo, Unathi Msengana and Bulelwa Basse to the Gugulethu Fashion show. “It’s a significant day for the people of Gugulethu,” project director Phumzile Nteyi said. “We started the celebrations in January, and we’ve had different programmes for every month. “We thought we’d use the whole year because this is the first time that we’re celebrating Gugulethu.” Phumzile said they wanted all the sectors of the community to be involved. “Our programmes targeted the youth, women, the elderly and other sectors of the community. “Today we wanted to show Gugulethu fashion businesses to Mzansi. Today we say let it happen in our kasi!” Bulelwa was MC. She told residents to support each other. “I see beautiful clothes at the stalls over there. “We need each other to grow,” she said. Somizi thanked the organisers and Gugulethu people. “This is a kasi lamakasi. Thank you for celebrating it,” said Somizi. Unathi left people asking for more when she sang Sonini. Madala Albert Booi (73) said: “This township was formed when people were being kicked out of their places because of apartheid. “My family was one of the people who came here. “I’m happy that I’ve seen this day when this kasi is being celebrated.”
