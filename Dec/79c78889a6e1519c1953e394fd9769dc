With thousands of motorists expected to travel between Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Mozambique, traffic on the N4 toll route was expected to peak starting this coming weekend and lasting until the first week of January. Spokeswoman Solange Soares Nicholson said on these days, as well as throughout the festive season,  their roadside assistance units, patrol teams and 24-hour help desk would be on full alertin both South Africa and Mozambique in a bid to keep the road as safe as possible, and to attend to emergencies. She said they would assist through the provision of several logistical requirements and with the distribution of traffic control information flyers to motorists. “Road users travelling between South Africa and Mozambique are advised that the Lebombo and Ressano Garcia border posts will be operational 24 hours from 13 December to 8 January. “All construction on the N4 toll route will be on hold during the construction sector’s annual leave period, which is scheduled from 14 December 2018 to 6 January next year,” she said. The Department of Community Safety also raised concerns about a road crash in which six people were killed on the D812 Road in Kabokweni on Sunday. Spokesman for the department Moeti Mmusi said the bakkie in which the men were travelling reportedly got stuck on the road and a sedan stopped to help.
