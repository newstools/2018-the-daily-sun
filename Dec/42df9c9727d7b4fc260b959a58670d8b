KING Madzikane II and Princess Khusela tied the knot on Saturday. The Bhaca king and Thembu princess were married in a royal ceremony at Elundzini Great Place in Ncunteni Village, KwaBhaca. The princess is President Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokeswoman. The couple, who have known each other for three years, met during a meeting at a B&B in town. The king said after the meeting, he invited her and others to his home. “She was wearing pants, so I offered her a cloth,” he said. “She had no idea that the cloth was a proposal. “And in her accepting it, she was accepting my proposal. “From that day on we have never looked back. “There are a lot of things that led to this day, but these will be told some other time.” A friend close of the couple said ever since that meeting, Khusela has not been the same. “We feared she might not stand for it because her groom is a traditional man and she is a modern woman. “But so far she has been able to handle both worlds,” said the friend. Princess Khusela was described as a caring, loving and humble woman. The couple have been married for two years and had been waiting for the right moment on which to have a traditional wedding.
