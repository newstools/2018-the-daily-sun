ABOUT 500 residents of Walmer Gqebera in Port Elizabeth were given title deeds recently! Madala Toni Dyantjies (89), one of the recipients, told Daily Sun: “I’ve been waiting for this day since 2015 when I moved into this RDP. “When I heard someone saying on a loud hailer that today we’d be getting our title deeds, I was very excited. “I’m happy. I finally own a house. This will bring back my dignity and secure my family’s future.” Andile Mfunda, a member of the mayoral committee for human settlements, said: “Today I’m happy because we’re changing the lives of 500 people. This is part of our programme of ensuring that our people live a better life. “The area has a huge problem when it comes to human settlement. “But today we’re bringing service delivery at its best.” But he said the metro still had a long way to go. “We’re in the process of meeting the MEC and human settlements minister to discuss budget issues. We have a backlog of 84 units. Mfunda advised people who were still on the housing waiting list not to lose hope. “The current administration has taken a decision to speed up services. “We’re also talking to the provincial and national human settlements departments to fast track housing delivery.”
