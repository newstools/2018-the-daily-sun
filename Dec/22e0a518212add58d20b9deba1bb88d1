THERE’s drama each time the gogos go to the clinic. They either fight with staff over their medicine or are turned away. Now the gatvol gogos have decided enough is enough! On Wednesday, they protested in front of the Phillip Moyo Clinic in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, complaining about poor service. “It’s either we’re turned away or our medicine is not there. This is too much,” said gogo Elizabeth Masipha. The gogos were joined by residents and EFF members during their protest. The gogos also complained about the bad treatment they received from the clinic. One gogo told Daily Sun she had once witnessed patients dying because they were not getting urgent attention. “They don’t care because most of them use private doctors. “We don’t have money to pay doctors and we’re stuck with bad treatment from that clinic.” Sibongile Ngwenya, who is blind, complained about unfriendly nurses who work at the clinic. “They can see that I’m blind but chase my son outside,” she said. “I have to struggle alone as there will be no one guiding me.” Residents said they were not going to turn a blind eye as the elderly and sick were ill-treated by clinic staff. The residents and gogos handed over a memorandum to Gauteng heath officials, who promised to respond within 14 days. “If their attitude doesn’t change, they will definitely feel our anger,” warned the protesters.
