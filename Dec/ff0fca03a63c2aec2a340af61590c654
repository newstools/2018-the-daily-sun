EXAMS are over, summertime’s just round the corner, and matrics probably feel like young stallions finally let loose from the stable. But Limpopo Education MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe has warned pupils about the cost to their future if they overindulge. He said matrics should instead use the time to reflect on their academic journey and plot a way forward properly. He urged parents to discourage kids from going to wild pens-down parties. “Parents should know the whereabouts of their children at all times. “Various stakeholders, especially community members and leaders, are also requested to play a parental role. “We want our kids to wait for the results of their hard work. “We want them to know that part of growing up includes taking responsible decisions of self-restraint so that they nurture themselves into future leaders. “We want the results to find every pupil in a good state of mind and health.” Katjepe said scripts will be marked starting early December until 14 December at 22 centres across the province.
