UNIVERSITY of Western Cape Ladies FC have sent a strong message in their Sasol National Championship at Galeshewe Stadium in Kimberley yesterday. UWC dismantled hapless reigning champions Bloemfontein Celtic 3-0 in the opening match of the competition yesterday. After winning the title back-to-back in 2016 and last year, a lot was expected from Celtic Ladies but judging from the first match, the Free Staters don’t seem like a team capable of defending their title this year. Celtic coach Edwin Lisene admitted that it would be tough for them to find their mojo after losing the first match of the tournament. They have also lost some key players, including last season’s captain Boitumelo Rabale, who is now playing in the USA for Lewis and Clark Community College. “I don’t have players,” he said. “We came to this tournament with only 16 players and we have been forced to use some tired players (Bambanani Mbane, Melinda Kgadiete and Kgaelebane Mohlakoana) who previously played for Banyana Banyana in the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations in Ghana,” said Lisene. “We still have another game to play. We won’t throw in the towel just yet. In football anything can happen. We just need to pick ourselves up for the next match.” Celtic’s next game is tomorrow when they face Coal City Wizards at the same venue (1pm). Another defeat will see them bow out of the tournament. Khanya Xesi, UWC’s goal-scorer who was part of Banyana’s Cosafa squad says they are destined for great things. Xesi said: “This is the start we wanted. I believe we have set the tone for the tournament. We’ll remain focused and see how far we go.” Group A comprises Golden Ladies, Thunderbirds and TUT Ladies. Group B consists of Richmond Ladies, Durban Ladies and First Touch Academy. Group C features Bloem Celtic, UWC and City Coal Wizards. The final is scheduled to be played on Sunday.
