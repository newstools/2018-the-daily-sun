ZODWA IS planning to retire from the limelight soon. The bold entertainer wants to become a farmer! BUT IT’S SAD NEWS FOR THE BUM LOVERS OF MZANSI. At the end of next year she’ll hang up her tiny dresses to become a farmer and the best known backside in Mzansi will become a distant memory with faded Daily Sun pictures posted on fridges and headboards. “I’ve chosen farming because it’s a simple business. I’m not educated,” she said. Zodwa, whose real name is Zodwa Libram, said she has bought land in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. “I’ll have chickens, cattle and sheep on my farm,” she said. “I don’t want to see my money sitting in my account doing nothing. I want it to move around.” Mzansi’s most energetic and ambitious dancer said she’s full of ideas. She said women should embrace their bodies and know how to have fun in a responsible way and get involved in businesses that can help them grow their income. Zodwa said she wanted to own and rent out flats to students. The SunTeam asked her if she had any regrets about the way she dances. “I’ve been dancing for three years and I don’t regret anything,” she said. “I’m a strong woman. I’m unbreakable. I’m a fighter who always aims higher.” She said when she starts farming other people will benefit beecause she wil create jobs. Zodwa said she will retire in 2020. “I was supposed to retire this year, but I’m already booked for next year and I will wait for a year before I stop,” she said.
