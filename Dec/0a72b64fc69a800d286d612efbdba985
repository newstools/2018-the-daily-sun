COPS stopped two bogus officials in their tracks after they allegedly took tjotjo from undocumented foreigners. They were bust on Tuesday for impersonating immigration officials. “We arrested two suspects aged between 43 and 55 for impersonating immigration officers at Dragon City Mall. They were dressed in full immigration officer uniform,” said Captain Xoli Mbele. The men allegedly demanded passports, and if they didn’t find them foreigners had to pay to avoid being arrested and deported. They entered a 54-year-old Chinese man’s shop and asked for his passport and he showed it to them, but their greed wouldn’t let them leave empty-handed. “They asked for money and he gave them R20. He became suspicious and asked to see their appointment cards, which they failed to produce. “Police were contacted and the two suspects were apprehended and R1 040 was recovered.” Home Affairs spokesman David Hlabane told Daily Sun: “The department is aware of the matter and will provide the necessary assistance to the police.”
