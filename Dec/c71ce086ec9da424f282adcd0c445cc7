A COUPLE with a passion for a spicy sex life hooked up
for a foursome with another couple on their honeymoon. According to the Sun, Lee Blackley (31) and Terri
Blackley (27) from Britain tied the knot in May after three years of dating. Even when they were dating, both of them were openly and
proudly “swingers”, enjoying having sex with other people. Lee, who works in manufacturing, told the Sun: “Before we
started, we thought that swingers were just old people who had massive orgies. “But the truth is there are a lot of young people who are
swingers, which a lot of people don’t realise. “There’s a lot of stigma towards it but there shouldn’t
be. "At the end of the day, it’s something that takes
place between consenting adults behind closed doors. What’s the problem?” Before their marriage, they would get together at least
once a month with a bisexual woman for a threesome, as well as having foursomes
occasionally. They always use condoms and prefer not to swing at their
own home, but go to the other people’s houses or a hotel. They also never kiss these other lovers – only each
other. It made sense to continue with their unconventional sex
life after tying the knot, too. They went to Spain earlier this year for their honeymoon. Terri said: "We were on our honeymoon and found
another couple." "We talked a bit online and met them on the last
night of our honeymoon. We thought ‘let’s just do it’." Lee said their honeymoon sex fest felt like a blessing to
their new marriage, making the bond between them even stronger.
