THE Premier Soccer League’s chief operations officer (COO), Ronnie Schloss, has corroborated SunSport’s sources that Kaizer Chiefs played Golden Arrows in the Absa Premiership under protest at the weekend. The PSL head honcho confirmed that the league match was played under protest and the matter has now been referred to their prosecutor Nande Becker for decision. SunSport understands that Chiefs have lodged a protest before the game on Saturday which they lost 2-1 at Kwamashu’s Princess Magogo Stadium, citing the unplayable pitch. Now Becker is tasked into looking if Chiefs have a tangible case or not. Princess Magogo Stadium was in a state of atrocity following an event that took place at the venue few days before the game, and it was left with lots of sand patches showing all over the pitch. The fact that the game ended up taking place – Chiefs, Arrows, referee Eketseng Setloboho and match commissioner Stan Swart – all agreed that match must continue, something that might work against Amakhosi in the outcome. Explains Schloss: “If there’s protest, it’ll be handed over to our prosecutor and he’ll decide accordingly. “It is not the club’s decision whether it’s acceptable or not, it rests solely on the referee and match commissioner. In this case, it seems they (Chiefs) did lodge the protest, they played and the referee accepted that it was playable.’’ Pressed for further comment if the game could be replayed, the veteran administrator replied: “That is up to the prosecutor, isn’t it? I can’t comment on that. “They (Chiefs) have lodged the protest and it was handed over to the prosecutor. On when the prosecutor is likely to make the decision, I can’t tell.’’ With the festive season fast approaching, Princess Magogo Stadium is apparently fully booked until January for the local festivals. Arrows’ next home match is against fellow KZN side Maritzburg United on 6 January.
