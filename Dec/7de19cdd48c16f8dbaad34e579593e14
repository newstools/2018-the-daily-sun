Primary school pupils at UK schools will now be told ‘boys can have periods too’ in new sex education guidance. The advice to teachers was approved by Brighton Council in a bid to tackle stigma surrounding menstruation, this is according to a report by The Sun. The report states: "Trans boys and men and non-binary people may have periods", adding "menstruation must be inclusive of 'all genders'." It also orders that "bins for used period products are provided in all toilets" for children and that trans pupils and students should be provided with additional support from a school nurse if needed. The council said it was also "important for all genders to be able to learn and talk about menstruation together". A council spokesman told the Sun Online: “We believe that it’s important for all genders to be able to learn and talk about menstruation together. We recommend including boys in our lessons on periods and opportunities for girls to discuss issues in more detail if needed. They added: "We are working to reduce period poverty. By encouraging effective education on menstruation and puberty we hope to reduce stigma and ensure no child or young person feels shame in asking for period products inside or outside of school if they need them. "Our approach recognises the fact that some people who have periods are trans or non-binary.” In 2016, the £12,000 a year public school Brighton College was thought to be the first to change its uniform policy so that transgender pupils could wear what they like. But Tory MP David Davies told the Mail On Sunday it was "insanity" for teachers to be explaining the concept of transgender boys having periods to eight-year-olds. He said: "Learning about periods is already a difficult subject for children that age, so to throw in the idea girls who believe they are boys also have periods will leave them completely confused."
