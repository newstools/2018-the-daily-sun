ZITHOBENI residents have had enough of crime! After a woman’s body was found in the bushes on Sunday, people in the kasi near Bronkhorstspruit, east of Tshwane, accused cops of not doing enough to prevent crime. A meeting was held after the shocking discovery and the community decided to march to the cop shop. On Monday morning they woke up early to stop people from leaving the kasi. Taxi drivers joined the march as they had no passengers to take to work. Holding placards and singing struggle songs, residents marched to the cop shop. Resident Phephelaphi Ntuli (30) said the kasi was becoming too dangerous for women. She said passages and bushes were all traps. “It is not normal for women to live in fear. “I want to walk at night and arrive home safely, but this cannot happen here. “A woman who is alone in the dark is a target.” She said thugs were comfortable in Zithobeni. “They have doubled in number and are in paradise because the police do not fight them. They commit crime with arrogance because they know there won’t be any consequences.” Mpho Malefo said they had no choice but to take to the streets. “It seems the police do not get the message when one talks to them. ‘We want to see police visibility and they should update us on the arrests they make,” he said. Bronkhorstspruit police spokeswoman Munyadziwa Phungo said the cops were busy investigating a case of murder. “We have not yet made any arrests but are busy with investigations,” she said. Phungo said the march was peaceful and there were no reports made of public disorder.
