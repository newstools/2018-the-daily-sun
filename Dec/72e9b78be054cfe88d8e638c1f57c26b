THE three Mabuta siblings said their dad left them the house, but they might be out on the streets soon. According to municipal records, Douglas Mabuta – the father of Nomvuyo (38), Raymond (42) and Mzimkhulu (36) – owned the house which was left to him by his parents in 1992. When Douglas died in 2014, his sisters Nozipho Tshetlhe (61) Nocawe Zoko (77) and brother Mphikeleli Mabuda (67) claimed ownership of the house. It now belongs to Ntombizodwa Mabuta (37), a niece of Douglas’ siblings. When the three children went to the Matlosana Municipality they found Ntombizodwa to be the owner. Said Nomvuyo: “We can’t be removed from the house without a court order. The municipality was wrong to change ownership of the house.” Ntombizodwa would not speak about the house over the phone. Peter Phala of the Matlosana municipality said: showed the SunTeamthree identical affidavits where Douglas’ siblings handed over the house to Ntombizodwa.“Correct procedures had been followed. The The dependants of Mr Mabuta gave their rights to the person now registered. The process was legitimate.” Phala said the house was given to Douglas, and when he died it was re-allocated to Nocawe. He said the three occupants need to be advised because the house was allocated to Nocawe. He relies on the affidavits of the aunts and the uncle who live elsewhere. Phala said the municipality will address the matter with the means at its disposal.
