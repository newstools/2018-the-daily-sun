In the midst of all of the Global Citizen hype, you might have missed Usher’s explanation as to why he felt that working with Black Coffee for the concert was important. The global R&B star said that a collaboration with our pride and joy, Nkosinathi ‘Black Coffee’ Maphumulo, just felt right. “Out of all of the times that I’ve come, I wanted to do something authentic for this region. And I felt like Nathi, Black Coffee is that,” he said. Usher was talking to our other pride and joy, Trevor Noah on his Daily Show: Self-Deportation special shot in South Africa. “Out of all of the African performers who will be a part of this collaborative effort (Global Citizen), I felt like I wanted him to be a part of this amazing moment. And it really was set with the intention of not only celebrating what we’re doing with Global Citizen, which is very elaborate, I felt like this was [an] opportunity to start something new,” he went on. He then revealed that he is working with Black Coffee for his forthcoming album. “We gonna work on music for the album but this will be an amazing kick off and the intention is really to set the spirit in the right direction,” he told Trevor.
