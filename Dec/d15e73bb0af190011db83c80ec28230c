WHEN the heavy rain came there were joyful screams, dancing and singing. Some people refused to leave the grandstand, while others looked for shelter. Then a young woman plunged to her death from the stand. Cops quickly kept everyone away and the show had to stop until everyone had come down. The tragedy happened at the Mahika Mahikeng Cultural Music Festival at Mmabatho Stadium in North West on Friday night. It was during Maftown Heights, where hip hop artists took to the stage as part of the cultural festival. It was a chaotic scene with paramedics, cops, curious and shocked fans running in different directions. They were either trying to help the woman or trying to find shelter. The woman was certified dead at the scene and her body was removed before the show could go on. North West cops are urging anyone who may know the girl or her family to come forward. Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said Mmabatho cops are investigating the incident. He said the woman has not yet been identified but was thought to be in her 20s. Mokgwabone also said the woman fell from the Mmabatho Stadium stand at about 1am. He said: “According to information available at this stage, she was immediately treated by a doctor and paramedics but sadly, was certified dead at the scene.” “Police urge anyone who can help in identifying the woman or in tracing her family to contact Colonel Olebogeng Moraka at 082 569 2334 or to contact Detective Warrant Officer Andries Moepeng at 082 455 4486,” Mokgwabone said.
