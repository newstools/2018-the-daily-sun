Idols SA winner Yanga Sobetwa received a standing ovation at the Festival of Lights in Cape Town on Sunday night. The 17-year-old from Delft in Cape Town thanked Capetonians for their support. “Thank you very much for voting for me. It is because of you that I became a winner. You stood in one voice as Capetonians despite race and voted for me. Thank you very much.” Soon after, the audiance worked themselves into a frenzy when she performed two songs, including Xa Bendingena Mama by Zahara. Addressing the crowd, Yanga said nothing could stand in the way of young people if they followed their dreams. “I had a dream and I went for it. When I entered Idols SA I was targeting in the top 10 and I asked God to strengthen me – and look what he has done for me! “I am saying to every teenager and youth out there that no matter what you are going through you can still make it,” she said. Speaking about Idols SA the journey, she said: “The journey was so exciting, I had tears of joy, tears of worry and tears of excitement – but most of all I made sure I had fun!” She said during the competition she was worried about singing I Will Always Love You, but she knew she wanted to sing it at some point in the show. “I had so much pressure, but it went way better than I expected. “Fortunately, people commended me for my bravery and for choosing a Whitney Houston song. “The journey was exciting,” Yanga said. “I have seen God’s hand in this competition.” Yanga told the SunTeam that after returning home from Joburg she had to jump straight into writing her exams.

Last week Yanga wrote her English papers 1 and 2 and life orientation, and did her music practicals.
