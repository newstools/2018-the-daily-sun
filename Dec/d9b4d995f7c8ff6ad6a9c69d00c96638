Singer Kelly Khumalo’s relationship with rapper Chad da Don has been the talk of the town ever since it started. However, the pair have managed to shrug off all the negativity surrounding their new relationship and continue to serve relationship goals on social media. While many are still not convinced, Chad da Don, whose real name is Donovan Chad Mansoor, has even introduced Kelly to his family who “adore” her. And now, they appear to have taken their relationship to the next level if their social media posts are anything to go by. The couple respectively posted a picture of both their hands with matching tattoos and each other's initials. The picture has already started racking up the comments from her fans who wasted little time in congratulating them.“I said yes,” Kelly captioned her picture while Chad wrote: “I asked, she said yes, Love you my queen.” I said YES #MeetTheMansoors♥?
