THE SA Under-20 national men’s team are proving to be a tough nut to crack at the ongoing Cosafa Youth Championships in Kitwe, Zambia. Amajita, the defending champions, marched into the final after they defeated Angola 1-0 in the semifinals. Coach Thabo Senong’s charges are the highest scoring team at the tournament with 10 goals in their three games so far, and they also boast a perfect defensive record. Amajita will face Zimbabwe in the final at the Nkana Stadium today (3:30pm) as they go in search of their second consecutive Cosafa title. While he is confident that his side will defend their title, Senong is expecting Zimbabwe to provide a tougher challenge after they upset hosts Zambia 2-1 to book their spot in the final. “Zimbabwe have had an excellent run in this tournament. They’ve brought a good team with good individuals, especially in attack,” Senong said. “We just have to respect them and plan well for them, analyse them thoroughly and come up with a game plan to achieve our objective. “When you play in the final, you want to win. We are teaching them that winning culture, so we will go back, prepare well and work very hard to ensure we win this match.” Amajita will look to the tournament’s top goalscorer Lyle Foster, who has banged in four goals in three games so far, to fire them to Cosafa glory. Senong believes his goal-scoring instinct is what sets the Monaco-bound Orlando Pirates marksman apart from other young strikers in the country. Said Senong: “He is hungry for goals which is something our strikers have been lacking in South Africa. “I can only wish him well going forward – hopefully he can continue to develop as a footballer. “He has been doing very well but credit must also go to the team environment because the other players are really working hard to create chances for him. “Naturally he is brave and always ready to take those chances when they come.”
