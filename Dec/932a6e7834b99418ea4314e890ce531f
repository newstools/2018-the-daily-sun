A nine-year-old boy has been left injured after a
wall of a house fell on him at Sedan village in the Greater Tzaneen. The incident occurred during a freak storm that
hit the area on Wednesday night. Mopani District Municipality spokesperson Witness
Tiva said several people were left stranded after their roof tops were blown
away. Two schools were also damaged. He said the Mopani District Municipality disaster
management team that was immediately deployed in the area managed to assess
eleven households overnight. "We have activated SASAA and cluster
departments so that the distribution of relief in a form of food parcels, tents
and other basic amenities can be distributed to the affected families," said
Tiva The Mopani District together with the Greater
Tzaneen Municipality will further assist with the provision of emergency
housing where there's a need. He also urges communities across the district to
be on high alert as several areas are prone to this kind of disaster. The District recently experienced similar
challenges in the Greater Giyani and Ba- Phalaborwa municipal areas.
