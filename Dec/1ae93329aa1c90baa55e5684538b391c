WHEN he was young he always dreamt of having his own business and being his own boss. Ketseletso Lepipikoe (28) from Ladybrand in Free State has now realised that dream. He started his business in 2011 and made T-shirts he sold at school. “It was difficult when I started. I had to buy paint and brushes. “I was in grade 8 and struggled to get money to buy the material,” said Ketseletso. He said he got a piece job and used the money he made to buy supplies. “I started my business again after matric and I have been operating for five years now. I also do wooden and cement sculptures, fabric printing, sign writing, graffiti and wire crafts,” he said. Ketseletso said he was working hard to make his business known in the province. “Business is slow, but I am pushing to make it work. I won’t give up on my dream,” he said. He said he looked forward to marketing his work all over Mzansi.
