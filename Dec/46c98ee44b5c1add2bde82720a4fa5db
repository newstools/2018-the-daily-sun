A MUM and dad woke up to instant horror when they realised
they had accidentally squeezed their four-week-old baby to death. According to the Sun, Keeley Makin and partner Nicky
Marsh usually put baby Archie to sleep in his own baby basket in their bedroom. But on 17 November, they let him sleep in the bed between
them after he’d had a night feed. The couple, who already have three other boys, woke up to
find Archie limp and unresponsive. Panicking, they called the paramedics but there was
nothing they could do for the child.Keeley and Nicky sobbed at the inquest last week. The inquest heard the pair were “perfect parents”. Archie was found to have suffered rib fractures thought
to have been caused by being squeezed between his parents. It was judged to be an accidental death. In an emotional statement, Keeley said: "Archie was
our beautiful little boy. He was our fourth child, we already have three boys. "Archie's death came as a horrible shock for the
whole family. We were all so excited for Archie to come along, his brothers
were amazing with him. "We did not get to see his first smile. Not a day
goes by where we don't think about our Archie. He will forever be in our
hearts." Coroner Alan Walsh said: "There are probably
hundreds of thousands of parents who may have infants sleeping in their bed
this evening. But every one of those parents potentially puts their child’s
life at risk. "One thing that can arise from Archie's tragic death
is an awareness. This is a risk that can be avoided and a death that can be
prevented. "You would never have imagined this would have
happened. You provided the perfect home, you were the perfect parents and I am
extremely sorry."
