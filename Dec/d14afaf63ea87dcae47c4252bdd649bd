THE community must work together to fight mashonisas! This call of action comes from Tebogo Tsotetsi, director of lotteries law and policy at the Department of Trade and Industry. Speaking at the National Education and Awareness Campaign on key legislation of the department at Makeleketla, Winburg in Free State on Friday, she said the community must work as a unit to stop mashonisas operating. Tsotetsi said the purpose of taking the campaign to Free State was to inform the local community about their rights. She said mashonisas were illegal and they did not apply the rules of the National Credit Act. “It is obvious that credit consumers are taken for granted and their rights are frequently abused by illegal credit providers,” she said. “People who borrow from mashonisas have no legal protection,” she said. Tsotetsi said mashonisas are known for being ruthless in an already brutal market. “We know we will never completely stop the illegal lending, but a change in legislation will make it easier to close them down.” Tsotetsi recommended that unregistered credit lenders must register as credit providers.
