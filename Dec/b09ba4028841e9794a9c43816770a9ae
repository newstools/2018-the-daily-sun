A 24-YEAR-old Mpumalanga mum is facing a charge of attempted murder after she allegedly threw her four-month-old baby out of a moving vehicle on Tuesday. The young mum was travelling with someone who gave her a lift near Highveld Mall in Witbank. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a bystander who saw the incident rushed to pick the baby up and took it for a medical check-up. “The baby was taken to Life Cosmos Hospital. He is in critical condition. We urge parents to take care of their children at all times,” Hlathi said. Witnesses who saw what happened said they were still shocked. They stopped the car and asked what was happening: “We still do not know what led to the incident, because when we asked her, she did not say anything. “This is the first time we have seen something like this. We hope the baby gets well soon and that the mother faces the law because she had intentions of killing the baby. What she did wasvery shocking. She must be punished accordingly,” said one resident. The suspect will make her first court appearance soon in the Witbank Magistrates Court.
