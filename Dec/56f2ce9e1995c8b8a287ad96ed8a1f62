DURING apartheid they shared their drinking water with livestock. And now, more than 20 years later, nothing has changed. Zethembe Mkhize (26), who lives in Nkwezela near Bulwer in KZN, said residents felt neglected. “We have never tasted clean water like other wards in the Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma area. “We have been drinking the water from the streams with the livestock and we’re still sharing it with them. I think Dr Dlamini-Zuma must be ashamed we are experiencing these problems,” said Zethembe. She said they’ve been complaining about the matter to officials but it seems no one cares about them. DA councillor Victor Phoswa, who is also from the area, said water was a serious problem. He said he has been raising the problem in the municipality, but other than promises it will be taken care of soon, nothing has been done. “When ANC leaders proposed to name this municipality after Dr Dlamini-Zuma we did not support it because we knew her name would be dragged through the mud.” “It is not acceptable after years of democracy there are areas such as ward 9, where people still share basic facilities with animals.” Municipal manager Nkosiyezwe Vezi said his municipality was working hard to address the water problems. He said he was aware there were areas where residents still had to walk long distances to get water.
