COMPUTERS with classified information were damaged when the roof of the Limpopo Hawks’ office was blown away by a strong wind on Monday. Officers said they could have been seriously injured if the accident had not happened on a public holiday. Hawks head Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya said the condition of the crumbling building was reported to the public works department in April. Lebeya said although some parts of the building were identified as needing serious attention, nothing was done. He said although the computers were damaged, he believed the dockets were not affected. Lebeya said while the Hawks wanted to create an environment where officers were not in danger, moving to a new building would create problems. “The Hawks need an office where they can interview witnesses, write dockets and update information on their computers.” Limpopo public works spokesman Joshua Kwapa said his department provided the building to the Hawks, but the owner was responsible for maintaining it. The owner of the building said he always attended to his tenants’ complaints. “If the building wasn’t right, why did they sign a lease agreement? I didn’t force them to sign it,” he said. “Fortunately, there were no casualties. “The roof was perfect before the storm and we’re working on repairing the damage.” He said he offered the Hawks another office to work from.
