SAFA Joburg president Phil Mogodi has hailed the ever-growing Kasi festive football tournaments currently in full swing in Gauteng. Among the popular tourneys is the month-long Discovery Challenge tournament consisting of 64 senior men’s teams, 48 Under-17 and eight women’s teams at Nike Sports Centre in Soweto. Also taking place in Soweto are the KwaMahlobo Games currently under way in Meadowlands. The LaLiga backed tournament has 40 men and four women’s teams and is staged under the auspices Safa Johannesburg. “There are several games which take place during the festive season but I am proud to say the Discovery and KwaMahlobo Games are the most popular of them all by far,” said Mogodi. “Thousands and thousands of people flock to these games during the festive season and both have been growing from strength to strength by the year.” Mogodi has also paid tribute to the Soweto community for supporting the tournaments, saying such tournaments help keep youths away from the streets and crime. “There are opportunities created within the communities and in the past few years we have also seen crime scaling down as a result of the youth being kept busy by these Games,” Mogodi explained. “There are also employment opportunities created by these games on top of them giving the youth opportunities to showcase their football talent. “I also want to take this opportunity to thank Discovery and LaLiga for joining hands with the community and drive these games.” The finals of the Discovery Games are on Saturday December 29 while the KwaMahlobo Games will end on 5 January in the New Year.
