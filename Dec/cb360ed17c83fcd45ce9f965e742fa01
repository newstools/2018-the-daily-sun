THE Mpumalanga Department of Health has launched Operation Phakamela Impilo, a campaign aimed at providing comprehensive health care services and screenings to taxi drivers, hawkers and commuters. The campaign was launched at the Nelspruit taxi rank on Tuesday by MEC Sasekani Manzini and health officials. Manzini said the department realised that most taxi drivers and hawkers could not find the time to go and visit clinics for health check-ups. “We have therefore brought mobile clinics to provide the necessary health services they need. “This is not a once-off programme. We will continue to bring the same services every month,” she said. Manzini also assured communities that the department had put plans in place to ensure health services continued uninterrupted over the festive season. Santaco chairman Moses Gama said the campaign would make a big difference in the lives of taxi drivers and hawkers. Esther Shirimbi (51) a hawker, said she was happy that the department brought services closer to them.
