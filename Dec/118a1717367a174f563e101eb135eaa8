THE fight between North West health department head Dr Thabo Lekalakala and the government continues. He’s accused of helping Gupta-owned company Mediosa get a department contract and is on special leave. He challenged the decision to place him on special leave at the Labour Court, and on Thursday the court ordered that he be reinstated with immediate effect. He returned to work on Friday. But the premier’s office plans to challenge the court ruling. North West premier Job Mokgoro’s spokesman Vuyisile Ngesi said: “The North West government was surprised to learn on Thursday evening that Lekalakala obtained a court order that he should be reinstated. “It’s clear that he applied to the Labour Court on an urgent basis and his application was unopposed. “We were not aware of this and wanted to establish who was served with the court papers.” Lekalakala was suspended by former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo. He was placed on special leave 60 days later by Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi. The bargaining council decided the special leave was unfair, and lifted it and paid him his suspended salary. Mokgoro put him on precautionary suspension on 21 November. His office said it would have opposed the court application, had it been made aware of it.
