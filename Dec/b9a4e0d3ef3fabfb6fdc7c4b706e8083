RESIDENTS wanted to enjoy the wedding at all costs. Cars had to be moved out of the way so the bride and groom could dance in the streets. But one neighbour put spikes in front of his yard to prevent people from parking there. The guests refused to let the spikes get in their way, so they removed them while the home owner was at a funeral. When Cornelius Maswanganyi returned to his in home in section BB of Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, he found the spikes, which cost him R3 000 to buy and install, thrown over his fence. The angry 64-year-old rushed to the police to open a case. “I don’t understand why a neighbour wouldn’t inform me or ask for my permission before removing the spikes,” he said. “I spent a lot on the spikes and I will pursue civil action to get my money back,” Maswanganyi said. He said he installed the spikes because criminals used to park in front of his house. “I would wake up to find cars parked outside. “I had no choice but to create a barrier,” he said. The bride and groom’s relatives refused to comment. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Maluleka said a case of malicious damage to property was opened. No arrests have been made yet.
