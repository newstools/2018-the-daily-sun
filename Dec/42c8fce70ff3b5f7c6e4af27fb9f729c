SOLLY Mohaule (36) from Sgodi Phola in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, claims the government promised to build him an RDP house. But years later he is still living in a shack. “I used to live in a mud house, but it was destroyed by a hailstorm in 2016. “I went to my councillor and I was placed in a tent. “Members of the community eventually raised funds and helped me build a one-roomed house,” he said. Solly claimed his house was destroyed by the department of human settlements after officials promised to build him an RDP at the same site. “But they just hired someone to destroy the house and never came back.” Better Residents Association PR councillor Sidney Khoza said Solly had been asking for assistance for a long time. “My biggest concern is that the housing budget had already been allocated, so I’m wondering what happened to the money. The least they could do is find a job for him so he can build his own house,” said Khoza. Human settlements spokesman Freddy Ngobe said Solly’s application was not approved because he was listed as a dependant by another applicant who got a house. “The system would not allow the construction of a house under his name,” said Ngobe. “He is advised to visit the municipality or department to address this technicality so he can reapply. “The department will visit him to verify whether his ID was used in the successful application.”
