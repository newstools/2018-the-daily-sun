The cops in Mphephu outside Thohoyandou are searching for a group of suspects who attacked and killed three people. It is alleged that there was a fight that occurred at a beer hall in Ga-Mulelu village on Saturday in which a 22-year-old man was killed. Limpopo police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said that after this death, members of the community mobilised each other and started hunting down those who are accused of killing of the 22-year old. They found the three men and took them back to the murder scene. Ngoepe said the crowd toned them and burned all of them to death. The process of identifying the three deceased is still unfolding. Ngoepe said four cases of murder were opened for further police investigations. The suspects involved in this incident are still unknown and there is no arrest yet. Anyone with information which can assist in the arrest of the suspects involved in this matter, may contact the crime stop number 0860010111 or the crime Line SMS 32211 or the nearest Police Station. The Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service in Limpopo Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has condemned the recurring incidents of mob-attacks and killings that are still prevalent in some parts of the Province with the strongest terms. "Members of community are warned to refrain from taking the law into their own hands, "The Police must be given a space to deal with any criminal act without them resorting to violence which is totally uncalled for, " said Ledwaba.
