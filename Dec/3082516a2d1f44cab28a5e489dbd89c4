TSHWANE cops shared safety tips on Monday during a crime prevention and safety awareness campaign in the CBD. Police spokeswoman Captain Augustinah Selepe said: “More than 500 safety pamphlets were distributed on topics such as domestic violence, business and common robberies, half-price sales, theft out of motor vehicles, and theft of motor vehicles.” The campaign was organised by the Tshwane West cluster and Pretoria Central police’s communication and social crime prevention units, in partnership with NGO Kopano Manyano Centre. Selepe said Constable Thabang Nkhumise warned passersby to beware of bogus prophets, salespeople and doctors. Shoppers were also warned to take precautions when walking around town.
