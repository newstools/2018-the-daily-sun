THE Jansen tavern and home in Damonsville, North West, have been hit by fire. The family are now worried about the business they have been running since the 1990s. Some neighbours even missed work to help the family put out the fire last Wednesday morning. Gelino Jansen (21) said he was at home when the fire started. According to him, the electricity went off, and when it came back it came with a shot. “There were people in the tavern and I was sitting outside when someone called me, saying something was burning in the house,” he said. He said they called firefighters and tried to stop the fire, but there was no water in the area. “We had no choice but to just watch the house and tavern burn to ashes while firefighters were on their way,” he said. Gelino said everything in the house and tavern was already in ashes when the firefighters arrived. He said no one was injured, except his dog. Gelino’s dad Charles said the damage was worth R1 million. “I have lost over R100 000 of stock. Everything was in ashes,” he said. Shocked residents said what happened to the Jansen family was really sad. They said they would pray for them. Some said they did not know where they would enjoy the festive season. “Charles’ tavern was the only happening spot in the area, and now that it is burnt we will have a boring December,” said one of the residents. North West police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh said investigations were still continuing. “We can confirm there was a fire in the area and police attended the scene. An inquiry has been opened for investigation to determine whether it is arson or not.”
