PETER Mokgoko fears every knock on his door. The 73-year-old said his wife, Johanna Mokgoko (58), went missing last Monday. Not knowing his beloved Johanna’s fate has caused a lot of tension for the family. Johanna disappeared from George Mukhari Hospital in Tshwane after Peter took her there for a check-up. He said she was nowhere to be seen minutes after he went to get her pills. “I left her on the bench, and when I checked on her she was gone,” he said. Peter said he looked everywhere and even went to security to check the cameras. “The only time I could see her on the cameras was when we went into the hospital. “It seems as if she is still at the hospital,” he said. He said Johanna was diagnosed with dementia some years ago. “She went missing for a day before this, but we found her in time. A while ago she tried to run away, but we saw her before she could go far.” Peter said he was getting sick. “My wife’s family blame me for her disappearance, but I would not do anything to hurt her.” He said Johanna was last seen wearing a cream blouse and a black and white skirt. Captain Matthews Nkoadi urged people to help find her. “Anyone with information can call us on 012 797 8851 or 08600 10111,” Nkoadi said.
