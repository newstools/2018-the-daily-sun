AFTER winning the Varsity Football competition for the fifth time and getting crowned Gauteng Sasol League champions last month, Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) Ladies are determined to continue their dominance at the National Championship currently underway in Kimberley, Northern Cape. TUT may only be playing in the Sasol League National Championships for the first time but they are among the favourites to win this year’s title as reigning champions Bloemfontein Celtic Ladies struggle. Mamelodi Sundowns and JVW did not qualify for this year’s championships. Coach Tebogo Mokae’s charges started the tournament in fine form, brushing aside Eastern Cape representatives Thunder Birds 2-0 on Wednesday. On Thursday the continued with their displays when they came from a goal down to clinch a 2-1 victory over Golden Ladies to set a date with First Touch Academy in the semifinals of the tournament which will be on Friday (1:30pm) The experienced squad which include Elizabeth Mashilo, Hildah Magaia, Koketso Tlailane and Busisiwe Ndimeni has been producing five-star performance in the competition. Mokae has played down the favourites tag: “Our players were a bit nervous but the two substitutions I made had an impact, as the goals came from them. “The Varsity Football competition and National Champs are two very different competitions. We have won five Varsity Football titles but it’s our first time here. It shows that Sasol football is more competitive.” “But we came here to give it our best and get the result,” added Mokae. This year there would be new champions as two times champions Bloemfontein Celtic failed to make it into the semifinals. The second semifinal clash will be between University of Western Cape against Durban Ladies (3:45pm), Galeshewe Stadium, with the final scheduled for Sunday.
