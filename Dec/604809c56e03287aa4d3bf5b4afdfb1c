TWO men have been arrested for the murder of IFP member Sibuyiselo Dlamini (33). The Zululand District Municipality councillor was gunned down in Ulundi in May in what many suspect was a hit. He was active in the fight against water supply tender corruption. During Dlamini’s funeral, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said he was aware the killers were party members. He said Dlamini had given his daughter Sibuyiseliwe names of those who wanted him dead. Two men were bust on Saturday and appeared briefly in the Mahlabathini Magistrates Court on Monday. The matter was postponed to tomorrow for a bail application. One of the suspects is a bodyguard to former municipal boss Sipho Nkosi, who was fired earlier this year. The second suspect apparently was a close friend of the deceased. Last week, the task team investigating political killings raided Nkosi’s home and took him to KwaDukuza cop shop for questioning. He and his two bodyguards were bust, but he was released along with one bodyguard. The other was charged. There were unconfirmed reports that Zululand mayor Thulasizwe Buthelezi was also taken in for questioning. The mayor denied this.
