 IT’S all over between Amanda Sparrow
Large (46) and the ghost of a 300-year-old pirate named Jack she married
earlier this year. According to The Irish Sun, Jack is the
ghost of an 18th century Haitian pirate. He and Amanda had been
dating for two years before deciding to tie the knot in January. They did so in a legal ceremony on a
boat off the Irish coast in international waters. They were married by a shaman priest. A
shaman is a tribal healer who can act as a medium between the visible world and
the spirit world. Amanda said she’d had it with real life
men so decided to give a loving ghost a chance. She has previously made headlines for
giving tips on having “ghost sex”. She said: “Spiritual sex is all about
being able to feel the energy. It’s nothing to do with masturbation. “So although it can be tried from any
position, missionary is probably best to start with because it’s easier to feel
their weight and take it from there.” But now the good times are over with
Jack, although Amanda didn’t give details. In a Facebook post, she said: “So I feel
it’s time to let everyone know that my marriage is over. “I
will explain all in due course but for now all I want to say is be VERY careful
when dabbling in spirituality, it’s not something to mess with.” Amanda’s day job is working as an
impersonator of “Pirates of the Caribbean” character Jack Sparrow. She has had to work hard on her
appearance to pull it off, with replica tattoos, dreadlocks and gold teeth so she
can look identical to the character.
