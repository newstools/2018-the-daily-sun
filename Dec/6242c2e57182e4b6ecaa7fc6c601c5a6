IT’S no secret that media mogul Khanyi Dhlomo’s company Ndalo Media has been experiencing cash flow problems. Staff was reportedly not paid their November salaries and in a letter penned by Khanyi, she promised to pay them on December 20. But now according to Sowetan newspaper, the businesswoman has announced that Ndalo Media will shut its doors at the end of January. In an apparent voice recording given to Sowetan by a source, Khanyi confirms the staff’s worst nightmare – the shutting down of Ndalo Media. “Given just where we are and the various conversations we’ve had, I’ve decided to close down this company effective as of the 31st of January next year [2019],” Dhlomo was heard saying in an audio recording provided to Sowetan by a source. “Today is going to be the day one of notice, so this is the proposed notice of redundancy which each person in this company is going to get,” said Dhlomo referring to a document which was being handed to staff.“And what we’ll do is allow everyone 30 days which will take us to about the 17th of January to look at this, go through it. If you have thoughts and ideas about how this process could be handled you have the next 30 days or so to think about,” she told the staff. Khanyi’s problems are exacerbated by the fact that SAA did not renew its contract with Sawubona magazine, as the airline is also experiencing financial woes.
