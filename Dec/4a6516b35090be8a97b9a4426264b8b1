THOKOZILE Tsedoli has always been passionate about business, even when she worked at a butchery. The 26-year-old from Vukuzenzele kasi in Ladybrand opened a shisa nyama business after she was retrenched from the butchery. “I met one of my friends from Bloemfontein, who advised me to open a shisa nyama and sell fat cakes,” said Thokozile. “After I was retrenched, I took some of my savings and bought meat to braai and cake flour to make fat cakes. “At first business was very slow, but it picked up as time went by.” She said she had difficulty when it rained or there were strong winds. “By the grace of God and the support I got from my customers, I managed to buy a container. Business has been good since. “Now I sell food even when it is raining,” she said. Thokozile said she sells a plate of pap or rice with meat and salads for R40. “Business is good and my customers are always happy. “Sometimes the food is finished by noon. I have hired two women. “I plan to get a bigger place so that I can open a restaurant and employ more people,’ she told Daily Sun. “Unemployed women should start doing things for themselves. “They should not depend on their husbands for money. They can actually help them bring more income to the house. “I am happy with the money I make to provide for my family and pay my assistants.”
