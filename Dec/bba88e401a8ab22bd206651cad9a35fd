THESE young ones are all ready for next year. Kids from Leseding Day Care Centre on Paradys Experimental Farm, outside Bloemfontein, graduated in style on Sunday. They sang, danced and performed various activities in their new school uniform. Sonti Matlatsane, the new matron at the day care, said the event was a success even though they had to change the venue at the last minute. “We had to change the venue at the last minute, but things went well. “The kids and their parents had fun on the day,” Sonti told Daily Sun. The children entertained their parents with plays and dancing. They even paid tribute to the former matron, Selina Frans (61), who died in a car crash on 28 June. Nnuku Monoane (33) from Kagisanong, said her daughter Moleboheng Masia (5) was happy to say goodbye to preschool. “We had fun and enjoyed all the activities performed by the kids,” Nnuku said. “My daughter will be in grade R next year. “She is ready and excited about next year. “She has been attending day care since she was two,” she told the People’s Paper. She said the late Selina treated all the kids the same and children were always happy to see her. “Sonti is a good person and I think kids will love her.”
