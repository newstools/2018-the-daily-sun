How many people can honestly say that they not only discovered but pursued their passion at a very young age? Well, one of Mzansi’s favourite pastors, Khaya Mthethwa is one of those and he thanks God for the blessing. The singer, musical director and pastor has this week recalled preaching from the tender age of 14 in his Durban hometown of Umlazi. Growing up as a pastor’s kid, it is almost as if it was written in the stars for this multi-talented man of God. He recently shared a picture of himself during one of his first sermons at age 14, crediting God for the favour on his life. “The first sermon I ever preached, I was 14 years old and preached with tears in my eyes John 3 Jesus turning water into wine,” he captioned the photo. Khaya also told fans that it is all through the power of purpose that he was able to do this from such a young age. The Idols SA season eight winner (the first black winner) is, of course, in good spirits this week, having also finally confirmed that his wife, former Miss SA, Ntandoyenkosi Kunene-Mthethwa is carrying their first child.
