Painter Ayanda Mabulu has never shied away from controversy. His recent artwork has ruffled feathers. Mabulu was arrested last week Wednesday (12 December) in Joburg after he unveiled his new painting in front of the Joburg Stock Exchange, stating, "blame it on the boers". The artwork was hung up, with pig heads placed at the bottom of it and money strewn on the floor. Notes were also in the mouths of the pigs. A scuffle ensued between Mabuluâ€™s team and the police, in which his painting was also confiscated. He was released a few hours later. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mabulu said that his painting is a severe criticism of the state looting that has been exposed recently. He also shared with the SunTeam the symbolism behind the painting. Speaking to News24 outside teh JSE, on the day of his arrest, Mabulu said "I am here to represent and speak on behalf of the highly undermined black people who are constantly being robbed by white monopoly capital.""It's a call to say if a black man stole a packet of beans, he would have been arrested in public, but people like Markus Jooste, who robbed in public, it is okay for them to not to be arrested. Why? What are we waiting for? No, things should change," he added.
