AFTER competing in the Miss Hazyview pageant in the past two years, Khensani Bonga has finally won the title. The 22-year-old from Acornhoek, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, said she never gave up on her dream even though there were challenges along the way. The event, which was organised by Admire Billy Malubana Foundation, was held at Hosanna Community Church on Friday. Khensani told Daily Sun: “I was once disqualified before the finals of the pageant because I didn’t attend photoshoots, but I thank God for this opportunity. “When they announced my name, I froze. I thought I was dreaming.” Khensani, who’s studying marketing management at Capricorn TVET College, said she started modelling in 2015 while in matric at Mahashe Secondary School. “Since winning, I’ve started with a clothes giveaway for the needy. “I’m pleading with people to give away clothes they haven’t worn in a long time. “I’ll travel to various areas to collect them so we can lend a helping hand.”
