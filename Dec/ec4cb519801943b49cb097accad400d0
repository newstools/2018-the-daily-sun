COPS in Cape Town are investigating yet another arson attack on a MyCiti bus. A bus driver and a commuter survived the petrol bomb attack in Woodstock on Monday night. According to fire and rescue spokesman Theo Layne, the driver sustained serious injuries, while the passenger was not seriously injured. They were transported to hospital. Cops told Daily Sun yesterday that the bus was attacked by two men, but they ran away. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of malicious damage to property was opened at the Woodstock cop shop. Residents in the area said they only saw smoke and huge flames on the road. “At first we did not know it was a MyCiti bus because the smoke was too dense. When the firefighters arrived, that is when we realised it was a MyCiti bus on fire,” said Marriam Hendricks, who lives near the scene. Attacks on the buses have increased recently after 80 drivers were fired for taking part in an unprotected strike. Leah Eckles from Kidrogen, one of several companies contracted to help run the bus service, said last month that the drivers were dismissed because of serious unacceptable behaviour, which constitutes gross misconduct. A few bus drivers are still seen outside the City of Cape Town’s offices singing and dancing as they still hope to retain their jobs. Three weeks ago another bus driver survived an arson attack in Omuramba Street in Milnerton.
