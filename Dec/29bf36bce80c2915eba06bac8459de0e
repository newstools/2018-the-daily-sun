THE family of a girl who was allegedly killed by her boyfriend have urged residents to oppose bail for him. Mmeli Zungu (29) will appear in the Umlazi Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Babalwa Mbhele (15) was buried on Saturday at her home village of Gcotsheni outside Mandeni, north of KwaZulu-Natal. Speaking at the funeral, her sister Silindile Mbhele (30) urged mourners to come out in their numbers to oppose bail. She told mourners that courts considered public view before deciding whether to release a suspect on bail or not. “We thank you for the support you have given us. We urge you to come with us again to pack the court when the suspect appears. We call on everyone, especially women, to picket outside the court,” said Silindile. She said her sister was three months pregnant when she was killed on the first day of 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children. Babalwa was found stabbed dead at her boyfriend’s shack in A section, Umlazi. She was found with three stab wounds in her body. Her boyfriend was attacked by angry residents and was rushed to hospital. It is believed he killed her after she told him she was pregnant. Zungu briefly appeared in the Umlazi Magistrates Court last week for alleged murder and the matter was postponed to Wednesday for a bail hearing.
