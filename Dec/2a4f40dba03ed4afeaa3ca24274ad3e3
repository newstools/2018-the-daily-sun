WHILE many are enjoying their holidays, the Makondo family is hoping to survive long enough to see 2019. The family from Klipgat in Tshwane lives in a house that is falling apart. They worry that bad weather might destroy it and leave them homeless –or even dead! George Makondo (29) said his two brothers and their mum are mentally ill and unemployed. He’s the only one who’s healthy. Three months ago, rain destroyed half the house. “The roof collapsed and walls fell over. We had to use zinc sheeting and boards to cover the holes. “We survive on my piece jobs. We don’t have money to build a proper house.” George’s mother Victoria (68) said they don’t have water or electricity and have nowhere to go. “Rain water leaks into my room. I just sit and watch helplessly until it stops. “This is not a healthy place for us because we’re chronic illness patients.” She appealed for help. “We don’t know where to go for help or what to do,” she said. They have been living in their three-roomed house for 39 years. Ward 36 councillor France Masemola promised Daily Sun he would visit the family and check up on them. Social development representatives would also be sent to help them with social grants. “We will investigate and take it from there.”
