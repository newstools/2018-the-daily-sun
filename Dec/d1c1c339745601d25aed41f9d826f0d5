FOUR suspects who are in custody for the murder of Belinda Tshayisa (35) will have to wait for a week before they can apply for bail. The accused, who include father and son Luthando and Luyanda Tshayisa, Sikelela Madadiyela and Sanele Bhili, appeared at the Mthatha Magistrates Court yesterday. Luthando, an Eskom employee with two children, told the court he looks after his sick mum. His son Luyanda (18) is a grade 8 pupil. Sikelela is a traditional healer, while Sanele is an electrician. State prosecutor Siphokazi Muurman said the court was too congested with other matters, including three bail applications. She said the case could not continue as the investigating officer had been subpoenaed to the High Court for another case. Bail was opposed by the state. The accused face charges of premeditated murder, conspiracy, housebreaking with an intent to commit robbery and robbery with aggravating circumstances. The case was postponed to 19 December for a formal bail application. Belinda, whose throat was slit, was killed on 14 November at Bhongweni Village in Mthatha. Belindaâ€™s best friend, Phumza Gambula, said she was happy that the state had opposed bail. Women also came in their numbers to oppose bail and support the late victim.
