BHEKANI Nsibande has loved the People’s Paper for many years. But the paper seems to be causing problems between Bhekani and his wife. Bhekani from Zola, Soweto, said he wasn’t ready to part ways with his favourite newspaper. His wife Agnes said her husband was going too far. Bhekani’s collection of Daily Sun copies dates back to 2014, and it keeps growing. She said: “I understand he loves the paper. I love reading it, too. “But I don’t want his collection in my house. “I don’t want cockroaches in my house. I’m worried the papers might cause health problems.” Bhekani said he had packed the papers neatly. “The copies are sorted by day, month and year. I make sure there are no insects because I don’t want my paper to rot,” he said. “Daily Sun news matters to me and the community. I love the paper because it cares about people. “I know a lot of people who’ve been helped by the paper.” Bhekani said his wife convinced him to get rid of the collection. “I’m not looking forward to letting go. I’ve worked hard to ensure the collection is packed neatly.” Bhekani agreed that in the end his wife’s decision was important. “I love the paper but I love my wife more. If I have to choose, I’ll choose her. She’s the ultimate love of my life,” he said.
