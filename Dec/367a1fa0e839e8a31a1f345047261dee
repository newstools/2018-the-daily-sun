THE family of a man found dead at work said they were waiting for post mortem results before taking action. Mduduzi Mthembu (34) from Somkhele in Mtubatuba in northern KZN was found dead inside an acid plant at Foskor in Richards Bay last Wednesday. His sister, Mphile Mthembu (36), told Daily Sun the management said they didn’t know what led to Mduduzi’s death. According to Mphile, however, several of Mduduzi’s colleagues said he was killed by toxic fumes. “We won’t rush and jump to conclusions, but we will get to the bottom of this. “Mduduzi had indicated a few times that it was not safe working for this company. “Knowing that he was qualified for his job, we never paid attention as we thought he had everything under control,” said Mphile. She said they last saw Mduduzi on the weekend before he died. “He told us about a protest that they were planning to have over the issue of safety.” She said he stopped coming home a few months ago until his wife Siziwe Mthembu (27) went to his rental place. “When she got there she found him with severe dark marks over his entire body. “When she asked him, he told her it was caused by acid from his workplace.” Foskor CEO Ufikile Khumalo said they were investigating the incident. “The department of labour and cops were also notified and they have already started their own investigations. “We will be providing them with all the necessary support until the investigation is complete,” he said.
