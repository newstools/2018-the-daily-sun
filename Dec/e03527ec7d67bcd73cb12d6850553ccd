THE Nxumalo family from G section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, is down in the dumps. Their two-roomed house crumbled right in front of their eyes on Thursday. Luckily, no one was injured. House owner Simangele Nxumalo (51) told Daily Sun it happened during the day while her son and his friends were outside. “My son was sitting with his friend in the shade. “They said they suddenly heard a loud noise and then there was dust everywhere,” she said. Simangele said they stood back and watched as the whole house crumbled to the ground. She said her house had terrible cracks that she had reported to the councillor. “These two-roomed houses are old. It started to show cracks five years ago. “Last year’s storm made it worse, and I reported to the councillor hoping that he would get it renovated like the other houses. “He came to see the house, but did not return – not until it collapsed.” She said on the day it collapsed, she had called him and he arrived with a person from the municipality’s disaster management team, who took pictures of the house. “I have not heard anything since he left,” Simangele said. “Now I do not know if they will rebuild my house soon. “Other people are busy buying furniture and preparing their houses for Christmas, but now I cannot. “I do not even know where I am going to put my groceries. “My family and I will have a bleak Christmas this year,” she said. “I pray they do something fast,” she said. WHILE other families are busy repainting their homes, buying new furniture with their savings and making sure that everything’s in order for the festive season, this family has no house at all. The Nxumalo family from G section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, are down in the dumps. This is because their two-room house crumbled in front of their eyes and they are only left with the rubble. Councillor Nhlanhla Shezi said: “The municipality’s disaster management department will rebuild the house soon.”
