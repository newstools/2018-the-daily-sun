RESIDENTS couldn’t believe the chaos at a garage in their area was caused by pee. Residents of Bakerton in Springs, Ekurhuleni, are still shocked after the shooting at the Caltex garage in Welgedach Avenue on Saturday. The drama started after a passenger, who had a bottle of beer in his hand, got out of a bus at the garage and peed on the pavement. A woman cashier came out of the garage and apparently moered the passenger with a sjambok. The passenger got aggressive and threw the beer bottle at the woman. When the owner of the garage saw this, he came out and shot at the passenger, who was rushed to hospital where he’s recovering. Springs police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora told Daily Sun a case of attempted murder was opened. The garage owner was arrested. Resident Vuyiswa Mabaso (36) told the People’s Paper she believed the whole thing could have been avoided. “I think we’re an angry nation. We resort to violence every time something doesn’t go our way.” Thobeka Dingiswayo (42) said the drama was not necessary.
