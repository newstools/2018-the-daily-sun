ON MONDAY, dead taximan Samuel Phelembe’s wife received a brand-new Toyota Quantum. Eunice Mbatsane (51) lost her husband in 2008, when he was gunned down by members of a rival association. Excited Eunice said she was thankful for her special gift. “Life was so difficult after Samuel’s death. “I had to work on a farm by cutting sugarcane to raise my seven kids. I hope our lives will now change for the better.” The taxi was donated by members of the Mkhuhlu Thulamahashe Taxi Association during a function at Bunny Khosa Secondary in Ximhungwe, near Bushbuckridge. Eunice couldn’t hold back tears when association secretary Patrick Rikhotso told of the bloodshed during the fight for the Gauteng route. “This route was not easily achieved. There was bloodshed, though 14 members survived the bloody attack,” said Rikhotso. “Loyal taxi driver Samuel was gunned down by heavily armed rival taxi association members along a road between Tshabalala and Hazyview. “His family has been suffering, so today we’re handing over this new vehicle to help them out as their breadwinner is gone.” His boss Phara Khoza said they will help Eunice go to driving school and guide her in the taxi business. Santaco provincial deputy chairman Judas Phoku said: “We’re grateful for what you have done. “I’m sure Samuel’s spirit will now rest in peace and we’ll help his wife to be registered as a taxi owner.”
