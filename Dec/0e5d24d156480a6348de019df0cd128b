THE water crisis in the Vhembe District of Limpopo is reaching boiling point. Many local villages have been without water for days on end. They include Muledane outside Thohoyandou, where residents are threatening to boycott next year’s elections. Residents of Muledane Block N have not had a drop of water for two weeks, despite water coupons bought from the Vhembe District Municipality. Residents who have the means have to drive to nearby Shayandima to fetch water from relatives, while others bought water from locals who have bore holes in their yards. Resident Cynthia Ravhuhali said the past two weeks have been hell for them. “We have suffered enough. We need water. This has been the longest time we have been without water. “We use it for drinking, washing and the worst part, our toilets need water also. “Our houses are now stinking,” she said. Cynthia said they were excited to be told they would be getting water from a municipality tanker on Tuesday, but this did not happen. “We waited for the truck from 8am in the scorching sun, but it did not show up. We are tired of empty promises and if they don’t come today we will get them during elections,” said another resident. Block N civic secretary Maria Tshivhase said they reported the water shortage to the local councillor, who promised tankers would bring water from Tuesday. Vhembe District Municipality spokesman Matodzi Ralushai confirmed there was a water shortage in villages around Nandoni Dam as a result of a damaged pump.
