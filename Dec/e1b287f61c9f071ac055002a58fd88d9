ACTRESS Dezry Kay is looking for the right man who will make her happy. She said her past relationships were bad and does not think about them. Dezry, whose name is Desiree Kekana, said she has not had sex for over a year and has become used to it. “I want to focus on my presenting, acting and music career. “I have been in love with men who were not serious about being in a relationship.” Dezry said the last one was a learning curve. Irresponsible men wasted women’s time. Women matured faster and didn’t have time to play around. “Women need marriage and family. At the moment I’m single, but if the right man knocked on my door I’d give him a chance. But with conditions. “No more hit-and-run relationships for me.” At the end of the month, she will sign a contract to join Radical FM, the online radio station, to present the Chart Over Tea show. She’s busy shooting season 13 of the SABC2 reality show It’s for Life, which airs on Thursdays between 11 and 11.30am. Dezry and her partner Prisca Ndlovu run a spa in Sandton. She released her hip hop single Nkatoge, featuring DJ Guru, this month. In January she will perform in Canada.
