THE road is now damaged with lots of potholes, causing a headache for road users in Siyanda, north of Durban. Residents living nearby say the road has been damaged by water flowing on it since 2013. And no one knows where the water comes from. They said their pleas for the leaking water and damaged road to be fixed seem to have fallen on deaf ears. Residents say they have reported the problem to eThekwini Municipality several times, only to be given reference numbers. One of the residents, Simphiwe Dlamini (57), said when the water started leaking he was the first to report the matter to authorities. “I was given a reference number and hoped they would come. But they did not. I called again and they gave me another reference number, but still the matter was not attended to,” he said. He said he gave up because he realised that the municipality was not willing to help at all. Another resident, Sikhumbuzo Ngcobo (35), said he also reported the matter in 2016 when the water had started to damage the road’s surface. “I was also given a reference number, but no one came to fix the problem. We do not understand why they do not come to our area,” he said. “I do not blame the councillors, because they are not the ones who should fix the roads – it is the municipality workers at fault.” He said they do not know where the water comes from, but suspect it is from the underground pipes. “Maybe the pipes are old. The municipality should send engineers to come and check what could be the problem.” The SunTeam sent an email on Sunday and Monday with a list of questions, which were not responded to. On Tuesday we also called the munipality’s offices, but the phone rang unanswered. There was still no response at the time of going to print by late yesterday.
