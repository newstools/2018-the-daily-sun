Ralph Hasenhuttl has been tasked in reviving Premier League strugglers Southampton's fortunes after being named their new manager on Wednesday. The 51-year-old Austrian – who comes into the role on the back of Mark Hughes being sacked on Monday – has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with the club. Hasenhuttl attracted Saints' interest through his success at his previous club RB Leipzig, guiding them to second in the Bundesliga in the 2016/17 season and the Europa League quarterfinals last term.He left Leipzig after they finished sixth in the 2017/18 Bundesliga campaign. "The urgency to find a path back to our potential and to the results that we expect cannot be underestimated," said Southampton chairman Ralph Krueger in a statement. "For that reason, we are extremely pleased that Ralph Hasenhuttl has agreed to become our new manager and do all he can to help guide us back on that path."
