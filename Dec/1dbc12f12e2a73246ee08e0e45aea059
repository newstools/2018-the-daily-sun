THE Bushbuckridge Local Municipality recently visited the community of Majembeni. It was revealed the area had one of the highest rates of gender-based violence in the region. Community Liaison Officer responsible for gender, women and children Dimakatso Shai said: “We are here to find solutions on how to resolve this issue in this community.” Shai said parents played a role in the abuse, especially in situations where the abuser was the breadwinner. She urged parents to report abuse. Resident Tutula Mashigo from Shatale said: “I’d like to urge parents to take action if they hear their kids bully other kids at school in order to avoid a situation where the child grows up to become an abuser.” Randzekile Mathebula from Sonke Gender Justice said their organisation was also working to find solutions to the challenges. Flossy Ngobeni from Sanca gave lessons on the role booze and drugs play in abuse. Social development MMC Krisjan Mokoena called on leaders to raise gender-based violence awareness.
