 Pastor Timothy Omotoso is back in the High Court in Port Elizabeth on Monday. He will hear if the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) has made an order on whether to grant his application for Judge Mandela Makaula to recuse himself from the case. Makuala in October previously rejected the defence's two applications for leave to appeal his ruling that he won't recuse himself, citing that there were "no reasonable prospects of success".   If not, the court could either decide to proceed with the trial, or to postpone proceedings again to a new date in the new year. The court will go on recess at the end of this week.  Either way, Omotoso will likely spend his second Christmas behind bars, having first been arrested in April 2017 and denied bail.  The defence accused Judge Makaula of protecting Zondi as well as making questionable judgements when he wished Zondi well for her examinations. "The grounds for my recusal are dubious," Makaula said in response. "It is ridiculous in the extreme to assume that I had accepted Miss Zondiâ€™s version of events before the accused has testified. I am taken aback by this argument, there is nothing to suggest that I was consoling Miss Zondi."
