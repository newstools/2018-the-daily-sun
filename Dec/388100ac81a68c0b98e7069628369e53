HE faced some hard knocks in life. But Lindokuhle Mtshali (25), from Katlehong in Ekurhuleni, never let it get him down. Diagnosed with polio, Lindokuhle was left to fend for himself on the streets when his father left him. Instead of giving up, he said he rose above his terrible circumstances and became a man. WHEN Lindokuhle Mtshali was just three years old, life gave him a mountain to climb. The little boy was left to fend for himself on the streets when his father left him . . . and he was diagnosed with polio. But instead of this hard life beating him down, Lindokuhle said it taught him how to become a man. “The streets taught me every trait of becoming a man. I am a risk taker, brave and respectful. “I am also dedicated and I have the drive to do anything I want to do,” said Lindokuhle. He said the streets shaped his dreams and gave him a purpose in life. “I am here to change negative mental attitudes into positive ones,” said Lindokuhle. He said it was discovered that he had polio when he was three years old. “I was unable to walk like other kids and I do not even know how it feels to walk. “I have been in a wheelchair for 22 years. This is where I learnt to accept who I am,” said Lindokuhle. He said he did not care when other people called him names and he had made peace in his heart with him being disabled. “I’ve finished matric despite delays due to my health and other circumstances,” said Lindokuhle, who also completed a learnership in information and technology end user N3 through the National Institute for the Deaf last year. This year he is busy with level 3 of the same course. He said his dream is to create a transport app to help disabled people. “The transport system is failing disabled people dismally,” said Lindokuhle. Lindokuhle is also a kwaito singer and rapper and has recorded and released eight singles so far. His most popular single is I am a Fighter, which speaks about his life.
