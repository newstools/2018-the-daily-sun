THE men in blue will pay one of Mzansi’s popular strip clubs a visit. But it will be a different type of visit – the two cops will be playing music that night. Constable Lucky Matome of Tarlton police and Captain Richard Munyai of Jeppe police are booked to entertain patrons of the famous Summit Club in Hillbrow on Friday. The two cops, commonly known by their stage names Scylash and DJ Rich, said it would be their first time playing at a strip club. During weekdays the two spend the day chasing down thugs, and on weekends they make people dance. Richard said when they perform they use the platform to educate people about the risks of drug use, as well as drinking and driving. Richard, who has been a DJ since high school, said being a cop was his first love and music was a fun hobby he enjoyed. He said: “I don’t jeopardise my career and I’ve learnt to balance the two.” Lucky was recently nominated at the Mzansi Kwaito & House Music Awards last month. Although he didn’t win any award, being nominated was good enough for him.
