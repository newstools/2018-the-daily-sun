KWAZULU-NATAL’s retired nurses want to pay it forward. And KZN health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo could not be happier. This emerged at Newcastle in the KZN midlands on Friday, when the MEC met with nurses from the Amajuba and Uthukela districts to discuss how they could share their knowledge. Dhlomo said a helping hand from these retired nurses was much needed in the department, therefore it was important that they discussed how they could plough their knowledge and skills back into the industry. “The retired nurses spoke to us and said there are certain values and cultures in the nursing profession that seem to be disintegrating and must be revived,” said Dhlomo. He said in ensuring that patients were treated with care at all times, one of the things the retired nurses mentioned was the need to have an equipment pool. “They said you can’t have one broken machine and run around looking for a replacement because the one that is broken was the only one available.” He said retired nurses also said a nurse was meant to wear shoes that have laces, not be in high heels because they cannot predict what will happen during the course of a day. “If a nurse has to run and push a patient quickly on a stretcher to theatre or to casualty, the nurse must be able to do so without fear of the shoes falling off,” said Dhlomo. “We are going to take a lot of lessons from these retired nurses going forward. “Nurses, among all healthcare professionals, are the people who stay with the patient the longest. They are the ones who know the patient better than anyone else. “So we must tap into their expertise, because they are rich with knowledge and wisdom,” said Dhlomo.
