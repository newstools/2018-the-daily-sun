A SEVEN-year-old boy has the gift of being able to see
and speak to the dead, says his mum. According to the Sun, Tricia Jordan from Newport, south
Wales first realised her son Luca was able to communicate with the spirit world
when he was as young as 18 months old. Now seven years old, baby Luca would chat and sing songs
with his dead great gogo. Speaking to the Daily Mail, Tricia said: "My
grandmother passed away when Luca was 18 months old. He had just started to
speak, and the first thing he told me was how Granny would tuck him up in bed.
I found it really strange. It used to scare me, and I’d change the subject. "One of the creepiest things was him singing The Big Ship Sails On The Ally-Ally-O,
which she always sang to me. He would sing it over and over, and tell me how
Granny was there. I had never sung it to him. There is no way he could have
known this song. "As time went on, I realised he wasn’t scared so it
was all right." There were other occasions too which pointed to Luca
being in touch with the spirit world. For example, one day they drove past a house near their
home. Luca said that a man called Martin used to live there but
had died in a fire. Deciding she needed to check to see if it was true,
Tricia did some research. And it was true: a man called Martin had lived there, and
he did die in a fire. Tricia said: "I have always believed in the spirit
world a little bit, but what I have seen with Luca blew my mind. It made me
believe completely."
