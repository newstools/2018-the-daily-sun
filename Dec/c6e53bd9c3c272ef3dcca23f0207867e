SHE was the only survivor in the taxi after a horrific accident that claimed 27 lives. As she was pulled from the taxi’s wreckage among its tally of 22 bodies, her chances of staying alive was dimming by the minute. But on Wednesday, following a week in a coma and another month in intensive care, Thabitha Sehata (25) from Marobjane in Bochum in Limpopo finally went home. Tears of joy flowed as Thabitha was reunited with her family and friends. The Blouberg Municipality and the Blouberg Taxi Association were also present to welcome her back home. The accident in September involved two cars, a minibus taxi and a truck. Thabitha had told how one moment she was chatting to a fellow passenger in the taxi, the next waking up in hospital with drips and an oxygen mask. Following her stay in intensive care, she was transferred to a normal ward at Sunshine Hospital in Benoni, Gauteng. Thabitha had been on her way to Tembisa to find a job when the accident happened. All her fellow passengers including the driver died in the accident. Eighteen of the deceased from the minibus were buried at a mass funeral while others were buried individually. Thabitha, who broke down in tears when the SunTeam interviewed her, said that she’s happy that she survived. “I would like to thank everyone who visited me during my stay at Sunshine Hospital until I was discharged and the authorities who made sure that I arrive back home safely.” Her father Makwena Sehata said: “I’m glad that she’s back home. “I had lost hope that she would live. When I first saw her after the accident, I couldn’t believe my eyes. She was seriously injured. I was so happy the day she woke up from her coma and smiled at us,” said Sehata. “In her I saw the power of God. She is my miracle,” he said. It’s alleged that the front tyre of a truck carrying cement burst, causing it to plow into oncoming traffic, crashing with vehicles including the taxi Thabitha was travelling in.
