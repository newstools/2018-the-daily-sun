ALL Paulina Mthombeni wants is for Home Affairs to fix her age. She says she has been robbed of four years of her life. The 62-year-old from Tsakane, Ekurhuleni says she wanted to apply for a social grant but could not because of her official age, which is 58. “Life is difficult. I just want to help mkhulu with finances and better our lives,” said Paulina. She said she had arthritis and could no longer work. “I used to be a domestic worker, but I am now old and sick. I can’t work.” Paulina said she could not stay at home and do nothing, as she has five kids to support and the only source of income is her husband’s pension. She told Daily Sun she spent a lot of money on transport over four years, trying to get her age fixed. She went to the Home Affairs offices in Nigel, Springs and also Pretoria, but still could not get help. “There is nothing I have not done. “I showed them my baptism certificate and went to Home Affairs with my family members. “What else could I possibly do?” According to Home Affairs, Paulina was born in the same year as her sister, Martha Nkabinde (58). They say Martha was born in May, while Paulina was born in June. “It cannot happen that sisters are born in the same year, just a month apart. That makes no sense,” said Paulina. “They should be seeing this, but they will not because they just do not want to help me.” Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the matter had been referred to the relevant department for investigation. He said Home Affairs would be able to help as long as Paulina had proof she had been robbed of her years.
