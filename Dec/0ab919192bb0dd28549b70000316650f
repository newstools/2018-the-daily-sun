THEY live in mud houses, have no electricity and drink dirty water. Villagers from Mabululwane in Vryheid, KZN, said despite voting in all the elections, nothing had change in their village and they felt forgotten. Lungisa Thabede (31) said since she can remember there has never been electricity, water or RDPs and their roads still are dusty. “We used to fetch water from the borehole and rivers. “Now the councillor provides water for us once a week, but when the water in the house is finished before the water truck comes, we go to the river.” She said they use candles for light. “In 2017 they installed solar power, but we have to pay R150 a month for it. It is used only for lights. “If we do not have R150, it means our homes remain dark and we use candles for light.” Mthokozisi Dlamini (45) said they had to get a tractor to level the road. “In our village the councillors have been changed three times, but none of them has developed it. “They only come when they need our votes, and after that they disappear.” He said they wanted the councillor to develop their area and not remember them only when he needed votes. “We also want RDPs because we are tired of sleeping in our mud houses, and for them to deliver services because they always make promises when they want our votes,” he said. Councillor Phaphama Mbatha said: “Since I started my term I have organised trucks that deliver water weekly. “I am working on installing electricity and water.” He said the solar power was not installed by the municipality, but by a private company. “Villagers were told the company would install for free, but they would have to pay R150 a month and they agreed.”
