BAD health forced former Orlando Pirates striker Thulasizwe Mbuyane (36) to quit football. He was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2011 and he hung up his boots in 2014. “Quitting football was not easy,” he said. When Thulasizwe retired, he was playing for Royal Eagles in Durban. He said wherever he goes, he has to explain his retirement. “I’m tired of people asking me the same question over and over. They must leave me alone.” He said he wanted people to know he can’t play because of his health. “I had to accept the situation as I didn’t want to leave my children without a father. “People should know that sometimes life is not fair.” The father of three – two girls and one boy – is now living in Ben Fleur, Emalahleni, where he runs his business Infini Innovation and Juju Mbuyane Investment. He started the United Football Academy after he retired. “My aim is to share my football talent with children,” he said. He said he’d do a coaching course from next month. The former Bafana player said he hated losing. “As players we’re judged about what we have achieved by people who don’t know the facts.”
