EVEN though there has been a lot of improvement when it comes to curbing HIV/Aids-related deaths, there is still a long way to go. This was the sentiment voiced by eThekwini’s mayor, Zandile Gumede, on Saturday. Gumede was addressing hundreds of residents at Siripat sport grounds in Reservoir Hills, Durban, during an International World Aids Day celebration. More than 4,2 million South Africans are on the HIV treatment programme, which has helped monitor the disease and resulted in a drop in fatalities. Gumede urged those on the programme to not stop taking their medication. “If a person dies of Aids these days, they are choosing that path voluntarily because we have a proper programme that ensures those who are infected live longer.” She urged people who are not infected to ensure they use condoms, so they are safe from contracting the sexually transmitted disease. Resident Nokubonga Zungu (34) said they were grateful to have such events, but she wished they did not happen only on World Aids Day. “These events are an eye opener.” Before the event there were voluntary HIV, diabetes and blood pressure check-ups.
