GEORGE Mancho has been waiting for an RDP for 15 years. The 42-year-old from Hostel 1 in Mangaung said it seemed government had forgotten about him. He said other residents had been given RDPs, but he still lived in a shack. “I have been living here for 19 years. When construction workers arrived 10 years ago to build RDPs, I was happy. “I thought it was finally time for me to move out of my shack and live in a proper house,” said George. “But everyone got a house except me. “Life is tough, because I still live in a shack while other people enjoy the comfort of their homes.” He told Daily Sun he first applied for a house in 2003. “When I went to ask in 2013 why I had not heard anything, I was told I was not on the waiting list. I then reapplied. “When I went to find out again in 2015, I was given empty promises,” said George. “The construction team came and promised to bring material, but nothing happened. “Sometimes I dream I am sleeping in my RDP but when I wake up I am still in a shack.” George said he could not build a house for himself because he is unemployed. “I am unemployed and collect empty bottles for recycling. “The money I make won’t be enough to build a house. Life is not easy here. My roof leaks when it is raining,” he said. Human settlements spokeswoman Senne Bogatsu said George was on their system as approved, but on hold. “This means the applicant’s RDP will subsequently be built once those before him have had their houses completed,” said Bogatsu.
