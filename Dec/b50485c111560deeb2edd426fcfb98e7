GOOD news for Sassa grant recipients! According to the agency, January payments will be brought forward. Sassa Gauteng spokeswoman Nandi Mosia, said: “Social grants payments for January will be paid from 28 December. This applies to beneficiaries who collect their money from Post Office outlets, ATMs and merchants.” Mosia said beneficiaries who receive their money from cash pay points would continue to receive their money on dates provided to them from previous payment. She said it was important for beneficiaries to understand that the early payment for January was not a bonus or a double payment. “In spite of what people see on social media, Sassa does not pay a bonus. “If a beneficiary collects their January payment on 28 December, they would have already collected their January money. “Their next payment will be for February,” said Mosia. Money will not be deposited into the old Sassa cards as from next month. Any beneficiary who does not have the new card by tomorrow will not be paid next month. “This is the final call that Sassa is making. The deadline will not be extended,” said Mosia.
