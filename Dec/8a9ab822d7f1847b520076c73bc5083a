THE four thugs tried to hijack a car but were killed instead! Clifford Shongwe of the Ekurhuleni Metro cops said the men hijacked a red Audi in Devon in the early hours of Saturday morning. They were spotted by a traffic cop who called for backup. They realised they were being followed and shot at cops, who returned fire. The Audi driver crashed into a cop car. A cop sustained slight injuries and was rushed to Suikerbosrand Hospital, Nigel. “Police caught up with them on Main Street near Wimpy in Nigel. “They crashed into the cop car, causing both vehicles to lose control and crash. “Four thugs died at the scene and their bodies were taken to the government mortuary.” He said the SAPS fired at the vehicle and the Metro cop didn’t fire any shots. A 9mm pistol was found in their car.
