MEN should wise up. This is the serious warning from members of the Siyaphumelela Stokvel in Mzimhlophe Hostel, Soweto. They spoke to Daily Sun after they saw pictures of two stokvels making the rounds on social media. One picture is of a men-only stokvel, while the other is of a women-only stokvel. The male stokvel is about nothing but booze, while the women focus on groceries. Mama Nombuso Sokhela, who is an organiser for the Siyaphumelela stokvel, said men who used stokvels to enjoy booze were unfair. “The same people who do not save anything for groceries will be the ones eating first,” she said. She said men should start saving for good causes. “You cannot save for the whole year only to get drunk in December. Save for something that will benefit you and your family,” she said. She said in their stokvel they did not save only for food. “We have different departments. Some save for blankets, furniture and appliances among others,” she said. “You buy with cash and owe no one when you get your lump sum. You are safe from taking loans from banks.” But Thulani Mkhize (35) said they enjoyed having booze at his stokvel with amagents. “It is not as if we waste money. We support our families, and with the remainder we save we have fun at the end of the year,” he said. He said they worked hard throughout the year and a little fun at the end did not cause any harm to anyone. “As heads of our homes we are usually the ones giving our women or parents money for their grocery stokvels in the first place, meaning we do contribute to a good cause.”
