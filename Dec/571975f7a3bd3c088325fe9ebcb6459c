“BEING in the pilot’s seat of an aeroplane was a dream come true for me.” These were the words of aspiring pilot Thabang Khumalo (17) from KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga. Thabang took to the skies for the first time on Friday at Wonderboom Airport in Pretoria. Thabang was the winner of the #Iwanttobeapilot competition that was run by Fly-Zulu Aviation, an online platform that connects different people within the aviation industry using different social media. He told Daily Sun that flying the plane felt like something he was born to do. “I was not afraid at all. I think I was great up there. Awesome,” he said. The grade 11 pupil could not contain his excitement when he spoke to the SunTeam. He said his first flight confirmed that he should turn his passion for flying into a reality and become a pilot. “I am very happy for the experience,” he said. He told the People’s Paper his love for aviation started in grade 7 when he overheard one of his classmates talking about wanting to become a pilot. “I did not know what I wanted to be, so I went home and did research on pilots and discovered that it was interesting. “That is when I decided I wanted to become one,” he said. He said he planned to get seven distinctions in grade 12 next year so he would be able to apply for bursaries to realise his dream. He said if that failed, he would join the South African Air Force. For the #Iwanttobeapilot competition FlyZulu Aviation partnered with Eagle Air Flying School and AHRLAC holdings. Joseph Matebane, CEO and founder of FlyZulu, said the competition hoped to bridge the gap between aspiring pilots from disadvantaged backgrounds and people already in the industry.
