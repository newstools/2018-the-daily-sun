THE Mudau family from Pile Dzimauli outside Tshilamba in Thohoyandou, Limpopo, are having sleepless nights. Their loved one, Tshilidzi Mudau (48), is missing. He was last seen wearing grey trousers and a grey T-shirt. According to the family, he withdrew his disability grant money at Spar Tshakhuma, just outside Louis Trichardt, on 2 November. He again withdrew part of his grant at Pick n Pay in Benoni, Gauteng. Elder brother Phanuel said Tshilidzi is mentally challenged.  He had previously disappeared but later came back home. “This time he hasn’t come back home, even though I spoke to him on the phone once,” said Phanuel. “The last time I spoke to him was on 3 November.  He told me he was in Jozi. But they never heard from him again. “His phone is off. We’re worried about his whereabouts. We’ve reported him missing to the police “We’ve searched for him everywhere, with no success.” Phanuel said they believed he was still in Benoni. He told Daily Sun Tshilidzi’s disappearance was affecting his ageing dad Jeremiah. “My dad is heartbroken, and he can’t even eat or sleep. “We hope SunReaders will help us find Tshilidzi,” he said. “We’ll be meeting as a family during the festive season and it won’t be nice if Tshilidzi isn’t around. We pray for his safe return.” Anyone with information should call Warrant Officer Nakedzani Raedani on 076 488 4789 or 08600 10111.
