THIRTY-ONE passengers can fill two taxis, but in this case they were squeezed in one! When Metro cops stopped the taxi, big mamas, men and small children jumped out. It seemed the driver wanted to make extra cash by doubling the load. The taxi had a Chatsworth sticker on it. This shocking discovery was made by Durban Metro cops who conducted an operation on Mahatma Gandhi Road in Durban on Sunday. In the one-minute, 18-seconds video posted on Facebook by cop Steven Middleton, the passengers jump out of the taxi as cops count them, one by one. The video was shared 1 691 times and viewed by 61 000 people. Facebook users expressed shock after seeing the video. Mpumi Mabaso said: “This is not an overload. This is worse. We only know of one extra person when it is late and there is a high demand.” Nhlanhla Max wrote: “Chatsworth taxis don’t care about people’s lives at all.” Rashida Steyl wrote: “This is one of the reasons people are dying on the roads and it’s not funny anymore.” Spokesman Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said Metro cops were conduction an operation in the Durban CBD when they stopped the Quantum taxi. He said the taxi had 16 extra passengers. “The driver was immediately arrested and charged with overloading. “He is expected to appear in the Durban Magistrates Court today,” he said. He said Metro police would intensify their visibility as road users were not willing to comply with road rules. “Since December started, we’ve arrested 165 drivers for drunk driving,” said Sewpersad.
