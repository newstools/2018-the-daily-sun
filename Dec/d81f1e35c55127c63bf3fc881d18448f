PAYday in December is bonus time. But in Mzansi, the extra cash only brings more tears for many baby mamas, wives and girlfriends. That’s because they won’t taste the fruit of their men’s labour as they don’t share their bonuses but instead disappear from the scene. Relationship expert Dr Thapedi Mofokeng told Daily Sun why husbands and boyfriends leave their partners during the festive season, especially when they receive bonuses. He said there was a sinister motive behind this common problem. “When husbands and boyfriends leave their partners after they get their bonus, it speaks to a deep-rooted desire to get up to no good,” he said. “The men hide behind the excuse that it’s the festive season.” Mofokeng said such men portray psychological issues that have been left unattended, and this has far-reaching consequences. “The consequence is that these men are disrespecting their partners and are ultimately destroying society with this behaviour,” he said. A woman said her husband of seven years, with whom she has two children, always disappeared over the festive season. “When he gets paid his bonus on the 15th, he starts spending less and less time with his family. “Eventually he disappears for days, sometimes weeks, at a time.” Another woman said her boyfriend of nine years started acting strangely. “As soon as he started getting a bonus, he stopped buying stuff for me and our six-year-old son,” she said. Matshidiso Tiba (35) from Rockville, Soweto, said she always forgave her husband, even though he had pulled his December disappearing act since he got a promotion at work four years ago. “He’s the sweetest and kindest from January to November,” she told Daily Sun. “But when it comes to December, it’s like he becomes another person. “I will always take him back because he’s the father of our two daughters.”
