27-year-old rapper, Fifi Cooper has paid her late mentor, Jabulani ‘HHP’ Tsambo’s gravesite a visit. The Mahikeng-born rapper, whose real name is Refilwe Boingotlo Mooketsi was en route her hometown to perform at the iconic Maftown Heights festival. When she arrived in Mahikeng, her first stop was the gravesite of HHP, who died in October this year. His passing left a great void in the hearts of many South Africans from fans to industry peers like Fifi. The rapper said that she just couldn’t go to Maftown Heights and perform without making this all-important journey. “I had to come see u before I do this. Hope u looking down proud of me grootman. Not easy doing Maftown Heights stage without you but I love you and ima kill it,” she said. I had to come see u before I do this ??
