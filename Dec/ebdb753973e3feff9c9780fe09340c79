THE days of drivers parking their taxis in the sun and rain and street vendors selling food at a dirty taxi rank are over. Drivers and vendors are happy after the launch of the renovated taxi rank in Richards Bay. The “new” rank, which cost the city of Umhlathuze R21 million, was officially opened on Tuesday by Mayor Mduduzi Mhlongo. Part of the campaign to transform Umhlathuze’s transport sector, the renovated rank with new toilets and trading stalls can now shelter all taxis. Vendor Gloria Mkhwanazi (45) was happy to see the development that will help grow her business. “We did not have enough space, nor a clean environment. We cook food, so we needed more space. “Now we will have cooking stalls we can clean often. People will feel free to buy our food.” Taxi driver Muzi Hlabisa (34) said they are happy now they do not have to park in the scorching sun. “We will wake up happy to go to work because our rank will be clean and we can eat lunch in a clean space. We are happy our municipality cares for us.” Mhlongo said the renovation fell under the project’s first phase and a rank for buses will be built during the second. He said: “We urge all residents to look after this facility. Those who cook here should keep the rank clean and commuters should keep the toilets clean.”
