TWO million rands was raised during the first Forever Young Gala and Ball – all in the name of the late Nelson Mandela. The event was held in Joburg as part of the launch of the Mandela 100 celebrations. Festivities ended with the Global Citizen festival: Mandela 100 at the FNB Stadium, south of Jozi, on Sunday. Dr Maki Mandela, Mandela’s eldest daughter and chairwoman of the House of Mandela Family Foundation, said the glittering event was a “triumph of the giving spirit that was the hallmark of my father’s vision throughout his life”. The live auction raised just under R1,5 million, while the silent auction was open online and offered the whole world an opportunity to own a piece of Mandela’s legacy. Most items in the silent auction were personal treasures from the Mandela family collection. Donated items included a Black Panther mask signed by the movie’s cast and the late Stan Lee, and a 100-year-old bottle of cognac selected in Madiba’s honour. Maki said: “Food security affects us all and agriculture is a major way we can create wealth for our people. It’s in line with my late father’s legacy. Proceeds from this auction will go towards realising this dream for him and for our people.” The ball’s charity auctioneer, Joff van Reenen, said: “The original Mandela pastel work of Robben Island is one of the 22 pastels and for the past 14 years until last night formed part of a single collection held by his heirs.” A bidder from Senegal, another from America and a third from Mzansi took offers to more than R1,1m, and at the end of the night the Senegalese won with a bid of R1 120 000.
