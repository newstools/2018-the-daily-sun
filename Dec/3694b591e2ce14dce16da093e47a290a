Hip-Hop producer and DJ, Ms Cosmo has released her final single of the year, titled 88. The song is her third single this year and it features rappers, Kwesta, Solo and Kid X. The DJ, whose real name is Nonqaba Nozuko Rwaxa, dropped the single fresh from her Dubai trip where she played at two different festivals. The single is a seamless mixture of kasi rap and eloquent flows with a catchy sing-along chorus as they celebrate being born in ‘88. The track is already available across all digital music streaming platforms and Ms Cosmos says making it was a trip down memory lane. ICYMI: MS COSMO LIVING IT UP IN DUBAI “I’m proud to be an 88 baby, and I wanted to celebrate that with my fellow school of ’88 mates like Kwesta, Solo and Kid X. I really love this song! Producing it with Trey really took me down memory lane and so I’m excited for everybody to get to just how we stand out as hardworking 88’s,” she said. She has also expressed what a thrill it was working with Kwesta, whom she has shared the studio with before, as well as Solo and Kid X. “As always Kwesta was a real pleasure to work with. Matching him up with Kid X and Solo wasn’t difficult at all, as they already all share great musical chemistry – making the process of making this song, incredibly phenomenal,” she continued. A little birdy has told the Daily Sun that the music video for the single will drop early in 2019 and will be “cameo-filled”.
