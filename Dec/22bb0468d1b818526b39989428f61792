PASTOR Kenneth Hlaisi of Full Gospel Church is not just a man of God. The 38-year-old pastor from Makuleke Village, outside Malamulele in Limpopo, is also an artist. Kenneth discovered his drawing gift at a tender age. At first, he drew house numbers, house plans and made cardboard house models. “After matriculating in 2 000, I couldn’t further my studies due to financial difficulties,” said Kenneth. “I came up with a plan. I drew the names of local shops and house numbers for a few villagers free of charge.” He said after seeing his art, people started demanding his services. Even people from Joburg hired him. “Shop owners in Alexandra, Tembisa and Soweto hired me to do my art in their shops,” he said. He charged customers between R200 and R350, depending on the size of the work required. In 2007, he was offered a three-year diploma scholarship by a local pastor to study at Giyani Bible College to become a pastor. “In 2009, I was given the full responsibility of heading the Full Gospel Church in our village,” he told Daily Sun.
