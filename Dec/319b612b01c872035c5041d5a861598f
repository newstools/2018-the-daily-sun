DON’T mess with Skeem Saam! This was the message SABC1 got from thousands of viewers after the popular soapie disappeared off TV screens on Tuesday night. The viewers saw nothing but a blue screen with a message of apology that read: “Sorry about the interruption to your viewing. “Our teams will get you back to your favourite show as soon as we can.” The screen then showed an image of one of the show’s actress, Amanda du Pont, flashing her engagement ring. Scores of Twitter users lashed the broadcaster. Mutshekwa Thendo: “Manager of SABC showing us his wife to be ka force.” Thabiso: “I should have gone to bath rather than wait for this blackout of this Skeem Saam shit. Ndebe Matross: “Is it my TV or is there something wrong with the SABC?? Bongani Kaunda: “My mum said the television is tired. Thank you, SABC.” Malume Diesel: “I hate SABC. Why don’t they mess up the Afrikaans news on SABC2? “We spend the whole day looking forward to Skeem Saam. You only have ONE JOB!” Des Erised: “I think the SABC team are having their Christmas party today! Everyone is drunk there.” SABC spokeswoman Neo Momodu said: “The SABC would like to apologise to the public for any inconvenience caused in their television viewing last night. “This was due to the intermittent breaks in the transmission of broadcasts.” She said engineers had taken care of the problem with their broadcasts. “All television programming is now back to normal.”
