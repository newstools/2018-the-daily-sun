THE GOGO lived peacefully in her yard for 10 years. But then a stranger moved in! Anna Ngake (82) from Caleb Motshabi in Mangaung, Free State said one day she went to church and when she returned, a surprise was waiting for her. There was a mkhukhu in her yard. The mkhukhu has been there since August. The woman who built the shack refused to leave, claiming she was given permission by a local councillor to live in the gogo’s yard. “I don’t know where the strange woman comes from. I called cops, who advised me to take the matter to the municipality. “But the municipality failed to help me and now there is no peace as I am always fighting with this woman. She is rude to me,” she said. Gogo Anna said the woman told her she was sent by the councillor. “He also did not want to help me when I approached him. This curse will kill me. My high blood pressure is always high. I used to have a garden with beautiful and fresh vegetables, but I am now forced to leave it because of the dirty water being poured on it,” she said. The stranger, Nontuli Makomfana (40), said she was brought there by the councillor. “He told me there were two yards and I can erect my shack. I am not going anywhere. Me and my two kids need a place to stay. The yard is too big for gogo, she must just learn to share. “I am not fighting with gogo, she is the one fighting with me,” said Nontuli. Ward 10 councillor Johannes Majara said: “I don’t have a right to give anyone a site. The lady is lying, I never gave her a place.” Mangaung Municipality spokesman Qondile Khedama said: “I’ve requested officials to investigate the matter. After we find out who the rightful owner is, they will remain on the site. This matter will come to an end. We apologise to the old lady for this.”
