A 22-year-old woman from Texas in the USA, decided to use her birthday party to shame her cheating boyfriend in front of all of their friends by breaking up with him in a speech. Tiana Perea discovered that her boyfriend, Santos, had been sending text messages to another woman and waited for the perfect time to end their relationship, Fox News reports. After drinking some tequila, the birthday girl turned to Santos and began her speech as their friends surrounded them to record the moment, reports Metro UK. Tiana began by thanking her friends for coming to the party, which was held at a private home, news.com.au reports. Her speech took a sudden turn when she revealed that she knew all about Santos’ cheating ways, even confronting him with details of the messages. “I’d like to thank Santos for making me realise I deserve so much better,” she said. “All of us have seen screenshots – you were sexting her and sending her videos.” “You literally sent her the same picture you sent me today.” A stunned Santos didn’t say a word throughout the entire breakup and was later handed a duffel bag with his belongings by Tiana’s brother. The video of the breakup has since been uploaded on Twitter and has been viewed more than five million times. Tiana’s speech has been applauded and criticised on social media with some saying her method was ‘cold’ while others commended her for publicly shaming him. She has since updated her followers stating that she’s still single, in case anyone was interested.
