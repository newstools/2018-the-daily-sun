HE TRIED to help the gogo as she was being robbed, but it nearly cost him his life. On Monday the man from Uitenhage in Port Elizabeth rushed to help an old woman who had her bag with cash inside snatched, but he was shot during the fight. Police spokesman Sergeant Majola Nkohli said: “The incident happened on Rich Street, when an old woman was attacked and her bag snatched by an unknown man. He fled with her bag, which contained a large amount of money.” Nkohli said a passerby who witnessed the incident gave chase and tried to overpower the suspect. “It is believed that a second suspect armed with a firearm shot and wounded the 32-year-old man. “The two suspects ran away with the bag and the injured man was taken to hospital. Police are investigating a case of robbery with aggravating circumstances and attempted murder,” said Nkohli. “At this stage it is believed that four suspects were involved, and they are still at large. Police are appealing to anyone with information to contact the nearest police station or call 08600 10111.” Nkohli advised stokvel members not to carry large amounts of money at this time of the year.
