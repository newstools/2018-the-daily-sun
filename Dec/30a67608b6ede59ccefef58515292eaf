THE Lord works in mysterious ways. That’s the testimony of Saston Mashao (40) and his family. Thugs broke into his home in South Hills, south of Joburg, while he and his family were sleeping and made off with a washing machine. His daughter made the discovery. Moved by the holy spirit, Saston gathered his family and they prayed at the spot where the washing machine had stood. Saston was specific in his prayer. He prayed on the spot where the washing machine had stood for the washing machine to be found by 8am. After the prayer, he immediately took to the streets. And sure enough before 8am, the search led Saston to a pawn shop. Saston told Daily Sun the holy spirit helped him find his washing machine. “I was led by the holy spirit, which told me to drive around and look for pawn shops,” he said. Saston said the holy spirit guided him to a pawn shop, where his machine was allegedly pawned minutes earlier. When he enquired about his machine to the pawn shop owner, he got the shock of his life. The machine was there, and it had arrived just before 8am. “I couldn’t believe it,” said Saston. “It was my first time seeing that shop and my first time inside a pawn shop. The holy ghost told me to go to the pawn shop.” Alberton police spokeswoman Constable Daphney Phooko confirmed that cases of fraud and possession of suspected stolen goods were opened.
