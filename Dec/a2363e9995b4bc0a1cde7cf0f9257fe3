ANC stalwarts and veterans have lashed out at BLF president Andile Mngxitama, calling him a thug. The organisation said he knew that actual violent acts and threats of violence would attract media coverage way beyond the small group of the BLF supporters. The veterans said in a statement: “Once perceived as a young revolutionary, this association and self-appointed ‘commander’ of the paid black T-shirted private army of the Guptas has exposed himself as nothing more than an opportunist hired thug that many might perceive as a neofascist.” Mngxitama has been making headlines recently following remarks he made last Saturday in Potchefstroom, North West, encouraging supporters to kill white people. Mngxitama said: “We will kill their women. We will kill their children. “We will kill their dogs. We will kill their cats. “We will kill anything that comes for us.”
