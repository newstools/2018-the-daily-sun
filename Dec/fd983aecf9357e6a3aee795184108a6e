THE national minimum wage of R20 an hour is far too low! This is according to President Cyril Ramaphosa, who announced the minimum wage last Friday. He said the wage of R3 500 a month was only a start to reaching a living wage. Speaking in Kliptown, Soweto, he encouraged South Africans to learn skills so no one would be left behind. “We noted those who said the starting minimum wage of R20 is far too low, but we needed to look at creating a balance to sustain the need to increase the level of employment.” Earlier in the day, Ramaphosa delivered the keynote address at Constitution Hill to on the 70th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He said there was a gap between the Constitution and the lives of the people on the ground.
