HE claimed to be a wealthy prince, owner of property and
handsome plantations. But in reality, he was a dodgy estate agent looking to
lure an unsuspecting foreigner into his snare. According to Punch, this is what Nigerian cops are
alleging about Mathew Adedoyin (40). Cops claim Adedoyin tricked American Tawanda Lynn Jackson
(46) to come to Nigeria by pretending online to be a wealthy prince from the
Arogbatesu Royal Family of Ile-Ife, Osun State. They allege that he then held her hostage and repeatedly
raped her when she fell for his story and arrived in Lagos on 11 November. Director of Lagos Command, Betty Adoki, said: “Adedoyi
said that his father was a former king of Ife Titun, Osun State and that he was
the heir apparent to the throne. He further lied to the victim that he owned
several buildings in Lagos, including where Jackson was held hostage. “But the victim started to suspect a foul play when he
was losing patience and said he rented the place, a ramshackle place that he
had earlier claimed his father owned.” Adedoyin was also said to have lied to the victim that he
was an exporter of ginger and bitter cola, had large plantations of cocoa and
palm trees, and claimed that he had lots of slaves working for him. Adedoyin reportedly seized Jackson’s passport, credit
card and US identity card in order to prevent her possible escape. He and his alleged accomplice, Idowu Ayeni, are accused
of intending to extort money out of Jackson. It was only on 26 November that Jackson was sprung from
her place of imprisonment by cops, who had been alerted by the American Embassy
that Jackson had gone missing. Adedoyin and Ayeni are being charged with internet fraud,
kidnapping and rape. They deny the charges.
