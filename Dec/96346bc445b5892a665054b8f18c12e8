WITH Mzansi experiencing an unemployment crisis, many job scammers have been preying on desperate people. Now the Joburg Metro Police have also been hit by a social media scam promising jobs. Public safety MMC Michael Sun this week took to Twitter to make the public aware of some of the scams making the rounds. He tweeted: “SA’s unemployment rate among young people aged 15–34 is 38,2%. “More than one out of three young people do not have a job. This also gives rise to operators taking advantage of our young people with fake job opportunities. JMPD is not recruiting.” Metro Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said a year ago victims of a scam travelled all the way from Limpopo to try and get jobs. “There is a hoax advert targeted at young, innocent people. These people spend over R2 800 to get a job that does not exist.” Minnaar said there were 23 job seekers from Limpopo and they had paid the scammer between R2 800 and R20 000 each for a job. He said the Metro Police were not recruiting as they already had new recruits undergoing training, which they would finish in June. He warned the youth to be aware of fake job adverts and said the department did not advertise on social media but in newspapers. A few weeks ago, Chris Hani- Baragwanath Hospital was hit by a similar scam. A number of people paid for fake jobs and then flocked to the hospital, only to be told they had been scammed.
