THE usual response to walking in on a thief in your house
is to freak out, or at least call the cops. But Mike Cammell from Kingston, south New Zealand had a
different response when he surprised a burglar after returning home from work
on Wednesday night. According to Sydney Morning Herald, Mike said: "I
opened the door and there's a guy standing in the middle of my lounge having a
big old feed with all of the stuff in my pantry." Mike, who had had a hard day, just looked at the man and
asked him: “Who the f**k are you?” The burglar was a big, dirty-looking man in his 40s. He
replied: “Sorry mate. I'm homeless and just really hungry.” Mike was furious seeing this stranger stealing food meant
for him and his 10-year-old twins. He angrily told the thief that there are
right ways and wrong ways of doing things as he repacked the food the man had planned
to take with him. Mike said: "He had his head down most of the time I
was shouting at him so I started feeling a bit sorry for him. "I told him if he turned up and said he was hungry,
I would never turn him away." Mike packed up another bag of food and gave it to the
man. "Then I noticed he had my work boots on," he said. The man asked if he could keep them, but Mike gave him a
spare pair of boots to take instead. "He said, 'Thank you' and I escorted him off the
property.He shook my hand and said, 'Sorry'," said Mike. Mike, who is a single dad, was going to leave it at that.
But he decided to call the cops when he saw that the man had broken in through
his kids’ bedroom window. “Alarm bells rang immediately - in case he ever returned.
I didn't want to call the cops, but he has to learn you can't keep doing that,”
he said.
