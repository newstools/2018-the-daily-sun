The death of Skeem Saam
character Tbose Maputla played by Cornet Mamabolo left a lot of fans upset and
devastated on Tuesday night. The popular character died
after he got in top fight with his nephew Noah which led him to being stabbed
on his heart. Shortly after the episode
aired, fans took to their social media asking
themselves if it is the end of Tbose’s character. Views shared their messages
of heart breaks as they couldn’t believe what just happened. The 28-year-old actor from Limpopo posted a picture
of himself and his onset family captioned: “As I drop the MIC it’s been GREAT!!!” We are
not sure if that’s a hint, but at this point, it seems like Cornet is making an
exit. He has quickly become one of the most loved
actors in Mzansi. He earned the love of Mzansi through his starring role and has
been with the show for seven years. It is not clear if this is really the end,
but many will truly miss Tbose.  As I drop the MIC ... it’s been GREAT!!! A post shared by  Cornet Mamabolo (@cornetmamabolo) on Dec 4, 2018 at 9:11am PST
