THIS MUM blames the cops for her unborn baby’s death. While she was seven months pregnant, Nonhlanhla Nzama (37) from Enkanini squatter camp in Durban inhaled tear gas. “Cops threw tear gas at us on 16 November. “I went for a check-up two days before that and nurses told me everything was fine.” She said cops came to the squatter camp in numbers and threw tear gas at them while entering their shacks. She said she inhaled a lot of the gas on the day of the chaos, and her water broke. She was rushed to hospital, where she spent eight days. Doctors said she and the baby were fine, but five days after she was discharged she was rushed back to hospital after she noticed blood flowing down her legs. “This time, doctors told me I had lost my unborn child and was going to give birth to a dead baby.” Nonhlanhla believed her child, whom she buried last Monday, was killed by the tear gas. “When I went for my check-ups, nurses never told me I might give birth prematurely, let alone giving birth to a dead child.” Abahlali Basemjondolo provincial chairman Mqapheli Bonono said: “Cops at the Mayville cop shop refused to open cases of assault. “People who kept trying to open cases were threatened. “Poor people’s lives are being destroyed without any consequences.” Durban gynecologist Dr Noluyolo Sigcu said: “In all cases I have worked with, I have never heard that inhaling tear gas can lead to loss of life of an unborn baby, but I will do research.” Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said on 16 November Cato Manor cops were in the Enkanini area when they were attacked by a group of violent residents. “Residents blocked the road and attacked the cops, who had to use rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. We are not aware of a woman who was choked by tear gas. No one came forward to report it,” Zwane said.
