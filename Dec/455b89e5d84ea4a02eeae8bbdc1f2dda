 A picture of a taxi with UBERBUS branding on the side has
sent Mzansi into shock mode. Immediately after people saw the picture, they gave Uber the
advice that it would not end well as the taxi industry wouldn’t let it fly
under the radar. However, the company set the record straight – saying UberBus was launched in Cairo, Egypt. “We have no plans to launch this product in South Africa and
we would never contemplate launching it without full industry engagement and
support,” the company said.
