A VIDEO of her singing at her home went viral on social media. The voice of Nosipho Ngubane (13) from Mpophomeni in Howick, KZN Midlands,  captured the hearts of many on social media. But the state of her mud house, which looked like it would fall any time, came as a shock. Many blamed government for not doing anything to address housing issues in poor communities. The #FeesMustFall activist, Mcebo Dlamini, was also touched. He went to the girl’s home to donate groceries at the weekend. Construction of a new house for Nosipho’s family is also expected to start soon. Mcebo was taught to share from a young age. His granny taught him to share even the smallest of things. “The house looked unsafe, yet she had it in her to motivate others with her song despite her circumstances,” he said. “As people we must feel each other’s pain. “I’m grateful that people have come forward to help with the building of the house.”
