WHEN two of Mphephu Hlungwani’s cows didn’t return to her kraal, she knew something was wrong. The 56-year-old discovered her cows had been eaten by lions that escaped from the Kruger National Park on Friday night. Mphephu, from Makahlule outside Malamulele in Limpopo, said she searched for her cows in the bush on Saturday morning after they failed to return to the kraal the previous night. “I discovered my cows dead and half eaten,” said Mphephu. She said she wasn’t happy about the situation. “I’m an unemployed widow with six children. I’m angry at the lions for killing my cows because the cattle were a source of income for my family. I sell my cows for between R8 000 and R10 000,” she said. Mphephu said one of her cows was killed by the lions a year ago in the same bush. Hasani Chauke (51) also lost cattle to the lions. “The greedy lions have been killing my cows since January. “My fear is that they’re going to kill us as well if they aren’t captured by rangers,” said Hasani. Thomas Chauke of SA Wildlife Trade and Regulations said: “We’re hunting down the lions that killed the two cows. “In the meantime, we appeal to farmers to make sure livestock is locked in the kraal by sunset.”
