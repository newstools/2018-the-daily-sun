SA men’s under-20 coach, Thabo Senong, believes that his boys can still hit another gear at the Cosafa Youth Championships in Kitwe, Zambia. Amajita take on Zimbabwe in the final tomorrow at the Nkana Stadium (3:30pm) as they look to defend their title. They head into the final in confident mood after scoring ten goals without conceding in their three games so far in the tournament. Despite this form and the praise they have recieved especially for their defensive exploits, Senong insists there is still room for his charges to improve that aspect of their game heading into the final. “We need to fix our defence because South African players get selfish sometimes, they want to enjoy the ball but when they don’t get the ball they get frustrated. “We need to change that culture to say football is about all the moments and we must be prepared to be present in every moment." Senong also bemoaned the fact that his team only had one day to recover before tomorrow’s final. “With so little time for recovery, the quality drops in the next game because the players are still tired, the standard will drop technically, and the energy levels will go down. “We are developing kids and we are running away from injuries, we also want to see quality football especially in a final.”
