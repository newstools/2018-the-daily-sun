THE COPS are looking for three suspects who committed rape in separate incidents over the past months. According to Krugersdorp police spokesman Tshepiso Mashele, a victim was walking to a taxi rank when she was approached by two men who grabbed her from behind. “One suspect strangled her, while the other pointed a knife at her. “She said they walked past the taxi rank and dragged her to an open veld, where the suspects argued about what to do with her. Shortly after that, one of them left,” said Mashele. One suspect aged between 26 and 30, who remained with the victim, allegedly raped her and took her to a nearby shack. “She said the suspect warned her not to make a noise as people in that area would gang-rape her. “He continued to rape the victim for the rest of the night and escorted her out of the area. She later reported the matter to the police,” he said. In a separate incident in May, a child was playing with her friends in the nearby mountains when she was raped. “The child said it got dark while they were playing and they decided to go home, but on their way home they saw a man aged between 30 and 40 coming their way. She said the man started chasing them and tripped her,” said Mashele. He added that the suspect pulled the victim to nearby bushes and raped her. “After raping the child, he let her go and she was able to run home and tell her parents as well as street patrollers,” he said. Meanwhile in Tarlton, Krugersdorp a suspect aged between 26 and 30 is wanted by the police for raping a woman in October. “The woman alleged that the suspect grabbed her and put a knife to her neck and told her that he wants to sleep with her. When the victim refused, the suspect raped her twice,” he said.
