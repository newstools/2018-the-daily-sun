Legendary South African singer and songwriter, Kelly Khumalo has a very strong message for all the nay-sayers who always have an opinion about her life. “I actually don’t care about people, they should know this by now. I just live my life the way I want to [and] whoever says whatever, it is their business, not mine. I actually do not care,” say Kelly. The songstress was on V Entertainment on Friday to chat about her latest work and her new engagement to fellow musician, Chad da Don. ICYMI: KELLY: I’M LOOKING FOR A MAN! She made this "don't care" declaration when V Entertainment presenter, Nomuzi Mabena asked her how she felt about people saying she was in a fake relationship. Kelly has always had to deal with negative comments about her life, particularly her love life on social media and the media in general. In addition to people making RIP jokes about Chad, a lot of people have also questioned how it is that five months ago, Kelly revealed to her bestie, Thami Dish on Touch HD that she was looking for a man, and now she not only has one but they’re engaged already. KELLY HITS BACK AT “4-5 SUCKING TROLL! But despite all of this, Kelly is unbothered by what anybody has to say and she continues to make this very clear in her interviews and on social media. She also took the opportunity on V Entertainment to dispel the rumour that their relationship is a publicity stunt.
