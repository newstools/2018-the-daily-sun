KHAYELITSHA residents will be better prepared in case a fire starts in their kasi in the future. City of Cape Town’s Disaster Risk Management Centre partnered with insurance company Santam and installed 500 smoke alarms on Saturday. The donation came after a fire in October at SST Section in Khayelitsha which left one dead, 342 structures destroyed and 1000 people homeless. The insurance company’s head of marketing development John Lombeck said: “This is part of our municipal support programme. We support communities when disasters happen. “For the last few years, we’ve tested these smoke detectors. “We also want to roll them out in Imizamo Yethu.” Shabiro Mrabalala (34) said his brother died in a shack fire in 2007 and believes he could have been saved if they had detected the fire earlier. Chairman of the portfolio community of safety and security Mzwakhe Nqavashe thanked the company for their contribution. “The City already institutes several measures as part of its fire and flood risk mitigation but partnerships such as these go a long way to improve the safety of residents in informal settlements,” said Nqavashe. Disaster Risk Management Centre head Greg Pillay said: “Many fires start while people are asleep. So these smoke alarms are meant to act as a warning system with the ultimate aim to reduce the extent of fires as well as the risk of injury or even death.”
