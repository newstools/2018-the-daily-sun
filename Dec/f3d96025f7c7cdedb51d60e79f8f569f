NEW York City cops at the weekend were looking for an unlucky man who had dropped an engagement ring down a grating while proposing to his fiancee! A shared video showed the man fumbling the ring before laying down on the pavement in Times Square and peering into the grating while his partner looked on in concern. “She said ‘Yes’ – but he was so excited he dropped the ring in a grate,” the cops wrote on Twitter. They found the ring, but now they are looking for the happy couple. – REUTERS
