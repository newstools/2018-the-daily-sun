THERE have been calls from local ANC structures for Emfuleni mayor Jacob to leave. Despite Khawe’s apparent refusal to hand over the mayoral chain, his days as mayor are reportedly numbered. According to Daily Sun’s sister publication News24, Khawe will vacate his office next week. His spokeswoman Lebo Mofokeng, at the time of going to print, hadn’t responded to queries the People’s Paper sent her. But in response to News24, the mayor had said: “One thing I can guarantee, there’ll be no Christmas where Jacob Khawe is the mayor of Emfuleni.” Khawe has been at loggerheads with the ANC’s Sedibeng regional executive committee in the south of the Vaal, which has demanded that he steps down. The tension comes after the mayor was elected as the provincial ANC secretary in July. He was due to take up the job three months after he was elected, but that deadline expired at the end of November. Khawe said he would only do so after outstanding reports had been finalised. “The financial recovery plan by Treasury is not ready, the signing off of Section 56 employees is not ready and both of those are done by national and provincial governments. The Hawks have not given me feedback. Instead [they] have given me questions,” said Khawe. He said Emfuleni speaker Elisa Maipato had suggested that a special council sitting be called once the reports were concluded so that he could submit his resignation. “As we speak, the speaker has a resignation letter; it doesn’t have a date and signature because we want to process this thing as I promised,” said Khawe.
