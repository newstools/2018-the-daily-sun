EFF leader Julius Malema celebrated the end of the year with the elderly at his home town of Seshego. Malema handed out food parcels and also donated a tractor to the elderly which he said should be used to work the land. Nwes24 reports that the event is held annually as part of the party's apparent efforts to woo the elderly to the EFF whose membership is predominantly young people.Malema said: "Festive season is a season for celebration and giving. That is why we have come here to celebrate with the elders of Seshego."However, the event was almost marred by claims that some elderly people were turned back and told their food hampers would be delivered at their homes.Resident Ephraim Manamela claimed: "I bought food for some senior citizens who have been standing outside the entrance while EFF security refuse them entry and tell them they must go back home as hampers will be brought to their houses."The claims were dismissed by the party.Several elders who spoke to News24 expressed appreciation for the food hampers.Â Mampho Monyane, 63, said: "We are grateful about the hampers but I cannot speak about the politics. The politicians themselves will deal with the matters that affect the country. I'm happy that we are being looked after as elderly people."
