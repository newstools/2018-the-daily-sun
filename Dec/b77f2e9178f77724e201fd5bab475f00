FOR six years the two families lived in rundown houses, but today they’re smiling. The families from Newcastle, northern KZN, have been given new houses and brand new furniture! Mayor Makhosini Nkosi presented the houses to a madala and to a family of four. Ntombikayise Khumalo (27), the head of the family of four, said their four-roomed house was old and falling apart. “When the rain came the house was easily damaged The local disasster team gave us black plastic to cover the roof but it didn’t help.” Their lives changed when Nkosi came into the picture. “A team came to assess the house and realised renovating the house was impossible. “They said the house should be built from scratch. The process was started earlier this year. “I was praying that we’d not spend another Christmas inside the falling structures. We’re grateful.” Andries Khanyi (78) and his wife Mboniseni (69) said they had been living in terrible conditions since 2012. “We had a great Christmas in our renovated house. We now sleep peacefully because we’re no longer afraid the house will collapse,” said Andries. The houses, both of which are fully furnished, are valued at R135 000.
