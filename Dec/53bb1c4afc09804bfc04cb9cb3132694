NO-NONSENSE Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt is not happy with his team’s Absa Premiership home record. For a team that hopes to reclaim the Premiership trophy from holders Mamelodi Sundowns, the Clever Boys are not doing themselves any favours by dropping points at home. They’ve had three defeats in 12 games and this displeases their ambitious coach. The Clever Boys lost to SuperSport United, Polokwane City and Bloemfontein Celtic in front of their home crowd. Fresh from beating Kaizer Chiefs 2-1 in their previous league game, Golden Arrows will fancy their chances of collecting maximum points when they visit the Students at Milpark Stadium tonight (7.30pm). Wits defeated rookies Black Leopards 1-0 in Limpopo in their previous outing. Said Hunt: “I’m not amused with our home record in the league and the players know that. I won’t tolerate this dropping of points at home any longer. “It bothers me and I’m not happy about what is happening. We have a fantastic away record but when it comes to our home record it’s a different story.” The Clever Boys had a break due to the Telkom Knockout final last week, but Hunt insists that the break didn’t help them. “I would have preferred to have kept on playing. You know that I’m not a fan of the break. I want to play every week. This stop-start thing is not working for me. Maybe it will be to Arrows’ advantage but not for my team. We want to play every week.” Hunt said his squad got a clean bill of health. All he wants is to collect the three points: “We have to try and win the game. We can’t keep dominating our opponents and not finish them off. We didn’t deserve to lose the three games we’ve lost this season.”
