FRANS Mohlala House is becoming a painful place to work in if you’re implicated in the VBS scandal. Imityaaz Mohamed, who worked as a finance manager in the ANC office in Limpopo, has resigned. His resignation comes after he was implicated in the VBS scandal for soliciting donations from the collapsed mutual bank. ANC chief of staff David Nkoana had written him a letter with intention to fire him, but Mohamed decided to vacate the office. He sent his resignation letter to Limpopo secretary Soviet Lekganyane, chairman Stan Mathabatha and Danny Msiza, who resigned from his treasurer-general position a few days ago. According to Mohamed, the letter said he should state why he shouldn’t vacate his office immediately. “This implies that I could be suspended where no evidence exists,” he said. “The donations by all accounts were above board and collected with the full knowledge of the PEC officials.” He said the letter requested that he inform them of his fundraising techniques. Mohamed said the methods that were used were the same as those of most political parties. “This leads me to believe I’ve become a victim of a political squabble,” he told Daily Sun. He therefore resigned with immediate effect. “By no means should this be concluded as an admission of any guilt,” he said. Since last week, the office of the provincial secretary had been receiving resignation letters from implicated party officials whose municipalities invested in the bank. This comes after the NWC of the party instructed them to step aside to allow investigations to continue without interruption.
