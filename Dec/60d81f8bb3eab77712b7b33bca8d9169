Cellular network provider Vodacom has decided to keep some of its stores closed until further notice. This follows this weekend's attack on its franchises in Polokwane and Makhado in Limpopo. "The safety and security of customers and franchise staff remains paramount," a spokesperson for Vodacom told News24 on Monday. He did not elaborate on which stores would be affected. Self-declared members and supporters of the EFF,Â many in the party's T-shirts, attacked at least two Vodacom stores on Sunday. This follows a lecture by ANC stalwart and Corruption Watch chairperson Mavuso Msimang at the Vodacom Journalism Awards which included an image depicting EFF leaders Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu as "abusers of freedom". "Vodacom respects the right of every South African to freedom of expression and to hold legal and peaceful protests, but condemns any form of violent behaviour, including wanton destruction of property associated with such actions," the company's spokesperson said. Msimang was invited to give the keynote address at the awards ceremony on Thursday to speak on the importance of media freedom and why it should be preserved, News24 earlier reported. Three women were assaulted and goods were stolen at the Polokwane franchise at the Mall of the North. "We understand that the business owner is cooperating with authorities," the Vodacom spokesperson explained.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/some-vodacom-stores-to-remain-closed-until-further-notice-after-attacks-20181203
