JUST a week after the murder of an ANC councillor in Tubatse, Limpopo, another ANC councillor’s car was shot at and torched. The incident involving a councillor candidate for ward 10 in Mogalakwena, Kgakile Majadibodu, happened in Marulaneng Village outside Mokopane on Saturday night. Majadibodu’s car was shot at by unknown suspects and caught fire. The suspects fled the scene and are still at large. ANC spokesman in the Waterberg district, Matome Moremi-Tauatsoala, said these criminal elements won’t stop them from emerging victorious next week Wednesday during by-elections. The by-elections follow the resignation of Rosina Masipa as councillor. “We’re not shaken by this barbaric act, which seeks to scare the candidate. “We urge responsible citizens to provide information which will help the police bring the suspects to justice,” said Tauatsoala. Provincial executive committee member and Mogalakwena mayor Andrina Matsemela said it was disappointing to hear of the incident, which took place after the party worked hard to ensure there was peace for free elections. “We are confident that the police will work around the clock to arrest the suspects. “Just last week, an ANC councillor in Sekhukhune was shot dead. The perpetrators must be brought to book,” said Matsemela. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed the incident and that police were investigating. He called on people with information that could help police to arrest the suspects to come forward.
