THE young girls who were selling their bodies at the now closed Sibanye Gold Cooke 3 mine shaft have stopped going to the mine. Daily Sun reported last month that girls as young as 13 in Bekkersdal, Rand West City, were selling their bodies to mine workers, security guards and zama zamas at the hostel there. The girls would drop off their books at home after school, put on short skirts and go to the nearest mine to sell their bodies. Cops and mine security responded to the story. Cops and security guards swooped on the mine hostel to rescue the girls last Wednesday, but discovered they were no longer in business after their story appeared in the newspaper. Instead cops arrested 18 other female suspects – aged between 22 and 42 – for trespassing. The older magoshas asked:told the People’s Paper the young girls ruined their business. “Why are cops arresting us? “We are adults. We have been in this business a long time. We know what we are doing.” “We have been trying to stop these girls from coming here, but they said they’re young with fresh blood. Now we pay for their sins.” Sergeant Linkie Lefakane of the Bekkersdal cop shop said 10 of the women appeared in Westonaria Magistrates Court and paid R100 admission of guilt fines. Five were released on warning and three are still in cells waiting to pay the fine. Parents of the young girls said they were grateful to Daily Sun. The girls sold their bodies to zama zamas, security guards and mine workers. “Maybe our children will go back to being kids instead of experimenting with sex,” said one mum. “They must also arrest the men who had been sleeping with these kids.” The parents of the two girls who appeared in Daily Sun said the girls had stopped going to the mine. The girls went to the mine to sell their bodies for extra cash. One girl said she supported her siblings as her mother wasted her salary on booze.
