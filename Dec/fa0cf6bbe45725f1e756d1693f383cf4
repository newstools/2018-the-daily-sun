Former Orlando Pirates coach Ruud Krol has denied reports linking him with a return to the Absa Premiership. Krol famously won the treble in 2011 with the Buccaneers and has since become something of a legendary figure to Sea Robbers supporters. The Dutchman was reportedly linked with Kaizer Chiefs last season while Steve Komphela was still in charge. Soccer Laduma website reported that the 69-year-old submitted his CV for the role should the under-fire Komphela resign or be sacked at the time. Krol has once again been linked with the Glamour Boys with current mentor Giovanni Solinas said to be on thin ice, though Krol denies this to be the case. "No, no... I have spoken in the last year only with SuperSport (United) to come back to the PSL," he said. "We could not find an agreement. South Africa will always have a special place in my heart. "I will always be open to come back to the country. I had tremendous time there." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
