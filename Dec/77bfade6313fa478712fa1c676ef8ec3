THE FAMILY were still trying to deal with the news of the nine-year-old boy’s death on Sunday when they found his gogo had died of shock. Gogo Busisiwe Shandu (55) from Mthwadlana in Nongoma, northen KZN, collapsed and died on Sunday after learning that her grandson Mnelisi Mncwango drowned on Saturday. Family member Zandile Buthelezi (43) told Daily Sun it was difficult to accept the double tragedy. “Mnelisi drowned in the Mthwadlana River while making his way home with other village boys after herding cows,” Zandile said. She said the river is usually quite small, but on Saturday it was full following the heavy rain on Friday. She said after hearing through village boys that Mnelisi had been caught by the river, they rushed there to save his life. “But when we got there it was too late. He was already dead. “Busisiwe was there when his dead body was pulled from the river. We saw the shock on her face. “She kept saying she had never seen anything like that in her life,” Zandile said. She said they were lost for words when she collapsed and died on Sunday. “The shock of losing the boy and what she saw on the day of his death was too much for her,” Zandile said. Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “An inquest docket has been opened by Nongoma police after a nine-year-old boy drowned in the river in the Magonsini area. “The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated. “Nothing has been reported to the police about the death of his gogo.”
