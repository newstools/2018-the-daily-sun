ZODWA is ready to wow the people of Namibia with her dance moves and her daring outfits. But her dance moves are not an automatic passport to get her into that country. Zodwa Wabantu and everybody else remembers how she was deported from Zambia in March because of her style of dancing without panties. Now she is worried about getting into Namibia, where she’s scheduled to perform tomorrow. She told Daily Sun she was not worried about filling up the venues or whether people will enjoy her dance moves. ‘People are waiting to see my moves, which are unique and beautiful,” she said. “My greatest worry is whether I will be allowed entry into Namibia.” She said she was ill-treated in Zambia and Zimbabwe because the governments in those countries were not comfortable with her dancing without her panties. She said the Zambian and Zimbabwean governments told her they were Christians. “The Zambian government said my dancing undermines national values.”
