THE fight against gender-based violence does not end today. It is an ongoing battle. This is what Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane told people attending a ceremony for the closing of the 16 Days of Activism For No Violence Against Women and Children. The event was held at the Ikhaya Lethemba victim empowerment centre in Evaton yesterday. The MEC said Sedibeng had a high rate of gender-based violence cases, which was why the Gauteng government saw it fit to open a centre in the area. “The area is notorious for mushrooming taverns where people indulge in alcohol and substance abuse,” said Nkosi-Malobane. Alcohol abuse was evident even on the day. At least four visibly drunk women attended the event, which took place before noon, along with a few nyaope boys. Nkosi-Malobane said: “Victims are treated as if they are suspects. We must change the attitude toward victims so they find it easier to come forward.” The centre will offer services such as psycho-social services, medico-legal services and court preparation support to ensure the successful conviction of perpetrators. “All these services are available at the centre effective from today. I would like to urge our people to make use of these facilities and safeguard them,” she said. She pleaded with the community not to burn facilities during service delivery protests. Amanda Lusaseni, who has survived gender-based violence, said: “I am a victor today because of the centre. I am happy to see more places like this being opened.” Mapatai Radebe said: “I hope with the opening of this centre, victims will seek help and perpetrators are arrested and prosecuted.”
