THERE’S no turning back for the Khoisan community. They said this was the first time they spent Christmas without their families. Six Khoisans have been camping at the Union Buildings for more than three weeks as they wanted to see President Cyril Ramaphosa. “We celebrated Christmas without our families. “We will celebrate the New Year at the Union Buildings. “Ramaphosa must address us, and if he doesn’t come we will stay here until we see him, not anyone else,” said Chief Khoisan SA. They decided to erect their tents next to Madiba’s statue as he was the first democratic president. “We’re angry with Ramaphosa and government as they’re not taking us seriously and don’t listen to our grievances,” he said. He said Ramaphosa should not just come but should implement the four demands they made last year. “We need recognition as the first nation, as well as recognition of our language which should be made one of the official languages,” he said. He said they also wanted the Land Act of 1913 to be removed from the Constitution and that all issues regarding land needed to be addressed with indigenous people. “We also want the coloured identity that was already removed in 1991 to be once again removed from government documents,” he said. Chief Khoisan SA said government was not treating them fairly, considering that they were the first people to live in Mzansi.
