TWO officials from a private vehicle testing centre in
Musina have been arrested on allegations of fraud. The examiner and a data capturer employed by Thulalushaka
Vehicle Testing Station were arrested by a joint team of anti-corruption
investigators from the Road Traffic Management Corporation. Road Traffic Management Corporation spokesperson Simon Zwane
said the two said the two colluded to provide roadworthy certificates to
vehicles that were never physically tested. "An identity document of an innocent person is believed
to have been used in the fraudulent transactions, to create an impression that
the person had delivered the vehicles to be tested," said Zwane. Zwane said documents and computers were seized when
ant-corruption officers raided the premises, they will be used in ongoing
investigations. He said the arrests are part of an ongoing initiative to
ensure a safer festive season by proactively preventing the licensing of
un-roadworthy vehicles and addressing corruption within the licensing and law
enforcement sector. The arrested officials are expected to appear in court on
Monday.
