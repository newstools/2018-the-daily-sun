PUPILS must be taken care of during and after school hours! This sentiment was expressed by Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga at the launch of the After-School Programme at Refilwe in Cullinan, east of Tshwane, recently. MMC for community and social development Ntsiki Mokhotho told Daily Sun: “The programme is a critical intervention aimed at responding to the social challenges facing our youth in the community. “It adds to the educational environment by providing various activities that enable pupils to explore and pursue their interests outside the classroom.” Activities include: - homework assistance - life skills - sport - public speaking. She said the programme would be rolled out all over the city. “It’s clear that we need to change the trajectory for many of our young people living in our communities,” said Mokhotho. “We believe that regular and consistent participation of pupils in such programmes will improve their outcomes, reduce the school drop-out rate, curb drug abuse and reduce risky behaviour.”
