THE three heroes ran the Soweto Marathon recently in uniform to honour their fallen comrades. Firefighters Nkosi Mzolo, Siphiwe Tshabalala and Nhlakanipho Khoza were this week presented with certificates and trophies by the City of Joburg’s emergency services. Simphiwe Moropane, Mduduzi Ndlovu and Khathutshelo Muedi lost their lives while trying to put out a fire at the Bank of Lisbon building in the CBD in September. Eight of their colleagues were injured in the fire. The three were given certificates of recognition and awards by emergency services acting chief, Arthur Mqwa. Spokesman Robert Mulaudzi told Daily Sun the three runners showed the families of the dead firefighters their sons did not die in vain. The runners completed the 42km race in six hours and 22 minutes. Mulaudzi congratulated them for making it to the finish line. “The last 12km took its toll on the three, but they were happy to have made it to FNB Stadium. All their gear combined weighed 18kg! “During the race they changed from their firefighters’ boots to comfortable running shoes to avoid developing blisters.” The three said they were grateful for the recognition.
