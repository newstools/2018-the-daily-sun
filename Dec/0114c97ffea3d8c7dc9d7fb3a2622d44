FOLLOWING their drama-filled 2-2 draw with Polokwane City on Tuesday, Highlands Park head coach Owen Da Gama believes inexperience could very well have been the reason for their failure to win the match. But despite the draw, the man affectionately known as “Rubberdoll” said he remains proud of his young chickens, many of whom are new to the Absa Premiership and still trying to find their feet. “We have many youngsters from the NFD (National First Division), and they are still learning,” explained Da Gama. “But I have been impressed by their performance despite the lack of experience. We will continue working hard and learn every day.” He reckons they will be a better side next season “if God helps us stay (in the top flight). “We have drawn against a team that have been in the PSL for years,” he said. “We are still finding our feet and some players are taking longer, but they will get there soon.” The draw leaves them in the middle of the table with 16 points from 13 games before their last clash of the year against Da Gama’s former club, Bloemfontein Celtic, at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium on Monday. Da Gama singled out goalkeeper Marlon Heugh as one of the players who was outstanding on the night. The 28-year-old was at his best despite conceding two goals, saving a penalty kick by the bulky Mohammed Anas with 15 minutes remaining on the clock. “Marlon was absolutely fantastic,” said the Highlands head coach.
