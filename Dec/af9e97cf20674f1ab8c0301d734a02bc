THE funky, versatile duo have fused trap with kwaito, a bit of jazz here and there, and came up with a unique sound. Their latest hit song, Sohamba Ngo Seven, pays tribute to the late Brenda Fassie’s 90s hit, Kuyoze Kuyovalwa. Stay Fresh’s Tabiso “Sense” Klass (26) and Sive “Ceezy” Tini (24) said it was important for them to honour artists who put Mzansi music on the map. “We listen to a lot of old school music and are highly influenced by the Brenda’s music,” said Sense. “Sohamba Ngo Seven is a fun party song about having a good time and spreading positive vibes,” said Ceezy. The pair want to do anything that helps keep them grounded. “We’re not worried about competing with anyone else,’’ said Ceezy. “Our sound is unique. As long as we remain true to who we are, we’ll always win. “Our sound is influenced by hip hop, but we’re not trying to be too American. We stay in our lane.” The Queenstown-based musicians have come a long way. “We’re still based here as we want to help empower other youngsters,” said Ceezy. “Many artists make it and forget where they come from. “For us, charity begins at home.” The Stay Fresh team will launch the video for Sohamba Ngo Seven this festiveseason.
