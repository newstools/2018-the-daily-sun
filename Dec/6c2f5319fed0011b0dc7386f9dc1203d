SOME of Mzansi’s most recognisable faces have come out in support of the 16 Days of Activism For No Violence Against women and children, by posting their 16 seconds of silence videos. Sports presenter Thomas Mlambo and Metro FM’s drive time show host Mo Flava have reached out to the men to support the cause and encouraged them to stand with them in solidarity to help bring an end to this scourge. Thomas captioned his video: “I challenge all South African men to join the movement. There is#NoExcuse for women abuse. Stand in solidarity with Champion Men, who move with @BlackLabel to help end gender-based violence in SA. Show you are with us too”. Meanwhile, Mo’s captioned reads: 1095 woman are killed every year at the hands of their partner. There is no excuse for women abuse. Take a moment.
