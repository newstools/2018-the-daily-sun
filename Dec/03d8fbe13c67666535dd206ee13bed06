SO YOU have written all your matric exams, but now for you the dreaded wait has started. You may be wondering: “What if I failed?” Dr Gillian Mooney, education expert and dean of academic development and support at The Independent Institute of Education, said: “Instead of stressing, you must focus on what you can control, not your exam results which are out of your control. Focus on what you can do.” If you failed - Write supplementary examinations next year; - Send papers for either a re-mark or re-check; - Return to school and re-register for matric; - Register at another school to complete matric; or - Complete matric via distance learning. If you scraped through - Send your papers in for a re-assessment; or - Enrol in a higher education institution that offers a diploma that lets you access where you can study for a degree. If you get an unimpressive pass - Re-write the subjects you need for better marks; or - There are many places of education that offer accredited degrees but do not look as prestigious on a CV. Don’t sweat it. Enrol to study for a degree and if it is still important to you later on, get your honours or masters at the place of your choice. It’s all ‘A’ for you! - Great results open up lots of options so don’t grab the closest one. Did you miss out on bursaries for this year? Mark down the ones you liked so you can apply for them when they reopen again. If you did not get into where you wanted this year, you should re-apply as soon as you can. Find out more about the career you want by asking if you can work there as an intern – the reality might change your mind. - You can also spend a gap year working and saving or study a short-course diploma or two. “It does not matter what you think about now; you will only know for sure next year. “Rather relax and enjoy the holidays. Stop stressing over imaginary problems now. You can start working on your problems in the new year.”
