Maritzburg United have parted ways with Coach Fadlu Davids, the club confirmed on Monday. “Maritzburg United can confirm that coach Fadlu Davids has left the club,” the club announced in a statement. “We would like to thank Davids for his contribution to the club and wish him success in his future endeavors. “An announcement on a new head coach will be made in due time.Once again the club would like to reiterate it’s commitment to the fans and its stakeholders.” The writing was on the wall for Davids who was unable to replicate last season’s exploits with the KZN club. Davids led Maritzburg to a record fourth place finish on the Absa Premiership table last season, reaching the club's first ever cup final in the form of Nedbank Cup which they lost to Free State Stars. However, he has found the going a bit tougher this season. In 17 games the club played this season in all competitions, Maritzburg have only won two, lost seven and drew eight matches. They currently languish at the bottom of the table with 11 points.
