IN 2011, Prophet Paseka "Mboro" Motsoeneng was arrested by the cops in Bedfordview. And today, cops must pay him a lot of money for arresting him. The High Court in Pretoria ordered cops to pay the Incredible Happenings Ministries leader R100 000 plus 15% interest from 2014 when the summons was issued. Mboro was detained for 11 hours with his three bodyguards at the Germiston Cop Shop in 2011. He told the Sowetan that he would use some of the money from the payment to help the people of Alexandra who were left homeless recently after a fire raged through the neighbourhood. Mboro said he and his three bodyguards were bust at a shopping complex in Befordview, Ekurhuleni, for allegedly being in possession of unlawful firearms. He said only two of his guards had weapons and they were licensed. He filed a lawsuit only in 2014 saying his arrest harmed his reputation and caused him physical and emotional suffering. Mboro previously told Daily Sun: “I was not in possession of a firearm. “I was pulled by my private parts, hit with fists, called a fake prophet, sworn at and thrown inside the van. People at the mall and motorists driving by were looking at us. It was very traumatic.” Mboro said he spent a night in a jail cell and was mocked by the police. “I was later released as they were at fault.” Mboro said the incident brought shame to him as he was a public figure. He said he suffered backaches and headaches because of the harassment. “People were talking about it. There were placards, posters and headlines about my arrest,” he said.
