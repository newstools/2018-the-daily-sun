RESIDENTS have been advised to save water as Gauteng will be experiencing shortages. Rand Water said there will be an interruption in the province’s water supply. Spokesman Justice Mohale told Daily Sun they were urging consumers to use water sparingly during this difficult time. “We have been hit by an electrical problem at Zuikerbosch plant, and that has affected pumping at the Palmiet pumping station.” He said the areas that would be affected by these problems are high-lying areas such as Tshwane, Ekurhuleni and the City of Joburg, including Johannesburg south and Joburg east, Sandton and Midrand. Mohale said they have had to reduce the flow of water due to the problem. He said their technicians were hard at work trying to sort out the problem. Lenasia community leader Yusef Ahmed encouraged people to save water as he did not know when the situation would be back to normal.this problem will be fixed. He said the cause of the water shortage was that the Rand Water’s Palmiet Pumping Station currently was not working. “We do not know when this problem will end but urge people to please use water wisely,” said Ahmed. Ahmed said the pumping station was experiencing electrical problems and the system was at a critically low level. “The Klipriviersberg reservoir is at below 20%. “They have to intensify restrictions on the network to help alleviate pressure on the reduced capacity,” he said. Yusef said the affected areas were the City of Johannesburg including Johannesburg south and Joburg east, Sandton and Midrand, City of Tshwane and Ekurhuleni. “Rand Water, along with the municipalities, will keep consumers informed of developments on this matter,” said Yusef. “People need to make sure they must check faucets (taps), toilets and pipes for leaks, turn the faucets off when brushing their teeth or shaving and install water-saving shower heads. “They should take shorter showers and replace their washing machines with high-efficiency washers,” Ahmed said.
