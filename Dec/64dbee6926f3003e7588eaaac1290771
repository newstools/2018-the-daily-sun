FOUR families are in mourning after their children drowned in separate incidents in Limpopo. A two-year-old girl drowned in a tin bucket of water while playing at home in the Levubu area outside Thohoyandou. In another incident, two boys aged 15 drowned while swimming in a river at Ga-Mashashane outside Polokwane. A 14-year-old boy drowned while swimming at Lemana Dam near Elim, Makhado. Following the incidents, police in the province have urged parents to always look after their kids to avoid more reports of drowning. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said child safety should be strengthened at all times. He urged residents to be extremely careful around dams and rivers, especially during the rainy season. He said two boys, Lesetja Morifi (15) and Petrus Legodi (15) drowned in a river in Utjane Village at Ga-Mashashane outside Polokwane while swimming. “In Waterval outside Makhado, 14-year-old Ntwanano Maluleke drowned in a dam when swimming with his two friends. “Police were summoned and they started with search operations that led to the retrieval of the bodies,” he said. ‘The boys’ drowning follows the death of toddler Gundo Sidogi (2), whose life was cut shot after she fell into a bucket full of water at her home in Levubu last month.” Ngoepe added that police would investigate all the incidents. More than 14 people have already reportedly drowned in rivers and dams across Limpopo since the beginning of October.
