An 11-year-old girl has proved to be her brother's keeper after rescuing him from drowning in a pool in West Riding, Cape Town, on Friday. The 10-year-old boy became unresponsive in the pool and sank to the bottom of the pool. His sister helped him back to the surface and called for help. ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said that at approximately 12:30 paramedics arrived at the pool in a complex where they found bystanders with the child. He said that the boy was confused but in a stable condition. "Bystanders explained to paramedics that the children were in the pool when his sister noticed he did not come up from under the water. She called out to the adults who then rescued him from the water. They continued to explain that the boy was unresponsive and he only later regained consciousness after expelling water," said Vermaak. He said the boy was assessed at the scene and was then transported to the Red Cross Children's Hospital for further care.
