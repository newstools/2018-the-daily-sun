Mpumalanga-born actor, whose real name is Nicholas Nkuna who is well known for his role as Sakhile on Skeem-Saam seems to be in a money battle. Nkuna allegedly owes Thabiso Tshabalala a lump some of money for a service that was rendered in 2017 and is yet to settle the debt. Tshabalala says that he managed Nicholas Nkuna and his career since early 2017 and Nkuna hadn’t made a single payment for services rendered. He was sent an invoice with numerous payment reminders and was even given the option of a payment arrangement. "He agreed to the payment agreement but no payment was received. I eventually told him that all future work would cease until payment was received. He then went around telling clients that I had disappeared and that’s why we weren’t working together." Thabiso tweeted. Nicksoul is said to have tried to make contact after Thabiso had tweeted about the matter and accusing him of being desperate and that he tweeted that because he is looking for fame among other things. Daily Sun is in possession of the Voice recordings of a call between Nicholas and Thabiso where he is admitting that he owes him. He can be heard on the call recording saying that "... I said Thabiso I've been waiting for money and I am going to pay you your money before the installments conversation." "I said I will pay you before the end of December."
