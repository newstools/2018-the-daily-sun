BE warned, Cyril Ramaphosa. I’m coming for you! This was the warning from former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng at the launch of his new political movement yesterday. “I’m not contesting political parties but Cyril Ramaphosa. I want to be the next president,” said Motsoeneg. He said should he meet Ramaphosa, he would ask him how he got to be a billionaire in such a short space of time, and who gave him the money. The new organisation, African Content Movement, was launched in Milpark, Joburg. Motsoeneng said the ANC had said Jacob Zuma was a liability but were using him in election campaigns. He warned: “Msholozi, I’m coming for you, too. I’m going to take Msholozi on. I’m ready for him!” He said he agreed to be a part of this movement only if he was going to be the president because, “I love power!” He said he preferred to call it a movement rather than a political party. “The new animal called ACM will put Africans first. We won’t compromise at all on that,” he said. “Africans are the majority in South Africa. The power is in your hands. “As long as the economy is not in your hands and you’re workers, you’re in trouble.” ACM chairman Ally Mosina pleaded with followers not to get into the culture of burning clinics, schools and other government buildings. Motsoeneng said should his party win, it would move away from handing out grants. “The culture of giving people grants creates a lazy nation. People need to be given opportunities,” he said. He also said democracy would be “controlled”. In his party, and as president, he would have the final say. He also said when he gets a parliamentary seat, “because that’s certain”, he would use a bicycle and not surround himself with bodyguards.
