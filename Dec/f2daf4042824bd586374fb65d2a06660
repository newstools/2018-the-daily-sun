PENCILS have been sharpened! Belts have been safely tightened... Now it is time for local cruiserweight sensations – Thabiso “The Rock” Mchunu and Thomas “Tommy Gun” Oosthuizen – to live their words in their second clash at Emperors Palace tomorrow night. Their much-anticipated grudge rematch will be the main attraction in a six bout boxing extravaganza themed “Repeat or Revenge”. The Mchunu-Oosthuizen “rematch” was ordered by Golden Gloves boss Rodney Berman after Mchunu’s camp was not satisfied with the outcome, which saw Oosthuizen’s hand being raised as triumphant. A winner between the two talented pugilists will challenge Kevin “Two Guns” Lerena’s for the IBO world cruiserweight title. If they were to be judged on their verbal punches during their pre-medicals during the week, boxing fans are in for a treat. Mchunu, who was dethroned his SA and ABU titles, said he expects Oosthuizen to run around the ring, but the sleek Oosthuizen threatened to chop his opponents’ head if he jumps on him. “There will be no different approach from the previous encounter,” said Oosthuizen. “I expect to win this one easily, like I did with the first. This time I had more time in the gym, I’m feeling more established and good. I have trained hard. “I’m ready to fight. I’m hoping that he is ready too. I know he is going try to jump on me and that will expose him.” Throwing in a counter punch, the KwaZulu Natal-born Mchunu, who believes he won the first contest, said he expects to win convincingly. Victory is of importance for the Mdantsane boxing star as it would propel his promising boxing career to greater heights. The former IBF world lightweight champion is expected to test Mbenge’s character before being presented to the American public. In the middleweight division, a seasoned fighter Walter Dlamini is expected to continue with his fine form when he lock horns with Wade Groth for WBA Pan African and SA titles.
