THE Thekos are shocked and confused after the murder of one of their family members early on Tuesday morning. Alex Theko (27) was gunned down at home in Kagisanong View in Kgabalatsane, North West. His mum, Bertha Theko (47), said she was at church when a neighbour called her to say there was a body in her yard. “When I got there, I found my son lying dead in a pool of blood,” she said. “It doesn’t look as if they wanted to rob him. It looks as if they were chasing him, because there is blood between the shack and the yard where we found him. “All I know is he loved people and people loved him back. Our neighbours are as confused as I am. “Everything in the house, including his cellphones, were still in the house. “This shows they just wanted him dead because they did not take anything,” she said. Community leader Khatedi Molamodi (46) said crime has become a big problem in their area. “Many people have been shot dead. Gunshots are always fired and the culprits are roaming around the area while our people are being buried.” Colonel Adele Myburgh said the body of a 27-year-old man was found with a bullet wound in his upper body on Wednesday in Kagisanong section, Hebron. A murder case has been opened and investigations continue.
