GLEBELANDS gunman Mawethu Maquthu was sentenced to 31 years
in jail. The Durban Regional Court sentenced Maquthu to 15 years in
jail for murder, five years on two counts of attempted murder, five years for
possession of ammunition, five years for possession of unlicensed firearm and
12 months for possession of a stolen property. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the count of
murder and attempted murder will run concurrently. His co-accused Sthembiso Mbanjwa (43) was sentenced to five
years imprisonment for attempted murder. They were also declared unfit to
possess firearms. “Their sentence follows an exhaustive trial where the court
heard how they killed and maimed residents at the Glebelands Hostel in Umlazi
during June 2017. It is alleged on 4 June 2017, Msizi Makhoba (25), was at the
hostel when he was shot and killed by a man who accused him of making a noise
by hooting. He sustained a gunshot wound to the head and he later died
in hospital. His 27-year-old friend was also shot on his leg during the
shooting,” Gwala said. Maquthu was also linked to another case of attempted murder
he committed with his co-accused Mbanjwa at Glebelands Hostel on 9 June 2017. Gwala said it is alleged that the victim was allegedly shot
and wounded while at the hostel. During Maquthu’s arrest he was found in possession of a
stolen vehicle. The vehicle was stolen in the Umbilo area on 23 April 2017.
