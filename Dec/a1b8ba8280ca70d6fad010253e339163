NOT long ago residents of Magwaleni squatter camp, in Worcester’s Zwelethemba kasi in Cape Town, used plastic bags to relieve themselves. That was until the People’s Paperpublished their story on 1 November. They said most people dumped plastic bags near their shacks and that this would make them sick. When the SunTeam visited the area again at the weekend, they were no longer using plastic bags. Councillor Moses Mangali said the municipality had delivered mobile toilets on Thursday. “We got more than 20 toilets for Magwaleni. “We’re happy they won’t use plastic bags anymore.” He said they’d deliver five more toilets soon. “The five toilets will be placed in open spaces so no one has to use plastic or relieve themselves in the bushes.” “The squatters have been struggling for too long, and using plastic bags to relieve yourself is very bad.” Even though the community got the toilets, Mangali said the area still lacked service delivery. “I’m happy for the squatters. But we wanted a more permanent solution because now 10 houses share one toilet. We hope for more positive change soon,” said Mangali. Zukhanye Ncekiso (48) was happy with the toilets. “We’ll enjoy Christmas like other people,” he said. “We’re relieved that we won’t use plastics bags anymore. “We’re also grateful to Daily Sun because after the paper published the story, we got toilets.” Another resident, Unathi Nyalambisa (27), said the toilets brought back their dignity because the situation was very bad. “We can’t believe we finally got toilets. Now we can safely relieve ourselves in toilets.”
