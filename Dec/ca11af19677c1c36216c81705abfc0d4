FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s Twitter account is growing at a very fast pace. But it seems he is attracting more haters than admirers. He recently tweeted: “Let us remind South Africans about the historic decision taken by the country to introduce free higher education for students. “We thank all South Africans who made it possible. We thank thse students, academics and those who worked hand in hand in making this dream a reality.” But some of the responses were very nasty. @AdvNgcukaitobi wrote: “On 15 August 2016, we went to the Union Buildings to give you our memo. You refused to meet us and accept our memo.” @NtlatlapaBokang wrote: “We all know you did it for nefarious purposes. You thought it was going to aid your former wife to win the ANC elections.” @MouldMagic said: “Free education means nothing if you destroyed the economy and people can’t find jobs.” However, many users said Zuma seemed to be a very happy man. “He is pretty much enjoying his retirement,” said @MzoxoloMtolo. This after Zuma posted two videos on his account. In one video, he is playing soccer with kids. He runs with them and calls for them to pass to him. In the other video, he is singing with men and wearing traditional attire. @TeeKay wrote: “I’m going to Nkandla to live with ubaba and be happy like him in 2019. It was never boring when he was the president.”
