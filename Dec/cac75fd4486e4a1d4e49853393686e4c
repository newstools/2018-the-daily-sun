Two Vodacom stores were attacked and damaged at Mall of the North in Polokwane and Makhado in Limpopo. The attacks were allegedly carried out by a group of people calling themselves EFF members and supporters. This is after EFF leaders were described as "corrupters of democracy" during a speech at an event sponsored by Vodacom. Vodacom said the sentiments were not its own. On Sunday night,Â Business Insider reported that Vodacom has confirmed that some of its stores will be closed at least on Monday. "Certain stores, including Mall of the North, will remain closed until further notice. The safety and security of customers and franchise staff remains paramount," spokesperson Byron Kennedy told Business Insider South Africa. The Business Insider further reported that In Port Elizabeth, police intervened after an EFF group reportedly insisted that a store at The Bridge shopping centre should be close.
