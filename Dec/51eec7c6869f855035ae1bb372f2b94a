FORMER African National Congress (ANC) Treasurer General
Mendi Msimang has died. The ANC said as an organisation they are in shock at the
passing of an unwavering revolutionary and sent their condolences to the
children, grandchildren and the extended family. “Uncle Mendi, as he was fondly known, was a long-serving
member of the ANC, having cut his wisdom teeth along with cde Walter Sisulu and
others in the ANC Youth League as a student,” National Spokesperson Pule Mabe
said. Msimang was elected to the first democratic parliament in
1994, serving as the first Chairperson of the ANC Caucus. He was appointed as High Commissioner of South Africa to the
UK from 1995-1998. In 1997, Mendi Msimang was elected as Treasurer General of
the ANC at the Mafikeng National Conference, a position he served in until
2007. Mabe said Msimang, remained a relentless and calm activist,
and patriot who despite his advanced age continued to serve the country and the
ANC, as a member of the ANC Integrity Commission appointed in 2013 and a member
of the Advisory Board on National Orders.
