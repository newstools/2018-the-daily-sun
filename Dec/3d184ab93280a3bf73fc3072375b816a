EFF Limpopo chairman Jossey Buthane has been labelled a liar after accusing the Mogalakwena Local Municipality of withdrawing R100 million from the collapsed VBS Mutual Bank. Mogalakwena mayor Andrina Matsemela said the municipality had never invested money with the bank. But Buthane said he would not keep quiet unless they told him where they had placed the R100 million after withdrawing it from VBS. He said the money was not in the municipal bank account and demanded to know its whereabouts. “You’re seriously disrespecting us. I will not keep quiet until you tell me where you’ve taken the R100 million withdrawn by Mogalakwena municipality from VBS bank.” Matsemela insisted the municipality never invested with VBS and had no intentions of doing so. “We will escalate this matter to our corporate department to seek legal advice,” she told the People’s Paper. “It was wrong of a leader to post baseless allegations about the municipality. “If indeed Buthane is so sure about this joke or lie, we advise and encourage him – or anyone who might have fed him the lies – to bring tangible evidence forward.” She said the municipality’s name was being dragged continuously through the mud by people who had intentions to mislead the public or wanted to score cheap political points.
