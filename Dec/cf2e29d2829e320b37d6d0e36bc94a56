BODIES are piling up at funeral parlours as municipal workers refuse to dig graves. Over the weekend two cemeteries were locked in Buffalo City municipality. Mandla Makinana of Makinana Funeral Parlour told Daily Sun many corpses were returned to the fridges because of the strike. Water and electricity are the main problems: some residents have not had services for two weeks and rubbish is piling up in the streets. “If the strike continues, funeral parlours are going to run out of space,” said Makinana. Ntsiki April from Mdantsane said her brother, Lamla April, had been in the mortuary for nearly a month. “We could not bury him last Saturday because of the strike. Even last week, his body was already going off.” Abongile Nayo (30) from Nayo Funeral Directors said they had to come back without burying a person at Haven Hills cemetery. She said they were worried that the bodies in their cold rooms would decompose. Buffalo City Metro has appealed to Samwu workers to meet them halfway as the strike was in its third week. On Monday temporary workers were allegedly forced out of their work stations by angry striking workers in East London. Mayoral spokesman Luzuko Buku said: “Temporary workers are digging graves.” Buku said at a Mdantsane cemetery there was padlock on the gate which they managed to cut. “There were delays in burial services,” he said.
