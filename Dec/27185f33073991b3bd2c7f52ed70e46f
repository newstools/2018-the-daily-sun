A BUS service has taken a strong action against a bus
driver filmed dangerously overtaking. IN the video, the bus driver is seen overtaking two truck
on a barrier line where the road also curves. Intercape management confirmed the incident. The coach was on its way from Cape Town to Durban. Arrive Alive reports that the driver admitted that he was
wrong in his actions. He was immediately suspended pending a disciplinary
hearing. Charges again the driver will be opened at the SAP in
Durban for recklessness and negligent driving. The driver started working for the bus service since 2
August 2016. The management of Intercape can assure the public of
Southern Africa that this is not the standard of service and zero tolerance
will be enforced. Intercape regrets and apologies for the unfortunate
incident.
