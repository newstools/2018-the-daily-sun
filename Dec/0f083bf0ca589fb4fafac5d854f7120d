The world of TV presenting looks glamorous and simple, but many are not aware of the hard work that goes into preparing the shows. That is why Tshepiso Shikwambane (27) and Mbali Malinga (28), who both hold BA honours degrees in dramatic arts from Wits, teach talented young people the basics of acting and TV presenting. They host workshops with their company, PhandiCraft, which was founded in 2016. The two said they met while studying at Wits. Tshepiso told SunBuzz: “This is my passion and I love working with fresh talent as I have experience in youth television. I absolutely love what I do, as I get to express who I am.” She said the reason they did the workshops was that many people had an interest in the entertainment industry but did not know much about it. Tshepiso said they host the workshops at various schools around Joburg. She said their aim was to enhance children’s confidence, creativity and imagination. Mbali said they had faced many challenges in the industry and wanted young people to learn from their mistakes. “We thought this would be the perfect way to give back the knowledge we have acquired over the years.” Mbali said the response has been always amazing. “The best part of the workshops is that the attendees are given platforms to show their talents and exercise the tools given to them. “I believe they can break boundaries on their own if they realise their potential.”
