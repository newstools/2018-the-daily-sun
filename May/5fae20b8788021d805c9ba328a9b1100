MANY may know her for her role as MaMlambo on Uzalo, where she plays a gossiper and prophetess. What fans of this popular show do not know is that she plays a middle-aged woman but is much younger. Gugu Gumede (27) was born and raised in Ulundi, northern KZN. She is a rural girl at heart, raised by a single mum: NFP leader Zanele Magwaza-Msibi. Many viewers will remember her American accent, playing Mandisa on Generations. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said she had always wanted  to act. She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Los Angeles. She got her acting breakthrough when she landed the role on Generations. “It was amazing acting alongside Menzi Ngubane as it was one of my dreams,” she said. “I act for the passion, not for the fame.” She said when she got the role her friend reminded her how she had talked about being on the soapie one day. “That is how we dream into the future,” she said. Gugu said when Uzalo was created, the producers noticed her and offered her the role of MaMlambo. She said when she looks back at her days at university she realises how far she has come. “I’m not where I want to be but I’m extremely grateful I’m not where I used to be. “I can say to everyone they must keep pushing until they get where they want to be,” she said. She said she spent her spare time with her puppy, Harvey. “I’m a home body, but I also love improving my skills. “When I have time I usually go and watch shows to learn my craft.” Gugu bragged about her love for cooking. “I am the best cook you will ever meet. I spend a lot of time in the kitchen,” she said.
