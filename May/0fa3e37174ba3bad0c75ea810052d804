PAMELLA Nano (42) from Asanda Village in Strand, Cape Town is grateful to her ancestors for saving her life. Her house was damaged by what witnesses describe as a witch’s tornado! Pamella said she escaped death because her ancestors “pushed” her out of harm’s way. Pamella told Daily Sun she was making a cup of coffee in her kitchen at about 6.50am on Monday. “I heard a noise like a low flying airplane. I was very surprised when I felt something pushing me back. Then the satellite dish and roof came out of nowhere and landed right where I had been standing moments before. “My ancestors pushed me out of the way. I thank them because they saved me from something evil that wanted to kill me,” she said. The shack next to Pamella’s house was badly damaged and the roof landed on Pamella’s neighbour’s house. Nobody knows where the roof and satellite dish came from! Sakhekile Nangani (38) saw wind, smoke and fire in a tornado. “We ran for our lives as it was coming fast. It wasn’t just a normal tornado, but a witch’s tornado.” The Nano family is busy fixing their roof with help from ward 85 DA chair, Sithembiso Weduwedu. Sangoma Dora Kheswa (55) said Pamella has a strong ancestor who protected her as the roof had been sent to kill her. She said Pamella should protect herself because if evil people tried to kill her and failed, they would almost certainly try again.
