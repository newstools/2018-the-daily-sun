PROPHET Mpikeleni Ndou’s bees are always abuzz with good advice. Thousands of the hardworking insects live in a hive right under the bed in his consulting room, guarding him and providing him with powerful visions. But lately, his bees have been alarmed and his visions have turned dark. The father of 10 with three wives, from Khumalo section in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni says bees have shown him that Mzansi is being swallowed by the soil! “Darkness then follows. People scream the screams of death, pleading for help.” He said each time he has the vision, he wakes up with a sore heart, as if what is happening is real. “I’ve ignored this vision for too long. Now my ancestors are angry. They told me I must pass on this message quickly or bad things will happen to me.” He said when he asked what the vision is about, his ancestors, through the bees told him the country is about to face big difficulties. “They told me there is a need for all the kings to come together and put things back in order by making sure cultures are practised thoroughly,” he said. Mpikeleni said if the kings won’t listen, he fears the vision will come true. “I’ve been with my bees for 10 years now. Every time they give a warning and it’s not listened to, really bad things happen,” he said. Mpikeleni said his bees have been helping him heal people. “They are my ancestors. They alert me to things happening, good or bad.” The prophet told the People’s Paper the swarm of bees came into his shack in 2008 and made their home under his bed. “I tried to chase them away but my ancestors said I should leave them alone.” Since then, they have been his guardians. He sleeps on the bed every now and then, especially when he wants to connect with the ancestors, but he also has another shack where his family lives.
