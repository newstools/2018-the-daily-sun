I still haven't mastered the art of how to put together a boyfriend jean outfit and every time I have to I just peep in to Thuli Mola's Instagram account. Boyfriend jeans are one of the trends that never really seem to fade away and investing in a good pair of boyfriend jeans won't be a total waste. This is a look that if you get wrong you look ridiculous but styled correctly, you'll look amazingly chic and so cool. Want to learn how to rock this look perfectly? Well Thuli has a couple of looks that can help. Thuli Mola is a self-taught celebrity stylist and a founder of a clothing brand called Style Alert and below are some of her looks that will help you navigate this trendy style without looking silly. Here are a few ways to look great and work with what you might already own: 1. With an over sized Denim Shirt This denim on denim look never goes out of style. You can either tuck in the shirt or wear in with a nice preferred t-shirt/croptop inside and leave the shirt unbuttoned like below. You can pair this look with strapped heels or nice ankle boots to give it an urge. 2. The kimono look This a a tricky look but if you have the colours that coordinate and the right Kimono size you can pull this one off. 3. Waist Tied with shirt or jacket This cheecky look paired with the right shoes can be so bomb. You can even pull it off to the more boyfriend look with a pair of Timbs or DR Martins. 4. With the white shirt This is the look that looks good on everyone when done right. Make sure the Shirt is a bit over sized and you can either tuck it in or leave one side out if not all. 5. The biker look Toughen up this look with a slim biker leather jacket – if you want to add some feminine touches, wear bright heels or just keep it down with white simple sneakers or sliver loafers as above. 6. Cardigan pairing with pumps 7. Dramatic off the shoulder look This look can be pulled off with a cropped baloon off the shoulder top and a pair of black strapy heels.
