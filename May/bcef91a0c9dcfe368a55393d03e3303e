POLOKWANE City head coach Bernard Molekwa has hailed striker Rodney “Rama-G” Ramagalela for representing them well and being counted among the best this season. The bulky striker will share the Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot award with Mamelodi Sundowns star Percy Tau after both rattled the back of the net 11 times in the 2017-18 Absa Premiership season. “I am impressed with his performance this season,” Molekwa said after saving the Limpopo club from competing in the promotion/relegation mini-league play-offs. “Rama is a disciplined and hard-working player, and I believe he deserves this achievement. We are a small club with minimal resources compared to big clubs like Sundowns, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. It’s great to have your player being one of the leading scorers, it makes you feel like a winner too.” The 40-year-old mentor said he hoped the 29-year-old former Black Leopards and Sundowns player would remain with the Limpopo side for next season. “As a coach you would like to keep all your best players,” he said. “But we are aware that some teams are attempting to lure him to their clubs, enticing him with fat cheques, after the good season he had.” He added that this had been a disappointing season for them: “Our aim was to finish in the top eight again but it was not meant to be. The good thing is we managed to retain our PSL status. We have to learn from our mistakes next season. I am sure we will return a better team next season.”
