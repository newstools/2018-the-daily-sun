Kaizer Chiefs owner Kaizer Motaung senior’s wife, Julegka, has survived a traumatic experience. This after the soccer bigwig’s wife was hijacked and robbed of items valued at R2,5 million. The incident occurred inside the yard of their family home in Bryanston, north of Jozi. Police are investigating a case of carjacking, robbery and the pointing of a firearm at the Randburg Police Station. This follows another incident in which the queen of the soccer family almost lost her life last year. According a police statement seen by SunTeam, Julegka was driving a white Range Rover. Read the statement, in part: “As she opened the garage door, she was approached by three black males, and one of them pointed a firearm at her.” The statement reveals the thugs also got away with jewellery and a handbag with R18 000 in cash. “They also demanded her car keys and instructed her to open the gate. “One of them got into her car and they drove off. “The suspects were driving an unknown white vehicle. No shots were fired. No injuries. Value R2 500 000.” The SunTeam was informed Julegka was allegedly followed until she got home. Her vehicle was recovered by police at the Hilton Hotel in Sandton. Police spokesperson Makgowanyana Maja confirmed that the investigation is continuing. “No one has been arrested yet, only the vehicle has been recovered,” he said. Kaizer Chiefs spokesperson Vinna Maphosa refused to comment. “I don’t comment on personal matters,” he said. Both Kaizer Motaung Snr and his wife Julegka could not be reached for comment.
