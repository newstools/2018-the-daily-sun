"You can't stop crime by committing crime." These are the words of Limpopo's top cop general Ledwaba
following mob killing in the province. Limpopo said are looking for a group of community members
believed to be behind the killing of man in his twenties in Vondwe village
outside Thohoyandou. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said that a
passerby made a gruesome discovery of the half burnt body of a young man and
notified the police who responded immediately and processed the crime scene
accordingly. He said the preliminary investigations have also revealed
that the deceased is a resident of the same village and he is accused of being
one of the suspects involved in a series of crimes in and around the area. The deceased was identified as 26-year-old Ronewa Siliga. Ngoepe said the motive behind the killing is still not
clear so far but the investigations will tell upon completion as they are still
unfolding. The suspects involved in this incident are still unknown
and there is no arrest yet. Anyone who knows who the suspects are on both incidents,
may contact the nearest Police Station or the crime stop number 0860010111 or
the crime line sms 32211. Members of the community are once more advised and warned
to stop and refrain from this irresponsible acts because they continue to
destroy the hard earned community policing spirit which still exists around the
Province. "You cannot combat crime by committing crime because
there is no justifiable reason to attack or kill a person suspected of being
involved in criminal activities. Community members who are still perpetrating
this type of acts are going to be dealt with mercilessly and without
compromise," concluded Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke LedwabaÂ .
