ZIMELE Tshangase (41) believes the man who stabbed his wife to death should rot in jail. “He doesn’t deserve to live. How could he kill her like that?” he said. His wife Nomvano (28) was brutally murdered in Asanda Village Strand on Friday. Nomvano was apparently trying to stop her neighbour (34) from assaulting his friend when the man turned on her. Her friend Khanya Kibiti (29) was also attacked. “My friend was trying to stop the fight when the neighbour klapped her,” said Khanya. “We stopped them and thought it was over and went home. “After a few minutes we heard people saying we must run, and when we looked back we saw the neighbour coming at us with a sharp object.” She managed to run away after being stabbed in the hand. Nomvano was stabbed several times in the body. “Nomvano begged the man to stop, but he wouldn’t,” Khanya told Daily Sun. Zimele was called to the scene by his children. “When I arrived I found my wife lying in a pool of blood. She’d been stabbed several times. “We called the police and ambulance, but they took time to arrive. “We then asked someone with a car to transport us to hospital.” Doctors declared his wife dead when they got to hospital. “My wife was killed for no reason,” he said. Lwandle police spokesman Sergeant Mothokozi Gama said a suspect was arrested and appeared in court on Monday. The case was postponed to today for a bail application.
