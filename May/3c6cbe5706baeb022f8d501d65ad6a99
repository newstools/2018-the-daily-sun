WHEN Sheila Dlabu attended a tombstone unveiling at a neighbour’s house on Saturday morning, no one knew it was to be her last day on earth. The 38-year-old from Hostel One kasi in Mangaung had chosen her favourite dress for the ceremony. After the ceremony she decided to go home and was about to cross the street when she was hit by a car. Sheila’s aunt, Lydia Dlabu (57), told Daily Sun: “Sheila was neatly dressed when she attended the tombstone unveiling. “The next thing, I received a call from a neighbour to say Sheila had been killed by a car. “When I arrived at the scene her body was lying next to the car that ran her over.” Lydia said the owner of the car was reversing after receiving a call telling him some of the workers renovating his house had been bitten by a dog. “It seems he reversed unaware that someone was behind the car, and he ran her over,” said devastated Lydia. She said Sheila’s son tried to stop the driver, but it was too late. “I feel bad about what happened. “Sheila was friendly to everyone and people loved her because she liked to joke,” Lydia told the People’s Paper. A neighbour said she was with Sheila at the unveiling ceremony. “She said she was feeling tired and was going home to rest,” said the neighbour. “After a few minutes, I heard people screaming and others crying. “When I got to the scene I noticed her by the clothes she was wearing.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said a case of culpable homicide had been opened.
