THE Red Location Museum in Masangwana Village, Port Elizabeth has been turned into a tavern by kasi youths. The museum was closed by angry residents in October 2013 after the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality allegedly failed to fix their RDP houses. The municipality proposed to demolish their crumbling RDPs and replace them with better structures, but the residents refused. On Friday afternoon, the SunTeam was shocked to find seven young men drinking booze in the museum. Ndyebo Mbambani, a PAC leader in the area, told Daily Sun: “We have been told young people are drinking liquor in our museum. “We didn’t close the museum for it to be turned into a shebeen. “It seems the youngsters are working with the security guards because they allow them to use this place as a drinking place. “It’s strange because the museum is always locked and you can’t access it without the help of the guards.” An angry resident (32) told the People’s Paper: “The guards often invite their friends to the museum. They braai meat and drink booze in the space. This is unacceptable and something must be done. These people have turned our museum into a tavern.” Mayoral spokesman Sibongile Dimbaza said: “We are disturbed by what is happening. The museum will not be opened soon because we are still talking to the residents about it.”
