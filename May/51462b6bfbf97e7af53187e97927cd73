THE struggle
for a shorter workday for the working class dates back to the 1800s. It's reported
that on 7 October 1884, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions, in
the United States of America and Canada resolved that eight hours should
constitute a legal day's labour as of 01 May 1886. According to SA
History, the Federation also recommended to workers organisations under their
jurisdiction that they abide by this resolution by the said date and since then
May Day has been celebrated on 01 May annually. The first
recorded celebration of May Day in South Africa is reported by Ray Alexander to
have taken place in 1895 which was organised by the Johannesburg District
Trades Council. The next
occasion was the visit of British labour and socialist leader Tom Mann, who
came to South Africa in 1910. Mann, like
Kier Hardie before him, criticized the South African Labour Party (SALP) for
its neglect of African workers, and urged the white labour movement to begin to
think seriously of organising among African workers. His visit
inspired a mood of international worker solidarity and culminated in a mass May
Day procession in which all sections of the labour movement participated.
