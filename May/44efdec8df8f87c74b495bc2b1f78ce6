FEAR gripped Tshwane on Tuesday evening when an ANC councillor was shot dead. Siphiwe Montlha was murdered in front of his gate at extension 4 in Soshanguve after attending a zone meeting. His murder left everyone involved in politics in the area shocked and afraid. In a statement, ANC regional spokesman Teboho Joala said Montlha’s death would leave a big hole in the hearts of everyone who had worked with him. “I pray to God to give us all strength and courage to pull through this difficult time,” he said. Joala said Montlha served as a district chairman of the Young Communist League, secretary of the subdistrict of the SACP, and as ANC branch secretary. “As the ANC, we send our sincere and deepest condolences to his family and friends. “We ask the entire community of Tshwane and the congress movement to pray for his wife and children as they grieve,” he said. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said police were investigating cases of murder and attempted murder. DA Gauteng North regional chairman Abel Tau condemned the murder. “We convey our condolences to the ANC, friends and family of Councillor Monthla during this difficult time,” he said. “We call on cops to urgently institute a full investigation into this senseless attack and ensure all those responsible are arrested. Tau said the SAPS needed to take responsibility and ensure the safety of all citizens. “This latest incident brings the number of political killings in the area to three, following the killing of two other ANC councillors in 2006,” said Tau.
