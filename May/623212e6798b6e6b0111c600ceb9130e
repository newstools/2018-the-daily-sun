FREE State Stars boss Rantsi Mokoena is seething over constant speculation linking Luc Eymael with Kaizer Chiefs. For months the rumour mill has been in overdrive that Eymael was set to ditch Ea Lla Koto for a plum Amakhosi job. Stars have so far achieved relative success under Eymael, finishing sixth in the Absa Premiership and reaching the Nedbank Cup final. The Red Army are headed for Cape Town Stadium for their final showdown with Maritzburg United on Saturday. But the constant speculation hasn’t gone down well with Mokoena. “This narrative needs to stop!” said a visibly annoyed Mokoena. “It is unfair and it undermines this club. It almost suggests he is above Free State Stars, or that Stars don’t deserve a coach of his calibre. At the end of the day, we need to respect the fact that Luc is contracted to this club. “His availability should not be an issue because he is contracted. “This is a club with a rich history. But this narrative continues. Just like players, coaches come and go. Luc hasn’t signed a lifetime contract with us. But what we should be focusing on now is the cup final, the season we’ve had.” Mokoena, Stars general manager, went as far as to suggest the speculation brought instability in the team. To emphasise his point, Mokoena pointed to their winless seven-game run leading up to their 2-1 loss to Orlando Pirates in their last league match. “I don’t want to apportion blame to anyone. But we went seven games without a win, four losses and three draws. And if you trace it back, it’s since the story broke. It goes as far as disturbing not just himself but the players and the office. It has created a negative vibe within the team.” Eymael also cleared the air, saying he hadn’t received any concrete offer from anyone, including SuperSport United. He said: “I see people are saying after the Nedbank Cup I’ll be going to Chiefs. “But I have not been contacted by anyone. “And I’ll inform my bosses first, if I’m ever contacted.”
