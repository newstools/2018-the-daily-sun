One of the world’s biggest reality competitions, The Remix, is coming to Mzansi and SABC 1 is looking for new talent to be on the show. The channel is looking for DJs, producers and singers to join the record-smashing, global hit sensation that The Remix has become. According to SABC 1, here’s how it’ll all go down on the show: "Ten groups, each made up of a trio of a strong vocalist, DJ/Producer and musical performer of choice will compete head-to-head every week until only one group is left standing. The winners will then walk away with a fantastic cash prize. Groups will be tasked with creating a remix within a given theme or musical genre. Working together, they must create a unique sound and bring new flavour to existing local and international hits. All this, while doing justice to the original track. The groups will then perform their remix in front of a live studio audience and our star judges. They will be judged on the remix that they produce as well as the performance they give. The worst performance of the night will be eliminated." If you think your crew has what it takes to win then head over to the SABC 1 website to submit your contact form with a video clip. Entrants must be between the ages of 18 and 35 years old and entries will close at midnight on the 30th of May.
