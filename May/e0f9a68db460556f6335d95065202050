HIS CAR suddenly caught fire while it was parked next to the four-room house the victim is renting. This dramatic scene has left the owner of the luxury black Audi scratching his head. The man (28) from J section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, suspects foul play. “I don’t believe that the car caught fire on its own. I have no clue who may have done this. “However, this proves that I have enemies who hate me with a passion,” he said. The owner of the car woke up on Sunday to find a cloud of thick black smoke and his car on fire. He said he parked the car just after midnight on Saturday. “Some neighbours brought buckets of water to put out the fire but it was too strong.” One of the neighbours told Daily Sun: “A suspicious white Corolla was seen parking on the opposite side of the road. “Moments after the driver sped off, the car caught fire. “We suspect that the occupants of that car threw a petrol bomb at the parked car. “No one saw the occupants of the white vehicle.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of malicious damage to property was opened at KwaMashu Police Station for investigation.
