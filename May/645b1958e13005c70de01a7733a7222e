MBALI Mvungande is no longer a missing person! According to sources close to the investigation, the woman who went missing in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni is in hospital for various tests. Circumstances around her disappearance are still sketchy at the moment. Daily Sun ran the story on Wednesday, in which her family was pleading with the alleged kidnappers of their daughter to release her. According to police and her relatives, she was being held hostage by unidentified people in an unknown area. After her disappearance almost two weeks ago, shocking images of her were posted online and went viral. The photos, which apparently were from her kidnappers, showed Mbali in what looked like a shack, gagged with a black cloth in her mouth. No ransom demands were made. Yesterday the People’s Paper was alerted that Mbali had been brought to the Vosloorus cop shop. Cops are still investigating the circumstances around her disappearance, despite her reappearance. Gauteng provincial police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini confirmed that Mbali was no longer missing. “She came to the police station on Wednesday night accompanied by a relative,” said Dlamini. “At this stage we are still investigating a kidnapping case,” he said. Dlamini was unable to confirm reports that she had given birth and that her alleged kidnappers had released her and kept the baby, saying she would be taken to the doctor to confirm her pregnancy. “At this stage we do not know whether the woman was pregnant or not, but we are taking her to a doctor to verify if she was pregnant before she disappeared,” said Dlamini. “At the moment there is no evidence that she might have misled the cops. “If our investigations indicate anything else we will take it from there.”
