COMMUTERS watched in horror as a train travelling between the Heathfield and Retreat stations in Cape Town caught fire on Tuesday. One commuter said the fire was started by a group of smokers. “A fight broke out among them. Then we saw the flames. I am glad no one was injured or killed because of their recklessness,” he said. The incident left many commuters stranded. Ayola Magungqu (36) said: “People are using taxis to get to work and school, but some of us can’t afford to do that. “It’s not our fault that the smokers burned those carriages. We are suffering even though we do not smoke. Metrorail should have organised buses for us.” A taxi driver said the incident boosted their business. “We feel sorry for those who travel by train, but we are happy to be at their service,” he said. Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott said the fire completely destroyed two train carriages. Two other carriages suffered minor damage. “All the commuters were evacuated at Retreat Station at 8.51am. The over head power line was switched off to allow the fire brigade to extinguish the flames. “The train crew separated the burning carriages from the rest of the train to prevent further damage,” said Scott. Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker commended the train crew for separating the carriages. “Our employees know how vital every carriage is and will do everything in their power to prevent further loss of capacity,” said Walker. Fire and Rescue spokesman Theo Layne said two fire engines, one water tanker and one rescue vehicle went to the scene. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said: “A case of malicious damage to property has been opened.”
