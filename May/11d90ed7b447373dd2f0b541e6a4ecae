A 24-YEAR-OLD man appeared at Ngqeleni Magistrates Court yesterday. He allegedly raped a 71-year-old gogo in March at her home in Malungeni Village. Wearing a green hoodie, he seemed calm as he entered the packed courtroom. Angry residents came in large numbers to support the gogo, who bravely took a front row seat. She said all she wants is justice to be served. “I will never be the same person I was before this happened. “I miss my home but fear going there. I want this man to be heavily sentenced.” The gogo claimed that the accused knocked her door down and raped her in the dark after he switched off the electricity in another room. The case was postponed to 13 June at the regional court. Angry residents said they don’t want the accused to set foot in their village. Chief Hlumisa Madikizela said: “We want him to stay locked up. He has been doing bad things in our village and we don’t want him here. He has stock theft cases open at our traditional court.” The gogo’s niece (57) was angry, saying the family wants the matter to be finalised, so gogo can heal. “We don’t want the case to be drawn out as it will affect her health. Even the death sentence would serve as justice,” she said.
