SIBONGILE Mani, who went on an R800 000 spending spree with National Student Financial Aid Scheme money, should pay it back but not get a criminal record. This was the call of the student wing of the Forum 4 Service Delivery political party as they launched their “Hands off Sibongile Mani” campaign. Keoagile Motlagodisa, student wing secretary general of the party, said a legal expert was studying the case. Motlagodisa said there were no grounds to charge Sibongile without charging the relevant official who made the payment. “We don’t dispute that Sibongile should pay back the money, but without a criminal charge.” Mani made headlines when she received R14 million in her account from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme last year. The Walter Sisulu University accounting student was arrested on Tuesday and released yesterday on a warning after her court appearance.
