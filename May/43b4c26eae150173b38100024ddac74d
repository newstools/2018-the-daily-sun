FOR nearly 10 years, Daniel Phiri has been helping budding musicians get their foot in the door. Daniel, owner of Kushesh Creative Productions, is in the running for three Adara Awards at Gold Reef City in Joburg on 27 June. He’s been nominated in the business, entrepreneur, and young achiever of the year categories. “Whether or not I come back with an award, I will still see myself as a winner,” he said. “I’m grateful to my wife and business partner Palesa for her support. We help artists who’re struggling to find mainstream success.” One of his clients is hip hop artist Sick Vic. Daniel drew media attention to the salesperson-turned-musician and signed gospel artist Lufuno Nobula. He worked on Lufuno’s image and helped him access a number of media platforms. Daniel works with T Kells, a Malawian artist who’s redefining what it means to be a woman musician in Africa. “Solomon Lentswe, also known as Kingsoja, is another artist I took under my wing. “He was also a salesman. He mostly performs at big government events. “His songs have been played on local and international radio stations.”
