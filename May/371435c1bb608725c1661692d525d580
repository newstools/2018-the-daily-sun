CYRIL Ramaphosa, as ANC president, seemed pleased after his engagement with the Cosatu central executive committee yesterday. Ramaphosa, who was part of the meeting to strengthen alliance relations, told the media at Cosatu House in Braamfontein, Joburg, they had agreed as alliance partners they had to engage. “Even with issues where we may not see eye to eye, we should never have issues where the alliance is weakened,” he said. “We are a governing alliance that needs to deal with issues and lead our people as we campaign.” Ramaphosa said Cosatu raised a number of issues and agreed they were also going to make sure they embark on campaigns for important issues that affect people and the nation. Ramaphosa said: “Yes, they raised the issue of labour brokers. “They raised the issue of land and all those issues are going to be addressed. “The important thing is that we are strengthening the platform for us to engage.” He said they would discuss the issue of the coming job summit and they had agreed Cosatu would play a key role in the implementation of the national minimum wage. He said the coming elections were where the alliance needed to be united as they led the people towards realising the objectives of the national democratic revolution. Bheki Ntshalintshali, Cosatu general secretary, said the committee was happy that the president was able to find time to address them. “There were a number of issues we wanted to address with the president in terms of clarity. “It was a very open and robust engagement.”
