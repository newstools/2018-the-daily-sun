THE residents of Koster and Derby in North West who allegedly torched Kgetlengrivier mayor Kim Medupe’s house have been granted bail. The 31 people were arrested on Thursday on charges of arson, public violence and malicious damage to property. They were granted R1 000 bail each by the Koster Magistrates Court yesterday. Their arrest followed violent protests last Wednesday, when properties and businesses belonging to the mayor were torched and looted and foreigners’ shops were ransacked. They were warned to stay away from protests and looting. Residents came out in their numbers to gather outside the court entrance, demanding that the 31 be released without having to put up bail. Community leader Lazarus Mazaleni said once they were released the situation in the area would return to normal. “We want the mayor to step down and for those arrested to be released without bail. They are unemployed because the mayor does not employ us. We do not have money for bail.” He said they would not move from the court and their protest would continue if their demands were not met. Shops, schools and institutions remained closed and a heavy police presence maintained peace and calm in the area yesterday. The case has been postponed to 28 June.
