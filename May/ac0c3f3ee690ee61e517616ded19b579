HUNDREDS of mourners including representatives from business and government officials gathered to say goodbye to Sam Nzima yesterday. The memorial service was held at the legendary photographer’s home in Lillydale in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. His doctor and family friend Dr Harry Mabunda told mourners he had received a call from Sam’s daughter Bongi two weeks ago. “Fortunately the clinic resuscitated him,” he said. “I then said they must take him to Rob Ferreira Hospital in Nelspruit. “After a few hours, he was admitted to get treatment for a heart attack. “Two days later he collapsed again and was resuscitated but it was already too late. His death is still a mystery as he was doing well.” Speaker after speaker described Nzima, who took the famous photograpgh of Hector Pieterson’s body being carried away during the 1976 Soweto uprising, as a selfless person. They said he was humble and accessible and contributed a lot to his community and politics. His son Thulani said: “Death is like a thief, a devil and is so quick. It’s difficult to come to terms with dad’s death. “Bra Sam died because it was his time and his work speaks for him. “He was honoured abroad for his prestigious work. “We are thankful to the government for making sure he gets a fitting funeral.” Nzima’s memorial service was attended by Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa, ANC national working committee member Ronald Lamola, ANC Youth League deputy president Desmond Moela, Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtsweni, and Bushbuckridge mayor Sylvia Nxumaloe. He will be buried tomorrow at his home.
