Victory Outreach Church has launched a drug and alcohol support group. The event was held at the Gugulethu Sports Complex in Cape Town on Saturday. Pastor Charles Lopez, who was a drug addict, said the group would meet every day in the kasi. He said he could not just sit and watch people, especially teens, destroy their lives. “Our vision is to reach drug addicts, gangsters and their families. When a person starts using drugs it also affects everyone around them,” he said. Lopez is originally from California in the US. He moved to Cape Town in 2008. ”I used to smoke tik, whoonga and other drugs but in 1999 I decided to give my life to God and quit doing drugs,” said Lopez. He said he was also in and out of jail because of his addiction. His church also runs Victory Home, which is a rehabilitation centre for drug addicts. They take addicts in and keep them in the home for nine months. Addicts do not pay anything, but work hard to quit drugs and change their lives. “As a former drug addict it is easy for me to talk to them. “We call the Victory Home our spiritual place and hospital because after those nine months they come out healed.” Nompulelo Mkosi (27), also a former drug addict, started using drugs in high school. “I started by smoking cigarettes and from there I went on to heavy drugs. It got to a point where I sold my clothes to feed my addiction,” said Mkosi. She thanked the church for changing her life. Luthando Celu (23), a former addict and dealer, said he was grateful to the church for giving him his life back. “I was in and out of jail because I was doing bad things. I am happy I have changed.” Word of Life pastor Vuyani Buwe said they had never had a support group like this in their kasi. “I hope youngsters will get help. I know the pain of seeing your child abuse drugs, as I also have a son who’s an addict.”
