PUPILS of Magaliesburg Secondary School supported by Ithuteng Secondary School, a neighbouring school, have joined forces to fight for their rights. The pupils are up in arms against the police after they said police fired shots and threw tear gas at them while they were protesting peacefully. The said they had no choice but to fight back by throwing stones. Pupils from the Magalies boarding school in Ga-Mogale said they were tired of eating rotten food and bathing in cold water. Day scholars are demanding school buses as they say it is not safe to hike. The pupils said they sent out a memorandum to their district and gave them a deadline to respond. “They did not bother to respond. We have spoken to them on several occasions but failed to get through.” Matric pupil and member of the RCL Kgomolemo Modisane (17) said boarding school pupils started a peaceful protest on Friday, boycotting classes without disturbing day scholars. “We made sure we did not disturb other pupils. On Monday the day scholars came forward with their grievances. Today we stand together fighting for our rights,” said Kgomolemo. He said pupils from Ithuteng joined them and two pupils from that school were taken in by police. Some community members also joined the protest. Pupils barricaded the R509 and stoned passing vehicles. Local and public order police are monitoring the situation. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “We can confirm that pupils protested outside the school. There were no casualties reported. “Pupils returned to the boarding facility and they will get a response.” Mabona said that teaching would be resumed today.
