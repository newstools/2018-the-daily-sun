LUCKILY for the dead in this cemetery, they cannot smell what’s happening on this side of the grave. Zwakala squatters have made their home next to Sgodi Cemetery in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni. And because they don’t have anywhere else to relieve themselves, they’ve turned the dead’s resting place into their toilet! The stench of sewage constantly hangs over the cemetery and those living close to it can longer bear the smell. On Friday, gatvol residents marched to the local municipal offices to demand that they be provided with toilets. Some of the residents went into the cemetery to demonstrate how they are forced to squat next to the tombs. But they paid a painful price as public order police opened fire with rubber bullets. People ran but suffered wounds to their stomachs, buttocks and other body parts. The squatters told Daily Sun they had been begging the municipality for toilets. “Having a toilet gives a person a sense of dignity. “Instead we suffer humiliation as we have to squat here to relieve ourselves,” said Funiwe Zungu, who was shot in the hand. Another resident, Velaphi Mahlangu, said going to the cemetery for relief was degrading to women and invited rapists to prey on them. “For the sake of our women and children, we appeal to the municipality to hear us out. How long must this go on?” he asked. “The graveyard is filthy with kak and toilet paper. We don’t like to do this but people have no choice.” Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said they were in the process of providing toilets to all squatter camps in the city.
