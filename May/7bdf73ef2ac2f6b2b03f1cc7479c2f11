THE former Metro cop who assaulted actress Lele Ledwaba has been fined R12 000. If she fails to pay the money, she will be sent to jail for four months. However, Lele is not happy with the decision of the Randburg Magistrates Court. Yesterday she told Daily Sun: “I am grateful that justice was served, but I feel this sentence is very light. It’s like a slap on the wrist. I can’t even begin to explain what I went through.” She said her four-year-old child, who was with her when she was assaulted, was still afraid of the police. She said her attacker, Trekkie Tikhoni, showed no remorse. “This is someone who took an oath to serve and protect, but she went against that,” she said. The attack took place in Kyalami, Joburg, in 2015. Magistrate Nosiphiwo Gcawa told Tikhoni she had abused her position of authority. “The accused in this court was in a position of authority. She was a Joburg Metro officer who was supposed to be trusted by the complainant,” she said. The magistrate said that instead, Tikhoni had abused a helpless woman who was in the company of her child. “The complainant was humiliated and violated by someone she should have trusted. Her child was indirectly subjected to trauma,” said Gcawa. She said it was the court’s responsibility to give Tikhoni a second chance to mend her ways and become a better person. In addition to the fine, she was ordered to do 100 hours of community service and attend an anger management programme. Lele’s father, Abe, said he respected the court’s decision but he was not altogether happy with the sentence. “I am praying that whatever happens with my daughter’s abuser, she gets rehabilitated,” he said.
