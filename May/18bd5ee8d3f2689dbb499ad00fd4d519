FAMILY and friends are still shocked after a promising young dancer and singer, Busisiwe Dube, committed suicide. The 16-year-old from Braamfontein, Joburg, died on Sunday at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital after she took rat poison on Friday. Her family said she killed herself after she had an argument with friends. Busisiwe turned 16 on Saturday. She was an active member of a gospel group, Sisters of Paradise, which she joined in 2013. Founder and leader of the group, Thembi Sibanda (35), said the group was devastated by the news. “We are in great pain about her sudden death. We cannot believe she has left us so quickly,” she said. Thembi said Busisiwe’s death was a lesson to her team and to all young people, that they should always listen to their parents. She told Daily Sun the group members were in tears and struggling to cope. “Many still do not believe Busisiwe is gone,” she said. Busisiwe was a grade 9 pupil at Sir Isaac Newton High School in Joburg. Thembi described Busisiwe as a talented member of the group whose role would always be remembered and missed. Busisiwe’s mum, Sweetness Dube (35), said she was still trying to make sense of her daughter’s untimely death. “I cannot even explain the pain I am going through. Her death has affected the family a lot,” she said. The family are appealing to SunReaders to help them bury Busisiwe. A memorial service will be held on Friday in Yeoville. Busisiwe will be buried on Saturday at a cemetery to be identified. Police spokesman Sergeant Mduduzi Zondo said an inquest docket had been opened.
