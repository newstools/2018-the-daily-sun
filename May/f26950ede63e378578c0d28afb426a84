Said the statement: “The African National Congress (ANC) in Bokone Bophirima accepts with a sense apprehension - but great pride - the decision by our Provincial Chairperson, Cde Supra “SOR” Mahumapelo to voluntarily exit from his deployment as Premier.” “As an organisation we will forever be appreciative and learn from his emphatic, principled but simple approach to issues.” “We know that he will continue to serve his movement the ANC in whatever new role we will decide for him. We urge him to remain steadfast in what he believes are the necessary tasks of executing the revolution. "As the ANC in Bokone Bophirima we still believe in Cde Supra’s innocence until he’s proven otherwise and we commend him for putting the interests of the province and its people before his own.” Mahumapelo is expected to address the media on Wednesday on the way forward. Mahumapelo says he will follow due process and send a letter to the speaker of the provincial legislature. North West residents recently took to the streets in violent protests demanding that Mahumapelo resign amid corruption allegations leveled against him.
