GOING to school barefoot, wearing worn-out school uniforms, is now a thing of the past for these pupils. Kids at Peter Mokaba Primary School in Moloto Village near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, received uniforms from taximen recently. The uniforms were donated by the KwaNdebele United Local and Long Distance Taxi Association. Thembisile Hani mayor Nomsa Mtsweni told Daily Sun it always makes her sad to see kids struggling. “For our kids to pass matric, we have to prepare them now,” said Mtsweni. “We must know what they need and support them in every way. “Our love for our school kids has brought us here, and this forms part of respecting former president Nelson Mandela’s wish to care for them.” The mayor said school kids are future leaders who must be nurtured and looked after. Taxi boss Roger Ntuli told the People Paper: “We want to show people that our industry is not about violence and bullying passengers. “It is communities who support us after we’ve bought taxis,” he said. Principal Reuben Masia said the donations will motivate kids to come to school. Acting commander Brigadier Lindiwe Dhlamini warned the school kids not to carry dangerous weapons and to stay away from drugs.
