The SABC has reiterated that there are no criminal charges being investigated against Motsweding FM. The public broadcaster yesterday told Daily Sun the special investigating unit investigations are ongoing but refused to elaborate further. The special investigating unit has since clarified that the investigation is in relation to the SABC as an entity, not specifically to Motsweding FM alone. The investigation comes after then president, Jacob Zuma, signed the proclamation for the investigation last September. The special investigating unit refused to comment on the status or progress of the investigation. Some of the areas for investigation include maladministration, improper conduct by then board members, unlawful expenditure of public funds and improper behaviour by staff. Last year the SABC charged station manager Katlego Mokhele after several allegations were levelled against him. Kaizer Kganyago, the public broadcaster’s spokesman, said the disciplinary hearing against Mokhele was finalised in December. Motsweding FM has recently announced a new line-up that includes Amon Mokoena, who was scooped from sister station Metro FM. Mokoena’s versatility has already proved to be a winner as he has settled into the Setswana medium wave station with ease. Other personalities roped in include Generations: The Legacy actor Rapulana Seiphemo and Refilwe Modiselle Kganyago said: “An established brand like Motsweding FM requires a constant process of repositioning itself, and this includes making changes when necessary. “Line-up changes happen all the time. They’re guided and informed by the station’s strategic objectives and reflect a continuous commitment by the station to stay relevant and maximise audience share.”
