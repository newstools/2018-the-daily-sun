RESIDENTS of Ntabamhlophe Village in Nquthu, northern KZN, fear for their kids’ safety. They want a bridge to be built over the Nondweni River. Their kids have to step on stones to get to the other side. When the river is flooded, kids take off their uniforms and swim to the other side. Two boys aged 12 and 13 drowned in August. Resident Nokwazi Ntshangase (51) said: “We’re forced to wake up early to help our children cross the river. “When school is out, we wait for them at Nondweni.” Filda Buthelezi (68), the gogo of the two teenage boys who drowned last year, said the river brings painful memories. “We’ve reported the matter to our councillor, but nothing has been done,” said gogo Filda. Councillor Lindokuhle Shabalala said he had shared the residents’ grievances with the Nquthu Municipality. The matter was referred to the Umzinyathi Municipality. Nquthu mayor Mabilabila Kunene said: “Building a bridge requires a lot of money. That’s why we asked Umzinyathi to intervene.” Umzinyathi mayor Patrice Ngubane said a budget must be drawn up before work is done. “We’re going to set up a meeting with the transport department,” he said. “Building the bridge is one of their responsibilities.”
