HOLDING meetings in the open will soon be a thing of the past at Embonisweni Primary School. On Tuesday the Free State Department of Education in partnership with Sibanye-Stillwater and the mineral resources department, unveiled a new hall at the Welkom school. The mining company donated R4,6 million in order to build the new school hall. Free State education HOD Tsoarelo Malakoane said: “This is a social responsibility programme of Sibanye. “The school principal identified the need for a school hall because they often had to cancel important meetings due to bad weather. “The hall has been built mostly by people from Welkom, including unemployed parents of pupils at the school. About 23 of them were temporarily employed.” Malakoane said it was pleasing that the project was of benefit to many residents of Welkom. Sibanye’s Beatrix mine head Band Malunga said they were very happy to hand the new hall over to the school. “This hall is meant to serve the school children and the community of Welkom. We urge the community to take care of it. Our aim is to invest in the education of our children,” he said. Principal George Motsoeneng said they were very grateful for the donation. “The Adopt A School Foundation and other stakeholders were highly effective in building this school hall. This hall will be used solely to develop the community of Welkom,” he said.
