SIZOPHILA Mahlobo (24) loved water. He studied it as a hydrology student specialising in water quality at the University of KZN. Whenever he had a spare moment you would find him paddling a canoe on rivers and dams with his friends. But it was also water that claimed the life of the young man from Richards Bay, northern KZN. He drowned on Saturday while trying to retrieve a canoe at Midmar Dam. ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said bystanders told emergency workers the group of friends swam out to get a canoe when they noticed Sizophila was missing. “Search and rescue divers found his body in the dam. Sadly there was nothing paramedics could do for him and he was declared dead at the scene,” said Vermaak. Phiwayinkosi Mungwe, SRC secretary general, said Sizophila’s death wasn’t just a loss to the university but to the country as he was specialising in a profession which was scarce among black people. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said an inquest docket was opened at Howick cop shop.
