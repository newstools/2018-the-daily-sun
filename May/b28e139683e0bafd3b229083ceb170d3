IT’S relegation D-Day in the PSL as the dreaded axe looms. Forget about the fight for the Absa Premiership top three or title celebrations for champions Mamelodi Sundowns in Bloemfontein. The real battle is in the bottom half where it’s survival of the fittest. As many as four PSL teams face the harsh reality of possibly competing in the National First Division (NFD) next season if they don’t get the desired result in the last round of fixtures on Saturday. Of course, there are the relegation/promotion play-offs, where the PSL losers get a second chance to hang on to their status. But there are no guarantees of survival against promotion candidates, Jomo Cosmos and Black Leopards, who are salivating at the thought of promotion. Besides, no one wants to go through the daunting promotion play-offs while they could be planning for the new season already. Pick of the matches is the “relegation six-pointer” between Kaitano Tembo’s SuperSport United and Doctor Khumalo’s Baroka FC at Lucas Moripe Stadium, where the winners will be guaranteed safety. Matsatsantsa a Pitori have never finished outside the top eight in 17 years and they face arguably the sternest test of their existence. It is no different for Ajax Cape Town, who are clinging to the faint mathematical hope of survival as they face a make-or-break clash with Kaizer Chiefs at Cape Town Stadium. Polokwane City also have a must-win match at home against Chippa United, where victory will see them avoid the relegation scrap. All the PSL games kick off at 3pm, as the PSL looks to avoid the possibility of games’ outcome being influenced. Expect heartbreak and relief in equal measure!
