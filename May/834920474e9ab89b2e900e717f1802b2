Nigerian sensation Davido, real name David Adedeji Adeleke, was in the headlines for all the wrong reasons not too long ago. ICYMI: ‘BOITY VS DAVIDO!’ However, the If hit-maker has quickly put that reported row with Boity behind him and focused on his girlfriend, Chioma’s happiness. A Porsche 911, worth around R1.5-million, is sure to bring a smile to anyone’s face and that is what Davido bought for his girlfriend on her birthday. The singer shared a video on Instagram in which he presents his 23 year-old girlfriend with the extravagant birthday gift. “I give my baby ASSURANCE!!! I love you baby!! WE IN THIS 4 LIFE!! @thechefchi !! HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHIOM CHIOM !! FROM ME TO YOU!! I BOUGHT MY BABY A PORSCHE!!,” Davido captioned the video.
