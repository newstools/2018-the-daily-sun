TWO YEARS ago, everything started going wrong in Bhekumuzi Ngcongo’s life. When his two cars broke down and he discovered he was broke, he started searching for answers with no success. BUT ON FRIDAY, he realised someone meant him harm when he found muthi at his gate! The 64-year-old from Kagiso, Mogale City, told Daily Sun he finally understood why things had not been going well for him. “Some evil people are behind my failures. They are trying to destroy me and my family,” he said. Bhekumuzi said he found muthi and a dead chicken wrapped in a cloth at the gate. There were also two blue candles, snuff scattered around and a bottle filled with dirty water. The candles had burned halfway down and there were burnt matchsticks all over. Sangoma Jabulani Mthimkhulu said: “This proves that whoever put this muthi here did some rituals before they left. They were going to bury the muthi at the gate but something might have disturbed them.” He said if the person responsible had managed to bury the muthi, death would have started haunting the Ngcongo family. “They must be thankful the evil plan didn’t succeed.” Bhekumuzi said he recently joined a church near his house and believed it had helped protect him. “Our pastor gave us holy oil and I sprinkle it around the yard every night before we sleep,” he said. Bhekumuzi said he believed the power of the holy oil had prevented the evil people from burying the muthi. While the SunTeam was at Bhekumuzi’s home, his pastor arrived and instructed him and his wife Julia Maphakula (54) to burn the muthi and throw it away. The pastor wouldn’t talk to the SunTeam. Julia poured her last bottle of holy oil on the muthi and the couple celebrated after pouring petrol on it and setting it alight. Julia said: “We fear nothing in the name of our Lord. No muthi used against us will prosper “We feel whoever did this wasted their time, money and energy. They should have braaied this chicken but now we’re doing it on their behalf.”
