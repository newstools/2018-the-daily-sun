BRAVE workers at a palm oil plantation in Aceh Tamiang,
north Indonesia managed to capture a massive crocodile that tried to attack one
of their colleagues. According to Coconuts,
the heroic workers leapt to their colleagues defence on Monday, throwing
sacking over the crocs eyes before shutting its huge mouth with rope. Aji Prabowo, head of Aceh’s Natural Resources
Conservation Center (BKSDA) told reporters: “The estuarine crocodile captured
by the community has a length of about five meters and weighs an estimated 900kg.
The crocodile is male and 90 years old.” The croc will be released in a nearby uninhabited section
of forest.
