ALL Samuel Ngwenya wanted was to protect himself from thugs, so he got five vicious dogs. But the 39-year-old from Marikana in Soshanguve, Tshwane, never expected that his dogs would attack his neighbour, Christina Ndaba (58). Christina, who is recovering from bite wounds to her leg and arm, said she was on her way home from a shop on Friday when the dogs ran out of Samuel’s open gate and attacked her. “I was so scared, I thought I was going to die.” Christina said residents had been complaining about the dogs in the area for a long time. Samuel said he was not home when the incident happened. “I received a call from the neighbours saying my dogs had bitten Christina. I was shocked as I had locked the gate when I left. I had to let the dogs go for the safety of residents.” SPCA inspector Meshack Matlou said the dogs were removed. “They were vicious and the owner asked us to take them.”
