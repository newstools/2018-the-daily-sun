KHULA Village ANC councillor Siya Khumalo is afraid that people who torched his office will burn his home as well. The arson attack happened in Mtubatuba in northern KZN on Friday. A security guard alerted Khumalo (38). “I’m afraid that whoever has an agenda against me will attack me at home,” he said. “I wish cops could speed up their investigation and make arrests.” He said he was still in shock and didn’t know what the motive behind the attack was. “I have no enemies or any political fights within the municipality,” he said. He said the guard had told him the fire started a minute after two unknown men asked to use the tap inside the office. He apparently let them in, but after stepping out of the gate they started running. Khumalo said what scared him was that they didn’t break in or take anything. “I suspect they threw whatever started the fire through a window,” he said. “All the documents I had kept in my office since my term started in 2011 were destroyed in the fire.” Khumalo, who’s been leading by-election campaigns, said he’d only feel safe once an investigation had identified the culprits. “I won’t rest not knowing what these people want from me,” he said. “I trust cops will be quick with their investigation.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed that the local councillor’s office in Khula Village was set alight. “The cause of the fire is unknown at this stage,”she said. “Mtubatuba police are investigating a case of arson and no arrest has been made.”
