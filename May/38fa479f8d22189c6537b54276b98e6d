As South Africans celebrated Workers' Day on Tuesday, the rand fell to its lowest level yet under a Cyril Ramaphosa Presidency. At 22:10, the rand was trading at R12.67/$, down 1.72% on the day. It had opened at R12.45 to the dollar. The last time the local currency traded at this level was in mid-December 2017. The fall in the rand was caused mainly by dollar strength. "The dollar soared to an almost 4-month high as the markets anticipate a hawkish [Federal Reserve Meeting], driving gold prices and emerging markets lower," said Peregrine Treasury Solutions in an afternoon note. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar's relative strength against a basket of currencies, was at 92.476 at 22:10, up 0.7%. This is near its highest level yet in 2018.
