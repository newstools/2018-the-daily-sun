MADALA Hlukabisa Mpu might be 108 years old, but he is still a young man at heart! Hlukabisa, probably the oldest man in the Nyandeni Local Municipality area, reckons no man standing can defeat him in stick fighting. On Friday his family, friends and Nyandeni mayor Mesuli Ngqondwana celebrated his birthday in style. As people arrived at his home in Mlengana Village in Libode, the madala kept asking for a nip of brandy. That is what has kept him going for so many years, the madala told Daily Sun. The SunTeam found the madala sitting by himself, eating meat. He was surprised by the throng of people and had first thought they were there to attack him. He immediately took up his two knobkerries and threatened to beat up everyone, but after the mayor explained the purpose of their visit, the madala eased up. The two birthday cakes helped! The madala’s son, Gqamgqamana (66) said his father loved samp and red meat. He said the madala had 19 children with three wives, all of whom had died. “My father knows all of us. He can recognise us and tell who is who. His eyesight is still very sharp. He is a very strict father and wants things done a certain way. He still tells us what to do. We thank God for keeping him this long. We are blessed and will continue to love and cherish him,” said Gqamgqamana. The madala’s presents included groceries, a couch, bedding set and blanket. These were from Good Samaritans from the small town. Ngqondwana pledged a bed and urged businessman Mnyamezeli Madolo to buy a headboard. “We want to be a government that is involved in the lives of its people. We are happy to have such an old person in our municipality,” he said.
