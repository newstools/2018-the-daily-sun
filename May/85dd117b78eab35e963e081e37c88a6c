POLICE officers from Site B, Khayelitsha, came bearing gifts when they visited Qhayiya Children’s Home last Monday. They donated food and toiletries to the home, which takes care of 26 disabled kids. Captain Ntandazo Mncanca said society often forgets people living with disabilities. “It is important for us to show that we care about them. This it is not the last time these kids will see us here,” said Mncanca. He said he was grateful to the local businesses that gave a helping hand. “We would not have been able to do this without the assistance of local businesspeople who didn’t hesitate to help when we asked for donations.” Asanda Vava (28), a helper at the home, said they appreciated what the officers did. “We didn’t know they did this kind of thing. We thought they only fought crime,” said Vava. Resident Nolikhaya Melani (45) said: “It was the first time I have saw cops doing such a thing. I’ve only seen them arrest people. “I didn’t know they spent time with kids. They are creating a good relationship with the community. “Now it will be easier for us to report crime.”
