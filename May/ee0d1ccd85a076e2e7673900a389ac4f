African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal applauds delegates of the four regions that convened successful Regional Conferences this weekend and elected new leadership. Sihle Zikalala, ANCKZN Provincial Task Team Coordinator said the ANC is satisfied that all the regional conferences were conducted in line with the ANC Constitution.He said the conferences held at Emahlahleni, Far North, Inkosi Bhambatha and Musa Dladla showed much needed political maturity among the delegates."The outcomes of all the regional conferences are a true reflection of the wishes of the membership of the ANC.  The elections were free and fair and the debates were robust and frank, true to the traditions of the movement," said Zikalala. He added that the healthy contestations of the top five positions and the comradely manner in which all comrades welcomed the results, confirmed deep rooted traditions of the Mass Democratic Movement."Indeed the peaceful and disciplined manner in which the conferences were conducted confounded the prophets of doom who propagated lies and made false predictions of blood on conference floors. "All the conferences were opened by the ANC NEC and Provincial Task Team members. These conferences were characterized by a great mood of discipline and comradeship among the delegates in spite of tight contestations."All necessary steps were taken to ensure a credible outcome following the adoption of credentials. All processes leading to the nomination and eventually the election of the officials and regional executive committee were characterized by generally notable discipline and adherence to conference rules."The elective conferences proceeded in the presence of NEC members deployed and all processes leading to the nomination and eventually the election of the regional officials."The ANC is also encouraged by the observation made by independent electoral agency that the elections of the regional leadership were free and fair and devoid of any anarchy."We are confident that the elected regional leadership collective that emerged from these internal processes of the ANC elected in these regions will steer the ANC to the right directions to ensure the implementation of the 54th National Conference resolutions including land expropriation without compensation, free education for the poor and Radical Socio-Economic Transformation."The ANC congratulates all the leadership elected and welcome the radical programme of action to hit the ground running to bring about unity and deliver a decisive victory for the ANC in the 2019 General Elections." The four regions elected as follows: Emalahleni RegionChairperson – Cde Ntuthuko MahlabaDeputy Chairperson – Cde Phumzile Mbatha-CeleSecretary – Cde Chris MhlopheDeputy Secretary – Cde Phumzile MgcinaTreasurer – Cde Bheki Nkosi Far North RegionChairperson – Cde Bethuel MthethwaDeputy Chairperson – Cde Jabulani MkhabelaSecretary – Cde Siphile MdakaDeputy Secretary – Cde Zodwa MhlongoTreasurer – Cde Verus Thobelani Ncamphalala Musa Dladla RegionChairperson – Cde Mduduzi MhlongoDeputy Chairperson – Cde Thembeka MchunuSecretary – Cde Tholinhlanhla GwalaDeputy Secretary – Cde Mthoko DlaminiTreasurer – Cde Lindo Phungula Inkosi Bhambatha RegionChairperson  - Cde Lucky MoloiDeputy Chairperson – Cde Siduduzo MdluliSecretary – Cde Bheki LembetheDeputy Secretary – Cde Lungi MabasoTreasurer – Cde Linda Ngubane
