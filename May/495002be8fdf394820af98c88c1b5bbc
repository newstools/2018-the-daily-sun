The South African Police Service (SAPS) has confirmed that
there is indeed shortage of evidence collection kits in some of the police
stations. The SAPS is now redistributing the evidence collection kits
to stations that are experiencing shortages. This comes after recent reports stating that police stations
including the Plessislaer police station’s Family Violence, Child Protection
and Sexual Offences (FCS) unit, are under-resourced and short of DNA and Rape
Kits. In a statement, police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo
said the SAPS had entered into a tender process to procure more evidence
collection kits. He said two of the suppliers that took part in the bid
process were disqualified because they could not meet the specifications as
outlined by the department. “During this process, the SAPS however discovered that the
third supplier that did meet the required specifications is currently under
criminal investigation. Therefore, the SAPS could not continue with the
awarding of the tender,” said Naidoo. “In the meantime, to avoid a total lack of these resources,
SAPS has embarked on a procurement process through a quotation basis,” said
Naidoo. He said in the procurement process, they have identified
some companies and they are currently assessing their suitability to provide
the required evidence collection kits. He added: “The SAPS is also currently in the process of
redistributing the evidence collection kits to clusters and stations that are
experiencing shortages. The SAPS is satisfied that these actions will ensure
that there is sufficient stock for a period of two months whilst the
acquisition process unfolds.”
