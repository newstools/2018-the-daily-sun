PARLIAMENT paid tribute to late ANC veterans Dr Zola Skweyiya and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela at an event yesterday. EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee said the people of North West were suffering because of Premier Supra Mahumapelo. “Dr Skweyiya would not have appreciated that. He must be turning in his grave,” said Gardee. National Council of Provinces chairwoman Thandi Modise paid a moving tribute to Winnie. She said: “Whether you like it or not, you will never run away from the fact that she lived a life that none of us would have liked. “You might hate her, but the people who met her during her fight against apartheid will always be proud to be associated with her. She got donations, but would pack them into small parcels to share with her people. “We must celebrate the fact that she kept Tata’s name on people’s lips while he was in prison. When you build statues, don’t forget her.” National Freedom Party MP Ahmed Shaik-Emam said a statue of Madikizela-Mandela should be put up in parliament. Sophie Thembakwayo of the EFF said: “We call on the ANC to change the name of Cape Town International Airport to Winifred Nomzamo Madikizela-Mandela Airport.”
