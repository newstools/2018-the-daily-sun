HOPE Cheston was just 14 when she was raped by an armed security guard at an apartment complex in Jonesboro, Georgia in America in 2012. According to the New York Times, Hope had been standing at a picnic table with her boyfriend, when security guard Brandon Lamar Zachary (28) approached them. Zachary told Hope’s boyfriend not to move, forced her on to the picnic table, and raped her. Zachary is currently serving a 20 year sentence for statutory rape. Hope’s mum filed the civil lawsuit in 2015, accusing the security company - Crime Prevention Agency Inc -  that had hired Zachary of negligence in their training and performance, and failing to protect a 14-year-old girl. On Tuesday, jurors awarded Hope $1 billion (R12,49 billion), believed to be the largest jury verdict ever awarded in America in a sexual assault case. The security company is not worth $1 billion, and a judge may still reduce the amount awarded as damages. But both Hope and her lawyer said the judgment is symbolically massively important for sexual assault survivors. Her lawyer, L Chris Stewart, is quoted in the report as saying: “A jury, from now on, will know there is no ceiling on the damages that rape causes to a woman. They literally thought a billion dollars was the value of a 14-year-old being raped in public.” Hope described how her life went to pieces after the rape. She withdrew from friends and family, and was terrified of any man in uniform. “Knowing that just one encounter can change your life forever is terrifying,” she said. Speaking in an interview on Wednesday, Hope, now 20, said: “My verdict basically shows if you stick with it and do what you need to do to get your justice, there’ll be a brighter end.” She is now studying to be a social worker, and volunteers to help the homeless during summer holidays.
