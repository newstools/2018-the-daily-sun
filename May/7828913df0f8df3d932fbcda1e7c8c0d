THE new strategy created by government to bring peace and stability to the Mthatha taxi rank seems to be working. It involves legislation for all taxi ranks to be registered after the conflict between the Uncedo and Bata taxi organisations that killed over 60 people. Government found taxi ranks are created in the town even when there is no need for them At the media briefing yesterday held at her offices, transport MEC Weziwe Tikana said: “We must prioritise the safety of commuters and decided no ranks should just be created without the department’s permission.” She said government had also noticed an increase in crime levels in the taxi industry. “Even those involved in the business will have to get proper registration and authorisation before operating.” Tikana stressed that government had decided taxi ranks should be used by all existing taxi organisations. “We decided to close ranks after hearing some are not permitted to use a particular rank because it belongs to a certain organisation. “There is a new system of admitting them back to the ranks, which everyone will have the right to use.” She said during the readmission process at the ranks, it was found that some were operating illegally by creating ranks for themselves because they did not have operating licences. The SAPS is also ensuring commuter safety by working with the MEC.
