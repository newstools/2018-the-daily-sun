The enterprising Jan and his late wife set up their own public toilets in Marabastad, Tshwane. Jan told Daily Sun people are generally happy with the service he offers them. But last Thursday, a group of people forced their way in and refused to pay. But he resisted. “They searched me, took the money I’d made, and said they were taking over,” he said. “They told me when they’d pour kak and pee over me.” “Those who used the toilets before are full of praise. “We’ve hired four people, as well as my sister.” He said he went to other Tshwane hawkers for help. “They promised to be on standby in case those people come back again,” he told Daily Sun. Ramodike Morema, one of the hawkers, said they will defend the madala. Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo asked for Jan’s details. Mashigo said they’d have to check to see if the City owns the toilets.
