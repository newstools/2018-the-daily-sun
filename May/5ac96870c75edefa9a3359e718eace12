RESIDENTS of Nkungwini in Ingwavuma, northern KZN, took to the streets yesterday. Three weeks ago, municipal officials removed a huge street light that was installed by the previous ward councillor. Resident Zakhe Shiba (38) said: “We spoke to our traditional leaders as well as our ward councillor but none of them could tell us why the light was removed. “Our kids relied on that light when they went to fetch water at the only borehole in the area. “They used to come back late at night because of the long queues. “Now that the light is gone, we are worried about their safety.” Another resident, Vusumuzi Mngomezulu (30), said the neighbourhood is plagued by high levels of stock theft. “We live 30 minutes away from the Swaziland boarder. “The theft of livestock stopped when we got the light. “Now that it’s gone, we are certain the thieves will return,” said Vusumuzi. Councillor Pile Vilane confirmed that the light was removed. However, he could not tell the SunTeam why it was done. Induna Khali Shongwe said: “The light had been in the area for some time but it has since been moved to another neighbourhood. “During a meeting, I told the residents I had no idea who took it,” he said. Police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “No case has been opened. “Police are monitoring the situation.”
