Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale lashed home to deny La Liga champions Barcelona victory in an ill-tempered 'Clasico' which finished 2-2 at the Nou Camp on Sunday after the home side had Sergi Roberto sent off at the end of the first half. Luis Suarez volleyed unbeaten Barca into the lead after 10 minutes following a gut-busting run and cross from Roberto while Cristiano Ronaldo levelled for Champions League finalists Real five minutes later from close range. However, the Portugal forward hurt his ankle in the process and was substituted at halftime. Bale had risked getting sent off for raking his studs against Samuel Umtiti's leg but escaped without a booking on that occasion and Roberto was sent off moments later for hitting Marcelo following an off-the-ball tussle. Lionel Messi scored a mesmerising, record-extending 26th goal in the Clasico to put 10-man Barca back in front after 52 minutes but Bale then silenced the Nou Camp with a thumping strike from the edge of the area. Both sides pushed for a winner and Real could have had a penalty when Jordi Alba caught Marcelo but Barca clung on to remain unbeaten in the league with three games to go. Champions Barca have 87 points while Real are third in the Liga standings with 72 after 35 games. Atletico Madrid are second on 75 but have played one game more.Â  -REUTERS
