PEACE was celebrated at the AbaThembu great palace when prince Mthandeni Mankunku came to ask forgiveness and reunite the royal family. Mankunku said he had been used by a faction that didn’t want acting AbaThembu king Azenathi Dalindyebo on the throne while his father, Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, was in jail. The 49-year-old prince said that there was no bad blood between himself and Azenathi and that the issue had been about the throne. “Before my brother went to jail he said Zanelizwe should take over. I respect that. “I was used by people who had their own agendas, using our tradition of succession to the throne. “I have no problem with Zanelizwe and my brother. “I came back to ask for forgiveness and they granted me that. I will ask for forgiveness from the whole kingdom for the purpose of rebuilding our home,” said Mankunku. “The people that went to court used me. It was clear who was meant to lead,” he said. He said people who come to Bumbane must know he was wholeheartedly welcomed. Azenathi said they slaughtered a sheep and performed rituals to cleanse Mankunku. “My uncle has realised that people were using him. I ‘m happy we’ve settled our differences. We will work together to unite our family and the kingdom,” the acting king said. Mankunku challenged Azenathi for the throne in the Grahamstown High Court but lost the case. “I do not want to celebrate my victory as if it is something to be proud of, but it was something that had to happen. “I know my father must be proud of everything I’ve done so far,” said the 26-year-old acting king. He added that the royal family were in talks with government and that Buyelekhaya should be released from prison soon.
