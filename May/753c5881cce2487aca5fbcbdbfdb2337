THE violent protests that took place in Mbizana, Eastern Cape, last week forced five schools to close their doors. Angry residents even burned two toilets at Luna Primary School, which were donated after Lumka Mketwa (5) was found dead in a pit toilet at the school earlier this year. Mayor Daniswa Mafumbatha said he was disappointed by the residents’ actions. “The community is demanding roads, water and housing. On Friday we had a meeting with residents and they agreed to wait for the relevant departments to respond to them,” he said. He said the municipality strongly condemned those who burnt schools during service delivery protests. “These protesters fail to understand that by destroying what has already been provided, they are delaying progress,” he said. Eastern Cape Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said they were shocked by the residents’ behaviour. “Not long ago, they were complaining about the condition of toilets at the school,” he said. Mtima said the five schools will remain closed while the authorities holds talks with the residents. “The community needs to assure the department our pupils and teachers are safe,” he said. Police spokeswoman Captain Edith Mjoko said the vandalism was being investigated and although it had not yet been proven, cops suspected it was related to the service delivery protest. She said: “A case of malicious damage to property was opened at Bizana Police Station but no arrests have been made yet.”
