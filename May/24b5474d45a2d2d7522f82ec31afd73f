TWO police officers have been shot at by unknown suspects  while responding to a scene of crime in
Sekhukhune in Limpopo. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said as they were
responding, a Toyota Etios came speeding from behind and overtook them. He said the cops switched on the blue lights, in an effort  to stop them. The vehicle suddenly stopped and two rifle wielding suspects jumped out
and started spraying the police vehicle with bullets, concentrating on the crew
side. A 26-year-old Constable, who was in the van crew, was hit on the side of
the head. He was taken to hospital in a satisfactory condition and the other was
not injured. Mojapelo  said the suspects are
believed to be the ones terrorising the areas of Burgersfort, Jane Furse and
Groblersdal. He said the police have opened two cases of attempted murder and
malicious damage to property.
