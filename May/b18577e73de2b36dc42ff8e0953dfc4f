COPS have warned people involved in the chaos at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban two weeks ago that they’ve started tracking them down. A taxi driver (35), rank manager (29) and truck driver (35) were bust on Monday in connection with the violence after Kaizer Chiefs lost 2-0 to Free State Stars. KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said one of the suspects handed himself over. Two were bust with the help of witnesses who identified them. The men were charged with public violence. “They were arrested by members of the provincial task team.” Asked if one of the suspects was the man who was filmed breaking a TV camera, he said he couldn’t reveal names yet. The suspects were expected to appear in the Durban Magistrates Court today. Acting provincial police commissioner Major-General Bheki Langa welcomed the arrests and said more people would be bust. “It’s only a matter of time before others are arrested,” Langa told Daily Sun. “I advise the suspects to hand themselves over to the police or keep looking over their shoulders.”
