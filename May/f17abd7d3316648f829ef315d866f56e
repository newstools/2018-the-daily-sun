THE Hawks raided the North West Department of Agricultural Development’s offices yesterday. The department – which is being investigated for corruption and fraud – is accused of buying 24 Bonsmara cows and donating them to former president Jacob Zuma. Former premier Supra Mahumapelo allegedly instructed the department to buy the cows, which were worth about R1,5 million. Agricultural development MEC Manketse Tlhape made headlines in March after she was accused of using public funds to pay for a cosmetic procedure priced at R100 000. A Facebook user also claimed Tlhape instructed a company called Agri Delight, which was contracted to the department, to buy her a fast food franchise. The company allegedly paid R1,1 million for a Roman’s Pizza franchise in Mahikeng. The MEC denied the allegations and said she paid for the nose job herself. In October the portfolio committee on environmental affairs ordered the department to pay back the R100 million used to buy 130 buffalo, 50 white rhino, 50 sable and 32 nyala, worth about R100 million, to a company connected to the ruling party. North West agriculture development spokeswoman Emelda Setlhako referred all queries to the Hawks. Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the raid was a search and seizure of documents, laptops and any information that might assist the investigation. Mulaudzi told the People’s Paper: “After assessing the available evidence it became clear that the department is still in possession of important documents. “No arrests have been made yet,” he said.
