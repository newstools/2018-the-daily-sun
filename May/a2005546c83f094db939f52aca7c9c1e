Volkswagen has officially
launched the Passat CC replacement, and named it the Arteon. The five-door gran tourismo
impresses through revolutionary design and great practical value in use. The Arteon boasts bars on
the radiator grille which extend into the three-dimensional front headlights,
while LED lighting elements additionally emphasise the striking layout and
demonstrate dominance. According to VW, the name
Arteon is made up of two component
parts: 'Art' describes the fastback’s harmonious lines and emotionality. The ending 'eon' identifies
it, in the same way as Volkswagen’s top model for the Chinese market, the
Phideon, as a premium mode. It has a diverse range of very
expressive colours, the styling lines of the Arteon are as precise as they are
dynamic and they are accentuated by many new exterior body colours. These include the distinctive
hues Curcuma Yellow, Atlantic Blue and Chili Red - fitting in well with the
