TWO men accused of murdering Kuils River mom Zarah Hector,
34, have been found guilty in the Western Cape High Court. Ronaldo van Rooyen, 34, and Tawfeeq Ibrahim, 26, were
expressionless when they were on Wednesday convicted of murder and aggravated
robbery. Hector's body was found wrapped in plastic and dumped in Groot
Drakenstein in March 2016. She was bludgeoned to death with a hammer or similar object,
allegedly in the garage at Van Rooyen’s parents' home. According to the post-mortem, she died of extensive blunt
force head injuries. Both accused had pleaded not guilty, and opted not to
testify. Hector was last seen by a colleague leaving the Oostenberg
Lodge in Kuils River, where she worked. Her body was found nine days later. The men are believed to have murdered Hector because they
wanted to steal the BMW Z3 she was driving. She allegedly owed Van Rooyen
"a lot of money”. The vehicle belonged to Hector's boyfriend. Following her disappearance, Hector's loved ones had called
the police and told them that she may be at Van Rooyen's house. The three had apparently been friends. SOURCE: NEWS24
