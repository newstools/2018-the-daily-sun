The bus
strike has come to an end. After four
weeks in which the bus sector employees refused to report for work until their
demands were met, labour unions have come to an agreement with bus employers. Labour
unions representing bus drivers released a joint statement announcing that they
have accepted the latest wage offer in an attempt to end the strike in what
unions called “the power of the working class unity”. The
agreement reached was for a 9% across-the-board wage increase for the first
year effective as of 01 April 2018 to 31 March 2019; 8% across-the-board wage
increase for the second year, effective as of 1 April 2019 to March 31 2020;
and the minimum basic wage to increase by 9% as of date of signature and 8% as
of 1 April 2019. Nightshift
hours and the dual driver issues, along with in-sourcing, have been referred to
a task team to be overseen by the CCMA. Workers
have already begun reporting for duty across the country. “We want to
thank our members for their militant discipline throughout the strike,” the
joint statement read. “They were
resolute and determined throughout and we honour them for their huge sacrifice.
The strike began on the 18th of April and since then they have given up their
wages in order to secure better conditions.” Unions also
said that they will continue to work with the task teams to ensure that dual
drivers get a full salary.
