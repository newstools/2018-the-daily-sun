THIS year is proving to be the one where South Africans are forced to dig deeper into their pockets. The first blow came when the value added tax increase was announced in February. Last month, the price of fuel went up by almost R1 a litre. Last week, the rand experienced a three-month low against the dollar. On Wednesday, motorists we were hit again by another petrol price hike. The price of a litre of 93 unleaded petrol went from R14,23 to R14,72. On the other hand, the price of diesel increased by 59 cents per litre. The cost of illuminating paraffin went up by 52 cents. Daily Sun spoke to motorists in Tshwane, who said the hikes were making a difficult situation almost unbearable. Paul Dlamini (35) from Orchards said he wished salary increases were tailored to accommodate petrol price hikes. “The price of petrol goes up four or five times a year but goes down once or twice if we are lucky. “These hikes are insane and don’t match our salary increases.” Taxi driver Israel Ramorola from Kgabalatsane said government needs to subsidise fuel. He said the hikes made it hard for taxi drivers to pay off their debts. “VAT has just been increased. “Now the price of petrol has gone up twice in a month. “How are we going to pay off these taxis? They were bought on credit,” he said Thushano Mphahlele (27) from Atteridgeville said Mzansi is becoming a place where only the rich can live comfortably. “Most South Africans are poor, yet everything is expensive. This government does not care about the poor.” Dumisani Mlambo (39) from Mamelodi East said citizens should protest against tax and fuel price increases. He said the government got away with the increases because no one challenged them.
