THEY call him mechanic on the road. His customers include cops, truck drivers, teachers and other motorists. But this man doesn’t fix cars . . . he fixes bedrooms! And sangoma Fresh Mlambo brings his imbiza directly to the “drivers”. Every day from Monday to Sunday, Fresh stands next to the busy Molefe Makinta Highway in Soshanguve lifting his hand up and down while shouting “power”! For Fresh (54), who lives in Winterveldt, north of Tshwane, this gesture symbolises the power of his self-made muthi for sleeping 4-5s. He sells his imbiza in two-litre bottles and says his muthi helped many men to restore their bedroom happiness. Fresh described his muthi as a bedroom mechanic for men who can’t satisfy their women in bed. “Men want this muthi because it helps them. I wouldn’t risk my skin to be in the sun every day and my energy for nothing. Hot or cold weather, I’m here,” he said. He said on a good month, especially towards month end, he’s able to sell 20 to 30 bottles. According to Fresh, the majority of his customers come back to thank him. “Those who are ashamed can secretly come to my place to buy,” Fresh told Daily Sun. One of Fresh’s loyal customers, madala Joseph Tlou (65), said: “Each time when I feel weak, I always go straight to Fresh to get help and his muthi has never failed me.” Teacher Phineas Dladla said he realised he’s not the only teacher, but that there are also “bedroom teachers”. Fresh said it isn’t only men who buy his muthi but women also do for men. “They tell me they want their partners to try it out. “One of my female customers once came back to thank me, saying she was seeing changes in her man.”
