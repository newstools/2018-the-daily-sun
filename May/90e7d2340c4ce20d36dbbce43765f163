THEY had gone out to dinner to celebrate her eleventh
birthday. But when she was asleep in bed that night, he came in to her room and
raped her. According to the New
Zealand Herald, this formed part of the testimony given on Tuesday by an
unnamed young woman in Dunedin District Court, southern New Zealand. Remembering the alleged rape, which occurred in 2010, she
said: ''He closed my door and shoved me back on to my bed. ''He was just towering over me, holding me down.'' ''I just didn't know what to do. I was in shock. I was
just really confused from what had happened.'' Afterwards the girl washed her bloodied sheets and put
them in a bag under her bed, before throwing them away the following day. She alleges that her step father told her to keep quiet
about what happened before he left the room. The sexual abuse continued for the next four years,
alleges the young woman. The unnamed man is charged with multiple instances of
sexual assaults. ''He sometimes would just come into my room at night and
just grope me and leave without saying anything . . . just real gross,'' she is
quoted as saying. The woman said she had kept her torment secret until she
broke down at a party in 2015. She confided in a friend, who convinced her to
go to therapy. Soon afterwards, she decided to go to the cops â€œto create
closure for myself and put him away for what he's done.'' Defence counsel Andrew Dawson said his client
''absolutely, categorically'' denied the claims. The trial is set to continue for four days.
