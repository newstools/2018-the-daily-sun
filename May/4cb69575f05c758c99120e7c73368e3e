WHEN he was young he wanted to learn self-defence to protect himself. Now Tshepo Nthatisi (42) is teaching this skill to kids in his area. The 42-year-old from Rocklands in Mangaung fell in love with karate at the age of 11. “I was tired of people bullying me because I was such a shy person,” he said. Tshepo said while he opened his own dojo to train kids in high school. He told Daily Sun: “I opened my dojo in 1998 with the help of my sensei Paul Morake in Botshabelo. “I later moved to Bloemfontein to open another, called the Tshebetso Club. “There I trained young kids in karate, and self-defence to people over 25. So far, I have 58 students.” On Saturday Tshepo and his students took part in the Japan Karate Shotokan national championship in Joburg, where his team brought home 16 medals. “We are now preparing to go to Joburg on 2 June for the Bulls Tournament and will be competing in Durban with Karate South Africa on 22 June,” he said. “Parents are very supportive and contribute money for their kids to go to tournaments.” Tshepo said he loves being a sensei. “I was born for this. I’m a businessman but make time to train kids. “They listen to all the instructions I give them. “I want my kids to stay away from drugs and avoid getting pregnant. “My dream is to see them going to the world championships and Olympics in Tokyo in 2020,” he said. Atlahang Ntsane (15) said: “Karate helps me stay active, even at school. “Our sensei Tshepo always teaches us discipline, as well as self-respect and respect. “Training has helped us stay away from bad things like drugs.”
