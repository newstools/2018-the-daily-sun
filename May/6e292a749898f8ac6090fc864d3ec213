IN THE last financial year, Santam insurance company lost R28 million through 331 fraudulent claims. This was revealed by Moisamie Chetty, a senior manager at Sanlam, during his testimony on Thursday. It came about in the fraud trial of former Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Roland Williams (47). The father of four pleaded guilty to the Sanlam fraud in January in the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court. He admitted to falsely claiming nearly R100 000 from Sanlam for an accident that never happened. He was sentenced to 36 months of correctional supervision in the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday. Williams was sobbing uncontrollably when he took the stand to testify. He said: “I am extremely sorry and remorseful, ashamed and embarrassed about what I have done.” Magistrate Lionel Lindoor also gave Williams a suspended four-year prison sentence, fined him R30 000 and instructed him to pay back the R96 000 owed to Sanlam. Magistrate Lindoor said he had been seriously considering direct imprisonment, and even periodical imprisonment, which would have entailed weekend jail time, but had ultimately been swayed by the plight of Williams’ four children.
