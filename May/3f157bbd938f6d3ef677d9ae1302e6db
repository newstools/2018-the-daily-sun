NELSON Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip survived a motion of no confidence after opposition parties withdrew the six motions they had tabled against him. EFF Councillor Zilindile Vena said: “We withdraw the motion because we don’t have the numbers and there is no need for a fruitless exercise when we know that we are going to lose.” He said they would come back with another motion when they had numbers on their side. The EFF tabled the motion in March after their party leader Julius Malema announced in parliament that they would teach the DA a lesson for its position on land expropriation. But attempts to debate the motion in April again failed after the council speaker decided to adjourn the meeting due to the chaos. At a special council meeting at Wallboard Exchange in Port Elizabeth, opposition parties withdrew all the motions tabled against DA-led coalition leaders, including speaker of the council Jonathan Lawack, chief whip Werner Senekal and Trollip. The ANC was two councillors down after Andile Lungisa was sentenced to two years in prison on Wednesday for assaulting a DA councillor and Bongo Nombiba was sentenced to five years in prison last month for fraud. “With these motions of no confidence behind us the serious work of bringing change to the people forges ahead,” said DA provincial leader Nqaba Bhanga. “The DA considers this a victory for the people of this metro and thanks the parties in council who are standing against the ANC and EFF alliance.”
