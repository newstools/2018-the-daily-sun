THE illegal miners were shocked when the cops arrived out of the blue. At first, the zama zamas working in Springs, Ekurhuleni, froze but then they ran in different directions. Cops found it easy to bust three fat ones who couldn’t run fast. They confiscated all the tools and vans the fleeing zama zamas left behind. Four illegal miners are still at large and the tools and vehicles were taken to Springs Police Station as evidence. Captain Johannes Ramphora said: “Police confiscated generators, a spade and shovel, as well as a Proton bakkie and Corsa utility van, suspected to have been used for their crime.” Ramphora said police carried out the raid to reduce the murders, armed robberies and rapes taking place connected to illegal mining in the area. “Illegal miners often fight between themselves over gold and many end up being robbed and killed. We want to stop crime at its root.” He said the three suspects will appear in court soon on charges relating to illegal mining. Cops are hunting for the four other suspects. Brigadier Thembeka Gwebushe praised the cops for a job well done and stressed the importance of the operation in making the area safe.
