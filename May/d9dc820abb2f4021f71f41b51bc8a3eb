THE family of a five-year-old girl who was raped and murdered was left with more heartache after her funeral. This came after cops told the family a few hours after they had buried little Itumeleng Manoesa that they needed to exhume her body for further tests. The department of health said new evidence that could nail the rapist was needed, but her shocked mum refused. Itumeleng’s body was found in an open field on 30 April after she allegedly ran away from her home when her mother, Tshepiso Ntsoana (22), and her boyfriend were having a heated argument. The couple was arrested and charged with child neglect but their case was provisionally withdrawn for further investigation after they spent a week behind bars. Daily Sun published the story on Monday. The family couldn’t afford to bury the girl and a local undertaker, Jacob Ramabodu from Tshebeletso Funeral Services in Bloemfontein, helped. Family friend Rosalai Setaka told mourners at the girl’s funeral service that she wished she knew how to practise witchcraft. “I would practise it on the evil man that did this. Even when she screamed in pain, the devil did not stop,” said Rosalai. Tshepiso said she would not allow the government to disrespect her daughter. “Why didn’t they finish their job before releasing her body for burial.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sinah Mpakane said the suspect was still on the run. She urged anyone with information to contact their nearest cop shop, or call CrimeStop at 08600 10111, or Kagisanong Detective-Sergeant Morena Machalotsa on 073 729 1732. Free State Health spokesman Mondli Mvambi said evidence that could link the suspect needed to be retrieved from the girl’s body. “A post mortem was conducted but new evidence of alleged sexual abuse has surfaced. “If the only means left to get DNA samples are to exhume the body, this will have to be done,” said Mvambi.
