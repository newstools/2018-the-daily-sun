THE future of Khama Billiat hangs in the air with the star midfielder torn between staying at Mamelodi Sundowns and switching to Orlando Pirates. The PSL league champion’s contract with Sundowns is up next month but he is yet to commit to a new deal, amid tantalising offer from the Buccaneers. He has been reluctant to sign a new deal with the Tshwane giants, having been linked with a free transfer move to Azerbaijan side, Qarabag, in the last few months. But that deal to Eastern Europe looks to be completely off and at best, the twinkled-toed attacker would get a better deal in the PSL. But the overarching question remains… Where? According to a source close to Billiat, he is still mulling over his next move as he sits on two juicy offers. Having won all the trophies on offer with the Tshwane giants, the Buccaneers are willing to offer him a good package and a new challenge. But they face a stiffer challenge from Sundowns, who does not want to see the former PSL Footballer of the Season switch to the rival camp. Sundowns president Patrice Motsepe is a big fan of Billiat and is said to be reluctant to see him leave. “The decision lies with him. He has the options but it is not an easy decision to make as Pirates are also seriously keen on his services,” said the source. “His heart, though, is with Sundowns but he will only stay if they are willing to meet his demands. He has achieved a lot with the club and wants to achieve more. The club know his demands.” Pitso Mosimane hasn’t completely ruled out the possibility of Billiat staying, saying he won’t stop trying to make him change his mind because “anything is possible”. “It is in Khama’s hands,” said Mosimane. “As Mamelodi Sundowns we love Khama. He’s been with us for five years and he knows he is loved at Mamelodi Sundowns. But you also have to understand and respect everybody’s wish, to say whether they are staying or going to move on.”
