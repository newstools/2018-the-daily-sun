American actress Tichina Arnold is set to join the cast of popular local prison drama series Lockdown for its third season. The Hollywood star best known for her roles on popular American sitcoms Martin and Everybody Hates Chris will play the role of Paulette, a new inmate. The 48 year-old is already in the country promoting the Mzansi Magic drama series and told the media that she is looking forward to broadening her horizons. “I wanted to leave America and see what other opportunities are out there that’s why I took the role in a South African show,” she said. “This role allows me to do a dramatic role and this is a great opportunity because I like to spread my wings as an actress. "I’m very excited and looking forward to working with my counterparts here especially Pamela Nomvete, these women are legends in their own right and I respect their work,” she added. The new season of Lockdown is set to hit TV screens on 9 July
