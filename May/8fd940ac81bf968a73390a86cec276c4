If there is anyone in the local entertainment industry who knows what Babes Wodumo is going through, that person is Cici. The award-winning singer, whose real name is Busisiwe Twala has firsthand experience with domestic violence and is currently fighting her own battle with her ex-boyfriend Arthur Mafokate. READ: INSIDE CICI’S TESTIMONY! The Iqiniso hit-maker whose own story is not too different from Babes’ recently told Trending SA that it is up to the Gqom queen to take action against her ex fiance’ Mampinstha. "They are not personal friends of mine. I wasn't aware but I had heard. You know people in the industry just talk, but at the end of the day, for me it's up to Babes Wodumo, the ball is in her court, we can be behind her and say all the things but if she's not saying anything then all that we do is in vain...it's up to her," she said. The songstress also reflected on her own experience with domestic violence and what motivated her to speak out. "I remember coming out and people were like: "Aren't you scared, you're a celebrity' and I was like: 'before I'm a celebrity, I'm actually human,” she said. “the people that actually follow my music need to understand that we are human and we experience the same things that they go through and so I would've not done justice to the people - to the young people and woman especially - to not come out and speak out about this, because they listen to my music, and what kind of example do I then set if I protect the perpetrator, so for me it was important," she added.
