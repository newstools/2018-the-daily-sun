CANCER does not discriminate. For many years, people ekasi did not know much about the disease. But on Tuesday a group of cops held a cancer awareness workshop at Algoa Park Police Station. Police officers from Bhisho, East London, King William’s Town, Queenstown, Graaff Reinet and Mthatha attended the workshop, along with pupils. Colonel Mxolisi Dyalivani said: “We came here to empower our staff with knowledge about killer diseases such as cancer. “We want to share as much information as we can about it. The team speaks about a number of deadly diseases but this year we are focusing on cancer. “We have called the South African Cancer Association and cancer survivors to tell us about their experience with the disease. “This is an attempt to help our staff deal with these dreadful diseases.” Dyalivani said cancer is just as deadly as criminals. “Cancer is affecting the police and the communities they serve. We will make sure we are visible and execute our mandate.” Cancer survivor Lavona Spies said: “When I was diagnosed with cancer, “I had to quit my job as a teacher. “Cancer affects every part of your life, including your marriage. “Luckily, my husband and children were supportive. I am grateful to God because I am healed.”
