Ajax Cape Town’s appeal to interdict the PSL promotion/relegation play-offs has been dismissed by Judge Raylene Keightley. It means that, unless they continue with a legal battle, Ajax are relegated to the NFD. The Urban Warriors were found guilty of fielding the ineligible Tendai Ndoro in the recently completed Premiership season and were docked seven log points as a result. Having initially finished in 15th, Ajax were set to face Black Leopards and Jomo Cosmos in the promotion/relegation play-offs but they have since been replaced by Platinum Stars, who originally finished bottom before Ajax were docked their points. Judge Keightley said: “To proceed to consider their (Ajax’s) application in these circumstances would not be in the general interest of all parties represented by the NSL (National Soccer League).However, Ajax will still apply to the court to review and set aside the ruling of SAFA's arbitrator Mokhari, which, if successful, could still cause the play-offs to be stopped and subsequently replayed.Judge Keightley has thus given the Cape-based club until 22 May 2018 to submit further papers to the court in order to proceed with their second appeal.
