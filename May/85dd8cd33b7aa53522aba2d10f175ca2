PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa says graduates must use their qualifications to change lives and earn their living. On Saturday he addressed students at the University of Mpumalanga’s graduation ceremony. “We need to transform our economy and make it more responsive to our people’s needs,” said Ramaphosa. “You will be part of a new generation of skilled young South Africans building an inclusive economy. “As you enter this new world, you must know that your families, communities and country have invested a lot in you. They look to you to reconstruct our country from the ruins of the past. “We want a society in which every person is a VIP and where only the poor and vulnerable get preferential treatment. Such a society begins with you. “As graduates of this university, you are at the forefront of a new generation of South Africans. “It is up to you to build a society that is truly non-racial. “Your words and deeds do not go unnoticed. Many aspire to achieve what you have. You are a light in your community. Do not hide that light or allow it to be extinguished. “Use that light to shine the path to a better future for all.” Human Settlements Minister Nomaindia Mfeketo and vice-chancellor Thoko Mayekiso were also at the ceremony.
