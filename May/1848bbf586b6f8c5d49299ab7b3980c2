THE cops have so far arrested 9 suspects for the pitch
invasion and violence at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on 21 April. Cops spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said that Â a further two (2) suspects handed themselves
over to detectives. Both suspects appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court on
Wednesday on charges of public violence. Naicker said: "Nolwethu Cokotha (29) and Zibongile
Njona (27) made a brief appearance in court and they were granted bail of R1000
each pending their next court appearance. They will join their seven other
co-accused when they appear in court on 25 May." "We are encouraged by the fact that these accused
have handed themselves over and are co-operating with investigators and
prosecutors. "We are confident that the outstanding suspects will
do the same," he said. He said warrants of arrest will be obtained to arrest
those that do not handed themselves over shortly. "We are appealing to those injured in the stadium
violence to also contact our investigating team. At this stage we have their names,
however we do not have their contact details. They are requested to contact
Detective Captain Reddy on 082 458 5630 or Detective Warrant Officer Mlungwana
on 082 662 7764."
