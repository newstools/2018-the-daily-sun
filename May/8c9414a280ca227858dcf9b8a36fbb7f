She worked part-time as a domestic worker while studying medicine full-time at the University of Kwazulu-Natal. Last month, Pamela Phumzile Sithole graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery. Sithole grew up in a place called Phoenix in Durban in a family of four raised by a divorced mother. "There were lot of challenges, the first being financial
circumstances at home. "I almost didn't come to a medical school because I did not
have any funding at home or from NSFAS, but somehow I eventually made it
through and managed to get NSFAS as well," she said. She started doing domestic work at the age of 14 in 2007 and continued with it even after she was admitted to study medicine because. Even after getting NSFAS, she still continued working part-time and every December for the past 10 years to raise money to support herself at university. She is now working as an intern doctor at Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital.
