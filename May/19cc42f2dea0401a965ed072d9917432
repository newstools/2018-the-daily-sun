BONGEKA Majola said she has lived in her shack most of her life. The 31-year-old mum from Ezinkawini Q section in Umlazi, south of Durban claimed the ward committee members were forcing her to leave the area. “They told me the eThekwini Municipality wanted to build toilets where my shack is built. Now they’ve threatened to demolish my shack. But we won’t move out.” Bongeka lives with her unemployed brother (30) and her three kids aged 13, nine and six. She said the shack belonged to her late mum. “I don’t know what to do.” Sindi Mkhize, a ward committee secretary, said Bongeka had agreed that her land could be used for the toilets. “She even agreed to sign the forms and take the R3 500 compensation,” said Mkhize. When Daily Sun asked Mkhize to send a copy of the forms Bongeka allegedly signed, she refused. Bongeka denied signing the forms or agreeing to take the money. Ethekwini municipal mayor Zandile Gumede spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said Bongeka must come to municipality if she cannot speak to the councillor. “If she fails to get help, she must come to the municipal offices in Durban and ask to speak to someone who will pass the matter to the mayor so that she will get help,” said Mthunzi.
