NOTHING clears up bad cellphone reception like SunPower. Just ask the residents of Lambani and Gunda-Tshilate villages outside Thohoayandou, Limpopo, who until last week had spent a month having to walk 5km to the next village to be able to make a call on their cellphones. But now they can again chat, text and use social media on their cellphones. This is after local man Albert Ramaphalala unlocked his gate and allowed technicians in to fix the cellphone signal tower located in his yard. Daily Sun published the villagers’ story. Talks were held between Albert and Telkom and an agreement was reached. Leigh-Ann Francis, a spokeswoman for Telkom, said: “The tower was built by Telkom in 1998 and has been standing on the property for 20 years. “Approval was received by Telkom prior to installation. At the time, Telkom did not commit to the provisioning of electricity as a precondition to the installation of the tower. After the matter arose, Telkom spoke to Albert to resolve the matter and access to the tower was granted.” Local villagers accused Albert of disconnecting the network tower for a month because he allegedly demanded that Telkom install an Apollo light as part of their agreement. Albert denied that he wanted the company to install a light in his yard. “We had some differences but I’m glad they came to talk to me last week to address the matter. I won’t mention what we discussed but we reached an agreement and I let them in to fix the signal,” he said. Tshifiwa Makhuvha (37) said: “We are happy the matter has been resolved. We had feared it would take longer. “Thank you, Daily Sun, for coming to our aid and publishing our story.”
