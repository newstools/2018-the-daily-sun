PASSENGERS, hawkers and taxi operators were left reeling in shock after a taxi boss was gunned at a Port Elizabeth Taxi Rank on Friday morning. Qondi Sizani (43) had just arrived at the taxi rank in a Border Alliance Taxi Association branded vehicle when his assailants got out of a car and fired shots in full view of other taxi operators. A taxi operator at the scene said: “Sizani owned taxis that covered the town and Walmer routes. He also held the position of inspector. “He was the one who checked if taxis were roadworthy and made sure that taxis were not overloaded. “He was a very strict person, but also down to earth. “We strongly believe this was a hit organised by greedy taxi bosses who did not want to follow the rules.” Sizani’s death comes after that of his elder brother, Mike (47), who was shot and killed in December in Motherwell NU13. “We are now concerned about our safety. We don’t know who is next,” said the taxi operator. Captain Johan Rheeder said police are investigating a case of murder. “The man, believed to be from Walmer, was shot in the head from close range. “Police cannot speculate on the cause of the shooting as no one wants to talk but the investigation continues. We appeal to anyone who might have witnessed the shooting to come forward. All information will be treated as confidential.” Sizani is just one in a long list of taxi bosses who have been gunned down in Port Elizabeth since 2008. Their murders have gone unsolved.
