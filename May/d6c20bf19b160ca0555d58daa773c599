THABANG Morobane has always been passionate about radio. After matric Thabang (42) registered for a teaching diploma at Kagisanong College in Bloemfontein. “After two years I realised I didn’t enjoy being in the classroom,” he said. He went back to school and studied for a bachelor of arts, majoring in psychology and public administration, at Vista University. While studying Thabang never forgot about his passion. He said for 15 years he would journey from Mokwena near Thaba Nchu to Lesedi FM in Bloemfontein to stand at the window and watch as presenters hosted their shows. He said when he was in grade 7 he met late Lesedi FM presenter Thabang Rampona. “He mentored me,” he said. Thabang, who loves singing choral music, said he started supplying Bloemfontein Botshabelo, Bloemfontein and Thaba Nchu FM (now Motheo) with CDs. “I was taking my music to the station when I learnt one of the presenters had not come to work,” said Thabang. “I was asked to fill in for him and was hired on the spot. I was in grade 11 at the time.” Eleven years ago he got the breakthrough he had been praying for. Today Thabang, a married father of two, is one of the most respected producers in Mzansi. He produces Jwale Ke Nako, a popular midday programme on Lesedi. Thabang works with veteran Sotho award-winning presenter Thuso Motaung and Nkunya Nkunya. Speaking to Daily Sun, he said his job was very demanding. He is a line manager, researches topics, and writes scripts for the presenters. “I’m grateful to have worked with most of the stations’ top presenters,” he said.
