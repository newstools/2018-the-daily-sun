Remember when we reported, almost two months ago, that Dr. Musa Mthombeni was ready to send his uncles over negotiate lobola for Thuso Mbedu? ICYMI: MUSA OFFERS TO SEND HIS UNCLES FOR THUSO! Well, seems like his mom is also ready to see this union happen. So much so that she is now taking matters into her own hands. Thuso and Musa have jokingly been flirting with each other on social media for about two or three months and fans are cheering for the couple to just get together already. For all we know, the two stars could already be in a secret relationship behind everyone’s back. Either way, Musa’s mom is ready and waiting for grandkids. Apparently she approached Thuso after Akhumzi’s funeral last week Saturday. “My mother cornered @ThusoMbedu after the funeral to ask her why she isn’t giving me a chance and HER grandchildren. My mom has reached a new level of needy,” Musa tweeted.
