AS IF it was not enough that Anna Maluleka’s son Mmuso (43) was in jail, cops raided her home on Wednesday morning. The gogo (78) from Winterveld, Tshwane, woke up to a loud banging sound coming from her front door. When she opened a group of heavily armed cops apparently barged in and demanded to search the house but instead ransacked her furniture. “They asked me where my son was but I couldn’t hear them, so they left and went to his girlfriend Aggy Masango (58).” Anna said they tore down the ceiling at Mmuso’s house in Ga-Rankuwa. Aggy said she was still sleeping when the cops barged into her room. “I was terrified. They told me they were looking for Mmuso. They said I had all the answers,” she said. “They asked me about guns, uniforms and where he was hiding. I tried telling them he was in jail but they continued to interrogate me.” Aggy’s son Meshack (28) was apparently in the cop van. “They’d tortured him, accusing him of hiding a man who already was in prison.” Captain Samuel Sebola said cops are investigating and no one has been arrested.
