A Zimbabwe woman got married in hospital this weekend - days
after her arm was bitten off in a crocodile attack near Victoria Falls, a
newspaper reported on Sunday. Zanele Ndlovu, a former national tennis player, married
Jamie Fox on Saturday in a chapel at Bulawayo's Mater Dei hospital where she
was treated for her injuries, reports the Sunday News. "This has never happened before and it is quite
exciting. You can tell people are all excited about this," a hospital
staffer told the paper. Lucky to be alive Pictures from the chapel service show Ndlovu in a wedding
dress, with the stump of her right arm in bandages. Her husband is pictured
putting a ring on her left hand, which is also partially bandaged, and she is
also seen signing a marriage certificate. A short video clip from the ceremony shows the moment the
groom kisses the bride. Ndlovu and Fox were in an inflatable boat in the Zambezi
River above the Victoria Falls when they were attacked by the crocodile last
week. "During the attack the crocodile gripped her arm and
ripped it off while her partner made frantic efforts to save her. They are
lucky to be alive though," an unnamed family member told the paper. Out of all animals, crocodiles were behind the biggest
number of fatal attacks on humans in Zimbabwe last year, with 21 killed by the
reptiles between January and December, according to a Chronicle report.
