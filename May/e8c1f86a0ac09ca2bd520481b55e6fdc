Cyprian Thekiso started suffering from fits and fainting when he was 15. Sangomas and prophets could not cure him. But when he visited his mum at her workplace in Gauteng, her employer recognised the signs and symptoms. He had epilepsy. Cyprian, originally from Marquard in the Free State, is now a child and youth care worker at Bona Lesedi Disability Centre in Diepsloot. He said his family at first took him to sangomas and prophets. “They all spoke the same language: somebody was jealous because I was a smart,” he said. They were all wrong, and a doctor gave him right medication. “My mother’s employer told her I had epilepsy and advised her to take me to a doctor,” he said. Today Cyprian is healthy and happy. He knows and understands his condition. “I do regular check-ups, associate myself with people who contribute positively to my life, pray a lot, exercise and play soccer.” At Lesedi Disability Centre, he empowers and promotes the rights of people with disabilities. “My responsibility is to teach children how to read and write.” He shares with them his story on the importance of taking medication. Before he joined the centre, he worked in retail stores as a volunteer caregiver. His condition didn’t allow him to cook because of the heat. “I can’t work in a noisy place because it causes dizziness, which could lead to fits,” he said. He said parents should look out for the following six symptoms of epilepsy: fallingchewingconfused memoryfaintingstiffness ) Seizeres.
