A PASTOR has been accused of robbing women ekasi through pyramid schemes. The pastor, who has apparently taken thousands of rands from the women, runs an investment business from a dark shack attached to an RDP in NU12A in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth. On Saturday morning at about 9am, six angry women invaded his shack and demanded that he pay them back money they invested in his scheme. He refused, however. Pastor Headman Goduka also refused to speak to the SunTeam, but he told the women he could not tell them when he would be able to pay them back because he was tied up in court cases. Fatima Nogampula (34) from KwaZakhele claimed that in 2016 she had invested R22 000 and she had been promised she would get back double that last year. Nikelwa Febana (55) from Motherwell claimed she invested R10 000, while Lizeka Fiki (46), also from Motherwell, claimed she had given the pastor R26 000 after being promised an interest rate of 100%. The policeâ€™s Colonel Priscilla Naidu advised the women to lay a charge.
