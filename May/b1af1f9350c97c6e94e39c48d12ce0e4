After Sandile Mantsoe was found guilty of murdering Karabo Mokoena, a new war started brewing on Twitter on Wednesday. Some people wanted to justify the killing of Karabo by blaming it on being a "slay queen or gold digger". They suggested Karabo is to blame because she did not leave the relationship as she was "benefiting financially". They said women are being killed because they prefer dating abusive men who have lots of money while overlooking broke guys. One such tweet was from Twitter user Mfundo_99 who tweeted: "Girls over look good guys with less income for those with the fat pockets when they get killed the society expects overlooked guys to feel sorry for them." Rashied404 tweeted: "Kasi women go for dangerous criminals and call gud guys "broke." When they get killed, they come online to harass those stupid apologetic "good" guys. It can never be me. Call us trash, I dont give a shxt! Take responsibility for yo actions & choices." But other Tweeps did not take these kind of statements lightly.
