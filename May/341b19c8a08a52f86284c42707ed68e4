FOUR Mnquma local council members have been suspended after defying provincial leaders’ instructions to elect Thabo Matiwane as mayor. Council speaker Zibuthe Mnqwazi, chief whip Zakhele Mkiva and councillor Luxolo Mgandela voted for Ndyebo Skelenge, instead of Matiwane. The ANC in the province had earlier requested mayor Thobeka Bikitsha to step down. A council meeting was held on 9 March to elect Matiwane, but Skelenge was elected mayor instead. A disciplinary committee, led by chairwoman Thokozile Sokanyile, ordered that Mnqwazi and Mkiva’s membership be suspended on 29 April for a period of five years. Skelenge’s membership was suspended for five years, wholly suspended for one year, on condition he was not charged with misconduct over the next year and that he resigned as mayor. Mgandela’s membership was suspended for five years, wholly suspended for one year, on condition he was not charged again for any act of misconduct over the next year. ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi told the People’s Paper the party won’t tolerate ill discipline. Service delivery in the embattled Eastern Cape municipality ground to a halt after the 2016 local government elections because, among other things, the municipality was caught up in infighting. Previous administrators – late municipal manager Sindile Tantsi, the late Sive Nombembe and Amathole region secretary Teris Ntuthu – were accused of tender deal corruption. A R10 million rubbish bags tender was illegally organised by Tantsi for Nombembe. Nthuthu, on other hand, is alleged to have influenced the decision to award the tender to Nombembe.
