SCULPTOR Avhatakali Mulaudzi has been sharpening his skills since he fell in love with art. The 39-year-old from Duthuni, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo said he realised his talent when he was still at primary school. Back then, he was painting portraits of people from his village. Avhatakali said: “Practising helped me improve. “But I don’t paint anymore. “Art is a type of storytelling. I always try to convey a message through my work. “The inspiration for my art comes to me in my dreams. “I see a certain object in my dreams and make a sculpture of it. “The images in my dreams are in my mind forever “That is why I don’t make mistakes when I start sculpting.” But as talented as he is, Avhatakali has been struggling to make a name for himself. He said he believes his village is not a place where artists can thrive. “I am in Venda, where people are only interested in farming and businesses of that nature. “When you tell them about art, they show absolutely no interest. I have nowhere to show my work.” He said he uses expensive material because he wants to make sculptures that looks real. “All I want is to find a place where I can show my work. “There are people who might want to buy my art but don’t know about me.” Avhatakali recently made a sculpture of President Cyril Ramaphosa. He said he hopes the sculpture will catch the eye of art lovers outside his village.
