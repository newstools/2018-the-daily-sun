A GANG accused Jojo Sibiya (27) of being a police informer. The six men claimed he showed cops where their stolen goods were so they kidnapped him. Jojo thought he was going to die when they took him to Evaton Cemetery in the Vaal. But then Jojo got lucky. One of the kidnappers was told to guard him but the thug fell asleep. Jojo untied himself and ran to the cemetery’s security guards to ask for help. The guards found the 24-year-old suspect sleeping on a tombstone and handed him over to the police. Police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya said the victim told them he was at home last Friday when the men arrived and demanded he leave with them. “They accused him of showing police where they hid stolen property. “Then they tied his hands and forced him into a car,” said Sibiya. “They left him under the watch of a fellow suspect but he fell asleep.” “The victim managed to set himself free and spotted security guards. “He ran to them to asked for help.” Sibiya said the guards took Jojo and the suspect to Evaton Police Station, where a case of kidnapping was opened. The suspect was later transferred to Kagiso, Mogale City. The rest of the gang is on the run. SunLanders who have information about the suspects are urged to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
