THE kids were playing hide and seek as they always did. Little Lebohang Letebele (5) played along and soon his friends struggled to find him It was only much later that he was found dead in a trench filled with water. The tragedy happened on Thursday at Maemaneng kasi in Marquard, Free State. It seems as if Lebohang wanted to hide but fell into the trench and drowned, while his friends kept calling his name for him to come out of hiding. His gogo, Mamokete Letebele (50), was in shock when his friends told her of his death. “When they came to my home and told me something had happened to my grandson, I feared the worst because I saw him dead in my dreams. “But I thought it couldn’t be true as he was still such a young boy. “I am saddened by his death. He was still so young and dreamed of becoming a soldier one day. “I had a dream last week that Lebohang died but did not take it seriously. The dream came after his father had a quarrel with his mum and left to stay with one of his friends. “The family has been left traumatised over what had happened. “I would like to thank the residents who tried to save his life. “May his soul rest in peace. I will forever miss him,” Mamokete said. Neighbour Dieketseng Mosebeoa (24) said: “I got the news from two young boys who were singing that he was dead. I asked them who died and they showed me Lebohang’s body. “I took him out of the trench and tried to do CPR but it was too late. I called the ambulance and the police.” Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini confirmed the incident and said an inquest docket was opened.
