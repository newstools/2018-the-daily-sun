THREE police office were arrested on Thursday for theft and defeating the ends of justice. The cops are accused of stealing money that was scattered all over the ground following a dramatic cash-in-transit heist. They appeared in the Mhala Magistrate Court in Mpumalanga on Friday. The lawmen stationed at Mhala, Calcutta and Bushbuckridge cop shops were each released on R2 000 bail. The matter was postponed to 28 June. The warrant officer (52), a constable (31) and a reservist constable (38) were the first to arrive at the scene after a gang of armed men bombed a cash van.This was on a busy road near a tavern in Arthurstone. Residents told the police that the three cops collected the notes and fled in a police VW minibus. Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma said the three cops were nabbed in Dwarsloop with some of the money in their possession. “We thank the community for blowing the whistle,” said Zuma. “The duty of the police at a crime scene is to safeguard and protect the property and all other exhibits lying around. “We believe that the arrest of these police members will serve as a deterrent to the other members who might be tempted to cross the line.”
