THREE people were killed during a taxi violence in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni on Wednesday morning. Seven other people were reported to have been injured during the incident. Cops from the Public Order Policing were escorting Tsakane taxi drivers to the offices of Greater Brakpan Taxi Association in the Brakpan CBD when the incident occurred.  Reports suggest that violence started on Tuesday when Tsakane taxi drivers embarked on a strike. They held a meeting on Wednesday, before marching to the association offices. It has been reported that when they arrived at the association offices shots were fired and Brakpan cops were called for backup. Cops spokesman Captain Pearl Van Staad said the cops have arrested seven heavily armed men who will now face attempted murder and murder charges.
