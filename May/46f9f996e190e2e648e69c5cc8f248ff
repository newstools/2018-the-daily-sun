WATCH out city dwellers! Animals like birds we’re used to living with in peace have started to turn on us, in vicious attacks that sometimes result in the human’s death. Many reports from around the world point to the cause of the attacks as being these animals’ newfound love for human junk food. Some experts have even suggested that these animals have got hooked on the sugar found in these foods and would do absolutely anything to have them. Other animals like baboons, which are naturally aggressive towards humans, have gone on the offensive against humans in recent years. In the Cape, baboons have become so smart to humans’ ways they’ve learnt to throw rocks at us and even how to open car doors. But as Conservation Magazine points out, far more human deaths are caused by bees, mosquitos, spiders, snails, snakes and deer. WATCH SEAGULLS ATTACK:   WATCH BABOONS ATTACK:
