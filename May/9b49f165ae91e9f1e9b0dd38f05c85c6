THE Walter
Sisulu University student Sibongile Mani, who allegedly spent R818 000 of the money that was deposited into her account, was arrested on Tuesday. R14-million was
mistakenly paid into Mani's account from National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). It is
reported that she handed herself to the HAWKS offices in East London. She allegedly appeared briefly at the East London Magistrates Court
on charges of theft. The case was postponed to next month. Mani made headlines when she allegedly went on a spending spree
after the equivalent of $1m was paid into her IntelliCard account in June 2017,
which is run by the company Intellimali. She was supposed to have received R1 400 which is the limit that
can be spent at certain grocers and book shops. Instead, she allegedly went on a spending spree and the error was
only picked up in August 2017. The balance of the money has been retrieved, but now she is liable
for the outstanding amount.
