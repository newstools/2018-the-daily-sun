International R&B crooner, Anthony Hamilton is making his way back to South Africa later this year. After several successful performances in the country a few years ago, the Grammy-award winning musician will descend on our shores once again. Soulful Night with Anthony Hamilton will go down at the Sun Arena, Time Square in Menlyn Maine, Tshwane on 24 August 2018. The ‘King Of Soul’, as he is known, will bring his timeless classics Best Of Me, Never Love Again, Pass Me Over, Her Heart, Pray For Me, and Freedom just to mention a few, to his super fans. Anthony received his 12th Grammy-award nomination in 2017, for Best Traditional R&B Performance, courtesy of his hit single, What I’m Feeling, which features his official backing vocalists, The HamilTones. Soulful Night with Anthony Hamilton follows last month’s Soulful Night with Kenny Lattimore which took place at the same venue on SA’s Freedom Day, 27 April. “Soulful Night aims to celebrate women in Mzansi through songs and honour them, reminding them that they are loved and appreciated. Soulful Night With Anthony Hamilton will be one for the books and I would like to thank our supporters for their love and support thus far, let’s put on our dancing shoes for a night for the books,” said Mandisa Makalima, co-owner of Soulful Night and event organizer. Tickets for the show are available right now from Computicket, Shoprite and Checkers and range from R250 to R1 050, with VIP costing R1 550 and VVIP going for R1 850.
