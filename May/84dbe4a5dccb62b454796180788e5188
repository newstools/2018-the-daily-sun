SOUTH African Police Union president Mpho Kwinika said in Seshego, Limpopo, yesterday that the country can’t become a gangster’s paradise. “We demand no parole for police killers and strict bail conditions for suspected police killers,” he said. He handed over a memorandum of demands during a march by hundreds of union members and called on the police minister to introduce tougher laws to curb cop killings. “We’re calling on the government to declare police killings a national disaster,” he told the People’s Paper. “The killings of police officials should come to an end – not tomorrow, but now. “If we fail to protect our protectors, then the freedom that was so hard won will be taken away from our societies by criminals.” He said cops were members of society, too, and that communities had to help stopthe senseless killings. South African Federation of Trade Unions deputy general secretary, Moleko Phakedi, told Daily Sun: “There should be harsher laws in place to protect police officers and enable them to defend themselves.” Seshego police station’s Vusi Nyalunga, accepting the memorandum, said the cops’ grievances would be addressed at national level.
