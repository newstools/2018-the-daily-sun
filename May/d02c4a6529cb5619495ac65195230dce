MURDERED ANC councillor Siphiwe Montlha was with a friend when he was shot on Tuesday. The friend was rushed to hospital after also being shot during the attack. He has been discharged but is in hiding as he fears for his life. On Wednesday ANC Tshwane deputy chairman Mapiti Matsena and other party members went to pay their respects to Montlha’s family at Ext 4 in Soshanguve, Tshwane. Matsena told Daily Sun the friend was shot in one leg as he tried to drive off in Montlha’s car. Montlha was murdered outside his home on Tuesday evening. His death has left his community in shock. Residents said the ward 37 councillor was always available when they had problems. They held a meeting at a community hall on Wednesday to discuss how they could help his family. Matsena said they did not want to speculate on whether his murder was politically motivated or not. He said police investigations would reveal the motive. Daily Sun tried to speak to the injured friend, but his father said he was still in shock and traumatised. He said he could not speak to the media as he feared his identity might be revealed. The father said his son was afraid the evil thugs might come for him. Gauteng police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said cases of murder and attempted murder are being investigated and no arrests have yet been made.
