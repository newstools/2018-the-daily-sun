RESIDENTS of Dubai Village in Tshwane fear for their safety. They’ve clashed with the people of Ga-Tsebe, another village in Mabopane. The villages have had to deal with power cuts that sometimes damage appliances. People of Ga-Tsebe said Dubai villagers steal their electricity. Dubai residents have no electricity or water, and they accused Councillor Tshepo Motaung of advising them to make izinyoka. Elevents months later, Ga-Tsebe residents are gatvol. Rogers Chauke (49) said: “We know what we’re doing is wrong. “But all we want is for the councillor to fix the problem and let us have electricity.” Rogers said they were scared other villagers would destroy their homes if the problem wasn’t solved. Municipal spokesman Sam Mgobozi said: “When people steal electricity, they’re breaking the law and it makes it harder for us to provide it to other townships.” He said the municipality will find a solution. But Motaung said he never advised people to make izinyoka. He said Dubai residents were occupying land illegally. “I’m working to have that place formalised, and then we’ll work on service delivery. “They should be arrested for stealing.”
