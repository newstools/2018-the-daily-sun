WITHOUT a thought for his own safety, Mamoudou Gassama
took just seconds to reach the child in a spectacular rescue captured on film
and viewed millions of times on social networks. Watch the footage below! Gassama was hailed as a “real life Spider-Man” on social
media following the daring rescue. The incident took place at around 8pm on Saturday in
northern Paris. Film of the rescue shows Gassama (22) pulling himself up
from balcony to balcony with his bare hands as a man on the fourth floor tries
to hold on to the child by leaning across from a neighbouring balcony. Firefighters arrived at the scene to find the child had
already been rescued. "Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit
and who had the courage to go and get the child," a fire service
spokesperson told AFP. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo praised the young migrant on
Twitter for his "act of bravery", as well as phoning him personally
to "thank him warmly". "He explained to me that he had arrived from Mali a
few months ago dreaming of building his life here. "I told him that his heroic act is an example to all
citizens and that the city of Paris will obviously be very keen to support him
in his efforts to settle in France," she added. The young Malian will next be honoured for his brave
rescue by French President Emmanuel Macron who has invited him to the Elysee
Palace on Monday, his office told AFP. Tracked down by reporters 24 hours after the heroic
rescue, Gassama said he had acted without thinking. "I saw all these people shouting, and cars sounding
their horns. I climbed up like that and, thank God, I saved the child," he
said. "I felt afraid when I saved the child... (when) we
went into the living room, I started to shake, I could hardly stand up, I had
to sit down," he added. According to initial inquiries by the authorities, the
child's parents were not at home at the time.
