PRUDENCE Tshikota (19) and Paseka Moraka (26) were known as Romeo and Juliet. But no one in their kasi of Klipgat, northern Tshwane, expected the couple’s fairytale love affair to end in tragedy. Their families and friends are still in shock following their sudden death on Sunday afternoon. Neighbours and passersby said they saw smoke coming out of Paseka’s shack. When they went to investigate, they heard a sound inside the shack. They tried to put out the fire, but the damage had already been done. Prudence was declared dead on the scene and Paseka died in hospital on Monday. When Daily Sun visited the area on Wednesday, some residents claimed to have seen Paseka buying petrol at a local petrol station where he worked. Prudence’s gogo Leah Tshikota (70) said the last time she saw or heard from her was when she was coming back from a study group on Sunday. “She dropped her books off at home and told us she was going to see a friend. “She said she would be back, but little did we know it would be the last time we would see her alive.” Paseka’s aunt Mary Shabangu (49) described him as a happy, loving person. She said his death had caused a lot of pain in the family. “It broke our hearts because he was still young and had his whole life ahead of him,” she said. She said the family won’t comment on allegations that their son may have been responsible. One of Prudence’s teachers at Fumane Secondary School described her as hardworking and respectful. The teacher said he couldn’t believe she had died. Klipgat police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Amandsa Funani said an inquest docket was opened. She said they heard rumours the boyfriend might have had a hand in the fire. “Although we heard about the boy being responsible for the deaths, we can’t confirm anything until the police have concluded their investigation,” Funani told the People’s Paper.
