COPS became suspicious when they spotted an overloaded Toyota Tazz driving around the farms at night. THE cops were patrolling around farms in the Eastern Cape when they came across the car. But what shook the cops is that the car was not filled with human passengers. There were six sheep stuffed in the back passenger seat and in the boot of the car. And the men did not have any legal document to transport the sheep so they were arrested. The two men are now facing charges of stock theft and will both appear before Cartchart Magistrate's Court soon.
