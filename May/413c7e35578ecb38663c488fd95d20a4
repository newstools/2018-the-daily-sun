HOSTEL residents are demanding that municipal workers close a deep trench they left open before their kids drown in it. Nonzame Mbutini (49), who lives at Hostel One, said it’s usually a struggle to get the Mangaung municipality to deliver services. So everyone was overjoyed when workers arrived two months ago to fix a leaking water pipe. However, they left a deep hole behind and residents have been struggling to get the municipality to fix the mess since then. Making matters worse, the hole has filled with water and now poses a health risk. “They make our lives miserable as we have to monitor our kids because we’re scared they may drown,” said Nonzame. “We always keep our doors and windows closed because of the stinking water. We are forced to live like pigs.” Another resident Victoria Senti (39) said the hole was in front of her door and she feared her three-year-old son would drown if she allowed him to play outside. “There are a lot of mosquitoes and the smell coming from the water is killing us,” she said. “I have been living at this hostel for more than eight years and I’ve noticed the municipal workers often leave without finishing their work. They only attend to a matter once someone is dead.” Municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said they were not aware of the hole. “We will send our team out and we promise the community we will close the trench.”
