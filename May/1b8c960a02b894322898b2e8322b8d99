MAKATSENG Mathiba’s life fell apart last Monday when her house mysteriously caught fire. Her husband and son were in the house when the fire started. Her son survived but her husband died in hospital. The 45-year-old Makatseng, who is from Marimba Gardens in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, said her heart bleeds each time she looks at the gutted house. She can’t afford to fix it. The unemployed mum of three said she’s been trying to get donations, with no success. “My husband was not working at the time he died,” she said. “It hurts to see my children without a proper home.” Her eldest daughter’s self-esteem has been badly affected by the fact that the family no longer has a proper home. “She keeps asking when I’ll fix the house, but I don’t know what to say because I don’t work.” She appealed to Good Samaritans to donate building material. “I went to a sangoma, who told me the fire was vutha. The blaze was uncontrollable,” she toldDaily Sun.
