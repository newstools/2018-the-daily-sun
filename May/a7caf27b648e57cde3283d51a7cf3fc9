AJAX Cape Town coach, Muhsin Ertugral, has thrown his weight behind his Mamelodi Sundowns counterpart, Pitso Mosimane, to “again” represent the country with distinction in the African Champions League. This is why the Ajax coach, who has problems of his own at the foot of the Absa Premiership table, said the Brazilians deserve to win the 2017-18 title. Downs wrapped up the season at the weekend when they blasted Ajax with a 3-1 defeat at Atteridgeville’s Lucas Moripe Stadium, to clinch the title with one round of matches remaining. “Sundowns are not just competitive in the PSL, but also in Africa,” said the Turkish coach. “The way Sundowns play is marvellous to watch. Credit should be given to their technical team for assembling such a quality team.” On his side’s chances of surviving relegation, Ertugral said all they are thinking about now is to win against Kaizer Chiefs in their last league match at Athlone Stadium on 12 May (3pm) – and take it from there. Ajax are currently second bottom with 31 points – two points behind 14th-placed SuperSport United and 13th-placed Polokwane City. They are three points behind Baroka FC who are visiting fellow relegation troubled Matsatsantsa a Pitori in their last league game on the same day at Lucas Moripe Stadium. “All we have to do is to beat Chiefs and see what happens,” said Ertugral. “We are very dangerous at home where we have beaten big teams like Orlando Pirates (3-1) this season. “We play good football at home.” The 58-year-old made it clear that they are not banking on the outcome of the Tendai Ndoro saga, which many believe can cost them points should the case go against them. “We signed Ndoro and we are supposed to be playing him. The PSL gave us permission to play him. To be honest we missed his qualities against Sundowns and the next coming against Chiefs.”
