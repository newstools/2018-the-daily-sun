PEOPLE arrived for a civilised discussion of a hot topic but they got more than they bargained for. In the end, the debate on the expropriation of land without compensation ended in insults and scuffles. The event took place at the Unisa campus in Tshwane on Monday. Cope leader Mosiuoa Lekota, the ANC’s Ronald Lamola, EFF’s Mandisa Mashego, Black First Land First’s Andile Mngxitama and DA’s Gwen Ngwenya were among those who tried to present their views on the controversial issue. Just as the audience had settled into their seats, Lekota turned up the heat in the debate. “I was brought up by the ANC and I’m still ANC by the way,” he said as many reacted with shock while others clapped. Lekota had to stop his address several times as he was constantly disrupted. The former ANC stalwart spoke about how settlers and Africans fought over land. “People say our land was stolen and that is belittling us. We fought wars and we were defeated,” he said. Moments after Lekota spoke, the debate moved from being civilised to a chaotic mess. Lamola said his party had always viewed the land question as very important for achieving the means of production. “The position of the ANC has always been very clear that the land belongs to the majority of the African people,” he said, as the audience booed. He was given extra time to finish his argument but he stormed out of the venue. Mngxitama said they wanted the land and they wanted all of it. “The original sin is the sin of land theft and that makes all of us who fight for land true believers of the gospel of God. “We know the amendment of the Constitution will not be the end and will not give us land. We must exhaust the constitutional process.”
