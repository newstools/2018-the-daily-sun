“I NEVER thought I’d stand and talk about Akhumzi. I thought he’d be the one to talk about me at my funeral.” These were the words of Akhumzi Jezile’s uncle Lizani at a memorial service for the 29-year-old actor and TV producer at Rhema Bible Church in Joburg yesterday. Lizani said: “He was a nephew, a friend and everything. I’m so hurt. I can’t even express myself.” Singer and TV personality Thandekiso Rolisang said: “The life we’re gathered here for is one we may feel we were robbed of, but the thing we will do is celebrate it.” She described him as a humble person who loved gospel, which was played throughout the service. Adelaile Joshua-Hill from production company Urban Brew said he made everyone smile. Clara Nzima from SABC1 said the entertainment industry had lost a very talented young man. “Akhumzi left Joburg with friends to go to the Eastern Cape, not knowing they wouldn’t come back. I encourage all of us to live in the moment because we don’t know when it’s time,” she said. SunBuzz editor Lerato Matsoso spoke on behalf of Akhumzi’s friends in the media. Pastor Khaya Mthethwa delivered the sermon. Gauteng Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation MEC Faith Mazibuko said: “He was one of those young people who always made sure our African language doesn’t lose sense. “It’s not only your loss but it’s a loss for us all as a nation. We thank the Jezile family for bringing us this amicable person. Like his name Akhumzi, he really built a nation through his talent.” Akhumzi died in a car accident. His funeral will take place at the same church on Saturday. He will be buried at West Park Cemetery.
