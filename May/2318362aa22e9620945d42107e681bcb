EASTERN Cape Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana met South African National Civic Organisation leaders in Mthatha yesterday. This came after residents marched to King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality’s offices on Wednesday, demanding that the area’s taxi ranks be reopened. The ranks were shut down in March to try and stop taxi violence, which had claimed more than 60 lives since 2016. The Chatham, Jubilee and Marikana ranks have since been reopened. “We don’t have a problem with opening more ranks but processes must be followed. We can’t open them overnight. “There are three ranks and we have a team that will advise us on which ones must be opened,” said Tikana. She said one rank in Mthatha Plaza and another in Circus Triangle would be opened. However, the underground rank will remain closed. “It’s become easy for thugs to shoot from that rank. We want to listen to the pleas of community members but what is critical is for commuters to travel safely,” she said. Nkonki Mazwe, deputy president of the South African National Taxi Council, said the loss of 60 lives was embarrassing. “We will have to come to Eastern Cape and help the MEC stop this violence. There are some people who don’t want peace. We don’t support criminality,” he said. “Some of our members were part of the march but they denied that.” He said Santaco apologised to those who lost relatives to taxi violence.
