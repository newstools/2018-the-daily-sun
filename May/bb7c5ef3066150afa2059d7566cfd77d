Denel’s CEO has quit the parastatal. The CEO of Denel, Zwelakhe Ntshepe, has reigned with
immediate effect, Denel has said on Tuesday. Citing “personal reasons for leaving the company”, Ntshepe
has been replaced by Head of Aeronautics Michael Kgobe as interim president. “The Denel board of directors has accepted the resignation
of the group’s Chief Executive Officer, Zwelakhe Ntshepe, with effect from
today,” the parastatal said. Kgobe has been with Denel since May 2000. A background in aeronautical engineering, Kgobe was
appointed Chief Executive of Denel Aviation, the precursor to Denel
Aeronautics, in 2010. Ntshepe has worked for Denel for over 20 years and filled
his position six months ago. Ntshepe is hailed for overseeing the successful turnaround
of the division and accelerated growth to becoming one of the highest
performing divisions of the Denel Group. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan appointed a new
interim board for Denel in April. The board is chaired by former ACSA CEO Monhla Hlahla.
