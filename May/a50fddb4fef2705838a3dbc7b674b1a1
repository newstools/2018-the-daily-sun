RAPE accused Kgomotso Mahole will know his fate next Wednesday after being found guilty in the Mhala Regional Court on Monday. The 21-year-old from Zoeknog Village near Acornhoek, Mpumalanga raped three kids, aged between six and eight, after they went to buy some snacks at his spaza in 2015. The court heard that the accused offered one of the victims free items after raping her. Mahole told the court the parents of the kids were jealous of him because he runs a successful spaza. “I never raped those kids. Their parents just painted me black because I run a successful spaza. All they want is to tarnish my image in the community,” said Mahole. Prosecutor Matume Maakie told the court the accused didn’t acknowledge his actions. He asked the magistrate to find Mahole guilty as the kids were still young. Magistrate Elmarie Theron postponed the case to next Wednesday for sentencing. Mahole was kept in jail.
