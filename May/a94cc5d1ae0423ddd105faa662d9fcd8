The Blouberg Municipality in
Limpopo was robbed and cops have launched a massive manhunt for the unknown
armed suspects. It is alleged that a silver
Mercedes Benz drove past the municipal building, which led to two security officers that
were on duty to get suspicious of the vehicle's strange movements and decided to
inspect it out. "To their shock six
suspects confronted them from the backyard and pointed them with firearms. The
female guard armed with a service pistol, surrendered and the intruders
disarmed her and took both their cell phones," Police spokesperson Constable
Maphure Manamela said. He said the suspects
ordered the security officers to the main building where they broke the door to
gain access to the safe. The guards were kept
outside the building tied up under watch, while other suspects were grinding
the safe using unknown instruments. "The ordeal continued
for some hours until the safe was finally opened." Manamela said the suspects got away with an
undisclosed amount of money. He said there were no shots
fired and no injuries sustained in the process. The police make an appeal
to anyone with information which can lead to the arrest of these suspects to contact
the investigating officer Constable Rufus Ledwaba at 072 5810526.
