A NEW gang has moved into the squatter camp and is terrorising residents. But the residents of Mohlakeng squatter camp on the West Rand are fighting back in a brutal way. They allegedly killed two men suspected to be members of the gang on Wednesday. “We live in terror because of 13 men who recently moved into our kasi,” claimed a woman. “They rape women in front of their husbands, then beat up the men.” The woman claimed that two women were repeatedly raped by 10 members of the gang on Saturday. “We are afraid to report cases to the police. When you tell the police your name, they tell these people who you are.” Another woman told Daily Sun that they could not sleep on Wednesday night. “We heard screams and gunshots. We heard them kicking down doors.” One of the men said they tried to corner the gang on Wednesday, but they were not successful. “We tried fighting back, but people ended up getting badly beaten. One man was hacked with a panga. They also broke both arms of a gogo who was sitting in her shack. When the SunTeam arrived at the squatter camp there were two police vans. Moments later the residents chased the gang members, who hid in the trees near the reeds and the police vans were nowhere to be seen. One man said: “We had no choice. The police left us. If we don’t kill them they will come back for us. We need to find the rest of the gang.” Gauteng police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini did not comment at the time of going to print.
