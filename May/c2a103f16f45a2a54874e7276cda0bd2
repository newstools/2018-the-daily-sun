THE family of abducted teenage boy Katlego Marite is living in hope that he will be brought back home safely. The 13-year-old teen from Extension 3 in Tasbet Park, Emalahleni in Mpumalanga was kidnapped by three unknown men on Sunday afternoon. Katlego was playing with other kids not far from his home, when three men travelling in a golden Toyota Corolla stopped next to them. One of the men, dressed in black with a green jacket, allegedly grabbed Katlego and forced him into the vehicle before driving off. Katlego’s friends immediately ran to his mum and told her about the incident. Mum Merriam Marite (55) said they are struggling to sleep not knowing where their son is in this cold weather. “We have been waiting patiently for calls or messages, but nothing has come up. This is really frustrating us. I thought by now the kidnappers would have approached us but there has been no word,” she said. Merriam said what worries her is that Katlego was not wearing any shoes when he was abducted and the kidnappers’ demands were not within their reach. The kidnappers are alleged to have left a letter demanding that the family pay a ransom of 15 Bitcoins. One bitcoin currently equals about R102 632,52, which brings the ransom to just over R1,5 million. The note also asked the family not to involve the police. “They wanted us to have deposited 15 Bitcoins by Monday, but we have no idea what Bitcoins are or where we can get them.” Katlego’s sister, Masego Marite (28), said she was trying to be strong for the sake of her parents. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a case of kidnapping was opened.
