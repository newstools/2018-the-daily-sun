Instagram model and video vixen Nocole Nyaba, has reaffirmed AKA’s statements that rubbished the rumours that indicated the two were seeing each other behind then girlfriend Bonang’s back. After Nicole posted a picture with the Supa Mega’s flashy BMW i8 in the background, cheating rumours started making the rounds and threatened his relationship with Bonang at that point. However, in a recent interview on Trending SA, Nicole has also rubbished those rumours and has explained the picture that started it all. “First of all, I was not AKA’s side chick, I was not the main, I was nothing to him,” she explained “Unfortunately, I didn’t know what Kiernan’s car would look like...to be honest with the whole of SA, I really didn’t know that was his car, I only found out afterwards when everyone was making a fuss about it. I had never been in that car.” Many on Twitter were not convinced by the 26 year-old’s explanation though. Check out some of the tweets.
