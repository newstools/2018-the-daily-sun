FIFTEEN families from KwaXimba Village near Isithumba Mountain, in the Valley of 1000 Hills in KZN, want to move urgently. They fear they might die because of a giant granite rock that seems to cause tremors in the area. The latest incident was at the beginning of March. Nombuso Bhengu (36) told Daily Sun they live in constant fear because they don’t know when they will experience another tremor again. “It is scary. We first hear an enormous cracking sound and feel as if our houses are moving. Even though we don’t see rocks falling from the mountain, we feel unsafe and fear the tremor will cause our houses to cave in and bury us alive.” Another resident, Bongiwe Duma (44) said even if they were to be moved tomorrow, they wouldn’t hesitate for a minute. “We fear for our lives. “This thing has been happening every five years since we arrived in this area in the early 1980s. “In previous years, we didn’t pay attention to it because there were just small cracking sounds, coupled with a tremor of a few seconds but lately, the sound is louder and the tremors last a few minutes which makes us think it’s getting serious,” said Bongiwe. Councillor Musa Mkhize said he is managing the relocation of the families to a safer place. “We are working on the matter with co-operative governance and traditional affairs. “We are treating it with urgency because the surveyors that came to examine the area recently confirmed these families are in danger.” Co-operative governance spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said he tried to get details from the disaster unit. “I have been told the unit is working tirelessly on the matter relating to the KwaXimba families. “Right now, they are in the middle of a technical study to check the risks faced by families living near this rock. “I advise them not to panic as the technicians are on top of their game and the department promises to get them all the intervention they need.”
