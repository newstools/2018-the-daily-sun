IT PROMISES to be goals galore on Saturday when Mamelodi Sundowns’ reserves take on the Kaizer Chiefs youngsters in the inaugural Multichoice Diski Shield final. The tournament kicked off last month and culminates in this weekend’s final that will see the two teams lock horns at Tembisa’s Makhulong Stadium (3pm). Chiefs have scored 12 goals in four matches while Sundowns have found the back of the net nine times in the same number of matches. This is a sure sign that more of the same could be on the menu on Saturday. Sundowns coach David Notoane says they draw inspiration from the first team. They want to win the Diski Shield to follow in the footsteps of the seniors who’ve just won the Absa Premiership title. He said: “We always take our inspiration from the success of the first team. When we won the MultiChoice Diski Challenge in 2016-17 the first team won Champions League and Super Cup. We want to make it another week of joy for Masandawana.” Notoane’s charges have conceded in all their matches but this does not worry the former Black Leopards mentor, as he insists they want nothing but goals this time around. He stated: “We have the capability to score goals with Thabang Sibanyoni, Keletso Makgalwa and Keabetswe Mokoena in the form of their lives. “We know where we stand as a team, the biggest challenge for us has always been keeping clean sheets. If you don’t concede, you increase your chances of victory. “But at Sundowns we play to attack, we never play to defend. I always tell the boys it’s better to win the game 5-4 than losing 1-0 because we are an attack-minded institution.”
