WORLD Boxing Federation (WBF) world flyweight champion Jackson “M3” Chauke says his unbeaten challenger, WBF All Africa flyweight champion Mpho “Turbo” Seforo, will pay for trash-talking him on social media. The 33-year-old Chauke from Ivory Park, Ekurhuleni, is set to put his crown on the line against Seforo in July. Although the talented pugilists have not even signed their fight contracts, they have already started trading verbal jabs on social media. Seforo has been trash-talking Chauke since he won the title against Sihle Jelwane in March. He has called the champion ugly and an old man, a “joke” who went to Olympics but failed to bring home a medal. Andre Thysse of Real Steel Promotions, who will stage the fight, says trash-talk is good to promote the contest but he thinks Seforo is doing it wrong by disrespecting the champion. “Maybe Seforo is trying to promote the fight and upset Chauke but he is doing it the wrong way by disrespecting the champion.” The former Olympian says the challenger is excited about the bout and now wants to gain popularity at his expense. “I will punish this boy for the things he has been saying about me. He is still wet behind the ears and I call his act immature and irresponsible. He will pay dearly for his remarks. “I hope he is able to back that up with a steady performance in the ring,” said Chauke. “My record speaks for itself. I have worked very hard to be where I am. Seforo will regret the bad stuff he said about me once we step in the ring. He must ask Jelwana what I do to young boys,” he said. Chauke has an impressive record of 15 wins, one defeat and a draw, while his rival is unbeaten in eight outings and has one draw. Seforo was not available for comment at the time of going to print.
