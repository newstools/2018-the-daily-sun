The students of Letaba TVET College in Maake Campus outside Tzaneen have boycotted classes. They vowed not to return to classes until the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has refunded all students. The students have not been to class since 7 May. One of the Students representatives Khomotso Mohale said that in 2017 learners were told to pay 50% and that NSFAS will pay the rest . The students now want their money to be refunded. Mohale told Daily Sun that another burning issue is that the college is providing them with dirty water . "We requested our CEO Benjamin  Mushona to address this issue but he just disappeared," said Mohale. Their other demands includes  safety and security at the school as they alleged that students get raped. "There is also a shortage of lectures and we want transport and accommodation allowances from NSFAS,"  said Mohale. He said the suspension of the strike will depend on the mass meeting that all student will have on Wednesday.   Letaba TVT College CEO Benjamin Mushona of the College told SABC current Affairs that they are in process of refunding all students.
