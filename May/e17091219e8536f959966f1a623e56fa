MOROCCO may be bidding to host the 2026 World Cup, but the country will have to do so without the help of South Africa. This is according to Sport Minister Tokozile Xasa, who has reiterated the government’s stance on who Mzansi will be backing to host the 2026 football showpiece. And it certainly won’t be Morocco! South Africa has been vocal about Morocco’s continued occupation of Western Sahara, which is viewed globally as a colonial policy. The North African country is up against the joint bid of powerhouses USA, Canada and Mexico for the rights to stage the world’s biggest football competition. Safa president Danny Jordaan recently welcomed the Morocco delegation, which included former Senegal striker El Hadji Diouf, and said it would be great for Africa to have a second bite of the World Cup cherry. Without directly endorsing either bid, Jordaan further said that with good support Morocco could emulate South Africa, who hosted the 2010 event. But the government appears to have taken a dim view of these developments. “There are many world sporting events, which African countries are bidding to host – where you can even hear Dr Danny Jordaan saying we will assist Morocco in their bid to host the World Cup?” said Xasa. “Government is clear on this one. Even when you are a sporting body, you need to understand the country’s agenda. It cannot be that because you have experience in Fifa matters, you go to a country that goes against your country’s mandate. As the government we are very clear that we can’t support Morocco.” A Safa statement reads: “Safa wants to reiterate that no decision has been taken at this stage on who to support. We hope this clarifies Safa’s position going forward.”
