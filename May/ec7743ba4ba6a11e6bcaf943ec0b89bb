Only 35 days left and the Gauteng Provincial Government has not
yet made payments to the families of the mental health patients who died at
unregistered NGOs. This comes after the former chief Justice, Dikgang Moseneke set 19
June as the deadline for his arbitration award. This was revealed by the Gauteng Premier David Makhura in the
Gauteng Legislature, according to the DA MPL, Jack Bloom. Bloom said Makhura advised the Legislature that the process is
underway to verify bank details of all the beneficiaries and validate new
applications. He however, assured that they will meet the timeframe set by
Moseneke. It is understood that new claimants are also being accepted, and
this is likely to increase the total cost of claims. The arbitration awarded R1.2 million which include R20,000 for
their funeral expenses and  R180,000 for
psychological trauma. Bloom said: “It is unclear where the money will be found to pay
for this as Makhura told the Provincial Executive Council that they are
?nalising all consultations with national Department of Health on this matter
and an update report will be given to the legislature in due course. “I am concerned that arrangements have not yet been finalised as
to where the money will be found to meet the firm deadline set by Justice
Moseneke,” added Bloom. Bloom said it appears that
Makhura is trying to get the National Treasury to assist in paying the rising
costs of the Esidimeni tragedy.
