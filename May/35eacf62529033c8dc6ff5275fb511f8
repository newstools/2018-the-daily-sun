THE EFF’s Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has gone back to school, not to learn, but to motivate pupils. Fourteen years after leaving Khutlo Tharo Secondary School in zone 3, Sebokeng, the party’s national spokesman presented a motivational talk to pupils there. Ndlozi was welcomed by singing and dancing pupils as he drove into the school. Pupils at the school, as well as from Jordan, Mopholosi and Tshepo-Themba secondary schools were fascinated by the public figure who grew up in their kasi. Ndlozi shared his story of his time at school. “I was meant to exit school in 2003 but repeated a grade. “I wasn’t always on the path to success. To be honest, people who make it in life are not those who are born into success,” he said. Ndlozi told pupils they should turn studying into a fashion. “Not that we didn’t play but we collected ourselves and started working hard because we knew there was more to the future than adopting the violent lifestyles of those we looked up to,” he said. Jordan Secondary pupil Lerato Mofokeng told Daily Sun it was a great idea to motivate pupils. “We always hear those who make it are from Soweto. Today, we were motivated by one from the Vaal.”
