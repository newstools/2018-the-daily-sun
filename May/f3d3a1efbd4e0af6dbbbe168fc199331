COPS in Thabong near Welkom arrested an alleged serial burglar (22) after a tip-off. Residents said the man broke into their homes and stole appliances and TVs. He was bust on Thursday in Themba section. Captain Malebo Khosana said the arrest followed a break-in over the previous weekend. “The victim reported that he found his window and burglar bars broken,” he said. “His property including a plasma TV, sound system, microwave oven, toaster, iron and clothes, all valued at about R12 000, were stolen.” Khosana said Warrant Officer Mohapi Mokhoke and Sergeant Teboho Tsiu followed up on information, which led to the arrest. “They recovered items, with the exception of the clothes and sound system. “Our investigation raised suspicions that there is another suspect involved and his arrest could lead to the recovery of other items.” The suspect will appear in the Welkom Magistrates Court soon on charges of housebreaking and theft.
