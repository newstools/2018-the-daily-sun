RESIDENTS are living in fear of kidnappers who snatch their kids. According to the people of Etwatwa in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, kids are pulled into cars by kidnappers, who then demand R2 000 from their parents. John Makhonjwa said his son was taken last week, dumped in Tshwane, and retrieved after cops got involved. “We set up an appointment. We told them they weren’t getting anything,” he said. John told the SunTeam one of the kidnappers said he was a cop and demanded money. “I suspect it was a bogus cop,” he said. Parent Magdeline Zwane said the children tell them the thugs drive Quantums. “The kids are blindfolded,” she said. Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe confirmed that two parents had been reunited with their children after they were kidnapped. “Their children were found dumped in Mabopane,” he said. He said the kidnappers are very evasive and vigilant.
