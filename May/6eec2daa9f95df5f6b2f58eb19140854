TRAIN commuters are gatvol of getting to work late because of power cuts caused by cable theft. On Friday, they took out their anger on an alleged cable thief bust on the platform at Northmead Train Station in Benoni, Ekurhuleni. The furious commuters told the SunTeam they attacked the man because they were tired of interrupted train schedules that made them late for work and school. At the time of the incident, trains running between Daveyton and Dunswart were already more than an hour behind schedule. The suspect was allegedly found with stolen cables worth about R15 000. He was saved by cops, who took him to Tambo Memorial Hospital and put him under police watch. Goodman Matampi of Metrorail pleaded with commuters not to take the law into their own hands. He urged residents to report all suspicious activities to their nearest police station or Metrorailâ€™s protection services department. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela confirmed that a case of theft was opened and said the matter was being investigated.
