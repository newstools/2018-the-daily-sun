COPS have  in
separate incidents over this weekend arrested seven suspects in the North West
and Limpopo provinces for possession of explosive devices,  conspiracy to commit an offense and prevented
potential Automated Teller Machine (ATM) robberies. Members of the SAPS, acting on intelligence conducted
operations in both provinces. In the first incident, members went to Seraleng Village
in Brits, where they arrested three suspects aged between 27 and 29 for
possession of over 20 explosive devices. The Team went to another village called Lekgaleng to
search for a black BMW with three occupants implicated in the planning of ATM
bombing at a local business centre. The vehicle was spotted and stopped. The police seized the vehicle with potentially
incriminating items. The three suspects were arrested for conspiracy to commit
robbery and ATM bombing. In a separate incident, a woman aged 36, was arrested by
the police in Beit Bridge port of entry. When the police conducted routine
searches at the border gate, they discovered several components of explosive
devices including connector caps, emulsion explosives and blasting caps. The National Commissioner of Police, General Khehla John
Sitole, has since his appointment pronounced as part of his turnaround strategy
that there will be decisive actions implemented in an effort to stamp the
authority of the State. One of the ways of achieving this is to ensure an
effective and efficient Crime Intelligence environment coupled with a dynamic
Organised Crime Threat Analysis (OCTA) Strategy. “I am satisfied, that since the appointment of a
permanent head of crime intelligence, for the first time in seven years, that
crime intelligence is moving in a positive direction and proving to be an
enabling entity”, said General Sitole. The suspects are expected to appear in court soon on
charges of illegal possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a crime.
