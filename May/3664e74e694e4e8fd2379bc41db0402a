Rapper and Idols presenter Proverb, real name Tebogo Thekisho, is spending some quality time with his beauty queen girlfriend Liesl Laurie in Mozambique. Ever since they found each other at a street corner two years ago, the couple have been smitten with one another. Their public display of affection has seen their relationship become the envy of many. The celeb couple took to social media to share some of the beautiful pictures of themselves basking in the beautiful Mozambican sun and dining in style. “When your starters looks like a cocktail and the mains is fast approaching,” Proverb smoothly captioned one picture.
