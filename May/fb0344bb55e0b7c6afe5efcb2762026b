ALL Bonginkosi Cira wanted was to put food on the table for his six kids and wife. The 45-year-old from Mfuleni outside Cape Town, sells cow head stew in busy Parliament Street. Bonginkosi told Daily Sun he started off selling amathumbu (intestines) with his wife in 2014. “I decided to take the business to the next level and started to sell cow head stew,” said Bonginkosi. He used to work for a scrap company and when he lost his job, he knew that he had to find a way to make ends meets. “My wife has been in this business for a long time. I never bothered to look for a formal job. “She was her own boss. I then realised that as the head of the family I had to raise my hand and oversee things,” said Bonginkosi. “This business helps me feed my family. We send our kids to school. “I also make sure that all their school needs, food and everything is provided for them,” he said. However, the business comes with its own challenges. “Business is unpredictable. We have bad and better days. “The trick is to take it one day at a time,” he said. “In 2014, we used to make R80 a day but the price has risen to R120 for a head,” he said. Bonginkosi charges R30 or each plate of food. “I have loyal customers from 2014 and I make sure that they get the best service.”
