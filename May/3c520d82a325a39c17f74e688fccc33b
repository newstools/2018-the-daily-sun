THE National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has told
first year students, who qualify to get a bursary from the NSFAS, to sign their agreements by 31 July 2018. NSFAS recently will be implementing the new National Student
Financial Aid Scheme Bursary Agreement (NBA) after government announced fee-free
education. The NBA is only accessible to first-year students and senior
students who applied to NSFAS for the first time in 2018. According to NSFAS student in all universities and colleges will
be notified in due course by e-mail. "The email notification contains a link, which students
must click and it takes them to an online version of the NBA, which they have
to sign by the deadline. Each student will receive the email directly,"
NSFAS said in a statement. "NSFAS is concerned that the process is moving slowly.
By 15 May, we had generated 37 893 NBAs, but only 5 063 had been signed,‚Äù the
scheme said in a statement." Affected students who fail to sign the NBA by 31 July 2018
will not have their bursaries paid. The statement further said if the online signing option is
not functioning optimally, NSFAS will make a manual NBA available for onsite
physical signing.
