NO win, no lose, two points. Mamelodi Sundowns can rest easy as they go into a needed off-season break, knowing their Caf Champions League campaign remains well on track. Yes, they could be sitting comfortably in second spot in group C, equal on four points with leaders Wydad Casablanca. But unbeaten away against Horoya AC on Tuesday, the Brazilians retained complete control of their destination in the tricky group stages. Pitso Mosimane’s boys won’t be in Caf action, at least until 17 July, when they visit Togo Port of Togo. They will host the same Togo side in a return match a week later, before they travel to Morocco for their return fixture against Wydad Casablanca on 17 August. Their last match is against Horoya in September, the Guinea side that shook them from their comfort zone with a gutsy display. The Brazilians looked to have found a possible winner when Gaston Sirino added to Khama Billiat’s goal. But Horoya snatched a crucial 2-2 draw. “They scored first and we equalised, and then we went ahead and they came back, so it was fair,” said Mosimane. “I said we would try to win and we did try to win. But they equalised. I also said that if we don’t win then we should at least not lose. But in the second half we played the way we usually play, and we could find each other with our passing, and that is the way Sundowns plays. “They scored two goals, we scored two goals.” Horoya beat Togo Porto in their opening match and they appear to be the underdog in the group. “They are a very good team, as I’ve said, and you saw what happened in the match,” Mosimane added. “I thought it was a game of two halves. We woke up very late, we were asleep and we couldn’t play our normal football in the first half.” But based on their ability to adapt to tough conditions and experience, Sundowns are unlikely to hit a snag in the group.
