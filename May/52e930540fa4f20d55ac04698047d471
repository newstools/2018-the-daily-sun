AFTER struggling to find a job, Moses Tsoeunyane didn’t waste any time. The 22-year-old from Clocolan, Free State, opened a juice and sweet stall with his savings and a loan from his sister. After matriculating in 2015, no one could help pay for his studies, so he decided to become his own boss. “Life was very hard because I struggled to finish school,” he said. “But I didn’t lose hope. I kept my head up and thought long and hard about what I wanted to do with my life.” Moses had initially wanted to study design and technology. “I told my sister I wanted to go into business to come up with tuition fees.” She lent him money and he bought dried fruit and juice. “I thought of selling in the CBD next to the shopping complex and built myself a small canteen with boxes,” he said. Business started off very slowly but picked up eventually. “My customers were mostly pupils, but parents became regulars as my prices are reasonable,” said Moses. He said struggling people shouldn’t lose hope but push hard to live their dreams. That’s why he saves the money he makes. “I thanked my sister and promised her I’d make her proud one day,” he told Daily Sun. He wants to own a juice making factory one day.
