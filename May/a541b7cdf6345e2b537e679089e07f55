Mzansi RnB and House singer Bucie, real name Bisisiwe Nolubabalo Nqwiliso, is one of the most recognisable female House vocalists in the country but she has revealed that her life would be much simpler if she didn’t have the fame. Speaking on Power FM in a recent interview, the 31 year old told Mpumi Mlambo that she finds fame “exhausting.” “I want nothing to do with fame,” she told the station. “I just want to sing and not have anyone knowing the face behind the voice. “Fame is so exhausting, I’m one of the realest people and fame does not allow you to be real, fame and people expect you to be a certain way, you need to be something that they are comfortable with in order to be famous and that is exhausting,” she said. The 31 year-old took a break from the spotlight a while back and that must have brought her much needed relief from the "misery" that comes with fame.
