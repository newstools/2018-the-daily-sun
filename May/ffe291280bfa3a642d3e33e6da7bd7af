A GOGO and her great-grandson were burnt to death in the early hours of Friday morning. Mookho said gogo chased her away after she arrived home late when the child was still breastfeeding. “If I was at home I could have died with my gogo and son,” she said. “I am deeply hurt because I lost my family at the same time.” She said she had been living with her son’s dad since her gogo made her leave. “I don’t have the money for a burial because I am unemployed.” Neighbour Morongoe Nomganga (31) said gogo Belinah had been looking for Mookho before the tragic incident. “She wanted her granddaughter to come back home. “I think gogo saw that death was coming.” Councillor Johannes Majara said they would assist Mookho to rebuild the shack. “We will also help the family with the burial. What happened is very sad and I extend my condolences to the family and friends,” said Majara. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi confirmed the incident. She said: “The two victims were burnt to ashes. A paraffin heater was found next to their bed. “Kagisanong cops have opened an inquest docket.”
