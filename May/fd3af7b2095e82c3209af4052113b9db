AN AREA of the ocean famous for vicious winds and massive
swells this week threw up a record-breaking wave. According to New
Zealand Herald, a buoy used to measure the size of waves in the Southern
Ocean – also known as the Antarctic Ocean – on Tuesday night registered a wave
a massive 25 metres high. This is about the same height as an eight-storey
building. The previous record in the area was a wave 19,4 metres
high, recorded in May last year. This footage is of a patrol vessel fighting through a
storm in the Southern Ocean in 2015, with waves about 20 metres high.
