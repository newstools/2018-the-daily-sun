A defeat for Ajax on the day means they will finish in position 15 and that will confirm the will be part of the play-offs, but a victory for them will mean they will have to depend on other results. Ertugral is confident his troops will get the result against his former club Amakhosi. “We are going to win‚ I really believe that in my heart‚” Ertugral told the club website. “The confidence is there. We just need to put the ball in the back of the net! It’s simple, we win – we stay up! “We worked on our strengths this week and went into detail – analyzing Kaizer Chiefs in depth. At home, it is interesting to see that we have the second best record this season. He added: “Kaizer Chiefs are coming here to play, coming here to win. But, I am confident that we will win on Saturday, we have to win. Everyone wants to play. Everyone wants to be on the field.”
