DIVERS have discovered a plastic bag at the bottom of the
deepest part of the ocean, almost 11 kms under the waves. The horrific fact came to light recently thanks to
scientists analysing 30 years of data from dives into different areas of the oceans
to document the spread of human waste. The Mariana Trench is the deepest part of the world's
oceans, almost 11 kms under the surface of the water. It is in the western part
of the Pacific, not far from the Philippines. According to The
Daily Mail, the plastic bag is just one of 3 000 pieces of man-made junk
identified in Earth’s oceans. About a third of this rubbish is made of plastic, mostly
from products designed to be thrown away after one use, such as plastic bags,
straws, coffee stirrers, water bottles and most food packaging. This is just more evidence to back up the belief that our
oceans are in danger of being strangled to death by human rubbish, especially
plastic. Plastic is made
out of petrol and doesn’t decay to natural substances. It does eventually break
down into tiny pieces, which are then consumed by ocean dwelling life like
fish. FRIGHTENING FACTS:
PLASTIC IN OUR OCEANS - Over the last ten years we have produced more plastic
than during the whole of the last century. - More than 8 million tons of plastic is dumped into our
oceans every year. - Cigarette butts, plastic bags, fishing gear, and food and
drink containers are the most common forms of plastic pollution found in the
oceans. - A plastic straw has a “working life” of about 15 minutes,
but can take as long as 200 years before it breaks up.
