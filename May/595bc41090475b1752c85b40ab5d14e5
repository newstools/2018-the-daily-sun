THE cops came looking for her son, saying he was a criminal. Gogo Zodwa Shabangu didn’t stand in their way. Today’s she’s spitting mad after police allegedly left her house in a mess, with parts of the ceiling and doors in tatters. Zodwa said if her son really is a criminal, he has to face the mighty hand of the law. But she’s furious that the men in blue ransacked her home. The gogo from Braamfischerville in Soweto was in tears when she called Daily Sun. “I was on my way out with a friend when I saw about eight men in front of my gate,” she said. “I didn’t pay attention because I thought they were my son’s friends.” Zodwa said as she stepped outside the gate, she was blocked and shown police cards. “They asked me where my son was. I told them the last time I checked he was in his backroom,” said Zodwa. “They didn’t waste time. They took a spade and started breaking doors.” She said when she asked what her son had done, she was told he and his two friends hijacked a woman at gunpoint. “The last time I experienced so much aggression was during apartheid. They went through the ceiling and searched for him. “They also went to his sisters’ rooms but couldn’t find him.” Zodwa said when she asked the police not to destroy her house because she didn’t have money for repairs, she was told her son was a criminal and police could do as they pleased. “I didn’t know that my son was capable of committing such a crime,” she said. “If only he had handed himself over to the police, I wouldn’t be in this situation. “If he gets up to shady dealings, then he must pay the price. “But the police treated me like I sent him to rob people.” Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said if Zodwa has a complaint, she should open a case of malicious damage to property and investigations will follow.
