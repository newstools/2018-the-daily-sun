THE relatives of a missing couple are convinced the bodies found by cops belong to their loved ones. The corpses, which were found in Mhlathuze River, Mpola, are believed to be those of Langelihle Mazeka (41) and Nozipho Mnguni (27). The couple went missing on 13 December. Mazeka is originally from Impendle and Mnguni is from Greytown. Langelihle’s mum, Doreen Mazeka (57), said although the police still have to do DNA tests, she is sure her son’s remains have finally been found. “The last five months have been a living hell because I didn’t know what had happened to my son. When the remains were shown to me, I recognised my son’s red T-shirt and blue pants. “I didn’t see him on the day he went missing but I know his clothes,” she said. Nozipho’s sister Londiwe Zondi (34) said she has not had an opportunity to see the bodies as she was not in Durban “But I spoke to Langelihle’s mum. “She told me Nozipho was wearing nothing but a bra,” said Londiwe. Londiwe said Langelihle always fetched her sister from work because she knocked off late and had to walk through the bush on her way home. “But in December he went to fetch her and never returned. “Then I got the call informing me that two bodies had been found.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said an inquest docket has been opened.
