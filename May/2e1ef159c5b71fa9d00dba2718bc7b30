DEMOCRATIC Alliance shadow minister of human settlements, Solly Malatsi, was shocked by the terrible living conditions at Glebelands Hostel in Umlazi, south of Durban. This follows his oversight visit on Monday, along with his deputy Mbulelo Bara, DA shadow minister of police Zakhele Mbhele, DA KZN community safety spokesman Dr Rishigen Viranna as well as other local councillors. He said: “During our oversight visit we engaged residents who shared with us their frustrations over the long wait to receive safe and dignified housing. “We found the worst imaginable living conditions at the hostel, ranging from broken windows to collapsed roofs which haven’t been fixed or replaced by the municipality for over a year,” said Malatsi. He said residents told them that they were tired of waiting on the long promised upgrade of the hostel as their safety, security and right to dignified living conditions hang in the balance. “The inaction and the silence of the ANC government speaks volumes about their contempt for the people of Glebelands,” said Malatsi. He added that their intention was also to assess the situation of the residents’ safety and security. One of the residents, Simphiwe Duma (47), said: “The roofs that were damaged by storms last year have not been repaired. “We are worried about our safety as anything can happen if they remain like this.” EThekwini mayoral spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said: “A team has been put in place to improve the living conditions in this hostel.”
