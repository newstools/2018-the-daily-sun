THE smell of dagga hung over Cape Town and parliament on Saturday. No, it wasn’t cabinet having a quick smoke break. But cops did get a good whiff during a huge protest pleading with politicians to legalise marijuana. Mzukisi Solwanje (35), from Langa kasi, told Daily Sun: “We smoke weed and we don’t hurt anyone. People who drink alcohol kill one another, yet booze isn’t prohibited.” Mzukisi was one of the hundreds of Rastafarians and dagga lovers who were part of the march. Many people smoked dagga during the march in the presence of the cops. Organiser and protest leader Johannes “Smokie Jo” Berkhout said: “We are gathering for the legalisation of cannabis in South Africa. “We are asking for fair regulation in the country. We want to see it handed over to the community that needs upliftment, not to a few at the top.” The Western Cape High Court declared last March that it was an infringement to ban the use of dagga by adults in private homes. The court ruled that parliament must change sections of the Drug Trafficking Act, as well as the Medicines Control Act within 24 months. The ruling came after the Dagga Party leader Jeremy Acton and Rastafarian Garreth Prince and 18 plaintiffs applied to the court for laws regarding dagga to be amended.
