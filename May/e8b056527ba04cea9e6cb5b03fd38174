IN December Muela Ginzanza (35) from Rosettenville, Joburg, spent her savings on expensive furniture. Whenever people visited her house, they praised her for her good taste in furniture. Sadly, it all went up in smoke yesterday. She could do nothing but watch in horror as her house and furniture were reduced to a pile of ashes. When the SunTeam went to interview her, the mother of two broke down in tears. She told the SunTeam it had cost her about R200 000 to furnish the house she has been living in for 12 years. “Now its all gone,” said Muela. She said she doesn’t know what started the fire. “I took my child to creche and when I returned the house was on fire. “None of my appliances was plugged in, as I prepared the lunch boxes and ironed the previous night. “All was well when I left, which is why I was shocked to see my house on fire when I got back,” she said. Muela’s neighbours said they understood why she was crying uncontrollably Didine Lutayi, another resident, said: “She had the best furniture. Whatever started that fire has messed up her life.” Muela said she lost everything, including important documents. “My kids will come back from school to find that they no longer have a home.”
