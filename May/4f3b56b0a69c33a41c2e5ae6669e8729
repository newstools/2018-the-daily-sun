Gqom musician and WestInk boss, Mampintsha will reportedly be on Metro FM tomorrow afternoon. Word has it that he will be on the very same show that exposed him for being an alleged woman-basher. According to Mo Flava, Mampintsha will be on The Drive tomorrow afternoon. “He’ll be on my show on Monday, not sure what he’d like to say, but we’ll see,” said Mo. Mampintsha will join Masechaba Ndlovu and Mo Flava on the show to give his side of the story and answer to allegations that claim that he abused and broke his now ex-fiancé’s leg. One cannot help but wonder how the energy will be between him and Masechaba given how she vehemently pushed for this story to be exposed live on air. We also wonder whether he will actually give an honest account of what has transpired between him and Babes as well as clear up some rumours like whether or not she was ever pregnant. Fans are also looking forward to finding out if Babes has pressed charges against him and if they will continue to work together.
