Seasoned actor Luzuko Nteleko is the latest victim of crime. The lanky actor was shocked when he discovered thugs had broken into his car while he was mourning the death of his long-time friend, Akhumzi Jezile, at Rhema Church in Randburg, north of Jozi. The 33-year-old thought his eyes were playing tricks on him as he saw the windscreen of his car scattered on the ground after the memorial service, which was held on Thursday. He opened a case of theft and malicious damage to property at the Honeydew Police Station on the same day. Police spokesperson Balan Muthan said officers were still investigating the case and no one had been arrested. According to a statement by the actor, who is popularly known as the face of Absa’s banking app, the tsotsis also stole his belongings estimated to be worth R25 000. “At about 7pm, the complainant parked his silver Renault Clio with (regis-tration withheld) at the parking lot of Rhema Church. “When retur-ning, he found his rear right window broken and lying on the ground. Upon inspection, he discovered that his Adidas bag with tracksuits, soccer boots and clothes was stolen and the value of the stolen items is R25 000,” reads his statement. When contacted for comment, Luzuko said he was disappointed such an incident could take place at a church. “I don’t want to focus on that. I just want to focus on paying my last respects to my dearest friend. It’s just the devil trying to destruct us from honouring Akhumzi,” he said. He told the SunTeam he saw about eight cars which were broken into on the night. Sunday Sun reliably learnt that a total of nine similar cases were reported at the Honeydew cop shop on the night.
