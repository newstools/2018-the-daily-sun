THE Thokwane family is asking SunReaders for help. The family of five from Hebron, north of Tshwane, were almost left homeless when their home caught fire last October. Six months later, they’re struggling to rebuild their lives, having lost everything. The blaze destroyed five rooms and their belongings, leaving the family with only a bathroom and main bedroom. The family told Daily Sun life hasn’t been easy. The man of the house, Nicolas Thokwane (49), said all his tools were destroyed in the fire, which made it difficult for him to find piece jobs. “I used to build houses and do some painting in my area and that helped me make some money, but ever since the house burned down with my tools in it, it’s been hard,” he said. Nicolas said he tried to find piece jobs, hoping to make money, but it was still not enough. He said what frustrated him more was the fact that they had to share their bedroom with their kids and they don’t have any privacy. His wife Marry (47) said her family has been in and out of the clinic because of the cold. “My kids sleep on the floor and we don’t have enough blankets. When it gets cold they get sick. She said they have been living hand-outs from neighbours but when their luck didn’t change, people got tired of helping them. “We’d appreciate any help, even if someone donates building tools for my husband and warm clothes for my children. “That would go a long way,” she said.
