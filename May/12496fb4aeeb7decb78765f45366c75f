POLICE officers were yesterday called to restore order at a school in J section of KwaMashu, north of Durban. Matric pupils from Mzuvele High School went on the rampage. They demanded that a matric pupil accused of stealing a cellphone be suspended. A pupil (17) said the accused was caught red-handed. “When he was asked to bring back the cellphone he denied taking it, even though another pupil saw him steal it. “Some pupils punched him and the cellphone flew out of his pocket. “He went to Nqabakazulu High School and fetched three of his friends, who came to moer those who beat him up,” said the pupil. “But the accused’s friends were stabbed and had to be rushed to hospital.” When the SunTeam arrived at the school, cops were having a meeting with pupils and the principal. Provincial education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said the school should enforce its code of conduct so that such incidents did not happen again. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the stabbing. “A case of assault was opened at KwaMashu Police Station,” said Gwala.
