POLICE Minister Bheki Cele has vowed to deal with security companies involved in taxi violence in KZN. Sixteen men employed by a known security company were arrested on Friday following a shooting at Brook Street Taxi Rank in Durban which left one person dead and two seriously wounded. Mkhali Madondo (56), a chairman of the Ixopo Taxi Association, was killed. His younger brother Thulani (43) and their friend Khanya Dlamini (46) were taken to hospital. Mkhali and Thulani’s brother Vimbela (51) said the family was very upset as it was clear his brother had been targeted. After the shooting, the suspects escaped in a Quantum taxi and raced towards Pinetown, where they were cornered by cops. They were arrested after a shoot-out. Visiting the taxi rank on Saturday, Cele said security companies making extra money through taxi violence would be prosecuted. He was accompanied by safety and transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda, who said he would meet with the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority to discuss the matter. Cele said: “We are concerned that in most incidents you find security companies involved. “We are organising a summit with these companies and taxi associations. If it is found they are not following the law, we will deal with them harshly.” Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the suspects were found in possession of nine rifles, a shotgun and seven pistols. They were charged with murder, attempted murder and illegal possession of firearms. Mbhele said they would appear in the Durban Magistrates Court today. Bob Shabalala, a chairman of the Ixopo association, said Mkhali wanted to stop paying the security company to guard their route as it had become peaceful.
