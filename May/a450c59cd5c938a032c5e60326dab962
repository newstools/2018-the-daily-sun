TWO cousins who were the best of friends were killed in a car crash on Tuesday. Thabiso and Mlungisi Maphumulo died on the spot after they were hit by a car while riding on a motorbike in Mashiwase Village in Illovo, south of Durban. Thabiso (21) was a grade 11 pupil at Robert Hlongwa High, while Mlungisi (18) completed high school last year. Thabiso’s father, Justice Maphumulo (47) said Mlungisi had just picked up his son from school and they were on their way home when the accident happened. “My heart is bleeding. I don’t even know what to say because I just can’t think straight right now,” said Justice. A resident, Ntokozo Cele (43), said the accident scene was the most horrible thing she had ever seen. “Both the young men’s lifeless bodies were lying on the road. “Tears rolled down my cheeks because I knew how close they had been.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the accident. “A case of culpable homicide was opened at Amanzimtoti Police Station after a motorbike and car collided. Circumstances surrounding the accident are still being investigated by the cops,” she said.
