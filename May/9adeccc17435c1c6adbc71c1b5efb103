RESIDENTS of Nkandla, northern KZN, braved Saturday’s cold weather to attend the Nkandla May rural racing event. Jockeys from different villages in the area were eager to compete. Jockey Siyabonga Mabaso (24) walked away with R15 000 after winning the main race. “Even though it wasn’t the first time I competed at the Nkandla May Race, I was a bit nervous because anything is possible,” he said. “When my horse Album took first place, I was excited.” Siyabonga said he started riding horses at the age of nine. “I have competed in races like the Dundee July Race and have 35 titles to my name. “One day I hope to be part of the Durban July, South Africa’s biggest horse racing event.” A horse called Minister took second place, while Inxakanxaka came in third. The Miss Nkandla beauty pageant was held on Friday and a music concert took place after the race. Igcokama Elisha, Khuzani and DJs Bongz and Merlon were some of the artists in the line-up. Nkandla mayor Thami Ngubane said the event has grown over the past four years. Ngubane said: “The event is not just about entertainment. It also boosts our economy because visitors buy from vendors. “Local transport and accommodation businesses also make a lot of money.”
