MAGOSHAS are angry with men who have been cutting the long grass near the highway. According to magoshas who work near the highway in Caleb Motshabi kasi, Free State, the men are destroying their poking spots. But grass cutter Thato Radikhomo (27) said the magoshas should find a proper spot to do their business. “The problem started when we were cutting grass for roofing. “One of the women started yelling at us to stop because this was their spot,” he said. “We only come here to collect grass so we can make thatch roofs for our customers. This is the only way to feed our families. “They don’t own this place and we are not stopping them from selling their bodies. They should build themselves a hut so they can have a proper place to take their clients.” One of the magoshas told the SunTeam they had been using the spot for years, and the men were ruining their business. “How will we feed our families? Most of our clients don’t have cars and this is the only place they feel comfortable. This is our poking spot,” she said. Resident Thato Mosikari said: “Ever since I moved to this area, magoshas have been using these spots. I’m glad these men came to cut down the grass. We’re tired of magoshas corrupting our kids with their bad behaviour.”
