PEOPLE living with disability filled the busy streets of Mthatha when they marched to King Sabatha Dalindyebo Municipality yesterday. They went there to hand over a petition of grievances. They wanted taxis to be brought back after most ranks were closed by Police Minister Bheki Cele last month. The ranks were closed as a result of the taxi violence that has claimed more than 60 lives since 2016. The marchers said they didn’t want to use the Jubilee Taxi Rank. One of the marchers, Nonkululeko Buzwayo, said she was mugged while on her way to the crowded Jubilee. “That place is not good for us. It’s far and our wheelchairs are not accommodated. People using crushes are not safe there. “I was robbed on 2 May and the thugs took my groceries and money. We are not asking for our own rank, but we want to be at same rank with normal people,” she said. Mlungiseleli Mbhem from Port St Johns uses crutches. He said he often walks to Waterfall township, which is more than 10km away. “I decided to be part of the march because we need assistance. This is painful for us. “We are not safe at that rank, especially people who use wheelchairs.” Zilindile Hibhana, chairman of the Disabled People Association in OR Tambo, said the region has more than 5000 people living with disabilities. “Our people are sometimes forced to sleep in town because of the taxi struggle.” Councillor Edgar Maphekula accepted the petition on behalf of mayor Dumani Zozo. “It’s clear what needs to be done,” he said. He said he’d present the petition to the mayor, and that they’d respond within seven days.
