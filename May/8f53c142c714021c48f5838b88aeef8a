A VOICE clip of a woman Metro cop pleading for help has been leaked. The officer with the Ekurhuleni Metro Police apparently recorded herself after she was allegedly locked in an office at the Metro police offices in Thokoza on Saturday. In the clip, which has gone viral, the woman can be heard crying and saying: “I’m locked in an office by my supervisor who brutally assaulted me. “This guy is swearing at me. If I wake up dead tomorrow, just know he did it. “I tried to report him to the unions but nothing was done. “ I can’t even open the door as I’m locked in. If anyone can help, please help. I’m in Thokoza EMPD, please help.” The woman later told the police she had been assaulted by her senior supervisor at work. He was suspended on Wednesday. Ekurhuleni Metro Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said the department acted swiftly after the allegations came to light. He said the woman registered a case of assault and the Metro police chief suspended the supervisor for three months. “The alleged perpetrator of the assault may not report for duty until investigations in the matter are completed,” he said. “The city condemns any form of abuse against women and other vulnerable members of society. This matter is no different and we will do a thorough investigation.”
