A FAMILY from Amatikwe, north of Durban, is living in fear. The family of six said it’s only a matter of time before the power line above their house causes a tragedy. Nonhlanhla Mhlongo (29) said the power line has been hanging over their corrugated iron roof since 2016. “It was a rainy and windy night when I heard something hitting our roof. I thought it was a tree. In the morning I went to check and discovered it was a power line.” Nonhlanhla went to tell her neighbours about her discovery. “We realised that the storm had bent an electricity pole, which caused the power line to hang lower than it usually did.” She said she reported the matter to Ethekwini Municipality, but they just kept giving her reference numbers. “A neighbour told my brother to put wood between the line and the roof. “We fear the line will start a fire that will burn us all while we are inside the house. “This power line is like a ticking time bomb. We want it removed. Anything could happen. This is very dangerous.” Municipal spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said: “Electricians were sent out to see if the family is safe. “They will continue to do so until the department addresses the issue.”
