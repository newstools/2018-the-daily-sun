COPS have been told to guard the Precast Cemetery in Lenasia after a family discovered their relative’s grave had been dug up. Neither cops nor City Parks could find out who dug the trench and why. Reggie Moloi of City Parks told Daily Sun on Wednesday the City was still trying to find out who owns the land. “If the land is owned by private people, they’re responsible for taking care of the graves. “The owner of the land should provide alternatives for the graves and work with families who buried their relatives there.” Moloi said if the place is public, City Parks will provide a solution. “If the graves are older than 60 years, the National Heritage Council will have to secure the site,” he said. City Parks spokeswoman Jenny Moodley said there was a similar case in Cosmo City, north of Joburg, and they were working with cops to find a solution. Community leader Dan Nkgadima (58) accused the municipality of ignoring calls fence the site. “I’ve been trying to get hold of the City since 1995,” he said. Kleinboy family spokesman Jacob Mothole (70) said: “We need the cops to find out who dug up the grave and arrest that person. Captain Hector Netshivhodza said there will be cops at the cemetery until forensic investigators are finished with their work.
