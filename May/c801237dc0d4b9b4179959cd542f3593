FREE State thugs have found an easy way to make a quick buck. They sell fake gold bars to unsuspecting buyers on the streets of Odendaalsrus. Cops have warned people not to fall for the scam. Captain Stephen Thakeng said a fake gold bar was found recently. “They look exactly like gold but are fake.” He said one of the fake bars was found on Tuesday, after the victim phoned police and asked for help. “The victim and suspect met at a garage in the Odendaalsrus CBD. “The deal was wrapped up, but before the money was handed over to the suspect the complainant saw something wasn’t quite right. “He decided not to hand over the money but rather to phone the police,” said Thakeng. He said police gave chase, but by the time they caught the suspect he had already thrown it away. “The bar was found but not in his possession.” Thakeng said they believe suspects sell fake gold bars and, after they get their money, others who’re part of their group drive behind the buyer. “They then bump the buyer’s car from behind. “When he stops, the thugs rob him of the same bar before he discovers it’s fake. “They then go and sell it to someone else,” said Thakeng.
