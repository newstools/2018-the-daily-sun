Groblersdal cops have arrested serial rapist who has
been terrorising women around Rakgoadi, Nebo and Sonnoville areas between 2014 and 2017. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the
35-year old taxi owner, targeted victims aged between 14 and 23 by offering them
lifts at night using a taxi or private vehicles. Ngoepe said  while
driving to their destination, he would deviate and drive them to secluded areas
where he then rapes them. In some instances, the ordeal would take place inside the
vehicle. He said this suspect was unknown because he was faceless
to his victims and thought he had perfectly covered his tracks. He was once arrested in 2017 in Shoshanguve township near
Pretoria in the Gauteng Province for burglary but was later released. Ngoepe said the intensive investigations by the FCS have
linked him to six cases of rape cases in Limpopo Province and subsequently, he
was  traced and arrested in Alexandra
township in the Gauteng Province by the Saps Limpopo Joint Task Team. The suspect will appear before the Nebo Magistrate Court
on Monday. The Saps Provincial Commissioner in Limpopo General Nneke
Ledwaba has commended the excellent and team effort  by the Groblersdal FCS and the Crime
Intelligence unit for successfully cracking this criminal. He said it is a clear cautioning message to all the
criminals out there, especially those who target vulnerable citizens that they
can run but they will never hide from the long arm of the law. The South African Police Service is still making an appeal
to anyone who might became a victim of this suspect ,to contact Detective
Warrant Officer Malacia Moela at 071 355 0577 or the crime stop number 08600
10111 or the crime line sms 32211 or the nearest Police Station.
