A MASSIVE shake-up can be expected from the top to the bottom of the National First Division (NFD) standings as the curtain comes down on the championship on Sunday. At the top, Black Leopards, Real Kings or Witbank Spurs will complete the list of three teams taking part in the NFD national/promotion play-offs later this month. Leopards will qualify if they beat Jomo Cosmos. Chasing that last spot, Spurs and Kings also have to beat their respective opponents and hope Lidoda Duvha lose. Kings are currently ahead of Spurs on goal difference. Both have 45 points. Kings meet CT All Stars in their last match, while Spurs face Royal Eagles. Cosmos have accumulated enough points to qualify for the play-offs. Kings goalkeeper Ricardo Goss says they hope Cosmos will do them a huge favour by defeating Leopards. Said Goss said: “There is no pressure at all, we cannot control the situation we are in right now. The only thing we can do is win our game against All Stars and wait for other results.” In the bottom half of the table the situation is tricky for four teams, Ubuntu Cape Town, Richards Bay FC, Uthongathi FC and Super Eagles. One of them will be relegated to the ABC Motsepe League to follow Mthatha Bucks who have already been relegated.
