Shortly after allegedly shooting a woman, a 23-year-old KwaZulu-Natal man took to Facebook to apparently confess to the crime. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said in the early hours of Wednesday, the police were called to a Mangosuthu University of Technology residence called Lonsdale in South Beach, Durban. "When police arrived, they found a 21-year-old with multiple gunshots," said Zwane. The 21-year-old has been identified as quantity surveying student Zolile Khumalo, who is believed to be the ex-girlfriend of the suspect. Zwane said a 23-year-old male, who was found at the scene, surrendered to the police. "An unlicensed firearm was recovered at the scene as well as ammunition." 'I killed my Zozo' The man is expected to appear at the Durban Magistrate's Court on Thursday or Friday on charges of murder, and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. The incident at this stage is suspected to have been part of a domestic dispute, said Zwane. In a Facebook post, the man wrote in isiZulu: "Konke kwaphenduka umlando ukube benginamandla bengzomvusa silungise amaphutha ngomlomo ...kodwa mnj kuphi laa ngba usehambe wangshiya ngingasashongo ukt ngyamxolela (sic)." Loosely translated, he said: "It is surreal. If I had the power I would bring her back so that we can right our wrongs by talking. But that's no longer possible because she has left me without me having told her that I forgive her." When one of the man's Facebook friends asked him what had happened, he wrote: "Ndoda ngombulele uMy zozo (sic)" ("Man, I killed my Zozo".) It is suspected that he wrote the post shortly after allegedly committing the crime. SOURCE: NEWS24
