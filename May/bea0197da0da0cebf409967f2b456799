A WAR is brewing between taxi men and school transport drivers over the transportation of children. It is alleged members of the Benoni Taxi Association in Ekurhuleni have demanded that older pupils use taxis to school because they are losing income. But the Benoni Education Transport Operation has said this will not happen. Bongani Masemola of Beto said: “We started transporting these kids while they were still young. “They grew up in our vehicles and there’s nothing wrong with that.” Last Thursday furious school transport operators marched to the police station in Benoni to ask cops to intervene in the stand-off. They accused the taxi drivers of being greedy and claimed they were even bullying older pupils to get out of school transport vehicles. Parent Seun Manzi said he was used to paying R600 a month for transport, but if the taxi drivers get their way he will have to pay R300 more. “My son will have to pay for a local taxi and one to Benoni where he goes to school.” Sara Sithole, another angry parent, said: “We pay school operators monthly. Taxi drivers want us to pay daily.” She said they prefer school transport because the children are safe and will come home on time to study. “We do not understand why taxi drivers are so greedy. They wouldn’t impound a private car when colleagues give each other lifts to work.” Parents said if the issue was not resolved they would march in solidarity with the school transport operators. Benoni Taxi Association spokesman Dumisani Ntuli said he was not aware of the matter but would organise a meeting to resolve it peacefully. The police’s Captain Nomsa Sekele said the memorandum was handed over to one of their officials.
