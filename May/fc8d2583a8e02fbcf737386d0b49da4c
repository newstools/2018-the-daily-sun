DON’T litter in canals or drains – it causes flooding! This is the urgent appeal by the City of Cape Town to the Strand community after angry Wag-’n-Bietjie squatter camp residents in Lwandle barricaded the entrance to the area with burning objects on May Day. Residents complained that they were tired of living in flooded houses after the heavy rains on 26 April. The City of Cape Town recently released a list of flooding hot spos and all the squatter camps in Strand were excluded from the list. Mother of four Siyolise Sifili said she was tired of living in waterlogged shacks. “Our electrical appliances and furniture have been damaged. We tried talking to the ward councillor, but he only made promises. We are tired of talk,” she said. Residents also blame the nearby channel and stormwater drainage system, which they say fails to drain adequately. They claim it directs storm water into their houses. The City cleared the canal on Friday. Mayoral committee member Councillor Anda Ntsodo said they found materials that didn’t belong there. “Rubbish and other dumped material blocks stormwater drains and canals. The blockages prevent water from draining away and results in flooding of roads and neighbourhoods. “The public is urged to dispose of their refuse appropriately and not to dump it in the canals, sewer and stormwater systems, as this results in flooding of roads and houses.”
