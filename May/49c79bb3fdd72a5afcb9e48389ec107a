TWO years ago residents saved eight tortoises and a vervet monkey from a cruel existence with sangoma Pauline Tukula (64). And on Thursday, she was ordered to pay a big fine or go to jail if she did it again. Bloemfontein SPCA spokeswoman senior inspector Reinet Meyer said the sangoma from Bochabela in Mangaung appeared before the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court and was sentenced on Thursday. “Tukula admitted to not having permits to keep wild animals,” Meyer told Daily Sun. She said the monkey was in a wire cage and there was no food or water available for the animal. The cage was hopelessly too small, with loose wires that could hurt the monkey. There was no food or water for the tortoises. “The monkey and tortoises were taken to a vet. They were malnourished and dehydrated,” said Meyer. Pauline and her husband Tshidiso were charged for not having permits to keep the wild animals and convicted. The sangoma was sentenced to a fine of R6 000 or six months in jail, suspended for five years. Tshidiso was sentenced to a fine of R6 000 or six months imprisonment, of which R4 000 or four months imprisonment was suspended for five years. “Although she is a sangoma, the SPCA will not tolerate animal abuse,” said Meyer.
