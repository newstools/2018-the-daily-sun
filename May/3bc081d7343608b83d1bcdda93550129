CRECHE owners in Khayelitsha, Cape Town were over the moon when Councillor Anele Gabuza gave them blankets and furniture on Friday. Gabuza donated I04 chairs, 65 mattresses, 26 tables and 65 fleece blankets to 13 creches. Khayelitsha Early Childhood Development Forum chairwoman Boniswa Mxakaza said it would go a long way to improving the children’s lives. “No kid will sleep on the floor as we have received what we desperately needed.” She said many kasi creches didn’t have the resources they needed as owners had no money. Harare Educare principal Bongiwe Masilane said: “We are very happy the councillor and his ward committee came to our rescue. We struggle for support.” Mxakaza said it was difficult to register a creche if you don’t meet the standards required by Cape Town’s social development department, health inspectors and fire safety inspectors. “It has been a struggle to register, because municipal inspectors expect everything to be up to standard. “Sometimes creche owners can’t afford it but the councillor’s helping hand has made it easier to register and when inspectors come, they will see our creches in order.” Gabuza said his ward committee looks at places that need improvement and then approaches the municipality for funding. He said they used the ward allocation fund for the donation.
