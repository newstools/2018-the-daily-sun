NTOMBOXOLO Swelindawo from Centane outside Butterworth in the Eastern Cape is leading by example. The 48-year-old sews dresses and makes women’s clothing and school uniforms and traditional attire. She started the business in 2009 after she lost her husband. Ntomboxolo appealed to government and the Mnquma Local Municipality to do more to empower women. She told Daily Sun: “I worked at different companies in East London for seven years. “I then decided to start my own business as a seamstress.” Ntomboxolo said she heeded the call from government to make a living for herself. “It was not easy to start this business because I had nothing. “I joined a local stokvel so that I could afford to buy my sewing machines.” Ntomboxolo’s determination paid off. “I have established strong relations with local schools and churches. “On a good month I make more than R4 000.” She said she will register her business soon.
