FORMER deputy High Education Minister Mduduzi Manana is facing
fresh allegations of assault. It's reported that this time it is from his former domestic
worker. Douglasdale cops confirmed that a case of common assault has
been opened, but they declined to confirm the identity of the victim. According to Eyewitness News they have seen a statement
which the domestic worker made at the police station on Sunday night, detailing
how Manana allegedly assaulted her. The woman claims that he pushed her down some stairs and
then threatened to track her down anywhere she goes. She says that she now fears for her life. EWN reports that the woman also accused him of threatening
to deport her to Zimbabwe because he “has connections everywhere”. The former deputy minister was convicted of assaulting two
women at Cubana Fourways last year. That attack was caught on camera, he paid a R100,000 fine after
admitting to the charges or face 12 months in prison‚ and 500 hours of
community service in November.
