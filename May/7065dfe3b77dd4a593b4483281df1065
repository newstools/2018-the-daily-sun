WHEN darkness falls and her kids start crying, Nose Motaba (30) prepares for battle. She said something approaches and makes a noise on her roof. Then her house is invaded by three evil people who demand to drink her children’s blood. Nose, from Khayelitsha in Mangaung, saidher nightmare started after her boyfriend lost his job in September. Since then the family has been living in poverty. “When night falls, my kids start crying and I know hell is coming our way,” said Nose. “On Monday, my kids struggled to breathe. They were afraid the women were coming back. “We can see them approaching. I have to fight them if I want them to disappear. “Before this curse, I was living a happy life with my boyfriend and kids. “I think these women are after my children for rituals. They want to kill my children so they can have their blood. “We’re appealing for help from anyone who can help us get rid of this curse.” Nose’s kids are seven months and two months old. Neighbour Kamohelo Mefane (33) said: “I got up one night at 2am after I heard a child crying. “I saw three women dressed in blankets. When I questioned them, they said they were there for the children. “They claimed they wanted to perform rituals with children’s blood. “I was shocked but I couldn’t call the cops because they disappeared.” Sangoma Ndabazomoya Sotshononda said the family must look for a traditional healer to cleanse their house and kids. “I believe the women are witches who use children’s blood to gain power.”
