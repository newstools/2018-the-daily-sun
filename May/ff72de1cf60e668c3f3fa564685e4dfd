FOUR Ugandan friends were looking forward to celebrating Africa Day with a braai on Thursday night. But when they sat down to eat, they didn’t realise they were tucking into their last meal. When they went to bed, they took their braai stand into their house in ThabaNchu, Free State, to keep warm. They probably ended up dying of carbon monoxide inhalation. A neighbour said the men were very happy when they started their braai in the evening. “They were renting a house together. They spoke about how excited they were to celebrate Africa Day on Friday,” said the neighbour. “On Thursday afternoon, they gathered and had a braai later in the evening. They celebrated the evening with laughter and were speaking their language as if they were at home. “They were very friendly to neighbours and referred to them as their brothers and sisters. I was shocked when I saw the yard full of ambulances and police the next day.” Free State Health spokesman Mondli Mvambi said the men were declared dead at the scene. “One of their friends realised something was wrong when he called them and there was no answer. When he went to the house, the keys were still in the door. He called the cops, who forced their way in to investigate.” Police spokesman Sergeant Martin Xuma said an inquest docket was opened. “The victims were aged 29, 32, 36 and 40. A post mortem will determine the cause of their deaths.”
