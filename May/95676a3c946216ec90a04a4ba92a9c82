ON SATURDAY, thousands of mourners said their final goodbye to Motsweding FM presenter Modiko Mothupi . The 56-year-old who died after a long illness last Monday, was laid to rest at Mmabatho Cemetery in Mahikeng, North West. SABC news assignment editor Winston Mphahlele said: “He was a disciplined, dedicated and determined announcer, DJ and host. “Modiko was a colleague who spent most of his life in broadcasting. He did not join the SABC for gain but because of his passion.” His friend and colleague Lawrence Kuntwane said he hoped one day another such quality person would promote Tswana music. “Our emerging presenters could take a leaf out of Modiko’s life. He was a simple man who never saw himself as a celebrity. He was the voice of the station.” Neighbour Judge Bafshoe said he was a lively person who loved God. “He believed in himself and always encouraged people to work hard. Modiko always fought against the abuse of women and children,” he said. “He played a big part in making sure we became one big family. I will miss him and hope God will grant his family peace.” His daughter Keorapetse said the family will always be grateful for their father. “You encouraged us to study hard as you believed in education. We hope you will always look down on us from heaven,” she said. ANC acting provincial secretary Susan Dantjie said Modiko contributed to Mzansi’s development.
