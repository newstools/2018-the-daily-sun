FIFTEEN people were arrested in Tshwane at the weekend and
charged with  drunk driving. One of them was soccer star Andile Jali. The Bafana Bafana midfielder and former Orlando Pirates
player was bust on Saturday night in Hatfield. The 28-year-old was detained at Brooklyn cop shop and
released on R1000 bail. Tshwane Metro cops spokesman Senior Superintendent Isaac
Mahamba said the 15 arrests were made between 10pm and midnight. “Tshwane Metro cops and other law enforcement agencies
conducted a drunk driving operation,” Mahamba told the People’s Paper. “Fifteen people were arrested for driving under the
influence. “Among the 15 people arrested is a 28-year-old former
Orlando Pirates player currently playing for the national soccer team.” Mahamba said drunk driving is one of the major causes of
fatal crashes. “Any person found driving while intoxicated will be
arrested,” he said. “The Metro police will continue to intensify these drunk
driving operations. “Endangering innocent lives on our roads won’t be
tolerated.” Jali previously played for KV Oostende in Belgium. He was part of the
South African squad at the 2009 Fifa U-20 World Cup in Egypt.
