Hi MizzB I am a 23-year-old woman who is addicted to sex. I enjoy meeting strangers and sleeping with them. I go on dating sites for hook-ups. After Iâ€™ve had sex with someone, I want nothing more to do with them. I am never satisfied in the bedroom and have to masturbate to please myself.    I want to stop.
