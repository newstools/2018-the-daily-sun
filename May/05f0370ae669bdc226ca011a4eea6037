THE Luma family in Thabong, Welkom, is looking for a missing relative. Nthabiseng Luma (26) went missing last March after she left home to attend a funeral in her kasi. Her relatives have not heard her from her for a year and are worried about her. Nthabiseng’s aunt, Mantja Luma (41), said when her niece didn’t come back home on the night of her disappearance, she asked her friends where she was. She said: “I was worried because she was still breastfeeding her daughter. “I also noticed that all her clothes were missing. “I later learnt that she and her friends said they were going to look for employment at the grape farms in Upington.” Mantja said Nthabiseng called her a week after her disappearance to let her know she was fine. “She told me not to worry and said she was working to take care of her daughter. “Sadly, that was the last time we spoke. “She never sent any money to us. “All her friends have come back but no one has heard from her. “The friends told us she left Upington months ago and changed her cellphone number. “We are worried something bad has happened to her,” said the aunt. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane said a missing person’s case has been opened for investigation at Thabong cop shop. “The investigating officer assigned to find the missing woman is Detective-Warrant Officer Brian Mtileni. He can be reached on 078 887 7063,” said Mokhuoane. She said anyone with information should contact their nearest police station.
