ALTHOUGH gogo Humane Mojaki is 84 and has eyesight problems, it doesn’t stop her from reading the People’s Paper every day. She told the SunTeam she made sure she could cope with reading the paper she had been buying since it only cost R1,20. The gogo from section C1 in Botshabelo, Free State, said her love for the newspaper had earned her the nickname Mamgobhozi. The only thing that would make her stop reading the newspaper was blindness or death. “What I love about this newspaper is that it made me famous in my area because I know all the news,” she said. “When people hear rumours, they consult me to ask if it was reported in Daily Sun. I can then confirm or deny it.” Gogo Humane said she hated it when her family members read the newspaper before she had a chance to read it. “I feel like they take away a piece of me when they read it before me so they don’t do it any more,” she said. “I have a son-in-law who gives me money to buy Daily Sun on weekdays and Sunday Sun over the weekend. “When I don’t have the money, the spaza owner lends me a copy.” The gogo said her favourite story ever was one published on 11 June 2015 about a hero cop who saved a girl. The gogo’s son, Abe (52), said he hoped his mum would win the grocery competition one day as she entered every week. Her daughter Matshidiso Ramabodu (57) said: “My mum will be turning 85 on the 15th. I hope she keeps her eyesight so she can continue reading the newspaper. “We love her so much.”
