NOKUTHULA Siyoyo told Daily Sun life was good. “I never knew I could be treated like a queen,” said the 29-year-old woman. She said she was in an abusive relationship, but then met Siyabonga Mbongi (31) while searching for scrap metal in Mitchells Plain, Cape Town, last year. She said ever since she met Siyabonga, life has been good. “It’s better to be with someone who respects you,” said Nokuthula. The SunTeam met the lovers while Siyabonga was pushing Nokuthula in a love wagon he had made from a shopping trolley and an old bathtub. “I push her in the trolley with the scrap metal we collect because I don’t want her to get tired. I can’t let her walk all the way home and still expect her to cook,” he said. Siyabonga said he wants to marry her. They live in a shack in Siqalo squatter camp and they don’t have kids. Siyabonga said when he met Nokuthula, he knew right away she was the one. “I was afraid to approach her at first, but because I had strong feelings for her I had to tell her how I felt,” he said. “When I met her I was single and she was in a bad state. All I did was give her love.” The couple wake up early in the morning and go around kasis looking for scrap metal. Siyabonga said he feels bad when he reads stories about men abusing women. “Men who abuse women are not worthy of being called men. Real men don’t abuse the people they love,” said Siyabonga.
