Mamelodi Sundowns will play Spanish giants Barcelona on 16 May at FNB Stadium (8pm). Sundowns president Patrice Motsepe confirmed that the club will play hosts to the LaLiga giants later this month.  The Absa Premiership champions once met the Spanish giants in a friendly match back in 2007 and that encounter was won by the Catalan giants won 2-1. As part of the agreement says Barca should bring along the likes of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta, who is leaving the Catalan giants at the end of June. "The plan was to make the announcement on Monday in Spain. Somehow it got into the public domain and there has been so many enquiries," Motsepe said on Metro FM's The Ultimate Sport Show on Friday evening.
