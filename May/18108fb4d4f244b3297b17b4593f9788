The Hawks have arrested two people for court for
allegedly defrauding the Department of Education of approximately R6 million. The two appeared in the Nelspruit Regional‘s Court on Thursday. HAWKS spokesperson Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi  said 
Nkosinathi Mbombi (45), and Elizabeth Zitha (60), were arrested  following lengthy investigations by the
hawks’ Serious Commercial Investigation Unit. She said the pair was served with summons on 22 March
2018 to appear in court. “It is alleged that in 2011 the accused submitted several
fraudulent invoices to the Department of Education for services intended for a
National School Nutritional Programme which were never rendered,” said
Sekgotodi. She said Mbombi who is employed by the department of
Health was apparently instrumental in recruiting owners of various companies to
submit these invoices. The money was allegedly deposited into the said
businesses accounts as well as individual accounts and was subsequently
withdrawn and shared amongst them. The suspects were
released on warning with strict conditions. They are expected back in court on June to face more than 37 counts of fraud, theft
and money laundering.
