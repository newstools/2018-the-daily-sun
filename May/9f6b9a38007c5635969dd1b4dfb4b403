THE road to success has been bumpy for Dr Nkosinathi Shongwe. The 25-year-old said it was by God’s grace he graduated with bachelor of medicine and bachelor of surgery degrees last week at the University of KZN’s Westville campus. He took the two degrees at the same time. He was involved in a horror car crash in 2015. His friend Tumelo Seliane, who was also a medical student, was driving. He lost control and the car overturned. He died on the spot and Nkosinathi and three other students were severely injured. He said he was in hospital for about a month. “I was unconscious and when I eventually woke up I had lost my memory. I only got better after three months,” he told Daily Sun. As a result, he was forced to stay home for a year. He said one of the other three survivors died in another car accident in 2016. Nkosinathi who’s from Newcastle, northern KZN, now works at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital. “I would have loved to share this day with my friends,” he said.
