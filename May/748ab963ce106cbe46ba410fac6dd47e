THE KZN Health Department is still reeling from shock following Dr Ndabayenkosi Nondonga’s death. The 29-year-old young doctor from Mthatha in the Eastern Cape was killed in a car crash on Wednesday. His car collided with a truck on the Uthukela Bridge between Mandeni and KwaDukuza on the N2 highway. The doctor, who worked at Eshowe Hospital, died on the spot. He was on his way to work when the accident occurred. He graduated from the University of KZN in 2015 and joined the hospital in the same year as a community service doctor. Nondonga was regarded as one of Eshowe’s best in the obstetrics and gynaecology unit. Heath MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said that the pain of losing such a young and dedicated doctor was unbearable. “Even though he was a young man, he chose to work in a rural area,” said Dhlomo. “It’s not often that you find young doctors wanting to work in rural hospitals. “Losing such a son who had a bright future is a great pity. We really mourn his loss.” The MEC said officials from his department will make time to visit Nondonga’s colleagues to comfort and support them. “We wish to send our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.” Eshowe Hospital CEO Nhlanhla Sangweni described Nondonga as one of the best doctors in his unit. “He was always willing to help at the needed time,” he said.
