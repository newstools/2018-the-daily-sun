MADALA Elias Tshabalala (77) enjoyed life as a retired man. Nothing made him happier than farming on his rented plot in Nooitgedacht, outside Cosmo City, Joburg. But his joy came to an end when a new neighbour moved in next door. Madala Elias claims the neighbour manhandled him and destroyed his plants. He said the ongoing clashes with his neighbour caused his wife to leave him. The madala said he moved to the area in 2009. His nightmare started when his neighbour moved in last year. “A few months after his arrival, he drove into my yard with his bakkie and drove all over my plants. When I went to confront him, he said he and the police were chasing thugs. I then went to the local cop shop but the police said they hadn’t responded to any criminal activity at my plot.” He thought the drama was over after he opened a case against his neighbour, but the worst was yet to come. “When my workers take sheep to the field, he fires shots into the air and warns them not to let my livestock graze in his yard. “Last Tuesday I told my workers to flatten the grass with a tractor. My neighbour told them they were making a noise and said he would beat them up. When I intervened, he manhandled me and threatened to kill me. “It’s sad how a young man can be so evil.All I wanted was to live a peaceful life.” The neighbour was not at home when the SunTeam went next door to get comment Police spokeswoman Sergeant Tshepiso Mashale said a case of malicious damage to property had been opened. No arrests have been made yet.
