 Four robbers, who stole a car in Cape Town on Sunday morning, drove straight to Pollsmoor Prison in an attempt to flee from police. Cape Town law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said the four men allegedly stole the car in the Hout Bay area. "They were then chased by police and drove straight to the West Lake entrance of the prison, which is used for visitors and the prison wardens who live on the property. They got out and ran into the grounds of the prison where they were arrested," Dyason said. He said when they were searched at the police station, it was found that they roughly had 35 cases of murder, attempted murder, theft and possession of illegal firearms pending against them. In a separate incident, five suspects were arrested in Muizenberg and Steenberg on Saturday for possession of mandrax. Dyason said the suspects allegedly tried to bribe officers in a bid to avoid prosecution.Â   Two other suspects were arrested after the car they were travelling in was pulled over by police and were found in possession of a replica firearm, a crowbar, knives and the City of Cape Town marked overalls. They were charged with possession of a replica firearm, possession of house breaking implements and possession of presumed stolen property. One suspect was also wanted on a 2014 Khayelitsha case for arms and ammunition.
