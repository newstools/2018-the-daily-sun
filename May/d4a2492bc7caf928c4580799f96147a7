TEN people bust over the Moses Mabhida Stadium incident had their court case postponed to next month. They appeared together for the first time in the Durban Magistrates Court on Friday. They face charges of public violence after allegedly damaging Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban in April  when Kaizer Chiefs lost to Free State Stars. They’re Siphosenkosi Memela (32), Sibongiseni Khumalo (29), Khwezi Madiba (35), Cebolendoda Hadebe (21), Douglas Mkhize (42), Lungisani Jaca (33), Nolwethu Cokotha (29), Zibongile Njova (27), Sihle Zungu (29) and Phelelani Jojisa (32). Eight have pleaded guilty. Jaca, who is suspected of starting the fire, has pleaded not guilty.  Jojisa, the first to be arrested, hasn’t pleaded. All 10 suspects are out on R1000 bail each. Magistrate Thembinkosi Ngema told them:  “All of you have been banned from attending any gathering . Should you be found attending any, bail will be cancelled and you’ll go to jail.” Ngema postponed the matter to 26 June. Zungu told Daily Sun he regrets damaging the stadium. “I love my team Kaizer Chiefs and was upset that we lost,” he said. “But it was not the first match we lost.  I don’t know what came over me on that day because I wasn’t even drunk. “This is the first time I was arrested in my life and it’s for something that I could have avoided.” Zungu said he’s  learnt his lesson.
