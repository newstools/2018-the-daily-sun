A FAKE metro cop was shot and wounded in Booysens Reserve, Joburg, on Sunday. The incident happened when the man and his friends, who were pretending to be officers, tried to hijack a couple. Captain Xoli Mbele said the 44-year-old and his wife were driving a Mercedes-Benz Vito. They were stopped by three men, two of whom were in metro cops uniform and  driving a VW Polo and Mercedes-Benz. “Two of the bogus officers came towards the driver’s door and pulled him out of the car while his traumatised wife watched. They pepper-sprayed him,” said Mbele. “In an attempt to save himself and his wife, the man pulled out a gun and fired several shots. “One of the suspects was shot twice in the upper body while his friends jumped into the victim’s car and sped off. “Police were called and the suspect was taken to hospital.” Joburg metro cops spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said they won’t allow the department’s name to be dragged in the mud. Minnaar said it’s a serious offence to impersonate a cop. “Bogus cops are damaging the image of the police,” he said. He advised motorists to call 08600 10111 to verify that they were being stopped by real cops.
