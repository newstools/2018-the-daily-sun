It's official. Premier Supra Mahumapelo's North West
province has been placed under administration. President Cyril Ramaphosa has decided to put the embattled
province under administration following weeks of unrest. Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said the
president has written a letter to the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). "The president has written to the chairperson of the
NCOP notifying the house of the decision to place the North West under administration
in terms of section 100 of the constitution. Mothapo said a process will ensue, through a committee or
committees of parliament who will have to make an assessment of the
circumstances that brought about this decision by cabinet. Mothapo added they needed to make an assessment of the
situation on the ground in North West to see if it warrants such an
intervention.
