MEMBERS of United Outcome Methodist Church in Browns Farm, Philippi have reached out to the elderly. They donated clothes and electrical appliances to the gogos of Sakhulwazi Women’s Hub earlier this week. Church member Luleka Mkhwela said it’s part of their work to help the community. “Every year we help different organisations and this year we chose Sakhulwazi,” she said. “We choose the most deserving place and each one of us bring something that would benefit a particular organisation.” Luleka said they donated clothes because some of the gogos look after their grandkids. “It’s important for churches to help where they can because many residents are poor.” Rose Makosa (67), a member of Sakhulwazi, said they were grateful to the church members for helping them. “This is the first time people have donated to our organisation,” she said. “We are happy because we really needed all these things they brought.” Rose said they didn’t know the church had programmes to help people who are not members. “We didn’t know that they also care about people who are not part of their church. We were surprised when they arrived with gifts.” Another gogo said the clothes came at just the right time for her grandkids. “Their mother died three years ago and I am struggling to look after them. I am happy that at least they will be warm this winter.”
