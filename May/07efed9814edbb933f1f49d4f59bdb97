AN 18-year-old woman was critically injured when she was
attacked by three dogs at her home in Heuweloord, Centurion on Wednesday
afternoon. ER24's Russel Meiring said paramedics were called to the scene
by members of the community. "When they arrived on the scene, paramedics found the woman
lying next to the garage." According to Meiring, members of the community had already
managed to move the three dogs away from her. "Paramedics assessed the woman and found that she had
sustained serious bite wounds to her head as well as her upper body, leaving
her in critical condition," Meiring said. "Treatment and advanced life support interventions were
immediately initiated, in an effort to stabilise the patientâ€™s vital signs." Once treated, the woman was transported to a nearby private
hospital for urgent medical attention. The cause of the incident is unknown at the moment.
