POLICE officers who have been accused of refusing to assist a housebreaking victim on Friday are in hot water. Officers stationed at Seshego Police Station allegedly refused to assist Sara Maponya (40) from Polokwane when she went to report the crime. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba said he was sickened by the allegations “She must give us her statement. This is disgusting. Those officers will be dealt with,” said Ledwaba. Sara said: “I screamed for help when I saw the thugs breaking my windows to gain entry into the house. “They left when they heard me scream. “I was shocked when the police told me they wouldn’t open a case because I didn’t have any suspects.” She said community members threatened to take the law into their hands because the police always fail them.
