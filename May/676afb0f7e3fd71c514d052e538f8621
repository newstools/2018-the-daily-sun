JOMO Cosmos’ veteran striker, Clifford Mulenga, is confident that they will bounce back against Black Leopards in the penultimate promotion/relegation play-offs match at the Thohoyandou Stadium, Limpopo tomorrow at 3pm. He promises to turn the tables around as they approach Ezenkosi with one thing in mind – VICTORY. It is indeed a tricky affair for Ezenkosi who will be visiting the lethal Leopards in their enclosure in Venda, and Joel Masutha’s side are at the summit of the mini-league table with five points. Victory for Leopards will see them back in the Absa Premiership – with an unassailable eight points. Cosmos and Platinum Stars have two points apiece. But Mulenga dares Leopards to repeat their dominance over them again, “this will never happen”. As permutations stand: Now it is in Cosmos’ hands to reclaim their Premiership slot, even though they have an intimidating uphill battle against the side that will have the Thohoyandou Stadium packed to the last seat. Cosmos have not defeated Lidoda Duvha in their last two matches, and that should be a serious concern having suffered a 3-0 demolition, which was followed by a 2-2 draw in the play-offs at Vosloorus Stadium. “Platinum Stars made us a huge favour over the weekend,” said Mulenga. Stars were held to a 2-2 draw by Leopards in Rustenburg on Saturday, which kept the race wide open and every team with a slim chance of making it. Mulenga said: “Our first games were disappointing but now we have a lifetime opportunity of turning around things. I believe we can make it, with the bunch of hard working players in the team. We can’t afford to let this opportunity pass without a fight. It could be our last in the NFD.” The Zambian striker also said they will be prepared for his compatriot Mwape Musonda, who has been banging in goals for Leopards – having already scored four in his two play-offs matches.
