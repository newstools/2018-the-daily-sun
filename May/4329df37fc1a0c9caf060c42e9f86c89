TWO families want answers from the City of Cape Town after graves were vandalised at Khayelitsha Cemetery. Lindiwe Tetyana (57) from Gugulethu told Daily Sun she was struggling to sleep since her son Onke’s grave was violated last Monday. “I buried my son in 2015 and I was starting to heal,” she said. “I’m happy the body wasn’t taken away. “But I’m scared the people responsible will come back.” Nhohno Mtakatya (46) said his dad William Wece was buried close to Onke in 2015. “We found the black hat he was buried in and casket pieces on the surface,” he said. “We need answers. There are security guards here.” Nhohno will rebury William. Lindiwe will organise a lunch after her son’s reburial. MMC for safety and security JP Smith said he’d meet with the families today. “We’ll do whatever we can, within limits of the law, to assist with proper reburial, respectful of customs and traditions observed by families. “In the meantime, we’ll cover the costs of removal and storage of the bodies. “While this is a terrible thing, the exhumations undertaken by the City will at least give the families some comfort as it shows the remains were not tampered with or are missing. “It’s unimaginable why somebody would do something like this. There’s no logical explanation.” He said he hoped police will investigate and that perpetrators will be brought to justice. Western Cape police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said: “A grave violation case was opened for investigation in Harare last Monday.”
