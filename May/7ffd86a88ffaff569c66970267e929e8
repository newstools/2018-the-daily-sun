THE Free State High Court in Bloemfontein has lifted the restraint order in the Vrede dairy case. The Court ruled in favour of Gupta linked companies and individuals who challenged a provisional restraint order that targets assets to the tune of R250 million. Judge Philip Loubser said yesterday that there was no evidence to keep the assets frozen. He said the evidence used by the National Director of Public Prosecutions showed many shortcomings. He said the court had to look at whether there was evidence that might reasonably support a conviction or consequent confiscation order. Oakbay and Aerohaven challenged the provisional restraint order. “Reasonable grounds are lacking for believing that the two entities concerned may one day be convicted of the alleged offences,” said Loubser. The Asset Forfeiture Unit got a provisional restraint order against eight Gupta employees in April, while a criminal case against them is pending. The court froze R180 million in assets of Estina director Kamal Vasram, a former director of the Gupta company Oakbay. Loubser said the evidence showed that millions of rands were paid by the Free State Department of Agriculture to the Estina Dairy Farm Project but it was not clear whether the amounts paid to Oakbay and Aerohaven flowed from the Estina deposits. He said the determining factor would only be if reasonable grounds existed for believing that a confiscation order might be made against the defendants in future. Estina made eight transfers from its Standard Bank account to a Bank of Baroda account between April 2013 and August 2014, totalling some R110 million. The accused were arrested during raids at different locations in February, including at the Gupta compound in Saxonwold and in Sandton. One hundred black emerging farmers at Estina were promised five cows each as part of the empowerment scheme but never received them.
