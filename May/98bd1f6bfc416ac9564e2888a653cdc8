Two years after the release of his last studio album titled Naninina, Vusi Nova is finally getting ready to release some new music. The soulful crooner has given fans a teaser of one of the songs that will be featured on his album. “Have u ever felt this way? Taste of 1 of the songs from my album comin' out in August featuring iintwana zam @047_za,” said Vusi. The song features new kids on the block, a trio by the name of 047 who will be releasing their debut album towards the end of May this year. The teaser is of a soulful, piano-based melody accompanied by Vusi’s timeless and beautiful voice. Yesterday, Vusi also gave fans another teaser, a studio shot of himself and Amanda Black captioned: “Amanda Black and I recording something special”. We cannot wait for the new album.
