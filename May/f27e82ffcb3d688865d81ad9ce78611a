LATER sunsets and cooler mornings are signs of the coming winter and its expected changes to our driving conditions. Here are tips on how to adjust your driving to best handle these changes. Leave earlier in the mornings or take alternate routes where and when the glare is not as bad. A pair of quality sunglasses, tinted or polarised, will also reduce the glare. Keeping your windscreen clean stops glare from obscuring your eyesight. You can also avoid glare by raising your seat position higher up. Lower your visor before you leave so you are not blinded suddenly as you turn a corner. Avoid the cost and even tragedy that can happen if you do not adjust for the change of seasons. It only takes a few changes to be ready and it can save you plenty.
