A lion that allegedly escaped from the  Kruger National Park was seen along the De Aar - Hanover road by a motorist on Tuesday night. Mpumalanga police advised motorists and the surrounding community to be cautious. It is alleged that it escaped earlier this week. Netwerk24 reported on Tuesday evening that the local traffic department had confirmed that the lion was on the loose. There were conflicting reports that the lion was darted,  but they could not be confirmed. Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency spokesperson Kholo
Nkambule told News24 its rangers responded to the tip-off and searched the
area. No trace of it was found. It resumed its operation on Wednesday. Nkambule said it was suspicious that it appears only one
person had supposedly seen the lion, as true sightings are usually reported by
a number of witnesses. Meanwhile, Kruger National Park spokesperson William Mabasa
said while it was aware of the reports, it had no record of a lion escaping
from their premises.
