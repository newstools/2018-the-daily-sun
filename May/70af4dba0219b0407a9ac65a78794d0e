FUTURE Mashamba was nine when he fell in love with horses. So strong is the bond between the 24-year-old and horses he now speaks to them. Future from Phiri in Soweto said he speaks with his horse Pocatello. He’s been riding the horse for two years. “Pocatello’s like a baby to me. We speak to each other,” he said. “Before I load him into the horsebox, I tell him we’re going to have fun and win the competition. “He responds by giving me a kiss and lowering his head down so I can touch his ears. “It’s easy for me to speak with horses. Maybe that’s why I’ve won so many competitions.” He started riding horses at the Enos Mafokate Equestrian Club in Soweto. He’s employed as a stable manager, teacher and rider at Southern Riding Club. “I groom horses from 8am to 5pm. I prepare lunch and dinner for them,” he said. During the day, he conducts horse-riding classes from 2pm to 4pm. His students range from beginners to advanced riders. “Between 4pm and 5pm, I attend jumping lessons in preparation for shows. Future said horses taught him how to love. “I know an animal and a human being can come together without any risk to the person,” he said. His dream is to open his own stable and compete in the Olympics.
