Former child star Mzambiya burst onto the entertainment scene in the year 2000 and he went on to make a lot of money at a young age. The Mele Senzeni hitmaker, whose real name is Nkosinathi Zwane, told Rams Mabote on Metro FM’s Fame and Fortune that he reckons he has made over R14m in his 20 year career in the industry. “I think I’ve made over R14M, plus minus,” he told Rams. The Soweto born star admits that a lot of that money was lost because he didn’t really know better. “I’m from an underprivileged neighborhood where most of our families are not educated that much, by that time the only thing i had was talent. “If you were to get a million today and you are not prepared for it, it would go in a flash,” he said. Mzambiya gives talks on financial literacy where he teaches people about the mistakes that he made with his money in order for them not to fall into the same trap. He also has the Mzambiya Foundation, which gives back to the underprivileged.
