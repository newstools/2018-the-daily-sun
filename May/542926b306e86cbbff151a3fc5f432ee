Rapper Kanye West has sparked fresh outrage on Tuesday when he said slavery wasÂ  "a choice." The rapper made the comments during an interview he gave as he promotes his two upcoming albums. Said Kanye: "You hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice." West elaborated little on his statement but appeared to be drawing a parallel to how he is presumed to hold certain views as an African American artist. "We're mentally in prison. I like the word 'prison' because slavery is too direct to the idea of blacks. Like Holocaust is Jews, slavery is blacks," Kanye told TMZ Live. His remarks immediately sparked an uproar on Twitter and he was taken to task live by a TMZ employee who said he was "appalled." "I actually don't think you're thinking anything," TMZ's Van Lathan quickly cracked back at West. Lathan said while West gets to live the elite artist's life, "the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats in our lives. We have to deal with the marginalisation that has come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was our choice."  SOURCE: CHANNEL24
