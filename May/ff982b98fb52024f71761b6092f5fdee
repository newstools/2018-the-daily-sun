THIS gogo turned 124 on Friday, but she can still hear and see clearly. Nkukuthane Mazibuko, according to the ID she showed Daily Sun, was born in 1894 on Mellodora farm outside Ottosdal, North West. She lives in Jouberton near Klerksdorp. She celebrated her birthday with her sister Beitsang Wesinyana (74), daughter-in-law Malerato Wesinyana and a few great grandchildren on Friday. Gogo Nkukuthane said her secret to a long life is that she respected the elders. “The young people of today don’t respect the elders. “I’m even scared to send them to the shops. They smoke and drink too much.” Gogo said the ancestors have protected and guided her. “It’s also important to eat healthily. When I was younger I didn’t eat eggs or sheep and cattle intestines. “I mostly ate vegetables and drank milk. I’m still alive and strong, even though I can’t walk properly.” Malerato, who looks after her, said: “I often wake up early in the morning to prepare breakfast for gogo Nkukuthane. “I also make sure the house is clean and that gogo is well fed every day.” Her birthday wish is to get a washing machine. She can’t afford one with her grant. The oldest verified person was Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 at 122 years and 164 days.
