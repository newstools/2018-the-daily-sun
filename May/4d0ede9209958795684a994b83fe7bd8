KASI residents call Mary Magoai a master slayer. This is because the 33-year-old from Orlando East, Soweto, can slaughter and skin a bull with impressive accuracy. Last Saturday, her family held a tombstone unveiling. When it was time to slaughter the bull, her relatives turned to her. Mary told Daily Sun she learnt the skill when she was a young girl. “There was an event and no one could kill the goat, so I learnt how to do it. “I’ve slaughtered several goats and cows since then,” she said. But she said her services are not always appreciated as some men felt she was invading their territory. “Some say they won’t eat meat from a cow that was killed by a woman, but I don’t listen to them. I know I can do it. “Some men think certain activities are reserved for them, but they must stop living in the past.” Traditional leader Veli Masango said women were previously not allowed to slaughter animals but things have changed. He said: “Women have entered areas which they previously weren’t allowed in.”
