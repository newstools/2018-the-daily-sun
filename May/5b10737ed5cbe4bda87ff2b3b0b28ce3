PROTESTING Sasco members blocked Nelson Mandela University campus entrances in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday. The students also disrupted exams and lectures. University spokeswoman Zandile Mbabela said: “We obtained a final court order stating the rules around operations start again. “The aim is to protect the rights and safety of those who want to use the university to work and study and take action against protesting students. “The order was requested last year and was never served but is still applicable and final.” SRC president Bamanye Matiwane yesterday told Daily Sun students wanted to bring attention to their struggles. He said they wanted free education, meals, textbooks and more shuttles to transport students who live off campus. Sasco yesterday said the university would be shut until further notice and communication from the university should be ignored and reported to student leaders. Mbabela said: “The university knows threats and voice notes have been circulating on social media.” He urged students to report these to campuscontrol@mandela.ac.za and to forward footage of protester vandalism and crime, as well as staff or students being forced off campus.
