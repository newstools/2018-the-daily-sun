THE list of items that were looted during the recent violent protests in North West is a long one. As always, groceries, clothes and liquor were taken by the boatload. But this time, a pricy coffin was also taken. The coffin was found in Jouberton, Klerksdorp, and many are wondering why anyone would steal it. Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said suspected looters were arrested at the weekend during track and recovery operations in Jouberton and Sannieshof. Mokgwabone said: “The recovered goods included groceries, clothes, booze, a cash dispensing machine, vehicles used to move the stolen goods, a casket and equipment which was stolen from an SABC TV crew. “The camera equipment, worth R300 000, was found thanks to a tip-off. “The latest arrests follow those made last week in Mmabatho and Mahikeng, where material looted from a local hardware store was recovered.” The SunTeam also saw young men helping themselves to women’s sanitary pads during a recent looting spree in Mahikeng. Since the unrest began, more than 400 people have been arrested and charged with looting and public violence. Police are maintaining a strong presence in areas such as Itsoseng, Delareyville, Taung, Pudimoe, Christiana, Dryharts, Khuma, Ikageng, Kanana, Alabama, Sannieshof, Jouberton, Schweizer-Reneke, Bakerville, Coligny and Blydeville. “The arrests include five suspects who were caught in Taung for the attempted murder of a community policing forum member,” said Mokgwabone. Some of the suspects have already appeared in court, while others have been kept in jail until their bail application hearings. The team is expected to report back to the ANC’s national executive committee next week. In the meantime, the provincial health department has been placed under administration.
