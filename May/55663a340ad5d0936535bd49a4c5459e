FLYING squad members were involved in a shoot-out with four suspected robbers near Dube Train Station in Soweto on Tuesday. While on patrol, the cops spotted a suspicious white Land Rover Freelander with four men inside. The car sped off, leading to a high-speed chase and wild shoot-out. Several bullets hit the cop car, but none of them were injured. The thugs abandoned their car and fled on foot. The car had been hijacked in Honeydew, north of Joburg, in 2016 and was used in several crimes around Gauteng. Cops found two pistols and an AK47, believed to have been used in violent crimes, inside the car. Captain Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun yesterday the suspects were still at large. “We’ve widened our search area to locate them,” he said. “We urge residents of Dube and anyone who might have information to come forward.”
