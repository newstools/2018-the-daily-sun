HIGHLY ambitious Baroka FC are expected to unveil Jabulani “S-Curl” Mendu as their assistant coach on 16 June when they are also set to confirm Wedson Nyirenda as their new coach. The former Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder will assist the Zambian mastermind who has also been at the helm of Zesco United and Zanaco in his coaching career. Nyirenda’s two-year contract with Baroka was welcomed by chairman Khurishi Mphahlele, who confirmed the appointment of the former Chipolopolo coach. Nyirenda, who also played for Chiefs in the 1990s, resigned as Chipolopolo coach last week to move to Ga-Mphahlele in Limpopo. “Mendu will be an assistant coach next season,” said SunSport’s source. “All that is left is for management to do is make the announcement about Mendu. They wanted the new coach to appoint his own technical staff but this is a good move, as Mendu knows our local players very well. He will come in handy for Nyirenda and guide him in the right direction, along with Doctor Khumalo.” The 41-year-old Boksburg-born mentor, known for his neat dreadlocks, has been working as Baberwa FC head coach, an ABC Motsepe League side. The club is apparently owned by Mphahlele’s brother. “Some of the Baroka players have played for Baberwa,” said source. “I am talking about the likes of Punch Masenamela and Mduduzi Mdantsane. “It seems Baberwa have a good relationship with Baroka and that is why Mendu is going there as assistant coach.” But Mphahlele denied any knowledge of Mendu coming to his club, “This is new to me,” he said. “I do not know anything about Mendu coming to Baroka. All I can confirm is the signing of Wedson Nyirenda as our new coach.” Morgan Mammila, Baroka’s chief executive, said they aimed to show they mean business this time around, and that everything would become clear on Youth Day. “Just wait and see. We want to be among the best in the coming season. But I cannot confirm anything before 16 June,” he said.
