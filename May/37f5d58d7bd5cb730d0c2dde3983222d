NO SOLUTION was found to stop the fighting between residents of Siqalo and Mitchell’s Plain during a meeting between the communities on Thursday. Residents of Siqalo, Cape Town, this week protested over housing and angered the people of neighbouring Mitchell’s Plain when they burned a fruit and vegetable stall in the area on Wednesday. Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, Community Safety MEC Dan Plato and Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela spoke to community leaders at Lentegeur Police Station. Madikizela said: “We understand emotions are high but we are here to restore calm and order.” Siqalo residents claimed a group of about 70 people from Mitchell’s Plain started shooting at them on Wednesday night. Gubs Ndlazilwana (40) from Siqalo claimed gangsters from Mitchell’s Plain had been sent to terrorise them. Mitchell’s Plain resident Norman Roy said they worked hard for what they had and they didn’t understand why Siqalo residents wanted things for free. “We don’t care what they want. They must stop messing with us because we’re not government.” The meeting ended in chaos, leading to officials and Mitchell’s Plain residents walking out. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said police had to send reinforcements after a number of violent incidents late on Wednesday night. A 21-year-old man was killed when a taxi ploughed into him on Jakes Gerwel Drive. Philippi police opened a case of culpable homicide. Later, shots were fired from the Colorado side of the road, wounding two people, aged 36 and 51. Cases of attempted murder were opened. She said 39 suspects were arrested for public violence and that things had since calmed down.
