A woman, believed to be 24 years old was killed after a two-vehicle collision at the Kliprivier and Swartkoppies Road intersection in Patlynn, south of Joburg. ER24 paramedics were returning to their branch when they were flagged down by passing motorists on Tuesday night. On scene, paramedics found a light motor vehicle lying on its side in a ditch, some distance away from the road. Another light motor vehicle was found a short distance away. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said that upon closer inspection, paramedics found the body of a woman lying inside the overturned vehicle. "Unfortunately, the woman had already succumbed to her numerous injuries. Nothing could be done for her and she was declared dead. "The driver of the other light motor vehicle was assessed and found to have escaped injury," said Meiring. The local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
