The Gupta family are not
going to give up their jet without a fight. The fugitive family is
expected to apply for leave to appeal a ruling by the South Gauteng High Court
on 19 March. The court ordered them to
return a luxury jet that they were leasing from a Canadian company. A few days later, on 23
March, the Guptas lodged their application. It is reported that the
Guptas were given 15 days to return the jet, a Bombadier 6000, to a hangar at
the Lanseria International Airport. Export Developments Canada
(EDC), the company that financed the jet, had previously submitted an
application to have the jet returned to them. The company that owns the
jet, Stoneriver, had claimed in their court application that there were a few
breaches of the lease agreement between October and December 2017. Judge Fayeeza
Kathree-Setiloane ordered Gupta-owned Westdawn Investments to return the jet
within 15 days. She also said that if they
do not return the jet, the South African Civil Aviation Authority will cancel
the jetâ€™s registration. She also ruled that the
Guptas or any of their entities were not allowed to use the aircraft.
