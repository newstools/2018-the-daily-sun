RESIDENTS of an occupied area named Zikode took to the streets yesterday. After invading land near Good Hope in Germiston, Ekurhuleni a few weeks ago, they’ve been evicted a number of times but refuse to leave. They closed off the streets yesterday to show their dissatisfaction with being excluded from the municipality’s budget speech last week. Nomnikelo Sigenu of Abahlali Basemjondolo said squatter camps in Germiston and surroundings were not mentioned in the budget speech. But yesterday’s protest did not go down well with some Good Hope residents. Community leader Oliver Silele told Daily Sun: “They’re not part of us. They belong to Abahlali. They’re not doing this with us.” He said protesters stopped people from going to work and kids from going to school. Zikode is about 2km from Good Hope, but the protests have been taking place right next to Good Hope. Sigenu said this was because the road there was busier. Two weeks ago, Human Settlements MMC Lesiba Mpya visited the area. He arranged to meet with community leaders but, according to residents, the meeting never happened. Good Hope has been earmarked for a project to build residential flats for residents.  But Zikode people have said they want serviced stands where they can build houses. Abahlali went to court last week to prevent the government from evicting squatters but the court did not rule in their favour.  Police were on high alert yesterday.
