It must be nice to be engaged to a hunky model and casually twerk for him poolside early in the morning hey? Well, judging by Phindile Gwala’s latest Instagram post, it surely is very nice. So nice, in fact, that she captioned it: “Stupidly in love”. The actress has been known to work out with her model and entrepreneur fiancé, Armando Ngandu. Today, Phindile shared a video of their latest workout routine, in which they jam the calories away in sexy black tights. Needless to say, Phindile goes all the way down and twerks for her man, much to his delight. Armando re-posted the video and called Phindile his woman crush every day. The piece is put together by celebrity choreographer Vusi Majola.
