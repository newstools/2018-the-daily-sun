CAPE TOWN CITY are on the verge of securing the services of veteran defender, Thabo Nthethe. SunSport has reliably learnt that the Citizens coach Benni McCarthy is eyeing the 33-year-old player as replacement for Robyn Johannes, who will join Bidvest Wits at the end of the season. The versatile player has seen little action (two games) in Mamelodi Sundowns’ colours this season as he was relegated to the stands.Coach Pitso Mosimane prefers the pairing of Bangaly Soumahoro and Motjeka Madisha or Ricardo Nascimento at centre back, while Anele Ngcongca or Thapelo Morena occupies the right-back position where Nthethe also operates. The fact that Nthethe is in his final sixth-month stretch of his contract means he can negotiate with any club interested in his services. This gave City boss John Comitis a chance to start negotiations. This means Downs won’t be able to cash in on the player, as he will leave for free in June. He was close to joining SuperSport United in the January transfer window, but the move fell through on deadline day. Said the source: “Benni rates Nthethe highly. He jumped at the chance to try and lure him to his stable when he noticed that Nthethe was not getting a run at Sundowns. He also asked Comitis to start negotiations early, which shows he wants to build his defence around Nthethe next season.” The source said Nthethe was also considering returning to Bloem­fontein Celtic, who offered him his professional debut in 2004. “Celtic plan to add him to their technical setup when he retires, if he takes up the offer,” added the source. Nthethe was not available for comment yesterday.
