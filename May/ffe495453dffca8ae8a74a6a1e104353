THE three girls from Umlalazi were the best of friends and often walked to school together. But the only way to get there was to cross the dangerous Matimofu River in Umlalazi in Eshowe. On Wednesday, heavy rain saw the river flowing even stronger but the girls apparently tried to cross – and all were swept away. The bodies of Nontethelelo Mcanyana (18), her niece Zenande Gumede (14) and their friend Sinikiwe Mpanza (17) were found lying on the river bank. Nontethelelo’s sister, Sinenhlanhla Mcanyana (28), said their deaths had left them in shock. “Nontethelelo, Zenande and Sinikiwe were best friends who were always together. “They had big plans for the future as they wanted to become successful businesswomen,” said Sinenhlanhla. She said the family had suffered a huge loss. Sinenhlanhla said they had received the news from neighbours. “Although Sinikiwe was our neighbour and Nontethelelo and Zenande’s friend, she was like family. She loved us and treated us as her family,” she said. Msawakhe Mayisela, spokesman for the KZN Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, offered his condolences to the families. He told Daily Sun several areas in northern KZN, including Umkhanyakude, areas in the Zululand district and Umlalazi municipalities had been affected by the floods. “Our disaster management team is providing assistance where necessary,” said Mayisela. He urged everyone who lived near rivers to be alert and said people shouldn’t attempt to cross fast flowing streams and rivers. He also cautioned motorists to avoid driving over small bridges in the flood affected areas. He said more heavy rain was expected until today.
