Two men who allegedly blockaded a taxi and then assaulted its driver, before shooting and wounding a passenger, have been arrested, Johannesburg police said on Sunday. The men are believed to be part of a gang of four who were apparently involved in the crime in late February this year, said Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo. At the time, the robbers used a car to corner off a taxi travelling in Houghton. "The four men, armed with handguns and a hammer demanded that the driver open the door. When the driver refused, one of the suspects broke the window with the hammer." The driver was then apparently assaulted and removed from the taxi, before the gang then robbed and shot a passenger, Shaghani Bashir – before fleeing the scene. Bashir was taken to hospital and survived the attack. Naidoo said that while there was initial speculation that the attack had been a 'hit', police investigations revealed that the motive had, in fact, been a robbery. The two men, aged 32 and 35 respectively, were arrested on Friday, in Ivory Park in Thembisa. They will appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on a number of charges including attempted murder and armed robbery. Naidoo said that the men are considered a flight risk and therefore bail would be opposed by the state. SOURCE: NEWS24
