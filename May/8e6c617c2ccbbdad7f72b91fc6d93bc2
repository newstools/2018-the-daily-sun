COPS are human too. Whenever protesters attack the law’s servants, they infringe on their human rights. This was one of the issues tabled at a dialogue on human rights and policing hosted by the South African Human Rights Commission in Braamfontein, Joburg yesterday. Independent Police Investigative Directorate head Robert McBride said whenever protests turned violent, there was a chance there would be deaths. “People have the right to protest but they also have responsibility for doing it in terms of the law,” he said. He said some protestors thought it was okay to throw stones at the police. “When you throw a stone at a person, what is your intention?” he asked. Captain Jeremiah Matlokwane said police were often attacked at protests, especially illegal ones. The commission’s Kwanele Pakati said there was a memorandum of understanding between cops and the commission. It aimed to create room for partnership between the two organisations. “We want to train the SAPS to be able to respect human rights more or to have a better understanding of human rights. “This is not to say they don’t know anything about human rights,” he said. Takalane Ramara, director at the Civilian Secretariat for Police Services which monitors cops, said they assisted the public when police didn’t render services effectively. “You can come to us and we will follow it up with the police.” He said they were based in Tshwane and that people can reach them on 012 393 2500.
