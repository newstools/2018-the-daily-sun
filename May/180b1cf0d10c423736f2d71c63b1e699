THE gang of five thought they could make easy money. But little did they know Bloemfontein’s public order cops were hot on their heels. On Monday, three men and two women were bust in possession of over R200 000 in fong kong notes. They were allegedly planning to exchange it at a bank in the Bloemfontein CBD. After cops received a tip-off, no time was wasted in bringing the suspects to book. Free State Hawks spokesman Captain Sfiso Nyakane said the five suspects aged between 29 and 48 appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court on Tuesday on charges of being in possession of fake money and money laundering. They were granted bail of R1 500 each. Nyakane said the suspects from Welkom were arrested after police stopped their Chevrolet Aveo near the train station. The vehicle was searched and cops found a red shoebox containing over R200 000 in fake notes. “They will appear in court again on 8 June,” he said.
