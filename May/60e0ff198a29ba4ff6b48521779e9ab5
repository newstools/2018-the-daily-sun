HE’S YOUNG, good looking and lives like a king. Thato Goapatwe was admired on social media, drives fast cars, and wears the coolest, fanciest clothes. BUT THE HIGH-FLYER’S WINGS HAVE BEEN CLIPPED BY THE HAWKS. But he and four others have now been arrested following the heist in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, last week. Two cash vans were blown up during the daring heist. Photos of Thato, with expensive luxury cars in the background, went viral on social media after his arrest. If he’s not posing with cars, he’s carrying bags while out shopping. The location attached to the photos place him in Sandton, playground of the rich, the famous and infamous. In one of the Facebook photos, he’s seen posing with a Mercedes Benz GLE 430 AMG worth over R1,3 million. The caption reads: “This is how my day looks like. With God, everything is possible.” He seems to like Gucci, a brand often featured in his photos, and he doesn’t mind saying he goes for facials. Gucci, fast cars and facials may become a thing of the past if he’s tried and found guilty of attempted murder, robbery, possession of explosives, illegal firearms and ammunition, and malicious damage to property. Heavily armed, trigger happy thugs ambushed two cash vans in Boksburg last Thursday and blew them up, after which the scary sound of gunfire filled the crisp morning air. They looted the vans’ contents and fled the scene, leaving money scattered all over Atlas Road. Thato, along with four other men, if found guilty and convicted, is likely to swap fancy designer clothes for course, orange prison hand-men-downs. Hawks spokeswoman Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said Thato, along with four other men, appeared in the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The suspects will appear again in court next Monday. Thato was among the suspects arrested at the George Goch Hostel, just outside Joburg, following a dramatic, high-speed chase that started in Boksburg.
