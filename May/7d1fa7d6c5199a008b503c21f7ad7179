The DA will on 15 May table its motion of no confidence
against Premier David Makhura in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. DA says  It cannot
be business as usual for the Premier who is ultimately responsible for a gross
miscarriage of leadership by his provincial government. The Party said the ethical and moral accountability for
144 Life Esidimeni deaths, and the suffering of thousands more, lies squarely
with Premier David Makhura. Said DA: "144 Esidimeni patients suffered cruel and
unnatural deaths because no one in the Gauteng government was heeding the
warnings that a tragedy of epic proportions was unfolding. "The individual tasked with oversight in our
province, Premier Makhura, refused to hear and refused to see, even when
presented with overwhelming evidence of the human disaster that was occurring. "Perhaps
because it was inconvenient, perhaps because it was easier to leave the
difficult decisions to others." DA said that what the Premier did do, was outsource the
care of the most vulnerable in society, to unlicensed NGOs which, in his own
admission, was, and is, a primary responsibility of the state. He said he was
‘unaware’ that patients would be sent to NGOs as he ‘thought’ that there were
enough beds for them in state hospitals. "The fact is, the Premier simply didn’t care enough
to establish the facts." The party says the Premier’s core mandate is to ensure
that, under his watch, services are delivered that enhance the wellbeing of all
the provinces’ residents, including the mentally ill. "And he failed. As the custodian of Gauteng’s 14.3
million residents, avoidable deaths on this scale, is reason enough for Premier
Makhura to vacate his position."
