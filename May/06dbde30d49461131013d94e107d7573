A SCHOOL pupil (22) accused of killing her own kid appeared yesterday in the Ngqeleni Magistrates Court, charged with murder. Ongeziwe Ngozi allegedly told her baby daddy via a WhatsApp message she planned to kill herself and two-year-old Lunabile. The toddler was found dead at the family home in Dumasi Village in Ngqeleni, near Mthatha in Eastern Cape, on 24 March – two days after her mum sent the message. Ongeziwe’s gogo Nontuthuzelo (59) said she was at a funeral when villagers came to tell her the child was sick. “I looked after Lunabile when her mum was at school. She was a brilliant child,” she said. “I was heartbroken when I heard Ongeziwe was behind the child’s death.” Jejani Ntuthu, a relative and village headman, said he rushed to the family home after Nontuthuzelo had told her the kid was sick. “When I got there the little girl was already dead,” he said. “She was foaming at the mouth and nose. “After the funeral, the child’s other grandparents came to see us and showed us a picture of a coffin and a threat to kill Lunabile that Ongeziwe had sent the father.” Jejani said a post mortem confirmed she was strangled. Nomandla Senzeni, the mum of Ongeziwe’s boyfriend, said when she saw the WhatsApp message, she decided to go to the Ngozi family first before reporting the matter to cops. Ongeziwe’s case was postponed to 15 June. She was bust in March.
