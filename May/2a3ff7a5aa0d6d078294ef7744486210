WORKERS at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in Joburg downed
tools on Thursday. They were demanding the performance bonuses that were due
to them from 2015. When the Department of Health previously promised to
remedy the workers' grievances, workers continued with their duty. But after a negotiation meeting that was supposed to take
place didn't, the workers became fed up. Once again, they blocked entrances to Charlotte Maxeke
Hospital and promised to make it ungovernable until they are given their money. The ongoing protest at Charlotte Maxheke continued, with
workers blocking the main entrances. They marched through the hospital, trying to shut down
different wards. "We are going to make hospitals in Gauteng
ungovernable," an employee who did not want to be named said. Workers have been demanding an 11% salary increase, and
have been engaged in negotiations with the Department of Health since March. "The MEC lied to the media when she said the matter
was resolved, because it is not," another worker said. PICS AND VIDEO: LUCKY MORAJANE
