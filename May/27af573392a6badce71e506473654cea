KwaZulu Natal Transport, Community Safety and Liaison MEC
Willies Mchunu has warned the community of KwaNobamba in Weenen, to voice their
concerns instead of destroying public infrastructure. He said they that they must use proper structures to raise
their concerns instead of causing public disorder. Mchunu, together with Social Development MEC Weziwe Thusi
and Agriculture and Rural Development MEC Cyril Xaba led the talks between the
KwaNobamba community and government representatives,. This comes after a disruptive service delivery protest that
saw the provincial road being damaged and blocked with stones and trees last
week. He has since directed senior transport officials led by Head
of Transport Sibusiso Gumbi to look into issues raised by the community
relating to transport and come up with a plan of how they will be addressed
