WHILE some say he is wasting money, others can’t wait to meet him and ask for a hand-out. But nobody knows what motivates Malcolm X’s generosity. However, he told Daily Sun there is a simple explanation for his big heart. “I grew up very poor, so I decided to share the little I have with the less fortunate.” Many have questioned how Malcolm makes a living. He is the owner of Malcolm X Consultants and 1651 Consultancy. Videos of him handing out money to students, elderly people and even the homeless have gone viral. “People are only realising it now, but I have been doing this since 2006. “I work with many NGOs because the vulnerable will always have a special place in my heart.” Malcolm said he isn’t rich. “But I use the little I have to make a difference. “People donate money to me so that I can give to others.” Malcolm has donated to hospices, old-age homes and schools around the country. His latest project is the Campus Challenge, where he goes to varsities and donates lunch money to students. Last week he was seen giving money to students at Stellenbosch University and the Cape Town University of Technology.
