THE joy of seeing a contractor working at the rundown Radira Secondary School was shortlived. Pupils and residents were shocked in July when the contractor stopped working at the school in Ga-Monyebodi Village outside Bochum. The contractor, who had partially demolished two blocks before he quit, said he had argued with the provincial education department. He was supposed to build two new blocks and a kitchen and had only been on site for a month. SGB member Percy Morane said: “We had two old blocks and they were in a fairly usable condition. Since they were demolished, we have nothing. Now we are forced to use battered mobile classroom.” Morane said they’ve paid several visits to the education department. However, they are always told to wait for the beginning of the next financial year. But nothing has been done. “We know they budgeted for those buildings, so where is that money? “We were shocked when they told us the contractor would no longer continue because of a disagreement they had. If that was the case, why didn’t they get someone else to finish the job because the money was already there?” He said the 2018/2019 financial year has begun yet the school has not received any feedback from the department. Limpopo Education spokesman Sam Makondo confirmed that the contractor was no longer working with the department. He said the process to appoint a new contractor was at an advanced stage. He said: “The site will be handed over soon.”
