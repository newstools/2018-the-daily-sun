Road Transport Management Cooperation (RTMC) has
welcomed the arrest of two traffic members in Limpopo. The two traffic officers were  arrested for alleged bribery. According to the RTMC the two, aged 29 and 30, were
arrested by members of the Road Traffic Management Corporation’s National
Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit and the Directorate of Priority Crime
Investigation (the Hawks) on Tuesday after they allegedly accepted a R200 bribe
from a motorist who made an illegal U-turn on R101 in Mookgopong. They are expected to appear in the Mokgopong Magistrate’s
Court on Thursday. The RTMC said Traffic officers are reminded that their
duty is to save lives and not to use their uniform as a license to solicit
bribes. Members of the NTP had been deployed in Limpopo to assist
in controlling high traffic volumes and ensuring safety on the roads over the
long weekend. "Bribery and corruption is a major concern in
traffic law enforcement and undermines efforts aimed at reducing road crashes,
injuries and fatalities," said RTMC. The two will also face internal disciplinary charges from
the RTMC for bringing it into disrepute. Limpopo MEC Makoma Makhurupetjie  said the province has been declared a zero
tolerance zone for those who are found on the wrong side of the law. She said  they  will arrest them even if it's they own.
