A MASSIVE prayer session is scheduled for next Friday at Alexsan Kopano Hall in Alexandra, northern Joburg. Religious leaders from different churches will put aside their differences and come together to pray for a single vision – the end to all the killings in Mzansi. The National Healing Prayer was officially launched in Naturena last year after the killing of many young women. Prayer organiser Prizzer Ndlovu said Alex was the perfect place to host the prayer session after the killings in the province over the past two months. She said the event was supported by many participants, including the Alexandra Taxi Association. “There are many violent deaths that have happened in the province. Last month four kids were burned to death in a shack and gang killings are totally out of control,” said Ndlovu. She said there was a need for all people and church members to pray for the nation in order to overcome the challenge the country was facing. National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete and Nomasonto Mazibuko, commissioner in the Albinism Society of SA, will be the main speakers.
