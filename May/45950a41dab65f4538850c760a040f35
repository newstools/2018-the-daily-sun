Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah feels optimistic he will overcome his shoulder injury in time to play for Egypt at the 2018 Soccer World Cup. The 25-year-old was forced out of the Champions League final after just 30 minutes following a tangle with Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos. The Egyptian FA tweeted that a scan on their star player revealed a "sprain in the shoulder ligaments". But an Instagram post from Salah late on Sunday evening revealed that he was planning on taking part in Russia. "It was a very tough night, but I'm a fighter," he wrote. "Despite the odds, I'm confident that I'll be in Russia to make you all proud. "Your love and support will give me the strength I need." Egypt play Uruguay on Friday, 15 June before facing Russia four days later on Tuesday, 19 June. Their final Group A clash will be against against Saudi Arabia on Monday, 25 June. It was a very tough night, but I'm a fighter. Despite the odds, I'm confident that I'll be in Russia to make you all proud. Your love and support will give me the strength I need.
