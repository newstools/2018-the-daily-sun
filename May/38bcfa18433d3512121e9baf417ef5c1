POLICE Minister Bheki Cele will host a social crime
prevention imbizo at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) in Soshanguve
on Friday. TUT students raised serious complaints about crime levels
that have turned the campus into a mini war zone with multiple cases of women
abuse on the rise. It's reported the latest attack took place last week, when a
first-year student was overpowered in a toilet and almost raped. The alleged rapist reportedly slapped her in the face and
stabbed her in the tongue to silence her screams. He was caught by a security guard and was arrested. "Hosting the imbizo is in line with the minister’s
pre-budget vote activities, which is aimed at intensifying the fight against
women and child abuse under the theme “Taking a firm stand for the safety of
women and children,” Cele's spokesperson Nonkululeko Phokane said. He will engage with the students on matters that are
affecting the campus life and further introduce intervention measures that will
stop all forms of crimes on campus and in the surrounding areas.
