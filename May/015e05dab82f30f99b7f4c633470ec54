We have been working day and night and doing everything we can." He said the money that was recovered was estimated to be about R1.6 million. "How we knew that the money belonged to us, is the bags have barcodes on and that is how we linked them." "We have our own advocate who will assist with the prosecution and the dockets." EMPD spokesperson Wilfred Kgasago said they received information from a reliable source in Langaville Ext 8 in the Brakpan area. Initially social media reports suggested that an amount of R1.5 million was found in the house.
