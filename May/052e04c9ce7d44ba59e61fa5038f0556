SCOTTISH Premiership giants Rangers sacked manager Graeme Murty on Tuesday, with Liverpool youth coach Steven Gerrard widely tipped to be his successor at Ibrox. Murty was only meant to be a short-term fix after being called in as caretaker boss following Pedro Caixinha’s sacking in October but he ended up staying in the post for six months. Ibrox chiefs, who have been in talks with former Liverpool and England midfielder Gerrard for the past week, say they hope to be able to release details about Murty’s successor “in the near future”. Gerrard (37) hung up his boots in 2016 after a 12-month stint with LA Galaxy and now manages the Liverpool under-18s Rangers’ 5-0 league humbling on Sunday by Old Firm rivals Celtic, who wrapped up their seventh consecutive Premiership title, came just two weeks after a 4-0 drubbing by Brendan Rodgers’ side in the Scottish Cup semi-finals. – AFP
