Former backing vocalist turned super-star, Thabsie says going from being behind the scenes to being in the forefront was very hard for her. The singer opened up to her fans on a recent episode of SABC 1‘s Real Goboza. When asked how she handles the ‘craziness’ of the entertainment industry, The Ubuyanini hit-maker said that in 2017, she was drowning. “It is insane. Last year I was drowning, I won’t lie. Everything was a first for me, I was trying to find my feet. This year I am starting to kind of get the hang of things and I have learned a lot. I think I had to go through that craziness,” she said. She went on to say that now that she has a little bit of experience with handling fame, she is much more prepared for whatever may come her way. “It is a lot of keeping to myself; a lot of planning and being prepared for things. last year I didn’t know what I was doing but this year I’m preparing more, I’m just taking control of my brand and who I am and being very hands-on,” she said. She then gave advice to young artists wanting to enter the entertainment industry. “Don’t say yes to everything because you’re very excited. I was very excited so I was taking everything on, anything that came. Sometimes you just need to go with your gut, it is so important to pave yourself,” said Thabsie.
