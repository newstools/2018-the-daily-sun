CAPETONIANS yesterday woke up to news that Patricia de Lille was no longer their mayor. And it’s all because of what she had said during a radio interview. DA federal council deputy chairwoman Natasha Mazzone said De Lille’s membership actually ceased on 26 April, the date she had an interview with 702. According to Mazzone, the former mayor was asked by talk show host Eusebius McKaiser: “Let’s say the morning after you win the legal case, however, do you really want to still be part of the DA?” De Lille replied: “No, no, no, no, I’ve said it many times before, Eusebius, you know, the writing’s on the wall that people don’t want me for whatever reason.” Later she said: “I will walk away. You summed it up correctly.” Mazzone said the party’s constitution provides that a member ceased to be a member when he or she publicly declared his or her intention to resign and/or publicly declared his or her resignation from the party. De Lille held her own press conference at the Cullinan Hotel. She said she had not been found guilty and that she would go to the Western Cape High Court on Friday. “The party has forced me to return to the courts. I will show on Friday that this so-called automatic cessation clause is unconstitutional and it was unfairly applied to me.”
