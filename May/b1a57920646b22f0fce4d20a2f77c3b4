THE community of a Kenyan county are in an uproar after
reports that three teachers moered a seven-year-old boy, allegedly seriously
damaging his private parts in the process. According to Daily
Nation, the incident happened last Thursday at Kamukunji Primary School in
Ol Joro Orok, Nyandarua County. The child is being treated for his wounds at Nyahururu
County Referral Hospital. One of the teachers was arrested on Saturday and is being
held at a cop shop. Cops are still hunting for the other two suspects, who are
on the run. Officials urged parents to be calm and not withdraw their
kids from the school, promising a full investigation into the incident. Governor Francis Kimemia said: “I am urging teachers in
our schools to show leadership in order to bring up a disciplined and morally
upright society. It is regrettable that teachers still impose corporal
punishment instead of using better means to handle the pupils.” There have also been angry calls for the education
director to investigate claims that some of the teachers owned taverns.
