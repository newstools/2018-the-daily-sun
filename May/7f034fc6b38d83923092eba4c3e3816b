THE situation remained tense in Keerom Village over the weekend after protesters burned two school offices and a police van last week. Two police officers were injured when residents of the village outside Groblersdal, Limpopo went on the rampage on Thursday. Administration blocks at Rehlahlilwe Primary School were burned on Thursday and another block was set alight at Leriana Secondary School on Friday. Motshana Tribal Office chairman Alfred Mafolo condemned the residents for engaging in a violent protest. “We are not happy about the RDP houses that have remained incomplete for the past three years. But the right channels should have been followed. Residents shouldn’t have burned schools and barricaded roads,” he said. “We are disappointed as the administration blocks held important information about the pupills.” Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba condemned the attack on police officers and encouraged cops to take the appropriate legal action to defend themselves. “Residents are expected to support the police instead of attacking them. Those who participated in this act are going to be hunted down until they are brought to book.” Seven suspects have been arrested and charged with malicious damage to property, arson and assault. They will make their first appearance in the Groblersdal Magistrates Court today.
