The residents of KwaMachi near Harding in southern
KwaZulu-Natal, have been hard at work digging for stones alleged to be gold. They allegedly heard that a person working on a road construction
project in the area had found gold. A resident told Daily Sun: “He saw a stone that looked like
gold last Wednesday and told his colleagues, who told residents of the area.” The resident said community members were selling pieces of
rocks that looked like gold for between R50 and R100. “People flocked to the area last week and started digging.
There were ululations and whistles when residents found what looked like gold,”
he said. The resident said people from other areas started arriving
in cars with spades on Monday and more arrived yesterday.
