TWO people in the Vaal are millionaires but they just don’t know it yet. The National Lottery on Monday announced that two tickets bought at a shop on Moshoeshoe Street in Sebokeng had won two jackpots worth over R25 million. The two tickets, bought almost a year ago, have not been claimed and time is now running out for the lucky residents to claim their winnings. Lottery operator Ithuba confirmed the tickets were bought at Ifalethu Trading Store. National Lottery spokeswoman Naledi Masopha said: “We are trying to reach the winners. We don’t know who they are. All we can trace is the name of the store and what times the tickets were purchased,” she said. The first ticket, which won over R21 million, was bought at 7.33pm on 30 June last year for R45 and the second, which won over R3 million, was bought at 4.47pm on 21 July for R22,50. They will both expire one year after they were bought. Masopha said they had tried various ways to establish who the winners were by making announcements on local radio stations and in several newspapers. She said if the winners were not found, the millions would be transferred to the National Lotteries Commission for the benefit of good causes.
