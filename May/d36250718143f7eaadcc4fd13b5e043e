A PLUMBER got the fright of his life on Monday when he
arrived to fix a broken toilet in a mall – and discovered the body of a dead
man stuck behind it. According to the Calgary
Herald, cops believe the man, thought to be in his 20s, climbed over a
small wall behind the loos in the women’s toilets in Core Shopping Centre in
Calgary in the southern part of Canada. It was thought he did so three days before his body was
found. No one knows why he climbed over the wall behind the
toilet, removed a vent on top of the wall, and climbed inside the small space
behind it, where he got stuck and later died. Investigators ruled out foul play in the man’s death. An
autopsy on Wednesday concluded that the man’s death was accidental. His identity has not been released, but his family has been
informed, cops said. The traumatised plumber who discovered the body has been
given time off by the shopping centre “to deal with whatever he may be going
through”, said the report.
