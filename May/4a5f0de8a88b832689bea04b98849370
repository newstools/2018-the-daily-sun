PUPILS from Umthombo Senior Secondary School in Plessislaer, Pietermaritzburg, are not pleased with the education department. The pupils want the school’s ranking to be changed from quintile 4 to 2. Quintile 4 and 5 schools receive less funding from government as they are thought to have pupils that come from well-off households. On the other hand, quintile 1, 2, and 3 schools take in mainly underprivileged pupils and receive more funding. A matric pupil (17) said the conditions they were forced to learn under were unpleasant. “We don’t have enough textbooks. “In some classes we share books while in others we rely on our teachers to make copies for us. “We raise funds to buy ink for the photocopying machine. “When we have not raised enough money, our teachers go to neighbouring schools to make copies,” said the pupil. He said the school doesn’t have enough desks, toilets or a security guard. “Some of our desks were donated by neighbouring schools. “They have enough money to buy new ones because they are in quintile 2.” A teacher said: “We don’t know why our ranking has not changed. “We don’t have enough resources. This will end up affecting the school’s pass rate.” School governing body member Mbalenhle Ngubane said the department needs to address the matter urgently. “The kids are now uncontrollable. “We tried to calm the pupils down by promising to call the department officials to address them, but they locked us out of the school. “We don’t know what to do now.” Education spokesman Sicelo Khuzwayo said the department was facing funding challenges. He said: “We made the school aware of that. “We will commit ourselves to solving the matter but currently there is no money.”
