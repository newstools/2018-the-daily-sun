WHEN residents heard a man begging for his life suddenly fall silent, they assumed he had been released. But they were shocked to find his body behind public toilets yesterday morning. A woman from K section, KwaMashu, north of Durban, found Sibusiso Ngidi (39) dead and covered in blood. The woman was on her way to work. She said in the middle of Tuesday night she heard people shouting that a whoonga addict must be killed. “He was crying and begging them not to kill him, but they kept on shouting he must die. “When it went silent later, I was afraid to go out and look,” she said. “I went to sleep hoping they had released him, but the next morning I saw him dead.” The victim was Sibusiso Ngidi (39). His sister, Sikhulile (32), said although her brother took drugs and abused the family, he did not deserve to be killed in such a manner. “I admit he was a whoonga addict and everyone knew that. “We even had to leave our home because he used to beat us after he had smoked his whoonga,” said Sikhulile. “But it pains me to see him like this. He still had a chance to fix his life.” Sikhulile said she was contacted by residents telling her that her brother had died. “At this point we do not know who killed him or why. “We did not find any weapons near his body, only bricks. “I think they hit him with bricks. Perhaps a hammer was also used as his legs look like they were broken,” she said. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said police were investigating.
