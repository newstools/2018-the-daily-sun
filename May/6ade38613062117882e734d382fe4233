THE QUICK thinking cheater calmed down his two fighting girlfriends by telling them he would marry them both. But only a few days later the older girlfriend decided she wasn’t ready to share her lover with anybody. NOW THE YOUNGER WOMAN IS DEAD. The woman APPARENTLY DIED FROM A HELPING OF RAT POISON IN HER PUDDING! It appears the lover was in bed with one of his girlfriends at his place in Croydon, near Isando, Ekurhuleni on Wednesday night. But then another lover, a 24-year-old from Esiphethweni Section in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni arrived to visit him. The two women almost got into a catfight but the boyfriend managed to calm them down with a simple promise: he said he would marry them both. The three then allegedly spent some time together under the same roof. But on Friday, the man allegedly left the two women alone when he had to go to a funeral in Limpopo . . . and that’s when the uneasy love nest allegedly turned into a place of horror. Ekurhuleni North police spokeswoman Captain Neldah Sekgobela said: “A 24-year-old woman was reported missing by her mother at Tembisa South Police Station on Wednesday. “Investigations revealed she went to Croydon where she allegedly visited her boyfriend, who was staying with another girlfriend under the same roof.” Sekgobela said the trouble must have started after the boyfriend left for Limpopo. “The older girlfriend allegedly felt jealous and poisoned the new one with rat poison in her pudding.” The case has since been transferred from Tembisa Police Station to the Sebenza Police Station after the body of a dead woman was found by a passerby in the veld in Isando. She allegedly had foam coming out of her mouth. Sebenza police spokeswoman Sergeant Sharon Mahamba-Tsotsotso said the body was identified by the family. “The suspect was arrested by Sebenza police. “She is facing charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice,” said Mahamba-Tsotsotso.
