ABUJA, NIGERIA - MILLIONS of youths addicted to a now banned cough syrup risk mental illness and even death. The addiction to codeine in the syrup, mostly by young people looking for a cheap high, is the latest crisis in the West African country’s battle against drug and substance abuse. Addiction to the cough syrup, excess use of which causes intoxication, is slightly higher in Nigeria’s northern region. Millions of young adults in the area are unemployed. At a recent sitting of the Senate, lawmakers disclosed that more than three million bottles of codeine syrup are consumed daily in Jigawa and Kano states alone. In a recent raid the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency seized about 24 000 bottles of codeine syrup from a single lorry in Katsina state. Codeine is an addictive medicine often prescribed to treat pain. It is mixed in with some cough syrups. Although legal in certain circumstances, consuming large amounts of it can cause addiction as well as subsequent mental disorders and organ failure. While codeine is largely imported, about 20 local pharmaceutical companies make the cough syrup. The syrup is commonly mixed with soft drinks. NOIPolls, a research firm, has identified marijuana, codeine and alcohol as the top three substances most often abused in Nigeria. The firm found the problem was worse among teenagers and young adults aged between 15 and 29 years of age. – CAJ NEWS
