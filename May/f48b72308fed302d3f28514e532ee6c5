THESE unhappy residents have found a new way to protest. Angry people from Sicelo Shiceka squatter camp in Meyerton, Midvaal, have decided to dig deep trenches in roads instead of burning tyres. On Friday, they dug a trench on one of the streets leading past their kasi, saying they had run out of patience in their wait for RDP houses. One resident said: “We keep getting told to be patient while other people get houses. “We are tired of burning tyres on the road. We will protest like this until we’re given attention. “The least they could do is give houses to the elderly. It’s very unpleasant living in a shack, especially for sick people, in the cold weather.” The residents dug the trench after collecting shovels and breaking the surface of the tar road. Meyerton police spokeswoman Constable Maria Letsele said Friday’s incident was not the first time protesters had dug up a road. “They first dug up the road last June and they target the same road every time they protest because it causes such traffic delays. “During their protest over the weekend, traffic was brought to a standstill as motorists couldn’t get through. “Everything was eventually cleared and traffic went back to normal.” Letsele said no one was arrested but she condemned the residents’ actions.
