A CALIFORNIA couple are facing charges of torture and
child abuse after their 10 kids were discovered with injuries and living in
stinking kak in their house. According to The
Guardian, Jonathan Allen (29) and Ina Rogers (31) were today accused of
torturing and abusing their kids, aged between four months and 12 years old. They both deny doing anything wrong. Cops discovered the kids when they responded to a missing
juvenile report and visited the home. They were horrified to discover a house
filled with rotting food and human and animal waste. The 10 kids had puncture
wounds, bruising, and injuries that looked like they had been shot with a pellet
gun. Allen denied the allegations in an interview with KCRA-TV
on Tuesday, saying: “I am not an animal ... The truth is that it is a
functioning household. Everyone helped everyone. It was a complete circle, the
older ones helped the little ones.” Despite the parents’ denial of wrongdoing, the kids’
gogo, Wanda Rogers, called Allen “a monster”. “He would take the baby and slap
it in the face and put duct tape on the baby’s mouth to make it shut up,” she
told KNTV in San Francisco. The parents claimed they home-schooled the kids, but
authorities could find no record of them being registered to do so. Ina Rogers said she worked as a technician at a
heart-monitoring company and her husband was a tattoo artist. A neighbour said he had no idea there were 10 children
living in the house.
