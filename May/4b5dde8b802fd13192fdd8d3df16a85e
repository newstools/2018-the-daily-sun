THE faith of a 23-year-old woman in izinyanga was crushed after her alleged rape. The woman, from Hlathikhulu in Mtshezi in the KZN Midlands, was taken to the inyanga by her aunt after she complained of a stomach ache. According to the woman’s fiance (30), the aunt left the woman alone in the hut with the inyanga for her consultation. “Her aunt said the inyanga asked that she wait for her niece in the car while she prayed for her. When she heard her scream, she said she did not pay attention because she thought maybe she was crying because of pain associated with her stomach,” said the man. He said it was only when his fiancee came out and explained to her aunt what had happened that they went to the police. The man said the police advised that she should be rushed to hospital for clinical proof of the rape. “We did as told but the man has still not been arrested. We don’t know what is delaying it. “We appeal to senior authorities to help with the arrest of the suspect, who is a wolf hiding in a sheep’s clothing,” said the fiance. The worried man said what makes them angry is that the inyanga is still continuing with his life and duties as if nothing happened. The victim told Daily Sun she is still traumatised. “I did not expect this from a person I trusted. “All I want now is for him to pay for what he did to me,” said the shocked woman. Traditional Healers’ Association president Sazi Mhlongo said: “It is very sad when thugs use the name of traditional healers. “There isn’t much we can do except to say that such people deserve to be locked up.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said police are investigating the case but no one has been arrested yet.
