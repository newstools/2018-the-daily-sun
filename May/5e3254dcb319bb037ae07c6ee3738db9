NURSES at Alexandra Clinic in Joburg ran for their lives when men with pangas stormed the emergency department on Saturday night. The gang was after a patient who had been rushed there after a stabbing incident. Nurses were busy stitching up the injured man when the panga gang went for him. They slashed him to death in front of the nurses, who ducked for cover to protect their lives. Captain Mohlaume Mamabolo said a case of murder is being investigated. “A 32-year-old man was stabbed to death. “The motive for the killing is unknown and no arrests have been made yet,” said Mamabolo. Sources said security guards tried to prevent the group from entering but they were overpowered by the heavily armed group. The clinic was closed soon after the incident and only re-opened yesterday. According to the health department, nurses and patients who saw it happen have been taken for counselling to deal with the shocking incident. Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa has condemned the murder. “We are deeply saddened by this senseless killing and appeal to residents to help us protect health facilities, our personnel and patients. “Debriefing and counselling processes are being held to relieve staff and healthcare users from the trauma they suffered during this nightmare. “These kinds of mishaps hinder much needed health services in the community. “Nearby health facilities are already overburdened,” she said. Ramokgopa appealed to residents to help the police find the suspects. “Police have been requested to maintain a high visibility during this period. “The department will ensure measures are taken to strengthen the security services too,” she said.
