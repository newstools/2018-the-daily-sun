RESIDENTS of Simanyene squatter camp in Lwandle, in Strand near Cape Town, may finally be safe from floods. Last month, Daily Sun published a story about how, every time it rained, a family was affected by the canal water that flooded their home. The City is expecting heavy rains this winter, and if the canals are cleared there’ll be less risk of flooding. But the authorities couldn’t clear the canal because vendor stands block the trucks’ way. Mayoral committee member Anda Ntsodo said certain parts of the canal were not accessible. These structures and overhead cables are in their way. Fortunately, after a heated meeting with street vendors on Sunday evening, a decision was taken to temporarily demolish structures to allow cleaning to take place. Resident Noxolo Silala said: “We’re tired of living in a smelly, water-filled place. “When the municipality wants to help us, they can’t due to the people who block the digger’s way. “Without an agreement, we could have been forced to take the matter into our own hands.” A street vendor told Daily Sun: “We want to work with everyone and don’t want to fight. “That’s why I volunteered that they start demolishing my stand first and, after that, we can rebuild and go back to business.” Community leader Mwezi Lugwayi said everyone has rights. “People are living in a waterlogged place and it’s winter now, so this canal must be cleared,” he said. “I’m happy that we’ve reached a decision without a fight.” The structures were marked out that evening so that the municipality could clear the canal.
