WHILE Andile Bhonyonyo lay bleeding to death outside a tavern, patrons were having a good time inside. The 29-year-old from Phahameng kasi in Mangaung was stabbed while queueing for booze outside the local tavern on Sunday. His family is in mourning over the death of their “angel” son, but many residents are celebrating. The dead man allegedly robbed a woman of her cellphone earlier and people say hours later, the boyfriend of the woman came and stabbed him. Residents said Andile had his day coming as he often terrorised the community by robbing them. A witness said: “Andile’s death played out so quickly. A man came in demanding his girlfriend’s cellphone back and even before Andile could respond, the man pulled out a knife. He was a troublemaker but he didn’t deserve to die like that.” Andile’s mother, Nobantu Bhonyonyo (52) said: “I was in bed when I received a phone call to say my child was murdered. When I arrived at the scene he had already been taken to hospital, where he later died. To us Andile was an angel who made us coffee every morning. He wasn’t a troublemaker.” His brother, Andisile Bhonyonyo (25), said: “He was stabbed several times and thrown outside the tavern. Patrons were having the time of their lives while he was dying.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sinah Mpakane confirmed the incident and said a case of murder was opened. “The suspect (25) will appear in court soon.”
