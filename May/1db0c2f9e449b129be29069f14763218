THE City of Johannesburg has received a staggering 35 000
applications for insourcing of security guard positions. Mayor of Joburg Herman Mashaba says this follows his
commitment to insource over 4000 security personnel during his last State of
the City Address. "That's a clear reflection of the desperately high
levels of unemployment faced by our residents, years of government failure and
neglect has left our residents with few prospects for job opportunities and the
hopes of being able to provide for their families," Mashaba said. He said, more so the City continues to do all it can to
create an enabling environment for the creation of economic opportunities. "We have taken numerous steps to ensure that only
qualifying security personnel will benefit from this process," Mashaba said. According to Mashaba on average, the city paid R14 000 per
security guard to security contractors, while the guards themselves received a salary
of only R4100 per month. He said as a City, they remain committed to creating an
inclusive and diverse growing economy that creates job opportunities for
residents.
