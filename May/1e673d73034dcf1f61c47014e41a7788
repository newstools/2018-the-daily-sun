PATIENCE is the virtue! Mamelodi Sundowns winger George Lebese is patiently waiting for his turn to be a regular at the star-studded Brazilian outfit. The former Kaizer Chiefs star is willing to exercise patience as things didn’t go his way in his first season at the Tshwane giants. The 29-year-old said coach, Pitso Mosimane, told him that he is still part of his plans for the 2018-19 Absa Premiership season. Speaking at the launch of the pre-season one-day tournament, Shell Helix Ultra Cup, featuring Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on 21 July, the Pretoria-born footballer said the coach had one-on-one discussion with him about his future. Lebese is positive that Mosimane will look up to him in the Shell tournament while also relishing the prospect of facing his former team. But he is aware breaking into the starting line up at the former African champions will not be easy: “It was disappointing not to play as much as I would have liked this past season. “But the difference is management by the coach. It’s easier to deal with since the coach explained to me why I am not featured. For now I just need to get into the team and play.” Lebese knew that he had to shed some fat to be in the same level as other players. Lebese said: “The first season was a learning curve for me at Sundowns. I didn’t get as many game time as I would have loved to, but I accepted. When I was told to lose weight it came as a surprise because I thought that I was fit enough to play. I was told to lose two to three kilos. I had to cut down on the food and train four times a day.”
