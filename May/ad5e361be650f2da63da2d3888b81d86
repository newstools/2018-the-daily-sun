TSHWANE mayor Solly Msimanga wants people to report foul play relating to the provision of electricity. Msimanga said if municipal inspectors visit houses and see damaged meters that were not reported, fines would be issued to the homeowner. “If the culprits don’t come forward there will be no mercy,” he said. The mayor said the municipality applied for a court order to institute legal action against households with illegal connections. Msimanga warned residents against damaging substations and panels. He said such behaviour delayed the municipality’s efforts to provide electricity. The mayor said poverty does not give people the right to make illegal connections. He said the municipality would conduct clean-up operations in Mamelodi, Soshanguve and Hammanskraal. Some residents said it would be difficult for the municipality to get rid of izinyoka. They said although they knew making illegal connections was wrong, they had no other choice because they couldn’t live without electricity. Resident Abraham Nkambule (46) said the community realises it’s playing a dangerous game. He said: “We are aware of the dangers of izinyoka power because it has killed lots of people and animals in our community. “But there is nothing we can do. “We need electricity and illegal connections are the only way to get it.”
