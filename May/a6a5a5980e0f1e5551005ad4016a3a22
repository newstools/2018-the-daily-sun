HAWAII'S Kilauea volcano destroyed 26 homes and spewed
lava hundreds of feet into the air, leaving evacuated residents unsure how long
they might be displaced. In revised figures on Sunday, Hawaii County officials
said another four unspecified structures were covered by lava. Hawaii officials said the destroyed homes were in the
Leilani Estates subdivision, where molten rock, toxic gas and steam have been
bursting through openings in the ground created by the volcano. Some of the more than 1 700 residents who have been
evacuated were allowed to briefly return to gather medicine, pets, and other
necessities. Officials say residents would be able to do so each day
until further notice as authorities monitor which areas are safe. Amber Makuakane (37), a teacher and single mother of two,
said her three-bedroom house in Leilani Estates was destroyed by lava. The dwelling was across from a fissure that opened on
Friday, when "there was some steam rising from all parts of the yard, but
everything looked fine", Makuakane said. On Saturday, she received alerts from her security system
that motion sensors throughout the house had been triggered. She later
confirmed that lava had covered her property. Makuakane grew up in the area and lived in her house for
nine years. Her parents also live in Leilani Estates. "The volcano and the lava - it's always been a part
of my life," she said. "It's devastating ... but I've come to terms
with it." Lava has spread around 36 000 square metres surrounding
the most active fissure, though the rate of movement is slow. There was no
indication when the lave might stop or how far it might spread. "There's more magma in the system to be erupted. As
long as that supply is there, the eruption will continue," US Geological
Survey volcanologist Wendy Stovall said. Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has
been erupting continuously since 1983.
