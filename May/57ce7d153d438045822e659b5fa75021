Nompumelelo Caluza has been trying for more than five years
to get a birth certificate for her six-year-old daughter at the Home Affairs
Prospecton branch in Isipingo, south of Durban. She told GroundUp that officials have refused to believe
that she gave birth twice in the same year. "On 28 January 2012, I gave birth to my first daughter.
A few weeks after that I fell pregnant again. This time I was blessed with
twins, whom I gave birth to on 6 October 2012," said Caluza. The twins, Lubanzi and Lukhona, were born prematurely and had
to be placed in an incubator. "Unfortunately, Lubanzi died, but Lukhona lived. When
we were discharged from Prince Mshiyeni Hospital, I tried applying for
Lukhona's birth certificate, but the Home Affairs system denied the application
as it picked up that I had given birth in January the same year," said
Caluza. She said she has been in and out of the branch trying to
have the application processed, but officials kept telling her that the system
was rejecting her application. "Right now, my twin daughter is supposed to be in Grade
1, but she is not because a birth certificate is required for registration. I
don't know what else I should do," said Caluza. She has letters from the hospital confirming her admission
for the birth in January and her admission for the premature birth of the
twins, and she has the death certificate for Lubanzi. Spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs in
KwaZulu-Natal, Cyril Mncwabe, said Caluza's complication could be solved. "I will contact the branch and hear what they have to
say regarding the application. I will also call Caluza to get her side of the
story and then I will facilitate the application process. I will make sure that
she is assisted," said Mncwabe. SOURCE: NEWS24
