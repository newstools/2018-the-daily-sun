HIGHWAY rock thrower Nkosinathi Mthalane will spend 10 years in jail! The 27-year-old from Mayville outside Durban was sentenced in the Durban Magistrates Court on Thursday. He was bust in February and charged with malicious damage to property after he was seen throwing rocks at cars on the N3 Berea North bridge. He was initially charged with three counts of malicious damage to property. But the state added four counts of attempted murder because the three damaged cars had passengers in them. In his admission of guilt affidavit, read by his legal aid lawyer Thobile Sigcau, he said he got healed from chest pains after throwing rocks. Sigcau told the court Nkosinathi had pains which went away soon after he had smashed a car. “He said each time he felt pain he would go and smash passing cars and be healed.” Colonel Langa Mhlongo of the Durban organised crime unit and Metro cops senior Superintendent Morgan Subramany told the court the rock throwing cost the state about R35 million in five months. They asked Magistrate Anand Maharaj to give the accused a sentence that would send out a strong message to other rock throwers. They said the incidents, especially the December one in Ballito which claimed two lives, left many people shocked. “The unit had to send 30 members to deal with this new crime trend,” said Mhlongo.
