MUNICIPAL money is apparently being paid to ghost workers. It has been alleged that R177 000 is being paid into an unknown account by the Greater Tubatse-Fetakgomo Municipality in Limpopo every month, and R47 000 is withdrawn from the municipal account. To make matters worse, the municipality has serious problems with water and sanitation and its roads. Municipal authorities have apparently failed to spend R60 million put aside to fast-track service delivery. In response to the allegations, the DA has demanded that the managers responsible be investigated. The party’s Lethabile Kgwedi said they also wrote a letter to Mayor Maudu Phokane, asking him to look into allegations that over R180 000 was spent on tenders that were not properly advertised. The municipality’s finances are in a bad state, as investments were made with the controversial VBS Bank, which has been placed under curatorship. The municipality is said to have invested at least R242 million with the bank. “We want the mayor to contemplate laying criminal charges against section 56 and 57 managers in connection with the illegal withdrawals and debit orders, to hold them accountable for financial mismanagement in the municipality,” said Kgwedi. “The underspending of municipal funds can be directly linked to lack of leadership, poor financial and performance management and poor governance under the section 56 and 57 managers.” Municipal spokesman Thabiso Mokoena said the municipal manager was still looking into the allegations. He said a decision could be made only after the matter was properly investigated.
