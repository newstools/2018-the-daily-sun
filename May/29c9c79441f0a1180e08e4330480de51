MAMELODI Sundowns defender Wayne Arendse did not waste anytime in swapping shirts with Barcelona maestro Lionel Messi. The Spanish giants held their end of the deal in fielding all their star players as Barcelona defeated the Absa Premiership champions 3-1 in a Mandela Centenary Cup match. Messi was the order of the day as the football fanatics chanted his name, they called for him and the little magician eventually obliged as he came on to entertain his fans.  A sense of “Messi” expectancy was everywhere, leading up to this game, and was further seen with wild celebrations when the Argentinian warmed up. Barcelona showed their class as they raced into a 3-0 lead through goals from Ousmane Dembele, Luis Suarez and Andre Gomes. The Brazilians showed character and managed a consolation strike from Sibusiso Vilakazi in the 76th minute. After the final whistle was blown, Arendse swapped shirts with Messi, who was only introduced into the match on the 70th minute to loud cheers from the South African crowd.
