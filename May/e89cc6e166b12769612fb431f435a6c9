“THERE are no guarantees in life. Anything can happen to anyone at any time.” These were the words of Patricia Mukwevho, who woke up one day after having a stroke and was unable to move the right side of her body. The 36-year-old from Musina, Limpopo, said: “I just fell out of bed and was admitted to hospital for three months. “I was in a wheelchair for three years, but I can now walk with a crutch.” Patricia said when she had to use a wheelchair, she often felt ashamed. “I didn’t want to see people and I was always indoors until my sister Rudzani Sebola (50) told me my stroke was a temporary defeat and it would pass,” she said. Patricia, who worked as a cleaner before she had a stroke, said her sister invited her to church to start getting out and it felt good to reconnect with her spiritual side. She said although she had learnt to live with her situation, it was difficult that she couldn’t do certain things anymore. “I was right-handed but now I have to rely on the left side of my body. It took me a year to learn to use my left side properly,” she said. Through the Bona Lesedi Disability Centre, Patricia is training as a mineral publisher with the African Minerals College in Diepsloot, Joburg. She got involved with the centre through its home-based programme, which helps people with disabilities exercise. Her message to other people with disabilities is that it isn’t the end of the world.
