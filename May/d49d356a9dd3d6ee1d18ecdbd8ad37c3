FOR six months criminals have been terrorising residents. Criminals broke into the houses of victims at night and stole their belongings. But the long arm of the law caught up with the two suspects, aged 27 and 41, and they were found in possession of the stolen goods. One of the suspects was arrested at Nkavele Village while the other was arrested in Xikundu Village outside Malamulele, Limpopo. Limpopo police spokesman Moatshe Ngoepe said: “Police arrested a man in Nkavele Village for house breaking.” The suspect took the police to an RDP house at Xikundu to point out the stolen goods. On arrival they searched the house belonging to an older male and DVD players, TV sets, a hybrid mixer, speakers, circuit breakers, cellphones, tablets and amplifiers were found. Ngoepe said both suspects were detained and charged with burglary and possession of suspected stolen properties. They will appear in the Saselamani Magistrates Court tomorrow.
