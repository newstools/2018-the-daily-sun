COSATU in the Western Cape has jumped to the defence of Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille. The federation’s provincial leader Tony Ehrenreich said the DA had used De Lille and now wanted to dump her for no reason. Speaking yesterday, Ehrenreich said: “Cosatu is outraged at the manner in which De Lille is being dealt with through attempts to disgrace her. “It is one thing to no longer want someone as a leader after the DA used her up, but to undermine her as a person is unacceptable.” Ehrenreich said although Cosatu didn’t always agree with De Lille, they would stand with her. “We don’t share De Lille’s desire to defend white privilege in South Africa with the DA but support her right to a fair hearing,” he said. Khayaletisha Development Forum chairman Ndithini Thyido said the DA was removing De Lille because of her promise to do something about the many residents still living in the same areas they were forced to live in during apartheid. He said while the fight between the DA and De Lille continued, the city was left without leadership. Last week, the DA caucus in Cape Town voted in favour of another vote of no confidence in De Lille. The previous one was narrowly defeated. Responding to the news, De Lille said: “I fear no one. “I only fear my God.” The mayor said she has attended 25 community meetings last month and no one said they didn’t like her anymore. “None of the residents I spoke to said they had lost faith in me. “This begs the question whether these councillors who say they have lost confidence in me have ever spoken to their communities,” De Lille said.
