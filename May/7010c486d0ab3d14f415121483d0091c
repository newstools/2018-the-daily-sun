A Twitter spat between musicians Simphiwe Dana and Thandiswa Mazwai over her sister Ntsiki took full flight yesterday. After what was supposed to be the Roast of Somizi quickly turned into the Roast of Ntsiki, many people voiced different opinions on social media Some people felt the controversial poet, Ntsiki, got what was coming to her with the enormous amount of attention she received at the roast but others felt that was not fair. Boni Mbuli described some of the jokes directed at Ntsiki at the roast as “too low.”  Ntsiki’s sister, Thandiswa was also quick to jump to her defence saying “Tsek” to all her sister’s haters. This sparked a mini twar between herself and Simphiwe Dana who feels Ntski brought all the hate on herself by constantly attacking people on Twitter. “Haters that she generated for herself over many years here on Twitter. Don’t bore us. Your sister is a very vile person,” Simphiwe replied to Thandiswa. Thandiswa was not prepared to drag out the mini twar longer than necessary and she deleted most of her Tweets. Simphiwe on the other hand was not having it implying that it is part of Thandiswa’s duty as a sister to call Ntsiki into order when she strays instead of always defending her. Check out the tweets below to see what went down.
