TWIN Plug is made up of Lungile Mncube (28) and Xolani Mbenenge (25) from Meadowlands, Soweto. The kwaito duo hope their new single, titled Bantwana Beskolo, will keep music fans glued to the dance floor. The song commends young people who are determined to succeed. Lungile said: “We are here to motivate pupils to put more effort into their school work, instead of going to parties.” Their passion has opened doors for them. “We signed a deal with Picat Productions,” he said. “We would like to collaborate with award-winning musicians like Alaska, Kwesta, OkmalumKoolKat and Zingah. “They have a great sense of humour. “Our aim is to make music that will take us abroad.” The two have been friends since 2010 and started working together this year. They have just finished working on an album called Back Pack, which they plan to release at the end of the year. They advised up-and-coming musicians to pray and believe in God.
