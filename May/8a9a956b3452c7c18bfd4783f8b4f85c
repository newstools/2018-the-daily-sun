THREE commuters died and 22 were injured in two taxi accidents that took place in Cape Town at the weekend. On Sunday a taxi that was travelling from Khayelitsha to Parow was involved in an accident on the R300. A witness said:“It looked like a movie. “The force of the collision hurled passengers out of the taxi.” Three of the 18 passengers died at the scene while 15 were rushed to hospital. According to witnesses, the accident was caused by a Toyota Avanza that drove in front of the minibus taxi. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a culpable homicide case has been opened. “All the injured people were taken to medical facilities,” said Rwexana. Passenger Mphumzi Duna (27), who escape unharmed, said he is grateful to be alive. “I thank God and my ancestors for saving me because people were badly injured. But I was not harmed,” he said. Passenger Mandisa Sigonyela (28) said she had no idea what caused the accident. “Everything was fine until the taxi started rolling,” said Mandisa. According to another passenger, the taxi was travelling too fast. She said the accident was caused by their driver’s attempts to overtake another vehicle. “He was doing what most drivers do, which is travelling at a high speed. “We are just glad no one died, even though some were badly injured,” said the passenger. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said he did not have any information about the incident.
