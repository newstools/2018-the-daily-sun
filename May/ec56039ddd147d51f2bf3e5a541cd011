Popular rapper, Solo and his digital Hip-Hop band, The Betr Gang have announced a surprise EP, due for digital release on 08 June 2018. After a successful, eight-week residency at Agog in Maboneng, Jozi, the band announced that their new EP would be titled des DATES de TOURNEE (Tour Dates - France Edition), which is the 3rd offering from the band. The EP will consist of 5 tracks and comes after the release of their Tour Dates album in January 2018 with 14 phenomenal features. The band also revealed the inspiration behind the EP’s artwork which takes its ‘expressionist’ influence from the original art piece by renowned French artist, Edgar Degas (1834-1917). Solo and The BETR Gang have adapted an original art piece titled ‘La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans’ (translated; Little Dancer of Fourteen Years) by the famous artist. “The ‘Little Dancer of Fourteen Years’ was quite a controversial piece, as many people’s views on the sculpture were unfavourable. Many believed it lacked conventional beauty, was ugly and depraved. This piece became the base on how this project was threaded,” said lead member, Solo.
