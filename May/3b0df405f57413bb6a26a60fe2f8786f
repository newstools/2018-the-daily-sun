WHEN Jacob Modithe and his family bought a new home, they thought life would improve. But after two months of living in their new three-roomed house, things started going from bad to worse. Every morning when the 37-year-old from Snake Park kasi in Kroonstad wakes up, he finds a dead rat in front of his door. A sangoma told the worried man someone wanted him dead. “After buying a new house, I thought life would be better but instead I have to sleep with one eye open to look out for the evil rats! “Three weeks after moving into the new home with my girlfriend, I started noticing my groceries were going missing. “I thought it was just my imagination but one afternoon when I came home early from work, I saw two rats the size of kittens on top of my table, eating rice. “I closed the door after going out. “I’m not afraid of rats but those I saw looked intimidating, with red-hot eyes. “That day, I had to ask a friend to sleep over at his house. “What is strange is every morning I find one lying dead in front of my door. “I thought of poisoning them so they die but it seems they gain weight and die by themselves. I have even set traps but nothing works. “Before I went to sangomas, I thought I should just give them a week and they might all die. “I went to four sangomas, who gave me muthi to sprinkle in the house but nothing seems to work. “I was even told that a jealous person wants to see me moving out, or dead and eaten by the evil rats. “ I need help from anyone who can help me get rid of these rats,” Jacob said. Sangoma Mamoya Rakauoane said: “This is a sign that someone is at war with them. If they don’t get help fast, someone could end up dead. “A strong prophet needs to cleanse their yard,” Mamoya said.
