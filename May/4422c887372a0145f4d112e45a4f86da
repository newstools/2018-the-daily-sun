Singer Lungi Naidoo knows firsthand what it's like to be the victim of abuse and she sympathizes with Gqom queen Babes Wodumo, who it has been revealed was a victim of domestic violence. The Kiss Madolo hitmaker who is normally very guarded when it comes to her private life said Babes’ story inspired her to share a part of her life she normally wouldn’t. “I was a victim of physical and emotional abuse,” Lungi admits, “I know what it feels like to be beaten and humiliated, to cry out silently because you don’t want to seem weak. “I believed that it was my fault and that I had to change to make him happy. So I changed my entire outlook at life so he could be happy. “This continued for a while until one day after I had left him, he beat me up on the street. I reported it & ran for my life. My family didn’t know,” she wrote. Metro FM’s Masechaba Ndlovu has come under fire on social media for the manner in which she aired Babes’ abuse with some calling it “insensitive.”  However, Lungi believes what Masechaba did “freed Babes” and gave other people like herself courage to share their stories.
