Mzansi's internationally-renowned DJ posted a picture of himself on Instagram with a jet that has his name on it on Thursday. This left many people thinking that he had bought himself a private jet. The jet is branded “Black Coffee”, with a Mzansi flag underneath his name. LEVELS: BLACK COFFEE MIGHT HAVE A PRIVATE JET! The DJ also started receiving congratulatory messages congratulations on social media. But on Friday, Black Coffee tweeted  that he has not bought an aircraft but is actually renting it. He tweeted: Satafrika ..Thanks for all the Congratulations but NO I didn't buy a Jet I'm renting it for the Summer." In another Tweet he wrote: "I will..one day....it's not my next goal.1st I need to help create a real working business model for Artists and our Music Industry then build a School with my Brothers @LadumaNgxokolo and @nelsonmakamo That's my true dream."  His caption on the first tweet read: “The European/US Summer is beginning and I’m so excited and grateful to be able to travel the World, share Music, Joy and Love, one day at a time. “I’ve been pursuing my dream to make, play music and to share it with people of all religions, races, colour or creed all over the World. “My feeling has always been that Love has no boundaries, no borders. “This is what drives me and will always be. I’m so proud of my country & my people for the Roots, Love and Ubuntu. Let spread the Love. See you in your City...The journey continues.”
