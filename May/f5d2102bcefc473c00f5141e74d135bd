THE Limpopo Health Department may be in hot water after the death of Granny Madikwe in hospital. Granny (48) was kept in Mokopane Hospital for three weeks without being operated on after she was admitted with a broken leg and hip fracture. She had been hit by a car. The People’s Paper published her story last month after she was admitted but allegedly not given any help. Granny died last week, two days after finally undergoing surgery. The health ombudsman is now investigating the circumstances surrounding her death. Langa Bodlani, DA member of the provincial legislature, said: “During our oversight investigations, as part of the hospital health check, we discovered negligence. It’s unbelievable that a leg fracture could lead to the death of a patient. “Granny’s family has confirmed to us that she had no other ailment. The investigation by the health ombudsman, without pre-empting its findings, is a confirmation to us that the department has a lot to answer for on this matter.” Neil Shikwambane, a spokesman for the health department, said they were also saddened by the death of the patient. “While Granny was in hospital she was being treated for venous ulcers, which caused blood pools in her legs and sores. “This led to the delay in the hospital operating on her. “Her chance for surgery came and she was operated on,” said Shikwambane. “We think we have done everything possible and I do not understand the negligence charge levelled against us. “There is no report of recklessness from our side. She was seen by doctors and nurses while awaiting the operation, and she looked fine,” said Shikwambane. He said the department would co-operate with the health ombudsman’s investigation and accept any recommendations it made.
