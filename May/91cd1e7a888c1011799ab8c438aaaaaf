THEY allegedly blew the whistle on teachers allegedly loading milk, rice and canned food meant for the feeding scheme into their cars. Now three cooks from Madingoane Primary School in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni claim they are being victimised for telling the truth. They said they were given termination letters to stop working at the school because they didn’t have children there. Daily Sun has a copy of a letter from the Ekurhuleni East district instructing the school to reinstate them because they have contracts until April next year, but the school refuses to allow them to work. “We feel as if we’re standing in the way of the people who are looting food meant for children,” said one of the cooks, Magauta Motloung. “It’s a shame that the people who are doing this are getting salaries,” said Motloung. Steve Mabona of the Gauteng Education spokesman said there were allegations of theft of food at the school. “Officials went to the school on Friday to talk to those involved.”
