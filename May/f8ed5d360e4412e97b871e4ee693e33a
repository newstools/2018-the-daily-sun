HOME Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba launched the all new
Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS), on Wednesday morning in Cape
Town. He says the system will integrate systems inside and outside
government, in order to offer a single biometric authentication for citizens. Gigaba said the ABIS will hugely change the way in which
South Africans are identified. According to Gigaba it will be the back-bone of how the
public and private sector will manage the verification of clients. "This modern IT system will integrate with other
relevant systems, inside and outside Home Affairs, to allow for one holistic
view of the status of the clients. "It will serve as a single source for biometric authentication
of citizens and non-citizens across state institutions and private sector
clients," he said. The ABIS project was initiated in January 2016 with an aim
to replace the Home Affairs National Identity System (HANIS), which is manually
operated and out-dated. He said HANIS, faced imminent collapse of the over 20
year-old biometrics database, which left the department with no choice but to
conduct a technology upgrade. The ABIS project will be rolled-out in phases, over a five
year period. The system will reportedly lead to a faster turn-around time
for people applying for ID documents, passports, reduced cases of duplicate
identities.
