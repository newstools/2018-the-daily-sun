ON Wednesday, Human Settlements Minister Nomaindiya Mfeketo urged new housing beneficiaries in Delft, Cape Town not to sell their houses. Western Cape MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela hosted the minister and MECs from different provinces at the handover of ten houses and over 1 000 title deeds. “Government should ensure the necessary services are available to the people,” said Madikizela. The minister stressed that a title deed is the only legal document proving house ownership. “Take care of these houses. You aren’t allowed to sell them.” She said if beneficiaries have problems with their houses, they must let the department know. “There is only one house for each person, so if we give you a house now, we will never give you a second one.” Bongiswa Mbebe (34) was happy to finally get a safe place to live with her disabled daughter Okuhle, saying they used to share a structure with 10 other people. Nolungelo Dlakiya (55) was happy to finally get her title deed. “Since I didn’t have one, I was afraid I wouldn’t have anything to prove the house was mine,” she said. Councillor Brett Herron told beneficiaries to make wills so when they die, there are no fights over houses.
