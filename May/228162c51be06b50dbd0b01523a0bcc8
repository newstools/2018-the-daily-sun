KZN supporters of President Cyril Ramaphosa have vowed to make the province ungovernable if the NEC doesn’t disband the provincial task team immediately. Branches from eThekwini, the Moses Mabhida region in Pietermaritzburg, the Harry Gwala region of Ixopo and the Lower South Coast region in Port Shepstone gathered at Curries Fountain in Durban yesterday. Howard Msomi, a leader from Lower South Coast, said the task team was useless. “It has failed to resolve the problems because it wanted its factional branches to go to the conference. We are calling on the NEC to take over or we will make this province ungovernable,” he said. Siyabonga Hlongwa from Moses Mabhida said 14 comrades from his region had been killed. He said it was surprising that the NEC had not declared it a disaster area. How many people needed to die before party leaders listened to branches, he asked. “When things suit them, they say power is with the branches but when we call them to listen to us, they don’t come,” Speaking on behalf of the eThekwini branches, Sithenjwa Nyawose said there would be no conference without them. He said although many branches from his region were being removed from the party roll, the task team wanted to go ahead with the elective conference. Task team member Super Zuma said he hoped they would be able to resolve all the problems before the conference next week.
