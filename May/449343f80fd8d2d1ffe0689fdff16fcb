IT’S the main tourist attraction of Makause squatter camp in Germiston, Ekurhuleni. The four-storey mkhukhu with a view is on the busy main road, and is easy for people to notice. Even from the outside, you can see it’s different. It has plants growing from top to bottom. It has tyre decorations and it’s high! The mkhukhu has a place where kids’ birthdays are held, braai areas for those who want to come inside to chill, and a drinking lounge. Owner Joe Phala (58) even has direction boards outside to show what visitors can expect inside. Joe said he has been building his shack for two years now. “Some residents love it because it’s putting our squatter camp on the map,” said the proud owner. “People stop and come inside to see it. Mlungus often come to drink here.” He said in the beginning people thought he was crazy. “Some even told me my shack was going to be blown away by a hurricane. But it’s getting stronger and stronger and nothing has happened to it. “I make sure that the floor is strong so people don’t fall through. The foundation is strong and there’s no way it’s going to collapse.” Joe has eight tenants. He said thugs shouldn’t watch out for a dog but should be scared of the owner. Tenant, Portia Mboweni said they sleep peacefully at night knowing nothing will happen to them. Neighbour Gideon Hlophe said: “I have been inside. You can see every mkhukhu in the squatter camp.”
