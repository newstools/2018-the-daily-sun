Fomer super model turned businesswoman and socialite Babalwa Mneno, has dispelled allegations that she is a “Pimp.” This is after it was alleged on social media over the weekend that Mneno is part of the group of women who prostitute young girls to richer men for cash. The allegations made on Twitter go on to indicate that Mneno, who is also a club hostess, uses her role at these clubs to sell these young girls to rich older men. But in her defence, the BlackBarbielish as she calls herself, said she’s “never pimped a fly,” let alone a whole human being.  In fact she claims if anything, she is the one who exposes the young girls who approach her looking to make quick cash.
