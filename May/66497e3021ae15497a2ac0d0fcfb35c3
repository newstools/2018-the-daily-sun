A SEASON ago Golden Arrows midfielder Nduduzo Sibiya was a hot property, scooping the Nedbank Cup Young Player of the Tournament award and also receiving his maiden Bafana Bafana call-up. His sterling season also saw him score memorable goal that knocked Mamelodi Sundowns out of the Ke Yona cup and was admired by Downs coach Pitso Mosimane. The 22-year-old continued with his stealer form at Bafana when they played in the Cosafa Cup that was held in North West last year, and was named man of the match against Namibia in the Plate final. However, the knee injury he sustained in that tournament saw him miss the entire Arrows pre-season training and that’s where all fell apart for him. The Lamontville-born said that injury and a groin he sustained in November are the main reasons why he was a shadow his former self in the 2016-17. Said Sibiya: “People can talk all they want, but everyone close to me knew what went wrong this season. Firstly I didn’t have a pre-season with the club due to a knee injury. Secondly, my fitness was never the same when I came back. When I thought I have regained my fitness and getting in shape, then I was hit with another injury (groin) then my season was disrupted again.” The skilful player gave glimpses of his former self when he featured in the club’s Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC) team that won the championship. He denied however that he was demoted to the MDC because of ill-disciplined, and lost focus after being linked with a move to Sundowns. He explains: “I’m always grounded. As I speak right now, I can’t wait for pre-season. I’m in a good shape and I have shaken off my groin injury. I really can’t wait for the start of the new season and show people what I’m really made of. “But the important thing is that I want to help my team achieve better things next season. Also I want to see myself back in the Bafana fold.”
