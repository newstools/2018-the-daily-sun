A FORMER police officer, Phumzile Ng-qayimbana (41), and hitman Siyamcela Ntshitshi (33) were both found guilty of murder on Friday. The Mthatha High Court found them guilty of killing Elliotdale station commander Lieutenant-Colonel Nomalizo Dukumbana (53) at the police barracks in December 2013. Phumzile and Siyamcela were further found guilty of unlawful possession of firearms with intent to commit an offence, and unlawful possession of ammunition. The third accused, Phumzile’s brother Mbuyiselo, was found not guilty on all charges while the fourth suspect, Sipho Makhabeni, was not prosecuted as he turned state witness. Phumzile’s girlfriend Noxolo Matya was earlier sentenced to life in prison after she confessed to conspiracy to commit murder. In his judgment, Judge Zamani Nhlangulela said the court did not find the evidence produced by the accused convincing, due to the fact that it went against overwhelming evidence from state witnesses. “Sipho testified that he and Siyamcela made an attempt to kill the deceased at her home in Corana, but failed due to some hurdles,” said the judge. He said Sipho confirmed they went to Elliotdale on 17 December to see the barracks and the victim to make sure the attack later in the night was a success. The judge said in proving the case, the state called three of the accused’s work colleagues, who said Phumzile had made threats against Dukumbana in a labour dispute. Sipho testified that Phumzile had paid him and Siyamcela only R1 500 instead of the R10 000 they had agreed to. Sentencing was postponed to 11 June.
