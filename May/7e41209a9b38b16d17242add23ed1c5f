ARTS and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa launched Africa Month at Artscape Theatre in Cape Town on Wednesday. Western Cape Cultural Affairs MEC Anroux Marais, Artscape CEO Marlene le Roux and director Thoko Ntshinga attended the launch. He said the theme of this year’s, Africa Month will be “The Year of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela: Building a Better Africa and a Better World”. Mthethwa spoke about the effects of colonialism and how Africans came together to fight it. “It’s been 55 years since African nations came together to form a united front against the colonial powers that looted the continent for years. “The actions of the colonisers left scores of people desperate,” said the minister. Le Roux said it is important for Africans to know their roots. “Because of apartheid, we were fed information that made us believe Africans are not valuable. “Africans need to know who they are,” said Le Roux. Mthethwa said although most African countries won the fight for independence, the division caused by years of colonial rule still exists. He said unity is the key to Africa’s success. “Today, African nations across the continent enjoy their independence but the legacy of colonialism lives on. “The key message of the 21st century is that Africa needs to strengthen unity among its nations and collaborate to rebuild itself.”
