A councillor gave birth just hours after her house was petrol bombed while she and her family were inside. When Daily Sun spoke to Ward 3 Councillor Khosi Mogapi from Kagisho square in Mangaung on Tuesday, she told the People’s Paper she had felt some labour pains from the shock. Later that day Mogapi gave birth to a baby girl, her fourth child. She told Daily Sun she suspected her attackers were people who were unhappy during a community meeting on 26 March about who should be hired for a paving project in their kasi. “It was in the early hours of Monday morning when I heard footsteps in my yard. “I opened the curtain and saw three men in the yard. One of them was holding a lit petrol bomb. “He threw it at the kitchen door and flames were everywhere. I was terrified and fell down but then I got up and grabbed my kids and ran.” She thanked the community members who helped to put out the fire. “God was with me at that time because what if I hadn’t seen them? My whole family would be dead. My husband tried to chase them but had no luck,” she told Daily Sun. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said a case of malicious damage to property was opened. “A suspect (42) was arrested,” said Hlubi.
