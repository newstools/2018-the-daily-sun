A few wide-eyed youngsters fixed their gaze on Lebohang Manyama as he conducted the draw for the Maimane Alfred Phiri Games (MAP) in Alexandra, Joburg, last night. The budding football professionals are hoping to follow in Manyama’s footsteps. It all started here for Manyama, who scooped major PSL awards last season, before securing a dream move overseas. “I’m what I am because of this tournament and I’m always honoured to still be here, involved every year. “That is why I’m pledging to personally sponsor all the individual prize categories for best coaches. I appreciate what they do for all the youngsters,” said Manyama. For 17 years, Maimane Phiri, the founder of the tournament, has been staging the games with scarce resources. He admits it hasn’t been an easy journey. But he looks back with pride at the great history of the tournament, which has grown in leaps and bounds. Cellular giants MTN and pay tv channel, SuperSport, have also come on board. For the first time, the games will be shown live on television. “Despite the many challenges, we have persevered as the foundation,” said Phiri. “I’m happy that other sponsors have come on board and our long terms partners are still with us, Boston College, Gauteng Gambling Board, City of Joburg and provincial sports and recreation.” MTN regional manager Ramsey Mosethedi said: “The MAP games resonates with the ethos and values of MTN, of eradication of gender-base violence and racism in all forms and shape.” Over 160 teams take part in the tourney over a period of three weeks, starting this weekend and ending on 16 June. Teams such as Black Poison, Phomolong All Stars, Blue Aces, Alex Royal Tigers, Happy Birds, Real Midrand, Shai XI and defending champions, Catalonia, were among the teams drawn in the junior teams category. The tournament has discovered reknown stars such as Simphiwe Tshabalala, Mpho Makola, Bongani Zungu, Patrick Phungwayo and Joseph Molangoane.
