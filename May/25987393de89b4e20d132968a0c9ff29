THE national bus drivers strike marks 15 days since over 17 000 drivers
downed tools. In the past 2 weeks, the taxi industry has tried to absorb the stranded
bus commuters but have been battling, as there are huge queues at taxi ranks in
the mornings. The employers have offered 9% for the first year over 11 months and 8%
on the second year. However, the workers want 9,5% for the first year over 12 months and
8,5% for the second year. Commuters have been forced to use taxis, adding to the already crowded
taxi queues. The hardest hit are said to be those with monthly bus tags. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande and Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant
were briefed by parties on their bargaining positions last week Thursday, but
their contributions failed to resolve the strike.
