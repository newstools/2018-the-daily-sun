SOUTH African Municipal Workers’ Union workers want their money and forced it to the top of the agenda at the King Sabatha Dalindyebo Municipality council meeting. The workers stormed into an ordinary council meeting at the Nkululekweni council chambers in Mthatha, singing songs and demanding their money and the removal of corporate service director, Ayanda Mdleleni. Samwu provincial treasurer Sithiwe Mali said workers have not been paid their task grade money for which they have been fighting since 2009. “We were shocked to hear that workers are paid at transitional local council grades while some of managers earned by task, yet they didn’t want it implemented for workers,” said Mali. “We want that to be on top of the agenda. We want the money in our accounts. “We will mobilise structures, including residents. Service delivery will stand still until the workers get their money.” The workers were seen camping out at the town hall, not working, while the gates of the offices were locked. Mabandla Gogo of the United Democratic Movement said the disruption was justified. “Mdleleni has abused his powers and is being protected by Dumani Zozo. “They must go. The people are suffering.There should be rolling action until Zozo steps down,” said Gogo. The DA’s Raymond Knock said: “The people are fighting for their rights. “This task thing is for the director’s desk. He is the one who should be making sure implementation takes place. There should be consequences for management.” Municipal spokesman Sonwabo Mampoza said talks were being held between the municipality’s leaders and Samwu and that the municipality was trying to meet the deadline set to ensure that some of their demands were met. “The issue of the director is on the table,” he added. “We cannot just blame the leadership. There were technicalities that caused the delay up to this time.”
