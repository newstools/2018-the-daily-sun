COPS have been assigned to keep guard around the clock at Mooi River Toll Plaza until July. KZN Premier Willies Mchunu announced this during his budget speech in Pietermaritzburg yesterday. Mchunu said transport and safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda agreed to this. “Police will keep guard at the plaza day and night until the situation with the truck companies is resolved. “We were very disturbed by the latest incident and will make sure it doesn’t happen again.” On Sunday, about 35 trucks were torched and 56 people were arrested for the incident. But only eight were charged, while charges against the other 48 were dropped due to lack of evidence. Mchunu said he will discuss the Mooi River issue in his meeting with trucking companies. Police Minister Bheki Cele, Labour Minister Mildred Olifant and Transport Minister Blade Nzimande are also expected at the meeting. When Daily Sun asked the premier about police crime intelligence, he said the incident was picked up before it happened. “They expected it to take place on Tuesday on Worker’s Day. “But thugs acted on Sunday, which was why police couldn’t prevent it,” said Mchunu. He said residents succeeded in their actions because cops guarding the plaza were withdrawn after it was thought it was safe to do so. Mchunu said truck drivers distanced themselves from the burning of trucks when they met Kaunda. “They raised their grievances over companies employing foreign drivers. “I found out those grievances were genuine but burning trucks is just not acceptable.” He said companies were allowed to employ foreigners within the law and said government has the responsibility to protect foreigners from being exploited.
