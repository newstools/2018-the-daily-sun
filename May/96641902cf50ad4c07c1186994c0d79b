PLATINUM Stars’ hopes of holding on to their Absa Premiership status could go up in smoke should they lose to Black Leopards in their third promotion/relegation play-offs match on Saturday night. Dikwena are yet to win a match since the play-offs started last week, a sign that Roger de Sa’s side deserved to be relegated to the National First Division (NFD). They have not even come close to scoring in their two matches where they lost to Leopards and drew 0-0 with Cosmos. Moruleng Stadium on Saturday night (8.15pm) will present them with their final chance to redeem themselves. A loss will confirm their exit to the NFD to follow Ajax Cape Town who got dropped controversially, and Stars came on as a replacement. Stars loss would mean Leopards have one foot in the Premiership, as they will sit in a comfortable position with seven points, from three matches. Currently Leopards are leading the three team log with four points, followed by Jomo Cosmos with two and Stars have a mere point, which will be meaningless if they lose tomorrow. All the teams have played two games, and they have two remaining. In a worded media release yesterday, De Sa told his supporters that they have not thrown in the towel yet. “All we can do is give it a go and win against Leopards to stay in it,” said De Sa. “Seven points is usually the amount that takes you through. We have got to win them both. There’s no other calculation that can do it for us.” Cosmos have also dug themselves deeper into the hole having played two draws against Leopards and Stars.
