Faith Nketsi, better known as Queen Twerk, is currently on a fabulous Asian vacation. The famous Instagram ‘baddie’ is in Hong Kong with her friend and fellow Instagram baddie, Tebogo Thobejane. And judging by the fact that they’re always in the same pictures, we suspect that someone else is accompanying them on this trip. Faith has been sharing snaps of their trip on Instagram this week, including their trip to Disneyland and their shopping sprees at luxury brands like Gucci. And what is a vacation without a sexy bikini shoot? The pro-twerker has also been lounging around her hotel’s pool deck in a sexy, white, two-piece bikini that shows off the dancer’s famous body. They have also paid a visit to the legendary Japanese restaurant, bar and lounge that also has private dining facilities, Zuma. Check out the pics below: In the streets of ????
