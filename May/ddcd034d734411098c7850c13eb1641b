A PASTOR has been charged with allegedly killing his
lover, cutting off her head and arms before burying her in his church. According to Punch,
Tobiloba Ipense, the founder of Holy Garden Ministry Zion C and S Church, was
today taken into custody after a hearing at the Ifoo Magistrates’ Court in Ogun
State, Nigeria. On 21 March, Raliat Sanni, a divorced mum of five, didn’t
return home after going to Ipense’s church. Raliat’s brother, Adebola Saheed,
raised the alarm with the cops. Ipense was picked up and interrogated by cops a few days
later. He allegedly confessed to killing Raliat and burying her in his church
after cutting off her head and arms. Cops exhumed Raliat’s mutilated body from a room close to
the church altar. It seems that Ipense later denied killing Sanni, claiming
that his co-pastor, David Sopeju, was responsible for her death. Sopeju denies being involved, but a woman called Oluwakemi
Ishola has been charged alongside Ipense  on three counts of murder and possession of
human parts. Ishola was released on bail, while Ipense remains in
prison until the next court hearing on 27 July.
