The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) says it
will not be commemorating this Workers' Day this year. Instead the union is campaigning for Workers' Day to be moved to a date
that it says is "more emblematic" of South Africa's working class
struggle - the Marikana massacre on August 16. On August 16, 2012, police opened fire on a crowd of striking miners at
Marikana in the North West.Â  Thirty-four
mineworkers were killed, and 78 seriously injured. "As a trade union we hold the Lonmin [Marikana] massacre in the
same logical plane as the Soweto Uprising and the Sharpeville Massacres, just
mention a few; which have managed to symbolise the youth and human rights
struggles of our Country," AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa said. "It is this symbolism that gives meaning and relevance, within
context, to a public holiday for whatever purpose." Minimum wage battle International Workers' Day is celebrated globally on May 1 every year
after 300 000 workers in the US left their workplaces to demand an eight hour
working day, Mathunjwa said. However, the day has been adapted to celebrate various struggles in
different contexts in different countries. "Suffice to mention, there have been different standards
internationally in determining the workers day with some countries using the
first Monday of May while other countries such as the USA celebrate this day on
the first Monday of September," he said. "This goes on to show therefore that there is no static symbolism
attached to the 1 May date, which can overridden by peculiar circumstances that
are definitive of a country's history, giving rationale to the choice of a
specific date for the recognition and celebration of Workers' Day." Mathunjwa also referred to the heated minimum wage battle, which he
points out has been elevated to national debate on "the backdrop of
struggles incarnated by August 16 Massacre". SOURCE: NEWS24
