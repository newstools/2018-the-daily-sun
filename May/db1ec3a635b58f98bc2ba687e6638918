LIBOKO Mofubetsoana always knew she was different. The 27-year-old from section E in Botshabelo, Free State, said while growing up she realised she was not like other boys. “I felt trapped in a man’s body and was very unhappy,” she said. Liboko said a few years ago, she learnt of a treatment to help her become a fully developed woman. “I started it in 2016, which involved taking hormones,” she said. “My parents were supportive, which helped a lot.” With the help of the treatment she started to grow real breasts. “People who’d last seen me as a boy were surprised at the developments and wanted to know how I did it.” She said at first she didn’t want to open up. “Now that I’m comfortable in my own skin, I no longer get embarrassed,” she said. “The treatment is going very well, but it doesn’t come cheap. “I’m grateful to have followed my heart. “Every person has a right to be who they want to be.” The radio drama actress and events organiser said she is now a well-known beauty queen in her area, having won 10 pageants. Liboko said undergoing the treatment wasn’t easy at first. “There were serious side effects, but I was determined to make it work,” she said. “I’m so happy I never stopped. I began to see the results when my beard stopped growing. “My voice became softer and my skin was flawless.” Liboko said her wish is one day to have her own baby. “I’ll use a surrogate mother. I truly believe I will make a good mum.”
