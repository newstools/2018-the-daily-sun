The tense situation between Kwaito star, Nomasonto ‘Mshoza’ Maswanganyi and her husband, Thuthukani Mvula is getting more and more intense by the day. Last week, we reported that Mshoza had called things off with her husband after allegedly finding proof of his infidelity. This came after Mshoza went onto her Facebook page and said: “I told you ages ago I’d catch you cheating and dump you. I’ve been watching you and can’t take this anymore”. ICYMI: MSHOZA DUMPS HER MAN Thuthukani then hit back at Mshoza’s accusations, telling Daily Sun that in fact, she is the cheater. He then went on to further embarrass her by turning her clothes into a bonfire. It has since emerged that Mshoza has not only fled their home in fear that he might harm her but that she is now under 24-hour protection.

I think it is all hitting her now, the impact of what happened, and so the best place for her right now is under 24-hour protection,” Mshoza's manager, Thanduxolo Jindela told TshisaLIVE. Mshoza’s manager also revealed to the publication that Mshoza has opened a case of “assault, intimidation and pointing a firearm” against her husband. ANGRY HUSBAND SETS MSHOZA'S CLOTHES ON FIRE!
