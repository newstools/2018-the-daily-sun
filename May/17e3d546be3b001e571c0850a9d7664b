A MEETING over a piece of land turned into a war of words between residents and ward committee members. It was held at the Steve Tshwete municipal chambers on Thursday. According to residents, a piece of land in Mhluzi extension 8, Mpumalanga was identified and applied for in 2013 to build a skills development centre. Joe Ngubeni, a community representative, said: “The municipality chose to ignore our plea to bring development to the area and decided to sell the land to some church people. “We have written several letters to the municipality, but we were surprised to hear that the land was sold to people who wanted to build a church on it. “We wanted to change the lives of residents, including people living with disabilities, but it seems our municipality doesn’t care.” Another resident said their councillor was failing them. “Our councillor doesn’t even support the ideas we raise. Instead, every time there’s a meeting, the councillor and ward committee members bully us about the matters we raise. “We want to warn the municipality that we will do everything in our power to stop the church being built.” She said the area has enough churches and the land should have been given to the residents. Councillor Michael Mbatiwe said church people bought the land after it was advertised in the newspapers by the municipality in December last year. Municipal spokeswoman Prudence Magutle said: “The municipality informed the community about the division of the land in question through local newspapers, council notice boards and the website.” “The church acquired the land from the municipality legally. Residents are urged to refrain from interfering with the building of the church because they will be dealt with legally.”
