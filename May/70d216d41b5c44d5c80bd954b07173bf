SHE shut the gate in the faces of her late husband’s kids but that gate was the first thing removed when the makoti was evicted after the funeral. Tensions were high on Sunday in Meadowlands, Soweto when members of the Moyo family kicked their father’s wife out. She had refused to let them into the family home to mourn his death. The community and some EFF members decided to help the family after Daily Sun published a story on Wednesday with a photo of the Moyos mourning outside. They told the SunTeam they had been evicted by their father’s wife. An uncle from Swaziland said: “This woman was not married to my brother. She and her daughter physically abused my brother until he died.” Makoti Pinki Moyo (62) said the uncle was lying. “Your brother paid lobola for me in 1974 and my mother-in-law asked me to stay here. I looked after her until she died,” she said. When Pinki was asked to produce documents proving she was legally married to her late husband and owned the house, she disappeared into her bedroom for almost 30 minutes. EFF members became impatient and started moving her belongings out of the house. Smangele Moyo (31) said the family was grateful to the EFF and the community for helping.
