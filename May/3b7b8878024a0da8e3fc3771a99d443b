It seems like that moemish moment courtesy of UDM leader, Bantu Holomisa hosting an eNCA show is the gift that keeps on giving. After being at the center of social media jokes in Mzansi for over a week now, Bantu’s blunder is going global. The now viral video of the politician taking on the role of news anchor and then failing to read the autocue has everyone in stiches, including international music icon, Snoop Dogg. Snoop shared the video on his Instagram page earlier this week. “Back to school night Comin soon,” Snoop captioned the video. Meanwhile, the video has been viewed over 800 000 times on Snoop’s Insta by the likes of Lupita Nyongo’.
