FOR many years residents had been pleading for the 5km gravel road that connects their village to the R81 to be tarred. And they were delighted last year when they were told about a roads project that would happen in various phases. It appears it’s finally happening, except it’s not what they had hoped for. The road is paved, instead of being tarred. Resident Mantibu Motjieng (23) said they wanted a tarred road, not a paved one, because paving requires frequent maintenance. Municipal spokeswoman Lovers Maenetje said they’d already completed three such projects. “The project will see villagers having easy access to their homes,” she said. The paved road will connect the existing tarred road with the Sekgopo Traditional Council offices in Ga-Sekgopo Village, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo. Resident Phadishi Ramaremo (28) said “Our relatives were reluctant to visit us because of the poor condition of the road.” Apparently, even traders would refuse to set foot here, let alone do business in the village. Maenetje said the municipality’s paving budget this year is valued at more than R7 million. The project is 83% complete.
