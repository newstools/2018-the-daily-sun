A 30-year-old man was arrested for faking a hijacking in Bluewater
Bay in Port Elizabeth. He was arrested for making a false statement under oath and theft, the cops said. Cops spokesperson Col Priscilla Naidu said on 12 May, the
suspect alleged that at about 03:30, he was hijacked at gunpoint by unknown
males on the N2 Freeway near Bluewater Bay. The suspect was the driver of a truck that was loaded with
liquor to the value of R800 000. After cops made further investigations, allegedly came out
with the truth and said he was not robbed, but instead agreed with the unknown
men to steal the liquor. He appeared in the Motherwell Magistratesâ€™ Court and was
released on R500 bail, but the case was remanded until 2 July. The opening of false cases is an offence and is punishable
by law and will therefore not be tolerated by the South African Police Service,"
Col Priscilla Naidu said. "We will not hesitate to arrest and detain those who open
false cases. The cases opened are very serious allegations and require
intensive investigation which entail long hours, manpower and resources," Motherwell
Cluster Cluster Commander Major General Dawie Rabie said.
