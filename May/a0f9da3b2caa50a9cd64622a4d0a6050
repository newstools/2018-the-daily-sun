UNIONS representing cash-in-transit van drivers will meet
with employers in the sector in Johannesburg on Wednesday. They will be meeting to discuss the ongoing crisis of cash-in-transit heists. This after numerous cash-in-transit heists were witnessed in
the country over the past couple of months. The Federation of Unions of South Africa (FEDUSA) and the Motor
Transport Workers Union Â (MTWU) will push
employers to supply crews with properly equipped cash vans, guns and ammunition. FEDUSA says they want to see the design of current cash
trucks upgraded to secure military body metal that incorporates internal vaults
or safes of similar strength in order to withstand heavy weapons and bombs. The unions also want employees working conditions to made
better. "Cash-in-transit crews currently work long hours
without adequate rest doing psychological stressful and dangerous work and
labour will want to see hours of work adjusted to be in line with the Basic
Conditions of Employment Act, with a minimum of four well trained and armed
personnel per vehicle." FEDUSA and the MTWU say they expect employers to provide
professional counselling, services and sick leave for the victims of heists, as
well as their families who may suffer from secondary trauma.
