PROTESTERS torched the administration building at Skapandonda High School in Marite Village, outside Hazyview, on Wednesday. The protesters demanded that people from their village be hired for an upcoming road project. They claim the contractor hired what they call “outsiders”. A resident said a group of young boys jumped the gate and forcefully removed pupils from the premises. Police spokesman Captain Gerald Sedibe said a case of arson has been opened. “Investigations are underway and we have not made any arrests yet,” he said. Mpumalanga Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the department condemns the destruction of public property. He said: “Burning a school will not solve the problem. We hope the police will find the culprits and put them behind bars.” This is not the first time pupils have been inconvenienced by a protest. Last year, a group of residents who were protesting for tarred roads prevented pupils from going to school. Public Works, Roads and Transport MEC Sasekani Manzini visited the area last week to announce the upgrade of the 13,5km road between Marite and Hoxani. She said the R176 million project is expected to be completed by next November.
