ANC national executive committee member Tandi Mahambehlala donated 100 blankets to residents of Pholile and Siyanyanzela in Lwandle, Cape Town, on Saturday. Last month a 10-year-old was killed when a shack caught fire in Pholile. “On Wednesday 10 shacks were destroyed and two children were injured when a fire broke out in the kasi. “I should have done this last month. Our members asked for assistance and we knocked on a few doors to get these blankets,” said Mahambehlala. She accused the City of Cape Town of not caring about people who live in squatter camps. “When a municipality is in the suburbs, the poor will always suffer. “We are engaging with national government to ask the South African National Roads Agency to deliver services to these communities.” She said it is hard to ask people to stop making illegal connections because they cannot survive without electricity. Pholile resident Zikhona Ngqiyi (22), whose brother was burnt to death last month, said he is glad government has not forgotten about them. “Winter is almost here, so these blankets will be put to good use.” Community leader Mwezi Lugwayi said: “This is not part of an election campaign. We asked our leaders for assistance and they delivered. “We are grateful to Mahambehlala for giving blankets to our people.”
