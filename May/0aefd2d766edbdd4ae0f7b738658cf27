POLICE have bust a suspect who’s been on the run since 2015. Nkosinathi Mkhize (44) allegedly defrauded his former employer, the KZN Agriculture Department. Mkhize, who allegedly provided details of a fake company that was supposed to supply chicks to the department, was arrested on Monday. The department deposited R50 000 into the non-existent company’s bank account but the chicks were never supplied. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Mkhize was bust in New Germany, Pinetown. “Police had received a tip-off from residents about the suspect’s whereabouts,” said Zwane. “He’s facing fraud charges and will appear in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court soon.” He failed to appear in the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court for sentencing after he was caught with stolen cables and found guilty of theft. Zwane said Ndlovu’s case was postponed for sentencing, but he never returned to court and moved out of his rented room in France, Pietermaritzburg. “We’re urging anyone who might know his whereabout to contact their nearest police station or call 08600 10111,” Zwane told Daily Sun.
