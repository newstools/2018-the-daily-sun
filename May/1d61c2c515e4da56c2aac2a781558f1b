RESIDENTS of Good Hope squatter camp in Germiston, Ekurhuleni invaded vacant land on Friday. Filled with enthusiasm and renewed hope, and before the sun had even set on their new rickety shelters, they had renamed the place Zikode extension. They said Ekurhuleni Human Settlements MMC Lesiba Mpya promised last September to build them flats. But they were left homeless and stranded when cops took their building material away yesterday. The residents claimed there are no services in the overcrowded Good Hope squatter camp. They’ve apparently been living there for past 25 years. Ben Nzima (60) said: “We’re asking our government to give us stands and electricity so we can build our own houses.” Mpya denied the resident’s claims. He told Daily Sun yesterday the land belonged to the City and there were no plans to build houses or flats there. “That is vacant land we use as temporary locations when there are disasters,” said Mpya.
