A TAXIFY ride turned into a nightmare for Lungile Dlamini on Saturday afternoon. She was sitting in a taxi when the driver allegedly started beating her out of the blue, leaving her with a face full of bruises. The 34-year-old from Umlazi, south of Durban, said she wasn’t able to see clearly out of one eye and was too scared to use taxis again. “That monster could have killed me. I don’t know why he did this but I think he was drunk. “I screamed and eventually people passing by helped me.” Lungile said she suspected the driver wanted to kill her as he threatened to throw her in a place where no one would find her. The SunTeam first learned of Lungile’s horrific experience when her sister Chantay posted photos of her on Twitter. She wrote: “This is my sister who was beaten by a Taxify driver on Saturday afternoon. He also took her belongings.” Taxify responded to the post by requesting Lungile’s contact details. However, the SunTeam understands no one had contacted her this week and no action was taken. Taxify spokeswoman Marilin Noorem said the company was very saddened to hear about what happened to Lungile. However, she said the trip was not booked on the company’s app. “Upon further investigation, it was confirmed there was no record of the trip being taken using the app. “It is therefore difficult to provide further information concerning the case,” she said. Noorem said the company encouraged passengers not to get into cars unless a trip had been booked over the app as the drivers might not have been vetted and couldn’t be tracked down if an incident occurred. A case was opened.
