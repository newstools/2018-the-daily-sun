THE worrying number of road accidents in Limpopo has left residents fearing for their lives. The problem has caught the attention of provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba, who has said he’s seriously concerned about the number of people dying on Limpopo roads. After four people died on Mokwadi Road on Saturday, Ledwaba urged motorists to respect the rules of the road. The accident happened between Polokwane and Dendron. Ledwaba said: “Motorists must at all times respect the Road Traffic Act to prevent the continuous loss of lives we’re seeing. “The SAPS and the relevant traffic law enforcement agencies in the province are going to deal mercilessly with all the drivers who are still breaking the rules of the road.” Provincial police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe believes the accident happened after a driver tried to overtake another vehicle and collided head on with a car travelling in the opposite direction. “Two occupants of a Polo VW and two of a Mazda Etude died instantly. Five occupants of both vehicles sustained serious injuries and were immediately taken to the hospital for medical treatment,” he said. “The process of identifying the dead is still unfolding.” He said police were still investigating the accident and were not yet clear on all the details surrounding it. He urged motorists to put safety first and to avoid taking risks when overtaking cars. He said the number of road deaths seen in the province was still worrying.
