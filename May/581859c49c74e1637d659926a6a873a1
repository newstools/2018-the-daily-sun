POLICE are asking for the mothers of two babies found dumped over the last week. The first baby was a newborn found at a dumping site in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, on Tuesday. The baby was discovered at the Ecaleni dumping site by a woman from Xubeni section. The child had been put inside a black rubbish bag but was still alive and rushed to hospital. Tembisa police spokesman Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha appealed to the public to come forward with information. “The mother of the child is still unknown. The police are appealing to members of the community to come forward. Anyone with information about the baby’s parents should approach the police,” he said. In the second incident, a two-month-old baby was found wrapped in a blanket in the bushes in Springs, Ekurhuleni, on Friday. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said the little girl was transported to Far East Rand Hospital for medical attention and the police were looking for her mum. He requested anyone with information about the mother of the child to come forward to assist the police. Springs station commander Brigadier Thembeka Gwebushe said she was disappointed. She said people with unwanted babies should ask for help from the social development department or NGOs instead of dumping them. The community is requested to contact Springs police at 011 365 5719/20 or 10111.
