BHEKUYISE Magwaza (70) used to cut sugarcane before he was promoted to farm supervisor. But the madala from Doringkop in KwaDukuza, northern KZN, wanted more. Now he owns a farm called Ngqobeni Farm. He said: “I knew agriculture was my only ticket out of poverty. After my parents died, I dropped out of school in grade 11 to start working as a sugarcane cutter. “I became a supervisor in 1976 but I was bored. I quit the job in 1987 to work as a driver. In 2002 I left to start my own farm.” Bhekuyise said the sugar company Tongaat Hulett gave him 93 hectares of land. Ithala Bank helped him buy equipment. “I was 54 when I started running my farm. I feared I was too old to work, so I hired 15 permanent and 60 seasonal workers. I’m training them so they can take over when I die.” His hard work earned him the Agriculture Business of the Year trophy at the Ithala Business Achievers Awards held in March. He said he shares his skills with young people in the area. “I mentor up and coming black farmers in my village “It gives me pleasure to inspire young people to go into the agriculture sector. “Jobs are scarce and not many young people are interested in farming.”
