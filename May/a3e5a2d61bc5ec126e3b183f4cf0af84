WHEN little Karabo Letsema was born two weeks ago, her parents were over the moon. Now her parents, Maletsatsi Letsema (24) and Edwin Langa (30), are preparing to bury their baby girl. The angry couple, from Masakhane Village in Pienaars River, Limpopo, blamed nurses at Bela-Bela Hospital for Karabo’s death. Maletsatsi said her daughter started crying in the early hours of Saturday morning. “Then she stopped crying and started making weird sounds. “I panicked and called the ambulance when I realised she was struggling to breathe,” she said. Maletsatsi said she was relieved when paramedics arrived, but was shocked by the treatment she received at the hospital. She claimed nurses insulted her when she told them Karabo was sick. “The nurses told me that I was the one who was sick for exposing her to the cold weather. “They said nothing was wrong with her.” Maletsatsi said she insisted that her daughter undergo a check-up, but all the nurses did was undress and weigh her. “Even though it was cold, my baby did not cry when they undressed her. “I thought that would prove she was not okay, but that did not change anything. “They told me to go back home.” Maletsatsi said she watched Karabo draw her last breath that afternoon. Edwin said he will never forget the sight of his daughter dying in his arms. He and Maletsatsi said they want answers from the hospital. Edwin said they want to know why the nurses claimed their child was fine when it was clear she was not. “I will not rest until they account for my child’s death. “Had they taken my child’s case seriously, maybe she would still be alive today,” he said. Limpopo health spokesman Neil Shikwambana said the department was not aware of the incident. He said the hospital CEO was asked to write a report so they could investigate the matter.
