COPS arrested four people between the ages of 32 and 64 after
acts of public violence at Seleteng Ga-Mphahlele next to Lebowakgomo. When cops arrived in the
area, the residents had already blocked the road and were also hostile towards
police. Police spokesperson
Brigadier Motlafela MojapeloÂ  said the hostility
reached a boiling point when they started pelting cops with objects. Mojapelo said two cops were
slightly injured and one vehicle had its windows smashed. One state firearm was lost
during the scuffle but was later recovered. "More reinforcements
from Public Order Police were called to the scene and the situation was brought
under control," Mojapelo said. He said the angry residents
are fighting over chieftaincy in the area. The arrested suspects will
appear in the Lebowakgomo and Phalala Magistrate Courts soon on charges of
Assault on Police and Malicious damage to Property. Police investigations are
continuing.
