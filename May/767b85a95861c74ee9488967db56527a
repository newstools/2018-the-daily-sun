The Nebo Regional Court in Limpopo handed down two life sentences to a traditional healer on Wednesday after he was found guilty of raping two children. The 38-year-old man's identity is being concealed to protect the children he raped. National Prosecuting Authority provincial spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said that the traditional healer raped the children between 2014 and 2015. "In the first incident in 2014, the court heard that the 10-year-old minor was playing with her cousin when the accused called the cousin and sent her to the nearby shop to purchase some items," said Malabi-Dzhangi. He said that while the cousin was away, the accused led the complainant to his bedroom, where he undressed her before raping her. After he finished, he offered her an amount of R15 and also threatened to kill her should she tell anyone what had happened. In the second incident, in March 2015, the accused invited the five-year-old complainant to his homestead, pretending that he wanted to send her to the shop. "Upon arrival, the accused took her to his bed, where he proceeded to rape her. The accused is a close relative of the complainant," said Malabi-Dzhangi. During the trial, the man denied the allegations against him. His defence was ultimately rejected by the court. In aggravation of sentence, State prosecutor Johannes Rampedi submitted the victim impact report for both minors, explaining how the incident had impacted them. He added that the accused had betrayed the childrenâ€™s trust in him. Rampedi pleaded with the court to impose a life sentence on each count. Magistrate MJ Motubatsi found that there was no substantial and compelling circumstance to justify a lesser sentence. The court ordered that the traditional healer's name be entered into the National Register for Sexual Offenders. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/traditional-healer-gets-2-life-sentences-for-raping-children-20180502
