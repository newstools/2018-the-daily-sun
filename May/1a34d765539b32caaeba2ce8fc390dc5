A COP has been admitted to hospital after being shot in the head on Tuesday. The 26-year-old constable and a colleague were travelling in a police van when unknown suspects got out of their Toyota Etios and started shooting at them. The cops were attending to a complaint at a local mine when the incident happened in Masha Village, Limpopo. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the cops were approaching a speed hump when the suspects’ car came speeding up from behind and overtook them. “When the cops stopped the car, two suspects with rifles got out of the vehicle and started shooting at police.” Mojapelo said the injured cop was taken to hospital while his colleague escaped unharmed. “He is in a stable condition and we wish him a speedy recovery. “Cops are on the hunt for the suspects. Anyone with information should call Captain Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501, or go to their nearest police station,” he said.
