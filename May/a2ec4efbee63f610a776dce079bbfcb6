Itâ€™s been exactly a year since Kenny Kunene and his wife, Whitney welcomed their baby boy, Remo into the world. Since then, the now one-year-old has been showered with some of the most lavish gifts ever bought for a baby. So much money is spent on this little boy that his Instagram page is Baby Billionaire. Today the baby officially turned one-year-old and to celebrate, Kenny bought him a fleet of luxury mini vehicles. The fleet includes a Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bentley, Mercedes Benz and the classic Cadillac. OFFICIALLY 1YEAR OLD TODAY Monday 7th. Had a Blast with family yesterday.
