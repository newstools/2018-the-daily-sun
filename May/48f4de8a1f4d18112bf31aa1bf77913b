ANGRY parents closed Kid Maponya Primary School in Kagiso, Mogale City on Friday morning. They accused the principal of mismanaging school funds. Kids were forced to go home early. The parents also accused the principal of not recognising the school governing body. Modiegi Metsi (45) said they wanted the principal to be removed from the school. “He misuses funds and there’s no development at the school. More than 100 kids share a classroom.” A resident said: “There’s a Cell C tower in the school yard and the company pays R6 000 a month for it. “But the principal doesn’t declare this source of income and pockets all the money.” Steve Mabona, spokesman for Gauteng Education Department, confirmed that they were investigating the matter. “Our officials were sent to the school and we are engaging all partners to resolve the matter,” said Mabona. Cops were on the scene to make sure the situation didn’t get out of hand.
