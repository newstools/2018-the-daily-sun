Siyavuya Bani (13) said: “We enjoyed ourselves and being the number one school has encouraged us to do more.” Nontlahla Ndiyalwa (12) said it was an awesome experience which she would love to do again. “The competition was good. It just needed concentration,” said Nontlahla. The pupils were awarded certificates and a trophy. Nontlahla said: “We’re glad that when our teachers mention the pupils who have represented the school well, our names will be included.” School principal Siphokazi Lobese said she was grateful to have dedicated teachers who always pushed their pupils to do their best. “Our school is a beacon of hope in this community. We are lucky to have kids who always want to do well and put the name of the schools above other schools in Philippi,” she said.
