AN international humanitarian organisation teamed up with churches in Khayelitsha to educate men about gender-based violence and the relationship between religion and health. On Saturday, scores of men attended an indaba organised by Doctors Without Borders. They were tested for sexually transmitted diseases before the event, which took place at Blue Hall in Site C. Event organiser Simo Sithandathu said: “We are not saying men are the ones responsible for every act of gender-based violence. “Some of them are victims. “If they are victims, we should tell them where they can get help.” He said Doctors Without Borders wants to help men, especially those who attend church, stay healthy. Sithandathu said since they started their campaign in 2015, clinics have seen an increase in the number of men being tested for HIV. “Most of the people we tested this year were men. It wasn’t like that in the past. Pastor Innocent Kulla, spokesman for Great Commission Ministers Network, said it is important for people to be healthy. “There are churches that spiritualise everything and discourage people from taking care of their bodies. “A lot needs to be done, as many of us have been sidelined from events like this,” said Kulla. Zuko Boyce (46), one of the men who attended the indaba, said: “This was an important meeting for men. I learnt a lot. “I was one of the people who didn’t want to get tested but our pastors encouraged us to come to the indaba. “The information we got helped us.” The event was organised in partnership with the City of Cape Town, the provincial government and non-governmental organisations Treatment Action Campaign and Anova Health Institute.
