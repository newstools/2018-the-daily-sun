A DAY at the race course turned into a drunken nightmare
when about 25 wasted men laid into each other. Watch the video below! According to The
Sun, all hell broke loose last Saturday at the Goodwood Racecourse in
Chichester, England. The men had apparently been gulping down liquor all day
and they took the brawl they had been having in the pub outside. Six men needed medical treatment, according to the report.
