CLARA Mthethwa is devastated! It seems her husband sold their Clayville home in Ekurhuleni, which they built in 2005 with their own money. Clara said at the weekend, she had a visit from hell from unknown men. “They demanded I leave the house and told me they wanted to demolish it. “Before I knew what was going on, my belongings were being thrown out.” She said they told her they bought the house from her husband. “I haven’t seen that man for three years. He left without a word and never came back. When I asked about his whereabouts, I was told he lived in Mozambique.” Clara said she didn’t bother going after him because he left their two children with her. When Daily Sun visited the house, the family of three was stranded outside their yard. Furniture, a fridge, mattresses, clothes and appliances were outside. Clara said what amazes her is her husband never filed for a divorce. According to her they bought the stand together in 2003 and erected a mkhukhu. “We both worked hard until we could build this house in 2005. The men started to break down the house and were removing the window and door frames before they were stopped by angry residents. They ordered the men to leave. An angry resident said: “We won’t allow anyone to occupy that house until Clara receives the money, if it has been sold. How can someone build a house and then break it apart? “There is something wrong going on here but we will get to the bottom of it.” When the family approached the police, they were told they needed to find the missing husband before a case could be opened.
