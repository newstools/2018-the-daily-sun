Celebrities such as Thando Thabethe, Pearl Thusi and Thembisa Mdoda immediately voiced their disapproval in the way Masechaba handled the Interview with Babes and now her father has echoed the same sentiments.

"Metro FM left us with many unanswered questions. It was clear from the interview that our daughter was not ready and was caught off guard by the presenter. We hope responses about this interview will come from those relevant," said Simelane. He went on to add that the family had no knowledge of Babes and Mampinstha's romantic relationship, as far as the family was concerned; the two were just business partners. Despite the abuse revelations, Babes’ father thanked Mampintsha for recognising and bringing her daughter’s talent to the spotlight. “After all, we thank Mandla Maphumulo for discovering talent in Babes and grooming her to be where she currently is. We thank all those who supported our daughter, it’s truly showed how much she is loved,” he said. Babes Wodumo is now an independent artist and has started her own record label, Wena Wodumo.
