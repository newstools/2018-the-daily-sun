VUYO Mbilana (46) from Browns Farm, Philippi in Cape Town opened a body building and fitness gym to help kasi people lead healthy lives. He said he did it because it is important for people to be active. “Even doctors say so. This gym is walking distance from everyone and I’m here to help,” said Vuyo. He said for people to lead a healthy lifestyle, they need to make training part of their daily lives. “This gym is as good as those in town. People no longer have an excuse about money,” he said. The gym opened last month and already has 70 members. The joining fee is R200 and there are discounts for groups, whether soccer players or churchgoers, including pensioners. Kids aged 16 to 18 years pay R100. Mthunzi Notyilana (36) said the gym was something the community needed. It is open daily until about 9pm to accommodate workers.
