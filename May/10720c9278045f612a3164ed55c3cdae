The Kwazulu-Natal provincial government has increased the Zulu royal household budget by 6.9 million for 2018. The budget allocation for the Royal household in the previous years was R58.9, so this means the monarch will now get R65.8 million a year. KZN Premier Willis Mchunu defended this decision saying the king is doing a whole lot more for the province. He said the king has been to overseas as an ambassador for the province and to seek investment for the province. "He has also contributed to the social well being of the people," said Mchunu. He said his office will continue to support the Royal House Trust to execute its responsibilities of rendering services to the Royal Household. The responsibilities include taking care of the upkeep of the royal palaces, supporting the tuition, transportation and medical care for members of the royal family, as well as Royal farming activities. He added that there plans are also on the cards to ensure that the Zulu Royal Household generate its own revenue to reduce its dependence in government allocation. Mchunu said they have developed a revenue generating plan to pursue public-private partnerships in exploring opportunities to utilise the Zulu Royal Household brand as a potential source of income to relieve the trustâ€™s dependency on government money.
