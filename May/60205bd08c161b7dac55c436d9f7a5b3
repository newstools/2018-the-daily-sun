THE confusion that reigned for weeks in the North province is over. Premier Supra Mahumapelo has finally resigned as premier. In recent weeks Mahumapelo made conflicting statements about whether he will resign or not. For weeks Mzansi has been waiting for him to announce his resignation, "I take this opportunity to thank the ANC for the deployment and I want the ANC to accept that i'm going on an early retirement as premier. "As I embark on early retirement from the position of Premier in the province, I hope that we will intensify the fight against greed crime and corruption.Â ," said Mahumapelo on Wednesday. ANC secretary Ace Magashule thanks Supra for his services. "We are happy that he has come to this selfless decision and we support the resignation of Cde supra Mahumapelo," he said. The team appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa has placed a number of departments in North West under administration due to corruption and maladministration.
