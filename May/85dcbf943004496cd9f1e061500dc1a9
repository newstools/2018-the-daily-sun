HE didn’t get far in school, but that wouldn’t stop Khuliso Madida from providing for his parents and siblings. The hardworking 30-year-old man had a vegetable garden on the banks of the Luvuvhu River. But the water that fed his garden was also hiding the humble man’s horrible death! Khuliso from Tsaulu Village outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo disappeared on Saturday after telling his mum he was going to his garden. That was the last time he was seen alive. His body was found floating in the river on Monday afternoon after a massive search. Cops said he was probably killed by crocodiles. One leg, his left hand and intestines were missing. His aunt Mavis Mugwena said they last saw Khuliso on Saturday at 11am. “We expected him to come back at about 8pm as usual,” she said. “Khuliso’s mum became worried but couldn’t do anything as it was late already.” Mavis said the next day his mum and brother went to the river but only found his trousers, work clothes, maize meal and a gardening tool. “We’re very sad. Khuliso was a good man who, despite his lack of education, worked hard so the family wouldn’t go to sleep on empty stomachs,” she said. “We don’t know what happened to him. He was found only in his underwear. “We won’t rest until we know the truth,” said Mavis. She said they don’t have money to bury him. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said a body was found without a hand and leg. Investigations are continuing.
