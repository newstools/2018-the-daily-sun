LAST WEEK the People’s Paper published the sad story of Elizabeth Mbonani, who died after drinking acid. She found out the father of her children had another woman. Elizabeth (30) died a slow and painful death after the acid started destroying her insides. Her sad mum, Stephina Mbonani (62), was desperately worried about burying her child. When Daily Sun called Incredible Happenings Church leader Prophet Paseka Motsoeneng, he immediately helped the grieving family. Motsoeneng, popularly known as Mboro, helped the family in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni to bury their loved one, who had been in the morgue for longer than two weeks. “I was very touched by what happened to the family. “That is why I chose to give the woman a dignified funeral,” said Mboro. The funeral took place at the Vlakfontein Cemetery in Ekurhuleni on Thursday morning and it was also attended by church members. Stephina said: “I am very grateful to Pastor Mboro for the great work he has done for my family and I. “We really appreciate his effort and also thank Daily Sun. “We will now live in peace, knowing Elizabeth is safe in her final resting place.”
