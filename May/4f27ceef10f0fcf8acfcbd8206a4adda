THEY may have been evicted, but they’re still sleeping where their mkhukus used to be. Residents of Khombisa in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, were sleeping early last Tuesday morning when cops arrived and tore down their shacks. The mkhukus and some of their belongings were taken away by the cops, but the people have vowed not to move. Resident George Molema (38) said no one would force him to leave the area he called home. “We’re going nowhere. We have stand numbers and we’re here legally. I’m left with a sofa and some rags to sleep under,” he said. “I have no place to go and that’s why I’m sleeping here. I’ve been here for a year.” Mercy Khumalo (46) said after the cops destroyed her shack, all she was left with was a mattress base. “I have nowhere else to sleep. I don’t have a roof over my head. The uniformed police evicted us, despite the fact that we’re here legally,” she said. Mercy said her two kids, aged 16 and 20, were badly affected by the disruption to their lives. “My 20-year-old is suffering the most because she’s busy with her university exams,” she said. Human settlements MMC Lesiba Mpya said residents needed to be patient. “We’ve seen people occupying land illegally in different parts of Ekurhuleni,” he said. “This is because they run out of patience while waiting for RDPs. “We’re working very hard to address the matter of housing, and the people shouldn’t occupy land forcibly.”
