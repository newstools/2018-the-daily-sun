Rumours making the rounds on social media and the media suggest another one of Mzansiâ€™s favourite couples have called it quits. Reports suggest media darling Nomzamo Mbatha and hunky model boyfriend Maps Maponyane have called time on their relationship. The pair who served up major couple goals on social media and whose relationship was the envy of many, are yet to comment on these rumours. However, TshisaLIVE has reported that Maps was allegedly not faithful to the Isibaya actress who has a bad experience with cheating, hence the alleged split. "The cheating rumours are nothing new but Nomzamo got proof that couldn't be disputed. She's upset. She didn't expect this. "They were good friends and he betrayed that trust. She's gone through this before and he was the one who was there for her during that time," an insider told the publication. Nomzamo has since deleted pictures of herself and Maps on her social media further fuelling the speculation that the pair have gone their separate ways.
