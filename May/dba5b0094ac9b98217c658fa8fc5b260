BONGEKA Majola said she has lived in her shack most of her life. The 31-year-old mum from Ezinkawini Q section in Umlazi, south of Durban claimed the ward committee members were forcing her to leave the area. “They told me the eThekwini Municipality wanted to build toilets where my shack is built. “The committee said I’d be paid R3 500 as compensation,” Bongeka said. “They gave me forms to sign but I refused to sign them. Now they’ve threatened to demolish my shack. But we won’t move out.” Bongeka lives with her unemployed brother (30) and her three kids aged 13, nine and six. She said the shack belonged to her late mum. “This shack was damaged by heavy rain before. But I rebuilt it for the sake of my family,” said Bongeka. “Now the committee is threatening to demolish it if I don’t move out. “I don’t know what to do.” Sindi Mkhize, a ward committee secretary, said Bongeka had agreed that her land could be used for the toilets. “She even agreed to sign the forms and take the R3 500 compensation,” said Mkhize. When Daily Sun asked Mkhize to send a copy of the forms Bongeka allegedly signed, she refused. Bongeka denied signing the forms or agreeing to take the money.
