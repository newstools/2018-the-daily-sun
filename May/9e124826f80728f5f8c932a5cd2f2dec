THE mourners were already waiting at the dead woman’s home – but the body was stuck at the funeral parlour. In the end the distraught family of Zoliswa Sikwatana (46) from Xhora, near Mthatha, had to bury her a day late, with only tea to serve to mourners. They blame it all on a funeral parlour worker who they claimed delayed releasing the body. Zoliswa died last month in Gcuwa and was supposed to be buried on Saturday Her sister, Ntombekhaya Mrwatyu, claimed the delay was because of a parlour attendant in Gcuwa. She said her sister had no funeral cover and the parlour was the second one she’d asked for help. The first funeral parlour wouldn’t agree to receive payment in instalments. “I was then required to pay for the days my sister stayed in their parlour. The money was paid. “When people from my home went to collect the body they stood at the parlour gate for hours. We called the attendant but he said he was still on the way. Hours passed and we had to postpone the funeral,” said Ntombekhaya. She said on Sunday only tea was served. “I made loans to hold this funeral and I want that attendant to pay for this,’ she said. However funeral parlour assistant Mzomhle Nontantane said he went out of his way to help the grieving family. “They said they would come to fetch the body on Friday and I waited until 8pm but they didn’t arrive. I called the sister on Saturday morning and she said people were on the way. I waited until my knock-off time at 12pm. I only received a call telling me people were at the gate later and had to call a friend to take me to the parlour. It was late when we got there,” said Nontantane. Sanlam regional manager Walter Masitla said they would investigate.
