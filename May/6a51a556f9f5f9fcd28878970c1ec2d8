GOGO Nokhariyothi Apolis was spoiled at her 108th birthday celebration on Saturday. Before being taken to her special party, Nokhariyothi was surprised with a trip to the spa for a full body massage. The gogo from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, didn’t know what to say when she found out about the party as it was all a surprise. “They took me to a place where people were touching me. I said my feet were painful and now they are better. “God sees I’m poor and He planned the whole thing by sending these people.” On Thursday, when she turned 108, DA councillor Thulani Stemela surprised Nokhariyothi at home with a cake. “It’s good to take care of older people. We are where we are because of them,” said Stemela. The surprise party was organised by the Zibonele community radio station and was held at Rainbow Creche at site B. Broadcasting director Ntebelang Shete said when they heard about the gogo, they wanted to do something for her. She thanked Luthando Adonis Foundation for the cake and Women With Integrity for taking the gogo to the spa. Gogo’s daughter Nozuko (52) said she was very happy her mum had such a nice day. “We never thought our mum would get something like this. God bless you all.” Nokhariyothi, who likes rice and pap with sugar, advised youth to stay away from drugs and booze and for people to respect elders.
