BEING short is a terrible curse! According to Mapula Morudu (46), she is teased about her height every time she walks on the street in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. And she can’t find a job. Mapula, who was born with a condition called dwarfism, told Daily Sun she believed it prevents her from finding work. The type of dwarfism she suffers means that both her limbs and her body are unusually small. Mapula’s daughter Dineo Moribi (18) suffers from the same condition. Mapula said she had not had a proper job for 20 years and relied on hand-outs to live. “I wash dishes for people who call me to help and they give me some money. I also clean people’s houses to get money for food,” she said. “My condition is really a curse because I can’t work like other people. Being short is not nice at all.” Dineo said she had visited the social development department to get a grant but she was unsuccessful. “They told me I’m normal and I must stop complaining because I am not disabled,” she said. Gauteng Social Development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said they would assess Mapula’s situation. “Social workers and other officials will be sent to the family to try and assist,” he said.
