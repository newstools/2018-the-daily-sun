Patients at Tshepong
Hospital in Klerksdorp, North West, have been left stranded after angry
protesters stormed in and forced doctors and nurses out of the wards on
Wednesday morning. "Protesters chased
staff from the wards and the patients were left stranded. Those who were coming
to perform their duties in the morning were barred from entering the
hospital," said the hospital's public relations officer, Nico Masiu. Health services in the
province have been affected after the National Education, Health and Allied
Workers Union embarked on a strike two months ago. Masiu said, in the past two
weeks, the hospital had been forced to send patients home. "The protesters would
come and disrupt everything and then, two to three hours later, they would then
go home. We don't know what to do. We have requested intervention from the
police," he said. News24 previously reported
that President Cyril Ramaphosa had decided to place the North West health
department under the administration of the national government in the wake of
the protests. DEVELOPING: Vocal

the leadership of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma - to get to the bottom of the crisis,
which has also been exacerbated by protests calling for the removal of Premier
Supra Mahumapelo. Provincial health
spokesperson Tebogo Lekgethwane described the situation at Tshepong Hospital as
tense, saying it was using skeleton staff. He added that only critically
ill patients and emergencies were being attended to. "We are appealing to
people that they can protest, but they must allow those who are sick to receive
medical attention," he said. Meanwhile, North West
police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said he was not aware of the
incident.
