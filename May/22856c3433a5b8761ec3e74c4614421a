WHEN Sello Mkhonto was recently promoted at work, it was supposed to make his life better. But instead it led to his death! The 27-year-old’s body was found on Saturday by a delivery truck crew in a storeroom at his workplace in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga. His body was covered with crates, and sprayed with the white powder from a fire extinguisher. His family believes Sello was killed because of his promotion at work. They say he had complained about being badly treated at work ever since being promoted. Sello’s gogo Jane (62), said her grandson was called to work on Friday afternoon. She said it was his day off but he decided to answer the call of duty that night. “On Saturday morning when he knocked off, he found people waiting for him at the door. He quickly ran back to the shop and told one of the supervisors who advised him to use another door to leave,” she said. “When he found the same men waiting for him at the other door, he went back into the shop again. “That was the last time he was seen alive. The next thing he was found dead in the shop’s storeroom.” Gogo Jane said they had a family function that day and they tried to call Sello many times to come home but his phone rang unanswered. “Later that evening we were told the bad news that he was in the mortuary.” Sarita van Wyk from Shoprite Checkers confirmed that Sello’s body was found on Saturday. “He returned to the premises after clocking out from his night shift duty,” she said KwaMhlanga Police Captain Nonhlanhla Kgosana said an inquest docket had been opened for investigation.
