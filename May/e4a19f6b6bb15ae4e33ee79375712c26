Sechaba said he was shocked to see about 50 men dressed in yellow approaching
his gate.  “They broke my gate and
entered my house! Without any explanation, they men started taking my stuff out
of the the house and all my belongings were scattered in the streets,” he said.  He said he was not aware of
the eviction and one of the men who came told him that he bought the house at
R75 000. “How can someone buy a
house at R75 000 which I bought at R480 000."   “I don’t understand and the
people who came to throw me out of my house don’t want to explain to me what is
happening,” he said. The award winning artist
was helped by his neighbour where took his belongings and his family. 'After the men in yellow
had finished taking everything from the house, they locked the gate with their
own keys and left three men inside the yard to guard the property.'  Drums and other musical
instruments were also featured on the dumped items out in the streets. “They have locked my dog
inside the yard and I don’t know what they will feed it because everything is
out.' Drums and other musical
instruments were also featured on the dumped items out in the streets. Sechaba was at the scene as
his furniture and other belongings basked in the sun.
