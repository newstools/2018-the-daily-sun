The Western Cape High Court has ruled that Patricia De Lille remains the mayor of Cape Town. De Lille approached the court after her party membership was terminated by the DA last week. Judgment in this urgent matter was heard in Court on Tuesday. This, after judgment was reserved on Friday, May 11, after counsel for both parties presented their arguments in the application. The court ruled that De Lille remains mayor and DA councillor, pending outcome of 25 May. The parties last week agreed to review the merits of De Lille's removal in full on May 25 and timelines have been set for the filing of supplementary papers. The DA immediately tweeted it has noted the ruling. "We remain confident that the substantive case on the cessation of #deLille’s party’s membership will be successful," said the DA.
