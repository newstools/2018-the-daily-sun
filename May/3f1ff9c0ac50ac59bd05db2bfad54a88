THANKS to the Google Impact Challenge SA, millions of rands will be donated to non-profit organisations. The challenge was launched on Wednesday in Sandton, northern Joburg. Google is committing about R25 million which will see funding awarded to innovative organisations using technology to reach their goals. The challenge is open to all registered NGOs whether newly established or already operational. The organisations must also have a community impact, a reach, must be innovative and must be feasible “Four organisations in South Africa stand to win about R3 million each, while eight runners-up will each get about R1,5 million,” said the organisation. Winners will be decided by a panel of local judges and a public vote. The Mzansi judging panel includes HuffPost SA editor-at-large Ferial Haffajee, TV personality Basetsana Kumalo, actress Nomzamo Mbatha, Google SA country director Luke Mckend, singer Yvonne Chaka Chaka, TV personality Maps Maponyane, singer and songwriter Simphiwe Dana and computer scientist and entrepreneur Rapelang Rabana. The public vote will also provide a chance for the people to decide which organisation gets an extra portion of funding. The winning non-profit organisation will get cash as well as access to guidance, technical assistance and mentorship from Google. Mzamo Masito, Google Africa chief marketing officer, said it is the first time they are running the challenge on the continent. “Many African NGOs are doing great work with real impact. “We are keen to shine a light on them and give a financial boost to innovative projects and ideas,” he said.
