VILLAGERS from Mashiwase in Illovo, south of Durban are asking for the provincial department of health’s intervention. This is because their local health facility, Nkwali Clinic, has not been operational for three months and patients are suffering. One of them, Bongani Cele (38), said the closure came as a result of clinic management’s failure to resolve issues villagers were not happy about. “Nurses were mistreating us. They would leave us unattended for several hours. When we complained, they would call us clueless rural people. Even our HIV statuses were being announced in public,” he said. Cele said after several unattended complaints, in February they marched to the clinic to get management to set up a date to meet and talk with them. “The staff vacated the clinic and never returned. When they left, we were told they were going to get advice from the department regarding the meeting. We’ve not heard about any progress being made on the matter,” he said. Another resident, Thabani Mashimane (25), said chronic patients who usually collected their medication from Nkwali now have to travel long distances to Illovo and Amanzimtoti clinics. Local induna Phila Gumede (48) confirmed that Nkwali Clinic’s closure had brought misery to the village. He said, however, there was hope the matter would be resolved. “Last Wednesday we had a meeting with officials from the department. They said they were waiting for a directive from MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo,” he said. KZN health spokesman Ncumisa Mafunda said the process to resolve the challenges was advanced and they would announce results in due course.
