WHEN they hear vuvuzelas in their kasi, they lay in their beds trembling in fear. Several residents claim to have been robbed of their belongings at Emaphupheni in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, by people they call “vuvuzela thugs”. They said they hear the thugs blow vuvuzelas before taking to the streets to rob people. A victim, Joe Fubeco, said they broke into his house and stole a 40-inch JVC plasma curve TV, R2000 in cash and a pair of Nike takkies on Wednesday. Residents said the number of housebreakings in the area had risen. They said they had opened cases, but nobody got caught. Another victim told Daily Sun she did not go out when she heard the vuvuzelas. “I froze when they broke into my shack. They demanded money and they assaulted me. “We appeal to cops to patrol this area often to scare them off.” Another victim, Joel Mahamba, said some of the thugs stand in the street with the vuvuzelas while others strike. “We suspect these thugs are people who live among us and know us well. They know what we own. Nobody can break into our homes without information. We work hard for our things and they just come and take them.” Captain Ramothakhi of Etwatwa cop shop confirmed several cases of housebreaking were reported in the area. “We appeal to those with information to help us catch these thugs so we can restore peace in the area.”
