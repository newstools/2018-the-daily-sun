SOME of the widows of the Carletonville miners broke down in tears during the memorial service on Thursday. Seven miners were killed at Sibanye-Stillwater’s Masakhane mine on the West Rand of Joburg after a “seismic event” on Thursday last week. Minister of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe was speaking at the memorial service of the miners. Widow Makeniso Ntsekha was stretched out of the tent to an ambulance after she broke down. Makeniso lost her husband in the tragedy.  Another woman, Nontsindiso Dudleka, who also lost her husband Nkosiphendule Dudleka in the tragedy, also broke down as she was about to light a candle at the memorial service.  On behalf of the state, Mantashe directed condolences  to the families, friends, unions, employees  and all mineworkers. He said that mineworkers are not statistic, they are human beings and "we must give them respect and  honour that they deserve."  "Workers fought for a right to refuse to enter a dangerous space. We must enforce this right "To undermine safety because there must be production is unacceptable. We must not allow this He said this makes it urgent for "all of us" to come together and discuss state of safety in the industry. "All of us, we have a duty to make the mining industry safer and better. "I'm open to talk to unions. I also talk to employers regularly. When we engage, we understand each other better."
