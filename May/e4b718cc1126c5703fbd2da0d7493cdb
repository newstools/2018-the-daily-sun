ROBERT Khumalo is a happy madala. The 68-year-old from Mboza Village in Jozini, northern KZN has finally received his birth certificate. Robert waited eight years for his application to be processed by Home Affairs. Joy was the order of the day when madala got the birth certificate on Wednesday. Robert told Daily Sun: “The birth certificate means I now have an ID number. “This is a huge achievement for me because it gives me hope that in a few months’ time, I’ll be able to apply for a pension grant.” He said he was grateful to Daily Sun for publishing his story. “After my story was published, I immediately got help after struggling for eight years to get the birth certificate.” Councillor Sbabazi Gumede read madala’s story and decided to help. “The councillor ensured that I got help from Home Affairs. “I am grateful to him and the People’s Paper for helping me get my birth certificate,” said madala Robert. Gumede said he was only doing his job when he decided to help. “On the same day his birth certificate was issued, I ensured that madala Robert applied for an ID. When he gets it, I will help him apply for a pension grant. He desperately needs the grant because he doesn’t have any support system,” said Gumede.
