Following a
deadly attack by Israeli Defence Force troops on protesting Palestinians, some local organisations have condemned the attack. More than
40 protesters were killed on Monday after Pro-Palestinian protesters protested
against the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel. Political
parties like the EFF, and labour unions like the National Union of Metalworkers
South Africa (NUMSA) have spoken out against the killings. They have
called on South Africa to expel the Israeli Ambassador. “The
decision by the U.S. to recognize Jerusalem was an act of extreme provocation
against the people of Palestine,” NUMSA general secretary Irvin Jim said. “Apartheid
Israel acts with impunity because it has the financial and military backing of
the government of the imperialist U.S. government. “NUMSA has
noted the decision by the South African government to recall the Ambassador to
Israel in protest against the aggression of Israel. “Whilst
this is certainly a step in the right direction much more needs to be done. “We demand
the immediate expulsion of the Israeli ambassador from South Africa and that
all trade ties between the two countries must be severed.” The
EFF has welcomed South Africa’s decision to recall its Ambassador to Israel in
protest of the "racist Israeli aggression on Palestine”. The EFF has said in a
statement that: “This,
however, is a much simple move to a deeper problem about the injustice visited
on Palestinians by the apartheid state of Israel. We call on South Africa to
expel the Israeli mission to our country as an example to the whole world that
a relationship to Israel is complicity with its racist aggression on
Palestinians.”
