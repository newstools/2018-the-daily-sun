THERE will be no strangers in the National First Division (NFD) promotion playoffs next month, with familiar faces, Black Leopards and Jomo Cosmos, having secured their seats. Now they are waiting for the results from Saturday’s final round of Absa Premiership matches to discover who will join them in the dog-eat-dog play-offs. Polokwane City, Baroka FC, SuperSport United and Ajax Cape Town are all in danger. Leopards head coach Joel Masutha has warned his players to not become overexcited about their qualification, following their 3-0 thrashing of Cosmos in their last NFD match at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday. Lidoda Duvha completed the season second in the standings ahead of third placed Cosmos. Highlands Park were crowned champions and are back in the PSL too. Leopards’ goals were scored by Joseph Mhlongo and Karabo Tshepe, who registered a brace. “It was a good win and we’re happy to have made it to the play-offs,” Masutha said. “The boys are happy to have achieved our first goal. But I warned them that we have not achieved our final goal yet. We still have tough matches ahead in the play-offs and need to focus. “Obviously our main goal is to gain promotion to the PSL – and then we can celebrate.” He added: “Anyone has a chance in the play-offs. The good thing about us is that we have experience in competing in the play-offs – we know what to expect. “It won’t be easy, though. But I believe we have a chance like anyone else. It will be tough but we will prepare well for them and fight to reach our goal.” Masutha said he would love to face Ajax or United in the play-offs. “The reason I am saying that is because it would be nice to have three teams in the PSL from Limpopo,” said Masutha. “Imagine having to play against Baroka and City in the PSL, wouldn’t that be good for the development of football in the province? But let’s wait for Saturday.” The mini-league play-offs will run from 16 May until 2 June.
