KHAYELITSHA, Cape Town cops have donated toiletries and other goodies to Yizani Sakhe Ubunye Educare Centre. Captain William Fortuin said they want to change the idea that cops only arrest people. “Most people and especially kids are afraid of the police. We want to change that.” He said the sector police visits businesspeople around Khayelitsha. “In everything we do, we need to involve them because they belong in this community.” The centre that was started in 2003 has 102 kids and founder Nomthunzi Mahlasela (58) was happy to receive the donations. “We will forever be grateful. We need all the help we can get,” she said. She said it would be good if the police were visible at their centre as they were once robbed. “Thugs took our money. Now that the officers are here, we will ask them to be more visible so criminals stay away from us.” Isithandile Sikhunyana (6) was happy with the goodies. “I can’t wait to go home and show my mum what we got,” said the child. Captain Ntandazo Mncanca said they identified creches that need help. “We came up with the idea of helping pre-schools. “We know some are really struggling. We adopted some that local business people can help.”
