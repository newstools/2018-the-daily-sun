A serial rapist has been
handed five life sentences and a further 20 years in jail for seven counts of
rape in the Eastern Cape High Court in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday, provincial
police said. Captain Andre Beetge said
that 30-year-old Vusumzi Snyman, from KwaZakele, had been linked through DNA to
the seven rapes. Four of the rapes took
place in KwaZakele and the other three happened in New Brighton. They took place between
2011 and 2012. Beetge said Snyman's modus
operandi was to kick down the victims' home doors, before raping and robbing
them at knifepoint. "The court also handed
him a further 53-year sentence for the robberies," Beetge said. Snyman's victims were
between the ages of 21 and 60. Beegte said the local
Motherwell cluster and Eastern Cape family violence, child protection and
sexual offences units had investigated the seven cases. Motherwell cluster
commander Major General Dawie Rabie applauded the two units for their excellent
detective and investigative skills. "Suspects thinking of
committing these offences will now be discouraged, knowing that long prison
sentences are given to rapists," he said. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/eastern-cape-serial-rapist-gets-5-life-sentences-plus-73-years-in-prison-20180509
