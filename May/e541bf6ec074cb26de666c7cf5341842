BEAUTIFUL little Dineo Makofane (6) suffers from a type of cancer known as leukemia. Her dream is to be a cop one day and protect defenceless people against the bad guys. On Thursday morning, Dineo, from Burgersfort in Limpopo, came to Tshwane to live her dream for one wonderful day. After the Reach for a Dream Foundation wrote a letter to the Brooklyn police, the cops opened their hearts and Dineo found herself in uniform, surrounded by real policemen. She even took part in a staged car hijacking. She reported for duty, put on her uniform and started her day on parade with police officers. She helped to stamp documents at the community service centre. Then Dineo went with the cops to attend to a make-believe hijacking situation. The incident involved the Pretoria K9 unit and the Brooklyn police. Dineo became part of a car chase, where the suspects were caught by the police and dogs from the K9 unit. She helped the cops to handcuff the suspects and to take fingerprints and then detained a suspect in a police holding cell. Dineo said: “I don’t have any doubts. “I want to be a police officer. “It is a very good job for me. “Today was wonderful,” she said. The foundation said: “We believe the fulfilment of a child’s dream who is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness has the positive effect of inspiring hope and courage in the dreamer. “This helps them believe that tomorrow is worth fighting for.” She received a K9 trophy and a police friendship certificate, signed by Brooklyn station commander Brigadier Kushie Nair. Little Dineo, who is a strong young girl, is on treatment and hopes to overcome her disease.
