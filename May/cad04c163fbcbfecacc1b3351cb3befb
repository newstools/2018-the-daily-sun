G ift “Maggz” Magubane has every reason to be proud of himself. His second album, For The Love And Glory, has been doing well in the market. It features hits such as Big Time and pH. Maggz from Pimville, Soweto, said: “When you take a closer look at my career, you’ll realise I’ve always been a team player. “I’ve always been that guy who sacrificed to see friends succeed. “I’ve been fortunate in so many things in life, and it was really for the love and glory. “The glory part is more about the love of fans, not trophies.” Maggz said his music is all about changing people’s lives. “My previous single, Changes, resonated with people so well.” He said even though We On Fire made him famous, Changes still talks about changing people’s lives. Maggz recorded For The Love And Glory in 2016 but only released it last year. “I was supposed to drop it under CashTime Life label, but things didn’t work out and I had to hassle,” said Maggz. “The energy for the album came after experiencing problems such as break-ups to feeling betrayed by friends. “I then found comfort in music.” Maggz said he was working on an album before For The Love And Glory with Bongani Fassie, but his computer was stolen by thugs. He told SunBuzz he was now in his own world and pushing his own movement. Maggz said he has signed artists such as Syriee and Mordy under his record label.
