IT’S still unclear whether the murder of ANC member Nkosikhona Maxhakana was politically motivated or a criminal act. The 56-year-old was shot dead at his home in Rietvlei, near Umzimkhulu, southern KZN, on Saturday night. Harry Gwala District ANC secretary Sindi Msomi said at the time of his murder, Maxhakana was no longer active in politics. He was serving as a community development worker for the co-operative governance department. “He used to be an active member but after he started his job, he decided to rather focus on it. His death shocked us and we believe the police will investigate and make arrests,” she said. “That is when we will be able to find out the motive behind his death because we cannot guarantee it was related to politics.” ANC leaders in the district visited Maxhakana’s family yesterday. Msomi said 14 ANC members had been killed in the district since last year and said it was worrying that no arrests in connection with the killings had been made. Mayor Mphuthumi Mpabanga said he knew Maxhakana. “When Maxhakana was still active in politics, he worked hard for the party.” Maxhakana’s murder follows that of Lower South Coast treasurer Sfiso Cele and Moses Mabhida branch convener Maqatha Mchunu. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said Maxhakana was at home fixing a light bulb when unknown men shot him several times. “He sustained multiple gunshot wounds and died on the scene,” she said. Mbhele said a murder case was opened at Ibisi Police Station.
