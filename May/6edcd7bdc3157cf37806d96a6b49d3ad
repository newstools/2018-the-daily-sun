THE mum of a 19-year-old girl who was burned to death said she would never find peace until she knew what started the fire that robbed her of her daughter. Gugulethu Dludla (35) from Nkukhwini Village near KwaDukuza, in northern KZN told Daily Sun she was not home on Sunday when her daughter, Luwiza, was killed. She said she rushed home after receiving a call from neighbours. She found her neighbours already at her house, trying to fight the blaze. Gugulethu told Daily Sun her daughter’s bedroom was the only room of four rooms that was burnt. “My child was alone in the house. I have many unanswered questions because it is not clear how the fire started,” said the mother. Gugulethu said the reason she was confused was that her daughter’s room had no electricity and she didn’t use a candle because when other rooms were lit, they made her room light because the house had no ceilings. “What I noticed when I got to her room on the day of the incident was a hole in the window and I suspect foul play. “There was nothing in her room that would have caused the fire,” said Gugulethu. She said she believed that someone broke the window and threw an explosive into Luwiza’s room. Gugulethu said her daughter had no enemies that she knew of. “I would like to know the person who did this. I want them to tell me what my child did to them. Maybe knowing who or what caused the fire will help me heal,” said Gugulethu. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said that an inquest docket was being investigated by KwaDukuza police. “A woman died after sustaining burn wounds when the house she was in caught fire. The cause of fire is still unknown. The investigations are continuing,” said Gwala.
