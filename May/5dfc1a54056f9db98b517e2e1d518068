MZANSI was stunned when news broke on Metro FM that Babes Wodumo’s ex-fiance Mampintsha had allegedly abused her. During a radio interview with Metro FM presenters Masechaba Ndlovu and Mo Flava on Friday, Babes told shocked listeners of the physical abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of West Ink boss Mampintsha. He responded to Babes’ claims in a statement. “No man has the right to abuse a woman. Like any human being in a relationship, I may have been overwhelmed by emotions and overreacted,” it read. “As for the accuracy of the abuse claims, the build up to the interview, the motive and the timing, that is a matter I will leave to fate. “Nothing is what it seems. Out of respect for the relationship we had and the people who supported us, I have chosen not to discuss the matter beyond this statement.” Yesterday, kwaito musician Mshoza wrote a letter of support to Babes. “I wish I could give you a hug and say it will be fine. As I am writing this to you, I am in hiding because of abuse. The man tried to take my dignity but I managed to find the strength to get out,” wrote Mshoza. “Who do we turn to? I know how hurt you are. Talking about abuse is not an easy subject.” Last week Daily Sun published an article about how Mshoza’s husband Thuthukani Mvula took to social media to reveal how bad their marriage was. Although he deleted the status message shortly after posting it, the pictures were on Facebook long enough for all to see. He boasted about ruining her wardrobe and setting her clothes alight. Yesterday, Mshoza said she has postponed her national tour due to events beyond her control. A new tour date will be announced soon.
