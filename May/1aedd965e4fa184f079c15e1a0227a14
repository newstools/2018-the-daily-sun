A video of news anchor Vuyo Mvoko losing his cool on air, is
doing the rounds on social media. In an interview with Communications
Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, Mvoko was posing questions to Mokonyane, who was in
a different studio in Cape Town and it seems as though they couldn't hear each
other. Moments later, Mvoko can be seen being frustrated by the fact
that the minister was unable to hear him, but he could hear her clearly.
