IF MALEMA had his way, Africa Day would be a public holiday. Addressing hundreds of party members at Jubilee Park in Sunnyside, Tshwane, he said he could not understand why the day was not a holiday. “This day marks the defeat of white rule. People should be proud and not ashamed of being black.” Other African countries such as Ghana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Zambia, Mali and Zambia recognise it as a public holiday. Malema said people should stop calling other Africans makwerekwere. “We should know our history so we respect our brothers and sisters. This land belongs to the San and Khoisan,” he said. Malema said legendary African leaders such as Kenneth Kaunda, Julius Nyerere, Kwame Nkrumah, Thomas Sankara and Nelson Mandela should be embraced. He condemned corruption, brutality, human rights violations and unstable political rule which continue to trouble the continent. Malema also slammed King Mswati III. He said the leader should leave politics and focus on finding more wives. Malema said the EFF planned to change SA’s name to Azania as soon as it became the ruling party. Streets in the country should be named after African heroes. He said they were tired of everything being named after Mandela. He said people should stop giving their children white names and embrace their languages.
