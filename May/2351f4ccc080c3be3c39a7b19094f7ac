HARARE, ZIMBABWE - VICE-PRESIDENT Constantino Chiwenga says he suffers from a skin disease that first surfaced last year. The former defence force chief dismissed claims that his lighter complexion and the pale patches on his hands were caused by the use of skin lightening creams. He said he noticed the problem during last year’s campaign to remove former president Robert Mugabe. “I had a skin disease that affected my whole body. Journalists started saying I was using skin lightening creams but that was not the case. I was sick,” he said on a video clip released by the state-run Chronicle. “We sent everything to South Africa to find out what was causing the illness but they failed to treat it,” said Chiwenga. Chiwenga, who was speaking at the funeral of his sister in the eastern town of Marondera on Tuesday, said he was healed with herbs supplied by a Roman Catholic nun. NewsDay said Chiwenga – who is married to a former model – had recently been mocked on social media. Users called him “Bleachy Chiwenga” and “General Ambi”, a reference to the famous skin cream. –NEWS24
