SUSPECTED illegal miners in Plastic Village, near Main Reef Road in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni have taken gold digging to another level. On Saturday morning, they swapped their spades and shovels for an excavator. But they didn’t get far as they were bust by Ekurhuleni Metro Police and the excavator was confiscated. Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said they received a tipoff about an excavator digging in the area. “Brakpan officers responded swiftly. “On arrival, they found four men, including the excavator operator, digging holes at Plastic Village,” said Kgasago. He said the excavator was confiscated and all four men, suspected of being zama zamas, were found to be South African citizens who live in the town. “They were later released on a warning,” he said. Kgasago said the men, all in their mid 50s, claimed they hired the excavator. “They said the actual digging started on Friday morning.”
