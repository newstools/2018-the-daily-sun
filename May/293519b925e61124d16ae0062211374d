Zodwa Wabantu and A$$Quake kissed and made up at House 22 in Tshwane. Zodwa was booked to perform at the club and was told A$$Quake was in the building and would like to meet her. Before inviting A$$Quake onto the stage, Zodwa said: “Being the strong and powerful woman I am, I will let her be and we will enjoy her dancing, but there’s only one Zodwa.” A$$Quake then walked on to the stage and shook her butt for the audience. When she was finished, Zodwa gave her a big hug. The crowd then started calling her Zodwa’s vice-president. Zodwa was in a G-string and a bra and A$$Quake in a dress showing her bum. When the SunTean spoke to A$$Quake after her performance, she said she respected Zodwa. “What was happening before we met was pure sexism. They like to pit women against each other and portray us as fighting cats,” she said.
