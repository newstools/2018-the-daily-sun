THE three suspects arrested in connection with the violence at the Moses
Mabhida Stadium were granted R1000 bail. A taxi driver (35), rank manager (29) and truck driver (35) were bust on
Monday in connection with the violence after Kaizer Chiefs lost 2-0 to Free
State Stars. Their bail conditions are that they will have to appear in court,
on all specified dates. They also have been banned from attending any sports or
recreational events until further notice. Phelelani Jojisa (34)
who is accused of being among the mob of soccer fans that trashed the stadium,
was released from custody last Wednesday after he made an appearance at the
Durban Magistrate's Court. He has been charged with pitch invasion and malicious
damage to property. In a statement KZN
police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said one of the suspects handed himself
over. Two were bust with the
help of witnesses who identified them. “They were arrested by members of the
provincial task team,” Naicker said. Asked if one of the
suspects was the man who was filmed breaking a TV camera, he said he couldn’t
reveal names yet.
