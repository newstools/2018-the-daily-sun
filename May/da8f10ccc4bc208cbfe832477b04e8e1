EASTERN Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle has come out swinging against municipalities that received bad audits. OR Tambo, Buffalo City and Nelson Mandela Bay are among the top 10 worst offenders. Auditor-general Kimi Makwetu’s report, which was released on Wednesday, revealed that irregular expenditure by Eastern Cape municipalities amounted to R13,5 billion, or 35% of the province’s local government budget. Masualle said the R13,5 billion was spent over a long period of time and no efforts were made to clear the books. In the 2015/16 financial year, the province’s irregular spending amounted to R5,5 billion. Nelson Mandela Bay is the leading offender. The metro racked up R8,1 billion worth of irregular expenditure in the past three financial years. Masualle said:“We are looking at our municipalities’ weaknesses, from the stability of councils to the quality of people who are appointed. “We want to strengthen our system and procedures. A team made up of Treasury, the premier’s office and the department of co-operative governance will go to the affected municipalities. “We are going to work with the auditor- general and these municipalities to ensure steps are taken to attend to these matters.” “We want to make sure there is a very clear consequence management process in place to help us resolve these issues.”
