WHEN Ntombifuthi Mazibuko developed mental problems, she didn’t know she would eventually also lose her sight. However, the 43-year-old from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, feels her disability was a blessing in disguise. She told Daily Sun that between 2005 and 2006 she was mentally ill but it went away when she went blind. “In 2007, I suddenly felt heat while I was walking and a little creature that looked human came up to me. “It closed my eyes and told me I would never see again. At that moment, my mental illness was healed but I went blind,” she said. Ntombifuthi said she tried to get help from sangomas and prophets, until doctors told her she would never see again. “I felt so sad. It was very painful because I didn’t know how I would explain the situation to my kids.” Ntombifuthi said the most difficult thing was starting life as a blind person, but she learned to walk by herself, cook, wash and count money at the Retsohile Support Group for the Visually Impaired. “I also learned to read in Braille and today I can proudly say I am able to do everything by myself,” she said. She now works at the support group doing beadwork and manufacturing cleaning products. She said members encouraged each other to have a positive attitude. Ntombifuthi said when she became blind she discovered the importance of fingers.
