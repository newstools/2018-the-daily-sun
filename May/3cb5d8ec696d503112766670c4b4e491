A 33-year-old Mozambican man was held up by seven suspects who threatened to kill him at a farmhouse in Redcliffe, KwaZulu Natal. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) they arrived on scene to find the Mozambican man silenced with tape and foil. RUSA spokesperson Prem Balram said paramedics removed the tape and treated the man who was crying uncontrollably. "He told Reaction Officers that he was held up by the seven suspects who threatened to kill him. His eyes and mouth were tapped shut and he was dumped at the rear of the house," Balram said. The 65-year-old farm owner who later arrived was then also forced into a shack at gunpoint. She was forced to hand over car keys and she was threatened to be killed. The suspects fled the scene, when they noticed that the male victim had escaped to call for help. RUSA says the farmhouse has been previously attacked by unknown suspects who attempted to burn the house, while a female was inside the premises.
