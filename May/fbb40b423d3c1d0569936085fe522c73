AMAZULU general manager Lunga Sokhela is over the moon about securing the services of veteran goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs. The former Bafana Bafana keeper will be playing for the Durban-based Usuthu in the new Absa Premiership season after he left former Absa Premiership champions Bidvest Wits. The 37-year-old has been tasked with sharing his experience with promising keeper Siyabonga Mbatha, who helped Usuthu finish the season in the top eight. The delighted Sokhela confirmed the good news to SunSport after his team beat Cape Town City 1-0 in their last league game to secure their top eight spot for the first time in nine years. Said Sokhela: “A lot will be sorted out on Monday (today). But I can confirm that Moeneeb will join us next season. The thing is, we had (Boalefa) Pule on loan from SuperSport United and apparently they want him back. We wanted to keep him but due to the circumstances we had to act quickly. So we brought Moeneeb on board.” Sokhela also confirmed that they would start negotiations with veteran strikers Siyabonga “Bhele” Nomvethe and Mabhuti Khenyeza today. “Look, we want to keep them but the decision lies with them. We may want them but they might have other plans that don’t involve us. We will open negotiations with them on Monday. There are also other players we would like keep,” added Sokhela. Usuthu joined fellow KwaZulu-Natal teams, fourth placed Maritzburg United and seventh placed Golden Arrows, in the top eight to make history for KZN in the top flight. But Sokhela said he was not surprised that his team made it. He said: “No one gave us a chance. Many saw us as relegation candidates after we bought the status. “The way I feel after making the top eight is so amazing. This is good for KZN, it is a historical achievement for the province. Everyone at the club is over the moon. We certainly don’t regret buying our status.”
