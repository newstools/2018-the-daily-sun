DURBAN kwaito singer and West Ink owner Mandla Maphumulo insisted in an exclusive METRO FM interview yesterday that he was still in a relationship with Babes Wodumo. Mandla, also known as Mampintsha, has come under fire recently following allegations of domestic abuse. He has been accused of physically abusing long-term girlfriend and gqom musician Babes on several occasions. The allegations came to light during a radio interview with Babes on the station’s The Drive show on Friday. During yesterday’s interview, Mampintsha, who seemed to be ducking questions, claimed another man was trying to steal Babes from him. He insisted they were still in a relationship, despite Babes having said they had broken up. “I love Babes and I will never stop loving her. This relationship was given to me by God and nobody is going to break us apart. People need to be careful about other people’s love business,” he said. When Mampintsha was asked whether he had ever abused Babes, he didn’t answer the question but rather asked the country to pray for him, Babes and their families. Radio host Masechaba Ndlovu called out Mampintsha for not giving clear answers. KZN spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said they have no record of a case opened by Babes. Babes’ manager Keke Mokoena said at least everyone has been given an opportunity to hear what Mandla had to say.
