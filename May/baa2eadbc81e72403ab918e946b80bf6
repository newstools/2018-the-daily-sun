The man who allegedly
assaulted a pregnant woman outside a parking lot at the Featherbrooke Village
shopping centre in Roodepoort, claims he was called a k****r and 'poephol'
(asshole). Romeo Makhubela, a CEO at
Novare Actuaries and Consultants, was captured on camera shoving a pregnant
woman, who was later identified as Bianca Fourie. The company has since
suspended him. But Makhubela decided to
break his silence and issued a statement on Wednesday, saying that he believed
it was important for him to reveal his side of the story. He said he was at the
shopping centre with his two sons to get something to eat at Steers. According to him, the
altercation with Fourie began when she blocked several cars, to the irritation
of motorists behind her. It was at that point that a
screaming confrontation ensued between the woman and occupants of a car in
front of Makhubela, he said. "During this period
the woman was hurling insults at the black occupants in that car. After
parking, my mistake was when I confronted the woman and asked her how she could
hurl such insults in front of children." "What I was not fully
prepared for was that she would turn her rage against me with a barrage of
racial slurs. At first, I was taken aback but, when she unceasingly referred to
me as a 'k****râ€™ and 'poephol' in front of my children." He said the woman followed
them to Steers, where he slapped Fourie after he was overcome by anger.  SOURCE: NEWS24
