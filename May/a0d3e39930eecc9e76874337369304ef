KOKETSO Mashubuku was born with a lung disease. The nine-year-old from Mamelodi, Gauteng, breathes with the help of a machine that has to be recharged. Since birth, her family has struggled to get electricity to charge the machine. Last year, her gogo Sophie Mashubuku (59) decided to move to Moloto Village, near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga. Her mum Tshepiso Mashubuku (29) had to remain in Mamelodi because of work. Despite the move, the gogo did not have a stable power supply. Yesterday students from Tshwane University of Technology came to the family’s rescue by donating a solar panel that will power their home. Gogo Sophie said the power supply in the area is unreliable. “There are constant power cuts so the panel will be our backup,” she said. The gogo said she was grateful to the students. “I had to move from one province to another in search of power, but did not get it until the university came to my rescue. “I hope I’m not the last one they help. “I pray God gives them the strength to help others. “Without them, my life would still be hard.” Prof Josiah Munda said the donation was part of the university’s community outreach programme. Munda thanked the family for accepting the donation. “By allowing us to make the donation, they’ve given our students permission to be innovative,” he said. Tshepiso thanked the university for its kindness. “My troubles are over. I will work hard for my daughter without worrying that her breathing machine could go off at any time.”
