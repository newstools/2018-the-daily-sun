TODAY’S children have access to an amount of information that was impossible to imagine even two decades ago. Erika Truscott, founder of PingMe, said smart devices are part of children’s lives today. “They spend much of their time texting on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. “So it is important that parents are aware of the dangers that go with children being on social media platforms. “Too much freedom and ignorance on the part of parents has resulted in children becoming vulnerable to cyber bullying and cybercrime.” Mzansi is one of the riskiest countries when it comes to children and cybercrime, according to a study by the World Economic Forum. “Just last month, two incidents of planned abduction of children by strangers from shopping centres in Pretoria east went viral.” What should parents do? Is there a way to protect our children from the dangers that come with these devices? Double accounts If your older child is on social media, keep their account on your phone so that you have instant access to chats and posts. Check privacy settings Always set your child’s social media profiles to private. Instal filters Control unwanted content and apps by investing in software that allows you to selectively filter what your children see. Watch WhatsApp Much cyberbullying happens on WhatsApp. You can use the WhatsApp web/desktop application to track your child’s history and messages. Teach them about safety Teach your child that the “stranger danger” rule applies online as it does in the real world. “Remind them to never give out any personal information like a phone number, home address or anything private over social media.”
