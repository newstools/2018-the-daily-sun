THE husband of kwaito star Nomasonto “Mshoza” Maswanganyi has turned to a prophet for help. Thuthukani Mvula claimed that since he found out she had cheated on him, he hasn’t found peace. Daily Sun found him in Malvern, Joburg, on Saturday where he was consulting with prophet Mzozo Bhongolethu. He told the SunTeam he hasn’t been able to sleep at night since their breakup. “I hear things running in my yard like people playing football,” said Thuthukani. “Sometimes I hear rain and thunder, but when I go outside the skies are clear.” He was consulting a sangoma because he never experienced this before their fight. He said Mshoza opened a case against him at the Phuthaditjhaba cop shop in the Free State. “She laid charges of assault, pointing a firearm and intimidation. I don’t even have a firearm,” he said. “I’ve taken the car and phone I bought her. I want her cop boyfriend to buy her those things.” He was due to appear in the Phuthaditjhaba Magistrates Court today. Daily Sun contacted Mshoza on her new boyfriend’s cellphone. She said: “Please tell Thuthukani I’ll meet him in court. “All he wanted from me was to be a celebrity. I don’t have anything to say to the media.” Daily Sun asked if she cheated on Thuthukani, but she said she couldn’t comment on those allegations. “I’m not commenting on anything. I will see him in court,” she said. Prophet Bhongolethu said he’ll go to Thuthukani’s house. “I’ll deal with the evil that’s going on there,” he said.
