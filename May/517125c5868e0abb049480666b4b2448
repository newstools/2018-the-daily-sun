WHEN Thembisile Khoza started feeling sick, little did she know she had a calling to become a sangoma. The 21-year-old from Kumani Village outside Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga had to put her studies on hold to train as a traditional healer. Her mum, Thoko Khoza (52), said they were worried when Thembisile disappeared mysteriously from their stall near Thulamahashe shopping centre, but were relieved when they got a call from her gobela to say she had to train as a sangoma. At the weekend, it was all joy for family and friends when Thembisile celebrated the completion of her uthwaso under the supervision of her gobela. Thembisile told Daily Sun: “I was supposed to write my final N6 public administration exam at Barberton TVET College in June last year. But I couldn’t write because I felt sick. “My family sent me to different prophets, but they couldn’t help. This ancestral calling has been following me since I was little girl.” She said her ancestors came in her dreams and ordered her to do their work, and that’s when she ended up at gobela Khensani Ndlovu’s home. Khensani said she was sitting in front of her indumba when Thembisile arrived in September. “As I was about to offer her a chair, she ran into my indumba and her ancestors came out, offering her uthwaso.” Thembesile said she eventually wrote her final exams and she would be graduating later this month.
