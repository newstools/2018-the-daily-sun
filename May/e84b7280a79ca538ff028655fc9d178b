THE Premier Soccer League has confirmed that Kaizer Chiefs have pleaded guilty to the charges against the club for the Moses Mabhida Stadium violence. Chiefs attended a PSL DC hearing on Wednesday after fans went on the rampage following the club's 2-0 loss to Free State Stars in the Nedbank Cup semi-finals in Durban last month. Broadcasting equipment were damaged during the scenes which saw several security guards hospitalised, eighteen people were injured in the public violence and damage of around R2.6 million was sustained at the venue. On Friday morning the PSL released a statement which reads: "Judgment has been reserved in respect of the sanction in the matter between Kaizer Chiefs FC and the Premier Soccer League following a Disciplinary Committee sitting on 09 May 2018. "Kaizer Chiefs pleaded guilty to the charges of misconduct on the part of their supporters on 21 April 2018 during the Nedbank Cup fixture against Free State Stars FC where their supporters invaded the pitch, assaulted fellow supporters and security officials and damaged property at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban."
