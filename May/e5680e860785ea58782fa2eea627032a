THE late Lebogang Makhetha (59) had two wives and for many years they lived in peace. But two weeks ago trouble started. Lerato Masonthe (22), the daughter of the first wife Mankopane (59), told Daily Sun the second wife Nonpuli (48) came to the house on Tuesday. Lerato said she and her 11 adopted sisters were asleep in a house in Phahameng, Mangaung, when she heard a loud scream coming from the gate. “It was Nonpuli. I don’t know how she managed to open the gate without a key. “She came inside the house and started swearing at us and demanded her husband’s documents.” “We were all shocked. Nonpuli then broke our drawers and took our clothes out.” Lerato said she then called Mankopane, who was at another house. When she arrived, a fist fight broke out. Mankopane said Nonpuli should have just asked for a meeting instead of attacking them. “I went to the cop shop but was advised to go to court to get a protection order.” Nonpuli said: “I never fought with anyone. “All I wanted was my policy documents. It’s a lie that I attacked the children.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sinah Mpakiane said: “We can confirm that a protection order has been served.”
