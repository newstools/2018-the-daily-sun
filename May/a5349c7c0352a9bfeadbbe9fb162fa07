A NEW Zealand gogo bust supplying heroin from her flat in
Australia has escaped going to jail. According to the New
Zealand Herald, Barbara Blewden pleaded guilty to supplying amphetamine and
heroin between February and March 2017. But Judge Kate Traill found that Blewden although she
supplied drugs, it was very little and not for long. Blewden told the cops that the amphetamine she had was
for her personal use. She said that she started taking amphetamines on weekends
when she was about 60. She had no previous convictions, and was suffering from
poor health, including losing her memory. Blewden received a suspended six-month prison sentence. She told Daily Mail
Australia shortly after her arrest last year her terror when the cops
raided her home. "It was just before nine o'clock when I decided to
go down to the shops but when I opened the door police in big jackets and
helmets started yelling at me," she said. "It was very frightening, I just opened the door
then six of them dressed like Ninja Turtles and with guns came in the door
shouting at me to sit down and stay still. "I didn't know what was going on they were all just
shouting. "They made a mess and went through everything and
took me to the police station where I had to sit in a cell for five hours. It
was so cold. "I'm so scared of jail and scared they might make me
go back to New Zealand I haven't been there in over 50 years, I don't know
anyone."
