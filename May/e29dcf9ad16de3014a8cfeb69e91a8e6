THIS car attracts people’s attention wherever it goes. But Metro cops were not impressed when they saw a VW Golf covered with a gazebo in Roodepoort, Gauteng at the weekend. The driver was given two traffic fines – one for not having a number plate and another for his load being too high. Motorists who saw the car parked on the side of the road took photos with their cellphones. Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar, a spokesman for Joburg Metro Police, said this kind of thing was not allowed on the roads. “A load cannot be more than half the height of the roof of such vehicle. “The officers had stopped the car to deal with the high load when they noticed that the vehicle did not have a registration plate as well,” he told Daily Sun. Minnaar said the driver was given two traffic fines. People commented about the car on Facebook. Sir Jez Mukwevho wrote: “I wonder what was written as the infringement on the fine . . . operating a motor vehicle with gazebo. Lol.” Tlou Maluleka wrote: “South Africa could be the richest country in the world – we just have not realised our full potential!”
