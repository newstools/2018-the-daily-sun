BARCELONA’S Lionel Messi says it would be “terrible” if his old teammate Neymar joined rivals Real Madrid in the coming season. Neymar left Barcelona last year to join Paris Saint-Germain in a world-record £200 million (more than R3,3 billion) deal and has been tipped to return to Spain to sign for Madrid. Messi, who spent four seasons alongside Neymar at the Nou Camp, admits he would not like to see the 26-year-old at the Bernabeu. He told TyC Sports: “It would be terrible, because of everything he means to Barcelona. “Every year I fight to win everything. I do not need to go to another team to prove anything. “Ney won important trophies here. He won the Champions League and La Liga. It would be a huge blow for everyone. It would make Real Madrid even stronger from a football point of view.” Messi also discussed his own future, insisting that he does not have to leave Barcelona to prove himself. He added: “I am not tempted to leave Barcelona. I will not be better anywhere else, this is the best team in the world.” Messi and Neymar will be rivals next month as Argentina and Brazil chase 2018 Fifa World Cup glory in Russia. Before that though, Messi will have to watch on as another rival, Cristiano Ronaldo, tries to win the Uefa Champions League for a third year in a row with Real Madrid. Asked about Ronaldo, Messi said: “I don’t compete with him. It stimulates me to see Real Madrid again in the Champions League final, to see them winning league titles. “I want to win the Champions League every year, to be a league champion every year. It’s what we all want.” Asked about the upcoming World Cup, Messi added: “We deserve to be there because of our history, although it cost us a lot in the last World Cups to reach those rounds, but we have to be there again. “It’s more of a desire because of everything we’ve gone through, rather than an obligation. We’re the first to want to be champions in Russia.” – SKY SPORTS
