The
African National Congress has announced that it is set to meet North West
Premier Supra Mahumapelo to discuss a possible end to the protests. Chaos
erupted when service delivery protests rocked different parts of North
West, with residents demanding that Mahumapelo step down as the premier. The
decision was made following the ANC’s National Working Committee meeting on
Wednesday (2 May) in Cape Town, Western Cape. “The NWC
further considered the developments in the North West Province and reflected on
the deep crisis in the NW Health Department and other Departments in the
Province,” a statement from the party reads. “The NWC
welcomed the intervention of Cabinet in the Province which is aimed at
restoring good governance and ensuring service delivery is not halted. “The NWC
recommended that the National Officials immediately meet with the Premier of
the North West Province, who is also the Chairperson of the ANC in the
Province, to discuss all available constructive options to resolve the ongoing
impasse in the interest of the people of the North West Province and the
movement broadly,” said the party.
