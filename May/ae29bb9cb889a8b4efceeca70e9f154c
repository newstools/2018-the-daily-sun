IT is common for most African mothers to carry their babies on their back. This technique has been used for ages and lately, some fathers have been congratulated as being "caring" for doing the same. Now there's a video circulating on social media of an unknown madala using the same technique. But instead of a baby the madala is carrying a sheep on his back while riding a bicycle. The video received mixed reactions from social media users, with some saying it's hilarious while some weren't impressed at all. In the video, a Sotho speaking Madala from Sharpeville in the Vaal is having a conversation with a motorist who appears to have shot the video. The motorists asks the Madala if the sheep is not heavy. The Madala replies that "It is heavy but what can i do....i'm a soldier and I didn't have money to pay for transport."
