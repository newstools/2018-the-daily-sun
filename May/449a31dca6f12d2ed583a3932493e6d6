KAIZER Chiefs’ reserve team coach Arthur Zwane is brimming with confidence ahead of their MultiChoice Diski Shield final against Mamelodi Sundowns’ reserves. The final Diski Shield showdown will take place at Tembisa’s Makhulong Stadium tomorrow (3pm). But before the final kicks off, Bloemfontein Celtic will take on Golden Arrows for the third and fourth place play-off at noon. Zwane says the boys know how important it is to win this title but also realise that it won’t be an easy journey, as they have to get past Sundowns’ stubborn youngsters. “For the boys there is a lot of excitement. They said from the beginning of the tournament that they wanted to reach the final,” Zwane was quoted on Chiefs’ website. Chiefs have struggled to make an impact in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge in the last four years – but in this tournament, which only accommodates Under-23 players, Amakhosi believe their youngsters will be the first to clinch the trophy. “We have spoken to the boys about the importance of winning this trophy,” Zwane added. “We do not have any doubts about winning the match on Saturday. “We have respect for Sundowns. They are one of the best structured development sides in the reserve league. “We are equal to the task, though. We will use the same approach that we have applied in the games we have played so far.” To reach the final Chiefs knocked out Celtic 2-0 in the semifinals, while Sundowns got the better of Golden Arrows, defeating them 1-0 in Durban. Tomorrow Chiefs will be relying on the likes of Yusuf Bunting, Nkosingiphile Ngcobo, Given Thibedi and Itumeleng Shopane for goals. Sundowns, meanwhile, will pin their hopes on Keabetswe Mokoena, Thabang Sibanyoni and Promise Mkhuma, who have been consistent when it comes to finding the back of the net for the club in the Diski Shield.
