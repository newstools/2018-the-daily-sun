“THIS taxi war is finishing off our family!” These were the words of two members of the Nkosi family from Cosmo City extension 2, northern Joburg. They told Daily Sun a taxi war back home in KwaNongoma, KZN, had claimed five relatives’ lives over the last five years. Phumzile (34) said: “The most recent attack left our brother, the sixth victim, in hospital where he is fighting for his life.” She said their father and his brother – who were killed about 20 years ago – were not even among the five. “They had taxis and they were killed for them. Our brothers took over the business but now they are also dying for it,” she said. Phumzile said five years ago, her brothers Thabani and Mthunzi were shot dead while sitting in a taxi. A year later, another brother Mbongiseni was killed while walking in town. Last year, another brother Mphumzeni was shot at and their mum Philisiwe was shot in a car while driving to town. Phumzile’s sister Thulisile (30) said these were not the only attacks. “In 2016, some men came and opened fire on our houses, but fortunately no one was injured,” she said. The two sisters said the taxi business was their family’s only source of income. “If we have to stop this business, we will die. By the looks of it, we have no choice. Either we continue the business and die by the gun or we stop and die of hunger,” said Thulisile.
