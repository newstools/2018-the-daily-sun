ANGRY residents fired shots during a protest on Wednesday after 111 illegal structures were demolished in Parkwood, Cape Town. The violent protest followed the looting of shop and damaging of cars on Tuesday. One protester told Daily Sun: “The City has forgotten about us. “That’s and we decided to build our structures here.” Officials tried to calm the situation down, but the people fired shots and threw golf balls at them instead. One protester said that, now that the City has destroyed and taken their material away, they will fight until they’re allowed to build structures again. Meanwhile, Western Cape Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela had visited the area over the weekend shortly after the residents started building the structures. The MEC had told residents he will meet with the City to find out if land was available. But residents had put up the structures, right in front of the MEC. “They must bring back our material, otherwise this will go on,” said another protester on Wednesday. Wayne Dyason of the City’s law enforcement told the People’s Paper that 111 illegal structures were demolished. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said 15 people were bust for public violence. “Once charged, they will appear in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court. Police will remain in the area,” she said. Safety and security director Richard Bosman condemned the violence. “The City will keep removing illegally erected structures and is co-ordinating with the police,” he said.
