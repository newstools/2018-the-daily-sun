Mzansi people have a way of finding humour even in the most painful situations. On Wednesday, a Lion named Shamba made the headlines after it was killed for attacking its owner, Michael Hodge, 72,over the weekend. Hodge, the owner of Marakele Predator Centre, has "bottle-raised" Shamba the lion since birth. Hodge broke his jaw and sustained injuries to his neck during the attack. But Twitter appeared more concerned with Shamba and has even organised a memorial service for him. Tweeps are also sharing their messages of condolences for the fallen lion.
