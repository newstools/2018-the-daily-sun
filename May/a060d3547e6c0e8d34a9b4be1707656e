THERE was yet another cash-in-transit incident on Wednesday night, but this time the thugs left empty-handed. The incident, which left one man with minor injuries, took place on the highway before the Marlboro off-ramp in Joburg. The cash van was being followed by a backup security van when the thugs started shooting. But the guards were not prepared to give up the cash easily. They shot back and the suspects fled the scene before cops arrived. ER24 spokeswoman Ineke van Huyssteen said paramedics responded to a call and rushed to the scene. “When officials arrived, a man was receiving treatment from other emergency services and it was established that he had sustained minor wounds to his arm,” said Van Huyssteen. “It was found the wounds were made by glass crushed during the incident. “He was rushed to hospital for medical attention.” She said the three other men at the scene were unharmed. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the case was being investigated by the Hawks.
