Hi M izzB I am a 15-year-old girl who has problems at home. We live in a one-bedroom house and my mum keeps bringing different men into  the house for sex. When she has a par tner,we are made to sleep on the floor   but we can hear everything that is going on. How can I stop my mum from having sex in our house? I hate her. Hi Princess Your mum is not behaving responsibly. Exposing you to her sexual activities is a form of abuse. It is important to know that her choices don’t define who you are. Don’t allow other people’s life choices to limit your possibilities. You can choose a better lifestyle for yourself and achieve whatever you set your heart on.
