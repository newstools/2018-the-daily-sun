THE whole informal settlement of Bridge View in Nellmapius, Tshwane knows her and when new people move in they are warned about her. If anyone sees Vinky Nchabeleng walking next to a man, the news spreads that she has found a new victim. But Vinky said the accusations are completely untrue and she is fighting to clear her name. The 33-year-old said at first she ignored the rumours and thought they would go away, but the woman who started it all, her neighbour, kept spreading them. On Sunday, she decided enough was enough and called her family and the community to a meeting. Her accuser was also called to the meeting. Vinky said at the meeting she asked the woman to prove that she was “stealing” husbands and boyfriends. But she failed to do so. “She has accused me of having an affair with her husband and every man on our street. The only proof she said she had was that her husband said I cleaned better than her,” she said. Vinky said the meeting did not solve the problem as her accuser was rude and tempers were high. “She told us that she will only be questioned in court.” Vinky said her name has been tarnished in the kasi. “Her man is unemployed. Who would want to steal such a man?” she asked. Daily Sun contacted the neighbour, Florina Ramakgotso. She claimed that her ex-boyfriend was behind the accusations. “He wants me to fight with everybody here so that I go back to him. It is unfortunate that Vinky was at the receiving end,” she said. Florina said she has spoken to her family and they are planning to get help for her. “That guy has bewitched me, I need to see someone so I can be cleansed.” Florina’s husband said he’s a one woman man and never had any relationship with Vinky.
