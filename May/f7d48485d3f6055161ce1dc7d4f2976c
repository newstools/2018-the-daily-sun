ESKOM technicians came close to being showered with human waste when they went to uproot izinyoka cables in Madelakufa, Ekurhuleni, on Sunday. When protesting residents realised that dancing and chanting would not stop the technicians, they pushed things up a notch. They scooped kak out of their mobile toilets and threatened to throw it at the technicians. Fortunately for the technicians, cops arrived and fired rubber bullets at the residents before they could execute their dirty plan. “They must be grateful they were saved,” said one resident. One resident said the 15-year-old squatter camp was routinely overlooked for service delivery. “Newer squatter camps have electricity, but we are being ignored,” said the resident. Community member Albert Msawope said he needed electricity to run his welding business. “I wish the government would hear our plea. “We do not want illegal electricity, but our circumstances force us to use it,” Msawope said. “Government leaders encourage people to open small businesses but they do not give us the electricity we need to do that.” Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the cables were removed because they posed a risk to residents. “It is unfortunate that the cables were reconnected soon after our technicians removed them.” Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said squatter camps in Ekurhuleni were in the process of receiving proper electricity infrastructure.
