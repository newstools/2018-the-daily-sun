SADTU members took to the streets on Tuesday to express their unhappiness over the Ndumo Police Station. The teachers from Umkhanyakude, in northern KZN, said a colleague of theirs, Xolani Mathenjwa (34), disappeared in March and has still not been found. Protesters claimed that the police had never bothered to properly investigate the disappearance of the teacher, from Ekuhlehleni Primary School in Ingwavuma. Sadtu area secretary Senzo Mbelu (34) told Daily Sun that many teachers in Umkhanyakude were now living in fear for their lives. Mbelu said a lot of information regarding the disappearance had come to light, but the cops did not seem to be interested in following leads. “It looks like people known to be his friends communicated with him on the day he disappeared. Those people might have information as to what happened to him.” Mbelu said the protesters handed a memorandum of grievances to the police. The SunTeam reported on Mathenjwa’s mysterious disappearance early last month. His cousin, Thembelani Ntshangase (29), said he left home to visit a friend on 15 March, but he never returned and his cellphone had been switched off. “The friend said they never met up and that he last spoke to him on the phone, giving him directions.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said Mathenjwa was still missing and anyone with information was urged to contact Ndumo police on (035) 591 0001.
