THE South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has formally announced Abraham
Mahlangu as the new acting CEO. This announcement was made on Wednesday morning, at an MP's meeting in
Parliament. MP's were discussing the social grant payment issue. It's reported that the former interim CEO Pearl Bhengu, asked to return
to KwaZulu-Natal, where she previously served as SASSA regional manager. Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu said the Grinrod,
CPS and Net1 contracts are all linked. "Now Grinrod is charging cash beneficiaries R10. This was
not something we agreed upon, I want to be able to tell the Constitutional
Court, CPS is gone," Shabangu said. "There are people trying to sabotage us, we suspended
the cash payment tender because there were problems with it.  We don’t want to end up in the courts again.
We have to pull up our socks," she said. Shabangu added that they don't want to run SASSA through the
courts, as they cannot continue frustrating the courts.
