THE mum of the young man accused of killing two girls at Hoërskool
Stella in the North West, has defended her son. The 19-year-old appeared in the Vryburg Magistrate's Court on
Monday on two counts of murder. Two bodies of Sharnelle
"Lallie" Hough, 17, and Marna Engelbrecht, 16, were found in their
hostel at the high school on Saturday. As he appeared in court on Tuesday, his mother said her son was
"not a demon". She told Netwerk24 that her only child was "sensitive"
and had a "kind heart". Meanwhile, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has asked for
a full report from provincial heads into circumstances that led to the tragic
killing of two school girls. “It is deeply concerning that our young girls are dying in this
manner. This is truly a tragedy and shows as society we need to work with our
young boys in order to better equip them to effectively deal with relationship
dynamics. “We have seen far too many of our young women killed at the hands
of their boyfriends, or ex boyfriends. It is shocking and deeply disturbing,”
said Motshekga. Motshekga wants provincial heads of department to look into how
the boy gained access to the dormitory. “We need to send out a strong message that the lives of our women
and girls matter. We are not disposable and justice needs to deal harshly with
anyone who takes the life of a woman or a girl in such a senseless manner, as
in this case where the bright future of these two young girls has been
prematurely stolen from them,” said Motshekga.
