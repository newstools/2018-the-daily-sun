THE mother of the girl who sent cops on a wild goose hunt after she claimed to have been kidnapped has spoken out. Makhosazana Bhengu (38), from New Hanover near Pietermaritzburg in KZN, said the first thing that came to mind when she received the message from her daughter that she had been kidnapped was the number of women found killed by their boyfriends. “I wasted no time and went straight to the police to open a case of a missing person as I feared for her life,” said Makhosazana. Daily Sun yesterday reported on the arrest of Sithembile Bhengu (19) who allegedly sent SMSes on Thursday evening to her mum and boyfriend that she had been kidnapped. Police launched a manhunt and after a night of searching she was found at her other boyfriend’s place in New Hanover on Friday morning. She was arrested and charged with perjury. She appeared at the New Hanover Magistrates Court on Monday. Makhosazana, who is five months pregnant, said: “When the cops called me on Friday to inform me that they had found her and arrested her, my blood pressure shot up. I was rushed to hospital where I spent three days. “I was in such shock at such a lie and was angry. This put my life and that of my unborn baby at risk. “I love her, she is my daughter, but she must be punished for wasting police time and causing me pain. If she is punished it will serve as a lesson to other children who might think of doing such a thing in future.”
