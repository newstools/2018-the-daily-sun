NEWLY crowned unified junior flyweight champion – World Boxing Association (WBA), International Boxing Federation (IBF) and Ring Magazine – Hekkie “The Hexecutioner” Budler received a heroes welcome when he arrives at OR Tambo International Airport on Tuesday. Budler went to Tokyo, Japan on a quest to dethrone the local hero Ryoichi Taguchi in front of his home crowd, and it was a successful mission for the South African boxing star. He arrived back from Japan with his team – Colin Nathan (trainer), Vusi Mtolo (assistant) and Bernie Pailman (cut man) – who were equally happy to receive the enthusiastic reception from a group of boxing fans. They showed their admiration for a great performance against Japanese Taguchi. The 30-year-old skilful fighter stunned the crowd favourite with a unanimous points decision to annex all the three belts. Before this contest, Budler came from a controversial 12 round split decision defeat to IBF champion Milan Melindo in September last year. His camp launched an appeal against the outcome of the fight and the IBF ordered a rematch. Taguchi, who beat Melindo in December, inherited the IBF ordered rematch after his victory. Budler said: “It was the toughest fight of my life. But the hard work we put during training made it to be easy.”
