RESIDENTS of Gugulethu, Cape Town, fear their children’s future is at risk. This comes after a community library in NY144 was damaged on Tuesday by suspected protesters. According to residents, the group told staff members to leave the library as they wanted to set it alight. Fortunately, they only smashed the glass windows and door. Resident Sikho Baka (39) said the community is disappointed because destroying the library will have a negative affect on their kids. “I think some of the people who did this did not receive an education because of apartheid. “But now that South Africa is a democratic country, many of us want our kids to study and have better lives than we did. “Vandalising the library used by your child is stupid,” said Sikho. Nomathemba Mashece (30), another resident, said: “My son (7) used to go to the library after school. “It is scary when the places we think are safe are attacked.” Safety and security MMC Jean-Pierre Smith asked witnesses to come forward. “I appeal to those who know anything about this incident to approach the police or the city’s law enforcement agencies,” said Smith. “We want those responsible to account for their actions,” he said. “While staff and patrons were not hurt, the ordeal left them traumatised. “The city has yet to calculate the cost of the damage, but the incident comes at a time when the Library and Information Service has already submitted 110 insurance claims in the current financial year.” He said the claims are valued at about R1,2 million. “This is three times higher than the 58 claims submitted in the previous financial year.” Smith said thieves target libraries and steal “anything of value, from air-conditioning units to computers”. “There is also malicious damage to property. Doors, windows and ceilings are damaged. We are disgusted.”
