THE road is dark and residents cross it hoping to make it to the other side. Kingsway Road in Benoni, Ekurhuleni between Lindelani squatter camp and the neighbouring RDP houses has become deadly since the Ekurhuleni Municipality switched off the street lights. Zodia Mukonde (26) was knocked down by a car on Thursday and was certified dead by paramedics. Residents say as many as five people have been knocked down on the dangerous road. “We appeal to the municipality to bring back the lights,” they said. Joe Sehlako, a motorist, said it was difficult to see people crossing the road as it was dark. “You are sometimes forced to slam on the brakes when you realise there is a person right in front of you.” Another motorist, Koos Botha, said: “People wear dark clothes with no reflectors and it is hard to see them.” Residents said the lights were switched off after they damaged robots during a protest over electricity last month. After removing the robots, the Ekurhuleni Municipality put up stop signs but residents said some motorists do not stop, especially at night. “We are appealing to the municipality to bring back the lights as people are now dying,” said community leader Jan Mthimunye. A case of culpable homicide was opened at Benoni Police Station. Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said they appeal to the residents to look after municipal property and not damage it. “We pass our condolences to the family of the deceased. We are working to find a solution to the problem,” said Gadebe.
