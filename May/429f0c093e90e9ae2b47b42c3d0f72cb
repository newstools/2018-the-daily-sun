US based Mzansi superstar comedian, writer, producer, political commentator, actor, and television host Trevor Noah has had yet another one of his dreams come true this past weekend. The host of The Daily Show recently performed at a packed O2 Arena in London despite the fact that the UK was gripped by the hype surrounding the Royal Wedding. Posting photos of his show on social media, Trevor wrote:  “When I performed my first solo show in London I had 150 amazing people in the audience. “Last night, 6 years later, 16000 people joined me at the O2 arena in London for one of the greatest shows of my life. “Thank you everyone for making last night a dream come true,” he wrote before jokingly adding “and thank you to Megan Markle and Harry Prince, I know you wanted to come but you had already paid for the church.” When I performed my first solo show in London I had 150 amazing people in the audience.
