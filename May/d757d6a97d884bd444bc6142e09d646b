Judgment has been reserved relating to the relief sought by 
Patricia de Lille that she continue being a DA member and fill the post 
as mayor of Cape Town.    "I
 am very happy today that the court heard my side and my version of 
events and that judgment has been reserved for later in the week..."On 
my version I feel that I am still the mayor of the City of Cape Town."     The
 Western Cape High Court has reserved judgment in Patricia De Lille's 
urgent application to suspend the DA's decision to strip her of her 
membership. The outcome means Cape Town will have to wait to find out if De Lille will return as mayor temporarily.      Economic
 Freedom Fighters Western Cape chairperson Bernard Joseph has invited 
Patricia de Lille to join the party following her ousting from the 
Democratic Alliance.                  He agrees with Breitenbach that the City can't go two weeks without a 
mayoral committee.   The sensible thing is to let the status quo remain.             "If possible, could the court indicate when
 it will make its ruling."   The City currently has no mayco.       "But the City can't function without a mayoral committee."       "This is self evident. The mayor is 
the highest officer bearer."
