CHIPPA United are serious about challenging for trophies next season. Hardly a day after their shocking reunion with head coach, Dan Malesela, the Chilli Boys have strengthened their defence with the signing of veteran defender Thabo Nthethe. The 33-year-old nicknamed Mr Cool for being calm under pressure, has signed a one-year deal with an option to renew. The Chilli Boys beat Cape Town City to his signature who were also eyeing the versatile player in a bid to replace Robyn Johannes who joined Bidvest Wits. The soft-spoken player is excited to have started a new chapter in his career having seen little action in Mamelodi Sundowns championship winning side last season. “I am happy to have joined an ambitious club like Chippa United. They are a good side with quality players and I hope to add value to help the club achieve their target. A change of environment is always good and I thank chairman (Siviwe Mpengesi) for having faith in me.” Nthethe joined The Brazilians in 2014 and helped them win trophies including the much sort after Caf Champions League. The defender was also linked with a return to Siwelele, but opted for Chippa instead of returning home to Bloemfontein.
