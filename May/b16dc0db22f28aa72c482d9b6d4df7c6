RESIDENTS of KwaNdengezi, west of Durban, are angry because they’ve had no water since December. On Saturday, they took to the streets. They accused the Thekwini Municipality of punishing them for voting for an independent councillor in the 2016 local government elections. A resident (25) told the People’s Paper: “All areas surrounding our ward have water, but we don’t have any. “We rely on a water truck that comes once a week. “Why are we being punished for voting for a candidate of our choice?” Municipal spokesman Mandla Nsele said he was not aware of the protest. “Most of our units are closed at the weekend, so I can’t give a detailed response. I can only respond by Monday.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “Cops attended to the scene and calmed the situation.”
