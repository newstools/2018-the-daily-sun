THE community of Zaaiplaas outside Groblersdal in Limpopo attacked
and injured a police officer and set alight a police van in a protest. It is alleged that a group of community members went on a rampage and
started barricading the R579 road. "Two police officers were performing their normal duties this
group turned against them, attacked them with various assortment of objects
including stones," Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said. He said this led to a police constable being injured in the
process. The Saps Provincial Commissioner LT. General Nneke Ledwaba warned
the community on the attacks on police officers. He urged members to take appropriate and legal actions to defend
themselves in the wake of imminent attacks "Community members are seriously warned that the police will
take stern legal actions to defend themselves, any other person or property
against these attacks," Ledwaba said. He said community members are expected to support and embrace the
police in their attempt to fight crime rather than attacking them. Ledwaba  further said those
who participated in this shocking act are going to be hunted down until they
are brought to book.
