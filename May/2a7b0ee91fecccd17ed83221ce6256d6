BLACK Leopards put in a clinical performance when they demolished Jomo Cosmos 3-0 in the final game of the NFD season at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. Though Lidoda Duvha coach Joel Masutha was happy with the performance of his troops the sentiment is that Kanana has not been reached. The Mini-Triangular league is to commence on the 16 of May to 2 June which consist of Leopards, Cosmos and the club that will finish in position 15 from the Absa Premiership. The three teams are to play each other on an away-home basis, with the team that finishes at top to be promoted to the Premier Soccer League.Masutha said: “There isn’t time for celebrations as we have not as of yet won the triangular series, and should we not win we would be the same with the team that finished 15th in the league”. There were evident mind games that were on cause between Masutha and Cosmos owner, coach Jomo Sono, with the latter fielding a seemingly weaker side having already secured a spot in the promotions play-offs. The former was however unfazed re-iterating the philosophical thinking of ‘a win is a win regardless of who plays’. With the top flight (PSL) reaching its business end, Lidoda Dovha and Cosmos await to see who is to be their co-cohabitant in the league. With coach Masutha having been there before it remains to be seen if the experience he has acquired is to carry them over the line this time around. Ezenkosi  are no rookie either to this part of the world. This would be Leopards fourth appearance in the promotion play-offs in a space of five seasons with no success.
