POOR students in Nelson Mandela Bay are finding it hard to study because the municipality has scrapped free WiFi at public libraries. Jason Allede (23) from Algoa Park said he can no longer do research because there is no WiFi at the local library. He said: “I need to work on a computer because my phone does have all the features I need. I have to pay a lot of money at internet cafes. Now I submit my assignments late. I am afraid I will fail my electrical engineering course.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “The municipal library services are split into two. Always On WiFi is provided by the municipality while the other service was provided by the National Library of South Africa. It was later handed over to the department of arts and culture. The second service’s three-year tender expired.” Provincial arts and culture spokesman Andile Nduna said: “The department is finalising the new contract to supply free internet to the province’s libraries. It should be ready by June.”
