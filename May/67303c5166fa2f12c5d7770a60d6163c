Joseph “Bomba” Ramosetsana gives the dead the respect they deserve. He sings his lungs out at every funeral he attends, even if he’s never met the person or their family. The 57-year-old from Ga-Rankuwa in Tshwane has attended all the funerals in his kasi ever since his mum died 10 years ago. He’s become a celebrity at both the Mmakau and Kgabalatsane cemeteries. He’s known for carrying a red tin of polish he uses as a drum while he sings. Joseph told Daily Sun he saw nothing wrong with being at the cemetery every week. He said he sometimes attended five funerals in a week. “If I’m about to leave the cemetery with mourners and I see another funeral convoy arriving, I join them,” he said. Joseph said he realised how important it was for the community to support families when someone they loved has died. “When we buried my mother, there was no music at the funeral and that made me sad. I wish there were people who sang for me and my family back then.” Madisha Manaka (30) from Mmakau said when her husband died last year, she was happy to hear an angelic voice sing his favourite hymn at the funeral. Karabo Thage (24), who works at Mmakau Cemetery, said Joseph arrived every weekend at 6am to wait for a burial service. “When I see him I know it will be a great burial.”
