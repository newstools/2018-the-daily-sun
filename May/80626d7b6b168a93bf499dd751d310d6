Free State Stars were crowned the 2018 Nedbank Cup champions after beating Maritzburg United 1-0  in the final at the Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. Goodman Dlamini scored the only crucial goal that separated the two teams in the 44th minute, and his goal will go down to Stars history books as it was enough to see them winning their first ever Nedbank Cup title. Bandile Shandu had a good crack at goal six minutes after the break for United but his fierce effort sailed narrowly wide. Siyanda Xulu missed a sitter for United three minutes before time as he somehow placed his bicycle-kick effort over the crossbar from three yards out as Stars held on for the win and their first-ever Nedbank title. Despite the loss Maritzburg continued dispalying their impressive flowing football which saw them becoming one of the best teams in the league this season, but the Bethlehem based Stars were too strong for them on the day.
