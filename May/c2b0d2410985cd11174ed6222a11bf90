THREE learners from the Sevengwana Secondary School will be
representing Limpopo in the South African Youth Water Prize (SAYWP) National Competition
in Pretoria. The winners will be
jetting off to Stockholm, Sweden to represent Mzansi in the Stockholm Junior
Water Prize (SJWP). SJWP is a Department of Water and Sanitation and the Stockholm
Water Foundation in Sweden collaboration initiative and are held on an annual
basis. The project was launched in 1999 in collaboration with the
Stockholm Water Foundation, the competition begins in the provinces and then
proceeds to national level. The Water Department’s Acting Regional Head, Lesiba
Tloubatla congratulated the winning learners and wished them well, on the
journey of becoming future engineers and scientists. "I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate
Gladwin Ngobeni, Ntokozo Ngobeni and Thanvy Ntibani of Sevengwana Secondary
School in the Mopani District, and their teachers on becoming this year’s
provincial winners. the District of Mopani seems to have more scientists than
the other districts in the province, as they seem to be winning these
competitions almost every year with their water saving innovations,” Tloubatla.
