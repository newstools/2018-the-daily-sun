Former Bafana Bafana and Kaizer Chiefs star Siyabonga Nkosi was caught on the wrong side of the law not too long ago for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol. A video of his arrest recently surfaced on social media and has since gone viral. In the video, the SuperSport analyst can be seen engaging in a scuffle with a female Joburg Metro Police Department Officer (JMPD) who appeared to be recording and taking pictures of him while he was being processed by another officer. However, while many slammed Nkosi’s conduct, some also called into question the officers’ conduct, suggesting they violated Nkosi’s rights by recording and taking pictures of him. One of the videos shows Nkosi saying “Wena, you think you’re bigger than the law. Please take these things (handcuffs) off; it’s my right to have this thing taken off me.” An agitated Nkosi is further heard saying: “Take off this thing. Look what you did to me. Whatever reason, for whatever case you have. For some f**king test or whatever, na leslima ses’febe.” JMPD’s chief superintendent Wayne Minnaar confirmed to TshisaLIVE that Nkosi was arrested on charges of drunken driving. Minner told the publication: "What I can confirm with regards to the video that is out, is that that person in the video is being charged with drunken driving. The incident was on March 26 and that incident was at Sandton Metro police office." Watch the videos below:
