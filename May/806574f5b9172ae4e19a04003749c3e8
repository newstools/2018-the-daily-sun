A GOGO is despairing that her life’s not worth living
after losing her hands and her feet – because of a paper cut. According to The
Mirror, it was in February this year that Marguerite Henderson’s life
suddenly went crazy. The gogo-of-two from Fife in Scotland went to a chemist
because of a small blister that had appeared next to a paper cut on her hand.
She was advised to go to hospital but changed her mind the next day because she
felt too ill to go. Two days later, her son-in-law Sean saw how ill
Marguerite looked and immediately rushed her to hospital. According to medics,
if they’d been just a few hours later, it would have been too late. Marguerite collapsed unconscious at the hospital and fell
into a week-long coma. It was when she woke up from the coma that she was told
the dreadful news. She had sepsis, which is a serious infection that causes
your immune system to attack your body. Marguerite said: “My hands and feet were dying on me. It
was awful, horrific. “I had a full time job, I was out all the time, now
everything has gone. “You take everything for granted and one day it’s not
there.” Two weeks ago, Marguerite underwent surgery to remove her
hands and her legs. When she woke up from surgery, she wondered if there was
any more point to being alive. “I could only move
my head. I thought, ‘what’s the point in me being here?’,” she said. But her family are doing their best to support her. They
have launched a fundraising campaign and aim to buy her a bionic hand,
prosthetic legs, and an electric wheelchair.
