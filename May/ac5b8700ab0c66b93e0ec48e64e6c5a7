FROM 1 July, Joburg’s Metro cops will make use of a four days on, four days off shift system. This was announced by police chief David Tembe yesterday. “We have finally signed an agreement with the unions. The previous shift system was a concern because officers worked 14 to 16 days without rest,” said Tembe. He said Metro cops will now have enough time to rest and this will increase their productivity. “The shifts will be from 6am to 6pm and vice versa,” said Tembe. He said the changes will reduce errors and absenteeism and increase accountability. “JMPD has 3 700 officers and 1 500 trainees. The previous shift system caused unnecessary stress and low morale. “The new shift system will have 900 officers on duty in Joburg. A total of 1 800 will work a 24-hour shift.” Tembe encouraged members of the public to report any officers who are out of line. He said bribes are a temptation that some officers cannot resist. “Weak officers take bribes, but we must also remember that it is the public that lures them into this trap. “Dedicated and hardworking officers will be rewarded for their efforts. “But those who stray from our code of conduct will suffer the consequences.” If members of the public have any queries, they can call the JMPD on 0800 20 37 12. “If this line rings unanswered, it will automatically be diverted to the internal director’s line.”
