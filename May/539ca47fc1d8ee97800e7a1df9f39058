THERE was drama on Monday in the Durban Magistrates Court, where 16 taxi war suspects were due to appear. The docket couldn’t be found and Magistrate Anitha Amu had to adjourn proceedings for several hours. Prosecutor Malibongwe Mhlongo said they were still going over the docket’s contents. The men, and only seven of them, finally appeared after 3pm. Charges were withdrawn against the rest due to lack of evidence. The seven men face several charges including murder, attempted murder, and possession of unlicensed firearms. The case was postponed to 10 May for a bail application. The men were bust on Friday after a shoot-out at Brook Street Taxi Rank in Durban on that day. They’re alleged to have stormed the taxi rank, shot and killed taxi boss Mkhali Madondo (56), and injured his brother Thulani (43) and driver Khanya Dlamini (46). After a twice as dramatic high-speed chase, cops cornered them at a building in Pinetown. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said investigations were continuing and released suspects will be rearrested if found to be involved. Thomas Getsemane, director of Mvimbeni Security, told Daily Sun the suspects, his employees, acted in self-defence. He was in court to support them. He said his men will shoot again if attacked. Asked who had attacked them, he said the matter was before court. “These are not criminals but workers,” he said. “Cops arrested them at my offices. The building where they were arrested is my head office. “Police have no case against them. That’s why there were delays in court.” Allegedly, their aim was to take it over by force from a rival taxi organisation, a new trend almost similar to taxi route wrangling.
