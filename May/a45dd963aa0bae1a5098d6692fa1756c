EVERY morning, Dimpho Dingiswayo prays after she wakes up. And on Sunday, her prayers ended up saving five lives. The 42-year-old from Poortjie, outside Orange Farm, south of Joburg, said while she was praying, she saw a vision of her neighbour’s house burning. “I ignored the vision but then I heard a loud bang. I went outside and saw my neighbour’s beautiful house covered in flames,” she said. “I prayed again and asked God to help me help them. I suddenly got the strength to open their gate and break down their door. “I screamed for help in a voice I had never heard. God gave me this voice, which made everyone come out of their houses.” Dimpho and her neighbours put out the flames with hosepipes. All the family members, a mum, dad, two daughters and a grandson, were taken to hospital and are recovering. “I’m happy I played a role in saving their lives but I know it wasn’t me. It was God,” said Dimpho. When the SunTeam arrived on the scene, residents were angry because they had called an ambulance but it never arrived. Linnah Makhafula (52) said: “The fire engine came when we had already put out the fire. We chased it away.” She said the police only came four hours after the incident but no one was surprised. “We have been deserted in this area. There isn’t even a police station. We do everything ourselves. “If thugs break in, you rely on your neighbours rather than the police,” she said. The family was still in hospital when the SunTeam visited.
