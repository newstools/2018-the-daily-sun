THE SACP has criticised Western Cape health officials for poor conditions at clinics. And the SA Medical Association is unhappy with a parliamentary committee over its unannounced visit to Khayelitsha District Hospital two weeks ago. MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said: “We don’t approve of the visit.” Communist Party spokesman Zuko Mndayi called the MEC and the association cowards who don’t focus on real problems. “A patient disappeared at Stellenbosch Day Hospital and was discovered dead in the ceiling, a newborn sustained head injuries at Khayelitsha District Hospital, and sick people are being sent back home by Mfuleni Clinic and Ashton Clinic.” “These happened without any follow-up or action of accountability by the health department. “Closing GF Jooste Hospital, staff shortages and overcrowding at facilities in poor areas reveal unfair allocation of resources by provincial government.” Mndayi said the situation is alarming and they will visit underperforming facilities.
