CHILD support grants should not be used to buy booze. Speaking in Tshwane on Sunday as part of Child Protection Week, deputy social development minister Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu lashed out at parents who buy alcohol with their kids’ grant money. The theme for the department’s national Child Protection Week campaign is: “Let us all protect children to move South Africa forward”. Bogopane-Zulu said children are being sexually abused by their neighbours, parents, teachers and pastors. “These things are happening under our noses, yet many of us remain silent,” she said. “Albertina Sisulu would be disappointed by what we are doing to our children. She is probably turning in her grave.” She said the law states that child support grants must be used to take care of kids. If a child is living with their grandparents, the grant is paid to their madala and gogo. “Parents and guardians must stop abusing their children’s grants.” Those affected by gender-based related violence are urged to call 0800 428 428. Callers can also request a social worker to contact them by dialling *120*7867#.
