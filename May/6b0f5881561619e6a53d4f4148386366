AFTER 10 months of dominance in the National First Division (NFD), Highlands Park will today be crowned the new champions, after winning  the league last month, with five games remaining. The Lions of the North, who are led by Owen da Gama, assisted by Allan Freese, displayed stellar performances in the league. In fact, they were in a league of their own as they only lost three matches, drew six and won 20 in their 29 games played. Highlands were relegated from the Premier Soccer League (PSL) at the end of last season, but it did not take them long to bounce back into the top flight as they won automatic promotion. They joined Golden Arrows, who won automatic promotion after spending just one season in the NFD. Highlands also broke a record of having gone 19 matches unbeaten in the league, which was set by the now defunct Thanda Royal Zulu last season. In 29 matches that have been played in the league they managed to score a tally of 62 goals and conceded only 13. Today Highlands will wrap their NFD stint with an encounter against Stellenbosch FC at Athlone Stadium, in Cape Town, (3pm). Throughout the season, the Lions of The North relied on a couple of players, who made things happen for the club. The likes of veteran striker Petrus Ngebo, Lindokuhle Mbatha, former SA Under-23 midfielder Mothobi Mvala, and Namibian attacking midfielder Peter Shalulile, have been outstanding. The quartet contributed 35 goals in the 62 that have been scored by the club so far. Shalulile, who did not play when Highlands were in the PSL last season due to knee injury, is on the verge of winning the golden boot. Heâ€™s currently tied at the top of the goal scoring charts with Black Leopards striker, Mwape Musonda, having scored 14 goals each. Meanwhile Jomo Cosmos have secured their promotion play-off spot, they will be joined by another NFD side between Leopards, Real Kings and Witbank Spurs in the play-offs to play for a possible PSL spot.
