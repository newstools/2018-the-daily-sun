Two men were injured during an attempted cash-in-transit heist in Langeloop, Mpumalanga on Wednesday. The cash van was en route to the nearby village of Kamhlushwa when a white Toyota bakkie and a BMW gave chase, police spokesperson Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said. The security guards sped up and collided with a Toyota Corolla driving in the opposite direction.    After the collision, the Toyota bakkie and the BMW, carrying 15 armed suspects, caught up with the cash vehicle and disarmed the security guards. "Their intention was to use explosives but, before they could proceed, they were thwarted by the police," Bhembe said. No arrests have been made.
