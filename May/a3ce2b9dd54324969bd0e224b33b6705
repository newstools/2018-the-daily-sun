She is one of Mzansi’s hottest personalities and one look at her Instagram is sure to leave many in envy. But it seems not everyone appreciates fitness bunny Sbahle Mpisane’s revealing posts on social media. After posting a video of herself in a bikini like she normally does, one of her followers was not impressed by the amount of skin Mpisane was showing and decided to let her know. "I like you as Zulu woman. I really do. But this revealing that you do, always, not in the beach, is just ungodly. Child of God," the follower wrote. However, Mpisane was not about to apologise for flaunting her banging body saying "Unfollow babe if seeing me in a bikini is too much heat for u... I'm not living for u. So what must I wear to the beach?" The Durban based celebrity fitness trainer went on to address all the haters who hide behind Christianity calling them “Judgemental.” "I only reveal when I'm wearing my bikinis so now explain what I must wear at the beach or by the pool side??? Christians are so judgmental, if it ain't godly, then let god be the one to judge not u imperfect human beings. "Now we need to walk around the beach fully clothed because you individuals are uncomfortable! Yall mad, I'll show this week what nudity and trap is!" she promised. Me and my perfectly micro bladed eyebrows ?? A post shared by  FitnessBunnie (@sbahle_mpisane) on May 20, 2018 at 5:11am PDT
