MANDRAX with an estimated street value of R3,5 million was found in a house in Zondi, Soweto yesterday. Members of the Gauteng traffic police, municipal police, Joburg Flying Squad and intelligence unit Prasa saw a white VW jetta being driven recklessly. They chased after it and it was stopped on Elias Motsoaledi Road. “We stopped the car and searched it and ... found Mandrax pills. The pills were in the boot of the car and under the front seat,” said one of the members. Two suspects in the car provided the cops with information on where they had obtained the Mandrax, in Zondi, Soweto. “When we got there one more suspect was found printing the Mandrax from powder to pill. We also found a blender and other equipment,” the cop said. The suspects, aged 62, 31 and 27, claimed they were paid R1 500 every two days and got the powder from a foreign national. They had been running the lab in Zondi for eight months but had started in Diepkloof years ago. Cops found a list of people owing money to the madala for supplying them: “There is a list of people in different provinces owing him serious amounts of money,” an official said.
