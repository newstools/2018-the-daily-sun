TEMPERS ran high at Great Kei Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape on Friday. Samwu members didn’t get their salaries and have downed tools. Apparently, hundreds of municipal workers are affected. Samwu leaders said members got letters on Thursday informing them they won’t get paid because the municipality didn’t have money. Union members have been on strike since 3 May, complaining about: ) appointments of unqualified directors ) unequal salary ) non-payment of staff insurance and pensions to third parties. Samwu shop steward Luthando Juju told the People’s Paper: “On Thursday, we received letters of notice informing us we won’t get paid on Friday. “When we asked about this, we were told the municipality is bankrupt and has no money. “We were shocked because all 11 councillors were paid on 15 May. “They told us we might get our money next week. There hadn’t been proper management of funds since February 2010, he said. “Some of the money was spent on court cases and lawyers, and on bouncers hired to fight striking Samwu members.” He said this amounted to fruitless expenditure. Union leaders and municipal bosses are expected meet with the Eastern Cape Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs. Juju called on the department to place the municipality under administration. Chairman of Great Kei United Forum, Zola Tshali, said they’d asked the municipality how the money was spent.
