MPUMALANGA police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma is serious about fighting crime, especially cash-in-transit heists, bank robberies and ATM bombings. He has put together a special team of cops working under Operation Gijima Tsotsi. The operation is led by a senior cop and is made up of the Hawks, crime intelligence, a tactical response team and flying squad members. The team has already made several arrests in the province. Some 28 suspects were arrested and eight firearms, including five AK 47s, two rifles and a 9mm pistol recovered. The police also found seven luxury vehicles which are believed to have been used to carry out crime. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “The suspects were arrested for crimes including murder, cash-in-transit heists, possession of explosives, bank robberies, ATM bombings, unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. “The other suspects are facing charges of possession of suspected stolen motor vehicles, attempted murder, conspiracy to commit crime, kidnapping and assault of a traffic officer, theft of explosives and theft of cash.” Zuma said it was important for cops to fight all forms of crime. “Cash-in-transit heists and other related crimes are occurring in almost every part of the province. “The perpetrators are daring and always dangerously armed, which is a clear sign that they are ready to kill,” said Zuma. “So it’s important for the community to work with the police and not confront these thugs. “Instead, they should report the perpetrators to the police, who are capable of making arrests.’’ He encouraged communities not to hesitate to report any form of crime. “If we don’t work together, we will not be able to deal with these daring and barbaric gangs. “I have dedicated this special team to deal with the damage already caused, as well as to put plans in place and proactively monitor the activities of these criminals,” said Zuma.
