All three were employees of Platina Mine in Northam and were  found in possession of mine explosives, stop
fuses, connector capped fuses, power gel blasting cartridges, reef master shock
tube assemblies and dura fuse connectors capped fuses. HAWKS spokesperson Matimba Maluleke said that during
November 2008, the Serious Organised Crime Investigation Unit apprehended
Gobakwaoana Emmanuel Molokoane (33), Thapelo Tumela Kekana (34) and Peter Boy
Tselane (37) during a takedown operation in Northam aimed at addressing people
who were dealing with mine explosives. He said the trio were released on warning after their
first appearance last year but the court ordered that they be placed in detention
during the trial until sentencing. Molokoane was found guilty and sentenced 30 years direct
imprisonment for dealing, supplying, possession and theft of explosives, Kekana
was sentenced to 30 years on the same charges whilst Tselanyane received a 15
year sentence for theft of explosives. Maluleke said
HAWKS welcome the sentencing because comes at the time when the province and
the country is experiencing an upsurge in cash in transit heist and commercial
explosives are reportedly being used in a commission of these serious crimes. “It is hoped that the sentences will send a strong
message that joint police efforts are yielding excellent results in ensuring
that those are involved in the illegal supply of explosives go to jail for a
very long time,” Said Maluleke.
