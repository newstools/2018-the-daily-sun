ALBERT Ndlovu lost his legs while working in Botswana and was allegedly never given compensation, which left him feeling troubled. Yesterday, in the early hours of the morning, Albert (25) hanged himself from the washing line at a block of flats in Hillbrow, Joburg. His heartbroken brother, Nkosi Ndlovu (26), said he and his girlfriend were out in the Hillbrow streets after midnight, looking for Albert. “Yesterday he joked about death and asked what we would do if he died. We didn’t take him seriously but look what’s happened now.” Nkosi told Daily Sun his brother left the flat at about midnight and that his girlfriend had looked for him with no success. He said Albert left him a voice message on WhatsApp, but it was already too late. “I was on my way to buy airtime when I heard people saying that someone had killed himself,” said Nkosi. “By then it was about 9am. I went to check and the cops told me the person looked like me. That’s when I knew I had lost him. “The message said he had no particular reason to kill himself or fought with anyone. He said he wanted to end his life like this and we should be okay.” Nkosi said his brother was fine, but was always troubled by the tragedy that cost him his legs in Botswana. “I’ll never forget what I saw on top of that roof. My brother hurt me deeply because we were close. We are going to struggle with money to take his body to Zimbabwe. We will accept any form of help.” Hillbrow police spokesman Sergeant Mduduzi Zondi confirmed that an inquest docket was opened. “We will investigate further. The voice message will be analysed.” It is suspected that Albert hanged himself at about 1am. His body was spotted by a passerby on his way to work at about 5am.
