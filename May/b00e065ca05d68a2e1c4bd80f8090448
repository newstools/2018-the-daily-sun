THE couple seemed to be living the life: both lawyers,
they lived in the upmarket Diamond Estate in Sangotedo, Lagos State in Nigeria. But on Wednesday night the dream died a violent death
when Udeme Odibi (47) allegedly stabbed her husband, Otike Odibi (50), to death
– and then cut his 4-5 off and put it in his dead hand. This is according to Punch
Metro. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Chike
Oti said the couple were not as happy as many thought and had a bitter
three-year-long marriage. They married after Udeme divorced his first wife, with
whom he has a daughter. Udeme and Otike had no children together. Oti said cops were alerted to the tragedy about 7.30am on
Thursday. “Based on the information, the DPO mobilised a team of
detectives to the scene where they found the man lying on the bed in a pool of
blood with his stomach ripped open, exposing his intestines. As if that was not
enough, the killer severed his genitals and placed them on his right hand. “However, before the arrival of the police, Udeme, who
had unsuccessfully attempted to commit suicide after allegedly killing her
husband, was rushed to a hospital for treatment by neighbours,” said Oti. A neighbour reported that Otike had called him a few
hours before he was murdered, complaining that Udeme was threatening to kill
him with a knife. “The deceased also
called his mother and his younger sister complaining of the threat to his life
that night,” Oti added. Udeme is currently recovering in hospital.
