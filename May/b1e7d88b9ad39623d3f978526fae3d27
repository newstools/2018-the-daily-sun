THE People’s Paper has learned that last week’s stabbing at Springs Secondary School was not the first. It has come to light that the school in Ekurhuleni has two groups of pupils who belong to different gangs. According to sources, the two groups have been fighting for territory at the school and are known as the Red Indians and Afguns. Sources told the SunTeam the pupils, aged between 16 and 18, usually start fighting on the streets, but their conflict often spills over into the school. The most recent incident happened on Friday, when knives and scissors went flying through the air as two groups of boys tried to hurt each other. The incident was caught on video and many people who saw it were shocked at the level of violence. It was reported that three pupils were injured during the fight and were rushed to hospital for medical attention. Springs police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said: “We can confirm a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was opened and investigations are continuing.”
