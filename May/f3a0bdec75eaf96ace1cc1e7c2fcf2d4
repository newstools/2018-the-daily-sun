“WE COULDN’T be anywhere but with you today because we believe you’re the oldest person in the world.” This was what Western Cape social development MEC Albert Fritz told Freddie Blom when he visited him on his 114th birthday on Tuesday. Freddie celebrated his special day with family, friends and the MEC, who brought cake. One cake led to many as the party held at his home in Delft, Cape Town grew. The MEC said young people could learn a lot from his lifestyle. “We want to use you as an example in this community so they can live for many years,” said the MEC. The MEC’s spokesman, Sihle Ngobese, said although Freddie’s age hadn’t been declared by the Guinness World Records, they believe he is the oldest man alive. “As government, we wish him and his family well. We continue to encourage greater family and community participation in the daily lives of the elderly, including keeping them in communities.” Freddie said he doesn’t know why God has kept him alive this long as there is nothing special about him. “When they talk about loving God and His grace, that’s what kept me alive. God loves me and I’m thankful for the years.” He said he used to smoke and drink but he stopped years ago. “The only thing I can tell young people for them to grow old is to respect their elders at all times. Then they will live a long time.” His wife Nettie (85) told the SunTeam she was very happy Freddie was still alive as it was God’s grace.
