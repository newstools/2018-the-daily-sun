THE South African Municipal Workers’ Union and the ANC in Tshwane are calling for former City of Tshwane chief of staff Marietha Aucamp to pay back all her earnings since she was appointed. Aucamp resigned on Friday, after news broke of her lack of qualifications. She has been under fire after it came out that she lied her about her qualifications, leading to her being appointed the city’s chief of staff in mayor Solly Msimanga’s office. The advert stated that the job required a bachelor’s degree or a similar qualification. Mayor Solly Msimanga claimed he had no choice but ask her to resign but Aucamp said she did so of her own free will. According to her, he didn’t ask her to resign. Msimanga was criticised by the Tshwane ANC caucus, which claimed he knew Aucamp had no qualifications. Tshwane deputy ANC chairman Mapiti Matsena insisted Msimanga wrongfully sat on the panel which appointed Aucamp and by doing so, broke the rules and regulations about the appointment of senior managers. “He scored her highest. In fact he gave her maximum points. “It is criminal that the city didn’t apply for refusal as informed by the local government act, including the policy of the city,” Matsena said. After the news broke, Twitter users took digs at Aucamp about her lack of qualifications. They posted pictures of their degrees and graduation gowns under the hashtag, #MyQualificationAreLegit. @SP_Manquthu posted pictures of herself wearing two different graduation gowns. @ChristoThurston wrote: “Electrical engineering technician . . . it wasn’t easy studying while being a single parent.”
