THEY claimed they had been using the municipal land in Isipingo, south of Durban, since 2003. They also claimed to have had an agreement with Metro cops to use the land to repair vehicles. But the mechanics said they have now been left stranded, with no place to fix cars, because Metro police closed off the piece of land with concrete and soil on Monday. They claimed this was a breach of their alleged agreement with the municipality. On Tuesday the mechanics blocked roads with rocks and burning tyres, demanding that Metro police reopen the place and allow them to use it, or give them an alternative space. Mbuso Mchunu (37) said they feel abused by the Metro police. “We held a meeting with Metro cops last month because they had threatened to close this place. At our meeting, we agreed that they can close the place but they must give us three months’ notice first or give us another place to use. “We were shocked on Monday when the cops came, put concrete and soil to close it. Fortunately it was still in the morning and there were no customers,” said Mbuso. Another mechanic, Sifiso Zindela (39), said they blocked the road because they wanted cops to realise that their actions had angered the mechanics. “We don’t know where to run our business and it is very frustrating because we are losing customers.” Sifiso said they saw the unused land in 2003 and decided to use it to make a living instead of getting into crime. EThekwini Metro Police spokesman Parboo Sewpersad said: “This land is close to the road, which is dangerous because cars can crash into them. We have been asking them to leave and warned them that we would close the place, but they did not listen.” He confirmed the meeting with mechanics, but said they had not made any agreement.
