CANADIAN cops are investigating after another human foot
washed ashore in British Columbia in the south of the country. According to The
Guardian, this is the fourteenth foot to have been discovered washed up
from the oceans since 2007. A man walking on the bridge of Gabriola Island in the
south of the country came across a hiking boot which contained the remains of a
human foot on Sunday. All the other 13 feet had been wearing running shoes. Nobody is exactly sure what’s going on, but there are
plenty of theories. Some believe the feet are remains from natural disasters,
like the 2004 tsunami that killed more than 230 000 people across 14 countries. Others think the feet may be the remains of victims of
boat or plane accidents at sea. Others believe the feet are the work of a serial killer
or organised criminals. But the coroner’s office has ruled out foul play in
previous investigations, since the feet show no signs of trauma. They believe
the foot became detached from the corpse naturally in the process of
decomposing. Of the 14 feet, eight have been identified and they
included two pairs. The remaining unidentified feet all belonged to men, said
the report.
