THE family of the murdered Mangosuthu University of Technology student Zolile Khumalo (21) has not come to terms with their loss. Her mum, Princess Khumalo (50) from Mpaphala Village in Eshowe, northern KZN, said Zolile was a very intelligent child. “The family had hoped she would have a bright future and did not even know that she had a boyfriend,” said Princess. Her aunt, Khethiwe Ngema (48) said Zolile was the last born in a family of seven children. She said: “At birth her father named her ‘Sthembele’, which when loosely translated means ‘We rely on you’. “Her many siblings had died and her father hoped that she would live longer. She is the sixth child to pass on, as the others died after suffering from different illnesses years ago.” Khethiwe said the family had suffered a lot of bad luck because Zolile’s father was also the only one who survived in his family. “It is still not clear where all this bad luck comes from,” she said. Zolile was gunned down, allegedly by her former boyfriend, Thabani Mzolo (23) at the university’s student residence in Durban. It is believed Mzolo, whom Zolile had recently dumped, was signed in by another student. He appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court on Thursday and the matter was postponed to 10 May. Zolile will be laid to rest at her home in Eshowe on Saturday.
