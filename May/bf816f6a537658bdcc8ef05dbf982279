VETERAN PAC member Michael Matlala was given a memorable send off on Saturday. Members of the party fired shots into the air to say goodbye to the struggle veteran, who died in Orlando, Soweto, two weeks after a short illness. Matlala was remembered by his family as a responsible and strict father. Family member Barbara Mphasane said she was with him during his final moments. “When he got sick I started nursing him. His illness came as a shock because we knew him as a strong man. He was only sick for two weeks,” she said. “As a family, we learned a lot from Michael. His legacy will continue to inspire us. He will never be forgotten and will always be in our hearts.” Matlala, who was 78 when he died, was an active member of the party since it was started in 1958. He was introduced to politics when he went to study at Turfloop University. He later dropped out to became a political activist. He was laid to rest in Ngobi Village, North West, where his family was originally from.
