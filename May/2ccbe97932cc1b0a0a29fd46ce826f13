TWO hundred and fifty bursary recipients signed a contract with Eastern Cape’s Education MEC, Mandla Makupula, on Wednesday. At the ceremony – which took place at the University of Fort Hare’s East London campus – the students committed themselves to using their knowledge to improve the lives of rural pupils. The Matthew Goniwe Bursary is awarded to poor students who want to study teaching. “Once they have completed their studies they will teach maths, science and technology at rural schools for four years. Makupula said: “I want them to go to villages because the teachers we have now do not want to work there.” Bursary recipient Sanelise Sithela (21) from KwaLambathi Village in Ngqamakhwe said: “I matriculated at a village school so I have to go back after I finish this course. I have no problem teaching there.”
