SOUTH African motorists will be punished again in June, as the price of petrol is set to go up by 85 cents to the litre. Diesel will increase by 87 cents, and illuminating paraffin by 82 cents. Commenting on the data released by the Central Energy Fund, the Automobile Association (AA) said fuel prices will hit record highs in June, primarily because of stronger international oil prices. “The rand traded in a fairly narrow band against the US dollar throughout May. However, international oil prices have come under strong pressure, accounting for two-thirds of the price rise which will come into effect next Wednesday, 6 June,” said the AA on Thursday. “The Department of Energy’s monthly close-out happened early due to the public holidays in April, after which the rand lost almost 60 cents against the US dollar in a matter of a day. This meant a substantial fuel price rise was a near certainty from the start of May,” added the AA. The stability of the rand is a matter that cannot be ignored and will come under increasing scrutiny in coming months. “There appears to be some possibility of a lower oil price in the medium term with OPEC countries discussing a production increase. However, this will rely on a stable rand for fuel users to feel the benefit, which is not certain at this stage. We advise fuel users to expect further hikes and continue to economise in all ways possible.”
