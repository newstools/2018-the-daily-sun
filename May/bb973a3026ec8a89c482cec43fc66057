The Provincial Gang Investigation Unit has arrested a
22-year-old member of  Upstand Dogs Gang  for the alleged murder of a 2-year-old boy. The man was arrested at a tavern in Voissen Road Gelvandale
in the Eastern Cape, on Monday at around 10:30. Cops spokesman Col Priscilla Naidu said it is alleged
that on 18 November last year, a 2-year-old boy was fatally injured while a
17-year-old teenager sustained a gunshot wound in the neck in Helenvale. "At about 14:45 that same day, the teenager was
sitting on the steps of a house in Hartbees Street in Helenvale when the
suspect approached from an open field and started shooting at him. "The victim ran into the street and the suspect
continued firing at him. "A two year old boy, Akiem Baartman who was playing
in the street, was fatally struck by a bullet in the head," said Naidu. Naidu said the shooting was gang related and police are investigating
a case of murder and attempted murder. The teenager was injured in the neck. The suspect will appear in the Port Elizabeth
magistrates’ Court on Thursday on charges of murder and attempted murder. The Acting Cluster Commander for Mount Road Cluster,
Brigadier Andrew Louw thanked the community for their assistance in tracing the
suspect who continuously evaded arrest. ‘The community is the eyes and ears of the police and we,
the police need their assistance to ensure that these callous criminals are
arrested and removed from society. 
Active community participation is pivotal in our fight against crime,’
added Brig Louw.
