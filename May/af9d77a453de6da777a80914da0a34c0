TODAY, Thulani “DJ Dash” Mzinyane will start his long walk from Joburg to Durban to raise funds for hungry children. Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, the 32-year-old said he wanted to help children in Durban and Gauteng through his Feed a Child initiative. Although the walk is going to be tough, Thulani has vowed to finish it within two and a half weeks. To ensure his safety on the road, he has hired security guards to drive behind him. “Most of the walking will happen during the day for safety reasons,” he said. Thulani said he would make several stops on the way to make sure he got rest. He said he won’t allow himself to be tempted to ask for a lift as he was determined to walk all the way. He will start the walk in Braamfontein, Joburg, and stop in Vosloorus, Heidelberg, Balfour, Standerton, Vrede, Memel, Newcastle, Ladysmith, Estcourt, Mooi River and Pietermaritzburg. Thulani said he had been preparing for the walk since November. “I’ve been walking around Soweto and walked from Diepkloof to town regularly.” The trip is being sponsored by Chicken Express, Afro’s Chicken, Thule and Go Pro.
