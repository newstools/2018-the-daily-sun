AFTER Ben Thukwane (63) disappeared last Friday, his family went looking for him. They didn’t find him but they found muthi all over his bedroom in the house at Emangweni, Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. It was hidden in the wardrobe in his underwear and even in the mattress. Residents believed his wife, Zandi Tshabalala (60), was behind the muthi and vowed she would not live in the house any longer. “The wife knows what happened to that man. We won’t allow her to stay in our neighbourhood,” they claimed. By Monday, they had chased her away. Four men allegedly kidnapped Ben and a case of kidnapping was opened at Tembisa Police Station. His brother, George Mahlangu, said on Friday they heard armed men in a Toyota Condor had come to the house to kidnap him. “His wife was home when it happened but she tells us she didn’t hear anything when he was screaming for help. “Why didn’t she hear anything?” asked George. “We heard she left the house soon after the car had driven off.” George said neighbours tried to help Ben but the men shoved him into the car and raced off. The shocked family invited the neighbours to come and see what was happening and the muthi was laid out on the carpet outside the house. Zandi said she has nothing to do with the muthi and had opened the kidnapping case because she was worried. She said she did hear noises outside and tried to chase the car but it got away. Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha confirmed a case of kidnapping was opened and said cops are investigating.
