SOMIZI Mhlongo will be back on the Samas stage this year. The spicy entertainer will host the main awards ceremony, which will be broadcast live. Somizi, a well-respected choreographer, television presenter and radio host, has become very popular. He will be joined by fellow radio star and reality TV princess Dineo Ranaka and comedian Mpho Pops. The three presenters all have different strengths and will be sure to complement each other on the night of the awards. Dineo, who will be presenting for the very first time, told Daily Sun: “I’m humbled and excited. I feel super blessed. “I’ve spent many years watching everyone take to the Sama stage and do an incredible job. Now it’s my turn. Being on that platform with Somizi and Mpho is amazing. The nerves are there but I’m excited.” When asked what people could expect from her on stage, she said she would go in the direction her spirit led her. “I will embrace the format of the show and who I am. It will be the best of Dineo,” she said. She wished all the nominees the best of luck on the big night. Recording Industry of South Africa CEO Nhlanhla Sibisi said: “We believe Somizi, Dineo and Mpho will hit all the right notes and leave us entertained.” The ceremony will take place next Saturday and will be broadcast live on SABC1 from 8pm.
