Shock and sadness were at the heart of condolence messages circulated on Monday, after the parents of struggle veteran and education expert Graeme Bloch were found murdered in their home in Mowbray, Cape Town. Rosalie Bloch, 84, and Aubrey Jackson, 94, were found tied up and murdered in their Victorian double-storey home in the quiet suburb on Saturday, May 5. The murder has left the leafy suburb reeling. It is one of Cape Town's safest suburbs, based on recent crime stats. Mayor Patricia de Lille and talk show host Redi Tlhabi also tweeted their condolences on Monday.       Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said detectives were following up leads and crime scene experts were combing the scene for clues. The suburb falls under the Mowbray police station.
