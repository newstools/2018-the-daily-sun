Pressure is mounting from within his own party for convicted women beater Mduduzi Manana to resign as MP and African National Congress national executive committee member. The ANC Youth League (ANCYL) in a strongly-worded statement on Wednesday called on Manana "to follow his conscience and do the honourable thing, and resign from his positions in the ANC and Parliament". This as Minister in the Presidency Responsible for Women and ANC Women's League president Bathabile Dlamini denounced "any form of violence against women under whatever circumstances". In September last year, Manana was convicted on three counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm after he pleaded guilty to the charges. The charges relate to the assault of three women at Cubana in Fourways, on August 6, 2017, which was filmed and went viral on social media, sparking a national outcry for his arrest. In the latest incident, it is alleged that Manana shoved his 53-year-old domestic worker, Christine Wiro, down the stairs over the weekend. Charges were initially laid, but were later withdrawn. 'Barbaric and inhumane' Manana said on Monday that he intended laying a complaint against the domestic worker for allegedly trying to extort R100 000 from him. "The new allegations levelled against me are both unfortunate and malicious," he said in a statement. TimesLive reported on Tuesday that a recording emerged in which Manana allegedly offered his domestic worker R100 000 to drop the charges. The ANCYL said it "wishes to join many leading South African voices in condemning the unrepentant behaviour of Manana". "Manana's behaviour or actions are not only in direct opposite of the ANC's values, principles and revolutionary morality, but they are unjustifiable, barbaric and inhumane," reads ANCYL spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize's statement.
