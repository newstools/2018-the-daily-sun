ISAAC Makhura said his love of filmmaking started when he was a teenager. The 39-year-old from Diepsloot, Joburg told SunBuzz: “I fell in love with filmmaking at high school and since then, I have never looked back. “I chose filmmaking because I enjoy telling stories about our African culture.” Isaac is the director of Diep-Stars-Production and Express TV. His companies specialise in TV and video productions. Isaac said he and his team recently shot a film called Lost in a Mission. “But the movie failed to make the grade on Mzansi Magic because of its poor sound quality,” said Isaac, who is also a graphic designer. “After that project failed, we shot seven films and sold copies at taxi ranks to put food on the table.” Last year he worked with Xivono Afri Film and Born Talented in Pain Love. “The film was nominated for the Joburg leg of the 48 Hour Film Project, but we didn’t win,” Isaac told SunBuzz. He said he was shooting his new film, Never Again, which will be released later this month.
