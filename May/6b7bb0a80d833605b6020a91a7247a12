ANNA Khoza (46) says she is haunted by the screams of her brother, Joseph Sithole. After Joseph (20) fell into a disused mine shaft in Evander, Mpumalanga, three weeks ago, cops keep saying they are waiting for the rescue team! “Every day I am haunted by his screams, especially at night. I don’t know who will take him out. I see him in a hole holding out his hand for me to take him out but I can’t,” said Anna with tears in eyes. “It hurts because he’s my only brother and I look up to him to fend for this family.” Anna, from Langaville in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun her brother left with his friends to look for a job but didn’t say what kind of work he was looking for. “Five days after he left, I tried to call him but his phone rang unanswered. “I got worried and tried to find out where he was. I learned he had gone to a mine in Mpumalanga to go dig gold with his friends. “ They told me he missed a step and slipped right back in while trying to get out,” said the devastated Anna. She said she reported it to the police in Evander. “I was told we will have to wait for a mine rescue team,” she said. Warrant Officer Kris Botha said they were waiting for the rescue team. “Officials went there and found the shaft is about 2 000 metres deep,” he said. Mineral resources spokesman Nathi Shabangu said they will have to speak to the regional office to see what steps to take.
