Black Leopards are back in the Absa Premiership! The Limpopo based outfit confirmed their spot in the top flight for next season after defeating Jomo Cosmos 1-0 in their last play-offs match which took place at Thohoyandou Stadium on Wednesday afternoon. Karabo Tshepe scored the most important goal which ensured Lidoda Duvha gain promotion in the 26th minute of the first half when he finished off a perfectly weighted pass from Joseph Mhlongo. The victory saw Leopards sitting at the top of the three teams mini-league with an unassailable eight points and booked their spot in the PSL for next season. Cosmos are going back to the NFD where they will be joined by Platunum Stars and Ajax Cape Town who are coming from the top flight. This was Cosmos first time failing to win promotion via play-offs. After failing three times in four seasons Leopards never showed any signs of giving up and now they are reaping the rewards. In the top flight they join Highlands Park who won the automatic promotion after winning the NFD in April.
