A WOMAN who was two-timing her lover sent a fake kidnapping message to her mum and her other boyfriend. The message read that she had been kidnapped by four unknown men while at Shiyane area in New Hanover last Thursday. What the woman (19) from New Hanover in the KZN Midlands didn’t bargain on was her worried mum rushing to the police to open a missing person’s case. KZN cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said police searched for the woman through the night, but to their surprise realised there was no kidnapping. They found the woman at her other boyfriend’s place the following morning. “She was sitting with her boyfriend when the police found her. We then arrested her and charged her with perjury,” said Mbhele. The woman appeared in the New Hanover Magistrates Court yesterday. KZN acting provincial commissioner Major-General Bheki Langa said: “A lot of manpower and physical resources were used after the case was opened. “This arrest will serve as a wake-up call to all those who think of opening false cases.”
