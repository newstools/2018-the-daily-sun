And now Katekani Nyambe is going to keep doing what he does best – selling atchaar – as the humble relish in the end helped him graduate too! After matric, Katekani from Giyani in Limpopo, didn’t have money to study but struck on a bright idea to raise funds. He started selling atchaar on the streets and at traffic lights and went from house to house. Next he managed to pay for his registration and studies. And on Monday his dream came true when he graduated with a national diploma in operations management. “I’ll never stop selling my atchaar because people love it and it made me who I am today,” he said. “I’m happy that I’ve achieved my goal. I thank everyone for supporting me and buying my atchaar.” Social media users congratulated the young man on a job well done. Tembisa Café: “We once shared a tweet about you in suits selling atchaar, and now to see you graduating is a big achievement. Congratulations. May you now use the same knowledge to build an empire. We wish you the best with all your endeavours. Continue to shine.” Lucky Kayser: “One can never get tired of seeing a black child progress in life. Congratulations!”
