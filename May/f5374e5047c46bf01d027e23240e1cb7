THE pastor of the Living Word Revival Ministries said the theft of their musical instruments was a huge blow to them. Pastor Kaizer Marokane, whose church is based in Tswaing in Tshwane, said his church is known for beating demons out with drums and other loud instruments. Some residents have complained to Daily Sun about the noise levels and said it disturbed their peace. On Thursday, the church was broken into and the thugs allegedly made off with an amplifier, speakers and other smaller items. Speaking to Daily Sun, Marokane said the thugs hit the church twice in a space of two weeks. “The damage is estimated to be about R12 000. We reported the matter to the cops but nothing has been done. They didn’t even bother to take fingerprints,” he said. Asked about the residents’ complaints, Marokane said they haven’t been approached by anyone. “If people have a problem they should approach us. We are open for discussion.” “We’re not a tavern. We’re here to praise God, save lives and not destroy them,” said the pastor. Captain Steven Maluleke of Rietgat Police Station said they would investigate the matter.
