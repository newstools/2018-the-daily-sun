LIVING in tents in rainy and cold weather is unpleasant. Yet this is the situation people at Boschoek farm, near Rustenburg in North West, live in. The residents of plot 99 claim not to have had water since 2011. They survive on a water tank provided by the Rustenburg Local Municipality. Speaking to Daily Sun, the disappointed residents said they had tried everything possible to get help from government to no avail. Maria Rakuba (55) said she has been living in a tent for the past six years. “I have been living at the plot for the past 22 years and my tent, which I share with my partner, is worn out and does not even close any more. “When it is raining the water just comes in,” she said. Most of the residents at the farm are unemployed and have no electricity. “We’ve written letters, marched and even protested, but still nothing has happened. “All we get is tear gas and rubber bullets from cops,” said one resident. The residents claim the Rustenburg Local Municipality is refusing to make good on a promise it made to provide them with houses. Rustenburg Local Municipality spokesman Andrew Seome said the matter was being investigated.
