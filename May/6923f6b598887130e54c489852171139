WHILE waiting to find out who dug up Kleinboy Motholo’s grave, his family performed rituals on Saturday. Daily Sun reported that since graves were found destroyed by a tractor last Sunday, police have been guarding the cemetery and Joburg City Parks visited the site. The family introduced Kleinboy’s long-lost son, Boy Boy Moloi (64) to him at Precast Cemetery in Lenasia. Kleinboy’s granddaughter Sylvia Ndalammbi (38) said the family was very happy to introduce Boy Boy to his father, who died in 1966. “My uncle was reunited with us last month after being missing for over 50 years. When my madala died, Boy Boy was taken away by his mum, who had separated from my madala,” she said. “For all these years, Boy Boy was looking for his family and when he finally found us last month, we decided to have a ceremony at the gravesite,” she said. Finding the grave vandalised, the family decided to still carry on with the ceremony. “We slaughtered a sheep and brewed our traditional beer. The elders spoke to Kleinboy and introduced him to Boy Boy,” she said. Sylvia said everything went well, showing the ancestors were happy. Family member Jacob Mathole (70) said after finding Kleinboy’s remains scattered outside the grave, they collected them, put them back in the grave and covered it. Captain Hector Netshivhodza said a case of violation of graves is being investigated. Joburg City Parks spokeswoman Jenny Moodley said they are aware of the vandalism and are working with the cops to find a way forward.
