Nearly 400
000 foreign nationals are staying in the country illegally. This is
because they are failing to depart from South Africa after the expiration of
their visas. Furthermore,
the number of illegal immigrants appears to be increasing annually since 2015. This was
unearthed through the DA parliamentary questions to the Home Affairs Minister,
Malusi Gigaba on Thursday. Archibold
Figlan, DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Home Affairs said:  “The questions has revealed  a year on year of increase 16,83% and 11.55%
respectively since 2015 in the number of foreign nationals failing to depart
from South Africa after the expiration of their visas.” Figlan said
in 2015,  approximately 295 000 people
stayed in the country once their visas have expired, this number increased to
roughly 345 000 in 2016 and increased again to 384 000 in 2017. “Not only is
the ANC government failing in its responsibility to curb illegal immigration
but it also continuously fails illegal immigrants who want to be processed but
can’t because of the continued failings of the Department of Home Affairs to
efficiently process applications,” added Figlan. In addition
to this, Figlan said the party has previously urged the Department of Home
Affairs to prioritise in securing borders, making it almost impossible for
people to enter the country illegally. Also to
ensure stronger actions are taken against those who employ illegal immigrants. While
addressing corruption, inefficiency, capacity constraints in the administration
process for refugee or asylum seekers.
