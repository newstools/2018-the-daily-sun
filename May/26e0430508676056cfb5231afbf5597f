THE ANC in the Western Cape yesterday said they still recognised Patricia de Lille as Cape Town mayor. ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs, said they viewed the DA’s “De Lille clause” as a violation of both the city council’s independence and executive mandate of elected officials, as chosen by the people of Cape Town. The ANC’s election head, Zizi Kodwa, Western Cape leader Ebrahim Rasool, Councillor Xolani Sotashe and Jacobs labelled the move to oust De Lille as racist. It said it would plunge Cape Town into a free fall. Jacobs aid the city proposed an increase in water tariffs, despite under spending of the budget. He said R1,2 billion which was meant to deal with infrastructure, informal settlements and other things, had not been spent. “That is a crime. It’s not as if the city doesn’t have informal settlements. We have 400 of them,” said Jacobs. Sotashe said it was a disaster affecting service delivery. He asked national government to place the city under administration. “There’s serious uncertainty in terms of staff. The morale is down, and they are unable to bring services to our people due to the crisis. “Officials in the city are confused as to which official to report to. The second example is the fight between Siqalo and Mitchells Plain residents. Did you see the city officials there? “They weren’t there and we had to step in. The issue of service delivery is being compromised by the instability in the city,” Sotashe said.
