A 24-YEAR-OLD was killed on Saturday at a tavern where he was deejaying in Asanda Village, Strand. Apparently, Siyabulela Khuphiso went to the toilet after his set, where he met his killer. His mum, Nomalungelo Khuphiso from Nomzamo, said: “No one from where he was playing has come to explain what happened. “I want to know what happened to my son.” She also wants Siyabulela’s girlfriend, who apparently was with him at the time, to explain. The broken mum said: “He loved me very much and showed me that. It is painful to accept he is no more.” Siyabulela’s gogo Lina Phoso was shocked. His brother Luphelo (18) said: “He dreamt of playing at popular places and being well known for his mixes.” Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “Police were called to attend to a stabbing at a tavern. “A murder docket was opened.” If you have information, call Constable Mfundo Soyiyo at 021 845 2060 or 082 522 1208.
