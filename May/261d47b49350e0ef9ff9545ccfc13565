TWO suspects were bust and a stolen Isuzu truck recovered with goods to the value of almost R1 million. The driver of the stolen truck told the cops that he was going to leave with the truck in the morning. As he was sleeping at the Depot in Burman Road Deal Party and when he woke up he realized that the truck was missing. "The truck was loaded with nappies and toilet paper. Â He reported this to 10111 and the Port Elizabeth Flying squad and K9 immediately followed up on information. Whilst on patrol in Ferguson Road New Brighton the truck came towards them and stopped," Captain Sandra Janse Van Rensburg. It's reported that two suspects jumped out of the truck and ran away, and then the cops gave chase on foot and successfully arrested both suspects. The Eastern Cape Provincial Commissioner Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga said the successful arrests shares how their strategic deployment of resources in the Nelson Mandela Municipality and surroundings is helping eliminate the space for criminals.
