SATURDAY’S horse racing showdown, the Intercontinental Village Day, will see the track left in a sorry state with super fast horse, Taking The Peace, set to take centre stage at the Turffontein Racecourse in Joburg. The reigning Fillies Classic and Fillies Guineas winner is expected to turn the sod like no other horse as she guns for the Triple Tiara to cement her superiority in the series. Winning the first two legs will surely put Taking The Peace under some serious scrutiny from the other two three-year-olds. And if she did it twice with the same jockey, Callan Murray, what would stop her from turning her feet faster than any of her competitors this time around, and claim the last leg? Speaking to SunSport at the North Rand Training Centre in Randjiesfontein, assistant trainer Mathew de Kock said they have raised their hopes very high for this last leg, which might make punters’ decisions easier than usual. “Although she is jumping from Gate 14, which is not a good spot, she has managed to come from behind and finish first in other races. “This is what’s making us confident going into this last leg,” said De Kock. Murray agreed that all is set for Taking The Peace: “I am physically fit and everything went smooth coming into the race. And I take pleasure in Taking The Peace’s previous wins in the first two legs of this three-series. She has been working hard so I’m positive about this upcoming race.” There are 25 double tickets to be given away!
