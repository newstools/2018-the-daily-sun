THE drama surrounding Afro Worldview, formerly ANN7, seems to be endless. According to sources, deputy editor of current affairs Mfundo Mabane seems to have more authority than current affairs editor Mpho Sithole. It’s rumoured that whenever Sithole issues an order, business owner Mzwanele Manyi overrides and belittles her. “But when Mabane wants to implement changes, she receives support from Manyi,” the source said. It’s also alleged that Mabane is allowed to change show schedules whenever she wants. According to the source, an interview with Kenyan professor Patrick Lumumba was recently aired for three hours. “It was boring. It lasted three hours. It was also repeated four times in a week, killing other people’s stories,” said the source. There was another recent incident in connection with the airing of the first episode of Open Files, an expose of how funeral companies were involved in burying liberation fighters in mass graves. The show was set to be repeated on the day after it was first aired last week but this never happened. “The PAC comrades were waiting for the show,” the source claimed. “PAC president Narius Moloto was featured and we had interviewed him in the studios. “He and many others waited but it never happened. The MK comrades also waited.” The team who worked on the documentary were fuming when Daily Sun called. “We don’t know what happened. Call the station,” said a staff member. Two days after Daily Sun emailed an inquiry, AfroVoice marketing director Gugu Masinga still refused to comment on the issue. “These allegations are rubbish. There is no comment from us,” she said.
