EDWARD Zuma has changed his mind and is ready to apologise to Mzansi for his hate speech. The son of former president Jacob Zuma has reached an out-of-court settlement with the SA Human Rights Commission that he will issue an apology and pay R60 000 for calling ministers Pravin Gordhan and Derek Hanekom “sell-outs” last year. The court ordered that the apology be issued within seven days after yesterday’s court ruling. The money will be split between Umthombo Secondary School in Howick and Ohlange High School in Inanda, two KZN schools in need. Edward initially opposed the application, which was launched by the SA Human Rights Commission in the Equality Court in Durban. He could not be reached for comment as his phone rang unanswered and he did not respond to a text message sent to his phone. The commission had wanted him to pay R100 000 for his comments, made in an open letter he penned in July. He called Hanekom an askari. “No better than a vile dog” he said. He called Gordhan a racist. He said Gordhan viewed black people as nothing more than “k*****s.” He called Gordhan one of the most corrupt cadres of the ANC. He said: “Gordhan thinks African natives are no better than just being sugar cane cutters who must be forever subservient to a master like him for sustenance.” He said: “Gordhan wanted natives to be perennially marginalised and always eat leftovers dished out by Indians and white minority and capitalist network.” Magistrate Irfaan Khallil warned Edward that should he fail to comply with the terms of the agreement, the commission has a right to take action against him.
