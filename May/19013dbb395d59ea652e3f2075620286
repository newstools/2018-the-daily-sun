MANY mums give kids up for adoption for various reasons. When Kholofelo Mashangoane (25) was born in 1993, her biological mother gave her away. Kholofelo from Serala View in Polokwane, Limpopo, was told her mum had another kid who was five months old. “Apparently, she couldn’t afford taking care of both of us,” she said. Muriel (64) and Albert Mashangoane (80) adopted her when she was only five months old. “They loved me and treated me like their own daughter,” she said. “I’m glad they adopted me because they gave me a chance in life,” she said. “When God has a plan, all will be possible.” Kholofelo grew up thinking her adoptive parents were her real parents. “They broke the news when I was 18,” she said. “I couldn’t believe it. Their love was unconditional. I’ll forever be grateful.” She wants to start an organisation that will honour adoptive parents. She wants to start off by hosting a fund-raising dinner and send her parents on a weekend getaway. “I will donate the rest of the money to an orphanage in Polokwane,” she said. “I’ll also go around teaching people about the importance of adoption and how those who were adopted can deal with and accept the truth when they find out.” She asked all those who were adopted to join her group by emailing her onkholofelothos247@gmail.com
