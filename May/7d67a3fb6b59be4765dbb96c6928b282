When me, my father and my mother moved to South Africa from Angola after my father’s 14 year long exile, we lived right where this car is parked. My grandmother’s home in Meadowlands, Soweto is where most of my dreams where engineered. Her garage was our home for 5 years, where myself and my parents slept, ate, bathed and dreamt of greener pastures. Today I parked my whip in that very garage, dreams still being engineered. The reality of my dreams is the product of my grandmother’s prayers. Felt great to be back home ?????? A post shared by  Priddy Ugly (@priddy_ugly) on May 6, 2018 at 1:55pm PDT
