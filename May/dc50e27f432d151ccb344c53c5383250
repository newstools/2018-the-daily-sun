REVEREND Mbuedzedzo Netshiozwi of the Jesus Fellowship Church is passionate about education. He regularly comes up with ways to assist pupils in Vhembe. The leader of the church at Tshilungoma, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, is a former curriculum advisor for the district’s department of education. His latest programme is called Jesus Fellowship Church in Education and intends to help grade 12 pupils choose the right career paths and find bursaries. At the weekend, the man of God invited hundreds of pupils to his church. They interacted with representatives from various colleges and government departments. He said pupils were taught how to apply to study at colleges and universities as well as for jobs, learnerships and internships. Netshiozwi said during the apartheid times, the slogan was freedom first, education later. “Now that freedom is here, the youth needs to prioritise education. “We want them to focus on education in order for our hard fought freedom to be meaningful,” he said. Netshiozwi said the project was bearing fruit as two of their pupils passed their matric exams with distinction last year. Gideon Ramulifho of the district’s education department told pupils their future was in their hands. He said all they needed to do was to work hard and make the right choices so they didn’t have regrets later in life. Nzumbululo Hamisi (18), a grade 12 pupil at Mukhwantheli Secondary School, said: “We learnt a lot and one thing that made me extremely happy was the interaction with the experts from various institutions. “The knowledge I got here will help me plan for my future.”
