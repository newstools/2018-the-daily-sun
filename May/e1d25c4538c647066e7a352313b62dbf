GOGO Betty Mawela said she cannot do her ancestors’ work because she doesn’t have her own house. The 95-year-old gogo from Somaphepha Village outside Middelburg, Mpumalanga told Daily Sun she has been waiting for an RDP house for a long time. She is a traditional healer and said this is delaying her work of healing people. “I am unable to do my work because I need to build an indumba inside my yard. “But as I don’t have a yard or house of my own, I can’t do what my ancestors called me to do.” She said while waiting to get a house from Steve Tshwete Municipality, she has been living in a yard that was previously used for community projects. “It’s been five years now since I’ve been living here and that’s a long time. My ancestors instructed me to build my indumba here and to start working as a traditional healer. “I stopped working since I moved to this area after retiring from farm work. “I have been on the waiting list for too long now and my spirits instructed me not to move again. They want a house to be built in this yard as it isn’t being used.” Steve Tshwete municipal spokeswoman Prudence Magutle said elders like the gogo are a priority and as soon as the first allocation is made, gogo will get her house. She said gogo’s name is already on the waiting list and that she can rest assured she’ll receive a house. Magutle said gogo will get her house soon, although she cannot guarantee that it will be built where she is living now.
