Sandile Mantsoe has been found guilty of killing Karabo Mokoena. He has been found guilty on all three charges including murder, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. Acting Judge Peet Johnson delivered his judgment on the murder trial of Mantsoe in the South Gauteng Court on Wednesday. The defence made an unexpected move on Monday and closed its case without calling any witnesses to testify. The Judge started by saying there is no direct evidence that Mantsoe assaulted Mokoena. He said it is hearsay evidence. He also said there is no direct evidence that Mantsoe killed her. However, Johnson said Mantsoe showed no remorse when telling people he didn't know where Karabo was and also made it seem like he was also looking for her. The court found that Sandile carefully planned the disposal of her body and judge said there is no doubt that Mantsoe burnt the body to cover his tracks. Judge Johnson said the deceased is not alive to tell her side of the story or verify the hearsay evidence of the alleged assault inflicted by the accused. He said that as far as evidence of investigating officer Captain Mhlongo is concerned Mantsoe was a calm witness and so it's highly unlikely that the captain would want to falsify the evidence and implicate him. The judge also rejected Mantsoe's evidence that he was not read his rights during the arrest and that Captain Mhlongo had tried to solicit a bribe from him. He said this claims are fabricated and added that Mantsoe is not a reliable witness.
