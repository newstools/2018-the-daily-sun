Mzansi's internationally-renowned DJ posted a picture of himself on Instagram with a jet that has his name on it. The jet is branded “Black Coffee”, with a Mzansi flag underneath his name. His caption read: “The European/US Summer is beginning and I’m so excited and grateful to be able to travel the World, share Music, Joy and Love, one day at a time. “I’ve been pursuing my dream to make, play music and to share it with people of all religions, races, colour or creed all over the World. “My feeling has always been that Love has no boundaries, no borders. “This is what drives me and will always be. I’m so proud of my country & my people for the Roots, Love and Ubuntu. Let spread the Love. See you in your City...The journey continues.” The European/US Summer is beginning and I’m so excited and grateful to be able to travel the World, share Music, Joy and Love, one day at a time.
