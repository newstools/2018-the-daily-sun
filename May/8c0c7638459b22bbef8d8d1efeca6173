Dear MizzB I AM a 26-year-old man and I have a problem with my baby mama. We’ve been dating for three years and she’s cheated on me many times. She only comes to see me when she doesn’t have a job or at the end of the month. During the month she doesn’t pick up my calls or visit me. Hey Mr Sweet You have taught your baby mama that her behaviour is acceptable. When you know what and where you want to be in life, you’ll understand the quality of person you need as a partner. You’re not an ATM and deserve better! Send a Please Call Me to 083 323 1023 or email mizzb@lovelife.org.za
