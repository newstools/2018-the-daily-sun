The 31-year-old mayor of the Endumeni local municipality in KwaZulu-Natal have been arrested for allegedly attempting to assassinate the municipal speaker. He was bust with two other people. The mayor and his co-accused, aged 36 and 38, are expected to appear in the Estcourt Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said they were arrested in a "pre-dawn raid" by the political task team with the assistance of the National Intervention Unit (NIU). Mhlongo said this was after the team intercepted information of a plot to allegedly assassinate the municipal speaker. "The three suspects – the mayor, a councillor and a hitman – allegedly planned an assassination plot against the speaker, who is alleged to be an obstacle in the awarding of a tender. "It is understood the speaker allegedly suspected undue influence and possible corruption in the process." They are charged with conspiracy to commit murder and other related charges. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/kzn-mayor-2-others-arrested-for-alleged-assassination-plot-against-municipal-speaker-20180524
