A POLICE constable who was reported missing is in hot water. Constable Siviwe Ntengu (23) of Wells Estate was found sleeping in his car. A case of misconduct was opened against the cop after he allegedly sent his colleagues on a wild goose chase. Ntengu was supposed to leave for training in Bhisho on Sunday but never arrived. Captain Andre Beetge said: “Ntengu was last seen leaving his home in Bandla Street. “He left in his private vehicle, a silver VW Polo, and was on his way to All Saints Training Academy in Bhisho. “Ntengu is stationed at the Port Elizabeth 10111 Centre. His mother, with whom he lives, reported him missing at Swartkops Police Station.” Ntengu was apparently found sleeping in his car in Joe Slovo in the early hours of Tuesday. “Motherwell cluster commander Major-General Dawie Rabie has ordered a full investigation into his failure to report for a course and the waste of funds when they were searching for him,” said Beegte. Rabie said the police won’t tolerate misconduct. “Should it be proved he committed actions contrary to his standing orders, steps will be instituted against him,” he said.
