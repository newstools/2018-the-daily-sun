TWITTER is calling for a harsher punishment for Karabo Mokoena's Killer, Sandile Mantsoe. Mantsoe has been found guilty on all three charges including murder, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. Acting Judge Peet Johnson delivered his judgment on the murder trial of Mantsoe in the South Gauteng Court on Wednesday. Soon after the judgement, Mzansi took to twitter to call for a harsher sentence for Mantsoe.
