AJAX Cape Town will be hoping history repeats itself when they take on Kaizer Chiefs in their biggest Absa Premiership game of the season. The Urban Warriors upset Kaizer Chiefs 3-1 in front of a packed Cape Town Stadium to retain their Premiership status in the 2012-13 season. Five years later, the Urban Warriors find themselves in a similar situation, needing to defeat the Soweto giants to retain their league status once again. Ajax host Amakhosi at the same venue on Saturday (3pm). The Urban Warriors have to collect maximum points against the Soweto giants and hope results from other matches go in their favour. Their technical staff will surely be keeping an eye on: The Urban Warriors have to win their game and hope that SuperSport and Polokwane City lose their games so that they can avoid landing in the PSL relegation play-offs spot. If Ajax lose and end 15th, they will have to contend with playing in the play-offs. Former defender Matthew Booth, who played in that season-defining match against Chiefs five years ago, said coach Muhsin Ertugral – once again Ajax coach right now – got his tactics spot on in that big win against Chiefs. The Turkish coach will have to produce the same magic to help the Urban Warriors dodge the bullet again this season. Booth told the Urban Warriors official website that he is confident Ertugral could help the Cape outfit to survive the axe. Said Booth: “You couldn’t ask for a better coach to be in charge against Chiefs. Muhsin is the right coach for Ajax.” Booth hopes skipper Mosa Lebusa and Mario Booysen’s experience will help the youthful Ajax squad overcome Amakhosi, who hope to win the game to secure third place and qualify for the Caf Confederation Cup. The Urban Warriors are currently second from bottom with 31 points from 29 games, while Amakhosi are third with 45 points from the same number of games.
