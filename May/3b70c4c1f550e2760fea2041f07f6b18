FAMILY and friends of 10-year-old Ntwisiso Tshabalala are struggling to come to terms with her suspected suicide. The little girl’s body was found by a friend on Sunday, hanging from a tree near her home. Ntwisiso was in grade 4 at Tivoneleni Primary School. She’d been living with her dad in Nkovani Village near Saselemani, Limpopo, after her parents separated late last year. Her heartbroken mum told Daily Sun the family needed space to mourn. “I’m at the Home Affairs office getting her death certificate. I’m in pain,” said the mum. The rest of the family declined to speak to the SunTeam. A resident whose daughter was a friend of Ntwisiso said her child was traumatised and kept asking when Ntwisiso waws coming back. It was her child who saw Ntwisiso’s body and told the adults about the gruesome discovery. Limpopo Transport and Community Safety MEC Makoma Makhurupetje said: “I urge parents and community members to be responsible. “Look after children, especially when you suspect they’re either vulnerable or in need of extra care and protection.” She encouraged residents to come forward with evidence to assist cops in their investigation. Limpopo police spokeswoman Constable Mienkie Ramakgoakgoa said an inquest docket was opened. She said the cause of death was not known and cops were investigating.
