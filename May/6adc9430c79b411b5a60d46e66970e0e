THIS Week's bachelor became a laughing stock on Black Twitter. A bachelor named Raymond 'Sniper' Matosa, who said on the show that he was a reformed player, could not escape the wrath of Black Twitter and fans of Mzansi Magic Show Â Date My Family. As usual Raymond visited three families to sell himself and to learn more about potential partners. He then chose a potential partner to go on a date with, but Twitter was quick to point out that he regretted his choice. This was after he saw a video of Thato, a potential date he rejected.  While looking at a video of Thato, Raymond ran out of words and his facial expression was written regret all over it. Twitter noticed this and immediately started laughing a him with some saying the "player played himself". He ain't happy, it's Karma, said Black Twitter. Umzulu Phaqa tweeted: I know my brother, i know the regret of losing a pretty girl.
