THE bail application of the man who allegedly shot and killed a student was not heard in the Durban Magistrates Court yesterday because his residential address could not be verified. Thabani Mzolo (23) allegedly murdered ex-lover Zolile Khumalo (21) at the Mangosuthu University of Technology’s Lonsdale residence earlier this month. Magistrate Mohammed Motala said. “A physical address is one of the most important things to be considered when a suspect is granted bail.” Motala instructed that the accused provides a correct address at this next appearance on Thursday. Among those in the packed courtroom were deputy police Minister Bongani Mkongi and minister of Women in the Presidency Bathabile Dlamini. Hundreds of students and political party members protested outside court. Speaking outside court, Mkongi said: “Why would a man kill a young woman for dumping him? This dog must remain behind bars and never get any privileges.” He said the state’s case is water tight. “If we lose this case, someone must lose their job,” he said. Dlamini said: “The killing of women has become a trend and has to stop.” Zolile’s sister Mabongi Myeni (45) said they hoped the suspect will be found guilty.
