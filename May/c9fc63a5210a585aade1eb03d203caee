Local entertainer Zodwa Wabantu’s fans love her and she loves them too. So much so that she just felt she had to give a few of them kisses on the lips during one of her shows. The dancer later posted the video on social media in which she kisses almost every one of her adoring fans standing in the front row. All the constant bashing and ‘hate’ that Zodwa recieves on a daily basis mostly on social media pales in comparison to the sheer love her loyal supporters show to her during every one of her shows, and she’s not shy to show her appreciation.
