THE three friends needed a ride on Saturday, so Ayanda Mtshweni used a mobile app to hail a car. But that’s where the convenience ended. Ayanda (22) was left with a permanent scar on her forehead after the driver hit her with a spanner. Ayanda from Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, was moered for turning up the volume. She said she had requested a ride from her friend’s place in Tshwane North to Bosman Train Station. “The driver was rude and seemed angry. “To avoid talking to him, I tried to turn up the volume, but he slapped me across the face. I slapped him back and a fist fight broke out,” said Ayanda. She said the driver parked the car at a fast-food store in Hatfield, where the fight continued. “We all jumped out and continued fighting. He went to the boot of the car, pulled out a spanner and hit me on my forehead. “I’ve never felt so much pain in my life. I was bleeding heavily. “I went to the fast-food store’s toilet to wash the blood off my face.” She said her friends called the cops and an ambulance. She said while she was in the toilet, the driver tried to bribe her with R2000. “I refused to take his money and went on to press charges against him. “I want him arrested. He must also cover my medical bills. “The owners of this app must take this driver off the road as he is bad person. He is in the wrong line of work.” Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said cops are investigating a case of assault. No arrests have been made yet.
