Minister of Police Bheki Cele went all out in honouring his promise to serve the South African public by fighting crime. Abandoning his position at the helm of the country's police force for that time, Cele found himself a work station at the 10111 call centre on Tuesday, donned a headset and answered calls from members of the public. Part of his experience was captured on camera. In a video clip, which is doing the rounds on social media, Cele seems friendly as he engages with callers. "Hello, welcome to 10111 in Gauteng. You are speaking to Bheki Cele, Minister of Police," he tells a caller. And, from his response, the caller was clearly in disbelief. "No, it's not a prank. You are speaking to me," he says, as he smiles. But soon the exchange became serious. He urges the caller to go to the nearest police station to report the matter and to get a case number, adding that an investigating officer will take over. And, to show just how serious he was about his intentions, he handed out his cellphone number. "If they don't help you, I can give you my private cell number so that you can appeal to me if they don't help you at the police station."  News24
