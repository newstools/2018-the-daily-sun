corruption, racketeering and money laundering. In February, Dawjee and the companies he represented at the
time, Towbars Cape and Towbars King, were found guilty of corruption and fraud. The total of the bribes paid by him and/or his companies
amounted to around R96 000. His co-accused were convicted of corruption. Dawjee and his co-accused pleaded guilty to charges of
corruption in exchange for the State adding its support to arguments for a
non-custodial sentence. Allie took into account various mitigating factors. She said the accused were first offenders and had children
who were financially or emotionally dependent on them. All pleaded guilty and showed varying degrees of remorse. However, Allie was of the view that terms of correctional
supervision were not appropriate in this instance. SOURCE: NEWS24
