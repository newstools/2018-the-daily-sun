TENSIONS ran high yesterday when homeless people desperate for housing invaded private land. The trouble apparently started in Etete, KwaDukuza, where squatters stormed on to land and the municipality had to call the police to chase them away from the scene. A witness told Daily Sun thathundreds of people armed with building tools just arrived and started digging trenches. “The police arrived and talked to them, but they carried on working,” the witness said. “The police then had to fire rubber bullets to disperse them.” He said the invaders ran away but vowed that they would return, saying there was no way the municipality or the police could stop them. KwaDukuza’s mayor Ricardo Mthembu said the problem was that people had been “selling” plots of land to the squatters fraudulently. “Those people sell land that does not belong to them,” he said. “We heard this from the residents who tried to invade the land. The land that was invaded is private property. It has owners who want to use it to run their businesses. Those owners bought it from the municipality.” He said the municipality was there to serve everyone living in the area, but residents who did not respect others’ property rights would not be tolerated. “We are communicating with the police and the owners of the land to find a way forward. We will then call the residents who stormed the land to speak to them,” said Mthembu. The police had not responded to the SunTeam’s inquiries at the time of going to press.
