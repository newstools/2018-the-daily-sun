MPUMALANGA cops arrested two suspects for robbing a
Pakistani shop at Calcutta, near Bushbuckridge. The suspects made off with R25 000 in cash, airtime
vouchers and cigarettes. They then went on to Hazyview, where they also
robbed a filling station. According to Brigadier Leonard Hlathi the thugs
were driving in a blue Volkswagen Polo that was stolen in Matsulu, near
Malelane. "They were traced to Mahushu at Masoyi, upon
spotting the cops, the villains fled the scene and in the process fired shots
at the police," Hlathi said. Two suspects
were shot on the legs, whilst the third one was declared dead on the scene. He went to say three pistols and a rifle were seized
at the scene and the two suspects were taken to hospital. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID)
was alerted and they will also conduct their own investigation. The Provincial Commissioner of Mpumalanga,
Lieutenant General Mondli Zuma said the police will not hesitate to protect
their lives and those of vulnerable community members.
