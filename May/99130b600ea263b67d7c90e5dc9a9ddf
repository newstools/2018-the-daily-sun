MEC for human settlements in Gauteng Dikgang Moiloa is expected to conduct visits to various sites in the south of Johannesburg following tense protests over housing in the area this week. Police spokesperson Captain Phillemon Khorombi said police had responded to protests along the M2 Golden Highway on Friday after another day of protests. He said police would continue monitoring the situation. Regarding the situation in the south of Johannesburg, the department of human settlements said there would be site meetings on Saturday. The department's spokesperson, Keith Khoza, said: "The MEC met with the steering committees of the communities [on Thursday]. Although some of the community leaders initially walked out they later returned to the meeting. "The meeting agreed that the MEC should come to Eldorado Stadium on 12 May 2018 to address the communities," Khoza said. 31 projects planned He said Gauteng currently had a backlog of 600 000 houses, with only about 15 000 being built according to the provincial department of human settlements. "In relation to the south of Johannesburg, through its engagements with the communities, the department has informed them that some of the areas in which the people currently reside in do not have enough land to build for them," he said. Khoza said, however, that the fifth administration of government had adopted the Mega Human Settlements project programme which aimed to build more than 80 000 houses through seven projects which were currently in different stages. "In total 31 mega projects are planned," he said. "Through the serviced stands programme government will allocate people stands with basic services such as water, [sewerage] and electricity and qualifying beneficiaries will build for themselves using plans that have been approved by the department and municipality," he said. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/human-settlements-mec-to-meet-with-housing-protesters-in-johannesburg-south-20180504
