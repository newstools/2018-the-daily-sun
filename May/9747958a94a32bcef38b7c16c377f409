Acting Cape Town mayor Ian Neilson, is set to appoint his
mayoral committee. In a statement issued on Sunday, Neilson said he is required
by statute to appoint a Mayoral Committee (Mayco) to assist him in the
governance of the city, and he is ready to do so. He further said that he had previously deferred the
appointment in the wake of an urgent application by Patricia De Lille
challenging her removal as Cape Town mayor and DA member. "I am advised that, legally, nothing precludes me from
proceeding with the appointment of a mayco, but out of respect to the court I
will delay making the appointment until 15:00 on Monday, 14 May,‚Äù he said. On Friday, the Western Cape High Court reserved judgment in
the matter. Neilson said that if the court did not rule by Monday, he
would go ahead with the appointment. His counsel indicated during court proceedings that he will
wait for the judgment before considering the appointment of a mayoral
committee. However, on Sunday Nielson announced his decision to make
the appointments on Monday. "I will not be able to wait any longer than that
because without a mayco from early in the coming week the governance of the
City will be compromised," said Nielson. Among other things, a mayco is required to give political
guidance to the budget process, which is far advanced, for the forthcoming
municipal financial year," he said.
