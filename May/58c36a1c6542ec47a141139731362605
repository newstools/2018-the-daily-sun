The Miss South Africa organization is, this year, celebrating 60 years of the pageant. To celebrate, they have spared no expense in making this yearâ€™s pageant, termed the Diamond Jubilee, a spectacular affair. Leading up to the big night, 40 previous Miss SA title holders came together to celebrate the legacy of the brand and usher in the new generation of Miss SA. The Miss SA 2018 pre-celebration was held at Altitude Champagne Garden in Menlyn Main, Tshwane, the new home of the pageant. 40 former Miss South Africa title holders were in attendance including Miss Worlds Penny Rey Coelen (1958), Anneline Kriel Bacon (1974) and Rolene Strauss (2014) as well as current Miss Universe Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters and Miss Universe 1978 Margaret Gardiner.  The beauty queens also received special commemorative rings that will now also be given to every future winner of the crown. To mark its 60th year jubilee milestone, the Miss South Africa Organisation also announced the launch of the Miss South Africa Legacy Initiative. The project, run in partnership with the Tomorrow Trust, will use the combined power and profiles of previous Miss South Africa titleholders to collectively approach corporates, sponsors and supporters of Miss South Africa, as well as the public, to contribute funds towards the further education of young South Africans who have the academic potential but lack funds. The initiative will provide holistic support to disadvantaged young people to access and excel at university. Blue Label Telecoms has already made a R100 000 donation to the fund. The Miss South Africa Diamond Jubilee will take place tonight and will be hosted by Bonang Matheba. Catch all the action live and simulcast on M-Net (DStv Channel 101) and Mzansi Magic (DStv Channel 161) from 17h00 to 19h00.
