ZITHULELE Dlamini (42) rejected artificial hands because he didn’t want to live an artificial life. Zithulele, who was born without hands, didn’t want the limbs offered to him at hospital and instead taught himself to draw with his wrists. Now Zithulele, from Nkungwini Village in Ngwavuma, northern KZN supports himself with his art. The People’s Paper found him in the busy Dr Pixley kaSeme Street in Durban, drawing cartoons. Zithulele said since his pension grant was mysteriously stopped three years ago, he makes a living by getting donations from people who appreciate his work. “People passing by are attracted to my drawings and donate money. On a good day I can make R150 to R200,” he said. “I wanted to be myself. I don’t think people would have liked my drawings if I was using artificial hands. Now they stop and ask how do I draw without hands.” He said he learned to write using his amputated hands at the Soshanguve Disability School, before returning to Mfolozi High School in northern KZN, where he did grade 11. “I moved to Durban in 1993 where I started drawing cartoons. People liked them. “When my pension grant was stopped I depended on my drawings to support myself financially and to pay my rent in a flat.” He said he didn’t regret refusing to use artificial hands because he wouldn’t have learned how to draw and would have had to depend on the grant. Sassa provincial spokesman Vusi Mahaye said he would arrange for local Sassa officials to visit Zithulele to fix his grant.
