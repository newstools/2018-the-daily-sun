“DO WE have to suffer because of the value of their homes? “If that’s the case, they have to tell us if they know about our situation?” These questions were asked by people who want to occupy a piece of land near Protea Glen, Soweto. Yesterday, it was residents versus residents as they clashed over land. Residents who live in bond houses in Protea Glen are worried about the value of their homes. They said crime, izinyoka and illegal water connections will be the order of the day if invaders are allowed to occupy the land. A community leader dismissed the homeowners’ claims. “It saddens me to see black people fighting each other over land. At this stage they know our struggle,” said the man (30). Tshepo Zulu (46) said they were going to build shacks, for now. “We will then raise money for Wendy houses because they’re better than shacks,” he said. “Regarding electricity, we have spoken to some people to provide solar panels for us. “And we’re still discussing the issue of water.” The land invaders said if there were plans for the land, government should find them another place. Gogo Ouma Musula (64) told Daily Sun: “I live with eight family members in a one-room house. “That’s why I decided to come here. I need land to build a proper house. “I’ve applied for an RDP several times, but with no luck. “Houses are often being given to young people.”
