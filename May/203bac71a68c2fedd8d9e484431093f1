RESIDENTS are living in fear and believe a white Toyota Venture is kidnapping schoolboys. According to the people of Angelo squatter camp in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, the occupants of the vehicle target kids on their way to school. The residents said last week, a girl was mistaken for a boy and kidnapped by the occupants of the vehicle but when they undressed her and found she was a girl, they let her go. The 13-year-old girl was apparently left in the bush and walked to nearby houses where residents called the cops. She was taken home but no case has been opened. Her parents said although they were relieved she wasn’t raped, they feared for her safety. The girl’s mum said: “This car waits for children and the people in it pretend it’s a taxi.” On Monday, the vehicle stopped and the occupants promised a schoolboy lunch but when he refused to get in, they allegedly chased him. The 14-year-old boy’s mum said: “He dropped his school bag and ran home.” She said she had been walking her son to the bus stop every morning since the incident. “I have seen the vehicle and it has no registration number. We appeal to cops to patrol the area.” Colonel Daniel Baloyi said he was only aware of reports of a white Toyota Quantum. “We appeal to parents whose children have been approached to come forward and give us details.”
