BABES Wodumo’s family has slammed Metro FM’s Masechaba Ndlovu for questioning her about abuse claims against Mampintsha. The family of the singer, whose real name is Bongekile Simelane, yesterday said Babes was caught off-guard by Masechaba and was not ready for her questions. This comes after last week’s interview on the station in which she revealed she broke up with West Ink boss Mampintsha, whose real name is Mandla Maphumulo. Babes’ father Bishop Welcome Simelane said: “We have unanswered questions on why Masechaba did that.” He said he and his family didn’t know Babes was being abused and they were shocked by the allegations. “Interfering in the private matters of our children is not how we do things, but in this matter we decided to comment. “After all we’ve said, we would like to thank Mampintsha for uncovering the talent of our daughter. We hope he will accept that she has grown and will support her with her new company Wena Wodumo Entertainment.” DJ Tira has released a video on social media about a song called Isandla Sesisthathu, saying he loves Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha.
