THE Kouga Municipality is eager to put roofs over the heads of needy residents. On Tuesday, it identified land in Jeffreys Bay. The land will be used for the construction of 1 500 RDPs in Ocean View. The R46 million project will take about 24 months to complete and will include the building of roads and toilets. Norland Construction has been tasked with building the houses. This is the municipality’s third housing project. The Kruisfontein project provided 391 housing units while 220 houses were built in Pellsrus. “The people of Kouga have waited a long time for decent housing,” said Councillor Bryan Dhludhlu. He said members of the community have a significant role to play in the success of the project. “During construction, we might ask squatter camp residents to move to a temporary shelter. “We ask that the community work with us to minimise delays as much as possible.” Dhludhlu said the municipality will regularly provide feedback regarding the project’s progress. He said the project is expected to create a number of jobs. Dhludhlu said the municipality will re-establish housing committees to ensure strong public participation. “It’s important for the community to take ownership of this project. “The government must be as transparent as possible.” Ocean View resident Morne Toolbus (27) said he expects his mum to benefit from the project. Toolbus told Daily Sun: “My 78-year-old mum has been on a waiting list for many years. “I hope she will finally get a house and move out of her shack.”
