THE south of Joburg was a no go area yesterday. Residents of Zakariya Park, Lehae and Vlakfontein took to the streets and blocked them with rocks, rubbish and burning tyres. They were protesting about the lack of water in the areas, as well as other issues. Police had their hands full trying to break up the crowds. In Orange Farm, cops used rubber bullets to break up the crowd blocking the Golden Highway with burning tyres and stones. Residents told Daily Sun water is a basic necessity. Sbahle Majozi (30) from Orange Farm extension 2 said water is life. “For the past few days, it has been hard for us to cope without running water. We cannot live like this.” She said they don’t understand why water was cut off in their area and no one spoke to them about it. “It’s been raining hard and dams are full. Why cut off water? Now we’ve shown them we are not to be played with.” The JMPD’s Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said traffic was re-directed due to the protest on the Golden Highway near the entrance to Zakariya Park. “Protesters claimed they haven’t had water for three days,” said Minnaar. Joburg Water tweeted that there was a high demand for water from the high level reservoir and it could not cope. In Phomolong section, Tembisa, residents said they are tired of being cold due to electricity cuts. Many claim they buy power but their lights always go off at night. They said this has been happening for about a week. On Tuesday they took to the streets to protest, blocking roads. Fired Cops had to be called.
