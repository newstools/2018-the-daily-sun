ANGRY Bloemfontein Celtic supporters will do whatever it takes to save their home team from going to Kimberley, Northern Cape. This after a rumour that Siwelele chairman Max Tshabalala was selling the team to an unknown businessman in Kimberley for R60 million. Fans held a meeting yesterday, demanding to meet Tshabalala, who didn’t pitch up. The fans barricaded roads with stones, rubbish and burning tyres. Shops owned by foreigners were apparently looted. An angry fan said they’d heard rumours their team was being moved to Kimberley. “We can’t allow that to happen,” he said. Celtic fan Stephen Mothobi (37) from Batho branch said Tshabalala didn’t want to meet them. “Now we believe the rumours because Tshabalala failed to arrive,” he said. He said the club belonged in Bloemfontein. “We’re nothing without our soccer team,” said Stephen. Another angry supporter told Daily Sun: “This is a shame. Dr Petrus Molemela, the founder of the team, is turning in his grave. “We’ll keep Bloemfontein in flames until Tshabalala comes to his senses “We have a good idea to raise money ourselves and save our team.” Celtic chief executive office Khumbulani Konco said he was not aware of the meeting. “We had a meeting with supporters on Tuesday,” he said. “We’ll discuss with management when we’ll meet supporters again.”
