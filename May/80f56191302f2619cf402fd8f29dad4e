THE Polokwane Magistrate's Court has sentenced Mbhazima
David Mabasa (59) to four years in prison for demanding  bribes to approve a student bursary. Mabasa is a former Department of Education assistant director
in Limpopo and was responsible for awarding bursaries to students at the
University of Venda. He has also been given an option of R160 000 fine, half
of which is suspended for 5 years. HAWKS spokesperson Matimba Maluleke said during May 2017
the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Investigation unit arrested Mabasa after he
demanded R4400 from a University of Venda student who had applied for a
bursary. Mabasa wanted a bribe before he could approve the student's
application. Mabasa was granted R1000 bail and subsequently made a
series of court appearances which culminated in the recent conviction and
sentence.
