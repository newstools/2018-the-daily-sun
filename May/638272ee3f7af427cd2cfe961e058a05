THE EFF has welcomed the judgement in the murder case of Karabo Mokoena
who was allegedly killed Sandile Mantsoe. Judge Johnson found Sandile Mantsoe, who had been Karabo Mokoena’s
lover, guilty of assault, murder and defeating the ends of justice. "We welcome this verdict as a step in the right direction towards
finding justice for the high levels of femicide facing our country. South
African men are at war against women." "A woman in our country, including the girl child, lives in
permanent fear of sexual assault, rape and brutal murder, often by someone they
know intimately," EFF National Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. Ndlozi  said Karabo's case gives
confidence that justice can indeed be served. He said, this is a step forward in dealing with violent patriarchal and
misogynistic masculinities as many cases never get resolved. In a statement, Ndlozi said a great deal of work still needs to be done
to prevent the brutal murder and rape of women and the girl child. "We call on society to take inspiration from this judgement and
improve on the fight against femicide." "We call on families and all formations to believe reports of
women and girl children and above all provide them with all the necessary
support," he said.
