AMAZULU-BOUND Free State Stars dribbling wizard Nhlanhla Vilakazi says it will be tough to say goodbye to his teammates after the Nedbank Cup final on Saturday. The midfield maestro has had a fantastic season with Ea Lla Koto and is expected to bow out of the side in style when they meet high-flying Maritzburg United in Cape Town this weekend. Vilakazi did not renew his contract with Stars and signed on the dotted line for Usuthu after he captured the imagination of Cavin Johnson with his impressive vision, dribbling trickery and general fitness. “I want to reward Stars with a fine performance in the final because the club treated me very well. Although it will be difficult to say goodbye, I want to do it in style by beating my former team (Maritzburg) and winning the cup,” he said. “When I arrived at the club I went through a very rough time. I could not play because there was a two-month dispute with my former club. But the club bosses, the Mokoena family, helped me and kept me motivated. I am just looking forward to Saturday,” he added. Regarding Maritzburg, he said they would be well prepared and always have a solid game plan. “We will fight to win at all costs. There are many seniors in the team and no pressure on us. Our strengths are that we can distribute the ball beautifully, we are more organised and good on the counter-attack. We are also fit and are able to perform better in the second half,” he added. Stars general manager Rantsi Mokoena tried to keep him in Bethlehem but Vilakazi’s mind was already made up. “I applaud him because he stayed professional even though he was leaving. We are happy for him,” said Mokoena.
