THE Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality’s integrated public transport system has faced many problems in the past. It’s been plagued by problems and allegations of corruption since it started. But now that the buses are operating, residents say they fear for their safety. They said the company contracted to build bus shelters along Standford Road in Korsten, Port Elizabeth, dug up big holes and have left them open. Kelvin Moss (25) of Clearly Park told Daily Sun he nearly fell into one of them when he was running to catch a bus. Municipal spokesman Kupido Baron thanked Daily Sun for bringing the matter to his attention. “We visited the site on Monday as we will not allow a situation where contractors don’t safeguard a site. “This message was clearly communicated to the company concerned as public health and safety regulations seem to have been compromised.”
