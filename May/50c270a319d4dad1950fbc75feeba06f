A WOMAN who allegedly staged her own kidnapping has been
bust by cops. According to the Daily
Monitor, Christine Nabasumba (25) apparently went off to work as a mobile
money agent in a suburb of Kampala, Uganda on Friday. But she never made it home. Her dad, Samuel Byakale, told the Daily Monitor: “Her sister in Kampala had told us on Thursday last
week that she was receiving phone calls from unknown people who were
threatening to kidnap Christine. On Friday when she went to work, she didn’t
return.” Then on Saturday, Christine called her dad herself. She
claimed that the kidnappers were demanding Shs10 million (about R33 200) ransom
– or else they would kill her. “I immediately called cops in Kampala, which mounted a
search for her,” said Samuel. But what seemed like a life-threatening nightmare came to
an awkward end when cops discovered her hiding in a nearby guest house. Cop spokesman Luke Oweyesigire said today: “Police found
her in Mpumude guest house located in Busega which is 16 kilometers from her
home.” She is currently behind bars, awaiting trial for giving
false information to the public. This follows an incident earlier last week when a woman
was arrested for faking her kidnapping – allegedly to see if her husband loved
her.
