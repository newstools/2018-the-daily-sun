DISTRAUGHT AmaZulu coach Cavin Johnson has advised his management to seek legal advice after they were dramatically kicked out of the top eight of the Absa Premiership by SuperSport United. The controversial case involving Tendai Ndoro and Ajax Cape Town saw upheaval in the PSL table, with Platinum Stars no longer relegated and Ajax Cape Town now in the National First Division. The ruling, which saw Ajax lose nine points to Polokwane City, Platinum Stars and SuperSport, has pushed AmaZulu one position down the table to ninth. Johnson said they had worked hard to be in the top eight and saw themselves having a 50/50 chance of winning a cool R8 million for three matches if they clinch the season-opening MTN8. “You and I are not God or a sangoma to say Ama­Zulu wouldn’t have won the MTN8,” said Johnson. “This is not the end,” he added, suggesting that Lunga Sokhela join Ajax in appealing yesterday’s ruling by arbitrator Advocate William Mokhari SC. “We’ve collected our points fairly, now this. What hurts most is that we have done nothing wrong but end up being punished. It is much more painful this way. “Yesterday we were in the top eight and today we’re not. Yesterday we had chances of being R8 million richer and today we do not. Please, man . . . Players won’t accept this ruling – they’ve done nothing wrong. “Our sponsors will also get involved and question the whole mess. And it will be messier because some teams are being punished for doing nothing wrong.”
