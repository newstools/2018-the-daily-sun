THE Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) has announced that
former ANC MP Makhosi Khoza will be joining the organisation as an executive
director. Khoza has also been
tasked with the role of being the head of its local government programme. OUTA CEO Wayne Duvenage said they appointed Khoza because
she is bold and courageous. In April, Khoza officially retired from politics, she said she
wanted to pour her efforts into the education and elevation of African
languages. In the briefing Khoza, said it is time for one to
consolidate and embark on a journey that began in 1996. Khoza added that people would agree with her that local
government was tragically ignored. She said it is gratifying that OUTA has taken a decision to
focus on this sphere of governance.
