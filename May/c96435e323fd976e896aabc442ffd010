MUSICIANS have been paying their last respects at the home of legendary guitarist Philip Tabane since the sad news of his death on Friday. Tabane died at Mamelodi Day Hospital, aged 84, after being  admitted two days earlier. On Saturday, legendary jazz musicians Vusi Mahlasela, Julian Bahula and family spokesman Dr Sello Galane visited his Mamelodi West home in Tshwane. Tabane was known for hit songs such as Nkupi and Muvhango. Speaking to Daily Sun, Sello said Tabane was still going strong in music despite his age. He said he had been undergoing treatment at home, and his son Thabang had been looking after him. Sello said he would dedicate his life to documenting the life of Tabane. “He treated me and other musicians like family,” he said. “I’ve known him for over 30 years and have learnt a lot from him.” He said Tabane didn’t attend school beyond grade 2, but was very smart and wrote plays and music. A memorial service will be held on Thursday at the Mamelodi West Community Hall.
