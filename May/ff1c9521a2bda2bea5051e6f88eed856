Making the decision of what nail colour to wear is one of the toughest decisions women have to make. You have to think of the season, what’s in trend, the nail shape and if the colour looks good on your skin tone. Here are seven winter nail colours to choose from this winter: 1. Holographic Holographic has been a huge trend since 2017, and it looks awesome as a nail polish colour. Try to go for a light, nude holographic nail polish.  2. Nude Nude is always a good colour for any season and for anyone. Keep it clean and simple for winter.  3. Chocolate brown Dark colours are always a must for winter, and chocolate brown is a huge trend right now.  4. Red nails Red is a classic nail polish colour. When in doubt just wear red.  5. Dark green Dark green is a lovely colour for cold winter.  6. Dark purple Just like dark green, these dark colours are great to add a subtle pop of colour.  7. Ombre Forget the classic french manicure and go for the ombre look for a more trendy look.
