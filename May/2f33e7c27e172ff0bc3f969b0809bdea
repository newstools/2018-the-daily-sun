Dear MizzB I AM a 24-year-old woman. I’ve been with my man for five years and I’ve cheated on him more than 12 times. When a man asks for my numbers, I give them to him and later sleep with him. Do I have a disorder? Please help. Dear Lady For any diagnosis to be real, first look at the choices you’ve made to be in this position. One of the reasons people cheat is to boost their egos. It’s an easy way to remind yourself you’re desirable. It’s important to note that until you’re satisfied with who and what you are, no amount of sex will complete you.
