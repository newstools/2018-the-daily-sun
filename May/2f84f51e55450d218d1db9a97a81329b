RESIDENTS woke up in shock yesterday morning to find the police raiding their neighbours. The raid in Seshego extension 73, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, happened after police traced cash-in-transit robbery suspects to a house in the kasi. The suspects are believed to have been involved in the robbery on Matlala Road between Polokwane and Chenbeng Village on Monday morning. During the raid, a Toyota Hilux and a Ford Kuga that were reported stolen in Gauteng were found at the house. It’s believed both vehicles were used as getaway cars in the robbery. The cars were damaged by bullets and police found rifle ammunition, explosives and empty money bags in the cars. The police operation, which started at 2am, was led by the Hawks serious crime investigation unit. It was supported by the provincial task team, crime intelligence and the tactical response team. The recovered vehicles, which had false registration plates, were both towed to the police’s storage depot for recovered items. Limpopo Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke praised the joint team that arrested the suspects. “A manhunt started immediately after the robbery. “Some of the suspects were arrested earlier in Groblersdal and another one in Westenburg. They took police to the house, where two more suspects were arrested,” he said. Maluleke said although the money had not been recovered, more arrests were coming. “Seven suspects aged between 24 and 49 are facing charges including armed robbery and possession of stolen vehicles,” he said. “So far, no police officers or security company employees have been arrested but more arrests are expected.” The suspects will appear in the Polokwane Magistrates Court today.
