A year after releasing their previous single “Nice Life Problems”  the talented Rap Duo TLT signed to RapLyf Records release their follow up single Titled Sweety, the song Samples the 2007 smash hit Sweety My Lovey, by DJ Walker. TLT felt like they needed to express how they felt about Love and their partners. Considering how much negativity there is around men and how they treat women, the group felt like they needed to be the voice of reason, a voice that spoke about how much they value women and the impact that they have on their lives. The song speaks about love, relationships, the values that they appreciate in a woman and how they would go to the ends of the world to make sure that they keep her safe. With a nostalgic and catchy chorus, a strong baseline and verses that make you want to express your love for your partner more, Sweety is sure to be a favourite with the ladies and a banger in the clubs. TLT’s previous single, Nice Life Problems, celebrated life and was motivational in the sense that no matter what challenges you face in your daily lives, you always need to celebrate life.Please watch the Nice Life Problems video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm-glU8yrQE L-tech, one half of the group says “The inspiration for the song came from the fact that they wanted to spread the word of love and to also give people something to dance to. Trouble, the other half of the group says “We want people to lose their minds whenever they hear the song, because of the nostalgia that the song brings whenever it plays, this song is already a classic and we know that the country will feel the same way.
