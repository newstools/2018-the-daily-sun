WHEN the Mancoba brothers were arrested and others killed, the church closed down. However, top cop General Khehla Sitole yesterday told the Portfolio Committee on Police in Parliament they had received information that Mancoba Seven Angels Ministries Church is in various provinces around South Africa. The brothers allegedly killed five cops in Eastern Cape. “The Mancoba Seven Angels Churches are all over the country. We are looking at this matter as a national issue,” Sitole told Parliament. Sitole said that more cops have been deployed in Eastern Cape since the incident. He said they need communities to join hands with them in order for cops to deal with organisations disguised as churches while they are fronts for criminal activities. He said: “We are not going to tolerate those churches of a criminal nature. We are dealing with organisations that are dealing with church organisations, including the South African Council of Churches. MP Livhuhani Mabija said: “Those churches must be dealt with. They are wolves in sheep’s clothing.” The police were also questioned about the death of 10-year-old Katlego Joja from Mamelodi. This came after police allegedly turned her family away, telling them to come back after 24 hours. The MPs asked what had been done after cops failed the Joja family. Tshwane East cluster commander Major-General Andre Wiese said three police members had been issued with letters notifying them of an intention to suspend them. “Notices have been issued to suspend the members who turned down the family members twice and told them to come back after 24 hours. “The commander of visible policing is in the process of being relocated and will be replaced by an experienced colonel from Tshwane East,” said Wiese.
