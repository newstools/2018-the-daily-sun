THE waste disposal backlog has turned parts of the city into a pigsty. So yesterday, scores of residents from Alexandra, Hillbrow, Joubert Park, Doornfontein and Mayfair marched to mayor Herman Mashaba’s offices. When they got there, they made sure that part of the city was a mess too, as they dumped rubbish, burned tyres and blocked the CBD streets with rocks. The protesters marched through the city centre, causing delays and traffic jams on several streets. The angry residents said they were gatvol after several weeks of irregular refuse removal. They said they are being exposed to unhealthy conditions and fear they will get sick. The protesters collected rubbish around the inner city and dumped it outside Mashaba’s office. City spokesman Muzi Mkhwanazi told Daily Sun the municipality has been trying to clear the backlog in the affected areas since Tuesday. He appealed to people to use the proper channels to raise their concerns. Mkhwanazi said the city’s waste management company was painfully aware about the unacceptable levels of waste in these areas. “Contract workers started cleaning and clearing this unfortunate backlog and work will continue until today, when normal service will be restored. “It must be emphasised that the affected areas have been serviced but with limited resources. “There has never been a time where Pikitup services were discontinued in the affected areas,” he said. “Mashaba has asked Pikitup managing director Lungile Dhlamini to personally oversee the clearing of this backlog,” said Mkhwanazi. Joburg Waste Management has appealed to residents in these areas to help keep their areas clean by joining the monthly voluntary A Re Sebetseng clean-up campaign.
