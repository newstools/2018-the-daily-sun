FIVE community leaders told Daily Sunthey were living in fear after a service delivery protest. They claimed Councillor Khosi Gwayama in Langaville, Ekurhuleni wants them dead. However, the councillor as well as cops and the municipal spokesman advised them to open cases with the police. They claimed every night since the protest which started last week, cars come to their houses at night to fire shots. They said they don’t know if these are hitmen or the councillor’s body guards. “We reported this to the Metro cops but they don’t take us seriously. They’ll wait for something to happen before they act,” said community leader Castro Ndubane. Another leader, Bheki Ngobeni, said about eight shots were fired outside his house on Tuesday night. “We’re not happy with how she’s allocated the Tsakane ext 22 RDP houses. She’s left out old and vulnerable people to make way for her friends. She has her own list and the housing department doesn’t know the people on it. We suspect a bribe was paid here,” Bheki alleged. Thomas Nkuna said she’s a dictator. “She doesn’t listen to the people. We are not surprised because she was not elected by us.” Councillor Gwayama told Daily Sun she doesn’t allocate houses. “I know those people. If they receive threats why don’t they open cases?” she asked. The community leaders said they wrote five letters to the Ekurhuleni mayor and Luthuli House but nothing’s been done. Themba Gadebe of Ekurhuleni Municipality said the councillor doesn’t have the sole power to allocate houses.
