THE Polokwane Municipality has  condemned unruly motorists who attack traffic cops. On Monday, a traffic cop was allegedly assaulted while issuing a ticket for illegal parking. Last month, Daily Sun reported that another officer was threatened by motorists and shoppers. He was trrying to tow a car parked in front of a bank. Municipal spokesman Tshidiso Mothapo urged all motorists to obey and respect traffic officers’ instructions. He said they should obey road rules to avoid having action taken against them. “There was an unfortunate incident where a traffic officer on duty was knocked over by a motorist,” he said. Backup had to be called to the scene. “The motorist, who was identified as a lawyer, was detained and will be facing the full might of the law,” said Mothapo. The motorist apparently has had more than 20 tickets issued against him in Polokwane alone, and has never paid any of them. He said the officer was injured and rushed to hospital. He was later released after being treated and is said to be recovering at home. “The municipality will enforce the law on the road,” said Mothapo. “We will require full cooperation from the public to ensure that the roads are safe.”
