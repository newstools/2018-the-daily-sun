RUSSIANS are gearing up for the soccer World Cup beginning in June, with one entrepreneur opening up a brothel that only has sex robots. According to The Mirror, Dmitry Alexandrov recently opened the Dolls Hotel in Moscow, with robot magoshas with names like Lolita, Sasha and Alisa available for sex with horny soccer lovers. Rooms can be rented at the Dolls Hotel on an hourly basis from £17,75 (about R300) for basic ones up to £29,50 (about R500) for luxury suites. The additional cost of renting the “sexbot” puts the total for the experience at about £60 (about R1 000) an hour. A spokesman for Dolls Hotel was quoted in the report as saying: “We really are waiting for a flow of visitors during the World Cup - and we look forward to having many foreign clients, including from England. “This is why we are now getting special permission to welcome foreign visitors. “As for the players - if they are allowed by their coaches and managers, we will only welcome them.” The sexbots are described as being “warm” with “mechanical movements and an artificial brain”. Alexandrov said: “Creating a full scale leisure adult centre in Russia is not only a legal and safe way to improve your sex life, it is also a step towards fighting one of oldest problems in Russia – the violent exploitation of women.” Alexandrov adds that each sexbot is thoroughly cleaned with “special solutions” according to “international standards” after each client, ensuring sex free from risks of infection.
