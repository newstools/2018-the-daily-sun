ANGRY parents protested outside Guzana Secondary School in KwaDukuza, northern KZN yesterday. They said the they were worried about their kids’ lives because the school uses izinyoka power. Parents claimed the school had been without electricity since last year and the matter was reported to the education department but nothing was done. The school had also been without water since last month. Parent Hlanganani Nhlabathi (53) said that they would continue to protest until the department had resolved the matter. “We started protesting on Wednesday. Our kids are often sent home early because they can’t learn when there’s no water,” said Hlanganani. “Toilets have been closed since last month. It’s also shocking that the school uses izinyoka to operate.” Sipho Mbambo , chairman of the school governing body, said parents wanted Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane to resolve the matter. “The school has been using izinyoka since August. Before that, the teachers relied on neighbouring schools to print documents and do school work that needed electricity. Parents are afraid that izinyoka will hurt their kids.” S’celo Khuzwayo, a spokesman for MEC Dlungwane, said the department was aware of the situation at the school and was dealing with it. “Sometimes parents report to the circuit office and the matter doesn’t reach our head office. “We only heard about the matter on Wednesday when the circuit officials told us about protest,” said Khuzwayo.
