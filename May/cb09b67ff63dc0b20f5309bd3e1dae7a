BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic have been SOLD! SunSport can confirm that R60 million has been exchanged between Siwelele chairman, Max Tshabalala and an unknown businessman from Kimberley. This has left tongues wagging among the club fans who are shocked that their most prized asset has gone to the Northern Cape. It has come to our attention that the new boss plans on relocating the club to the diamond city in 2020, as part of the agreement. Said our source: “The club will continue playing their home games at the Dr. Petrus Molemela Stadium next season, but they will also use the Griqua Park in Kimberley as their alternative venue. The new boss wants to assess first how the team will be supported in his home town before relocating permanently.” The move has left a bitter taste in the mouths of Siwelele fans who had hoped that the financially stricken Max Tshabalala will sell the club to previous owner Jimmy Augousti, who sold it to him in 2014. A disgruntled source in high ranking position said Augousti was prepared to buy the club for R70m and keep it in the Free State. But Max had apparently already concluded the deal with the unknown buyer from Kimberley. Tshabalala is being blamed for Siwelele’s failure to attract new sponsors: “MTN and B3 are gone because whenever they invest money, Max buys expensive cars. That’s why they pulled out their investment. He doesn’t run the affairs of the club well and that’s why the first team coaches and those is development structures haven’t been paid their salaries for the past three month.” Efforts to contact Max and Augousti drew a blank as their mobile phones rang unanswered. Celtic chief executive, Khumbulani Konco, said he doesn’t entertain rumours: “Until further notice anything you will hear is a rumour, and I won’t comment on rumours.
