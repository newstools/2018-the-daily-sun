BACKYARDERS who have occupied land in Makhaza and Town Two said they will not leave. The residents of Khayelitsha are at war with the City of Cape Town. The cops have chased them away many times but they keep returning. Vuyelwa Zenzile (30) said she and her husband had been chased away by cops three times in one month. “We have no choice because we have been waiting for houses but nothing has happened in the past 10 years,” she said. Residents were furious when cops arrived yet again on Monday to pull down their shacks. Bulelwa Qgoloma (38) said: “We want land to build our houses. We will die defending this land.” Municipal spokeswoman Priya Reddy said there were plans to build houses in the area. “The city is in the planning phase of several new housing developments in Khayelitsha, especially state-subsidised Breaking New Ground units for those registered on the city’s housing database,” she said. She said households with a monthly income of less than R3 500 qualified for the units.
