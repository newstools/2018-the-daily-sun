A guard of honour is a guard, usually military in nature, appointed to receive or guard a head of state or other dignitary, the fallen in war, or to attend at state ceremonials, especially funerals.  Members of various components of the South African
Defence Force have held two successive and impressive guards of honour, one for
the late Mama Winnie Mandela and most recently, for the departed former
Minister of Social Development Dr Zola Skweyiya.  In these pictures, the men and women guarding our shores
and borders gave Dr Skweyiya a fitting tribute during his Category 1 Special
Official Funeral in Tshwane. SunMan Morapedi Mashashe was there to capture the
special moments as Mzansi mourned the passing of yet another struggle stalwart.  A guard of honour is when a person or group of people
line up to congratulate other(s) on achievements. It is also a ceremonial guard usually military guard for
a head of state, fallen police officers and other civil servants.  In South Africa we usually witness a guard of honour
during state funerals like the Burial of Struggle stalwarts Winnie Madikizela
Mandela and Dr Zola Skweyiya recently.
