THE parents of a nurse killed by her husband on Sunday say they wouldn’t wish the pain they are feeling on anyone. They were speaking from their home in Richmond, in the KZN Midlands during a visit from Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo. Maternity nurse Ntombizodwa “Zoe” Dlamini (40) was shot dead at her parents’ home. Her father, Lot Ntuli, said she was at their house to tell them her husband had beaten her on Saturday. “We arrived home from church to discover Zoe was home. I joyfully greeted her but she responded by telling me her husband had beaten her,” he said. Lot said while they were still talking, his daughter’s husband phoned her and demanded to know where she was. “When he arrived, we sat him down while Zoe hid in one of the bedrooms,” he said. “When we asked him to call his parents so the fight could be resolved by elders, he got angry.” Lot said the man stood up, pulled out a firearm and started looking for his daughter. “He found one bedroom locked and kicked the door open. When he found Zoe, he shot her dead,” he said. Cops later found Zoe’s husband dead. He had shot himself. Dhlomo told Lot: “We must thank God he didn’t kill everyone who was home.”
