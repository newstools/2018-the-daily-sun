MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has revealed that he voted for Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune and Maritzburg United midfielder Siphesihle Ndlovu for the Absa Premiership Player of the Season. Mosimane suggested that he wanted to vote for Percy Tau, but could not due to the fact that coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players. Mosimane who won coach of the month accolade for April on Wednesday said: ”I voted for Itu, (Khune) because he’s got many clean sheets. If a goalkeeper of a team is goalkeeper of the year, then I think you should know that he was doing a lot of work to make sure that the team doesn’t lose." On Ndlovu who could also win the young player of the season after his sterling campaign with Maritzburg, Mosimane said: "I also voted for Siphesihle Ndlovu. As I said, I can’t vote for Percy, but when I look at the points-difference between Maritzburg and Sundowns and the number of goals that Percy and ‘Siphe’ scored, I said, ‘Oh, okay, but I have to vote,’ then I voted for the boy. "I think he has done exceptionally well as a youngster and he’s had a fantastic year, but Percy scored – I think – nine goals last year? That’s why he says they are in the same position. So those are the boys who did very well this year." Tau is among the top goalscorers in the league with 11 goals while Ndlovu managed to find the back of the net five times.
