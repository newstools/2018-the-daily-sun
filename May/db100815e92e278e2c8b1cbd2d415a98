DURBAN Magistrates Court will soon refer the Glebelands Hostel murder case to the high court. On Thursday six of the seven suspects were denied bail as it was believed likely to risk proceedings. Magistrate Siphiwe Hlophe said the court was waiting for a ruling from the national director of public prosecutions, in connection with a racketeering charge, before a high court date could be set. The case was then postponed to 31 May. “The suspects argued they don’t know who the witnesses are. “They also said they will not put the case at risk,” said Hlophe. He then said, however, that evidence given by prosecutor Dorian Paver suggested otherwise. “He put it before the court that the suspects know who the members of their rival faction are. “The Glebelands killings have been continuing for some time with no or few convictions, because witnesses are killed or withdraw out of fear.” All the suspects were bust in December and have since been in jail. They face 20 charges in connection with events at the hostel between August 2014 and March 2016. These include murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, racketeering, extortion and unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. When their bail applications were heard early this month, the court heard that suspect Khayelihle Mbuthuma withdrew his application after he was given a life sentence for the murder of hostel resident Sibongile Mtshali last year. When the suspects were refused bail, many relatives and friends showed their disappointment. “This is so unfair. They should have been given bail because they have not yet been found guilty,” said relative Dorah Mkhungo (31).
