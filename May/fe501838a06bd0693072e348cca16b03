WHEN the customer took his car to the mechanic for a service, he expected it to be fixed. It became a write-off on Wednesday, however, when the mechanic crashed the customer’s car into a taxi, injuring 15 people. Two passengers were rushed to hospital having suffered serious injuries, while the others escaped with minor hurts. The mechanic fled the scene in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni and the cops are now looking for him and the owner of the car. The Toyota Corolla, which was seriously damaged in the front and the back, was taken and impounded in Benoni. Witnesses said the mechanic appeared to be drunk. One said: “That is why he ran away. He knew he was going to be arrested for driving drunk.” One of the taxi passengers, Nomsa Ntuli (38), who sustained injuries to both her legs, also said the mechanic looked drunk. “I was on my way home from Daveyton Mall after buying groceries when the accident occurred.” Nomsa said the mechanic veered into the wrong lane and crashed into their taxi. “Our taxi was not speeding. The accident injured many people, including the driver. I now have metal in both legs and I’m sad because my life will never be the same again,” she said. Mirriam Mkhabela, another passenger, broke her hip. Police spokesman Captain Mack Mngomezulu confirmed the incident. “Our cops went to the scene and found a grey Toyota Corolla had collided with a white taxi. Several passengers were injured and we are currently looking for the driver of the car and the owner,” he said.
