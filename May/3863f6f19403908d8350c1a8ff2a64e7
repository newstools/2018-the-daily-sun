THULANI Nzima had hoped his father, famous photographer Sam Nzima, would recover from his illness. After spending an hour and a half visiting him on Saturday, Thulani left the hospital. But a few minutes later as he was driving back to Joburg, he received the sad news that his dad had died. He told Daily Sun of his heartbreak at seeing his father for the last time. Thulani said he had been travelling to Joburg from Bushbuckridge but decided to stop by his dad at the Rob Ferreira Hospital in Nelspruit. “I was the only family member who visited him that day and the idea was to assess his condition. The hospital staff gave me the impression he was going to recover.” Thulani said the family was shocked by his father’s death and never expected the short illness would take him away. “He was a strong man and that’s why we were hopeful.” He said the family couldn’t speak to the media on Sunday as they were not yet ready. “We are touched by how the country embraced him for the role he played and we are grateful for the support.” Meanwhile tributes continue to pour in. Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtsweni visited the family yesterday and said everyone was aware of the role Nzima played during apartheid. She said she would write a letter to the president and request a state funeral. Thulani said the funeral is expected to be held on Saturday. ANC provincial secretary Mandla Ndlovu said: “ We are going to have his memorial service on Thursday. We respect the decision by the premier to apply for a special send-off for him.”
