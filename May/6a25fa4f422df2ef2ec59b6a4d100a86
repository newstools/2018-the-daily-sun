MORE than 6 000 households in Slovo Park and Elias Motsoaledi will be receiving electricity for the first time. This was revealed by Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba during a visit to the settlements on Tuesday to review the progress made with electrification projects. Residents told Daily Sun they could not wait for electricity. Mampho Sibiya (48) said: “Life is hard without power.” She said she had been living in the squatter camp for more than 10 years. “Without electricity this place is horrific. There is too much crime at night because people do whatever they like without being noticed,” said Mampho. She said people also ended up making illegal connections, which was dangerous. Residents told Daily Sun they were happy the Joburg Municipality was helping them. Zakhele Mshengu (35) said: “Our lives and those of our children will now be simple. Surely even shack fires will decrease.” Gogo Nomasonto Zwane (65) said that her granddaughter sometimes bathed in cold water because there was no way to boil water quickly. Mashaba said 3 734 informal households in Slovo Park would receive electricity in the first week of next month and a total of 3 000 RDP houses in Elias Motsoaledi would be connected towards the end of next month.
