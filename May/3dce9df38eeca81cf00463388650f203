THE Cele family is at its wits end following a disagreement between their funeral service provider and eThekwini Municipality. Nomzamo Mngoma (30) from KwaNdengezi, west of Durban told Daily Sun that her father, King Cele (71), died on 22 April. She said the family had arranged for him to be buried on 29 April, but that never happened. According to Nomzamo, Ikhaya Funeral Home owner, Zah Ndlovu, is refusing to release her father’s body for burial. The owner allegedly wants the municipality to pay him for his services but the municipality wants to take the body without paying. Nomzamo said when her father died, the family didn’t have money to bury him. “We took him to Ikhaya Funeral Home and asked the councillor to ask the municipality to help us bury our father,” said Nomzamo. She said on 27 April, Ndlovu called them and allegedly told them he wouldn’t release the body because the municipality refused to pay him. “I suspect they have issues we don’t know of and now we are suffering. We plead with mayor Zandile Gumede to intervene because the body has been there for two weeks,” said Nomzamo. Speaking to Daily Sun, Ndlovu confirmed that he won’t release the body because the municipality doesn’t want to pay for his service. “The municipality called to say they want to help the family bury their loved one. When I asked them to pay me for storage, they told me they have a funeral parlour they working with and that the parlour would collect the body and handle all burial costs,” said Ndlovu. The mayor’s spokesman, Mthunzi Gumede, said: “Our wish is that all parties involved help the family and leave their issues out. “The mayor will make sure the family gets the help it needs.”
