STRIKING Samwu members have brought the Great Kei municipality in the Eastern Cape to a halt. Last week the municipal building and some of its vehicles went up in flames. The union members in the municipality are now calling on the department of co-operative governance and traditional affairs to urgently intervene before the municipality collapses. All municipal buildings have been shut down since the strike turned violent last week. Samwu members have been on strike since 3 May, complaining about many issues. These include the illegal appointment of alleged unqualified directors, salary discrepancies, as well as the non-payment of staff insurance and pensions to third parties. Samwu shop steward Luthando Juju said they decided to go on strike after the employer failed to address their grievances. “We call on Cogta to place this municipality under administration,” said Juju. “We need clarity on the financial status of the municipality.” This is not the first time Samwu workers have been on strike this year. In February they took to the streets demanding that the municipality get rid of casual workers. “In February we suspended our strike after MEC Fikile Xasa intervened. “A new organogram was put in place without us being consulted. “We need to be led by an experienced mayor and managers. We will not go back to work until our demands are met,” said Juju. Cogta spokesman Mamkeli Ngam said: “I cannot recall any letter from Samwu in the Great Kei municipality requesting intervention by the MEC. “If we receive a letter from the stakeholders, the MEC will apply his mind and to intervene accordingly.”
