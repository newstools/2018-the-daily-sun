“HOW on earth could we be called village tinpot dictators?” This was what angry traditional leaders asked yesterday at a media conference in QwaQwa, Free State. The members of the National House of Traditional Leaders said they were furious at former president Kgalema Motlanthe for referring to them as village tinpot dictators. He allegedly said this at a summit on land expropriation without compensation over the weekend. House chairman Inkosi Sipho Mahlangu said Motlanthe’s remarks were a disgrace to the ANC and its attempt to build better relations with traditional leaders. “He appears to be serving or speaking on behalf of the dictators, the neoliberals and the republicans.” He said they believed the ANC was afraid to tackle the 87% of land under private ownership and was shifting the blame onto them. He said they had engaged with the ANC through the office of the secretary-general to seek clarity on Motlanthe’s comments and the ANC’s official position on the matter. Eastern Cape House of Traditional leaders chairman Inkosi Mwelo Nonkonyana said they had not been consulted over the land issue. “To call a traditional leader that is an insult,” he said. He said it was a known fact many traditional leaders and members of their communities had fought and died for the liberation of Mzansi. He said it was also known communal land belonged to communities and was only held in their trust.
