THREE weeks ago families of the dead buried at a graveyard in Lenasia, south of Joburg, were shocked to find their remains dug up. A tractor had dug up old graves at Precast Cemetery. A family went to the graveyard to perform a ritual for their late relative, and there they discovered the graves dug up. According to a community leader there were about 68 graves in the area and seven had been dug up. To add insult to injury, water was left running and washed off some of the bones. But the man behind the digging apologised and promised to make things right. The families demanded the bones be laid to rest properly and a ritual be performed. On Friday the tractor owner kept his promise and contributed a cow and other things to make the ceremony possible. Family members slaughtered the cow and took snuff and traditional beer to the graves on Saturday morning to ask for forgiveness. The families then went back to their homes in Finetown, near Ennerdale, where a ceremony was held. Julia Motholo (60) said she hoped that her madala, brother and aunt were now resting in peace. “In this grave we buried my grandfather and my brother, who died a long time ago,” Julia said. “We are relieved that the person who caused all the trouble has apologised. “Even though we are still hurt by the incident, we hope there will be peace after this ritual.” Community leader Dan Nkgadima said they were touched by the white man’s remorse and respect for their tradition. “The man apologised and did what was right. We forgive him because he made the ritual possible.”
