THE death of his precious seven-month-old son was already too much to bear for heartbroken dad Sebota Mosamane (43) and his family. But yet more pain was thrust into his heart when baby Mora’s body went missing from the government mortuary in Pinetown, west of Durban. Now even the father’s dreams have become filled with grief, when he dreams of seeing his little one crying in a dark place. Sebota, from Chatsworth, said the baby’s body was sent to the government mortuary for a post mortem after he died in Mahatma Gandhi Hospital on 26 March following a short illness. “I started dreaming I was seeing my boy crying in a dark place. I believe that he is not resting, or his soul is in trouble. “Perhaps he wants me to rescue his soul, but I do not know how to do that,” said Sebota. Ncumisa Mafunda, spokeswoman for the KZN Department of Health, said investigations were continuing. “We are working with all the parties involved, including the police,” said Mafunda. Sazi Mhlongo, the president of the South African Traditional Healers’ Association, said that the dreams could mean the boy’s soul was not at rest. “The father should consult sangomas, who will clarify everything about the dream and tell him what he must do,” Sazi said. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of theft of a corpse was being investigated.
