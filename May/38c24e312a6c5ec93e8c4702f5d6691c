NONJABULO Buthelezi (23) is a happy mum. She gave birth to twin babies on Wednesday. She was grateful to the nurses at Pomeroy Community Health Centre, KZN Midlands, for helping her when she unexpectedly went into labour. Babies Siyabonga and Zenande were expected to be born today, but due to concerns with their growth were delivered on Wednesday. “Medical staff at Pomeroy helped me a lot, said Nonjabulo. “I hope they continue to help other people. “Even though I was scared, they were able allay my fears.” Nonjabulo had been booked to deliver as a high-risk patient at Grey’s Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. “But on Wednesday, while at home in Pomeroy, she started experiencing mild cramps that became serious in the evening,” said the KZN Health Department. “It became clear she was going into labour and was rushed to Pomeroy Community Health Centre.” Doctor Sanele Madela, CEO at Pomeroy, said when Nonjabulo arrived they had no choice but to help her deliver. “We prepared everything to ensure we were ready,” he said “We made sure the necessary drugs were in place. “We didn’t want to wait for her to bleed and had to prevent it.” Madela said the babies were immediately transferred to Church of Scotland Hospital in a specialised ambulance. Siyabonga was put in a nursery because of his low birth weight. Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo congratulated the Pomeroy medical team. “We’re proud of Dr Madela and his team for helping the mother deliver the twins,” the MEC told Daily Sun. “It takes nothing less than expertise, passion and dedication to do what they did.”
