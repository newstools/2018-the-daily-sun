MADALA Sunnyboy Mbuli (60) was relaxing in front of his TV on Saturday afternoon when evil struck. A vicious fire suddenly started in his bedroom and the flames raced through the nine-roomed house, devouring one room after another. Madala Mbuli, of Emalahleni Extention 5 in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun there was nothing electrical in the bedroom. He added that he strongly believed it was evil vutha sent by his jealous ex-wife. The incident that left three bedrooms, the kitchen and bathroom completely gutted happened on 28 April. “The fire was too strong. The smoke and flames spread to other rooms and we managed to save only a few items with the help of my neighbours.” He said they also managed to break the garage door and remove his car. Mbuli said he started to have bad luck after he separated from his wife of four years. “I lost my job last August and had a car accident in February but I wasn’t hurt,” he said. He said his wife, Phiwe Nkosi, left him after a brawl. “She cursed me and said bad luck would follow me wherever I went. Since then it has been difficult to sleep.” Contacted for comment, Phiwe said: “That’s is all lies. I don’t know what he’s talking about. I wasn’t even aware his house was burnt.”
