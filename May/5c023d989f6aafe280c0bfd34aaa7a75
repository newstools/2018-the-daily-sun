A 23-year-old man was killed in a hit-and-run by a taxi in Delft on Monday morning, Cape Town police have said. "The circumstances surrounding a culpable homicide vehicle accident are being investigated following an incident this morning at 08:40 in Symphony Road in Delft," said spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut. A 14-year-old was also taken to hospital, but no more was immediately known about their condition. "The driver fled the scene and he is yet to be arrested," said Traut. He would not speculate on whether the accident was related to a reported taxi dispute and protests in the area on Monday. Earlier, burning tyres blocked off Delft Main and Hindle roads. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/man-killed-in-cape-town-taxi-hit-and-run-20180514
