THE “People’s Poet” Mzwakhe Mbuli has declared war on the internet giants, Google. "For every Goliath, there is a David." These are the words of a very angry Mzwakhe Mbuli as he
prepares for a big fight against Google. The people's poet said he is going after one of the World's
biggest companies, Google,  after he
found an article that labelled him “HIV-positive” on Google. He says the company has defamed his character and that
they are also violating his human dignity by classing him as an HIV sufferer. During an interview on SABC, the people's poet said the
world needs to know the truth. He said he found out about the article after people started
asking him if he was positive. He didn't take it seriously at first but when a fourth
person asked him that's where he demanded to know the origin of the rumours. "I  mean look
at me....even people who have done medicine can testify...I don't take any tablets....the only thing I take
is juice....I don't drink, I don't smoke...I'm healthy..I have a clean bill of
health," said Mzwakhe. He has instructed Advocate Mphafolane Jerry Koma to take
legal action against Google. "I have instructed him to do exactly that and there
is no turning back..we are going for these guys. "If we don't challenge this, they will do it to
someone tomorrow....Its' people who are hell bent on destroying other people's characters. "Who are these thugs, these mosquitoes who are trying to destroy
Mzwakhe Mbuli...I'm unsinkable," he said. When asked if he's not scared of taking on a big company
like Google, which is worth billions of Rand, Mbuli said that for every Goliath
there is a David. "Who is Google? Who says Google can't be challenged....that it's untouchable? are they God..is Google synonymous to God or Tsunami?, asked
the angry Mbuli, adding thathe's not afraid of Google.
