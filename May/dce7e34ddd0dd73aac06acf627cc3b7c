Young children are forced to use a field as a toilet at Ntshingeni 
Senior Primary in the Eastern Cape school, while teachers turn to 
neighbouring houses, reports GroundUp. "We
 feel abandoned by the government. Most of us went to school here using 
these [same] old toilets, and even our grandchildren are forced to use 
them," said Phumla Sitetho, a parent from Ntshingeni village near 
Cofimvaba. Malixole Dliso, a teacher at the school, said the 
toilets were built in the 1980s. The zinc toilets are some distance from
 the classrooms and in a poor condition. The seats are broken and there 
is only rough stone and concrete to sit on. "Since a five-year-old pupil fell into a school pit toilet in Mbizana in the Eastern Cape, we feel our children are not safe in these toilets," said Sitetho. The school has 254 pupils from Grades R to 7. One
 teacher, Khanyiso Twala, said in his three years at the school, he has 
never used its toilets "because of the condition they are in". Spokesperson
 for the Eastern Cape Department of Education Malibongwe Mtima said at 
the beginning of the year, each school is given a maintenance budget. But
 school principal Trom Antoni said he had written a letter to the 
department in 2015 asking for new toilets. He was told to send 
photographs of the toilets, which he said he did. He said he never heard
 back. Antoni added that the maintenance budget was not enough. They needed to start afresh with new toilets. "We plead to the department to hear our cry â€¦ for the sake of the young [pupils] that are at risk," said Antoni. Mtima said the department will send a team to the school to survey the toilets.
