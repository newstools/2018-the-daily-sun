At least ten people were injured after a taxi and a truck collided on the R55 and Wierda Road in Sunderland Ridge, Pretoria on Thursday morning. When ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene shortly after 9:00, they found a patient still trapped inside the taxi. The fire brigade had to extricate the patient using the jaws of life. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said that upon further assessment, it was found that the patient sustained serious injuries. ER24 treated and stabilised the patient before the patient was airlifted to hospital by medical helicopter. Another patient was also found to have sustained serious injuries while the rest sustained minor to moderate injuries. "The exact circumstances surrounding the incident were not known to our paramedics but the police were on the scene for further investigations."
