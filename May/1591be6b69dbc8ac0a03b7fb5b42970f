A VIDEO of the late Akhumzi Jezile (29) preaching about death has surfaced on social media. But little did the award-winning actor and TV producer know that those words would touch so many hearts. In the video, shared by Lerato Kganyago on Instagram a day after his crash, Akhumzi shares a sermon with his friends. Sport presenter Andile Ncube can be heard translating his words into Xhosa. Akhumzi said: “According to us on earth, death is the final destination because He said it’s not over until He declares it.” Uber Xhosa wrote on Instagram: “Remember a person’s last words. They always carry a message.” Cikylicks wrote: “Wow what a soul. “He was full of life, love energy and a large smile.” Family spokesman Percy Vilakazi said they were humbled by the support and prayers received. “Even though we’re still dealing with the loss of our son and brother, the family is comforted by the knowledge that Akhumzi loved the Lord and was unashamed of the gospel of Christ.”
