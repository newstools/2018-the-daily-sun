THE world is connecting at a very fast pace, thanks to digital technology. According to Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Zweli Mkhize, this creates a gap between rich and poor, rural and urban. Speaking at the Girl Geek campaign launch in Joburg on Monday, he said the gap could create two nations: one would be part of the new industrial revolution and the other would lose out. The campaign aims to encourage girls from poor communities to become involved in science, technology, engineering and maths by teaching them computer science. As part of the programme, children learn about robotics, websites, video games and technology. They’re pushed to use these skills to build products that solve social problems. The campaign is run by Ikusasa Le Afrika Foundation, of which Mkhize is a non-executive director, and Africa Teen Geek. Mkhize said it’s important for young people to be empowered with technology skills. He was inspired by young Tebello Matlali, who designed a computer game for kids when she was only six. “I’m proud to be part of the campaign that empowers a generation of young women to share in the digital world,” he said. “Social platforms keep us captive the whole day, and I’m even wondering how we grew up without these apps. “We need to empower our youth for the digital world.” He said days when engineering, science and maths were seen as being too difficult for women are gone.
