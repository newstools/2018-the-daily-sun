COPS are investigating a murder after the body of a
44-year-old Taxify driver, which had two gunshot wounds, was discovered in
Protea Glen, west of Soweto in Johannesburg on Wednesday evening. Police spokesperson Captain Hector Netshivhodza said that
the driver's torched vehicle was found 8km away in Snake Park on Thursday. "The driver's relatives filed a missing persons report
last night, but because the body was found in a different jurisdiction we
didn't know the car and the body were connected," he said. A case of murder and damage to property were opened but no
arrests have been made, Netshivhodza said. Co-founder of drivers' organisation The Movement, Teresa
Munchik, told News24 that, while the man was a Taxify driver, it was not clear
whether he was killed during a paid trip. Taxify could not be immediately reached for comment by
News24, however a spokesperson was quoted in The Star as saying that a
"high-priority team" was working with the police to investigate the
incident. SOURCE: NEWS24
