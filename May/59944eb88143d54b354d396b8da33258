MANY QUESTIONS remain unanswered about the house that burnt down. What is known is that a tragedy happened in that brick building early on Sunday morning. TWO SMALL CHILDREN, A BABY AND THEIR FATHER DIED A TERRIBLE DEATH. “I still can’t believe they are all gone! “We are left with so many unanswered questions, such as how the fire started in my brother’s brick house,” said relative, Gertrude Nkhoma (37). The four people who died in Vrygrond, Muizenberg, Cape Town are Wanakho (11), Mbali (6), four-month-old Chiyamiko and their father, Humphrey Nkhoma (37). “We don’t know what really happened. We were told my brother had an argument with his wife, Wendy Ndzila (27) and she left him and the kids and went out with friends,” said Gertrude. Humphrey’s brother, Harry Chili (32), said when Wendy came back to feed the baby the fire had been put out. “She thought we were bluffing when we told her that her husband and kids had died. “She didn’t believe us and said they were at her mother’s house. “Then she fainted. We have been told she has suffered a stroke and is in hospital,” said Harry. “A lot has happened and we are confused.” A resident told Daily Sun he heard the wife had locked her husband and kids in the house. “I’m just telling you what other people are saying,” said the resident. “The wife is saying she left the key inside but if that was the case, the people in the house could have run outside when the fire started.” Harry said his brother’s wife told them that she left the key with her husband. “It is not clear what really caused the fire. Even the landlord doesn’t understand how the fire only destroyed one house,” said Harry. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said an inquest is under investigation following the fire that left four people dead. “The incident occurred in Vrygrond during the early hours of Friday morning. “Circumstances are under investigation. No arrests have been made,” she said.
