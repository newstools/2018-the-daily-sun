MOST people wanted to see if Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha would perform together at the Umlazi Picnic. But the two avoided each other all day on Saturday. This follows allegations that she was abused by Mampintsha. Babes was the first to perform at the picnic that saw thousands flock to the King Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi, south of Durban. During her performance, Babes was repeatedly heard saying in Zulu: “Yazi ngizojika. Yazi ngizophenduka.” Directly translated, this means: “I will change, you know. “I will turn, you know.” But she didn’t show any signs of being unhappy. Mampintsha, Danger of Big Nuz, and a guy called Sizwe got on stage after Babes. Mampintsha couldn’t stop mentioning Babes’ name during his performance. “Ayeye Babes Wodumo ayeye! Wola Babes! Wena Wodumo!” he was heard saying during the performance. Babes didn’t go on stage to sing her chorus on his new single Amaketanga. Danger assured fans:  Big Nuz is here to stay. “We’re not going anywhere. ‘We love you and we always will.”
