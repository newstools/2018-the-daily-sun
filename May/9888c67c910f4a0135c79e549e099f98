THE local Aids Council held a candlelight memorial service at the Mhlontlo municipal offices in Qumbu on Wednesday to honour those who died and are living with HIV. The council’s Makaziwe Mgobhozi said: “Back then, only professionals tested. The stigma was so bad many died, even with treatment available. “Today, we have a new fight against infections among girls and young women. We fought for better treatment through stigma and denial, even from the Presidency.” Three colours of candles were lit. Black was for those who died, red reflected the danger of not knowing your status and white was for those living life positively. Mhlontlo mayor Nompumelelo Dywili lit a white candle, saying: “I’m lighting this for all the councillors and the people of Mhlontlo. We live in the light and let us all get tested, take our treatment, and live positively.” Nontsikelelo Thungatha chose black. “This is for those who lost the fight and orphans,” she said. Zukiswa Meme tested positive years ago. “It was the work of NGO Siyakhanyisa that uplifted me. Let’s fight against infections.”
