Kaizer Chiefs interim coach Patrick Mabedi has revealed that goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune is injured and will miss Saturday's Absa Premiership clash against Ajax Cape Town. It is a must-win game for both teams for differing reasons as Chiefs need three points if they are to have any hope of securing CAF Confederations Cup football next season. Whereas, Ajax need to win as they are in a desperate battle for survival with a number of other sides at the wrong end of the standings. As such, Mabedi stated the significance of the encounter when facing his former coach Muhsin Ertugral, while admitting that Khune would play no part. He told Chiefs official website: "I have an idea of how they will approach the game. I have worked with Muhsin (Ertugral) before and heâ€™s able to vary his approach in one game. "Ajax have a number of players that we have to watch. I think we will compete well against them especially when it comes to quality. We will have an upper hand. "I played under Muhsin in the 90s and I was captain here Chiefs. And in the 2015/16 season I was his assistant coach at Witbank Black Aces. So, I know his mentality. He will know me as well and that will make for an interesting game. We will give it our all. "Leonardo Castro is serving suspension, captain Itumeleng Khune has an abdominal pain, Sibusiso Khumalo is out with hamstring and Teenage Hadebe still out with ankle injury." The caretaker mentor added that back-up keeper Brilliant Khuzwayo would take his place in goals for the clash at the Cape Town Stadium at 3pm.
