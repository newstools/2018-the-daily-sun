“I WANT every girl to try and embrace who they are!” These were the words of 23-year-old Tamaryn Green after being crowned Miss South Africa on Sunday night. Tamaryn, who is originally from Paarl in the Western Cape, was crowned at Time Square, Tshwane. The beauty with brains, a sixth year medical student at the University of Cape Town, said she had always been passionate about making a positive and progressive difference to the lives of others. “My message to young girls is that we’re all different. We should be comfortable in our own skins and find our strength.” Tamaryn said as a young girl, she wanted to be a doctor so she could help people. “Now I’ll be able to heal people through medicine and with the Miss SA title. “Miss SA will provide a different way of helping people and giving back. “I grew up being exposed to two different worlds, that of the rich and the poor. I want to assist in bringing those worlds together and this can be done by providing equal education.” Tamaryn walks away with R3 million worth of prizes. She will represent South Africa at the Miss Universe pageant later this year. Her prizes include a Nissan Qashqai, a Samsung phone, an apartment while she holds the crown and R1 million in cash. Runner up Thulisa Keyi (26) will represent South Africa at Miss World and will receive prizes worth R600 000.
