SOWETO topped the list of road deaths and traffic offence arrests in Joburg over the long weekend. Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane said yesterday that, of the 252 arrests, 53 took place in the kasi south of the city. From 26 to 30 April, there were 41 accidents, during which 22 pedestrians, 11 drivers, 15 passengers, two motorcyclists and a cyclist died. “It’s of great concern that unwarranted behaviour continues, as shown by the fatalities this long weekend,” the MEC told the People’s Paper. “Many accidents were caused by speeding, driving under the influence, and driving unroadworthy vehicles, among other things.” But she insisted that traffic cops were hard at work during the busy long weekend ensuring that drivers adhered to road rules. Nkosi-Malobane expressed her condolences to the families of those who died.
