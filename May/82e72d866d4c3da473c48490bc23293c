LEGENDARY jazz musician Phillip Tabane was remembered at a memorial service in his home town of Mamelodi in Tshwane yesterday. Tabane died at the age of 78 at Mamelodi Day Hospital last Friday. Celebrities such as Sipho “Hotstix” Mabuse, Letta Mbulu and Welcome Msomi, as well as government officials and residents, filled the Mamelodi West Hall to capacity. Actress Nakedi Ribane was programme director with the assistance of Sello Galane, while legendary musician Vusi Mahlasela performed. Speaker after speaker praised him for singing a truly African genre. Malombo drums were also played at the memorial service. Tabane’s bandmate, Julian Bahula, said he was one of the most talented guitarists in the world and worked hard to perfect his talent. “I’ve played with guitarists in New York and London but I’ve never heard or seen anyone who plays like him.” Julian said although he was sad over his death he was comforted by young people who played malombo music. “Young aspiring musicians in Mamelodi sing malombo. I thought they would go for western music, but they’ve humbled me,” he said. Gauteng MEC for Arts and Culture Faith Mazibuko said the country had lost a treasured star. “We appreciate, honour and acknowledge the role he played in the country and art,” said Mazibuko. She said everyone had gathered to celebrate his life and not to mourn. “Wherever Tabane was, there was dancing. He had a rare talent and his music helped in the struggle against apartheid,” she said. She said the Moretele Jazz Festival should pay tribute to him. Mbulu handed a special blanket to the family as a token of appreciation. City of Tshwane MMC for Arts and Culture Ntsiki Mokhotho said Tabane was Africa’s greatest guitarist.
