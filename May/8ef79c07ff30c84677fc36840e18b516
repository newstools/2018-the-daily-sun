Thobile Mkhutshwa lost the use of his legs after contracting spinal cord TB in 2010. The 36-year-old from Samora Machel squatter camp in Cape Town chose to look on the bright side of life and live his life to the fullest. Today, he works for the country’s top pay-TV operator, DStv, and drives his own car. Thobile told Daily Sun doctors discovered that he had TB in 2007. “I found it difficult to walk and I was admitted in hospital. In 2010 my worst fears were realised. I became wheelchair-bound and at first it was difficult to accept that I would never walk again. “But I told myself it was not the end of the world.” Thobile gave up his job at Blue Ribbon bakery because the place did not cater for disabled people. He took customer service and computer courses and five years ago, he landed a job at DStv. “Being disabled comes with many difficulties, driving being one of them,” he said. Thobile said after he bought his car he took it to a manufacturer who installed modifications for handicapped drivers. “Disabled people should not feel sorry for themselves. They should not sit at home depending on other people to support them. “They must learn to do things for themselves,” he added. But he said it’s a pity they are still being treated as inferior. He thanked Daily Sun for publishing his story back in 2012. “Ever since that story was published my fortunes changed for the better. I’m so proud of the People’s Paper for changing my life.”
