GOGO Regina Radebe’s life in a rented mud hut was getting too much for her at 79 years of age. She allegedly asked her councillor at the beginning of this year if she would ever get an RDP house. She said the matter was referred to the ward. She was allegedly promised that she would get one on the anniversary of Chris Hani’s death on 10 April this year. But the day came and went and the sad gogo told Daily Sun she has finally realised that it was just another empty promise. Gogo Regina lives alone in the mud house in Copesville, outside Pietermaritzburg. “ I’ve been renting it since 1998. After I asked the councillor for help he visited me. “I was profiled by ward members who concluded that I deserved an RDP. “Municipal officials also visited me and promised that my house would be finished in April this year,” said Regina. But Councillor Spha Madlala said he became aware of gogo’s plight after reading a story in a community newspaper last month. “I have since forwarded the matter to the municipality and KZN Department of Human Settlements,” said Madlala. Msunduzi municipal spokeswoman Thobeka Mafumbatha said the matter is handled by Human Settlements. Department spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi, said: “I will check whether Madlala had reported the matter. I’m currently not aware of this but I’m sure that if it was forwarded to the department, it will only take three months to build her an RDP house.”
