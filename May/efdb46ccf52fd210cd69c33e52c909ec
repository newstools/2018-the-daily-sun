SUNFLOWER Park outside Clocolan has a lovely name. But the residents’ lives are a living hell as the municipality has allegedly failed to collect and empty their bucket toilets for the last two months. The municipality is supposed to empty the toilets every two weeks. However, gogo Pulane Khakhathiba (65) said the last time her toilet was emptied was in February. For the past two months, she’s had no choice but to dump her waste in the nearby veld. Gogo Pulane said: “We are living like pigs. I have reported the matter to Setsoto Municipality but nothing has been done. “Our children are getting sick. “The People’s Paper is my only hope. “Politicians only want votes. “They promise to improve service delivery but that is a lie. “When they are in power, they forget about the poor and only help themselves. “We will march to the local municipal office and dump our waste there. “We want proper toilets because we voted for a better life.” Municipal spokeswoman Moroesi Gaba denied the allegations. She said: “We have job cards that prove services were rendered in March and April. “Maybe the picture was taken before the buckets were collected.” However, Daily Sun photographer Ismael Ntholeng confirmed the picture in question was taken yesterday morning.
