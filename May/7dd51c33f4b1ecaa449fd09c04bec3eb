A KwaZulu-Natal pensioner was killed in an attack by two dogs that were
apparently known to her, paramedics said on Wednesday. Crisis Medical spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said they responded to the
incident around 12:00 at Heather Grove premises in Greenwood Park, Durban. "Reports from the scene indicated that a 67-year-old female was
attacked by two pit bulls and suffered fatal injuries. Unfortunately, there was
nothing paramedics could do to assist the lady and she was declared deceased on
arrival." Van Reenen said police were on scene to investigate further. "It is believed that the female is a family member of the owner of
the property and known to the dogs. However, this is unconfirmed at this
stage." KZN police confirmed the incident, but said they were still busy with
investigations at the scene. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/pit-bulls-kill-kzn-pensioner-20180502
