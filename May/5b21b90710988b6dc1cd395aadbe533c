THERE were mixed emotions at the memorial service for Brigadier Malefetsane Mofokeng yesterday. While mourners were sad to say goodbye, they were also outraged by the constant killing of police officers. Mofokeng, who was the station commander at Meadowlands Police Station in Soweto, was gunned down outside his home in Protea South last week. The memorial service was held at the Rock of Salvation Church in Orlando West. SA Police Union (SAPU) Gauteng deputy chairman Peter Ntsime called on police officers to protect themselves. “Who is next? Today it’s Brigadier Mofokeng, but who is next? This is a question we need to ask every day,” he said. Nzime said criminals had waged war against the police. “It leaves a damaging impression that criminals are in charge of the country and police are helpless. We will not normalise these police killings. If it means saying an eye for an eye, so be it,” he said. Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union deputy chairman for Gauteng Naughty Mogaoi appealed to management to support and protect members. Family representative Rabadisana Mofokeng pleaded with the people of Soweto to help the police find the killers. Meadowlands CPF chairman Bafana Zwane said it was very disturbing to have lost Brigadier Mofokeng. “The man who brought discipline to Meadowlands is no more. “It has become a trend for police officers to be shot in Meadowlands and we cannot allow that to happen,” he said.
