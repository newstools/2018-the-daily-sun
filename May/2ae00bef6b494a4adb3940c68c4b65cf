GOGO Mamotlokwa Makhele celebrated her 108th birthday with members of her church. Members of the Uniting Reformed Church’s Botshabelo branch bought gifts and prayed for the gogo. Reverend Puleng Letsie said: “We are here to celebrate with gogo Mamotlokwa, the oldest member of our church. Every year we do something for her. We thank God for giving her a long life. We hope we will also reach her age.” He said the gogo taught them to respect their elders and greet everyone, including strangers. Gogo Mamotlokwa from Phahameng, Mangaung said: “This generation will never be like mine. They sleep around and eat anything. “I have only been with one man: my husband. I only had children after I got married. “God loves me and I am thankful for the years He has given me. If young people want to grow old, they must respect their elders.” Gogo Mamotlokwa has one child, two grandchildren and four great- grandchildren. Her child Kekeletso Setlhaku (66) said: “I am lucky to still have a mother at my age. She likes to joke and tell us stories about how life was back in her day.”
