GAUTENG Premier David Makhura wants cops who failed to help the family of Katlego “Katli” Joja to be punished. The 10-year-old went missing from her home in Mamelodi, Tshwane two weeks ago and her body was found in the nearby Moretele River four days later. It later emerged that Mamelodi West cops turned Katli’s parents away when they first reported her missing, telling them to return in 24 hours. When Makhura visited the family on Sunday, he called for management at the police station to be replaced. Katli lived with autism, a disorder that affects the ability of people to communicate and interact with others. Deputy police minister Bongani Mkongi, Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, and police commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange have also called for the police station to be investigated. “I’m deeply hurt by the loss of little Katli and angry with the police,” said Makhura. “We need to change the leadership of Mamelodi West Police Station and the family wants action to be taken.”
