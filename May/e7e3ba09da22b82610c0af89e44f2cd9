NOKUBONGA Mantyi didn’t know she had the calling until she became so sick that she almost died. The strange dreams she had gave her a clue of what was happening. “I was always dreaming about water and traditional beer. “When I fell ill, doctors told me there was too much water around my heart,” said Nokubonga. When she realised she had the calling, she started training to become a sangoma in March. Her graduation ceremony was held at Browns Farm, Philippi on Saturday. “I am happy I answered my calling. “I don’t have strange dreams or heart problems anymore. “However, I had an operation because at the time I didn’t know I had the calling.” Although she doesn’t know him, Nokubonga believes her father was one of the ancestors who came to her in a dream. “Ancestors can work in strange ways. “Even though I don’t know them, they know me.” She said she had to change her name and surname after she accepted her calling. Now she is called gogo Manzini Patiso. According to Nokubonga, the name change symbolises the fact that she is now owned by her ancestors. “The name I am using is the name of the ancestor that lives in me. “I am so happy to graduate. “Now I will finally be able to use my gift to help people.” Sangoma Yoliswa Nyali, who is known as gogo Curry, said when people go to initiation school, they see things that normal people can’t. She said: “Before a twasa graduates, they must prove that they are ready to help people. “We can’t hold a graduation ceremony for someone who is not ready.”
