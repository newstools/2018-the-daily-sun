A HEARTBROKEN mum (52) says her kid’s school should have days and times for different religions. Her daughter (16), who is in grade 11, has been suspended for burning impepho and dagga at school. The incident happened at a boarding school in Dutywa, Eastern Cape last month. “My daughter was wrong to burn impepho and dagga in a closed room with other pupils. “Maybe it is time for the school to have days and times for different religions,” said the mum. On 20 April a pupil collapsed in a school hostel and the suspended pupil allegedly tried to help the victim by burning impepho and dagga. Principal Khulile Qamata said they were not against anyone’s religion, but the school’s code of conduct did not allow for the burning of dagga or impepho. “We held a disciplinary hearing on 23 April and the pupil was suspended, but she did not leave the hostel. “We spoke to her mum and told her to tell her daughter not to bring dagga or impepho to the school,” Qamata said. Malibongwe Mtima, a spokesman for the education department, said the school was not supposed to suspend the pupil on its own. “An investigation has been opened to investigate what happened and how to avoid it in future,” he said. “We are running away from a situation where Christians are treated better than other religions.”
