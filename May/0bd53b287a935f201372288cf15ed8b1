OUTSPOKEN Safa official Ace Ncobo faces a charge of misconduct from the football association. This is after the football governing body resolved to throw the disciplinary book at the former PSL referee for a string of charges, including that of wilful violation of the Safa statutes. Safa CEO Dennis Mumble confirmed yesterday they will haul Ncobo over the coals. “We are charging him. We can’t have someone continue to be so undisciplined. We are charging him with wilful violation of the Safa statutes,” said Mumble. “We did warn him about that before. Obviously he is not happy about it. We can’t have someone who continues to rubbish the association. We sit in meetings, consider matters that are on the agenda. Mumble has been vocal about Safa matters, slamming the association’s leadership over mismanagement and violation of the Safa statutes. He denied that he apologised for his behaviour at the recent congress, insisting his public comments had not brought Safa into disrepute. But Mumble does not agree. He said: “Of the resolutions, six, were passed. And there was no counter-motion that came. Yet we hear there was not unanimity in the congress. That is the deliberate lie that is being propagated out there and we will process that with our discipline processes. As of today he stands charges with a number of violations.” Safa will have their elective congress on 25 May where incumbent president Danny Jordaan will be seeking re-election. Mumble added that everything was in place for the elections to go ahead.
