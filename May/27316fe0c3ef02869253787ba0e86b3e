THEIR squatter camp was earmarked for reblocking to make it more accessible. But residents of Vusimuzi squatter camp in Tembisa said the City of Ekurhuleni’s plans only made their lives worse. Some said it left the shacks in a “Omunye Phezu Komunye” pattern as their shacks were closer than before reblocking started earlier this year. Resident Thami Makau told Daily Sun they were not made aware the reblocking would lead to space reduction. “Those who had larger shacks and stands had their shacks reduced to two rooms and one and a half rooms.” Thami said some shacks were moved too close to the open spaces that were supposed to be streets. Happy Ndebele said she spent seven nights in an unstable structure after her shack was demolished. “I had a six-roomed shack as I lived with my five grandkids.” She said some of her furniture was damaged when her shack was demolished. These angry residents said all they wanted was proper services. Themba Gadebe, Ekurhuleni municipality spokesman, said the reblocking hadn’t been imposed on any community. “The human settlements department responded to a request to urgently prioritise Vusimuzi into the current financial year. It had been targeted for later years. “If the specified need is no longer relevant, resources will be redirected to other communities in need. He said sections within the area have been divided into phases and the contractors were appointed on 8 January to start with phase 1. “There are currently illegal electricity and water connections,” he said. “The project aims to address illegality and provide legal electricity as well additional water standpipes.” He said the ward councillor and committee members representing each section were aware of the process and the community was told.
