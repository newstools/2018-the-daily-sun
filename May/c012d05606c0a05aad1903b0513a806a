The Proteas have dropped down one place to third in the latest ICC ODI rankings that were released on Wednesday. South Africa lost four points to move from 117 to 113, leaving them nine points adrift of India in second and only one point ahead of fourth-placed New Zealand. England have overtaken India to seize the top spot following the annual update. Englandâ€™s rise up the table is largely because of a forgettable 2014-15 season which saw them winning only seven out of 25 ODIs against other full member nations. The 2014-15 season has been dropped from the latest calculations while those from the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons are weighted at 50 per cent. England, who last topped the ODI rankings in January 2013, have gained eight points and moved to 125. India, who were at the top before the update, have lost a solitary point and are in second place with a total of 122. The remaining places remain unchanged, meaning that the current top 10 ranked sides are the ones who will be playing in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019. However, there have been some significant changes in points. World champions Australia have lost eight points to go down to 104 in fifth position and are only two points ahead of ICC Champions Trophy 2017 winners Pakistan, who have gained six points. In other changes, Bangladesh (93 points) have gained three points, Sri Lanka (77) have lost seven points, the Windies (69) have lost five points, Afghanistan (63) have gained five points, Zimbabwe (55) have gained four points and 12th-placed Ireland (38) have lost three points. In the T20I rankings led by Pakistan, there is no change in the top seven places, meaning that South Africa stay sixth.
