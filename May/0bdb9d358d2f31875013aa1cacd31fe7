DRUGS are evil and will destroy your future. These words come straight from the mouths of the drug addicts themselves. Tired of nyaope, these four young men have said enough is enough, and decided to quit drugs. Thato Kutumela (24), Katlego Movhapo (24), Brian Ntuli (27) and Tshepo Nkwane (22), all from Mamelodi East in Tshwane, are committed to ending their dangerous addiction. They told Daily Sun using drugs was the worst mistake of their lives, one that led them to committing crimes just to feed their addiction. Thato said he was desperate to get clean and needed all the help and support he could get. “Drugs are bad and have destroyed my future,” he said. “I regret taking drugs. I want to be clean and become a better person.” Brian, a drug addict for six years, said they spend almost R250 a day just to get high, and that when they needed drugs badly they stole from their families just to score a fix. Gauteng Social Development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said they would send a team to assess the young men and consider them for rehabilitation.
