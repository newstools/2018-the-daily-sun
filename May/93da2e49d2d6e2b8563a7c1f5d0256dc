PORT Elizabeth cops are searching for the suspects involved in a failed cash-in- transit heist on Monday night. A group of armed men travelling in a VW Polo and a Nissan NP300 bakkie tried to slow down a cash truck travelling from Grahamstown to Port Elizabeth. Captain Andre Beetge said the two vehicles tried to box in the cash vehicle near Nanaga farm, in Kinkelbos. “A silver VW Polo tried to slow down the cash transit vehicle from the front, while nine armed suspects in a silver Nissan NP300 bakkie opened fire on the truck from behind and from the side. “When the bakkie got next to the cash transit vehicle, the delivery vehicle’s driver managed to bump the Nissan bakkie until the driver lost control and left the road,” said Beetge. He said it is unknown at this stage whether the suspects fled into the bush or were transported from the scene by another car. “We applaud the driver of the delivery vehicle for his efforts. “After losing the right front tyre, he still managed to drive to safety at Kinkelbos Police Station,” he said. Motherwell commander Major-General Dawie Rabie said: “We are relieved no security guards were injured and no cash was taken in this failed attempt. We will investigate the case in full so the cops can arrest the suspects. “The silver Nissan NP 300 was confiscated by cops for forensic and ballistic investigations,” Rabie said.
