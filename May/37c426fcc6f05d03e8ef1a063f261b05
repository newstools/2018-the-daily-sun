ABOUT 30 years ago, madala Frank Ramapatsi broke up with his girlfriend. However, he later saw she was struggling to raise her three-year-old daughter and he adopted the child. Now the 62-year-old from Naledi in Soweto bitterly regrets this decision. He claimed Brenda Malebane, who is now 38, turned on him and has evicted him from his home. “When I married my current wife, I sent Brenda to live with my mum. After my mum died in 2006, she stayed in the house. “I then decided to build backyard rooms for her and move into my mum’s house myself. “But she locked the gates on me,” he claimed. The Madala claimed he later learnt Brenda was trying to change the ownership of the house. He said he didn’t want to evict her but he might be forced to. “If she continues with this behaviour, I might be forced to do something I don’t want to do,” he said. However, Brenda said Frank was not telling the truth. She said he had never lived with his mum and he fought with her a lot. She claimed Frank didn’t live with his current wife out of his own free will. “Gogo was tired of his bad behaviour and she chased him away. When she died, she had cut him out of her life,” she said. “Now that she’s died, he wants to move back. I can’t let that happen.”
