THE parents of the two girls killed when a wall collapsed on them said they suspect that the weekend rain loosened the bricks. They said they never thought a brick wall would kill their girls. Siziphiwe Libazi (7), Sisanda Ndlala (5) and Sibahle Gumede (6) were swinging on a gate on Kennedy Road, Durban, on Monday afternoon when the wall suddenly collapsed. Siziphiwe and Sisanda were killed during the incident, while Sibahle was injured. Sisanda’s gogo Nolwandle (50) said the houses in the area were old and weak. “We arrived here three years ago but Sisanda started playing with her two friends in January,” she said. “My fear was that she might get raped or kidnapped. I never thought a wall would kill her.” Siziphiwe’s mum, Inga, said: “I am still in shock. I don’t even know how we’ll bury her. My mum and I are unemployed. We would appreciate help from anyone for my daughter to be buried.’ KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed the incident. “An inquest docket was opened at Sydenham Police Station,” she said.
