Three men were arrested with heroin with an estimated street
value of R76.5 million. The trio is expected to appear before the Barberton
Magistrate's Court for a drug related case on Monday. They were arrested  on Saturday morning at around 6:00 by the
Barberton  police and the Whiteriver K9
Unit This came after cops received information about three
vehicles that were transporting drugs coming from Mozambiquè via eSwatini to
South Africa. The vehicles, a silver Toyota Fortuner, a Hyundai H1
minibus as well as a Nissan X-trailer were spotted and stopped by the police
between the Barberton-Badplaas road (R38) en-route to Gauteng, for a search. It was during the
process that police discovered that two of the vehicles had drugs stashed in
different hiding places ranging from false compartments and tyres. A total of 51 packets of heroin were retrieved and as a
result, the trio were arrested. The drugs were seized for further investigation. The Provincial Commissioner of Mpumalanga, Lieutenant
General Mondli Zuma has praised the collaboration between the police and the
community that led to the bust.
