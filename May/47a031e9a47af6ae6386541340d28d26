THE police arrested more than 40 suspects on Friday. A joint operation of about 60 cops from the Parkweg and Mangaung Metro police, as well as officials from Home Affairs, the environmental health department, the liquor board and the fire department bust the suspects in Bloemfontein. Police spokesman Captain Chaka Marope said cops had raided hot spot areas, traced wanted suspects and visited various businesses and buildings to check if they were following regulations. “This was part of crime prevention and ensuring that communities feel free and safe. At least 46 people were arrested during the operation,” said Marope. “Eight of the arrests were for liquor related offences, such as drinking in public and disorderly conduct. “Another eight were bust for possession of dangerous weapons, while seven people were arrested for possession of suspected stolen goods. “Three suspects were arrested for robbery and seven for dealing in drugs. “Police also swooped on illegal immigrants. “Eight people were bust for being in the country without proper documents.” Marope said other suspects were arrested for traffic related offences. “Police stopped and searched 70 cars and 14 traffic fines were issued. “They were mainly for unroadworthy vehicles, driving without permits and driving without licences,” he said. The truck was parked next to the road when an unknown gunman attacked the driver.
