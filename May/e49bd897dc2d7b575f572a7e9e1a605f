The rumour mill has been swirling around Babes Wodumo and her fiancé and boss, Mampintsha for quite some time now. After months and months of rumours claiming that the stars are engaged, our sister publication, Sunday Sun confirmed last month that they were indeed soon to be married. Now, the streets have been talking again and this time, it’s all about a bun in the oven. A certain questionable video has been doing the rounds and it has people wondering if Babes, real name Bongekile Simelane, is not only pregnant but also married to Mampintsha. In the video, Babe and Mampintsha, real Mandla Maphumulo, are showing off a couple of things that have social media wondering if the couple is secretly married and pregnant. First of all, both stars are seen flashing rings on their ring fingers which could indicate marriage. If they were just engaged only Babes would be wearing a ring. Secondly, Babes herself looks rather fuller and thicker with a stomach that is a rounder that usual. Watch the video below and let us know what you think.
