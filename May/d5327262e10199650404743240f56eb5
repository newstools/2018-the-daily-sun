Kuwati preacher Mubarak al Bathali believes Liverpool and
Egyptian soccer star Mo Salah got injured because he ate during Ramadan. The Egyptian forward sprained his shoulder as he clashed
with Sergio Ramos during the first half, before the Reds lost 3-1. The Mubarak al Bathali says the Liverpool star injured
his shoulder during the Champions League final because he broke his Ramadan
fast. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, and
is observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting to commemorate the first
revelation of the Quran to Muhammad according to Islamic belief. Mubarak al Bathali told Sky News that playing football is
"not a legitimate excuse for breakfast" during Ramadan. The Islamic preacher says that "God punished
him" for eating before the game in Kiev against Real Madrid on Saturday. He said there was no excuse because jihadists fast
despite being "in a state of war and facing the enemy". He did add that "the door of repentance is
open". Bathali clarified that Salah breaking his fast to play
football was the sin, but would have been all right if he had eaten breakfast
to travel from the UK to Ukraine. Before the match Liverpool physiotherapist Ruben Pons
confirmed Salah - a hero across the Muslim world - would break his fast for the
final after discussions with a nutritionist. During Ramadan, Muslims fast during daylight hours for a
month in between two crescent moons. However, there are exemptions including travel and severe
illness. The preacher did not mention anything about Salah's
fellow devout Muslim team-mates Emre Can and Sadio Mane, neither of whom were
injured in the final. Real Madrid's Karim Benzema is also Muslim. More than 500,000 people have signed a petition calling
for UEFA and FIFA to punish Ramos, rather than God, for injuring Salah during
the final. However, UEFA confirmed on Tuesday that the Madrid
defender would not be punished for the incident.
