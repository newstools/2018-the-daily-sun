TWO more suspects in last month’s Moses Mabhida Stadium pitch invasion case handed themselves over on Wednesday. Cops released photos of 13 people last week sought in connection with the violence at the Durban stadium after Kaizer Chiefs lost to Free State Stars. The two women, aged 27 and 29, appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court on the same day and were released on R1 000 bail. KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said: “The provincial task team appointed to investigate this matter is working around the clock to make sure all the suspects are brought to book.” Seven other accused – Phelelani Jojisa (33), Sipho Memela (35), John Khumalo (29), Khwezilomso Madida (35), Cebolendoda Hadebe (21), Mhlaliseni Mkhize (42) and Lungigani Jaca (33) – were previously also granted R1 000 bail. The family of Jojisa, who was arrested at the stadium, have claimed he’s an Orlando Pirates fan, and that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
