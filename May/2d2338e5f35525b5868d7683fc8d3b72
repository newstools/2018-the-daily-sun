THE Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) Tracing Unit have arrested a couple aged between 58-59 after a huge amount of money was discovered buried in the yard. Following that cops also raided a house in Payneville in
Springs where they also arrested two female suspects, that were linked to the money. The money was found buried inside container in the yard. EMPD spokesperson Wilfred Kgasago said they received
information from a reliable source in Langaville Ext 8 in the Brakpan area. Initially social media reports suggested that an amount of R1.5 million was found in
the house. The reports further claimed that the house belongs to an 'SBV
Security guard' who was allegedly involved in a heist around Gauteng. However, Kgasago dismissed the reports that an amount of
R1.5 million was recovered from the house, but he couldn't confirm how much
money was discovered. Asked if the man arrested there worked for SBV, he said: "The
couple that was arrested claimed that they were hiding the money for someone
who works for SBV." Kgasago said cops will be conducting further in-depth investigations. Meanwhile SBV
South Africa dismissed social media reports that an SBV employee was involved. "We're aware of a tweet that implicates a SBV
employee in a recent heist. Authorities have confirmed that THIS IS NOT a SBV
employee. Investigations are still underway. Please share. We're committed to
working with authorities to apprehend criminals involved in
#CITRobberies," the SBV tweet said.
