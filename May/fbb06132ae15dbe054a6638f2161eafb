Veteran AmaZulu striker Siyabonga Nomvethe has revealed that he has no plans to hang up his boots as he feels he still has plenty to offer as a player. Nomvethe, who is set to turn 41 in December, started his playing career with African Wanderers back in 1997. The striker is one of few players who has played for Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates as well as Moroka Swallows. The former Bafana Bafana forward also made a name for himself abroad by playing for Italy's Udinese, Salernitana and Empoli. He later moved to Sweden's Djurgarden but returned to South Africa for short stint with the Buccaneers. After less than 20 appearances for the Sea Robbers Nomvethe returned to Europe in a deal with Denmark's AaB 68. In addition to his lengthy club career, the forward earned 81 caps for Bafana Bafana and scored 16 goals. Speaking about his plans to continue playing, he told the Sunday World: "To me football is a gift. "No one told me to start playing football, likewise no one will tell me to stop. "You saw last season that I still have it. You cannot tell that I am at this age (40) because I work hard." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
