SIPHETHO Pheko couldn’t just sit back when he heard motorists complain that potholes damaged their cars. The 37-year-old from Globe Village has been working hard to fix potholes on the R409 between Centane and Butterworth, Eastern Cape. He told the SunTeam he lived near the road and relied on piece jobs to survive. He said he has been fixing the road in the past two weeks in his spare time. “The road is very bad. I’m worried about motorists who drive here at night.” He told Daily Sun he was fixing the road to prevent deadly crashes. “There was heavy rain recently and the potholes got bigger. I’ll continue to work on the road for as long as it’s not permanently fixed.” Although Siphetho hasn’t put up signs warning motorists that work is underway on the road, they wait for him to finish when they see him. “I’m doing this for free but some of the motorists stop and give me money.” Motorist Mandla Nako said he wished the government could see the good work Siphetho was doing. “The situation is bad and we have to buy new tyres every year,” he said. Provincial public works spokesman Mphumzi Zuzile condemned residents who fixed roads themselves. “It’s illegal to fix the road. That’s the responsibility of the department.”
