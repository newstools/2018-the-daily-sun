A NATIONAL Funeral Practitioners Association of SA boss has been charged with murder. The man was bust at his home on Thursday after he and his friends allegedly assaulted and kidnapped Thanduxolo Mkhize (28) from Chesterville, west of Durban, on Tuesday. They accused him of stealing car keys and other goods. Thanduxolo’s mum Thobekile (48) said the accused came with friends on Tuesday, grabbed her son, bundled him into a car and sped off. They were later called by people who asked them to rush to the sports field, where they found the badly injured Thanduxolo. “We found my son with head injuries,” said Thobekile. “We heard he was sjambokked and beaten with a baseball bat. “We rushed him to hospital, but he died on arrival. “We’re devastated by this man’s action because we knew him as a businessman. We never thought he’d kill my son.” Captain Khephu Ndlovu said the suspect appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court on Friday on charges of murder, attempted murder and kidnapping. He said the group also assaulted another man, who was fighting for his life in hospital. “We discourage vigilantism and appeal to people to bring suspects to the police,” said Ndlovu. He said police would arrest more suspects soon. The association’s national secretary, Nkosentsha Shezi, said they won’t comment until they had the full details.
