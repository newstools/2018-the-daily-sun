THE task of building RDP houses is the responsibility of the human settlements department. Eastern Cape Road Accident Fund regional general manager, Yvonne Tankiso-Badi, said in the case of road accident victims, the fund only modifies existing houses. “We are not in the process of building RDP houses. “It is the responsibility of the department of human settlements to build houses. “We operate within the limitation of the national department of transport,” she said. “Our responsibility is to check if surviving road accident victims need extra support at their homes. “We can modify their existing houses to make them wheelchair accessible,” said Tankiso-Badi. She also warned people not to lodge fake car accident claims. “We advise people not to try to lodge fraudulent claims because we will arrest them. “Certain procedures are followed before we approve claims. “For example, a widow who earns more than her late husband is not allowed to lodge a claim of loss of support if her husband died because of a car accident. “That particular individual would be deemed able to support herself and so would not be eligible to lodge a claim for support.”
