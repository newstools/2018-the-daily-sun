As a young boy, Ndumiso Lindi used to watch his father working as an MC. Even at home with his family in Zwelitsha, Eastern Cape, Ndumiso was always surrounded by funny people. Ndumiso said his father Lungile Lindi (76) was often a master of ceremonies and had a collection of joke books. “Before he went to an event, he would memorise some jokes,” said Ndumiso. “He was also a rugby player who travelled a lot. He shared jokes about the people he met and the places he visited.” Then one night, his father woke him up to watch standup comedian Barry Hilton on TV. “I didn’t know the difference between a comedian and an MC. The next day I told my friends about the funny MC I saw on TV.” After matric, Ndumiso moved to the Western Cape to study graphic design at Cape Peninsula University of Technology. He worked in advertising for five years. Then his friend Molete Mathaba convinced him to enter a competition at a comedy show. “I nailed it! The MC asked me to perform for five minutes at Armchair Theatre’s comedy night. I became a regular performer,” said Ndumiso. He said his sets don’t feel like performances. “I just have a conversation with my friends and make sure they have a good time. Comedy is about making your audience relate to your jokes.” Ndumiso and Tumi Morake have partnered for the Married but Not to Each Other comedy show. After performing in Cape Town, Tshwane and Joburg, the show will be held in Botswana. Ndumiso was once a presenter for a TV game show called Wang Verstana. He has performed in countries such as Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana and Uganda. He has also performed at festivals and comedy clubs in Switzerland, London and New York. “Comedy is my ticket to travel the world,” he said.
