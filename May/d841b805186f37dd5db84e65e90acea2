MARITZBURG United are set to bid farewell to one of their own tomorrow when players attend an emotional send-off for Luyanda Ntshangase in Pietermaritzburg. Ntshangase died on Friday due to his injuries after being struck by lightning during a club training match in March. He has been in hospital ever since and finally succumbed after weeks in a coma. His funeral service will be held at the Pietermaritzburg City Hall on the corner of Church and Albert Luthuli streets tomorrow from 10am. His funeral takes place two days before their last Absa Premiership match of the season against Golden Arrows at Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday. It has been a terrible season for United on a personal level but very positive on the field of play, where they have been a marvel to watch. It sees them currently in the top four of the PSL standings. Ntshangase’s death followed that of Mlondi Dlamini, who died in a car accident last October . Team of Choice chairman Farook Kadodia said the real pain his players went through happened the day Ntshangase and four other teammates were struck by lightning. The composure of players following the tragic incident has kept them strong as a team. “We dealt with the situation responsibly,” said Kadodia, revealing that the players have been coping well with the situation at training. “They have been responding well to the coach’s (Fadlu Davids’) tactics.” Kadodia added that they were looking forward to the big KZN derby against Arrows on Saturday. It goes without saying that United will want to win this match as a final tribute to Ntshangase. Kadodia said fans should come in numbers to witness this thriller. The teams played to a 0-0 draw in their last meeting in Durban in December last year. This time around the stakes are high. “We have in our sights a third place finish, and we can achieve that if we win Saturday’s game,” he said.
