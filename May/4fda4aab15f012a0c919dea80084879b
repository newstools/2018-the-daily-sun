WHEN they joined the force, they vowed to serve, protect and abide by the law. But these two Tshwane Metro police officers appeared to have forgotten that they took the oath. It seems greed got the better of them and they were arrested for corruption. The two officers found themselves in hot water after allegedly taking an e-wallet tjotjo from a motorist. Today, they are behind bars and will possibly be stuck with a criminal record. The men of law allegedly received R1 000 via e-wallet from a truck driver. After receiving the money, they reportedly told the driver it wasn’t enough! They went to meet the truck owner at a McDonald’s in Sunnyside, Tshwane, to get an extra R2 000. But the smart businessman caught the two members by surprise when he rocked up with officers from the Road Traffic Management Corporation. Tshwane Metro police spokesman Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said they were aware of the arrest of two of their officers. “We are totally against crime. We will allow the law to take its course,” he said. Mahamba added that on top of the ongoing criminal case opened against the pair, there would be internal investigations. “We are going to investigate them internally as soon as we get the docket from the Independent Police Investigative Directorate. “We will also fully co-operate with the Road Traffic Management Corporation.”
