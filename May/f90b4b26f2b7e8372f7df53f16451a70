“HISTORY will judge you and the International Association of Athletics Council harshly for choosing to go down this route.” These were the words written by Steve Cornelius in his resignation letter. The letter was addressed to Sebastian Coe, the association’s president. Cornelius resigned from the association’s disciplinary tribunal after the organisation introduced new rules forcing women with high testosterone levels to lower them through medical intervention. Cornelius was only appointed to the tribunal in December. “How the IAAF, in the 21st century, can even consider these kind of regulations is a sad reflection on the fact that the old views of the old association still prevail. Your promises of reform have been empty indeed,” said Cornelius. “There is so much dishonesty in the way in which the IAAF has continued to deal with a matter that should have not been addressed by it in the first place. “I cannot see myself being part of a system in which I might be called upon to apply regulations which I deem to be flawed and most likely unlawful. “It would be unethical for me to devote time and energy to expose the principles behind these new regulations while serving on the tribunal.” Parliament’s presiding officers, Baleka Mbete and Thandi Modise, have also spoken out against the association’s decision. They condemned what they described as discriminatory regulations.
