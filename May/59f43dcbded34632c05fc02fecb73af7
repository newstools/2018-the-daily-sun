THE weekend started early for beer lovers in Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Thursday. A truck full of beer overturned on the R40, just outside Acornhoek, at about 5am. Beer lovers including motorists, hitchhikers and residents crazily wrestled over cases of beers. The driver and his assistant appeared confused. They watched helplessly as the vultures descended. Happy Tjie (45) said: “We were on our way to work when we saw the truck avoiding an oncoming vehicle on the gentle bend. Suddenly the truck fell on its side and the booze flew in the air. “Beer was scattered all over the road and everyone ran to help themselves.” People were seen taking crates full of beer into their cars while others dashed into the bush with beers before cops arrived. Bushbuckridge Municipality’s chief fire and rescue officer Reckson Silinda said it took them almost two hours to clear the road. Captain Mpho Nonyane said the truck was on its way to deliver beers in Dwarsloop, Limpopo when it ran out of control. “The truck driver, along with his assistant, was rescued unhurt,” said Nonyane.
