Limpopo MEC for sport, arts and culture is on a mission to improve children’s literacy in the province. Onicca Moloi said her department was alarmed when the results of the 2016 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study were published in December last year. The study was done by the University of Pretoria. It found that 78% of grade 4 pupils in Mzansi were unable to read for meaning. She said her department aimed to buy 32 000 books to fill up the provincial libraries in this financial year. Moloi said she believed their efforts would encourage pupils to read more. “Books empower readers with knowledge and help them develop new ideas.” She urged parents and guardians to instil a culture of reading among children by reading to them regularly. “That will help increase literacy levels in our province,” said the MEC. She said parents can’t use the lack of money as an excuse because books are available to borrow for free at libraries throughout Mzansi. She encouraged those who can afford to buy books to do so as that improve children’s love for words.
