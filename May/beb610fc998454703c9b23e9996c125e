“ALTHOUGH some of us are without shelter, we remain proud and have no regrets for having contributed to the struggle against the outrageously evil system of apartheid.” These were the words of struggle veteran Mkhathali Loliwe at his 96th birthday party on Saturday. The PAC in Buffalo City organised the celebration as Loliwe is one of the party’s few remaining founders. He joined the ANC in the 1940s and is remembered as the person who nominated Nelson Mandela to become president of the Youth League at the party’s congress in Bloemfontein in 1950. When the PAC broke away from the ANC in 1959, Loliwe proposed the party be named the Pan African Congress. The name was later changed to the Pan Africanist Congress by the party’s first president, Robert Sobukwe. Loliwe, who lives in the village of Ncerha outside East London, said he didn’t have a decent home despite having applied for an RDP more than five years ago. Zamikhaya Gxabe, who has written a book about Loliwe, described him as a unifier who always warned people against creating divisions in their organisation. One of the organisers of the party, Sizwe Mfaxa, said they wanted him to know the current generation of PAC members appreciated his sacrifices. “We want to say, well done solider of African emancipation. Though possessing no material gains, you have enriched us with your courage. We remain inspired by your loyalty to the cause of liberation,” he said.
