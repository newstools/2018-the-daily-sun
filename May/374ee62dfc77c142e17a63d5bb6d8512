A FIGHT between two rival gangs – the International Junior Portuguese and the Votas Logos – left one man dead. The 22-year-old man was found stabbed to death at Thubelisha kasi in Thabong, near Welkom, in the Free State on Saturday. Tumelo Mohlomi’s body was found in the street. Tumelo, popularly known as Pidipidi, was allegedly a member of the Junior Portuguese gang. A source told Daily Sun an angry community member who believed that Pidipidi had stolen his son’s cellphone abducted him. He dropped him at Thubelisha kasi – where the Votas Logos gang rules. “He was murdered by gang members,” the source said, adding that Junior Portuguese members then hunted down the community member. “They smashed the windows of his house and damaged the palisade fence. They assaulted the man badly.” A fight between the two rival gangs broke out later. Police spokesman Captain Malebo Khosana said: “Members from the public order police and technical response team were called to assist the police to restore order. “Four men were taken in for questioning in connection with this violence.” Khosana said cases of murder and assault were opened for investigation. Thabong commander Major-General Apaphia Modise urged residents to remain calm. “Criminals will be treated like criminals, and law abiding citizens will get the protection they deserve,” said Modise.
