THESE men are convinced they’ve found a good luck charm. The recyclers who work at the Mangaung dumpsite in Bloemfontein say when they decorate a tree, one of them saw in his dreams, their luck improves and they find things to sell. Pule Seele (37) from Caleb Motshabi kasi said he had been visiting the tree for two months and since then, has been finding enough recyclable goods to support his family. He said he didn’t believe it would work at first but after he tried it, he saw a huge difference in his earnings. “I was told about the tree by my friend I met at the dump. He said if I helped decorate it, I would double my money. I thought he was going crazy. But after a few days, I decided to join him to make him happy and instead of making R80, I made R175. “We go to the tree every morning to dress it with clothes we collect from the dump. My friend told me in his dream, he saw the tree and a diamond lying nearby. “He couldn’t pick up the diamond as there was dirt all around it. But when he cleaned the area, the diamond disappeared and he suddenly had money in his pocket.” Sangoma gogo Moroesi Tapole said the men were not mad. “Ancestors reveal many things in different ways. The dreams mean something good will come their way if they carry on.”
