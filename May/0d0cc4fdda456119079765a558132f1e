UMZIMVUBU Municipality is set to improve service delivery. This was revealed on Thursday during a media briefing in Mount Ayliff. Umzimvubu has set aside the sum of R28,9 million to improve service delivery. The municipality said its clean audit status has been changed to a qualified audit opinion. This is a statement issued after an audit that suggests the information provided was limited. Acting mayor Gcinikhaya Makanda said: “We are committed to developing a turnaround strategy that will give us better results at the end of the financial year.” Makanda said the municipality had noted residents’ concerns. “The people took to the streets to voice their grievances, so we decided to provide better service. “The municipality will construct new access roads and upgrade existing ones. “More than 4000 houses will be built in different villages. “The housing projects are at various stages of completion.” Earlier this year, the community of Ngxabaxha Village barricaded the N2 during a protest for electricity. According to Makanda, 600 households will benefit from the municipality’s electrification project. However, not all is well. During a recent Integrated Development Plan road show, some contracters voiced concern about the awarding of projects. Some threatened to stop working if contracters from other towns were hired. Local economic development head Zandile Garane said they had dealt with the issue. “The contracters discussed the matter and formed one business structure instead of separate entities for each town.”
