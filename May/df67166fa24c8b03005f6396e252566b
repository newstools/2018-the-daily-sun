METRO cops see shocking behaviour every day. But yesterday, even they were shocked when they pulled over a taxi to find the driver had cut out circles from a newspaper to use as licence discs. Social media was abuzz after news about the incident on Malibongwe Drive in Joburg spread. Joburg Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the taxi was impounded and the driver was dealt with. “The taxi was taken off the road and impounded. It will be sent to the department to check its roadworthiness. The fake discs were also taken away. The driver was given a heavy fine,” he said. Facebook users were outraged after hearing what had happened. Mashira Maharaj wrote: “A taxi that drove into me this morning on Malibongwe and Kapital was not even roadworthy and had no licence disc. How does the taxi association allow this?” Ricky Naidoo wrote: “The taxi association should also be fined for having these coffins on the road.” Rudi Smit said: “Anything is possible in South Africa. Ask me, I know.”
