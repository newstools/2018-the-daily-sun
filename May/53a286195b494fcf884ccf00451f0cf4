IF THERE is one thing the current national bus strike has shown without a doubt, it’s that one man’s pain is another’s gain. Just ask the street traders who sell anything from vetkoek to Bible covers at Mzansi taxi ranks. While taxi ranks have swelled with commuters, traders in Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality said they’ve been making big bucks. The strike is now in its fourth week as the bus drivers fight for more money and improved working conditions. Maclean Chambwe (51) of Motherwell said he was up at 4am to prepare his stock to sell at the busy Crossroads taxi rank. “I sympathise with commuters because now they’re spending double their bus fare on taxis.” He said his stock runs out daily. “I sell sweets, fruit and Bible covers. People spend more time in the queue, giving me ample time to sell my stock to them,” he said. Mtutuzeli Ben (46) sells kotas and vetkoek at Cleary Park taxi rank. He told Daily Sun: “Business has been good because people arrive here very early in the morning to catch taxis. “Most of them leave home without eating anything so they buy from me. I’m now able to finish paying off my furniture account.”
