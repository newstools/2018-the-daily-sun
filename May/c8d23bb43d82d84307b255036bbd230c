Family Tree’s Tshegofatso Ketshabile, better known as Tshego, knows what fellow artist Riky Rick is going through, in fact, the singer has Riky to thank for making it through a difficult stage in his career. The Boss Zonke hitmaker is now going through a difficult time of his own and has decided to take a break from music saying he is “not in the right place mentally.” Although Riky had no idea at the time, he once gave Tshego a piece of advice that helped him turn his life around when he was going through a rough patch in his career. "Few years back I was stuck in some deep depression - not trying to get out of bed, not tryna work, in tears for no reason. On top of that I was so involved in hard drugs I’d be up 4 days straight. “If it wasn’t for a text @rikyrickworld sent to tell me to stop slacking and decide if I want to be successful or not, I don’t know if I’d have started the journey to getting better. “Riky himself doesn’t know this story. He has no idea how that text started me back on track with my dream,” Tshego said.
