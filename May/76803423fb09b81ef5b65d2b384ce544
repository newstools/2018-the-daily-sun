FREE State Premier Sisi Ntombela announced her new MECs on Wednesday. She said the changes were made to strengthen governance and improve service delivery. But the DA labelled the whole affair merely rearranging the deck chairs on a sinking ship. Premier Ntombela has reassigned the human settlements responsibility to the public works and infrastructure MEC. Co-operative governance and traditional affairs will now be a stand-alone portfolio with its own MEC. Former Nehawu provincial chairwoman Montsheng Tsiu is the new health MEC and was sworn in as a member of the provincial legislature. Tsiu was previously a manager for nursing services at the health department. Former health MEC Butana Komphela has been moved to social development. Agriculture MEC Oupa Khoabane is now co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC. Former social development MEC Maki Mahasa replaces Benny Malakoane as economics, small business and tourism affairs MEC. Malakoane will now head the agriculture and rural development portfolio. Ntombela thanked the new MECs for their dedication while still in their previous roles. “I wish them well and have confidence they are equal to the task,” she said. But the opposition was far from being impressed with the premier’s not-so-new brooms. They said their appointments would not change anything. The leader of the official opposition, Dr Roy Jankielsohn, said: “The DA has long maintained that the ANC lacks the political will, policies and talent to improve governance in the province and this cabinet reshuffle is just a casein point.”
