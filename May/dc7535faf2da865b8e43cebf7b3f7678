SKOLOPAD is single and available with all her flesh flashing fame! But the popular starlet said she didn’t want just any man. She said she was only available to suitors who were already married. Skolopad, whose real name is Nonhlanhla Qwabe, told Daily Sun that she’d been single for some time now. “I really wouldn’t mind having a man in my life but he should be a married man.” She said one reason she didn’t want someone who wasn’t married was because she couldn’t bear children anymore. “I had cervical cancer which means I can’t have kids. That’s why I want someone who is married and already has kids.” She said all she wanted was to be someone’s official makwapheni. “What I’ve seen is that if you are in a polygamous relationship, you find new sisters. “If one sister can’t do something, the other sister does it. “As for me, I would help by being the trophy wife to go with the husband to special events.” She said her ideal married man should win her heart, be tall and dark and have lots of money! Skolopad, the mum of a 17-year-old daughter, told Daily Sun she had been planning to get married and have more kids but cancer changed her mind. Asked what she would do if her future husband asked her to change her choice of clothing and behaviour, Skolopad said: “I wouldn’t change who I am for anyone. If he loved me, he should love me as I am.”
