GATVOL parents have vowed to punish criminals who steal from their children’s school. They shut down Empumalanga Primary in Motherwell NU9, Port Elizabeth, yesterday to protest against crime in the area. They also complained the education department failed to fix the damages done to the building by thugs. SGB chairwoman Nontuthuzelo Jack said thugs gained entry to the school through a broken fence. She told Daily Sun: “The main problem is the school perimeter fence was vandalised. Criminals find it easy to get into the school. “These thugs have stolen burglar bars, window panes and taps. They have even vandalised the water pipes and toilet seats. It’s our children who end up suffering. We want the education department to secure the school perimeter.” Nosisanda Fountain, who cooks for the school nutrition programme, said she always arrived first in the morning. “Yesterday, I found the water taps vandalised and a dam of water near the classrooms. People who do this are members of the community and we should do a door-to-door search of houses in the area to recover school property,” she said. She also called on the education department to provide the school with a security system to prevent these crimes. The SunTeam was unable to get in touch with the principal as teaching staff were in a meeting yesterday. Department spokesman Loyiso Pulumani said they were dealing with the issue. “I have forwarded the query to the district director of education to look into,” he said.
