DAGGA smugglers have no space to breathe in Nelson Mandela Bay. In less than a week, cops operating in the Motherwell cluster have seized large bags of dagga with an estimated street value of more than R700 000. They also arrested three suspects. Captain Andre Beetge told Daily Sun: “The three suspects, aged 29, 31 and 33 years old, were arrested by the Kinkelbos police who were doing patrols on the N2 near Coega, Port Elizabeth. Their arrest followed a high-speed chase on Tuesday. “Kinkelbos police spotted a silver Opel Corsa speeding past them on the N2. The police chased the vehicle and after managing to stop it they found two large bags containing dagga in the vehicle. The total weight of dagga was more than 60kg. It has an estimated street value of more than R120 000.” The three suspects will appear in court soon. On Saturday night cops found large black bags filled with dagga stashed in the bushes near Coega Road. The total weight was about 300kg with an estimated street value of about R600 000.
