A FAMILY in Phiri section in Kgabalatsane, North West, was left homeless after a fire razed their house to the ground on Sunday evening. The family said they didn’t know what had caused the fire, which started while they were watching TV. Merriam Kgonothi (61) said they were all in the TV room when her son heard a sound from one of the rooms in the house. “He went to check what it was but didn’t find anything. But after a while we could smell smoke,” said Merriam. She said when they left the room, they got the shock of their lives. “There was fire everywhere. We quickly escaped before the whole house caught fire,” she said. She said the fire destroyed all their belongings in just a few minutes. “It spread everywhere in no time, destroying everything in the house. Our documents, furniture and clothes are all gone,” said Merriam. Ward councillor Malebo Ramagofu said she’s printed pamphlets so that the community could help the family. “Please donate things like blankets, beds, paint and cement to repair the house,” Ramagofu pleaded with SunReaders.
