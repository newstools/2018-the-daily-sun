MOKGADI Selepe (31) from Kgaphamadi in Ga-Kgapane outside Bolobedu, Limpopo says her right to clean water has been taken away from her. Workers from Greater Letaba Municipality cut off her water supply and disconnected the meter last year. She said they told her they would send someone to reconnect it, but they did not. They also dug up a hole about two metres deep. “My tap has been dry since last year. Now I am struggling without water and don’t know what to do. “Even though I am unemployed, I am forced to buy water,” she said. Mokgadi told Daily Sun that every time she visited the municipal office to ask about her water problem, she was sent from pillar to post. “Municipal workers often come to my place, but they don’t do anything. Sometimes a worker will ask me for R300 to resolve the water problem,” she said. “What is even worse is that the municipality sends me a water bill every month. “Why are they sending a bill, because I don’t have water?” She said she was now forced to get her water from a well nearby her home. Municipal spokeswoman Lovers Mainetje said the municipality was investigating the matter. “Proper processes will be followed to make sure it is resolved.”
