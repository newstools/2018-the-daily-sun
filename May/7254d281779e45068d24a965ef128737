AMAJITA will kick off their quest to qualify for the 2019 Caf Junior Africa Cup of Nations this weekend. The Under-20s leave the country today for Mozambique, where they will open their qualifier account at the Campo de Ferroviaro Stadium in Beira on Saturday (3pm). Thabo Senong’s team, comprising several new faces, will not be up against strangers in the Mozambicans, who defeated Seychelles 6-0 last month. Senong’s squad is well balanced, with players from the Absa Premiership, National First Division, Multichoice Diski Challenge and the ABC Motsepe League. Jesse Donn of Ubuntu Cape Town will be making his international debut and vowed to keep up the momentum to emulate their predecessors who qualified for the Under-20 World Cup last year. Amajita striker Lyle Foster says they are highly motivated by fact that victory in this match could lead to qualification for the Junior World Cup. He said: “We go into this match straight after victory in the Under-20 Cosafa Cup. As a result our confidence levels are high. “But we realise that anything can happen especially when you’re playing away. “All I know is every football player in this age group would like to play in a World Cup – but first we need to qualify for this Afcon. One step at a time!”
