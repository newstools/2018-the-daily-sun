THE family of a 14-year-old boy who tried to commit suicide wants the education department to investigate teachers for allegedly bullying him. The grade 8 pupil from Durban tried to kill himself on Tuesday by drinking 19 pills after apparently being suspended for not doing his homework and not going to detention at school. The boy’s aunt (41) said he was rushed to hospital after telling his mum what he had done. “On Monday night the mum noticed he was awake and writing something. She told him to go to bed. When she woke him up at 6am the next day, she saw suicide notes on his bed and noticed that something was wrong,” she said. “She asked him what was wrong and he said he was tired of being bullied by teachers and he wanted to die. He told her he drank pills.” The aunt said the notes were difficult to read because he wrote them after taking the pills. “In them he thanked his family for the good life he had at home and said he felt bad that he was failing.” The aunt said the boy had been suspended 12 times and his father went to the school last Thursday asking them to stop because it did not help. “But on Friday they suspended him again. His father asked them to stop punishing him through suspensions as the punishment was too harsh. “He was good at his previous school. His mum knows there is an assignment he did not submit, but she said she was not sure about the homework because she did not check.” The school principal referred questions to the department. Departmental spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said he was not aware of the matter but would investigate.
