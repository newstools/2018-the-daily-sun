A SCHOOLYARD fight turned violent over lunch break at Springs Secondary School on Friday. Although it wasn’t the first time knives and scissors were used in a fight at the school, this one led to three pupils being hospitalised. It seems pupils from a nearby squatter camp and kids from the kasi have been at war at the school in Ekurhuleni for some time. A former pupil said boys at the school first started fighting with knives last year. He said the war started outside school but it soon spilled over into the schoolyard. “I was at school there last year and it was horrible because they cut each other so badly. “Teachers can’t control the situation once it starts.” The SunTeam has a video in which one pupil confronts another and stabs him. Seconds later, another pupil joins and boys start to chase each other with knives. Springs police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said they were investigating what sparked the fight. “We are aware of the incident. Two counts of assault were opened. We can confirm three pupils were injured during the incident and were sent to hospital for medical attention,” he said.
