The South African Police Service (SAPS) in Gauteng has noted with concern various social media posts spreading "false information". A message and a video clip is doing the rounds on social media, falsely claiming that Boksburg Hostel residents were arrested. The message says 22 people were arrested linked to heists in the province. "40 linked to farm murders, household robberies, R47mil found, 76 Zimbabweans, 44 Mozambicans, 120 Nigerians in a one day Operation," Captain Mavela Masondo said. Masondo said the police wish to confirm that that this is fake news and in fact, it is mischievous. "Social Media users have been cautioned on numerous previous occasions to refrain from irresponsible behaviour on social media, even if it is their personal accounts and devices," Masondo said. 22 arrested, linked to 40 Heists, 40 linked to farm murders and house robberies and, also 76 Zimbabweans, 44 Mozambicans, 120 Nigerians at Boksburg Hostel damn hostels hides hostile people. But then again the news need to confirm if this is true. ???????? pic.twitter.com/wXgA3Wa7ly
