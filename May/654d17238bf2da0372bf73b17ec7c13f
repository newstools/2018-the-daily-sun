THEY hang around school doing nothing. They end up involved in fights among each other at school and at home. Apparently, gangs are rampant in the schools of Moloto, in Mpumalanga. But teachers are so scared of being stabbed they can’t enforce discipline. Even the principal is escorted by parents when she leaves and enters the premises because some pupils have threatened to stab her. Daily Sun has seen a letter from Matimba Middle School addressed to parents asking them to come to a meeting last Monday to address the issue of gangs at the school. Titus Mofokeng, a resident, said the principal tried to stop the gangs and fights among pupils, both boys and girls, but they told her to stop interfering or face being stabbed. “The problem is at all the high schools in the area. “The gangs carry knives and screwdrivers to school. They are disrespectful. “I have seen them talking while the principal is trying to speak to them. Some chew gum and page through magazines while you try to reason with them,” he said. A teacher said the gangs do as they please. “They expect to pass even though they don’t study or do any school work.” Daily Sun spoke to a pupil who said the gangs were just friends who protected each other. He said most people fight back because bullies are allowed to do what they want. “There are pupils who smoke dagga and bully everyone. Without friends you have to give them your pocket money and carry their backpacks around,” he said. Mpumalanga Department of Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the department was not aware of any gangs in schools around Moloto. But he said they would look into the matter with urgency.
