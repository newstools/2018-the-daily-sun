CURRENT World Boxing Council international strawweight champion, Deejay “The Real Deal” Kriel, reckons he is done with local fights and wants to focus on international opponents. The 22-year-old fighter from Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, who has just returned from a two-week training camp in the United States, will make his second title defence against Toto Landero from the Philippines at Emperors Palace on 23 June. The up-and-coming pugilist was based at the famous Mayweather Boxing Club in Las Vegas during his training camp. It’s on the back of this educational trip that the young fighter says he wants to fight international opponents to gain more experience in the global arena. “Most of us here in South Africa employ the same fighting style, so mixing it up with international opponents will help expand my boxing knowledge. And that can only happen by fighting different international opponents,” said Kriel. “There are good guys locally, don’t get me wrong, but at the end who is there left to fight? I have only one opponent, my stablemate Simphiwe Khonco, and I don’t want that fight because he is like my brother.” However, the pint-sized boxer says if push comes to shove he will cross swords with the International Boxing Organisation world champion. There have been rumours that the pair might trade leather for the past few months. “I wouldn’t have a choice if my promoter and manager decide to match us. I would have to fight him,” he said. Talking about his trip and upcoming battle, the young fighter said: “The trip was like a boxing education, I learned a lot from the best coaches in the world. I enjoyed every minute. “It’s good to be back, I’m training hard. I don’t know much about the challenger but I promise my fans victory.”
