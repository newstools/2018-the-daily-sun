IN what has been claimed to be a smear campaign to damage the image of Bloemfontein Celtic, the club is again accused of missing the deadline to pay their technical team’s salaries for the past two months. Celtic have been more in the news for not paying staff salaries than winning matches, as a matter of reality. SunSport spoke to two technical team members recently, who spoke on condition of anonymity, and they claimed they were still waiting for their March and April salaries. But club CEO, Khumbulani Konco, has rubbished the allegations. “I deny all the allegations in the strongest possible way. This is nothing new to us. Those people have been singing from the same hymn book since the start of the season. It is all not true,” he said. In fact, the technical team, working closely with head coach Veselin Jelusic, have threatened to boycott their last 2017/18 Absa Premiership match against Mamelodi Sundowns in the Free State on Saturday (3pm). In anyway, the match is of no significant meaning to Sundowns, who have already won the PSL championship, but Celtic have everything to play for, as victory could see them sneak into the top eight bracket. Said a club member: “We’ve approached the CEO couple times and has promised to look into our matter, but nothing is happening. To be honest, we don’t even know if we’ll get paid this month.” Another technical member added: “Even some players are still waiting for their bonus money. We’re all in this business of football for money, even though it’s our passion. “We always have to be the first to approach management, and they hardly care. Not long ago it was the players who complained and ultimately they were paid. “It’s evidently clear that the club is in a financial conundrum, hence MTN pulled out. Max Tshabalala also doesn’t care to attend to the employees’ concerns. Coach Veselin is also not standing up for his colleagues, maybe because his salary is paid.”
