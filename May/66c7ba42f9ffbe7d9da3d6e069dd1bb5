BLACK Leopards captain Mark Munyai has urged his teammates to not dwell too much on last weekend’s result but rather focus on their next game against Jomo Cosmos. Lidoda Duvha went into last weekend’s match against Highlands Park knowing that a point would see them qualify for the National First Division (NFD) promotion play-offs. But Highlands proved too strong for them, defeating them 2-1, which has now put the Venda outfit under pressure. Now they need to claim maximum points against on-form Cosmos at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday (3pm). Considering they ended last year at the foot of the table and have since moved up to third spot, Lidoda Duvha have what it takes to qualify for the play-offs. If Joel Masutha’s charges fail to get maximum points, fourth-placed Real Kings or Witbank Spurs could jump in and seal the remaining play-offs spot. Talking to SunSport yesterday, the Leopards skipper declared war on Ezenkosi. He said: “We were too relaxed against Highlands Park because we knew, at the time, that we needed only a point in two matches to qualify for the play-offs. That was our downfall. “Everyone knows what is at stake. Qualifying for the play-offs and ultimately making it back into the PSL would change our lives drastically. We need to do this for ourselves and for the future. “Cosmos are not an easy team but we need this more than they do. We will fight with everything we have to ensure we qualify for the play-offs spot.” On the other side, Ezenkosi, who will just be honouring the fixture to cement their second place in the standings, have vowed not to show Leopards any mercy. Cosmos midfielder Tebogo Tlolane said: “We have qualified but that does not mean we should relax by taking them lightly.” The promotion/relegation play-offs, which sees the team that finishes 15th in the PSL go into battle against the teams that finish second and third respectively in the NFD, run from 16 May until 2 June.
