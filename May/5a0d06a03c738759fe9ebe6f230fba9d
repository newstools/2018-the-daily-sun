SCHOOL kids at Kosea Moeka Primary School in Motla, North West, were turned back on Thursday and Friday morning. Their teachers found five dead goats on the school premises! And it was not the first time this has happened. Nine dead goats have been found on the premises in the past two months. Pupils and parents were in shock when the SunTeam visited the school last week. SGB chairman Oarabile Mokaila (39) said: “This started in March after the holidays. “On Thursday we found three dead goats, and the next day we found two.” Oarabile said the cause of their deaths remains a mystery. “Why do they die inside the yard and not out there, on the streets?” he said. “We don’t even know what’s killing them.” He said parents now fear for their kids’ lives. “If that thing, whatever it is, could kill such big animals, what about little kids? What if it kills them too?” Oarabile said the kids were traumatised. “This is affecting their schoolwork. They can’t focus in class,” he said. He said the problem was slack security. “We’d feel safe if there was proper security.” Resident Maria Mogapi (40) said: “Animals never die in our yards or our streets. “It’s amazing what’s going on at the school. “We hope something gets done before we lose one of our children.” SPCA inspector Meshack Matlou said: “It looks like the goats sleep in the school yard. “And dogs come in and attack them. We found dog bites on their bodies.” Matlou pleaded with owners of the animals to keep them inside safe enclosures in their yards. “I’m going to call an urgent meeting on this issue because owners let animals roam around.”
