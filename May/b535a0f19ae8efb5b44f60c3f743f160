THE future of 103 factory workers in Phoenix, Durban, hung in the balance for some time. Mthembu Tissue Converting, which makes toilet paper, apparently had cash flow problems. And there was talk of retrenchments, according to the workers. But thanks to R13 million in funding from the trade and industry department, the factory is well on its way to recovery. Worker Smangele Tshabalala (52) said on Friday: “The department has invested lots of money in the company and we hope to benefit as workers.” Another worker, Siyabonga Ngcobo (37), said: “Looking at the way factories are retrenching workers, I was scared. “I feared we’d also be retrenched and sit at home.” Owner and founder General Mthembu said he had 37 workers when he started the factory in 2005. And they had to pay back a loan and were not making profits. Deputy trade and industry minister Bulelani Magwanishe said the factory had passed funding criteria. “One of the requirements is that the company must be 50% black owned and support a community project.”
