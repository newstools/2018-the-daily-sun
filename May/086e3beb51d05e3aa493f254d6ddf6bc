THE situation in Chats-worth, south of Durban, turned tense when a commotion between two taxi associations broke out. Chatsworth and Santi and Klaarwater Association members were at each other’s throats over routes yesterday. This led to Chatsworth security guards allegedly shooting and injuring two of the other association’s drivers. Other drivers from that association were arrested. Allegedly they were stopped from working in Chatsworth in March by the Chatsworth Taxi Association. But yesterday Santi and Klaarwater members arrived in Chatsworth with their taxis, demanding to work. And when the other association’s members saw them, the commotion broke out outside RK Khan Hospital as the security guards opened fire. According to the Santi and Klaarwater Association, they have been working with the other association for over 20 years but were suddenly asked to stop working in the area. Member Sibusiso Mfeka said they did not understand why they were told to stop working in Chatsworth. “We came today because our passengers demanded we continue working in Chatsworth because they travel easily to this area. “We also have a permit to work in this area,” Mfeka said. Meanwhile, Chatsworth public relations officer Bashir Ismail said the other association was not allowed to operate in their area. “We’ve worked with them but we stopped them from working here because they don’t have a permit,” said Ismail. The conflict between the associations has also affected patients that come to RK Khan Hospital. They could not get taxis to take them home. Patient Mapheta Ngcobo (64) from Klaarwater said: “I will ask the police to take me home because there are no taxis here.” Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a shooting took place opposite RK Khan Hospital in Chatsworth, where a guard shot and injured a taxi driver and another man. “Police are at the scene to stabilise the situation,” said Mbhele. KZN health spokeswoman Ncumisa Ndelu said there were no interruptions at the hospital.
