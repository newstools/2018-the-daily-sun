The Hawks have arrested six suspects in Klerksdorp and
Upington in connection with a bank robbery that took place in April this year. The suspects allegedly colluded and stole more than R3
million at the local Nedbank Branch. Two suspects allegedly posed a SBV security officers to
do a routine pickup.  They produced fake
documents and were handed money by the bank staff. Following the robbery, an intelligence-driven Hawks
operation, assisted by the Gauteng technical response team, led to the arrest
of Welcome Marcus, 50, and Charles Anthony Scheepers, 54, two weeks ago. On Sunday the operation continued and led to the arrest
of a further six, two of whom are employed by the bank. The Hawks’
Priority Crime Specialised Investigations (PCSI) unit is already conducting a
financial and asset forfeiture probe on all the suspects. Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso  said all eight suspects, Marcus and Scheepers
included, will appear at the Klerksdorp magistrate today facing charges of
theft, meanwhile more arrests are imminent. North West Hawks Head Major General Linda Mbana warned
that the chips are falling and it is only a matter of time before everyone who
was involved gets rounded up.
