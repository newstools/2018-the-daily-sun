ELSIE Manyako died on Monday morning. The 78-year-old from Wonderkop, near Brits in the North West, had been suffering from terrible pain and wounds on her legs for 25 years. Her plight was highlighted in Daily Sun on 13 March when, with her daughter Mmapula who also has the same condition, she approached the paper for help. They were admitted to Job Shimankana Tabane Provincial Hospital in Rustenburg last Wednesday. Speaking to Daily Sun, family member Lebogang Manyako said the family was shocked after her death. “We were not expecting it. Instead we were still hoping something positive would happen. “She was such a good person who was forever laughing,” said Lebogang. She said they were not sure what caused her death. Elsie leaves behind eight children. The hospital’s CEO, Dr Bogosi Moagi, said the matter will be investigated.
