Before Sechaba Pali became a famous gospel artist, he lived in the garage of the late Bigboy Mlangeni. And now, Pali is once again living in the same yard in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. Yesterday Daily Sun reported that he was evicted from his house earlier this week – and after being evicted Pali and his family were taken in by Bigboy’s son Thokozani. Although Pali earlier said he didn’t know why he had been kicked out of his house, he yesterday told Daily Sun he has not been paying the bond for nine months as he doesn’t have money. “The bank called in October with a final warning that they would auction the house if I didn’t make an arrangement to pay the money I owed,” he said. Pali said that a man came to his house in December, saying he had bought it at auction but the bank had not informed him of this. He said no one came back to him and he was thrown out on Tuesday by 50 men dressed in yellow. The SunTeam spoke to Standard Bank and the consultant confirmed Pali had bought his house through the bank. But the consultant said they were not allowed to share further details. Pali said three security guards were standing guard outside his house since he was evicted. He said Bigboy was the only person who helped him when he started out.
