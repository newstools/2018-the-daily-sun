THE family of Sindiswa Mnguni is angry with an ambulance company Emerald for allegedly refusing to help her. The 62-year-old from Eugene squatter camp in Butterworth died at the local hospital last Saturday, a day after being admitted. Her daughter, Nonyameko (23), said her mum had a policy with the company and had been paying R110 a month for the past five years. “Two weeks ago my mum fell ill and when we called the company, an official told us they would only transport people who had stab or bullet wounds. “The official also said they transported people who suffered a stroke, had shortness of breath or had been in an accident,” said Nonyameko. “They refused to come and fetch my mum. I don’t think my mother was told about those conditions. “We called a government ambulance and an official said they were on strike. We eventually hired a taxi to take my mum to hospital.” Nonyameko said they were angry with the ambulance company. “My mother paid for nothing. We blame Emerald for her death. “We are angry and disappointed. We want her money back.” Neighbour Nomthandazo Baleka said the company should take responsibility for Sindiswa’s death. “She spent hours at home as we struggled to find a taxi to take her to hospital.” Yolanda Jonase of Emerald’s complaints department said: “Indeed, the ambulance only transports patients who have suffered a stroke, gunshot wound, tight chest or those who have been in a car accident “Unfortunately, the company failed to explain these terms and conditions to the client.” Sindiswa will be buried in Mcobothini, Lusikisiki on Friday.
