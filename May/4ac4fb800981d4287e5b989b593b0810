COMMUTERS in Mbombela, Mpumalanga fear for their lives. Another Buscor bus was burned in Tekwane South on Wednesday afternoon. The bus was on its way to collect pupils when it was attacked. The incident came hours after the house of bus driver Michael Mkhabela (42) was set alight on Wednesday morning. The fire also affected his neighbour’s house. Yesterday residents barricaded streets in Tekwane South, demanding that the bus company’s management do something about the burned houses. A resident said they no longer felt safe in buses. “We are scared because we are putting our lives at risk. “We do not know what might happen when we catch the bus,” said the resident. “We are not safe in the buses. It’s wrong to burn buses because this is our only reasonable mode of transport.” She said everything had been as normal before the incident happened. “We hope that a solution will soon be found before anyone gets hurt.” Vian Ndlovu, a spokesman for Buscor, said they were doing their level best to protect their workers and commuters as well as their buses. “We have hired more security guards to assist during these trying times,” said Ndlovu. Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe condemned the torching of a bus. He said people should stop blockading roads and damaging property when they want issues resolved. “We have opened a case of malicious damage to property. “No arrests have been made, but we are appealing to anyone with information to contact Captain Hendry Sithole on 082 469 1542,” said Bhembe.
