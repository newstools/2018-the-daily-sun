SUNNYSIDE residents have had enough of a notorious block of flats that keeps claiming the lives of young people. Shaun Chabalala (23) lost his life on Monday when he was pushed from the seventh floor of a block next to the Tambotie flats in Sunnyside, Tshwane. A witness, who wrote about the incident on social media, said Shaun and a friend went to the flats after seeing an advert online for a luxury camera being sold for R12 000. The witness said the two men travelled all the way from Joburg but when they arrived at the flat, they were allegedly robbed of their money and their phones by Nigerian men and a South African woman. Sunnyside police spokesman Captain Daniel Mavimbela said the police had launched a manhunt for the suspects. He said Shaun was pushed through a window but his friend managed to escape. He was certified dead at the scene. “No one has been arrested yet but cases of murder and robbery were opened,” he said. Mavimbela said cops were searching for a man known only as Ekene, as they believed he could help with the investigation. “Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects is urged to contact Sunnyside police on 012 422 3604, Crime Stop on 08600 1011 or SMS Crime Line at 32211,” he said. Resident Thabo Morudu claimed many people were killed and robbed by residents of the flat every year.
