ANOTHER life has been lost in a cash-in-transit robbery. A 40-year-old guard was shot dead during the robbery in the Joburg CBD on Tuesday. A cash van was collecting money at the Carlton Butchery at the corner of Von Wielligh and Fox streets at about 9am. The suspects allegedly posed as customers while the security guards were collecting money. After the guards were finished, the two suspects grabbed the cash, shooting a guard during the scuffle. They fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of money. Joburg Central police spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele said the suspects were still at large. “Police have opened cases of murder and robbery after a guard was shot dead and money was stolen. “We appeal to anyone who has information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects to come forward.”
