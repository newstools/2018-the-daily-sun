FOUR children and two adults were killed after a car caught
alight on the N4 towards Buffelspoort on Sunday. ER24's Russel Meiring said it is believed that the driver
lost control of the car and crashed into a pillar before the car set alight. Meiring said the paramedics arrived at the scene and saw
that there was nothing they could do to save the patients. "A woman who was killed in the incidentÂ  was believed to be pregnant and three
children, all believed to be between the ages of 6 to 9 years old, were also in
the car," Meiring added. The woman, children and a man were declared dead on the
scene by various emergency services. The exact circumstances surrounding the incident were not
yet known to our paramedics but local authorities were on the scene for
investigations.
