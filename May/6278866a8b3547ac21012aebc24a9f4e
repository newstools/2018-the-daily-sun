SOCIAL Development Minister Susan Shabangu has been asked to take action against former minister Bathabile Dlamini and former SARS acting CEO Pearl Bhengu. Sassa yesterday appeared before parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts to account for R1,3 billion in irregular expenditure. The committee heard the two had spent millions of rands irregularly, including R16 million on things called education meetings. Among the things approved in one day were a marquee for R485 000, flooring for R482 000 and chairs and decorations for R487 000. DA MP Timothy Brau-teseth said: “Dlamini and Bhengu cannot escape accountability for turning Sassa into their personal piggy bank.” Brauteseth produced an email sent in December by a Mr L Malope from an events company asking for five events to be organised in KZN to educate beneficiaries about the new Sassa system at R4 million per venue, and the next day it was signed off. He said the letter simply stated the places where the events were going to take place. Acting CEO Abraham Mahlangu said he would have the allegations investigated. Brauteseth said Bhengu approved R71 million in flood relief in December without following proper procedures. Shabangu said: “Those who have worked with me know we are not going to leave these issues to the committee. We will deal with them.”
