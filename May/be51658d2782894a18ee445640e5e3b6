WHEN residents heard rumours that there was gold in their area, they rushed to get some for themselves. However, the gold rush apparently ended in tragedy yesterday when one resident allegedly died after being hit by a rock in a stampede. Three others were injured. The residents of KwaMachi near Harding in southern KwaZulu-Natal, said they heard that a person working on a road construction project in the area had found gold. A resident told Daily Sun: “He saw a stone that looked like gold last Wednesday and told his colleagues, who told residents of the area.” The resident said community members were selling pieces of rocks that looked like gold for between R50 and R100. “People flocked to the area last week and started digging. There were ululations and whistles when residents found what looked like gold,” he said. The resident said people from other areas started arriving in cars with spades on Monday and more arrived yesterday. Umuziwabantu mayor Dixie Nciki said they had to call the police and fence off the area. “We have been trying to tell residents not to dig because it’s dangerous. “But they are saying that they want to get rich and are prepared to die for the gold,” she said. Nciki said they would send security guards to the area to keep people away. She said she had seen the stones but she didn’t know if they were really gold. “However, it’s heavy and looks like gold.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said no case was opened. When Daily Sun asked Mbhele about the resident who allegedly died, she said: “I confirm there was a stampede. “But I cannot confirm if a resident died until I have a full report on the matter.”
