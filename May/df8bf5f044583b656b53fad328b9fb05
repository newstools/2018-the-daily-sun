A 17-year-old schoolgirl mysteriously disappeared a few hours after returning from school. Logan Butteress was last seen after being dropped off by her lift club on Wednesday in Bethelsdorp, Port Elizabeth. Cops have urged anyone with information on her whereabouts to urgently contact them. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu told Daily Sun: “Logan was dropped off after school on William Slammert Drive. It’s not far from her home at Siyazama Street in Timothy Valley, Bethelsdorp. “She was still in her Westview High School uniform. She didn’t go home and that was the last time anyone saw her.” Naidu said her parents reported her missing on the same evening. “Anyone who can assist in tracing her or may have information on her disappearance is asked to contact Warrant Officer Grant Measures on 072 732 4220, CrimeStop on 08600 10111 or the Crime Line on 32211. “They can also contact their nearest police station,” said Naidu.
