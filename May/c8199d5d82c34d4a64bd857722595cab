THERE were nine murders and three attempted murders believed to be linked to taxi violence in Cape Town on Friday and Saturday. Western Cape police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana told Daily Sun a task team led by detectives had been set up to investigate the incidents. The first shots were fired at a 28-year-old man at Wynberg taxi rank at about 4pm on Friday. He escaped unharmed, but before the sun rose the next day nine people had been killed. At 5pm a 40-year-old taxi driver was shot and killed on Govan Mbeki Road in Philippi. Five minutes later, a 43-year-old man was shot and killed on the same road. More people were murdered late on Friday night and in the early hours of Saturday morning on Luzuko Drive and on Sonwabile and Entokozweni streets. Most of the victims were Avanza drivers who belonged to the Cata and Codeta taxi associations. Taxi driver Mzwandile Masombuka (37) said: “I cannot tell you the exact reasons for this. People are losing their lives and we are not safe.” When asked why Avanza drivers were targeted, another taximan said it was because taxi bosses also owned that model of car and they were sometimes used for hits. Passenger Nomalungisa Sangoni (34) said she had to run for her life when the taxi she was travelling in was attacked. “People came out of nowhere and killed our driver,” she said. Sergeant Rwexana said police teams had been sent to hot spots and two suspects, aged 39 and 45, were arrested in Gugulethu. Anyone with information about the incidents should phone the police on 08600 10111.
