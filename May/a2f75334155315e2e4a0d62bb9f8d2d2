BAXOLELE Jakuja’s family blames the municipality for his death. The 29-year-old was allegedly killed by cops on 10 May during a service delivery protest in Phepheni Village, Mount Ayliff, as people protested against the planned number of houses to be built in their village. Baxolele’s aunt, Nobongile Bhebe, said he was not even part of it. “He was on his way to town to collect his R400 salary. I am very angry because an innocent person died and the people who killed him are not doing anything about it. “The municipality only came to see us once and no promises were made. The police are the government’s people, so they must take responsibility.” Nobongile said they were told the bullet that killed Baxolele had not been found and his body was transferred to Mthatha for more checks. “We cannot afford a funeral, and as a family we want the people who killed him to bury him,” she said. Umzimvubu municipal manager Thobela Nota said they had taken note of the unfortunate incident and sent condolences to the family. Nota met the Phepheni residents over their issues. “They are complaining about the number of houses to be built and say 500 houses aren’t enough and want an RDP house for each resident. After this meeting we will be visiting the family to show support and deliver groceries.” Captain Edith Mjoko said: “Police are investigating and no bullet was found in the body. A case was opened.” She said the case was not with Ipid yet and once the checks were done, more steps will be taken.
