THE 27-year-old traveller who was bust with a bag full of cash worth about R6,9 million is expected to appear in the Joburg Commercial Crimes Court today. The man is likely to face a charge of contravening the Customs and Excise Act. He failed to declare the bag full of money at OR Tambo International airport on Friday. The suspect was said to be heading for Mauritius. According to national police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, the cash was in American and South African currencies. “This was during a continuing and successful implementation of an integrated plan at OR Tambo airport. “The team, acting on intelligence, intercepted luggage suspected of containing undeclared cash,” said Naidoo. He said on opening the bags it was found they contained an amount of US$199 300 and R4 500 400, bringing the total value to R6 992 569,34. According to Naidoo, police were working tirelessly with other law enforcers to fight crime at the country’s port entries and exits. “The SAPS, SARS and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations and port security continue to work tirelessly to ensure that crime is not committed. “This includes the smuggling of illicit contraband and undeclared cargo.” Naidoo said the suspect still has to go through a verification process to see if he is South African or a foreigner. According to SARS’s website, one is allowed to take up to R160 000 per adult and R50 000 per child under the age of 12 each calendar year from South Africa. However, prior clearance from an authorised dealer must be produced to customs as proof. Without such clearance, only an allowance equalling R25 000 is allowed per person.
