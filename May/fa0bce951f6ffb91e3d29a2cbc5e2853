COPS have released photos of Kaizer Chiefs fans wanted in connection with the violence at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban last month. The police released 13 pictures taken on the day of the incident, two of women and 11 of men. Police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said they believed the 13 would help the provincial task team investigate the violence that took place after Kaizer Chiefs lost to Free State Stars. Naicker urged anyone with information about the whereabouts of the people pictured above to contact the police immediately. He also urged the people in the photos to hand themselves in. Following the shocking scenes at Moses Mabhida, Phelelani Jojisa (33) was arrested and charged with pitch invasion and malicious damage to property. He appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court last month and was granted R1 000 bail. A few days after Jojisaâ€™s arrest,three more suspects, truck driver Siphosenkosi Memela (35), taxi rank manager John Khumalo (29) and taxi driver Khwezilomso Madiba (35) were arrested. They appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court on Wednesday and were released on R1 000 bail each. It is alleged Memela was the one seen breaking a TV camera in videos of the incident. The three will appear in court with Jojisa on the 25th of this month.
