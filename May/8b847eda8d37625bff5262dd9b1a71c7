THOSE big mkhabas which cops carry around their waists must go – and they must get fit! This is according to the SA Police Service, which is getting serious about its members fighting the flab. Enlistment requirements currently state that applicants must be young, energetic, intelligent and fit. Police spokeswoman Colonel Athlenda Mathe told Daily Sun the SAPS had developed a new policy to give all members the opportunity to exercise. “Members have been enrolled in a six-week healthy lifestyle programme to assist them in improving their wellness,” she said. Mathe said the police had also introduced gyms at head offices and also at some provincial offices. “Exercise sessions have been introduced for senior management during strategic planning sessions.” Mathe told Daily Sun they had negotiated with fitness companies to give a discount to police members. “The SAPS has 21 funded sporting codes that members may participate in to keep their fitness levels high. Sport is used as a vehicle for fitness,” she said. Mathe said members were encouraged to know how healthy and fit they were. “Health and fitness status checks are done through scientific assessments,” she said. Joburg Metro Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said they were also working hard to make sure that members were healthy. “We have the employee assistance programme which our officers attend to keep healthy,” he said. Minnaar said they also offered members the opportunity to participate in different sporting codes to encourage healthy living. “Our sports and physical activity committee deals with sporting activities in our department,” he said. “We do not encourage mkhaba. “Different sporting codes such as soccer, netball and volleyball run throughout the year.” He said officers often took part in games where they competed against other police departments.
