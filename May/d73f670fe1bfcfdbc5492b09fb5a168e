ONTLAMETSE Phalatse’s legacy lives on. Ontlametse died in April last year at the age of 18. She was one of two young South African girls living with progeria, a genetic disorder that leads to aging symptoms at a young age. In the last year she was alive, she worked with production company Prosperities Productions to create a documentary about her life. Ontlametse wanted it to be titled My Attractive Life. The documentary is now available for everyone to watch. On Friday, Prosperities screened it at Tlhako-A-Thamaga Primary School in Hebron, North West. The company’s Keabetswe Mokwena said Ontlametse was excited about the documentary before she died. “I was following her on Instagram and asked her if we could start a documentary about her life and she was happy about it. “We met with her family and they gave it their blessing.” Keabetswe said it was tragic that Ontlametse died before they could finish the film. “We had to carry on with it because that was what she wanted,” she said. “The documentary shows a different side of Ontlametse. “People will get a chance to know more about her life.” The education department is also celebrating her life. According to North West education and sport development MEC Sello Lehari, the film will be the basis of their school drive. “We have drawn up a broad list of schools to visit, with a special focus on those in the rural parts of our province. “We understand that most of our pupils come from homes where there is no motivation to see education as the path to a better life. “We trust Ontlametse’s story will help them see the light,” said Lehari. North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo told Daily Sun: “Ontlametse’s story is special, very powerful and should be preserved and celebrated. “She did not allow her illness to stand in the way of her dreams, especially education. “Watching the documentary, you cannot help but get an injection of inspiration. She had that can-do attitude.”
