LIFE is hard for a young girl and her four siblings. The 13-year-old from   Siyanda B, north of Durban has been forced to look after her siblings since their mum left them in January this year. Her siblings are between the ages of two and 12. The young girl has to go around the area asking for food from the neighbours. A neighbour told Daily Sun they were worried about the kids’ safety. “What angers us most is that out of the five siblings, only the 12-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl attend school. “The girl doesn’t attend school because she is forced to look after her younger siblings,” said the neighbour. She said the mum has been leaving the kids alone since the death of their father in 2016. “But this time she has been gone for a long time. We have tried to find her, but with no luck. “The mother is originally from Bergville,” said the neighbour. Another neighbour said the kids’ mum is irresponsible. “These kids should be taken away from her because she can’t look after them,” he said. “Since the death of their dad in 2016, the mum has been leaving the kids alone. We don’t know her relatives or the late father’s relatives.” He said they were worried that evil men might attack the kids. “We hope the social development department will help these kids.” Ncumisa Ndelu, a spokeswoman for KZN Social Development Department, said the matter has been referred to their eThekwini North office. “Social workers will investigate and take appropriate action to protect the children. We wish to express our gratitude to a neighbour who brought this matter to our attention,” said Ndelu.
