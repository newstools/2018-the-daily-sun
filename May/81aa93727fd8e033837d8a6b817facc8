RAPE was the biggest talking point at a community meeting in Kwa- Nobuhle, Uitenhage on Friday. The meeting was held at Babs Madlakane Hall. Resident Nontsikelelo Mduma, from Gunguluza, said her biggest fear was being sexually assaulted. “I always pray I do not get raped as the experience is shattering. Rape victims feel like they have lost all their dignity,” said Nontsikelelo. “This community is baffled by the police’s inability to act swiftly and effectively.” Another resident said schoolgirls in the area were at risk of being raped. “Jikeleza taxi drivers are luring young girls to secluded places so they can rape them. A large number of rape cases has been opened at KwaNobuhle Police Station this year. It is shocking that girls as young as 13 are being raped,” said the resident. Bishop Bonisile Made said a lot of so-called men of God were actually wolves in sheep’s clothing. He said: “It is shocking to hear that some pastors and bishops are rapists. This is discouraging because a church is supposed to be a house of hope.” Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said: “We kindly request the complainants to contact the KwaNobuhle station commander and address their concerns with him. “The police station has a good relationship with different departments and they visit the local clinics and hospital on a regular basis. “It is advisable that public institutions also report their concerns to the station commander.”
