A suspected thief fell off a moving truck while offloading pineapples. THREE men were caught on camera stealing pineapples from the moving truck. The three men used a white sack and two jackets to load the pineapples and then threw their loot off the slow-moving vehicle. The man can be seen throwing his loot to the ground before falling off and rolling a couple of metres. His accomplices seemed to have mastered the skill of jumping off the moving vehicle as they had no problems doing so. According to the eyewitness who shot the video, the men were likely emboldened by the relatively light road traffic at the time. "They decided to jump off as the truck slowed down because of the steep hill, the one guy fell onto the road and we had to swerve to avoid hitting him," he told News24, asking to remain anonymous. The incident tookj place at a stop-and-go section of the R72 just outside Hamburg in the Eastern Cape on Monday. Upon overtaking the truck, the witness signalled to its driver, who seemed to be aware of what was going on at the back of his vehicle. According to the witness, the driver merely offered a shrug in resignation before continuing up the hill, on his way to deliver the pineapples to the Summerpride factory in East London. Summerpride CEO Anthony Alberts told News24: "The problem is not just confined to the pineapple trucks because cargo is stolen from all sorts of trucks passing through the stop-and-go road works along the R72." "Sadly, it is the farmers who take the knock as the trucks are only weighed on arrival at the factory," he said.
