THE dam that burst on Wednesday, killing at least 44
people, may have been illegal. According to Daily
Nation, Kenya's chief prosecutor today instructed that investigations begin
to look into the cause of the Patel Dam tragedy in Solai, Nakuru County. Three dams were built by the owner of the large coffee
farm on which they stand, Patel Mansukul. According to Kenya’s laws, dams above five metres high
are required to be licensed by the Water Resources Management Authority (Warma). It has emerged that none of the dams are licensed, and
that Warma had tried in vain to get Mansukul to comply. Simon Wang’ombe, Warma’s regional manager, said: "For
the last one year, we have been trying to engage the company on how to legalise
the dams on its farm but they have been reluctant. As far as we are concerned
the dams are illegal." Warma officials were particularly worried because they
had noticed that the dams were leaking, putting at risk the residents who lived
beneath them. Another of the dams is going to be drained to prevent a
repeat of Wednesday’s disaster. Besides the 44 bodies that have been recovered, a further
40 have been reported missing, probably swallowed by the mud and debris. The Kenyan Red Cross estimates that up to 500 families
were affected by the disaster. The report into the disaster is expected within 14 days. Meantime, weeks of pouring rain has killed at least 175
nationwide and destroyed roads and houses.
