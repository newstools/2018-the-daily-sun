MADALA Gabriel Moloto has learned not to trust sangomas who demand a lot of money. The 68-year-old said he spent almost R100 000 consulting sangomas who did nothing for him. Madala Gabriel, from phase 6 in Mangaung, said he started consulting sangomas in 2012 after he had felt something moving in his stomach for about six months. He said he saw a pamphlet that advertised the services of a sangoma in North West. “Instead of getting help, I was made to pay R20 000. I then decided to consult another sangoma in Free State. “When I got there, the sangoma told me to stop poking my wife for six months. But then I started dreaming about poking monkeys,” he said. The madala said the dreams prompted him to seek the services of yet another sangoma. “I had to sell my car to pay the sangoma, but in the end nothing helped. “I almost sold my house, but my wife stopped me.” The gatvol madala said he is tired of fake sangomas who are only interested in taking money from the vulnerable. “I now believe in prayer,” he said. Samkelisiwe Moloto (38), the madala’s wife, said she was furious when she found out that her husband had been instructed not to sleep with her for six months. “I tried warning my husband about those fake sangomas, but he would not listen,” she said. “They told him I was the one who was causing his problems. “He even went to loan sharks to get money to pay the sangomas,” said Samkelisiwe. Gabriel said he had learned his lesson the hard way. He said he hopes others will learn from his mistakes and never trust sangomas who demand big sums of money.
