EFF Leader Julius Malema will be sworn in as a member of the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) on Monday morning at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand. Over eighty Parliamentarians will be sworn in as new members of PAP, in the opening ceremony. New members are sworn in following general elections in a number of African States or a rotation within national delegations. The Parliament has over 255 members representing the 55 African Union (AU) Member States that have endorsed the protocol founding it. Thandi Modise, Thokozile Didiza, Julius Malema and Mandlesizwe Mandela are the new MPs from Mzansi that will be joining the Parliament. The five members in each country must include at least one woman and reflect the diversity of political representation in the National Parliament or deliberative organ. PAP will elect a new president and four vice presidents after AU commission president Moussa Faki Mahamat has opened the new session.
