KZN Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube is worried about councillors who have no matric certificates. On Thursday, the MEC said 234 of the 1 846 councillors in the province do not have matric certificates. According the MEC, four of the 234 councillors had never been to school. Dube-Ncube said her department will not act on this because they were elected by the public. However, she said councillors were still expected to be literate and have a clear understand of their duties. “We have councillors who cannot read and write yet they are expected to understand things like the integrated development programme,” said Dube-Ncube. She said her department has no choice but to support the councillors because they were chosen by the people. Inkatha Freedom Party national chairman Blessed Gwala said the IFP encouraged its members to keep pursuing knowledge. But he said he could not take Dube-Ncube seriously because her former president, Jacob Zuma, made it to the highest office in the country with no formal education. He asked why she had never raised concerns about Zuma’s lack of education. KZN DA leader Zwakele Mncwango said the ANC must practise what it preached. He blasted the ruling party for continuing to hire uneducated people. “I don’t understand what the MEC meant when she said nothing can be done because the councillors were elected by the public. That is not true. The councillors were chosen by their parties before the public voted them in.” When department spokesman Lennox Mabaso was asked why Dube-Ncube never raised concerns about Zuma’s level of education, he said the IFP had misunderstood the MEC’s comments. He said although the IFP thought the MEC was criticising the councillors, she was actually supporting them.
