"Stop representing your friends on Date My Family if you are in love with them, it's not cute." This is an advice from Black Twitter. As usual, Mzansi Magic Show Date My Family lights up Black Twitter every Sunday. And this week was no different and Black Twitter continued with its analysis of the show and its characters. Today's episode featured Taylor Steyn who visited three families in search of a suitable candidate. It was in family number 3 that twitter started being suspicious of Sibongiseni, a female friend of a bachelor by the name of Bonga. Black Twitter blames Sibongiseni of being jealous and for ruining Bonga's chances of being chosen Taylor. They said she actually wanted Bonga for herself as she kept on critisising Taylor about everything. Twitter said she was looking out for herself and was desperate to get out of the friend zone. Some even accused her of holding a side chick position which she was "afraid to lose". At the end Bonga was indeed not chosen by Taylor and twitter blames it all on Sibongiseni.
