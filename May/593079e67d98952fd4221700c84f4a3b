THE 54 suspects who allegedly burned 35 trucks in KZN will appear in the Mooi River Magistrates Court today. Traffic came to a standstill on Sunday as traffic cops battled to remove burnt-out trucks on the N3. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the suspects were charged on Sunday with public violence. “They’re due to appear in court today,” she said. “The situation was back to normal yesterday and all lanes were opened, but police were still monitoring the area.” It’s believed trucks were burned by local drivers who were angry because truck companies refused to stop employing foreigners. Protesters also burned trucks last month, demanding that only South Africans be employed. Premier Willies Mchunu instructed relevant government departments to ensure something like this never happens again. Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda, visiting the area on Monday, condemned the drivers. The damage is estimated to be about R300 million. Following the incident, people claiming to be Mooi River residents took to social media to express their anger. They said some of the protesters were not from the area. Andile Mthiyane wrote on Facebook: “People of Mooi River did nothing wrong. “The truck drivers make people from our area look bad.” Nqobile Chamane wrote: “What angers us is the biased reporting. Mooi Plaza is not Mooi River but it’s in Mooi River. The people of Mooi River stay away from such nonsense, even though they’re jobless. “But if they see food scattered around, they’ll use the opportunity to feed themselves and their families.” She was referring to the frantic scavenging and looting of discarded goods and items on the sidelines of the truck drivers’ show of force. The suspects will appear in court tomorrow.
