THE Protea Glen community has blocked roads in a bid to stop a group people from occupying land illegally, on Monday morning. According to the illegal land invaders, they have permission from the land owners to build on that particular plot. On Sunday, it's report that they clashed with the police as they tried to build shacks on the plot. Motorists were advised to use alternative routes, as several roads were affected by the demonstrations.
