The love of clean shoes is the reason Lethabo Komane started a shoe cleaning
business eKasi. The services include shoe wash,
shoe shine, colour touch up and shoe repair. They also offer hats and leather
and suede handbags cleaning services. Komane and his two partners
also do collections and deliveries as well. Kamane started washing
shoesÂ  for his friends and family but before long, a lot of people started
bringing in their shoes as well. This gave him an idea to start a professional
business. Drop Shoe started in June 2016
in Tsenelong Section of Tembisa but now the business is situated in Samora
Machel Street in Hospital View, Tembisa. They are open for business from
Monday to Saturday 9am to 6pm, and can be contacted on 084 468 3711 or on their
Facebook page Drop Shoe.
