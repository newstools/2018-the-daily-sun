The lion who attacked his owner at a private game reserve near
Thabazimbi in Limpopo at the weekend was killed in the incident. Michael Hodge, 72, the owner of Marakele Predator Centre
"bottle-raised" Shamba the lion since birth. Hodge broke his jaw and
sustained injuries to his neck during the attack. Family spokesperson Bernadette Maguire told News24 on Wednesday morning
that Hodge was recovering in hospital, but he was still traumatised after the
incident. "He is very upset about the loss of Shamba and I think he is trying
to put up a brave face, but he is really battling to come to terms [with] what
has happened," Maguire said. Maguire said Hodge was able to walk for the first time since the
incident with the aid of a physiotherapist at Milpark hospital. "The prognosis is looking good, provided that his infection stays
under control. His wounds have been left open in order to ensure that the
infection does not set into his body." She said the family was relieved that Hodge was "okay",
however, they were also traumatised by the loss of Shamba. The family owned Shamba for 10 years. In a short video clip, Hodge is seen walking behind the lion in a den. WATCH VIDEO BELOW: THIS MAY UPSET SOME SENSITIVE VIEWERS, AS THE VIDEO CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT.
