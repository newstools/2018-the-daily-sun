WALKING on the pavement of Michael Street in Nomzamo, Strand, is a challenge for many. This is because cars park on the pavement, forcing pedestrians to walk on the road. “I have lost count of the number of people who have been hit by car mirrors while walking on the road,” said resident Nosiviwe Mtukela. “Motorists shout at pedestrians and ask them if they cannot see that a car is approaching.” Taxi driver Bathandwa Mdolomba said motorists who park their cars on the pavement are inconsiderate. He said: “This road is very busy. Motorists must think before they park.” Pedestrian Lubabalo Ntlosa said: “When we try to raise the issue with the motorists, they often get aggressive and violent. “We do not know where to report these people. “The traffic officers pass this spot but do not fine the drivers.” Area East MMC councillor Anda Ntsodo said it is illegal to park on the pavements. He said: “Violations of the National Road Traffic Act and the city’s traffic by-laws are far too common. “Given our limited resources, we are not able to be everywhere all of the time. The city calls on residents to assist traffic officers by reporting any issues to 021 596 1999. “This will help us direct our enforcement operations.” He appealed to all motorists to respect other road users, especially pedestrians. “The national pedestrian fatality rate is of great concern, which is why it is so important to have safe walking spaces. That is the purpose of the pavements. “Motorists who obstruct these walkways are putting innocent lives at risk,” Ntsodo said.
