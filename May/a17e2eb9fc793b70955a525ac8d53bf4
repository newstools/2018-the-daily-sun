THESE sub-contractors are gatvol! They claim they have not been paid by the main contractor for three months. On Monday they downed tools and vowed they will not go back to work until they are paid. The sub-contractors are installing stormwater drains and supplying building material for construction of roads in Madiba Park housing project in Springs, Ekurhuleni. They claimed that Mologadi A Nape owes them close to R2 million. “We have been sending invoices every month, but nothing is happening,” said one of the men. They claim this is not the first time they’ve complained of not being paid. They say in January they complained to Daily Sun, and after their story was published they received their money. The housing project in Springs has been marred by problems. Initially, the Ekurhuleni Municipality built hundreds of toilets for residents of Everest/Gugulethu squatter camp. The residents were to erect shacks while waiting for the municipality to build them houses. But nearby residents of Payneville and other suburbs took the municipality to court. The court ruled in their favour in 2016, forcing the municipality to destroy the toilet project worth millions. Mologadi A Nape’s project manager Thabo Matseba said they would meet to address the issue. Ekurhuleni municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said the contractor had to explain why it was not paying its sub-contractors.
