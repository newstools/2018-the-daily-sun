ONE’S dreams can easily become reality through hard work. Throughout his childhood, all he wanted was to see himself being featured in one of Mzansi’s television soapies. Meet Mpho Mashabela from Mahwelereng, in Limpopo, who is the man behind Mr Setati’s character in popular SABC1 soapie, Skeem Saam. Mr Setati is one of the customers who give car mechanic, Big Boy Mabitsela, a headache every day. His first appearance will be on 19 July. The actor says he’s happy that his prayers have been answered and he looks forward to bringing more entertainment in the industry. He said he grew up watching and listening to drama series on both television and radio. Mpho, who is a product of Paul Rapetsoa’s acting agency, says playing one of Big Boy Mabitsela’s customers is a gift from God. He told SunBuzz that despite him being a Christian, he would accept every acting opportunity he got. “Acting is normal work like other jobs, and people should not judge actors according to the roles they play on TV,” said Mpho. He said he was delighted to be part of the Skeem Saam crew, as he had always wished. “My character in Skeem Saam betrays the life I used to live several years ago,” he said. He said he would never forget the day he received a call, informing him of the good news that he’d got the role of Mr Setati. “Because I believed in myself during the auditions, the call did not come as a surprise,” said the actor. He added: “Skeem Saam is my first priority now and I appreciate the opportunity. “I do believe that many of our viewers will learn a lot from my part.” Mpho said he never lost hope in his dreams after he got involved in a car accident two years ago, which saw him on wheelchair. “I’m a living testimony that God is able no matter what one is going through,” he said. “I’m happy now that everything is under control because the opportunity I got at Skeem Saam swept all the pain away,” he said.
