IN a village where break-ins are common, gogo Deliwe Nzuza, whose mud house windows and door don’t close properly, puts her faith in her dog Bahlangene Ngaye. The 76-year-old gogo from Phande Village in Obonjeni, northern KZN, told Daily Sun  Bahlangene Ngaye keeps her safe. “Bahlangene Ngaye is my guardian angel,” said the gogo. “He won’t let anyone near my door and windows. “I haven’t been attacked by village thugs, thanks to him.” She said Bahlangene Ngaye doesn’t even want neighbours to come near her house. “When they want to visit me, they shout from several metres away and ask me to tie him under the tree with rope.” She has lived alone for the past 30 years after the death of her only son. “My son died a long time ago, and he didn’t have kids when he died so I don’t even have grandchildren. I’ve never had any close family,” said gogo Deliwe. She said relatives from her mother’s family disowned her when she was still young because she insisted on looking for her father, only to discover that he had died before she even started looking for him. She said she told the late ward councillor, Njabulo Dlamini she needed a better house and he kept saying he had not forgotten. The ward councillor, Sbonelo Mathenjwa of the IFP, said he was aware of gogo’s house. “Right now I am busy working on her matter. I have purchased material for a two-room house from my own pocket and soon enough it will be built and she will be able to live in a safe place,” he said.
