Media personality Minnie Dlamini is currently in Russia to find the coolest Russians to bring back to South Africa to experience the World Cup Mzansi style. The Homeground host announced this on her Instagram recently. “We cooked up something crazy, something wild, because everyone says that the FIFA World Cup in South Africa was the best one yet,” Minnie said in the video. But why would Russians want to experience the World Cup in Mzansi instead of their own backyard? Well, because there is simply no better place to experience the World Cup than in Africa. We are renowned for our hospitality, we have the best fan culture around and we have the Vuvuzela. Who can forget 2010 and the show we put up for the world? 2010 is still so relevant the Russians designed a stadium that looks exactly like the FNB Stadium. The FIFA World Cup kicks off on the 14th of June and draws to a close on the 15th of July 2018. The showpiece is set to take place at 12 different venues in 11 cities in Russia.
