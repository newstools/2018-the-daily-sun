THE parents of kids at Qhayisa Secondary School in Hermanus are gatvol. They want all the teachers who have sexual relationships with pupils to be removed from the school. A teacher is in jail for allegedly raping, kidnapping and pointing a firearm at a pupil. He was arrested last month and will appear in court again on Thursday for a bail application. A pupil (18) told Daily Sun that other teachers also had relationships with young girls. “It’s normal to find teachers at our school dating pupils. I was also approached by a teacher. “He would invite me to his house but I felt uncomfortable and stopped visiting him.” A teacher said: “My pupils would ask me what I was doing when I was silent while they were suffering. “As a mum, it’s painful what these kids are going through.” Councillor Lindile Ntsabo told the People’s Paper: “It’s painful what happened at the school. “The teacher was arrested but not suspended. Why? At a recent meeting, pupils revealed that some girls have become pregnant. I beg the residents to let the law take its course.” Jessica Shelver, a spokeswoman for the Western Cape Education Department, said: “The department is proceeding with formal charges they will serve on the alleged employee once he is released. “We are providing support and counselling for the alleged victim. “Regarding the allegations of inappropriate relationships with pupils, these accusations surfaced on social media and are currently being investigated.”
