A FAMILY of 23 were overjoyed to get a brand new, furnished four-roomed house when mayor Sylvia Nxumalo and human settlements official Bongani Magagula cut the ribbon recently. Blind gogo Kate Msimano (61) lives with her eight kids and late sisters’ 14 kids – eight of whom are partially blind and deaf – in Mkhuhlu, outside Hazyview. The Bushbuckridge mayor said: “Today, we’re handing over this home to a needy family.” Kate said: “We live in a small shack and have no privacy.” The gogo thanked  God for hearing their prayers. Earlier that day in Shatale outside Dwarsloop, Nxumalo donated a netball kit at Nkuna High School. She also handed over title deeds to gogo Lemita Malope (78) and Lilly Malele (59). Nxumalo said the human settlements department would deliver more than 3 700 houses. “We strongly warn residents not to buy building material from corrupt contractors,” she told the People’s Paper. “People must stop being greedy and applying for houses when they already have homes. “Many houses are rented out as spaza shops and some are abandoned for criminals to conduct their activities from.”
