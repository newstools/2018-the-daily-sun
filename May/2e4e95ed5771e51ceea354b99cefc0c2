COMMUNICATIONS Minister
Nomvula Mokonyane destroyed fake DVD's estimated to the value of R106 million. Mokonyane and the Film and
Publication Board, SAPS and the City of Cape Town’s Department of Economic
Development, led the destruction of more than 106 000 illegal pirated DVDs and
CDs. These pirated material was seized
at various raids conducted in Cape Town and Durban in conjunction with the law
enforcement agencies. "The impact of illegal
distribution of DVDs and CDs is a scourge that negatively impacts on the
industry as well as the economy of the country. “Piracy peddlers steal
intellectual property. They steal revenue due to destitute families by
depriving them of royalties. People lose their jobs as more DVD shops close due
to poor business,” Mokonyane said. The Minister said the
destruction is also conducted purely to prevent the confiscated DVDs and CDs from
finding their way back to the illegal market, thus exposing children to
undesirable and age-inappropriate content. The Films and Publications
Act prohibits the distribution of unclassified films and games.
