Property development and investment group Amdec confirmed on
Monday that it had cancelled a lease with Trillian for office space at Melrose
Arch. The property group sighted the potential for “reputation damage” as the reason. Trillian is still reeling from scandals related to the
governance of Eskom in recent years under former CEO Brian Molefe, former CFO
Anoj Singh and, more broadly, former minister of public enterprises Lynne
Brown. Trillian is in the process of contesting an Eskom bid to
recover R600m it was paid by the power utility under its past leadership. The state-owned
power provider also paid R1bn to McKinsey, who have indicated a willingness to
repay the money. Amdec managing director Mike Vermaak told Fin24 that
Trillian’s lease with them at Melrose Arch was, indeed cancelled, with a year
left. He said the cancellation was considered final and that Amdec
had nothing else to say on the matter other than what has been reported and
announced. “I think what we said was made by the CEO. That is the only
statement we have to release. We don’t want to carry on with the subject. It
has been reported and announced extensively and we do not have any further
comments to make in this regard,” Vermaak said. On Monday morning Business Day reported that Amdec would
cancel Trillian's lease for office space at Melrose Arch with a year left on
the agreement. SOURCE: NEWS24
