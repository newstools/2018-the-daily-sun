THE African National Congress (ANC) regions in
KwaZulu-Natal will hold four elective conferences this weekend. Emalahleni, Far
North, Musa Dladla and Inkosi Bhambatha regions have successfully convened
their branch general meetings (BGMs) and they meet the 70 percent threshold
required to convene their regional conferences and elect new regional
leadership. Provincial Task
Team coordinator Sihle Zikalala said the processes leading up to the elective
conferences went smoothly and "we are confident that the conferences will
also proceed as planned and will be characterised by frank and robust debates". The conferences will not only elect new leadership but
will also focus on crafting an implementation plan for the 54th National
Conference resolutions. “ANC conferences are not only about electing leaders but
focus more on policies. We have a big task as ANC members to ensure that all
resolutions of the 54th National Conference are implemented with speed.
Therefore, it is imperative for ANC members to engage properly,” said  Zikalala. He added that the
conference would also focus on unity and cohesion. “We are satisfied
with the work done by the task teams deployed in Emalahleni and the Far North
Regions. These regions had encountered challenges which resulted in the
provincial task teams deployed to assist them. The PEC disbanded Emalahleni
Region in 2016 as it was beset by divisions which made comrades unable to deal
with the work of the organisation. Now, we are very happy about unity in the
region hence the convening of the conference. In Far North, certain powers were
withdrawn by the PEC due to disunity. We also sent the task team comprising
highly experienced members to run the affairs of that region. The work that has
been done in these two regions brings much confidence to the ANC members of the
communities within the jurisdiction of these regions,” said Zikalala.
