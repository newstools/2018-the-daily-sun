RUMOURS and gossip are big problems in kasis across SunLand and many have come to blows because of it. But a pastor in block SS in Soshanguve, Tshwane, has fallen victim to a different kind of chatter. Lina Motsene said voices of people shouting terrible insults about her drift in from outside her room at midnight. But when she and her husband rush outside to see who the people are, they find no one outside. The 43-year-old pastor said she and her husband Oupa (56) have had sleepless nights since this started last year. She told Daily Sun the voices of men and women insulting her start exactly at midnight. She said the mean voices call out: “You abort children and don’t qualify to be a preacher.” “We thought the voices were at our old home where we had a church. So we moved but they followed us,” she said. Kasi people now call her horrible, unprintable names. Oupa said whoever has issues with them must confront them. “They should say all those things to our faces, not from outside at midnight,” he said. Prophet Seiletje Mangena said Lina was being tested. “All these evil spirits are testing her faith, and no matter where she relocates they will always follow her,” he said. He said Lina needed a strong pastor to pray for her. “Just one prayer from a genuine priest can chase away the evil,” he said.
