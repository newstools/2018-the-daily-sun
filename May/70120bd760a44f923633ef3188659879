THE HAWKS arrested a 43-year-old man with more than
R1.5 million worth of drugs. Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said the suspect remains
in police custody, this after he made a brief appearance at Klerksdorp
Magistrate Court. "Frank Nwaru was arrested by the Hawksâ€™ South
African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB) after they operated on information
of alleged drug dealing near a primary school in the area," Rikhotso
said. He was spotted leaving his apartment and when he
noticed that he was being followed, he allegedly threw a black plastic bag
inside his vehicle and attempted to run away. Rikhotso said the suspect was immediately overpowered
and detained whilst his vehicle was searched, the cops found drugs in the black
plastic bag. He mentioned that the cops took the suspect back to
the apartment and a thorough search uncovered a neatly packed crystal meth and
CAT drugs worth approximately R1.5 million. Nwaru's case was postponed to 29 May, for a formal
bail application. North West Hawks Provincial Head Major General Linda
Mbana praised the cops. "Drugs affect our communities negatively and
that is why we will continue to dedicate our efforts into fighting the scourge
of drugs and arrest the perpetrators."
