AFTER struggling to find jobs, the two women started their own business in Khayelitsha in Mangaung, Free State. Dieketseng Moeti (28) and Ntswaki Sekeleoane (36) are now known ekasi for their delicious braaied chicken feet and heads. They started the business earlier last year and people love their spicy meat. “We started our business last year after we got tired of sitting at home, doing nothing. “My husband and I were not working and we had kids to support,” said Dieketseng. “I took the money my husband made doing piece jobs and combined it with my neighbour Ntswaki’s to do our own thing. “People buy from us because our prices are low. We only charge R1 per foot or head. “We sell from 7am until late. We don’t rest because people place many orders. “We smear the chicken in our secret sauce, which people love.” Ntswaki is lucky to have a neighbour like Dieketseng. “She came up with this idea and I didn’t let her down. I started working immediately,” she said. “I haven’t gone to bed on an empty stomach since we started. I can put food on the table for my family. “We never cheat each other and we share all the money equally. “Business is good and we want to start selling meat and Russians in the future. “My mum taught me never to depend on a man. Women must open businesses.”
