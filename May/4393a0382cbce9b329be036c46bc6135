ISHMAEL Msiza (47) from Reiger Park, Ekurhuleni, was a truck driver until he lost his job in June last year and his world came crashing down. “I felt sorry for myself and lost all hope,” he said. “I stayed at home and started fighting with my partner, which led to our separation. “To add salt to the wound, my car broke down and hasn’t worked ever since. I thought I had nothing to live for.” His mum, a loyal Daily Sun reader, gave him copies to read about other people’s problems. “I was inspired by the articles and realised other people had bigger and more serious problems than what I was going through,” said Ishmael. “They went on with their lives, despite the many tragedies.” That’s when he started a garden outside his yard and named it Daily Sun. “It became my source of hope. Daily Sun saved my life. That’s why I’ve made this garden and named it after the paper,” he said. “The stories gave me hope to look forward to another day. I’ve been through a lot and did this as a token of appreciation.” Ishmael is still searching for a job in the trucking industry. Kids play in his small garden and that makes him feel good. “I’ve built planes, trains, a stadium and things that entertain kids,” he said. “It’s all thanks to Daily Sun. I read the paper every day.”
