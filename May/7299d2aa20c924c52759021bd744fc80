THE Social Justice Coalition occupied space outside the City of Cape Town’s office on Wednesday and picketed against evictions. About 50 members and people from Cape Town kasis said the city has not delivered houses but destroyed their shacks. Picketers camped out on mattresses at the entrance to the civic centre for three hours. Makhaza residents said their shacks were destroyed and when the rain came, they didn’t have anywhere to shelter. Coalition general secretary Axolile Notywala said their protest followed an 11 April court application against the city’s evictions by 217 occupiers from Khayelitsha. He said the city evicted backyarders from Island squatter camp in Makhaza and there were more evictions in the area between March and April. “Where should these people go? Everywhere they go, they are chased away They are denied their dignity and government refuses to listen to them. “They no longer have homes, but also have no way to hold the city responsible and regain the homes they have lost.” Nobuhle Mtengwana from Khayelitsha said: “We have suffered enough at the hands of the city. They don’t care what happens to us. All they do is remove us from vacant land, when we have nowhere to go. “We are evicted from land the city doesn’t use at all.” Councillor Xanthea Limberg said the city got an eviction order in September to remove unoccupied structures. “In March, there were invasions and the city’s anti-invasion unit removed unoccupied and partially built structures. “We had an interdict to allow us to remove unoccupied structures,” she said.
