JOSEPH Raphasha thought having two wives would make him happy. For years, the 90-year-old had one wife where he worked in Joburg and one back home in Venda. But his dream of a big, happy family ended when he went home to retire in 2006. His two wives didn’t get on and six years ago, the second wife Doreen (57), cut off electricity to the house Joseph and his first wife Sara (70) share. The house was being supplied from the electricity box in Doreen’s yard. Madala Joseph said when he and Sara moved back to Ha-Matsa Village in Nzhelele, Limpopo, from Joburg, he built a house for them next door to where Doreen and her four kids were living. He said when things got bitter, he approached Eskom to ask for an electricity box to be installed in his and Sara’s yard. It was put in but it soon stopped working. “Technicians later came and told me the box had been illegally connected. They disconnected it and fined me R2 000,” he said. Doreen told the SunTeam after she refused to share her box with Joseph, he went to Eskom and had it disconnected. “I’m living with my disabled daughter and now we are forced to use candles,” she said. However, Joseph said Doreen caused all the problems and brought the situation on herself. Eskom spokesman Dikgabne Rampedi said the owner of the box was Joseph and he had asked for it to be disconnected. “We can’t reconnect Doreen’s electric box because it’s a family matter which must be resolved first,” said Rampedi.
