FOR years pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng and prophet Shepherd Bushiri didn’t get along. But the two have decided to make peace. Mboro, of Incredible Happenings Ministries and Bushiri, of the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church, have said they would team up to unite all Christian leaders. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mboro said they were brought together by the word of God. “As church leaders, we should walk in reconciliation and forgiveness,” he said. “We should not be acting like rivals. The battle should end because it’s confusing the body of Christ. The bad mouthing among church leaders must come to an end.” He said those who were out to create bad blood between them created a fake Mboro Facebook account. “They posted that I had gone to heaven, met Jesus and was selling selfies,” he said. “This was meant to tarnish my name and it got out of hand.” At the time the fake Facebook account went viral and CRL Rights Commission chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva accused Mboro of trying to cheat people out of their money. Mboro said he and Bushiri had sorted out all their issues. “We sat down and talked about them.”
