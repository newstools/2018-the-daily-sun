WELL known blesser with a good cause, Malcolm X,
brought an early Christmas for a Zimbabwean man living in Mzansi. He found Tonde Tsvangirai
in the shop and asked him to buy anything he wants. At first Tonde went for two pieces of chicken but Malcom
X told him to get serious and buy anything that he wanted. He then started picking a lot items, enough to fill the
trolley. At the cashier he was given cash to pay for everything
after which Malcolm X told him to tell the cashier to keep change. Malcolm X is well known for surprising people with cash.
