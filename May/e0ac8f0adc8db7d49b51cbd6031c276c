WHEN parents at Zamokuhle Primary School in D section KwaMashu, north of Durban, came home from a parents’ meeting on Sunday, they were fuming. Early the next day, they were back at the school, still angry. They locked the gates and demanded that a teacher who allegedly attacked pupils with a coat hanger be fired. They threatened to shut down the school. They told Daily Sun they first heard about the allegations during the parents’ meeting on Sunday. Parent Jully Machi (40) said four parents reported the teacher, who apparently apologised, to the principal. She said they found out at the parents’ meeting she hadn’t stopped moering kids. More parents complained about her beating their children. Another parent, Thandiwe Ndaba (37), said: “There’s a lot going on at the school. At the meeting we found out two teachers had fought in front of pupils. “Apparently, one of the teachers demanded that pupils pick up litter while the other teachers were teaching.” She said a grade 7 teacher had asked kids to start a stokvel in February to raise funds for a farewell dance. “The teacher asked the pupils to pay R10 a month. The teacher should’ve talked to us,” she said. Another parent, Samkelo Shelembe (35), said if the teacher who beat the kids was not fired, they would shut down the school. The SGB’s Thoko Hlatshwayo said the teacher will report to the circuit office until the matter’s been resolved. Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said: “Parents should allow the department to investigate. They shouldn’t disturb teaching and learning.”
