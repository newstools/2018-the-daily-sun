MAMELODI Sundowns are already planning for life without the departing Khama Billiat. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has confirmed the signing of Toni Silva, who will be leaving Greek side, Levadiakos, next month to replace Billiat. Mosimane described the Guinea-Bissau player as versatile, capable of playing on the wing and in central midfield. “He has played for Benfica, Liverpool and Chelsea’s youth sides,” said Mosimane. “He’s friends with Raheem Sterling from their days in the youth team. But he hasn’t reached his full potential yet. We have to work on him. “Cape Town City wanted him but he chose to sign with us. We are losing Khama.” But the focus for Mosimane is on Wydad Casablanca, the Morocco side Sundowns face in the opening match of the Caf Champions League group phase at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (9pm). “Like Esperance, Wydad are a very tough side. Our matches with them are always tight with very tight scores. Whoever scores first often goes on to win the match,” Mosimane said. “They have changed coaches and haven’t lost a match in 14 outings. They are second in their league. “Coach Faouzi Benzarti is a legend. He is the Hassan Shehata of Champions League football. “The good thing is that he likes an open game, he attacks.” Without suspended Percy Tau in attack, the Brazilians lineup will have a different look to it. But Mosimane is not having any sleepless nights with a fully fit Billiat available. He said: “Khama is coming in to replace Percy in the No 9 position, a position from which he scored many goals a season ago. “Bangaly (Soumahoro) is back too. But he needs two or so games to catch up. We’ve been winning away in the Champions League. Hopefully we continue that way.” Mosimane has four more spots open to register players for Caf, having had two spots vacated due to the departure of Siyanda Zwane and Fares Hachi. With the Absa Premiership title wrapped up, the Tshwane giants will be eager to progress past the Caf group stages.
