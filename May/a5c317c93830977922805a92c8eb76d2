Safety and Security mayoral committee member Councillor Jean-Pierre Smith has blamed sinister forces for violent protests rocking the Western Cape. Smith said cops recorded 145 protests since January. He blamed some of them on the Ses’khona People’s Rights Movement. The radical group made headlines in 2013 when its leader Andile Lili, along with eight other members, dumped kak at Cape Town International Airport. “I’m being discreet about my second guess,” said Smith. “We’ve seen CCTV footage and we held meetings with the residents. “On the CCTV, people can be seen transporting tyres to the Bo-Kaap. These are gangsters.” Lili said: “JP’s talking nonsense.” He said the City must start listening to its poor residents. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said: “Public order police members are on high alert.”
