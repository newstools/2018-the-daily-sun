Supersport analyst and former Springbok wing Ashwin Willemse, left many stunned on Saturday when he walked off set during a live post match analysis. Willemse was unhappy with the treatment from his fellow analysts former springboks Nick Mallet and Nass Botha. “I have played this game for a long time like most of us here, as a player i was labelled a quota player for a long time, I’ve worked hard to earn my own respect in this game. “So I’m not gonna be patronized by two individuals who played in an apartheid, segregated era,” Willemse said before putting his papers on the table and walking off set. The 36 year old also stated that he felt undermined by Mallet and Botha who appeared to be laughing at him. Willemse’s actions divided opinion on Twitter with some feeling he conducted himself unprofessionally while others felt he had to stand up for himself in the manner he did.
