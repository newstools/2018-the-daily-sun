CLEANERS at Ntyatyambo Primary in Zwide, Port Elizabeth, got the shock of their lives on Thursday. They discovered guns stashed inside toilets! The evil thugs who put them there had probably thought no one would find them. Police spokesman Andre Beetge told Daily Sun the cleaners alerted the police, who rushed to the school. “Four firearms including two pistols and two shotguns, as well as 150 live rounds of ammunition, were found. “They were in several bags in the toilets, which are now used to store rubbish at the school.” Beetge said the firearms had been sent to forensic and ballistic expects to check if they were used to commit crimes. “One of the shotguns was stolen in 2017 in Worcester.” Motherwell cluster commander Major General Dawie Rabie said: “The firearms are now off the street and out of the hands of criminals. “Our community can rest assured that their environment is now safer and police are expecting to make arrests soon.”
