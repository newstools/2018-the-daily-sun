After a lot of hype was created around the May 25th release of Touch My Blood, but fans will have to wait a little while longer.

AKA apologized to his fans for the delay, saying that he and his team want everything to be perfect. He also asked the Megacy to be patient with him. “I tried my best to make it to the 25th but we need more time to shoot videos, release singles, drop merchandise, confirm dates for the tour etc. Sorry,” he tweeted.
