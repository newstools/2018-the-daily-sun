“GAUTENG Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi can post about the launch of this school on social media, but he won’t see it as long as we are not paid.” These were the words of Michael Nkwana, who said he has not been paid for work he has been doing at Julius Sebolai Primary School in Braamfischerville, Soweto. Michael was sub-contracted to do bricklaying at the school in 2016. “I have become an enemy to my workers as they think I used their money, but it was never paid to me. They think I betrayed them,” he said. Michael Sithole, another contractor working at the school, said his company’s permit had expired but he could not afford to re-register. “I am owed a total of R50 000. I have to go to the site every day to stop the workers from finishing the job,” he said. Business partners Norman Kubjana (50) and David Kutane (52) said they were owed R100 000. “We used our own money to buy building materials, because we thought we would be reimbursed. Now they are sending us from pillar to post,” said Norman, “We need to make money. We have families to support. Hanging around the school is a waste of time and money. We kept our end of the deal, now they must keep theirs.” Gauteng infrastructure development spokesman Theo Nkonki said: “The department is aware of the matter. “It is important to clarify that the stoppage is a matter between the main contractor and sub-contractors. “The retention fee is normally paid after the department establishes that work has been done in accordance with the contract. “We received an invoice yesterday from the main contractor for some of the completed work. The invoiced amount will be paid to the main contractor within 30 days.”
