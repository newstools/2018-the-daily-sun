HELP cops find these two men, wanted for hijacking. This follows a request for assistance to community members to
help cops find the two men. In a statement Johannesburg central Spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele said on the 25th of January 2018
at around 13:00, a 27-year old male parked a white Isuzu Bakkie company vehicle
at corner John and Pop Street. “Two males approached him one pointed him with a firearm and
they forced him to drive off. At Booysens he was forced inside a white Quantum and he was
dropped off at Zuurbekom,” he said. Mbele described the suspects as one of them is short in height, body weight medium, and
allegedly between the ages 30-35 and he spoke Sotho language. The other suspect is tall in height, weight fit with
traditional marks in both cheeks and is also alleged to be between 35-40 years
of age. “Police are appealing to the community; anyone with
information of the whereabouts of the suspects appearing in these photos to
contact Johannesburg Central Cluster Detectives Officer Constable Khoza on this
number 078-836-7594,” said Mbele.
