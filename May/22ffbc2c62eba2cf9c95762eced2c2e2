AMAJITA coach Thabo Senong has named his final squad for the first leg of an U-20 AFCON qualifier with Mozambique on Saturday. The game is scheduled for 3pm at Campo de Ferroviaro da Beira. Senong has trimmed his unit from 27 players to 20 following a training camp in Johannesburg. Missing out on the trip to Mozambique are goalkeeper Giovanni Idi (University of Pretoria); defenders Gcina Mlotshwa (Bloemfontein Celtic), Thabo Mokoena (Kaizer Chiefs) and Saluleko Mathonsi (Wits University); midfielder Roberto Fragale (Highlands Park) and strikers, Tristan Nikitaridis (University of Johannesburg) as well as Jermaine George (Old Mutual Academy). Amajita return to South Africa on Sunday, 13 May and are expected to move their base camp to Rustenburg the next day (Monday, 14 May) for the second leg, which is scheduled for Sunday, 20 May at Moruleng Stadium at 3pm.
