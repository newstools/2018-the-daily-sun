WHEN Katlego Makhubela saw a friend and her neighbour fighting, she tried to save the day by breaking them up. But instead of being thanked for making peace, she was moered for her efforts! The 21-year-old from Hammanskraal, in Tshwane, walked away bleeding and bruised after the fight on Monday. She said the trouble started while she and her friend were walking to the friend’s house. The friend’s neighbour stormed out of her house and confronted them. Katlego said the neighbour complained that her friend had used her washing line. The two got into a heated argument and that is when Katlego stepped in. She said she thought everything had been resolved, but the neighbour’s husband barged into the friend’s house a few hours later. Katlego said he told her he was getting revenge for his wife. “I explained to him that he had no right to barge into someone’s home and threaten them,” she said. Katlego told Daily Sun the man grabbed her, threw her to the floor and started kicking her. She said when she tried to get up, he picked up a brick and threw it at her. She was taken to hospital with a head injury. She opened a case. Constable Herman Moremi of Temba Police Station confirmed a case of assault was opened. The SunTeam phoned the neighbours numerous times for comment but they did not pick up.
