Media personality and radio legend, Tbo Touch has allegedly been slapped with a R1.3 million lawsuit by a Johannesburg-based production and marketing company. According to the Sunday World, the company, called JB Media, is accusing Touch of failing to pay for services rendered to him and his companies. The publication claims to be in possession of court documents that show that “JB Media signed multiple media contracts with Touch Central Marketing and Media House to provide ongoing production and marketing services to it and its affiliated ventures”. The company provided outdoor advertising for Touch’s companies between April and September 2017 and have reportedly been in touch with the radio mogul who he has failed to pay up. They now want Tbo Touch, real name Thabo Molefe, to pay all the money owed to them, including interest and the costs of the lawsuit.
