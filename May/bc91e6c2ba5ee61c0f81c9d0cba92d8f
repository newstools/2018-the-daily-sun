MASKANDI artist Mthandeni “Igcokama Elisha” Manqele was allegedly chased away from the home of the late maskandi singer Mjikijelwa “Ichalaha” Ngubane in Maphumulo, KZN on Saturday. Mthandeni had allegedly gone there to pay his last respects to Mjikijelwa’s family after his death on Friday morning. But the Ngubane family chased him away when he arrived. Mthandeni and Mjikijelwa had worked together with Ali Mgube in their maskandi group, called Ondabuzekwayo. They had released three albums. A source told Daily Sun that Mthandeni was chased away by Mjikijelwa’s family because they accused him of making fun of his illness on his latest album, Ithuna Ledixa. “On the album there is a song where Mthandeni says there is a zombie who is critically ill. “He released that song around the time when Mjikijelwa was in and out of hospital,” said the source. Mjikijelwa’s sister, Thembi Ngubane, who is also his manager, confirmed that they did not welcome Mthandeni. She said the reason was that they wanted to mourn alone as a family. “Mthandeni has our cellphone numbers. He cannot just come to our home without phoning first. “If he had phoned first, we would have told him not to come because at the moment we are in shock and wish to mourn alone as family,” said Thembi. “This is our time of mourning for our brother, not for him to shine.” Mthandeni said: “I went there and everything went well. I hear people are saying my song lyrics were referring to Mjikijelwa’s illness. “That song was meant for Khuzani, who is my rival. Mjikijelwa was older than me. I will attend his funeral,” he said. Meanwhile, Thembi said four memorial services will be held to honour Mjikijelwa on Thursday. “One will be held in Durban and another in KwaMaphumulo, while the two others will be held at Dube Hostel in Soweto and also in downtown Joburg.”
