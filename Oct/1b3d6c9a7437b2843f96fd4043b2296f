KATLEHONG police will hold a prayer session tomorrow following the discovery of a woman’s body on Monday. Police spokesman Mega Ndobe said cops will pray for God’s help in the fight against gender-based violence and child abuse. Ndobe said the woman sustained injuries to her lower body. No one has come forward to identify the victim and no one fitting her description was reported missing. Police have opened murder and rape cases. “The body was taken to the Germiston mortuary for forensic investigation,” said Ndobe. The officer who responded to the complaint said the body was burned beyond recognition. The victim has not yet been identified. Randfontein cops have urged anyone with information to contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
