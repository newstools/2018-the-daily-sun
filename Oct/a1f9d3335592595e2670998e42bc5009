A FIGHT over their house in Atteridgeville, Tshwane has torn the Mashabas apart. Virginia Marima (67) said her sister, Sophie Dhlamini (54), and brother Magwetja Mashaba (43) told her to leave the house in 2016 after she had lived there for 60 years. Virginia said she went to live with her relative Naomi Makwakwa (65), not far away. The family told the SunTeam the trouble started when Sophie divorced her husband in 2015 and moved back into the family home. Family member Maxwell Magwetja (48) said his uncle, Thabang Magwetja (62), who was in prison for shooting relatives, was also chased away. He said Sophie left Thabang with nowhere to sleep. Relative Happy Makwakwa (60) said they needed help from social workers and pastors. Sophie denied abusing her siblings. Sophie’s ex-husband Simon Dhlamini (58), who has since moved back into the house, said Naomi was the one causing trouble. Magwetja said: “I don’t speak to Naomi. “ She is a liar. I never chased people away.”
