The Jeppe Street provincial clinic will be closing down. This after the R3 Million spent on refurbishing the clinic, did
nothing to improve the health of the employees and patients. The shocking revelation was made by Gauteng Health MEC Gwen
Ramokgopa. Ramokgopa was responding to questions sent to her by the Democratic
Alliance’s shadow Health MEC, Jack Bloom. The staff is said to be relocated to the 18th Avenue clinic
in Alexandra, Joburg. Patients will be transferred to the Esselen clinic and the
Hillbrow Community Health Centre.” Bloom said that according to Ramokgopa, management decided
to close the clinic because infrastructure issues have resurfaced. “This poses a health risk to staff and patients,’’ she said. The clinic was closed in 2012 when it was renovated for R2
million. The renovations were completed in 2014, and it was closed
again in March last year and reopened in November of that year. Bloom has called for a forensic investigation to be launched
into the refurbishment of the clinic. “I am dismayed that so much money was wasted on contractors
hired by the Infrastructure Development Department who were unable to do a good
job to fix this clinic,” Bloom said.
