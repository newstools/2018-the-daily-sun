THE pastor promised him the job of painting his house but when he arrived, he had the most traumatic experience of his life. The 37-year-old man from Tshepisong near Kagiso, Mogale City told Daily Sun the pastor overpowered him, handcuffed him and raped him. The 37-year-old man said the unmarried pastor insisted that he sleep over at his house so he could start work early in the morning. “That night, he sneaked into the bedroom where I was sleeping and handcuffed me. When I asked him what he was doing, he gagged me so I couldn’t scream,” he said. The man said he opened a case at Kagiso Police Station but it wasn’t going anywhere. “The cops have failed me because the pastor is roaming freely,” he said. The man said the police didn’t take his case seriously. “Some laughed at me, saying I was crazy.” Police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya advised the man to explain to the station commander what had happened to him and to check the status of his case.
