M pho Mofokeng believes it’s her time to shine. The 20-year-old from Ekurhuleni is one of the new Craz-e   presenters. Mpho told SunBuzz she was grateful to be a part of the e.tv youth show. She said it felt amazing and the opportunity came at the right time. Mpho recalled the day when she found out about the auditions. “I was lying on the floor at home, without a care in the world. “I saw the advert and told my mum I’d go for auditions. “I even told her I had a strong feeling I’d get the part.” She said she’d always wanted to be in the entertainment industry. “Growing up, I used to pretend I was a TV presenter. “I’d entertain my family and they enjoyed every moment of it. “I always knew I had it in me. That’s why I gave it my all when I auditioned for Craz-e.” Mpho said she wanted to be in the industry for keeps. “I hope this opportunity will take me far. “The aim is to enjoy myself on the show despite my eyesight problem. “I have to work 10 times harder because I’ve got to memorise the script and know it word for word.” Mpho said she was happy with her career so far. “I’m living my passion and I’m going to use this platform to lead by example and show young people who are dreamers that it’s possible if you work hard.”
