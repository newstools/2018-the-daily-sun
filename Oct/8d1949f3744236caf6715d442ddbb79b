GRADE 12 pupils who where were feeling good about Tuesday’s “easy peasy” English exam were brought down to earth by yesterday’s difficult accounting paper. But they remained positive. Daily Sun spoke to Mzansi matric students who wrote the accounting paper. “I knew it was going to be hard and I studied through the night and only slept for four hours. I think that the questions I answered will give me good marks.” Matshidiso Malebogo (17) from Heatherdale High School said it was okay even though she didn’t get to finish. Syravith Eilers (17) also had the same problem. “I didn’t finish because I didn’t expect a lot of reading in question 4, but I’m confident that I passed” Tshegofatso Rapuleng (18) from Petunia Secondary School said: “The paper proved to be a battle. I struggled with question two which was about VAT, which we didn’t expect but it was better than the trial exam.” Some pupils are writing tourism today.
