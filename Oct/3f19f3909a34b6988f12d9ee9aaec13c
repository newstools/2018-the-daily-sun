The second installment of Afropunk Joburg is fast approaching and the anticipation is building. Returning to Constitution Hill on 30 and 31 December 2018, the annual festival is a celebration of self-expression through the arts, music, and fashion featuring a line-up of live performances by black artists. After a successful South African launch event in 2017, the festival returns this year to provide a unique mesh of a good party and a safe space for everyone. In addition to the line-up of renowned musicians scheduled to perform at the festival, Afropunk is also calling on undiscovered or up and coming acts to enter the Battle of the Bands competition. The festival is calling the competition “the first expression of mentorship, support and encouragement in our creative community”. Battle of the Bands calls for new artists to submit their work and stand a chance to perform at the festival. Musicians are asked to submit their work by entering their SoundCloud username on the Afropunk website and then select a track to submit and verify that your profile details are correct. Afropunk supporters will then have the opportunity to vote for eight of their favourtie singers, bands or DJs. The top eight will them perform live at the finals of the Battle of the Bands competition from which a panel of judges will select two winners to perform at the main Afropunk Festival in December. The eight finalists will receive a two-day workshop and mentoring to equip them with everything a new artist needs to know. The Afropunk Festival made its debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2005, and has since expanded to other parts of the world including Paris, London and Joburg.
