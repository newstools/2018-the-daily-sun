Mzwakhe Ncube (37) grabbed her and slit her throat, before
fleeing the scene on foot. Ncube is said to have convinced Ntombizethu Cele (29), from
the Ngonyameni area that he was a traditional healer in 2015. He allegedly told her that she needed cleansing, as there
were people who were planning to attack her. “Cele believed him and they decided to meet in the Engonyameni area
on 8 April 2015. On the said date the two proceeded to a bush where the accused
was going to perform the cleansing. On arrival the accused turned against the deceased,” police
spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said. A case of murder was reported at the Bhekithemba police
station for investigation after that. Zwane added that following a tough police investigation and
the accused was traced to the Esidwebi area where he was hiding. He was arrested, charged and remained in custody until he
was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder by the Durban High
Court.
