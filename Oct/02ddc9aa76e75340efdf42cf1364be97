THE Dubes have gone into hiding after their loved ones were brutally murdered. The suspect is still at large and they fear for their lives. The family from Magwaveni in Tongaat were woken on Sunday by the suspect, who demanded to speak to his girlfriend Nombuso (33). Soon afterwards, they heard the two arguing, followed by the sound of gunfire. Nombuso’s mum Thokozile (70), who rushed outside to intervene, was shot at as well. The suspect then fled. Nombuso’s sister Nonhlahla (35) said the suspect was angry and asked Nombuso if she still loved him. “When she told him she didn’t know, he shot her. “My sister had been living with him but decided to move in with me three weeks ago. “This was after they fought about her speaking to her colleagues, who were men. She was their manager. “He was a very abusive and jealous man. “But we never thought he would end her life.” Nonhlanhla said her mum was shot while begging the suspect not to shoot Nombuso. “My daughter (14) and I were lucky because, after he had shot my mother and Nombuso, he didn’t come inside but fled.” She said her daughter can’t sleep since the incident. “I’ve decided to leave my house. “I’m afraid he might come back and kill my two kids and me,” she said. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the motive for the deadly attack was unknown. “Tongaat police are investigating two counts of murder.”
