BOYSIE Ncayiyana’s only wish is to get a proper house for his family. The 39-year-old from Matikwe, north of Durban said his one-roomed shack was no longer strong enough. He had to rebuild it after it was swept away by heavy rain in October last year. He said he’s grateful his family escaped unharmed when the incident happened. He told Daily Sun that after his shack was swept away, he went to the councillor’s office to seek help, but was allegedly chased away. “I didn’t understand why he chased me away because I’ve lived in the area since 2014,” Boysie said. He said he and his family slept in their neighbour’s house for four days after his shack was destroyed. “When I realised that I wasn’t going to be helped, I had to rebuild my shack,” he said. But it doesn’t have windows and he used a tent for a roof. “I’m unemployed and can’t afford to build a house for my family. “I desperately need an RDP house. I’m pleading with the People’s Paper to help me contact the councillor. “Maybe he will see the need to help me,” he said. Boysie said he hoped other people would also help him get a house. Councillor Wiseman Nyaba said he couldn’t remember chasing Boysie away. “He should come to my office during the week so we can talk about this matter. Maybe he was told he didn’t belong in my ward because of the demarcation. “But but I don’t remember chasing anyone away,” said Nyaba.
