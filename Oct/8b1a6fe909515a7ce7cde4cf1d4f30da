A 27-year-old man has been arrested after he doused his girlfriend
with petrol in Mokopane in Limpopo. The man doused his 31-year-old girlfriend with petrol and
set her on fire at a flat on the 26th of October,
in the early morning. Police spokesperson Captain Xoli Mbele said the suspect had
an argument with the girlfriend and poured her with petrol while sleeping on
the bed. â€œVictim was taken to hospital by an ambulance where she
later died, on the 28th of October. Her flat was also burnt and fire fighters extinguished the
fire," Mbele said. Suspect was on the run until he was arrested in
Johannesburg, the police say an investigation is under way. The man will be
appearing in the Johannesburg Magistrate Court. "We would like to thank community members for being our
eyes and ears in the fight against crime. Working together between the police and the community yields
positive results," Mbele said.
