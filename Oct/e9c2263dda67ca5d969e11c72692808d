MMABANA Arts Centre in Mahikeng, North West is where it all started for HHP. CEO of Mmabana, Dr Otsile Ntswane, said Jabba Man, as he was popularly known, did not leave a void. He said HHP found a gap and closed it. “No one can ever replace him. He came with his own style and left others to come up with their own. “All we need to do now is create programmes where we can enjoy his music and celebrate him. Let’s expand the Motswako journey,” he said. HHP died on Wednesday. “When a person is disturbed, we should not be judgmental. But we should ask hard questions. All I can say is that he came up with songs to celebrate others, while he himself was facing his own demise. He misled us as we believed with his latest offering he was back.” Ntswane said he had made peace with Jabba’s death, but wanted the youth to learn from his life.
