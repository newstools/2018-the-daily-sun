Local singer, Kelly Khumalo has reached out to Lerato Sengadi in her time of need. Today happens to be Lerato’s 36th birthday and she is celebrating it without her man HHP, who passed away last week. “I know your heart and I also know your Strength. Rise Mbokode Rise @leratolicious1 Happy Birthday Scorpion Queen,” she said in a post on Instagram. Just yesterday, Lerato gave a moving tribute at her late husband’s memorial service in Johannesburg. She followed that up by sharing the complete tribute on her Instagram page to which Kelly responded with words of encouragement. “A woman holds the sharp end of the knife. Stay strong, you are not alone,” Kelly said to Lerato. Kelly was, of course, reaching out to Lerato as a woman who has had to bare the heavy load of losing the love of her life. Kelly’s former lover, Senzo Meyiwa died almost exactly four years prior to the death of HHP. It was around this time, in October 2014 that Kelly’s life was turned upside down. What’s more, Kelly can relate to the trouble that Lerato is experiencing with HHP’s family who are reportedly denying that she and HHP were ever married. Kelly has been in a four-year battle with not only Senzo’s family but even members of the public who have accused her of withholding vital information in the murder of her former lover. I know your heart And I also know your Strength. Rise Mbokode Rise♥? @leratolicious1 Happy Birthday Scorpion ?? Queen ?? #wcw A post shared by  Kelly Khumalo (@kellykhumaloza) on Oct 31, 2018 at 12:55am PDT
