THE community of Vrededorp in Joburg claims the local cemetery has been turned into a drug lab. On Thursday, residents protested at Brixton Cemetery. “They don’t respect the dead. They cook their drugs in the cemetery, and their products are destroying our kids,” said resident Jillinda Brophy. “This is unacceptable. We’re not going to sit and watch our kids die.” Collen Gamsu said the young addicts in his community are uncontrollable. “The elderly live in fear because their grandkids demand money from them when they’re high. It’s time for us to take a tough stance against these druglords.” Police spokeswoman Constable Phumi Kraai said she would find out whether any complaints were lodged at Brixton Police Station. Vrededorp is one of many communities that is standing up to criminals. Two weeks ago, the community of Westbury protested after resident Heather Petersen was killed. Heather had accompanied her 10-year-old niece to school when she was caught in the crossfire of a drug war. Heather was killed, while her niece was slightly wounded in the leg. Three suspects were arrested.
