JEROME Sibulela (63) thought a middleman could fast-track his liquor licence application. But the madala from Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, was left fuming after he paid Obakeng Motlologane R14 000 but didn’t receive his licence. Jerome said: “He looked like a wise businessman.” He said he gave Obakeng the money in October 2016 and was told he would receive his licence within a month. “Then he started ignoring my calls,” said Jerome. “I then used a different number to call him.” But Obakeng apparently dropped the call when he heard the madala’s voice. Obakeng’s niece looked for him on social media and saw he was living large. “It looks like I helped fund his flashy lifestyle. I decided to forget about the licence and try to get my money back, but it wasn’t easy.” Jerome said he won’t rest until he got a refund. “I really need that money.” When the SunTeam contacted him, Obakeng admitted that he took Jerome’s money and said the madala would get it back. “I withdrew the application I made on his behalf. I will refund him,” he said.
