ARE demons getting you down? If so, prophet Patrick Kaunda is waiting for your call. Patrick claims he uses the Bible to send demons crawling back to hell. He said whenever he prayed for people, he could feel evil spirits leaving their bodies. Patrick said once a demon left a person’s body, he held it prisoner inside his Bible. He said once he cast out a demon, it was gone for good. The prophet from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, reads Matthew 8: 28-31 when he casts out demons. “I don’t believe in using anything other than the holy book,” he said. “Evil spirits fear the word of God because it’s the only thing that can destroy them.” Patrick said evil spirits worked in a specific way. “They block prayers and blessings and cause people to be self-destructive. They make life miserable. “God gave people certain talents, but demons prevent them from reaching their potential.” Daily Sun spoke to a few people who claimed they were healed by Patrick. Gloria Sithole said she was possessed by evil spirits. “I used to say things I couldn’t understand, and the prophet told me it was the demon inside me. “I went to him for help and now I’m cured.” Jonas Sibanda said he was struggling to find a job, but Patrick cast away the spirits that were blocking his blessings. Now Jonas is employed.
