A 27-year-old woman was arrested for faking a cancer diagnosis
to receive well over R720Â 000. The Australian woman used a blog and photographs online to show
an allegedly fictional journey through stage of five ovarian cancer treatment. According to ABC NEWS, police are alleging Wieland told the
community about the huge financial strain the illness had created and
established a donation page that raised almost R720000. The court was told her partner who is a member of the
Australian Defence Force, had become her full-time carer, but police would not
speculate on whether he was aware of the alleged fraud. Wieland had also talked of plans to travel to Germany to
receive further treatment. She was ordered to surrender her passport to police. She is due to appear in court again in December. "Some people in the community identified some problems
with the story and we conducted investigations to establish the veracity of the
claims made by this woman," The police said. "It's disheartening, I mean the real victims here are
the people from the community that have heard the stories, have tried to assist
as best they can and in some cases what little they have and given the money
across in the honest belief they are trying to help people," he said. Inspector Lawson said the allegations against Wieland should
stand as a warning for those wanting to donate online.
