ENERGY FM and Choice FM listeners enjoyed themselves on Saturday when the stations gave them the opportunity to meet their favourite radio personalities. Two double-decker buses transported listeners from Thohoyandou and Polokwane to Euphoria Golf Estate in Mookgopong, Limpopo, for the stations’ birthday celebrations. Energy FM was turning four, while Choice was celebrating its second birthday. DJs from both stations kept the listeners entertained by playing good music throughout the event. Simphiwe Mdlalose, board chairman at both stations, said Energy FM and Choice FM’s fans made them two of the most popular community urban stations in Limpopo. He said the stations held the event to show how much they appreciated their listeners. Simphiwe said the stations’ popularity would continue to grow if they kept their fans happy. “Because Energy and Choice were turning two and four respectively, we thought it was important to acknowledge the people who have supported the stations from day one. “We organised a pool party for the listeners to thank them for being loyal to us and supporting the stations. “We hope the pool party will grow in the near future so our listeners can have a good time with us,” said `Simphiwe. Loyal listener Mbalenhle Molepo (29) from Blood River said the station made her feel appreciated. She said the event gave loyal listeners the opportunity to rub shoulders with their favourite radio personalities. “It was an honour to be invited to the pool party,” she said. “The stations are going to attract more listeners because others will also want to be at the parties.”
