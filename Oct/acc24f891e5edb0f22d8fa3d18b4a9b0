A man
allegedly linked to the murder of Heather Peterson of Westbury has been
arrested. Peterson
was murdered last month in Westbury, Joburg, as a result of gang-related
violence. Her death
sparked riots in Westbury, with residents calling for tough action from the
police in their neighbourhood. According
to Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele, the 32 year-old suspect was arrested
on Sunday afternoon. Information
from the community led the police to trace the suspect to a house in
Krugersdorp, West Rand. The suspect
was arrested and is due to appear at the Joburg Magistrates Court soon for Peterson’s
murder and the attempted murder of her child. The
Minister of Police Bheki Cele and the National Commissioner of Police, General
Khehla John Sitole visited the community following complaints of drug dealing,
corruption and crime in general. After the minister’s
visit in the area, Westbury has been saturated with police officers comprising
of Crime Intelligence, Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks),
Tactical Response Teams, Public Order Police, Visible Policing and an
investigative task team as part of a stabilisation intervention.
