Nyanga is regarded as the murder capital of Mzansi. But residents of the kasi in Cape Town want to take it back to its former glory. They hosted an art festival at the Zolani Centre on Sunday to urge young people to take part in art and not crime. Sakhiwo Gxabhala, a member of the Nyanga Art Forum, said he believed art was the kasi’s only hope. “Through art, this area can develop and become better and safe for our children. “This festival should have happened last year but we didn’t have funds to execute the idea,” said Gxabhala. Noluthando Makasi, chairwoman of the city council, said: “We invited diverse groups of people to come here and perform. “We are trying to show the government there’s hope for Nyanga. It must not only be known as the murder capital but also as a hub for talent.” Scouts from production companies were invited to look for talent and offer advice to the young artists. Makasi vowed to make funds available every year for the festival. “We are working towards uplifting Nyanga,” she said. Afro-jazz singer Sicelo Zonke said he was happy to have been given the platform to perform. “We have been waiting for this opportunity and I believe it will keep the youth off the streets. “The more support we receive from leaders, the better Nyanga will become. I believe every child has a love of art.”
