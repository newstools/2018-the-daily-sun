WHEN the park was built, residents’ children were overjoyed. But it has caused a lot of stress for parents, as they fear it’s a death trap. This is because the park in KwaNyuswa, Durban, is situated right next to the busy Mangqoba Road, on a very sharp bend. Parents said the municipality should either move the park or put a strong wall around it to make sure their children are safe. Sandile Dlamini (46) said the park was built without consultation. “If they had spoken to us, we would have told them the place was not suitable. In 2008, 10 people died when a bus driver lost control at that bend and the vehicle overturned.” Sandile said if a car lost control at the bend while kids were playing on the swings, there could be a disaster. Nompilo Mchunu (40) said whenever she saw kids playing in the park, she was terrified they would be hit by cars. “The kids could also get hit while crossing that dangerous road. Also, there’s a car wash next to the park and the kids could be kidnapped while playing there. That area is not safe,” said Nompilo. Councillor Themba Shelembe said he was aware of the issue and was working to have the park fenced. “At the moment, I’m not sure when a fence will be put up but I think it will be in the next three months.” The SunTeam sent a query to eThekwini Municipality on Thursday and again on Friday but got no response. Another attempt was made yesterday to get comment with no success.
