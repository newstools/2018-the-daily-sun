FeesMustFall activist Mcebo Dlamini has been approached by several ANC branches for the position of the
Youth League President. Dlamini has expressed that he is
ready to lead the governing party’s Youth League. He is expected to stand as a
presidential candidate for the coveted role, which has groomed many political
leaders. Recent media reports state that
several branches like the eMalahleni, Hammanskraal and Amathole have expressed
a desire for Dlamini to lead the party’s youth. In a recent interview, Dlamini has
said that there “isn’t any province that has not approached me.” “When I looked at the number of
people and branches, I couldn’t say no,” he is quoted as saying. The ANCYL elective conference is
set to be held from 18 to 21 October at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Joburg. The conference has been postponed
several times after outgoing president Collen Maine has been accused of trying
to stop the conference from taking place. Dlamini himself is facing multiple
charges including public violence, assault, theft and damage to property
relating to the 2016 FeesMustFall protest.
