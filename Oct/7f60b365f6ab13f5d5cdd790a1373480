IT’S been a month since a mum and her kids went missing. Their disappearance has left their family worried. Thandeka Msomi (28), her daughter Minenhle (5) and son Lindani (2) from Amandawe, KZN went missing on 1 September. They were allegedly last seen walking along the Mpambinyoni bridge towards Scottburgh. Thandeka’s sister-in-law Nonhlanhla Mthethwa (42) said she and her brother, Khaya Mthethwa (36), were not coping since the incident. She said Thandeka and the kids were last seen when she went to collect their grant. “We became worried when they hadn’t come back home in the afternoon. She left with Khaya’s cellphone. But it was off when we called her.” She said Khaya found a cellphone number while cleaning his room the next day. “We called the number and it was answered by a man. “He said he was supposed to meet Thandeka in Pretoria, but she didn’t arrive. We asked him how he knew her. “He said they spoke on social media, but had never met.” Nonhlanhla said: “We searched at hospitals, mortuaries and at her relatives, but there was no sign of them,” she said. Nonhlanhla said she couldn’t sleep at night becauses she was so worried about Khaya. “Khaya told me he wanted to kill himself because the pain was unbearable.” Nonhlanhla said Thandeka and the kids had been living with them for more than five years. “We are confused. But we hope they will come back home safely.” Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said anyone with information should call Warrant Officer Mlungisi Pakkies on 074 4055 326 or on 039 978 1900.
