TEMBISA police and residents recently held an imbizo aimed at addressing crime concerns. The cops pleaded with residents of Winnie Mandela in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, to stop offering them bribes. This comes after the community accused them of failing to stop crime and of taking bribes from dice players. “Police are corrupt and take bribes. They take ages to respond to a complaint,” said a resident. But the cops said it was common for people to offer them money in exhange for their detained relatives’ freedom. The 2017-18 provincial crime stats released earlier last month showed that Tembisa was among the worst-performing cop shops in Gauteng, and that crime in the area was high. Captain Malesela Tefu said: “As police we’re used to getting blamed and accused of taking bribes. “But when we try to enforce the law and arrest a suspect, parents and relatives offer us money not to make arrests. “Stop offering us money and you will see a decline in corruption.” Malesela urged community members to come forward and report corrupt cops.
