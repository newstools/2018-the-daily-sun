HITMEN are allegedly gunning for Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng. But the men allegedly hired to kill him told Mboro they had been promised money to take his life. Mboro claimed the man behind the four attempted hits since April is Jabu Dladla of Zamokuhle Funeral Services. “The hired men confessed they were paid by Dladla but said they can’t kill a prophet who has helped many people,” claimed Mboro. James Ndwadwe, a Gauteng hostel leader, said they told the alleged hitmen not to murder Mboro. “Some of these hired men turned out to be hostel residents. We stopped them because we don’t condone violence and Mboro has helped people in our hostels to bury their loved ones,” claimed Ndwadwe. “We are trying to arrange a meeting between Mboro and Dladla.” A former bodyguard of Mboro told Daily Sun he had twice been offered R10 000 to work with hitmen to kill Mboro. “They said they were hired by Dladla. I refused because that’s not my profession,” he alleged. It’s understood the trouble between Mboro and Dladla went back to 2015 after a dispute over a gogo’s body when the family were apparently treated badly by Dladla. The gogo was a member of Mboro’s Incredible Happenings Church in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. Mboro claimed a family complained that Dladla’s funeral parlour buried their child with missing body parts and in another case a family complained the parlour gave them the wrong body. Mboro claimed he was told Dladla’s business was going down because of what he had said. Dladla said the allegations were all lies. “I don’t know about anything he is accusing me of. My business is doing well and it always has. “I certainly don’t have time to pay attention to what people are saying, especially Mboro. “He is lying. He could only be driven by jealously,” he said. Captain Manare Ramotshela said that a case was opened for investigation but could not confirm the charges.
