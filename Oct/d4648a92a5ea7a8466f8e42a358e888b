MORE than 300 angry people took to the streets yesterday to demand improved services in their village. The residents of Mndozo Village in Newcastle, northern KZN, then marched to the municipal offices to hand over a memorandum of grievances. Resident Mthokozisi Dlamini (30) said they were tired of being sidelined. “The taps are dry in spite of a water project that cost R7,3 million,” he said. “It was never finished as the construction company left in July. “We demand an explanation. We won’t allow corruption in the municipality to make our lives a living hell.” Resident Thulani Moloi (37) said: “All we want is service delivery. We gave the municipality 21 days to get back to us. “If they don’t we’re going to bring Newcastle to a standstill.” The mayor was not there when they reached his offices. Ayanda Masondo from the mayor’s office accepted their memorandum on his behalf. “I’ll make sure the mayor gets your memorandum,” said Masondo. “He’ll go through it and give you a response.” Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane told Daily Sun police were monitoring the situation.
