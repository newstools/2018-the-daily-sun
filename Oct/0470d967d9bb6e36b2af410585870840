TWO taximen did not plead yesterday when they appeared in the South Gauteng High Court sitting in Palm Ridge. A lawyer for one of the accused was unavailable. Prosecutor Rolene Bester said the lawyer had another matter to attend to at another court. Bester told the court the first accused planned to plead guilty to most of the 50 charges, including 13 of rape, nine of kidnapping and nine of robbery with aggravating circumstances. The second accused intended to plead not guilty to all the charges. “Based on the developments in the matter, I submit that the court separates the trials,” said Bester. Xolani Mazibuko, the lawyer for one of the accused, said his client was in jail at the time when the crimes were committed. If the charges against his client were not dropped, the trial would amount to malicious prosecution. He challenged the state to explain how evidence moved between different authorities. Bester told the court they were considering withdrawing some of the charges against Mazibuko’s client. The case against the accused whose lawyer was not in court was rolled over to today, while the case against the other accused was postponed to next Friday.
