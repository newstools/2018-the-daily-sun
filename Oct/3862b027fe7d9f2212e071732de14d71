ACCORDING to Seun Mogotji of the Bolsheviks Party SA, the shortage of medicine at hospitals and clinics is a serious problem and patients are bearing the brunt of it. Eleven children were admitted to Philadelphia Hospital in Moutse outside Groblersdal, Limpopo last Sunday but were left without medication. The kids’ mums were forced to sleep on mattresses on the floor, to be with their sick children. Mogotji told the People’s Paper: “The hospital ran out of medical supplies because the new computer installed to fast track orders and deliveries from the depot to hospitals and clinics is not working. “This led to hospitals and clinics not having enough medication. “Children were in hospital without medicine and they are still without it.” He said Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba should be fired. He said Premier Cassel Mathale should have removed her a long time ago. Neil Shikwambana, a spokesman for the health department, said: “Mothers can’t stay in the paediatric wards and are allocated a different room in the hospital. “We couldn’t put beds in the rooms so we gave them mattresses. “This information was shared with Mogotji, who is a hospital board member. “Instead of working with the hospital, Mogotji saw an opportunity to gain political mileage by taking pictures and writing false statements.” Shikwambana said the clinics were struggling, but hospitals were not affected as they didn’t order from the depot in the first place.
