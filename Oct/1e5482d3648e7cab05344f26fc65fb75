WHEN DJ Petepete spins his discs, people rush to the dance floor. However, the DJ whose real name is Thabo Kobela cannot join them. This is because he is in a wheelchair while he is entertaining them. The 20-year-old from Evaton, the Vaal, told Daily Sun when he was 13, he went to sleep one night and woke up the next day unable to walk. “I was unable to stretch my legs. I thought it was cramps but my legs were not functioning,” he said. Thabo said his mum took him to two sangomas and they both said the same thing. “They told me there’s a black cloud following me and my ancestors because my mum and my father’s sides are against each other,” he said. However, medical doctors later told Thabo he had polio. “By that time, I had accepted my new life in a wheelchair. My mum Annah is also disabled,” he said. Thabo is currently studying at Kgotso Adult School and aims to complete his matric so he can study IT. When he’s performing as DJ Petepete, he drives crowds wild with deep house and hip hop sounds. “Music makes me feel happy and accepted. When people dance to my mix, I just melt,” said Thabo, who has been a DJ for the past five years. He appealed to parents who hide their disabled children at home to stop doing it. “Empower them with skills so they can be independent one day. We are not a burden at all,” said Thabo. He told the SunTeam his only problem was that he needed a new wheelchair.
