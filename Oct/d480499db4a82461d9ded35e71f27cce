Jaguar has unveiled the price for its fully-electric vehicle the I-Pace and it's not cheap. The I-PACE is Jaguar's answer to the Tesla Model X which is another expensive electric SUV. We don't get the model X in South Africa but Tesla has said in the past that the Model 3, their cheapest offering will be coming. The I-Pace is available in three trim levels, the I-Pace S is the cheapest, then you get I-Pace SE. The HSE sits at the top of the range and it comes with all the bells and whistles. The cheapest trim, the S comes in at around R1.6-million with the top of the range trim the HSE coming in at around R1.8-million and there's the First Edition model. The First Edition is basically the top of the range HSE with extra bells and whistle and it will set you back around R1.9-million. The First Edition models will only be available in the first year after the launch of the vehicle. Don't forget to factor in the price for the home charging station. There's only one drivetrain available with a 90-kWh battery. The battery powers tow motor which delivers a combined 294-kW and 696-Nm of torque. 0-100-km/h takes 4.8 seconds, it'll top out at 200-km/h and its 470-km of range under the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). Interestingly the most expensive diesel F-Pace 30d AWD with a 3.0 litre V6 delivering 221-kW and 700-Nm of torque in fancier S trim is still R500 000 cheaper than the cheapest I-Pace.
