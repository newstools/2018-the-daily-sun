The Africa Fashion International Joburg Fashion Week’s Spring/Summer ’19 edition kick off last night at Melrose Arch in Johannesburg and of course it was a flurry of fashion, models, celebrities and influencers. And as much as much the high fashion on the runway is the main attraction, there’s also lots to see off the runway. Nomzamo Mbatha, who had just landed in the country yesterday, pitched up in a stunning, multi-coloured Rich Factory ball gown and matching headpiece. She also walked the runway for the #Dove100ColoursOfAfrica show. Also on the runway was reality TV star, Tebogo PinkyGirl Mekgwe who walked in the Khosi Nkosi show. High profile stylist Kefilwe Mabote pitched up in a jaw-dropping, silver metallic jumpsuit with drapery by, as always, Orapeleng Modutle who was one of the highlight shows of the night. The who’s who of Joburg were spotted at the opening and after party events. Check out the snaps below: Your icons. DONATELLA would be so proud! @aerosouthafrica after party was amazing. #AeroMoments #AFIJFW A post shared by  TROY MOLAIWA ?
