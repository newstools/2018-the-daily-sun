THESE friends are not seeing eye to eye over a shared space. Khabo Manaioa (50) from Ebony Park in Midrand, Gauteing said her relationship with her neighbour, Lebo Mathebula went sour after Lebo built a room in her yard. “I moved from here to live with my husband somewhere else. “We decided to rent out this place. “When my husband and I separated in 2016, I came back home in Ebony Park,” Khabo told Daily Sun. “I found that my neighbour had built a room that seemed to be in my yard. “She also built a wall that made it seem like everything was fine.” Khabo said at first she didn’t think it was a big deal. But when she wanted to renovate her RDP, the person drawing up the housing plans discovered a big problem. “They discovered that a big portion of Lebo’s room was in my yard. “This included an outside toilet,” said Khabo. “I was told that the extension of my house wouldn’t be approved by the municipality.” Khabo claimed when she spoke to Lebo about the matter, she accused her of being jealous of her house. “I was hurt when Lebo said I was jealous. “I just want us to have resolve the issue peacefully because I can’t continue living in a small house,” said Khabo. Lebo said according to her housing plan, everything was in order.
