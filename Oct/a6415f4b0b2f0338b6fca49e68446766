Cape Town
Mayor Patricia De Lille may withdraw her decision to resign as the Mother City
mayor. This was
according to a recent article in the Cape Argus. It was
reported that she is expected to withdraw it 24 hours before a forensic
investigation report implicating her is placed before the City Council. De Lille’s
confidant, Rodney Lentit, is quoted as saying that he advised her against
resigning. He
reportedly spoke to De Lille and advised her to put a hold on resigning until
the matter between her and the Democratic Alliance is fixed. De Lille reached
an agreement to resign after her party agreed to clear her name two months ago. This is
after De Lille threatened to sue certain highly-placed DA officials for
defaming her character in a battle between De Lille and the DA that dragged for
months. A 2000-page
report into corruption and maladministration is expected to be tabled before
the council on Thursday. After the
tabling of the report, a decision will be made whether De Lille, suspended MMC
of transport and urban development Brett Herron and other officials should face
criminal charges. Sources
within the party are quoted as saying that they were aware of De Lille’s plan
not to resign. “If she
does not want to resign, she will be removed by a motion of no confidence and
all other charges and disciplinary action against her will be re-instituted,”
the source reportedly said.
