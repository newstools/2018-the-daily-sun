It seems like Lebani Sirenje who is a popular
celebrity funeral artist just can’t get his paintings to look accurate. As he was busy painting a portrait of Iconic Motswako
rapper Jabulani ‘HHP’ Tsambo at the Newtown Music Factory former Baseline,
Twitter began saying the portrait isn’t accurate. Some went on to say: “Rasta at it again, that's
not Jabba, that's not HHP.” While others began asking questions as to who
keeps on giving the artist the tenders to paint the portraits.
