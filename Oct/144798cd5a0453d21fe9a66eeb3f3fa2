EMPLOYEES at Table Pride Foods on Victoria Street in the Durban CBD say they have to use their toilets as a dining and change-room. They told Daily Sun this has been going on for three weeks. One worker (27) said they were not told why they were kicked out of their old room. “The employer simply called two employees and told them to move our lockers from the change-room to the toilets. “Without any explanation, he then locked the change-room and told us we were now going to use the toilets.” Another employee (29) said before they went to the labour department to lodge a complaint, they raised it with their employer but he said nothing. “The department said it will take up to five weeks for them to inspect the situation, but we feel this is too long.” The employee said they don’t believe what the employer is doing to them is right. “I’ve never heard of a human being forced to eat his lunch in a place designed to relieve themselves. It is an insult to our dignity,” He said when toilets were turned into change-rooms, only one was left for them to relieve themselves in. They wanted authorities to intervene. KZN labour spokesman Nhlanhla Khumalo said: “The department knows nothing about this and we encourage workers to report such behaviour at work places. We will send our inspectors to ensure compliance with regulations.” Attempts to get comment from Table Pride Foods were fruitless. The telephone was answered by a receptionist who said store manager Jannie Govender was not at work. When Daily Sun went to the store, administrative staff kept showing us different entrances that led nowhere and Govender’s number was on voicemail. The receptionist promised to give him the reporter’s number.
