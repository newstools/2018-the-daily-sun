CONFUSION reigned among ANC members on Friday after their case was postponed. Pietermaritzburg High Court judge Jerome Mnguni said the matter between the new Harry Gwala regional executive committee and unhappy branches couldn’t continue as the applicants hadn’t filed their papers. Mnguni postponed the case to 29 October. Outside court, members of the branches insisted they had filed their papers on Tuesday. Themba Mahlaba, the first applicant, said their papers had been ready by Tuesday. New Harry Gwala regional secretary Sindisiwe Msomi said as respondents they, too, had been ready for a decision by the court but were now confused. On Friday, the judge was supposed to make a ruling on whether the conference was to be set aside and on the legitimacy of the leadership. The case was heard earlier this month. The region is without leaders after the court ruled that the new leaders shouldn’t do their work until the case was finalised.
