A MAN made a massive mistake when he felt sorry for two hitchhikers. Shortly after picking up the two men, one of them took out an axe and hit the driver on the head! The driver lost control and crashed into another car. The driver and the man with the axe were seriously injured but his accomplice managed to escape. When the cops arrived, the driver managed to tell the cops and paramedics what had happened. They were both taken to hospital and the hijacker was placed under police guard. Warrant Officer Raymond Sebonyane said the incident happened on the R28 road near Speruperu Modderfontein squatter camp in Westonaria, Rand West City. “The victim said he was driving alone towards Vereeniging and the suspects were standing near the Engen garage when he offered them a lift,” he said. “When police arrived on the scene, the victim managed to identify the suspect, who was in the ambulance.” Sebonyane said the suspect has been charged with assault and attempted hijacking. The suspect will appear in court when he’s medically fit. He urged anyone with information on the second suspect to contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
