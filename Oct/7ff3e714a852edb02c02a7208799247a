STRUGGLE icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela might be gone, but her contribution will never be forgotten. Today, she was honoured with a doctorate in social sciences at Walter Sisulu University’s graduation ceremony in Mthatha. While accepting the honorary doctorate, eldest daughter Zenani Dlamini started crying. “Trust me, these are tears of joy. I stand in place of my mother to accept this honorary doctorate with pride and gratitude,” she said. She said she and sister Zindzi would always treasure the honour. Zenani told the graduates: “If my mother could have spoken with you here today, she would have said even though you have already jumped over, there are still more hurdles ahead of you. “You must go out there and achieve the very best that you can. My mother would have urged you to push on no matter what and never to give up on your belief in yourself. “Always remember that you have a university qualification that you can use to improve the lives of your family and those yet to be born.” University vice-chancellor Rob Midgley said mama Madikizela-Mandela was a wonderful example, especially for young women. “We are proud to be associated with her. She has been honoured all over the world but not in her own country. The struggle will always continue,” he said. Student leader Mxolisi Zoko said: “We are calling on the university to keep honouring such heroes. “We raised her name while she was alive and are disappointed she is not here to accept this herself.” Madikizela-Mandela was supposed to receive the doctorate at the university’s May graduation ceremony, but she died two weeks before the event.
