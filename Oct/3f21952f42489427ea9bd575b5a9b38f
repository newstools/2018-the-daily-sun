HOUSE DJ and producer Brazo Wa Afrika said it wasn’t easy for people to recognise him and give his sound a chance. The musician, whose real name is Keletjo Manyaka, told SunBuzz: “It took me many years to make it as a producer and DJ. But I’ve been working hard since high school. When I was 16 I was signed under a small record label, but things didn’t go as I had hoped. But I never gave up.” Last month he released a single titled Appreciated. “I’m excited about my new single,” said Brazo. “I’ve worked with a new artist on the single and people love it already. “I believe it’s going to be big.” He has worked with Uncle Chriz on the song. “I met Uncle Chriz on social media and he told me he was an artist,” he said. “I told him I was busy with a song and he asked me to feature him. “I sent everything to him via Twitter and it was recorded in a day.” Although he did a BSc in computer and mathematical sciences, he always wanted to be a producer and DJ.
