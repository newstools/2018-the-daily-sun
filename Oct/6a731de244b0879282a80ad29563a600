WOMEN students at the Durban University of Technology have come up with new ways to prevent cops from intimidating them during protests. Yesterday, they started protesting with their breasts on full display! They told Daily Sun this was the only way they could prevent cops from manhandling them while they were fighting for their rights. Second-year accounting student Ayanda Nene (20) said the police had no idea what it was like to have a parent who couldn’t afford to support them. Ayanda said they were protesting because their rights were being violated by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. She said at the beginning of the year the scheme agreed to take care of all their expenses, but later abandoned students. “I was supposed to get my food allowance in July but I’m still waiting. How am I supposed to study on an empty stomach?” she said. Student representative council president Sesiyanda Godlimpi said they would continue to protest until they got what they wanted. “Students are hungry. What angers them is the fact that NSFAS hasn’t explained why the payments have been delayed,” he said. University spokesman Alan Khan said management understood the students’ complaints. “Management commits to convincing NSFAS to comply with the deadline dates,” he said. Acting NSFAS spokeswoman Phatisa Ntlonze said the scheme received the SunTeam’s inquiry. But yesterday she said: “I’ve just been informed that management is in an urgent meeting that is scheduled to end at 4pm. “I apologise for the delay. I will forward the responses as soon as I receive them.”
