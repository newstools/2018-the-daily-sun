READY, steady, go! The class of 2018 is starting their final exams today, and many wished them well. The first exam most pupils will write is English. On Friday residents, churches and cops prayed for them at Mandisa Shiceka Secondary School in Kagiso, Mogale City. Excited pupils told Daily Sun they wouldn’t disappoint those who had placed their faith in them. Boitumelo Noge (17) said she had been working hard the whole year. Joel Ngobese (18) said he wanted to do well in maths and science as he wanted to study medicine next year. Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga also wished the pupils well. Motshekga said the department left no stone unturned to ensure the exams were well run. “The department had an intensive review of all its systems to limit the challenges we experienced in the past,” said Motshekga. She said this year the department would administer a sign language exam at home language level to 58 deaf pupils across 10 schools. “The question papers will be in sign language and pupils will respond by signing. “This will be recorded using the appropriate technology,” she said. Motshekga said technical mathematics and technical science would also be offered for the first time this year. A total of 147 National Senior Certificate question papers have been set, internally moderated by the department and approved by Umalusi. “The question papers have been adapted for blind and deaf candidates. “Braille question papers for the blind and enlargements of font sizes for the partially blind will be available.” Exams kicked off last Monday with Computer Applications Technology. Yesterday, languages such as French and Mandarin were also written. This year, a total of 796 542 matric pupils will sit for the exams, which will end on 28 November.
