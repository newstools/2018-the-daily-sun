YOUNG Siyanda Mncube died in a hail of bullets when he and three friends were shot by unknown gunmen. The 17-year-old will never get to see his unborn child. Since receiving news of his death his baby mama, who is expected to give birth this month, has not stopped crying. Siyanda, Sphamandla Dlamini (17), Sanele Khuzwayo (21) and Tumelo Nkonka (24) were shot dead in a shack in Umlazi K section, south of Durban, on Saturday. Sanele and Tumelo died at the scene. Siyanda and Sphamandla died later at the Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital. Siyanda’s mum Thembelihle (49) said she was deeply saddened. “We’re finding it hard to cope with the loss. It’s even harder for his baby mama. “She’s been crying nonstop and can’t even speak about the pain she’s feeling,” said Thembelihle. She said doctors wouldn’t allow her to see him and only told her Siyanda had facial injuries and was in a bad state. Captain Nqobile Gwala said murder charges were being investigated by Bhekithemba cops. “Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” she said. “We appeal to anyone with information to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111.”
