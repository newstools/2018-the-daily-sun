Controversial poet, Ntsiki Mazwai has weighed in on the drama that has unfolded in Westbury, Johannesburg. Westbury residents took to the streets in protest last week after a woman was killed and a 10-year-old was injured during a shoot-out. The residents have allegedly vowed to shut down the area while they mourn the loss of the 45-year-old woman. PICS: RESIDENTS SHUTDOWN WESTBURY! They have also called for police or the army to be deployed to the area to curb the drug and crime scourge. The violence continued in the streets in Westbury on Monday and a Rea Vaya bus station was set alight. Although she first called for an end to the violence in Westbury last week, Nstiki has come out to say that the community was a ticking time bomb, just waiting to explode. WE'RE TIRED OF GANGSTARS - DEPLOY THE ARMY! Ntsiki, who is known to share her controversial views without fear or favour, has called the largely coloured community of Westbury “a silenced voice”. “It was just a matter of time. Coloured people in SA were always a ticking time bomb. A silenced voice,” she said. “Tjerrrrr a coloured people don't mind a good fight yazi. The revolution might be here. Amongst all the Africans, coloured people got the "fight gene". I don't think this is about to end we need to pay attention,” she continued. MADALA SHOT IN WESTBURY SHUTDOWN!
