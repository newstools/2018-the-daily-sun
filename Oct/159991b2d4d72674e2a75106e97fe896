THERE was much excitement when high school girls were awarded special certificates on Monday afternoon in Bloemfontein. A group of 21 girls participated in Vodacom’s Code Like a Girl training programme in partnership with the department of education in the Free State. “A week ago we had 21 pupils who came for training. “Most of them saw a coding programme for the very first time. “One week later we have girls who have built their own websites with confidence,” said Mamello Selamolela, the company’s executive manager in the Free State and Northern Cape. “We look forward to seeing them become future leaders.” The district director of education in the Motheo district, December Moloi, said: “This programme prepares girls for a career in a technological world. “They have been given life skills and motivation to thrive through their education until they complete their grade 12. “The contribution made by Vodacom levels the playing field for girl pupils,” said Moloi. Retshegofaditswe Mokhethi (16), a grade 11 pupil at Albert Moroka High School based in Thaba Nchu, won a prize for the best website. She said: “I feel so excited and so overwhelmed. I can’t explain the feeling of contentment that I feel right now. I never thought I would be chosen as the best website creator. “I came here knowing nothing. “I would like thank the department of education and Vodacom for changing my life,” said Retshegofaditswe.
