Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has revealed that he is set to appear before the Premier Soccer League's Disciplinary Committee for an altercation with a security official after the game against AmaZulu on 16 September. Mosimane was involved in a scuffle with an official after a supporter invaded the pitch, although it is believed that the individual was not hostile and merely wanted to show appreciation towards Mosimane for the work he has done at Sundowns. However, the unnamed official acted aggressively in grabbing the fan at which point the former Bafana Bafana boss intervened and a scuffle ensued. As such, the 54-year-old says he will face the DC although he is not pleased about the circumstances behind it in doing so. Speaking to reporters, Mosimane said:“I was called by the DC, it's an assault. Against Barca, a supporter came in. You were there, what did I do? I hugged him, I ushered him out. It's not the first time I usher them out. That's what happened in Durban. It's an assault.“Where is the human part of football? Can I show that against the other team? I saw another coach in Maritzburg United's Mandla Ncikazi, a good friend. He did this [points a finger] to [Ernst] Middendorp.“Remember that case? How long did it take? It took a year. He did this to the referee live on TV. If I do that it's a life sentence.”
