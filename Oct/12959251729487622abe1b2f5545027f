A MAN who died mysteriously has been laid to rest. Hundreds of mourners gathered at Musa Nukeri’s house in Rolle outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge on Saturday. Nukeri’s body was found at his house on 22 September. Speakers expressed great sorrow over his death. Musa’s uncle Elliot Nukeri (74) said it was not easy for the family to come to terms with the situation. “His death raised many questions, but we do not have any answers. “May his soul rest in peace,” said Elliot. Cousin Patrick Chiloane (41) said it seemed Musa died in agony. “He had blood in his mouth and his hands were crossed over his chest. “It was clear he died in pain,” he said. However, a post mortem revealed Musa died of natural causes. “But we have to accept the doctor’s findings. “The post mortem report said he died because he was bleeding from the nose and mouth.” Willias Chiloane (65), Musa’s other uncle, described his nephew as a people’s person. Residents believe Musa was killed by people who wanted to use his blood for muthi. Community leader Joel Hlungwane (74) said an urgent meeting would be held with residents to discuss crime in the area.
