KAK has invaded Ephraim’s yard and he has had enough! Some of his family have moved away from his house. Ephraim Budaga (65) from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni said he had lost friends because of the sewage in his yard. “If I were in my friends’ shoes, I’d probably stay away too. I don’t even enjoy food at home anymore,” said Ephraim. He told Daily Sun that the sewage drain burst in 2015 and his life has been hell since. “Things have turned sour. I don’t have people visiting me anymore. Whenever the drain bursts, my neighbours laugh at me because I have to step on beer crates to get to my house,” he said. Ephraim said whenever the sewage drain bursts, water in the taps becomes dirty. “When this happens, we can’t cook. We have to buy takeaways, which are expensive. “We can’t live like this anymore.” According to the madala, he and his 34-year-old son have health problems because of the sewage. He has given up on the municipality because he had reported the matter countless times and he said his complaints fell on deaf ears. Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said the water and sanitation department was attending to the complaint. He said the complaint involved a private dispute between the owner and another house owner downstream. “The city’s by-laws make it clear that the house downstream must accept the storm water from the house upstream. In this case, the house owner at the lower end has closed the boundary wall, which stops water from running into the street. This causes an overflow in the sewer line. “This is not the fault of the municipal pipe network. “The owner has been told what the problem is and advised on what can be done to manage the storm water.”
