THE family of Caiphus Chiloane wants justice for the murder of their loved one. The 56-year-old was a teacher at Chueu Primary School in Rooiboklaagte. He was murdered allegedly during a hijacking in Green Valley outside Acornhoek, Mpumalanga, last Wednesday at about 9pm. A suspect (29) appeared briefly in the Acornhoek Magistrates Court on Tuesday. He faces charges of murder, hijacking and kidnapping. He will appear for a formal bail application on 7 November. Speaking to Daily Sun, Caiphus’ brother Henry Chiloane (53) said his brother left home at about 5pm in his Toyota bakkie and never came home. He said they received a call later that night from neighbours who had spotted the damaged bakkie parked at an RDP in Orpen Gate. Later, they received a call from cops saying a body had been dumped on the R40. “It turned out the dead man was our brother,” said Henry. Angry residents have since attacked and killed a 33-year-old suspect they believe was connected to the murder. Police spokeswoman Captain Mpho Nonyane said: “Police recovered the partly damaged car belonging to the dead man at an RDP in Orpen Gate.” Nonyane confirmed another suspect’s death after he was attacked by angry residents.
