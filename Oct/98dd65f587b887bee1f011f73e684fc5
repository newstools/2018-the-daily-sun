YET another “baby factory” has been bust in Nigeria, this
one involving a church and 16 pregnant teenagers, all younger than 18. According to Punch, a church cleric and three other
people were running the baby factory in the Mount Sinai Ministry at Rukpokwu,Port
Harcourt. For years baby factories have been a national disgrace in
Nigeria, where kids are sold for adoption or slave labour, or even killed for
muthi. The kids are usually sold to traffickers by their
families, and then traded on illegal international adoption markets. The cleric who was the mastermind behind the most recent
scandal was named as Gloria Raphael. One of the young pregnant women, Sandra Solomon, said she
was unmarried and desperate. “I became pregnant and I did not know what to do. So, a
lady told me that they sell babies in that church and I came there. The woman
did not tell me how much they sell. I don’t want to sell my baby. “As we were sleeping in the church, police came and
arrested all of us.” Pregnant Favour Gabriel (17) said that the man who made
her pregnant bought her to the church and promised to take her back after she’d
delivered her child. State Commissioner of Police, Zaki Ahmed said: “Sixteen
pregnant women awaiting delivery and onward sale of the children to the waiting
buyers were arrested. One of them by name Chinyere Nweke had labour yesterday
(Friday) and was rushed to the police clinic where she gave birth to a baby
girl.” In April this year, 257 illegal baby factories were
uncovered in just one state in Nigeria. In the same month, 160 babies were rescued from a baby
factory in Lagos.
