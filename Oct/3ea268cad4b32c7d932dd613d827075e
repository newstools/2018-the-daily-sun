“THE Macufe Cup trophy is not happy there in Naturena, it must come back home.” That is a verbatim quote by Bloemfontein Celtic captain Patrick Tignyemb ahead of the annual festival scheduled for Free State Stadium on Sunday (3pm). Siwelele’s first choice goalkeeper says they will go all out to avenge last year’s 4-2 defeat to Amakhosi at the same venue. It is Celtic’s current coach, Steve Komphela, who guided Chiefs to that memorable win which still haunts Tignyemb and his teammates. Komphela was sacked by Amakhosi last season after his failure to win any of the major competitions in three years, lifting only the Bokone Bophirima Maize Cup and Black Label Cup. The Cameroonian international is looking forward to a mouth-watering 90 minutes as they strive to give fans reason to smile, having lost 2-0 to Free State Stars in their last Absa Premiership game at the weekend. The 33-year-old has been involved in Macufe for longer than any other player in the team. “The Macufe Cup has been part of the Celtic culture since I arrived in South Africa 10 years ago. It’s always nice to take part in the competition since there is a lot of entertainment. It’s a nice friendly against a big team. We want revenge because Macufe belongs in Bloemfontein.” Tignyemb says this is also an opportunity for fringe players to impress Komphela and increase their chances of being considered for the starting lineup when Celtic resume their league campaign against Baroka at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium on 28 October. “We have prepared normally like we do for any league game, there is nothing new. We know our fans will fill the stadium because they always rally behind the team. We are highly motivated. It’s important to win the trophy so that we can channel our focus back to the league.”
