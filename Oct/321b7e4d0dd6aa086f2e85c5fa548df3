WARDERS at the Boksburg Correctional Services in Ekurhuleni are tired of favouritism at the centre. According to one of the warders, officers who are close to management receive special treatment. He claimed they literally get away with murder. “Last Wednesday, two inmates tried to kill a warder. “When they were taken away to be beaten up, one of the inmates cut a supervisor on the head with a razor. “He was beaten to death by warders,” said the warder. “The other one was moered until he confessed that he was instructed by another inmate to kill the officer.” He claimed that all warders were told during a parade to keep the death a secret. “A member from management told us to keep this to ourselves because those inmates deserved what they got. “He said this would send a clear message to the inmates not to mess with warders.” The officer told Daily Sun that a similar incident happened in 2016, where an inmate stabbed another inmate to death and was beaten to death by warders. “Five officers beat up that inmate. Three were suspended while two were reinstated after two months. “Why were we not asked to keep the matter to ourselves that time? It just shows that they were not part of the favourites,” he claimed. He claimed some warders get away with a lot. “They never get reprimanded, but if one of us who are not part of the favourites do something wrong, they are quick to act,” he said. Gauteng Correctional Services spokesman Pat Thobejane said: “An offender lost his life and an official was stabbed after two inmates got into a fight.” He added that allegations of favouritism were baseless but the department would investigate the allegations.
