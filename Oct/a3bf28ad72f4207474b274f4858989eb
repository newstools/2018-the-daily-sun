JOBURG Metro Police and cops evicted people who illegally occupied houses in Lehae, south of Joburg, Monday morning. Nkele Mabhena (55), chairwoman of Dingindawo Dwellers, said it has been 22 years since she applied for an RDP. “I have been applying for an RDP since 1996, but we are still homeless. “These houses were built three years ago and some are incomplete. We moved in on Friday because we realised that if we don’t take matters into our own hands the houses will be occupied by random people,” said Nkele. She said they tried to speak to the relevant authorities about the houses, but nothing happened. She said they even tried building shacks in the area, but Metro cops removed them. “We were told not to erect any shacks because they don’t want shacks in Lehae – but they leave us no choice. “Where are we supposed to live with our children? “We are tired of living in cramped spaces. We need homes,” said Nkele. A resident said she was stranded and did not know where she and her kids would go because she left her shack and told her mastandi she now had a house. “I should not have acted so quickly. “Where am I going to go with all these kids? “I have no one and nowhere to go. “I will sleep in this house as it is. I do not have a choice.” Lehae councillor Ace Mokonyane said he held several meetings with residents and had asked them not to occupy the houses. “I told them I can’t give them permission to illegally occupy the houses. I warned them there would be evictions if they continued living in the houses.” Metro Police spokesman Wayne Minnaar confirmed that 24 RDP houses were illegally occupied and officers had removed the people occupying them.
