TSHEPO Mofokeng thought he had entered the wrong shack when he got home! The door was open and his TV and music system were gone. Although he had left the door locked when he went to work the night before, he found it broken when he came back in the morning. The once full wardrobe was empty, except for one T-shirt. The 35-year-old from Marry Me in Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, said he couldn’t believe what he was seeing when he arrived home on 12 September. He said he went to his neighbours to ask what had happened, but they too were shocked. “There were signs of forced entry. It looked like the thugs fought with the door,” he told Daily Sun. He said he was surprised that no one heard anything. “It’s clear that a lot of noise was made when they broke my door. Some people must have heard something,” said Tshepo. He later heard powerful people in the kasi were against him. “I believe people who heard what happened are afraid to give me information,” he said. Soshanguve police spokeswoman Constable Zanele Mtsweni said cases of theft and housebreaking were opened.
