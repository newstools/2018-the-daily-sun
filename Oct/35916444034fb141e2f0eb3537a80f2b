WORKERS believe eThekwini’s cake is big enough for all to share and they also want a piece of it. The workers from eThekwini Municipality’s expanded public works programme shut down eight solid waste depots in Durban and protested outside the head office in Springfield yesterday. The workers painted the entrance blue and orange as they held placards and chanting songs. They demanded permanent jobs. Protest leader Sifiso Mdletshe told Daily Sun they signed a two-year contract when they were hired in 2014. “We were promised we’d be hired permanently at a later stage but that never happened,” said Sifiso. Their contracts were instead reduced to six months in 2015. “This year, we got one-month contracts. In January, the municipality hired only 150 workers and 700 were left out. They promised that more workers would be hired in July,” he said. But July passed and no one was hired. “We wrote a letter to the head of cleaning and solid waste on 7 September asking when the 700 workers would be hired. “We gave them a week to respond but they never did. We decided to shut down eight depots since they ignored us. Maybe this is the language they will understand,” Sifiso said. eThekwini spokesman Mandla Nsele said the municipality was negotiating with workers in order for work to continue.
