NOMTHETHO Sodlulashe (29) and Zinathi Ngwangwe will never forget this year’s Women’s Month. The friends from Alexandra, east of Joburg, were in the wrong place at the wrong time on 15 August. They almost lost their lives. They said they now lived in fear as the man who tried to kill them was still on the loose. They were allegedly attacked by an ex-boyfriend of Nomthetho’s sister. He hasn’t been bust, even though a case was opened. “We are worried he might come back to finish us off,” Nomthetho said. “Cops are just dragging their feet. The man should have been arrested by now.” Nomthetho said the man had been waiting at her sister’s house, but she didn’t arrive. “We had just came back from the local mall when we found the man in my sister’s house. We asked him how he got in. “He said he used a remote control,” Nomthetho said. She said the man asked them about her sister’s new boyfriend. “He asked if we knew where my sister’s new boyfriend lived. He then told us to take him there. But before we could go, he forced us to drink mageu, saying it would make us brave,” she said. “He kept asking us if we were not feeling dizzy or sick. We knew something was wrong.” After an hour, Nomthetho asked the man if she could fetch her child from creche. But the man said Zinathi should go. “Just after my friend left, he took out a panga from a black plastic bag and slashed me with it. “I screamed for my life and tried to stop him with my hands. He chopped off one of my fingers. “I pushed him away and ran to the neighbours for help,” she said. Nomthetho said no one wanted to stop the man as he had a gun. “I have lost my finger because of this man. All I want is for him to be arrested,” she said. Zinathi said she was lucky to have survived the horror. “The man is evil. I thought he was going to kill us.” Police spokesman Captain Stephen Malatji said he knew nothing about the case and only took down the case number the team gave him.
