FAMILIES of the 26 victims of the horrific N1 accident on Friday have identified the bodies of their loved ones. The accident involving a truck and three vehicles, including a 22-seater minibus, happened on Friday. The bus was coming from Bochum in the Blouberg Municipality outside Polokwane, transporting passengers to Tembisa, Gauteng. The smash took place between Modimolle and Mookgopong in Limpopo. A Nissan NP200 bakkie caught fire but the passengers survived. It is alleged that the front wheel of a truck carrying cement had a puncture and the driver lost control of it, ploughing into oncoming traffic. The accident happened just two weeks after the start of Transport Month. The families met with the premier of Limpopo, Stan Mathabatha. Mathabatha said the provincial government had formed a task team to assist the families who had suffered emotional and psychological trauma. “We want to have a mass funeral, but that would depend on the families,” he said. Thabo Masipa, whose younger sister Precious Masipa (23) lost her life, said: “We are still shocked and emotionally hurt.” President Cyril Ramaphosa sent his “heartfelt condolences” to the families. Last month 20 people died in accidents on the N1 between Polokwane and Modimolle.
