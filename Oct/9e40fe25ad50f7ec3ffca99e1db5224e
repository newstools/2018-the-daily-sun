EVERYTHING changed overnight for a security guard last month. This is because the 42-year-old from Cape Town won the R64 million Lotto jackpot. Speaking to Daily Sun, the winner, who wanted to remain anonymous, said he left to attend a ceremony in his home town in Limpopo and left the ticket behind. After the numbers were chosen on the 18th of last month, his wife phoned to say his ticket had won. He said at first he didn’t believe her, but was shocked when he returned home and checked the quick pick ticket he bought for R60 at a cafe near their house. “I just stood there. I didn’t know what to do or say,” he said. The man said he applied for sick leave from his job of three years to digest the news, but he didn’t think he would return to work. He said the first thing on his mind was to marry the mum of his two children and to build her a mansion. “We have been through a lot together. It has been 18 years,” he said. He said he would buy a Mercedes-Benz, his dream car, and start a soccer team. “I played soccer after matric, but I had to stop and look for work because I was raised by a single mum.” The man, who has been living in a backroom at the home of his wife’s boss, said he played Lotto every week and encouraged others to continue buying tickets. “My dream has come true. Yours can too,” he said. Khensani Mabuza of lottery operator Ithuba said even if people don’t win, 27% of the price of every ticket went to good causes.
