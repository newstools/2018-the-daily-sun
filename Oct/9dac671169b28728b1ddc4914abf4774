THE 92-year-old gogo was allegedly so scared of a man she knew well that she went to sleep at a relative’s house last Tuesday. And her fears were tragically confirmed when gogo Rebeccah Ramadimetja was murdered a day later! The 36-year-old suspect allegedly called the police and gave them directions to gogo Rebeccah’s house in Ga-Chuene outside Lebowakgomo, Limpopo, after strangling her. He was later arrested and is due in court this week. It’s believed the suspect accused gogo Rebeccah of being responsible for the death of his mum, who died in childbirth when he was just five years old. Relative Matseke Chuene (59) told Daily Sun the family was in shock. “The cops woke me up to tell me she had been murdered and when I arrived at the scene, there were police everywhere. I was shocked when they told me the suspect had phoned them and told them to arrest him.” Matseke said the gogo told her the suspect had accused her of being responsible for his mum’s death and had threatened to kill her. “She slept at my house on Tuesday night and returned to her house the next day.” Matseke said the window of the gogo’s bedroom was broken, which was how her killer got into the house. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba condemned the gruesome murder. “I urge community members to refrain from resorting to violence, especially against vulnerable citizens.”
