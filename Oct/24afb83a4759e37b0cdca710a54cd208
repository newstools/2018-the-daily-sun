EKURHULENI’S Title Deeds Friday programme continues to bring much relief to its residents. The municipality’s spokesman, Themba Gadebe, said the programme brought special comfort to elderly residents who were anxious to leave their grandchildren with a secure roof over their heads if they died un-expectedly. “Gogo Betty Chiloane (79) of Chief Albert Luthuli extension 5 was one of those who received title deeds at Marivate Hall in Daveyton. This was during the Siyaqhuba Title Deeds Friday drive last week,” said Gadebe. He said gogo Betty was one of 150 residents of Chief Albert Luthuli whose title deeds were ready to be handed over. “On the day, 35 residents received their deeds. Those who were not at the hall can collect theirs at the Daveyton Customer Care Centre at a convenient time for them.” Gogo Betty said she was grateful to the city for giving them secure ownership of their houses. “I have never been happier. Now we have a secure home,” said the gogo. Doctor Xhakaza, MMC for finance and economic development, who officiated at the handover, urged recipients to keep their documents safe. “This document gives you security of tenure. It says you are the owner of the house and the land it is built on. It is the legacy that you may leave for your descendants,” he said. Xhakaza said since the mayor introduced the title deeds programme, the city was pushing back the backlog of uncollected title deeds.
