VENTERSDORP cops were on high alert yesterday following a violent strike on Wednesday in which 11 people were arrested. Suspects were charged with public violence and expected to appear in the Ventersdorp Magistrates Court today. North West police spokesman Captain Sam Tselanyane said police confronted community members who continued to gather in groups and throw stones at police vehicles. Community leader Sello Dassie said the strike would continue. He said many people were arriving from work to demand that their friends and children be released. “We don’t understand why some of our people were arrested when they didn’t hurt anyone.” Dassie added: “The way in which they were arrested was not right either. Police broke into houses to arrest them. “We want them freed because those arrested did nothing wrong.” As the strike went on, children were stopped from going to school and shops in town were closed down. Roads in the area remained barricaded with rocks and burning tyres. The strike was temporarily suspended in August after community members were promised their service delivery demands would be attended to by the JB Marks Municipality. But residents said five weeks later, not a single promise made by the municipality had been delivered. The strike started again on Monday. Residents said they would continue protesting until a new electricity tariff was implemented, the long delayed N14 development project was launched, and the old Ventersdorp Municipality was brought back.
