OVER the past few years, at least seven pupils in Masodi, Mokopane have been run over by cars. The kids were on their way to school when the accidents took place. To keep pupils safe, DA Limpopo candidate for premier Jacques Smalle handed over road safety equipment to the community on Tuesday. Smalle gave the residents stop signs, traffic cones and reflector jackets. He said the party handed over the equipment because it cared about pupils’ safety. “This village has already lost seven pupils and that number is too high. “Those pupils didn’t get to enjoy their youth or start their own families,” said Smalle. “We hope the residents and schools will use the equipment and make sure children are safe when they go to, or return from, school. “We need to make sure no other child dies.” Smalle said parents should create volunteer groups to help kids cross the road. “We will talk to the traffic department so they can teach the parents how and when to use the equipment.” Smalle said his party would also engage with other stakeholders to make sure the volunteers got a stipend. More equipment will also be donated to the village. Resident Agnes Tuuyawana said the community was grateful for the DA’s intervention. She said: “Our children come first. Now that this equipment has been donated, we hope our children will be safe.”
