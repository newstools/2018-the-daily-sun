Star of the 1Magic hit telenovela, The River, Linda Mtoba is in America living out all of our dream vacations. In fact, she’s been there with her hubby for a few weeks now and seems to be loving every minute of it. Her adventures began in Atlanta, Georgia where she ate at some fancy diners and at the famous Cheesecake Factory and of course, did a little shopping. She then moved things off to the Big Apple, New York City where her pictures have left everyone green with envy. There she visited the Clinton Street Baking Company, Sugar Factory American Brasserie, she visited another Sugar Factory in the Meatpacking District of New York, she of course went to Time Square, she shopped in Soho, and ate at the popular Red Lobster. As if that was not enough, she has also visited the Color Factory and a disco bar called Le Bain on the rooftop of the fabulous Standard Hotel. Check out all the fun snaps below: Atlanta was a great experience. The fooood ??
