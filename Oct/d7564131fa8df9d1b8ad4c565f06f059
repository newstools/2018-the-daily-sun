THE Eastern Cape Department of Health has warned parent to
lookout for the whooping cough symptoms in children. The warning comes after an outbreak of the Bordetella
Pertussis in Nelson Mandela Bay, which has led to one fatality. Eastern Cape Department of Health spokesperson, Lwandile
Sicwetsha, said 26 cases of whooping cough have been reported by the
departmental outbreak response team. “Of these (26 cases), 13 were reported in the private health
facilities and the other 13 were reported at public healthcare facilities. This
infectious disease poses a threat to communities,” Sicwetsha said. Sicwetsha said the department is also sending outreach teams
to check ‘Road to Health’ cards and immunization for children. “The first symptoms of whooping cough are similar to those
of a common cold. These include a runny nose, sneezing, mild cough and
low-grade fever. After about one to two weeks, the dry, irritating cough
evolves into coughing spells. During a coughing spell, which can last for more
than a minute, a child may turn red or purple. At the end of a spell, the child may make the characteristic
whooping sound when breathing in or may vomit,” The disease is reportedly curable if it is detected during
the early stages. “Parents are encouraged to follow the immunization schedule
to reduce chances of contracting the disease,” Sicwetsha said.
