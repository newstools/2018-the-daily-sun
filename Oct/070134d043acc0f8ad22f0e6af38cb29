The South African Traditional Music Achievement (SATMA) Awards closed off Heritage month in fine style this past weekend. The awards were again held at Mmabatho Convention Centre in the North West Province - Bokone Bophirima. Running in the 13th year, the SATMA awards celebrate tradition, culture and heritage. The theme for this year’s ceremony was “Embracing your Heritage” Playing hosts this year was the trio of funnyman Pule Skhothane who kept the audience in stitches, singer and actress KB who brought elegance and finally peot Botlhale Boiokanyo who is known to represent her culture to the fullest. Headline performances came from the likes of Distruction Boyz, Sjava, Phuzekhemisi, Papa Penny, Abathandwa and Mafikizolo to name a few. Some of the winners included Amagcokama who took home the hotly contested Best Maskandi Album and Best Male Artist. Benny Mayengani took home the Best Traditional Xitsonga Album, solidifying his spot at the top of the pile when it comes to Xitsonga traditional music. Every year the SATMA Awards honour a legend and a veteran who has played a pivotal role in changing and influencing the public positively. His Majesty King Hinsta (of the Xhosa Kingdom) was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award along with Ukhozi FM's DJ Khathide "Tshatha" Ngobe, Rex Rabanye and Sol Plaatje.
