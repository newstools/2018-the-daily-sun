“LET nobody father God, who is incompetent, be elected lord
to a position of responsibility.” These were the words of prayer uttered by Chief Justice
Mogoeng Mogoeng, about incompetent officials. Mogoeng’s prayer comes as South Africa will be holding national
elections in 2019. When Mogoeng was appointed by former president Jacob Zuma in
2011, he vowed to be faithful to South Africa, the Constitution and the human
rights entrenched in it.
