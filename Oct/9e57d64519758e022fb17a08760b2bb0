HE was drunk and allegedly poured beer on a policeman! Cops said he also tried to pee on them and punch an officer in the face. JMPD said they will not tolerate this kind of behaviour and the man will be punished. This happened in the Joburg CBD on Saturday when a JMPD officer tried to talk to the man about public drinking. Daily Sun spoke to some of the people who saw the incident. They strongly condemned this kind of behaviour. Musa Nkosi (39) from Joburg said he was disgusted at how people disrespected officers. “This man is being disrespectful by drinking in public. He disrespected the officers further with his barbaric behaviour,” said Musa. Another Joburg resident, Herman Mashaba said: “Criminality begins with these small acts of lawlessness. In time, people grow bolder and venture into bigger crimes. They should be locked up for at least 30 days to reflect on their conduct,” said Herman. Wayne Minnaar, chief superintended of JMPD, said such lawlessness will not be tolerated. “The suspect will now have a lot of time behind bars to regret his actions,” said Minnaar. He added that the man was charged with assault and will appear in court soon.
