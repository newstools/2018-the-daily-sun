MOHUBE Mphehlane (47) says he used to have problems with a sleepy 4-5. It would send women fleeing from his sheets. But then the man discovered Big Job beer . . . Now the women all want a ride with the bomb from Spooktown section in Bekkersdal, Gauteng. Mohube said people might think he was using imbiza to make women follow him. But he said he was simply drinking Big Job and it made his 4-5 rise. He claims his performance in bed is making women cry for more. Mohube said before he started drinking the beer he would even fall asleep before he could bonk a woman: “I could only see women running away from me and they would not tell me why.” One day he went to a local tavern and decided to buy the beer just to taste it. “That day changed my life for good. I noticed the beer had unlocked my 4-5. “It stayed erect for a long time,” he said. “Now other women throw themselves at me, telling me they want to taste what their friends had. I insist on using a condom because I do not want to contract sexually transmitted diseases.” Tavern owner Tsidaks Tuks said Mohube was his biggest customer. “When he comes, he only wants this one beer as it performs miracles for him.” The SunTeam spoke to a representative at Kingsley Beverages SA. He laughed after being told about Mohube’s claim, but said they really appreciated the compliment.
