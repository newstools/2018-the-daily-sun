THE lawyer for the controversial Durban-based pastor, Timothy Omotoso, yesterday applied to have all the charges against him withdrawn. The 59-year-old appeared in the Port Elizabeth High Court alongside Zukiswa Sitho (28) and Lusanda Solani (36) on charges of racketeering, violating the sexual offences act, human trafficking and rape. The senior pastor at the Jesus Dominion International Church has been in prison since his arrest in April last year. He was denied bail twice after it came to light that he was a flight risk. Lusanda and Zukiswa, who are accused of recruiting, grooming and monitoring the movements of girls for the pastor, are out on R2 000 bail each. Omotoso’s lawyer, Advocate Peter Dauberman, said of the 97 charges the three were facing that the charge sheet did not specify the date, time or areas where the alleged offences took place. “I apply to this court to nullify all the charges against the accused. “It is likely that not a single complainant can remember the date and location of their alleged rape,” he told the court. Responding to the defence argument, state prosecutor Nceba Ntelwa said: “The state is mainly depending on the evidence and consultation with the victims, and each and every allegation will show how the accused are linked to the offence.”
