A KHOISAN youth group is reviving their culture by means of music and dance. The group, Gamkhoi Performers, is made up of 11 young people from Hankey, Kouga. The group’s leader, Chief Hester Booysen (77), said: “The group was founded in 1997 with the hope of introducing the Khoisan culture to the community. “Gamtoos Valley is a place where many Khoisan lived hundreds of years ago. We are blessed to be here. “Gamkhoi Performers wants to encourage people to imitate the Khoisan way of life. “One of our other goals is to use Khoisan music and dance routines to encourage the youth to stop doing crime.” Group member Jadrian Prinsloo (18) said: “My peers are doing things that are destroying the community. “We want them to come to our events and sessions so they can learn about the consequences of crime and substance abuse. “We have travelled to Port Elizabeth and Makhanda, where the people appreciated our performances. “The group is appealing to festival organisers and promoters to invite us to their functions.”
