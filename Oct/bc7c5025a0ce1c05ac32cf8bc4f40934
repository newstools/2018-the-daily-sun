OVER 113 employees that worked at the University of South Africa (UNISA) under labour brokers were reportedly unfairly dismissed. The labour brokers brought in new people after the other employees who worked at the institution for 13 months were laid off. EFF Student Command President Mpho Morolane twitted on Monday: “We are not turning back, we told unisa Labour Brokers not to bring their workers. Those who were unfairly dismissed must be the ones reporting back to work. S198A is clear, after 3 months employees are deemed to be permanent.” Now the dismissed employees want to be reinstated.
