IT’S still not clear what triggered an argument between a married couple that led to them being found dead in their house. Nkosinathi Mhlongo (31) was found with three gunshot wounds in a backyard building in KwaNyuswa, west of Durban. His wife, Zanele (23), was found with one wound and a gun lying next to her. It’s believed that the two, who had been married for three years, got into a fight on Saturday night and Zanele shot Nkosinathi three times before turning the gun on herself. A neighbour said the two lived in an outside building in the yard of Nkosinathi’s mum and sister’s house. The neighbour said the mum and sister said they heard gun shots in the early hours of Sunday morning but didn’t realise they were coming from their own yard. “The sister said she went to check on them later in the morning when they didn’t come out. She apparently heard loud music coming from inside the building,” said a neighbour. “They broke down the doors and the couple was found lying dead in the bedroom. “The two often fought but this was unexpected and it really shocked everyone.” Members of the family refused to speak to the SunTeam and said they didn’t want the story published in the newspaper. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident, saying a man and a woman were found dead. “A murder charge and an inquest docket were opened at Hillcrest Police Station for investigation,” he said.
