ENVIRONMENTALIST Richard Magongo (42) is the founder of Timele Greening Project, an initiative that gives recyclers the opportunity to make a living. Richard said the project, which is based in Luphisi Village, Mpumalanga, used to clean rivers, streams, taverns and illegal dumping sites. However, he soon realised his team members could make some money from the waste they collected. Richard said the village they operated in was underdeveloped, which leads to extreme poverty and a high unemployment rate among women and the youth. To make matters worse, the community is also facing challenges such as poaching and illegal dumping. “Litter drifts into Kruger National Park because the area is near the game reserve’s western border. “Schools and ordinary members of the community must engage with each other to put an end to illegal dumping and maintain a clean environment. “I love recycling because we get to make cash while cleaning up at the same time. “Informal waste collectors play an important role in society, as they go to places municipal workers don’t reach.”
