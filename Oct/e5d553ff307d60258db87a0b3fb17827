   Ramaphosa must apply the same consistency with other ministers who continue to serve in his cabinet like Malusi Gigaba, Nomvula Mokonyane, and Bathabile Dlamini. These ministers have demonstrated the same disregard of ethical conduct shown by Nene, and like Nene they too have undermined parliament’s accountability mechanisms. Their continued stay in cabinet sends a message that Ramaphosa is inconsistent and fails to put the interest of South Africans above those of ANC’s big shots.     Highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct must inform anyone who wants to lead South Africa, particularly presiding over the finances of the republic. South Africa must never compromise of this principle, particularly because our state institutions are infested with corruption. Anyone found wanting must be dealt with decisively to draw a solid line against corruption once and for all. - Supplied
