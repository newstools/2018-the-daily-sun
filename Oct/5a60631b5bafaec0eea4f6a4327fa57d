HE BOUGHT the run-down Siyaya taxi and then pimped it up fully. It has red-and-white leather seats with cup holders and a powerful entertainment system and TV screen. His neighbours, tourists and wedding guests absolutely love his taxi! But three traffic cops have a different view! They keep stopping taxi owner Mandla Nnqwazi, saying his taxi is simply too sexy to be on the road! Mandla (43), from Kokosi in Fochville on the West Rand, told Daily Sun his problems started in June this year. Mandla said he travelled all over Gauteng without ever getting stopped. “When these traffic cops first stopped me they told me my taxi looked like a dining-room which they said didn’t comply with the law. “I kept on asking them for some kind of evidence to support what they said, but they wouldn’t stop harassing me.” The problems reached a climax when the same three officers stopped him on 30 September and refused to let him go. Mandla told the SunTeam that after they got into an argument with him, they told him never to drive his vehicle again. He also claims they took his sexy taxi’s licence disc and permit. The frustrated Mandla said the taxi helped him put food on his family’s table. “Those traffic cops are just jealous of my taxi,” he said. “Other traffic cops love it. “Even when I am driving in town, people and their families go crazy over it. “They take pictures and even rent it for family outings.” Merafong’s corporate director Hein Bredenkamp said: “The specification relating to seating capacity, fitment and seats have been changed by the owner from the original factory fitments. “A notice to discontinue the use of the vehicle was issued to the driver and he was told to take the vehicle to a vehicle testing centre to confirm that all the changes made are in line with national regulations.”
