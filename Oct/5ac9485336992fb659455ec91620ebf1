THE fifth edition of the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) promises to be the season of the underdogs. Except for the Soweto giants, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, all the teams who struggled in past seasons have stepped up this time around. They are slowly reaping the rewards of their investments over the past years. The reserve teams of Cape Town City, Free State Stars, SuperSport United and Polokwane City are just some of the contenders that have taken this year’s campaign by storm, showing lot of improvement. Many of them were always among the bottom teams in the PSL reserve league. Five games into the MDC season, all these teams have impressed, with the Citizens currently leading the pack with 12 points. SuperSport are second with 11, and Polokwane and AmaZulu third and fourth respectively with 10 points each. Cape Town City will be hoping to continue where they left off when they visit Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday (10am). This season has been Leopards’ first stint in the MDC. Lidoda Duvha’s reserves are third from bottom of the table with just two points from five encounters. But CT City coach Richard Lovell says Leopards’ poor start counts for nothing because one game can change everything. “We have not achieved anything so we should avoid complacency, because one game can change everything for any team. We have one point more than the second-placed team, so we cannot be comfortable,” said Lovell. “To avoid pressure, we are taking each game as it comes. “I’m proud of the boys, they have done extremely well. But Leopards won’t be an easy side and I’m not reading too much into what they are going through now.” Another fixture this weekend features a bottom-of-the-table battle between Maritzburg United, languishing in last place, against Orlando Pirates, who have not won a single match so far. The game will take place at Orlando Stadium, on Saturday (12pm).
