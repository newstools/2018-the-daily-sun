THERE was visible tension between the family of a rape suspect and his alleged victim’s relatives. A 34-year-old man yesterday appeared in Mount Frere Magistrates Court on charges of rape. The alleged incident occurred at the man’s home in extension 7 of KwaBhaca. According to the alleged victim’s mum, the man kissed, undressed and raped the eight-year-old girl. But the man’s gogo refused to believe her grandson committed the crime. Earlier this month, she visited the mum to hear what happened. When the families saw each other in the court corridor, they gave each other the cold shoulder. “I have nothing to say to them. They have clearly taken his side. I can’t blame them. They are his family. I also have my family behind me,” said the eight-year-old’s mum. The case was postponed to 15 November for a formal bail application.
