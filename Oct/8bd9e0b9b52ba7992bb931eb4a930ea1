WHEELCHAIR superstar Kgothatso “KG” Montjane will join thousands of enthusiastic runners at the fifth edition of the popular Nelson Mandela Remembrance walk and run this year. Montjane, who was recently crowned Gauteng Sports Personality of the Year, will take a break from her favourite sport to wheel her chair along the 10km race route with thousands of participants, starting at the Union Buildings in Tshwane on 9 December. As part of the Mandela centenary celebrations, a 21,1km race has been added to the 10km event and 5km fun walk in the capital. There are plans to add a full marathon (42,2km) to next year’s edition. Some 20 000 runners lined up in the streets of Pretoria last year and organisers are hoping to attract 30 000 this year. Montjane, who is fresh from participation in the US Open, takes a well-earned break from her hectic training to take part in the 10km race to pay tribute to the Madiba. Said the tennis star: “It’s a great honour to take part in this event. It’s all about breaking barriers and going the extra mile with this disability. “I’m hoping to inspire the hopeless and encourage aspiring athletes who dream of breaking into the professional setup. It’s also about promoting a healthy lifestyle and urging disabled athletes and people to stay active.” Gauteng MEC for Sport Faith Mazibuko said she was excited about this year’s event. Mazibuko is also the newly elected ANC Women’s League president in Gauteng. Said Mazibuko: “We are also introducing a half marathon and want to see more men and women have the endurance to take part. We end the year of Mandela centenary celebrations by hosting this walk. We want to inspire young people not to forget this giant.” Runners will pass by Pretoria’s heritage sites and get to enjoy great views of the capital. The 21,1km race starts at 7pm, followed by the 10km race at 8am and the walk at 9am. Runners can enter for the race at www.mandelawalkandrun.com. All proceeds go to the Nelson Mandela Foundation.
