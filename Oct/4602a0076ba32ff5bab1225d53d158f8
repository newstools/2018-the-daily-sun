A COUPLE who overindulged in rum woke up not just with a hangover but also to the realisation that they had bought the hotel they were staying in. According to the Mirror, British newlyweds Gina Lyons (33) and Mark Lee (35) were honeymooning in Sri Lanka in December 2017. On their first night at the hotel, they went down to the beautiful beach with bottles of rum. Gina said: "When we walked into the hotel we saw a group of old Sri Lankan men who were still drunk from the night before, so we started drinking with them. "The hotel looked grotty and very cheap, but it was by the beach and had the 'wooden tree house' feel that we like. "When we were on the beach drinking rum, we were told that the lease was almost up for the hotel. "After finding out that it was £10 000 (about R193 000) a year, myself and Mark thought that it would be a brilliant idea to buy it - because we were so drunk.” Still half drunk the next day, the couple plowed ahead and signed the lease.  It was a big gamble. The couple owed a fortune for their recent wedding – and then Gina found out she was pregnant. Gina said: "When we had paid £8 000 (154 000) of the lease, we found out that we were expecting a baby. "I felt like I was already a bad mother because I felt guilty that I'd wasted all of this money buying a business that might not work. "Even our friends and family think we're idiots and shouldn't have been doing it - we owed a lot of money from the wedding and only lived in a tiny flat, and now we had a baby on the way. "I was plagued with feeling irresponsible, but it was either sink or swim - so we decided we'd have to make it work. "That's when we decided to throw our all into it, both for ourselves and for the baby, and in July we officially became owners of the business." Now extremely sober, Gina and Mark have renamed the hotel “Lucky Beach Tangalle” – and say their business is doing very well.
