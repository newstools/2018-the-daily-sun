Former Miss SA Ntandoyenkosi Kunene-Mthethwa is mourning the loss of her father. The beauty queen, who unlike most celebrities in the entertainment industry, is very open when it comes to her life – sharing many special and the odd sad moments with her adoring fans. The star, who is rumored to be expecting, took to social media a few days ago to reveal she had just lost her father. “Somehow, I always thought you would be around,” Ntando captioned a photo of her parents, “I thought you would be one of those very old people in our family. “I thought you would see my children and, I thought you would be there seeing your last born graduate. “I thought you and mom would be that very old couple that we would continuously celebrate - I thought of all this and God thought of something else.” Ntando, who is married to Gospel star and Pastor Khaya Mthethwa, shared how sad she was at the loss of her father – more so for her mother who has now lost her soulmate. “It is difficult not having you around; it hurts and it’s confusing,” she added, “my heart aches every time I see the love of your life; the lonely hours she now has to live with. “The waking up in the middle of the night and you're not around. The days that are not filled by your voice. “You were our father and her friend, confidant, lover and greatest joy. She has nothing but great things to say about you... I know this is harder on her. “Dad, thank you for loving us and always making your family a priority. I have always loved and adored you.”
