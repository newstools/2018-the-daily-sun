RESIDENTS of Mlungisi kasi in Komani are still in shock following deadly lightning that killed two kids on Sunday. Four kids were struck by lightning on their way home from a neighbouring village on Sunday afternoon. But residents said what shocked them most was that the lightning had not been accompanied by a big thunderstorm, as is usually the case. Resident Siphokazi Gxasheka told Daily Sun they were shocked to hear that children had been struck. “What shocked me even more was that there were only two bolts of lightning. “Even those two flashes were not that strong and there was very little rain.” Kids said the group of kids aged between 11 and 15 had been on their way home just before 2pm on Sunday when they were caught in a storm. “Two girls suffered fatal injuries while two boys are in a critical condition in hospital. “Three of the children are related and one is a friend. Two inquest dockets have been opened for investigation,” said police spokeswoman Captain Namhla Mdleleni. Fundile Feketshane, Enoch Mgijima municipal spokesman, told Daily Sun the mayor yesterday led a delegation to visit the affected families. “The team will to do an assessment to see how we can contribute to the families.”
