THE area is located below the flood line and was clearly marked so people would not build their shacks on the land. Despite all this, some 200 shacks were illegally built. Two months ago, the shack dwellers were given notice to move. And when they wouldn’t move, the Red Ants and EMPD officers did the job for them. Of the 200 shacks in Gabon squatter camp in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, only a few pieces of rubble remained after the action on Thursday. EMPD spokesman Wilfred Kgasago said the shack dwellers received two months’ notice to remove their shacks but they ignored the order. “When the two months lapsed, EMPD officers from the Daveyton precinct and the Red Ants flattened the illegal structures,” said Kgasago. “The barrier was put there for a reason, but the shack dwellers ignored it. “The place is not suitable for human habitation because of the risk of flooding,” he said. Kgasago said they would continue to monitor the area to ensure no shacks were built there again, especially as the rainy season was approaching.
