GATVOL residents have started dumping uncollected rubbish outside a councillor’s office. Residents of Motherwell in Nelson Mandela Bay said they lived in unhealthy conditions as rubbish was dumped all over the streets. Nokubonga Bantwini (41) from NU1 had no choice but to bring the problem to the councillor’s office. “There is a litter collection centre in the area, but it’s always overflowing,” she said. “We’ve been telling our councillor to get the area cleaned, but nothing is happening.” Another resident said they were treated like animals. “Our area is always full of rubbish, which is blown everywhere by the wind,” said the resident. But ward 56 committee member Marx Qandana said residents dumped rubbish illegally. “We’re facing a problem of residents illegally dumping in open spaces. “The municipality collects the rubbish but residents keep dumping it.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said he would get facts from the waste management department.
