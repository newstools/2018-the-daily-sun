TO the outside world, he was a successful surgeon. But in his private life, he was a cruel lover, secretly
sprinkling cocaine on his 4-5 when he poked his girlfriends so they would be so
drugged they would do whatever he wanted. His wicked ways came to a tragic end when one of his
girlfriends died of a cocaine overdose after giving him a blowjob. This is what a court in Magdeburg, Germany is hearing in
the trial of Dr Andreas David Niederbichler (42), according to The Sun.  Niederbichler was having an affair with a woman named
only as Yvonne M (38), who apparently adored him and was prepared to leave her
husband for him. In February, disaster struck when Yvonne became
desperately short of breath after giving Niederbichler a blowjob. She later collapsed and died. An autopsy showed she had suffered a fatal cocaine
overdose. Niederbichler allegedly put cocaine under his foreskin
when he poked other lovers too. The court heard how another of his lovers had twice
crashed her car after unknowingly being drugged up after having sex with Niederbichler. Another woman passed out after poking Niederbichler and
has suffered nervous twitches ever since. He also allegedly secretly sprinkled coke into glasses of
champagne before handing them to his lovers. Niederbichler faces multiple charges, including causing
grievous bodily harm, leading to death. He is yet to respond to the allegations. All his lawyer
has so far said is that the death of Yvonne M had been “unwanted”. The trial continues.
