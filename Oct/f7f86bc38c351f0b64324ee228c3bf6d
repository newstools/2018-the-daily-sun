THIS mum will never forget how she and her daughter were raped just two months apart. The 55-year-old told Daily Sunshe was raped in May 2015 while training to become a sangoma. It happened in Magcakeni Village, near Libode in the Eastern Cape. “It was about 1am and I was asleep. My disabled child was in another room,” she said. “I heard someone breaking into the house, but by the time I woke up, he was inside and grabbed me. “We fought while he tried to undress me. He said if I didn’t give him what he wanted he’d kill me. “My child woke up and came to help me, but he beat her before throwing her out of the house.” He stabbed her in the face before raping her. His wife phoned while he was on top of her. The light from the phone’s screen lit up his face and she recognised him. “After that he ran away and I went out to call for help. I was taken to hospital,” she said. The rapist was arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Her daughter (28) was raped in March two months before her mum’s ordeal. She told Daily Sun: “There was no electricity that night, so I went to the spaza shop to buy a candle. “A man grabbed me and pulled me into his house, where he raped me repeatedly.” The suspect was arrested and released due to lack of evidence. “I always see him roaming around, but my life is ruined.”
