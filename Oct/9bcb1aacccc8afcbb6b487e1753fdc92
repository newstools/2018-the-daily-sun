Black Coffee is finally back home and already on the road with his SA Summer Tour. The tour kick off on Friday in Durban and then moved on to Pretoria’s popular Ayepyep Menlyn. And it seems like the tour has kicked off with a bang with Black Coffee receiving a rather huge surprise gift from a fan. A visual artist by the name of Heath Hlatshwayo presented the DJ with the painting during his set at Ayepyep, leaving Black Coffee stunned. “God Bless you brother this extremely moved me....So good to be celebrated at home,” Black Coffee said. A visibly shocked Black Coffee can be heard saying “un-f***ing-believable” in the video. Check it out below: So this happened in middle of the set last night @ayepyeplifestylemenlyn, work done and presented by this amazing young artist @heath_hlatshwayo God Bless you brother this extremely moved me....So good to be Celebrated at Home ????????????????????
