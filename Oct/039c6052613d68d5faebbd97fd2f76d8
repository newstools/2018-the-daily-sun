A GROUP of women have found a way to keep Sotho traditions alive while also making a living. The owners of the business called Bona wa Sala in Fouriesburg, Free State make traditional pottery mugs, pots, beads, dresses and grass mats. Lesotho-born mum of four Mmamohapi Mosia (60) said she and her friends decided to start a pottery business in 2013 as they were struggling to find jobs. “We didn’t sit and wait for our husbands to provide for us. We decided to use our talent to make traditional attire known as thethana and a host of other products. “We mix pieces of broken tile and put them around clay pots to make them beautiful. We also make pots known as mopotjwana, which is the traditional cup used to pour beer at family gatherings and thanksgiving ceremonies,” she said. Mmamohapi said they charged R120 for small pots and R360 for big ones. Traditional mats and thethana cost R150. She said they aimed to revive traditional ethics and norms among the younger generation as it seemed they had moved to modern lifestyles. “We also encourage young girls and women to attend sewing workshops to develop their talents so they can look after themselves during hard times,” she said.
