IT SEEMS that gang related problems are set to continue in Westbury, Joburg. Just hours after Police Minister Bheki Cele told residents he would send the tactical response unit to clean up their kasi, another shooting took place there. Resident Peter Jeffreys, who was shot at on Tuesday night, said the minister delivered a good speech on Tuesday. “But what happened that night was a different story,” said Jeffreys. He said he was with some friends when an armed man approached him and told him to call his son. After Jeffreys threatened to shoot the man, the gunman returned with three other men. He said the man who shot at him was a gang member and the police knew he had already killed a number of people in the area. Jeffreys said the gunmen claimed that his son belonged to a rival gang. Maryline Smalls (40) said the community was disappointed in Cele. “We are angry with him. “He told us the tactical response unit would be visible from Tuesday,” she said. “A lot of mums have lost children who were not even 21 years old. How long will this go on?” Although the area was peaceful yesterday, residents said they would return to the streets to protest. Police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said the tactical response team was in the area on Tuesday but would be formally deployed today.
