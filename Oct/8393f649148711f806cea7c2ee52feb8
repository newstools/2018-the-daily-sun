PARENTS has been forced to babysit their teenage children after the two were suspended from school almost two months ago. Pupils Havillah Santos (17) and Favour Agbodike (17) were suspended on 5 September after they were filmed having an argument with one of their teachers. “I was in class when one of my friends told me the teacher had been gossiping about me,” said Havillah. “I approached the teacher and she insulted me, so I insulted her back. “When she came close to beating me up, I turned my back on her and walked away.” Havillah said the teacher got angry and pulled out Favour’s braids. “Favour was trying to protect me but she ended up suffering. “The school’s management team didn’t want to hear our explanation. They just suspended us,” said Havillah. Favour said the teacher was aggressive. “She wanted to beat us both us in full view of other pupils,” she said. Havillah’s mum Tshala Santos said she wanted her daughter to go back to school. “Imagine the amount of schoolwork they’ve missed out on. “What’s worse is that they wouldn’t have known that exams were starting if they hadn’t communicated with their peers,” said Tshala. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said the two pupils would be allowed to write their exams. “The law stipulates that no pupil can be barred from writing exams due to pending disciplinary action,” he said. “The matter can’t be discussed until the department obtains a full investigation report with recommendations to determine the way forward.”
