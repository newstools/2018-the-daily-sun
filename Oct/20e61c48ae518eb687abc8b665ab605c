THE festive season is around the corner and tsotsis will be waiting to pounce on unsuspecting shoppers. But the Joburg North police plans to make their lives very difficult. Yesterday, the cluster consisting of Alexandra, Bramley, Sandringham, Midrand and Sandton police stations launched the Buya Mthetho operation for the Christmas season. Police spokesman Captain Steve Malatji said they experienced high levels of crime at this time of year because people visited malls carrying large amounts of cash. “Some of the victims are people followed from banks after withdrawing money,” he said. Malatji said they would make sure the police were everywhere, especially in areas known as hot spots. He didn’t reveal where these spots were because he didn’t want to jeopardise the operation. The police will also use the operation to educate the public about personal safety. The information will be shared through pamphlets, which will be handed out to the public. Malatji said they advised people not to carry large amounts of cash. “People should use their cards to buy items and if they can’t avoid carrying cash, they should always check to see whether they were being followed,” he said. The operation, which will be bigger than the one launched last year, will include the Joburg Metro police, the national traffic police, Gauteng traffic police and community patrollers.
