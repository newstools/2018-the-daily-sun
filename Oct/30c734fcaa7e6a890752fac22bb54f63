MOURNERS attended a night vigil on Saturday to comfort a grieving family. Little did they know more people would die after a gang went on a shooting spree during the vigil in Meqheleng, Ficksburg, in the Free State. A man attending the vigil was shot dead, while a woman asleep in her house was killed by a stray bullet. One of the mourners said: “We were singing hymns when it happened. “Men stormed into the tent and started shooting at us. “They didn’t say what they were looking for. “I hope they are locked up for a long time. “Some people are cruel. “How can they attack a family that has already lost a loved one?” Police spokesman Brigadier Sam Makhele said the gunmen were all wearing blankets. “Three men entered the tent and they started shooting randomly. “Six people were rushed to hospital with multiple gunshot wounds,” said Makhele. He said in another incident in Meqheleng, a group of friends were sitting outside a house when men wearing blankets started shooting. Two men, aged 33 and 38, were fatally wounded, while two others sustained gunshot wounds on their backs. “Neighbours called the police, but on arrival the suspects had already fled towards the Lesotho border. “Cases of murder and attempted murder were opened,” said Makhele.
