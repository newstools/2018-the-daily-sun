 RADIO station Hot 91.9 has fired show host Sasha Martinengo
for calling Julius Malema a ‘Monkey’ on his breakfast show. Hot 91.9FM’s Managing director Lloyd Madurai said the values
of this radio station include a full and unconditional commitment to the South
African Bill of Rights and an all-encompassing respect for all communities
irrespective of their political point of view. Madurai further said: “To this end, the station renews its
commitment to the ICASA Broadcasting Standards and to the national Constitution
and has taken detailed remedial steps to ensure non-recurrence of such
behaviour.” “As such, notwithstanding the presenter’s immediate and
unreserved apology, the station has forthwith elected to remove him from all
involvement with the radio station with immediate effect. Furthermore, the station hereby issues a public apology to
Malema and deeply regrets any adverse inference that the conduct of the
presenter has had,” Madurai said. He added that the station will not tolerate at any stage
such conduct and has dealt with same decisively.
