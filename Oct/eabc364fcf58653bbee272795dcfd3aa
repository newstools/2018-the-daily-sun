Their exchange came about after one of Ncube’s best friends, Dr Musa Mthombeni asked his followers to tag that one person who owed them something. “We all have that one person that owes you something,” the Trending SA presenter said, “from love, relationship, a child, a kiss… Who owes you what?” Ncube replied saying Mthombeni himself owed him a few grands from the time he bought him and his “girls” alcohol. However, the sports presenter was not done there, he proceeded to drag his ex-fiancé Ayanda Thabethe into the mix. “Ayanda Thabethe owes me my cows back,” he added. Thabethe, who moved on with her life and is currently dating rapper and presenter Zulu Mkhathini, simply replied “Uyaphapha.” Many of their followers on social media were amused by the banter between the two ex-lovers.
