A video of a truck that overturned on the N2 highway in Bluewater
Bay, in Port Elizabeth has surfaced on social media. In the video, the truck can be seen lying on the side of the
highway, and multiple other cars parked on the side of the road. Hundreds of people came out of their cars and can be seen looting the
truck. The men and women seem to be looting what looks like
750ml quarts of beer crates.
