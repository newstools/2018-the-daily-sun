TEACHERS at New Look Primary School said they would miss their current grade 7 pupils next year. On Monday, the school in Seshego, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, held a farewell celebration for the pupils who are going to high school in January. The pupils entertained their teachers, parents and fellow pupils with their dancing skills at the event. The best academic performers were awarded with certificates, trophies and medals. Principal Lydia Masekoameng wished the pupils well. She told Daily Sun they had made this year a great one which they would never forget. Masekomeng said the pupils were respectful and disciplined. “We had a good relationship with the pupils throughout the year. They have put our school on the map,” said the principal. She thanked their parents for their support and commitment to their children’s education. She said many pupils lost focus in high school due to peer pressure. “But we believe these pupils will represent us well in the schools they proceed to. “These children have all sorts of talents which need to be nurtured.” Masekoameng also wished the pupils luck with their exams and the future. “With their parent’s support, we believe these pupils will reach their life goals,” she said. Nthara Tladi of the Pietersburg Circuit said the circuit was proud of the school’s performance. “The school has achieved well and represented the circuit in a good manner through the teachers’ commitment to their pupils,” said Tladi.
