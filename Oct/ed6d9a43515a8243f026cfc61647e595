Scores of villagers from Mqhele Village in Elliotdale are now a few thousand rand richer. They are housing more than 130 government officials and they get paid R450 a day per person for a bed and bath. Those who are not housing the officials sell snacks at the sports grounds where the Eastern Cape legislature is sitting. The legislature is in the village to listen to villagers’ grievances. Madala Albert Mfanekiso (62) has seven people staying at his homestead. He said the money had helped a lot: “I used the money to prepare their rooms. It was like we were preparing for Christmas. Our children have temporary jobs from this programme,” said the madala. He said he would use the remaining money to buy some lambs. “We are struggling financially. Many people are unemployed and depend on social grants and farming. We are happy that the government came to us,” Albert said. The legislature’s deputy speaker, Mlibo Qoboshiyane, said: “We love staying in the village, as some of us grew up in villages. “This is the first time we are doing this. “We will make sure it is perfect next time,” he said.
