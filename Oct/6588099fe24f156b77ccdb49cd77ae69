HIGHLY regarded local boxing hero, Zolani “Last Born” Tete, is one step away from realising his childhood dream of being a unified World Boxing Champion. His last important stop was outboxing Russian novice, Mikhail “Misha” Aloyan, at the Ekatering Expo in Russia on Saturday. The sleek southpaw from Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape was defending his World Boxing Organisation (WBO) bantamweight crown. This was his third title defence in a contest that has doubled as one of the quarterfinals in the World Boxing Super Series (WBSS). Tete will face the winner between Ryan Bernett and Nonito Donaire, who are fighting next month, in the semifinals . Bernett, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, will be defending his WBA Super title and the vacant WBC Diamond Crown. Tete’s win against Aloyan was not his celebration alone but Mzansi’s too and local fighters and supporters joined in congratulating the East London-based boxer. If the 30-year-old fighter proceeds to the finals and win it, he will earn a prize purse in the region of R190 million. Top match-maker, Luyanda Kana, said Tete’s stunning performance on foreign soil put Mzansi boxing on a respectable podium place in the world. “It brings back South African boxing’s glory days with fighters such as Welcome Ncita, Vuyani Bhungu, Hawk Makepula and others who kept the SA flag flying high,” said Kana. Kana predicted that Tete would meet Japanese boxing sensation Naoya Inoue in the finals. Tete, reigning South African Boxer of the Year, turned professional in 2006 and has improved his record to 28 wins and three defeats. His dream is to be the first local fighter to be a unified champion, and to achieve that he needs to win the competition. The winner of the mouth-watering series also receives the prestigious Muhammad Ali trophy.
