PUPILS from six school in Mpumalanga received a generous donation of brand new uniforms last week. The uniforms were sponsored by the Thabulukani Home Based Care Centre in Pieterskraal, near Siyabuswa. ANC provincial chief whip James Sikhosana attended the handover ceremony. Sikhosana said the area has well-educated people but it is the hardest hit by poverty. “Some 24 years after the dawn of democracy, hundreds of pupils still don’t have proper school uniform. “Our children are the future of this country. They need to be taken care of,” said Sikhosana. “A school uniform is meant to close the gap between poor and rich kids. “There should be no difference between them. “Children are no supposed to be exposed to poverty. These uniforms will help close that gap.” Sikhosana urged educated young people from the area to go back home and help fight poverty. “This area is not moving forward any yet we have people who were born here who are holding high positions in government and the private sector. “I thank the care centre for their efforts. I will adopt this centre,” he said. Centre manager Anna Mashigo said they come across many challenges when conducting door-to-door visits to households. “We were very moved when we realised that many children don’t even have school uniform. “We made an effort to get them uniforms,” she said. Anna said they went to the Lotto offices and asked for donations. “Lotto officials didn’t hesitate to help,” she said. Anna said they will continue to do their best to uplift the community.
