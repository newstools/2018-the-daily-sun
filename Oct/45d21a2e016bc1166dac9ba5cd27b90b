MOTLATSI Moahi says he loves his wife and wants to give her a decent burial. The 35-year-old denies that he doesn’t want his wife’s body, which has been lying in a mortuary for nine months. Daily Sun published the story on Friday of Keneilwe Koma (31), who died on 5 February in Thabazimbi, Limpopo and has not yet been buried. This was due to a payment dispute between Motlatsi and manager of Gareboe Funeral Services, Johannes Ratshosa. The funeral service is based in Thabazimbi. Johannes, better known as Groot, alleged that Motlatsi disowned the body. The manager refused to release it without a payment of R850 and a further R500 release fee. Motlatsi said he paid R5 000 to a funeral parlour from Lesotho to take Keneilwe’s body back home for burial. “I agreed with ntate Groot that I would pay the R100 daily storage fee for the two weeks that the body was in his mortuary. But I only had R1 500, which was a collection from community members. “Groot refused to take the money because he wanted the full amount, which I didn’t have,” said Motlatsi. “I need help from anyone to bury my wife with dignity, either here or in Lesotho. “I tried to speak to Groot to allow me to pay him in instalments, but he refused. “I’m unemployed and survive by fixing people’s shoes. “My business has been affected because I am stressed,” he said. Motlatsi blames the Thabazimbi Hospital, where his wife died, for the mess. He allegedly told them he’s too poor to bury his wife. He said nurses said they had an arrangement with a local mortuary to help, and they called Groot. He denies dumping Keneilwe and chasing Johannes with a spear. Thabazimbi Hospital CEO Sam Boikanyo referred Daily Sun to the Limpopo Health Department for a comment. The department had not responded to Daily Sun’s enquiry at the time of going to print.
