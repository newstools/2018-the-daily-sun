IT’S been a year since Rhythm City actor Dumi Masilela’s death, but his legacy lives on. His actress widow, Simphiwe Ngema, has revealed that his posthumous album has finally been completed. “It has been hanging over my head since he passed on,” she told Daily Sun. “It’s a huge milestone for me. I had to make sure that it was completed.” She said she was so happy to see this dream that they had both shared coming true. “It was the last thing he was working on. He was passionate about it.” The 10-track album by the talented young man, titled Eternal Crush, will be released on 14 November. “The name was inspired by what we used to call each other. I thought it was a fitting title for the album,” she said. “It was co-produced by Dumi. He also wrote and sang all the songs on the album. It was almost done and only needed some touch ups before he died.” “I’m excited to show people the other side of him that reflects who he really was. “The album is just a small piece of him but it is beautiful. Just like him.”
