AFTER a career that spanned over 20 years, the voice of veteran radio presenter Rowena Baird has gone silent. Rowena succumbed to her battle with colon cancer on Friday. Her radio career started in the mid-1980s when she was part of Radio BOP. She worked at a number of radio stations, including Radio 2000, Channel Africa and Metro FM. She was also a senior presenter at SAfm’s Morning Talk show. SABC spokeswoman Neo Momodu said Rowena left an enduring mark on the broadcasting industry. “The SABC sends its deepest condolences to her family, friends and colleagues at this difficult time.” Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane was shocked by the radio veteran’s death. “Rowena had a deep passion for the liberation of women. She was worried that the stories of women such as Albertina Sisulu weren’t being used effectively to empower and inspire young girls.” EFF national spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi saluted Rowena for her activism and contribution to journalism. He said: “Even during her battle with cancer, she remained hopeful and refused to let anyone pity her. “She became an advocate for everyone who was diagnosed with cancer.”
