Police minister General Bheki Cele has promised to send Amaberete to Westbury on Tuesday. He visited the area on Tuesday after residents demanded to talk to him face to face. Cele promised to sweep gangsters and drug dealers off the streets.  . "We want you to sleep peacefully at night," said Cele. He said that the tactical response and tracking teams, known as Amaberete, will patrol the streets from today (Tuesday). The shutdown in Westbury began after a woman was caught in a crossfire last week Thursday, and was killed. Her 10-year-old daughter was injured during the shoot-out. Cele pleaded with residents to give him 72hrs to arrest the remaining two suspects in this case. "We have already arrested two of them and we are looking for the other two," he said. Residents told him there should be no bail for the perpetrators and he said he would bring justice minister Michael Masutha with him next week. Cele said he is expecting a report on drug lords in the area in 24hrs. He also asked residents to work with cops to identify the drug dealers.
