AN ash heap is all that gogo Jacobeth Masemola (63) has to her name after a fire gutted her shack recently. Jacobeth and her husband John Nkosi (68) lost their shelter in block X of Soshanguve, Tshwane, to vutha. John said he was sitting outside when passersby told him his shack was on fire. The madala said he wasn’t cooking or using electrical appliances when it broke out. “I heard a group of boys saying a shack was on fire, but I didn’t think it was mine because I was sitting in front of it,” he said. “Neighbours rushed to my yard as a cloud of smoke hovered above my shack.” Madala John said he tried to go inside to salvage a few belongings but was stopped by residents. Jacobeth said when the fire broke out, she was told to come home as soon as she could. “Years of hard work were destroyed by the fire,” she told Daily Sun. On Wednesday, the couple slept at a relative’s house in Winterveld. “We’re struggling,” said Jacobeth. “We don’t have money to rebuild our shack. “The little money we had was in the shack when the fire started.” They have nowhere to go, and she said SunReaders were their last hope. “Even one corrugated iron sheet or blanket could help us rebuild our lives,” said Jacobeth.
