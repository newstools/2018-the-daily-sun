SANGOMA Thozama Thabatha is a heartbroken woman. The 42-year-old from KwaZakhele kasi in Port Elizabeth claimed her man has abused her financially, physically and emotionally for the past five years. She told Daily Sun: “I’m traumatised because the man who once loved me has turned my life into a living hell. “I feel humiliated and embarrassed because of what he did to me. “Every time he was drunk I had to suffer abuse. “He would beat me up and strip me naked in front of my neighbours. “He accused me of being a loose woman. “When I had attended gatherings in the area he’d send me rude messages, accusing me of sleeping around. “When I came back home he’d take all my money and buy booze with it.” Now Thozama has encouraged other abused women to seek help. She said reporting abuse didn’t mean you were weak. “I reported him to the police many times. “Last week he was arrested after I opened a case against him. “I want my him to pay for beating me and causing my depression. He even chased me out of our home. “Now I live with my mum.” Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said a man was arrested on Thursday and appeared in court on Friday. “The man faces charges of domestic violence, assault, contravening a protection order and verbal abuse.” He will appear in the New Brighton Magistrates Court again tomorrow. He has been kept in jail.
