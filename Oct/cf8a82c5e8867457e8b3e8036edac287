AS THEY prepare to face Chile in two friendlies, Banyana Banyana coach Desiree Ellis has her fingers crossed that her overseas-based trio of Refiloe Jane, Leandra Smeda and Ode Fulutudile will pack their A-game. Banyana left SA yesterday for the two internationals against their South American counterparts on Saturday at Estadio Sausalito in Vina del Mar and at the Estadio Santa Laura in the capital of Santiago on Tuesday. Ellis flew to South America with 19 players. Jane, Smeda and Fulutudile will fly directly to Chile from Australia, Lithuania and Finland respectively. Jane recently joined Aussie club Canberra United, a move that has boosted her morale as player, Ellis believes. “Going to Australia has given Fifi (Jane) confidence,” she said. “Her game has been raised tremendously. She was outstanding in the Cosafa Cup, scoring a brace in the final, and we hope she carries that form going forward.” Smeda, who made a move overseas in July, became the first SA woman to score in the Uefa Women’s Champions League in August when her side Gintra Universitestas played Finnish champions, Espoo FC Honka. The midfielder is also expected to play a key role alongside Fulutudile for Banyana as they begin their quest of qualifying for their first ever World Cup. Said Ellis: “Leandra plays regularly for Guintra in the Champions League in a different role, which is helping her grow. Ode scores goals, we hope they will take that form to the national team as well.”
