ANOTHER suspect linked to the murder of Heather Peterson from Westbury has been arrested. A joint intelligence driven operation on Sunday led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man. The latest suspect is allegedly linked to the murder of Peterson, as well as to the attempted murder of her niece last month. According to police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele, cops gathered information from the community and traced the suspect to a house in Krugersdorp. The suspect is due to appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court today. Peterson died last month after being caught in the crossfire of a gun battle between alleged drug dealers. Her niece was also shot during the incident, but survived. Makhubele said Livert May and Shaeez Moolgie, who were arrested shortly after the incident, appeared briefly in the Joburg Central Magistrates Court on Tuesday. He said they were expected to apply for bail tomorrow. Makhubele said Moolgie was charged with Peterson’s murder, while May was charged with murder and attempted murder. Peterson’s death led to violent protests in Westbury that saw residents block entrances to the area. They said they were fed up with crime in the area, corrupt cops who allowed it to continue and government’s apparent lack of intervention. Members of the public are encouraged to continue to report crime by calling the police’s CrimeStop number on 08600 10111.
