Superstar rapper Cassper Nyovest is arguably the most successful independent artist in Mzansi. The 27 year old has released no less than 3 platinum selling albums under his own independent label and media company, Family Tree – a feat no other local artist has achieved. Two of Cassper’s albums, Refiloe and Thuto attained gold status on their first day of release. Despite all this success as independent artist, Mufasa as he is also known, seems to be considering partnering with a major label in order to take his brand to the next level. In a series of tweets, Cassper spoke about how major labels “run everything” and how he would have to “share the cake” in order have a number one single on the charts. “I’ll never have a number 1 single in my career unless I share the cake with a major label,” Cassper told a fan who asked why none of his many hits ever dominated charts. “They run the charts, from iTunes to radio. They have all the data, the man power, the connections - maybe it’s time I did. “The next step definitely needs muscle.” Cassper, whose real name is Refiloe Phoolo said he has reached his potential as an Independent artist. “The next step of growth needs a bigger machine and better structure,” he added. “I just think I need to sell a piece of the pie to maximize profit. It’s a business theory. Build it till it’s worth something & sell. If you know you know,” he said in another tweet.
