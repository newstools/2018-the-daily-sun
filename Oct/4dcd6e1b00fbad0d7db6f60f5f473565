COPS will investigate links between the killings and the threat against women who live a Western lifestyle. This is after a former Miss Iraq was warned ‘You’re next’ after another
beauty queen was killed in Baghdad in a suspected murder campaign against
glamorous women. Shimaa Qasim was given the threat after model and social
media star Tara Fares, 22, was shot dead in her Porsche at traffic lights. According to MailOnline, a gunman shot her three times in
broad daylight before escaping on a motorbike ridden by an accomplice. Days after, Qasim, a 23-year-old TV host who was crowned
Miss Iraq in 2015, said she received death threats. Fares had millions of Instagram followers. The publication reports that her murder on September 27
followed the killing of a female activist in the southern city of Basra and the
deaths of two well-known beauty experts. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has ordered intelligence
officers to investigate links between the killings and the threat against women
in the public eye who live a Western lifestyle.
