WORKERS at Enduduzweni Care Centre for the Blind in Umlazi, south of Durban, are living in the dark after eThekwini Municipality switched off their lights. Chairman of the African Enduduzweni Organisation for the Disabled, Themba Shiba said municipal workers cut the power on Monday. He said he suspected Social Development MEC Weziwe Thusi had something to do with the matter. Last year, the department tried to evict the organisation from its building, but Shiba took the matter to court. “The matter has been in court since last year because she failed to file answering affidavits after we opposed the eviction.” Social Development spokeswoman Ncumisa Ndelu said her department was aware of the matter. She said the department provided the centre’s employees with food. Municipal spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said the power was cut to protect workers from a fire hazard. He said the centre was assessed and found to be no longer safe for people to live in.
