THE Social Justice Coalition has opened a criminal case against the City of Cape Town’s social services mayoral committee member, Councillor JP Smith, and safety and security boss Richard Bosman. The coalition accuses them of destroying the shacks and property of poor people in townships without following procedure. Axolile Notywala said lots of people lost their property because of the municipality’s recklessness. He said the City of Cape Town has enforced a record number of demolitions over the past 10 months, more than any other year. “Someone has to account for this because poor people are suffering,” said Notywala. Notywala said their case was about eviction in the Island and Siyahlala squatter camps in Khayelitsha and Siyangena in Philippi, where the municipality demolished shacks and illegally evicted residents without an eviction order. Smith denied any wrongdoing on the part of the metro. “The city did not evict anyone but demolished incomplete and unoccupied illegal structures on its property, which threatened the rights of lawfully awaiting citizens on the housing list.” Western Cape police confirmed that case dockets for illegal eviction, malicious damage to property and theft were reported. .
