DELTA Mokoena and 10 other members of the Better Residents Association appeared in court yesterday for the start of their trial. The 45-year-old and other members of the association, previously known as the Bushbuckridge Residents Association, are facing charges of kidnapping and assault. They were first arrested in 2014 and will appear before magistrate Reginald Cloete in the Mhala Regional Court in Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga. The accused have not been asked to plead yet and the case has been postponed a number of times. They are facing six counts each of kidnapping and assault. In July 2014, it emerged that six victims aged between 17 and 45 were kidnapped after being accused of crimes such as rape and housebreaking. They were arrested for keeping people they claimed were thugs in their own prison in a forest. Cops rescued them from a plantation in Green Valley, outside Acornhoek. During their last appearance, Cloete released them on bail with a warning.
