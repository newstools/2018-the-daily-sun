THE Eastern Cape, one of the poorest provinces of Mzansi, is known for its lack of infrastructure at schools. But for these pupils it is even worse, as they are forced to use the nearest bush because their school has no toilets. The shameful situation is happening at Riverview Junior Secondary School in Ncihana Khasa, near Elliotdale. School governing body chairwoman Nophelo Mti claimed that the school was promised renovations a long time ago, but nothing had come of it. She confirmed that pupils were forced to use the bush, where they also faced the danger of snakes and wild animals. She said parents bought a zinc toilet for the teachers because it was all they could afford. “It is also not convenient, but at least it is better than nothing,” said Mti. The school and SGB tried to remedy the situation themselves and dug a pit for a toilet, but only made it worse when they failed to complete it and left an open sinkhole. Eastern Cape Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said the department did not have enough money to maintain the infrastructure at all schools in the province. “The department receives about R1,4 billion a year and it is not enough. We do our best and identify schools that need swift intervention,” Mtima said.
