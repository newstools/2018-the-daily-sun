THE families of two young men who were kidnapped last month are having sleepless nights. They want their kids to be brought back unharmed. Lehlohonolo Maepa (20) and Mlandu Mtshali (22) were kidnapped by two men at gunpoint on 17 September. The men were driving in a white VW Golf at Mandela Village near KwaMhlanga, where the two live. Lehlohonolo’s father, Peter, said he heard from his son’s friends that he was kidnapped by two men. Peter, who is recovering from a stroke, said his condition had worsened since his son’s kidnap. “I am a sick man and I am pleading with the kidnappers to return those two boys unharmed. “We have tried calling their cellphones but they are off. The matter was reported to the police, who conducted a search but came back empty-handed. “I can no longer take it. I wish I knew the motive behind their kidnapping. “We are praying they come back safely,” he said. Sabina Mtshali told Daily Sun her family had no peace since Mlandu and his friend were abducted. She said the friends were taken from different places. “We are praying day and night for their safe return. “Everyone in the family is keeping faith that nothing bad happens to them. My cousin was not with his friend that night. “After taking Lehlohonolo, the kidnappers forced him to show them where Mlandu was,” she said. KwaMhlanga police spokeswoman Sergeant Zimkhona Mahlangu said a case of kidnapping was opened. Anyone with information should call KwaMhlanga Police Station on 013 947 4045/46/99 or 082 922 9831.
