GLEN Salmon is working behind the scenes at Bidvest Wits, moulding youngsters for Gavin Hunt’s senior team. Salmon is Wits’ MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) coach and has deviated from the goals set by the other 15 clubs chasing MDC glory, cash incentives and the big prize of a 10-day overseas trip. Instead, the 40-year-old former SuperSport United striker has opted to use the MDC to groom talent capable of grabbing opportunities in the senior team one day. “It is never about a top finish for us,” said the lanky ex-striker from Salisbury in Zimbabwe. “Our club is different. This is only about development for us. We give these youngsters two, three years of MDC action – mostly our Under-19s – and in those two years they get to absorb valuable experience to become good players. That is our goal. “It’s not about winning the Diski. We have youth structures, so if I’m going to be scouting to win the Diski Challenge, we are not doing the youth any justice.” Wits’ academy has produced good players in the past and the club has rekindled the whole development idea. Since the inception of the MDC five years ago, the Wits reserves have never been among the top teams. In their run this season, they’ve just registered their second win of the season, a 1-0 win over Cape Town City FC at Bidvest Stadium on Saturday. Stated Salmon: “This is literally our U-18, U-19 Engen squad. They are very young and had a testing start. “We were poor in the last three games but this victory will lift player morale.” The Young Students are ninth in the standings with six points from four matches. Meanwhile, the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium will host the second Diski Festival of the season this weekend with enticing fixtures which include Orlando Pirates up against Baroka FC and Kaizer Chiefs versus Free State Stars.
