A CUNNING conman who targeted female make-up artists
could well be heading back to jail for allegedly stealing their cellphones. According to Punch, Silas Chinedu (26) operated in restaurants
and bars, pretending to be scouting for talented make-up artists to introduce
to his boss who worked with models. One of his alleged victims, Peace Usoro, explained his
con. She said, “Chinedu met with me and asked if I could do
make-up for 15 girls. I told him that I could do it for N3 000 (about R120) each.
He said we should go to the hotel where I was going to do the job. “I went with my apprentice to the hotel; he took us to
the bar and bought us drink. We started discussing the job and he said he
wanted to see my previous jobs. I handed my apprentice’s phone to him first
because I was using my phone to make calls. After he finished going through my
apprentice’s phone, he said the pictures were not enough and I gave him my
phone while he was still holding my apprentice phone. “After I handed my phone to him, he said he wanted to
check if the girls were ready for the make-up. He took the two phones with him
and left us at the bar. When we later asked about him, the hotel denied knowing
him. We were told that he fled through the back door of the hotel.” Another alleged victim, Balikis Olawale, told cops an
almost identical story. Finally Chinedu was bust when one of his victims spotted
him in the Mile 2 area and called the cops. Chinedu had apparently recently been released from prison
after serving a seven month sentence for exactly the same crime. He was hoping to start a better life after doing his
time. “But when there was no work, I started stealing phones
again from April till the day I was arrested,” Chinedu is quoted as saying. He has been remanded in prison until his case returns to
court on 10 December.
