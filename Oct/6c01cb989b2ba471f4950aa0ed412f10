Listeners of Xitsonga Radio Station Munghana – Lonene
recently criticised former Reserve Bank governor Tito Mboweni for speaking English
during an interview. The radio station caters for people who speak Xitsonga and
Mboweni is also a native Xitsonga speaker. But he opted to speak in English during an interview with
the station on a show called Mikondzo ya Tingwazi. This angered a lot of listeners. He was heavily criticised even after he offered apology. The criticism also
followed him to Twitter and Facebook until he expressed a desire to quit
Twitter on 16 September. He tweeted: “When I joined Twitter, it was for sharing,
inform, educate, community, entertainment and friendships. Now it has become
different. It’s abusive and unfriendly. Too many angry people there. Maybe time
to say goodbye.” Since September 16, Mboweni, who is a regular on Twitter, has
posted only once, on September 25. His tweet reads: “A Lynch Mob “A group of people who want to
attack someone who they think has committed a serious crime”. “a Group of
people who attack or try to destroy something or someone “. Cambridge
Dictionary of English.” To fix things, he has
now taken to Facebook to invite all the listeners who criticised him to meet
him at Munyi African Restaurant in Nkowankowa, Tzaneen at 15:30 on Tuesday. Mboweni was born in Tzaneen in Limpopo where the two main
African languages spoken there are Sepedi and Xitsonga.
