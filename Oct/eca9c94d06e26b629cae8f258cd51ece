The nine men were planning to stage a cash-in-transit in Mahikeng, North West, when they were arrested after police received a tip-off. Police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said cops seized six firearms, including an AK-47, handguns and an Uzi. He said police also confiscated a black Jeep, an Audi Q5, a Mercedes ML and a Ford Ranger. “The team acted on information about a group that had gathered at a house in Riviera Park, Mahikeng,” said Naidoo. “While police were arresting six suspects at the house, four more men arrived. They fled and there was a high-speed car chase. During the chase, police fired shots at the suspects’ vehicle, forcing it to a halt. Three suspects were arrested, while the fourth escaped.” Cases of conspiracy to commit robbery, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, and possession of suspected stolen motor vehicles were opened. Naidoo said the firearms would be sent for ballistic testing to establish if they were used to commit other crimes National police commissioner General Khehla Sitole said: “If criminals didn’t know we have penetrated their operations, they most certainly know now.”
