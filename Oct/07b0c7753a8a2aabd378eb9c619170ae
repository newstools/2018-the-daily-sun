PARENTS want the principal to leave! They claim she’s corrupt and unfit to run a school. They said this during a protest outside Ikusasalethu Primary School in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni on Wednesday. Some parents are accusing the principal of selling feeding scheme food. Concerned parent Nomvula Zikode (45) claimed she once bought milk from the school because it was cheaper. “Someone told me there was someone selling milk at a very low price and I jumped at the opportunity. It was clear that the principal knew about it, but did nothing,” claimed Nomvula. Other parents are complaining that there are no security guards at the school. Themba Dlamini (48) claimed: “These kids bring drugs to school. How will they be dealt with if there are no security guards to spot them? Someone needs to intervene.” Ntombenhle Magama (47) said the school was very dirty. “I understand why these kids don’t use the school toilets. “There’s too much filth in those toilets and the principal is doing nothing about it,” said Ntombenhle. The parents said they had sent their complaints to the district office, but no one helped them. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said a service provider had been appointed to maintain the toilets. However, some work was said not to be up to standard and the SGB was managing that issue. “The appointment of patrollers is at an advanced stage. Furthermore, the SGB is considering appointing a security company that will install an alarm and CCTV cameras,” said Mabona.
