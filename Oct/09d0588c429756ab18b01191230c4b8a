Local rapper, Anatii is doing his bit to inspire the next generation of artists, leaders and any other child he can possibly reach. With the 2018 matric exam season having already commenced and the rest of the high school learners to follow soon, Anatii felt that a little inspiration was needed. So, he has made it his mission to visit high schools around the country to not only use his rise to fame to inspire the learners, but also to encourage them to study. The rapper, who just released his already acclaimed second studio album IYEZA, shared a video of one of his high school visits. “FINALS ARE AROUND THE CORNER! I’ve been visiting schools across the country encouraging learners to get together and form study groups and to prepare themselves adequately. They all need as much support, motivation and love we can give them because they are the key to the future,” he captioned the video. Fans and industry peers have applauded Anatii for the incredible role model he is to the youth of Mzansi.
