ALL too often we are our own worst enemies. We can drink and chill with our friends to relax but also guzzle booze and gossip about each other. This negative behaviour causes even the best of friends to fight and break their friendships. These sad stories make the news of Helping Hands a breath of fresh air. The members of this club from Kagiso, near Krugersdorp in Mogale City, are not shy about their love of beer and whisky but they don’t drink to kill the troubles in their heads. Instead, they focus on discussing problems such as the rates and taxes the municipality is charging especially the elderly in their area. Chairman Benjamin Motsamai said: “Our role is not to torch the community buildings but to negotiate with our local municipality to reach a reasonable agreement.” Ronnie Moloelang said: “We focus on stress busting and sharing ideas, not gossip. We appreciate our city so we use our meetings to discuss matters that affect our neighbours and ourselves.” Another member, Jeje Kgole, said: “Discussing depressing problems can get rough without a drink to help you unwind. “We are committed to making sure that we socialise without fighting as the elders did when we were kids. “We don’t drink in front of our kids, keep the doors closed and play classic and modern jazz. But we aren’t hiding from people – we invite others to join in the discussions. We are always looking for new ideas that we can make our kasi a city of diamonds.” “We support our local businesses by buying shisa nyama and booze from them. “All the contributions are from our own pockets.”
