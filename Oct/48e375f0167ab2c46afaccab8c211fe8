FORMER ANC national secretary Sindiso Magaqa’s murder case will be heard in the Pietermaritzburg High Court next year. Magistrate Kulile Mdladlambe announced the move in the Umzimkhulu Magistrates Court yesterday, saying it was based on the seriousness of the case. Sbusiso Ncengwa appeared for the third time in court for the murder. He was arrested in early September and later abandoned his bail application and chose to remain in custody. After his brief appearance yesterday, prosecutor Mbuthokazi April asked for the matter to be postponed to 14 January next year, when the suspect will be given a date to appear in the High Court. Mmagaqa’s brother, Lwazi Magaqa, said the family was happy that the case would be heard in High Court because it meant the state regarded it as serious. “It also means the suspect will get a harsher sentence if found guilty. We will attend the case to the end.” Magaqa, who was a councillor at the time of his death, was coming back from a branch meeting with fellow councillors Jabu Mzizi and Nontsikelelo Mafa. They were sitting in his car at his home at Ibisi when unknown gunmen sprayed them with a hail of bullets. Magaqa later died while the two councillors survived.
