THE HAWKS have arrested two of their police officers on
Monday, for alleged fraud and corruption. A third suspect, who is also a police officer, allegedly avoided
arrest on Sunday. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said the three
suspects, between 35 and 50, are alleged to have misrepresented a businessman
who needed the services of a private investigator. “The victim suspected rampant fraud in his business and the
three allegedly conspired and offered to assist him for a fee. After several months, the victim established that one of the
alleged private investigators was a Hawks member and immediately reported him
to the organisation’s Serious Anti-Corruption Investigation,” Mulaudzi said. He said investigations confirmed that the alleged private
investigator identified was indeed a Hawks member and had two other accomplices
working with him. “The victim had already paid a substantial amount of money
for the services of the three suspects,” Mulaudzi said.
