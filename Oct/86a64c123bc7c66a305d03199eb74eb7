MATRICS were all smiles after writing geography paper 1 yesterday. The SunTeam spoke to several pupils around the country. - Free State: Relebohie Wayisa (19) and her friend Sisipho Stuurman (18) from Sehunelo High in Batho, Mangaung had fun writing geography. Relebohie said: “I’m sure I got 249 out of the total mark of 250.” Sisipho said she only had problems with the part on geomorphology. “We’re both positive that we’ll be smiling when we get our results in January,” said Sisipho. - Cape Town: Matrics from Trafalgar High School in Cape Town said the paper was a walk in the park. Thamsanqa Magasela (18) said: “I know I did well. “Now we’ll just have to wait and see how paper 2 goes.” - KZN: Matrics from Ezithabeni High School in Maphumulo, northern KZN, said the paper was average. Thaduxolo Mchunu (18) said some questions were very easy, but others were tough. “But I prepared well and expect nothing less than 70%.” Nonhle Zulu (18) said: “I also hope to pass with nothing less than 60%.” They said despite living in the rural area where schools had fewer resources, they often studied by candle light and were certain they would pass. - Limpopo: Conny Ngobeni (21) of Moruleng High School in Seshego zone 1, outside Polokwane, found the paper a bit tricky. Pebetsi Chidi (20) told Daily Sun: “Most of the questions we thought would be simple were tricky, but I’m positive I passed.” - North West: John Magodielo (19) and Mogomotsi Matshitse (20) from Itumeleng Secondary School in Ledig, outside Rustenburg said they had a great time writing the paper. Mogomotsi said: “We studied hard and revised the subject for four days. We wrote well and are expecting good symbols.”
