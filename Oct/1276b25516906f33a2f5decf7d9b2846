POPULAR Soweto prophet Angel Bazooka is wanted by the cops. This after he failed to appear in court in connection with two rape cases. He was due to appear in the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto on Friday but didn’t pitch. Soweto police spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza said the prophet failed to comply with his bail conditions. Bazooka, originally from Ghana, led the Kingdom Prayer Ministry Church in Chiawelo, Soweto. In May, he was arrested in the presence of his lawyer for the alleged rape of a 15-year-old girl who is also a member of his church. At the time, the mother told Daily Sun  her daughter was traumatised. She said she went to the church for help because she was a single parent and they survived on piece jobs. Bazooka spent two weeks behind bars and was released on bail. Khoza said another rape case was opened, and since then Bazooka has disappeared. “We were informed that he has skipped the country. We are appealing to members of the public to alert the police to his whereabouts,” said Khoza. On 21 August, Daily Sun published a story after Bazooka posted a video cursing Christian activist Solomon Ashoms for leaking a photo of him lying naked in a bath tub with a glass of what appeared to be wine. In the video, Bazooka told Ashoms to “voetsak” and promised to curse him with a tokoloshe. Community leader Sinethemba Mbuli said: “Residents and other ministries are coming out in support of the victims. We will not back down until he is arrested. “We intend to get a court interdict to stop his church until the law has taken its course. The last video he posted was in Accra. “If he’s innocent, why is he running away?” asked Sinethemba.
