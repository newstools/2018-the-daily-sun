Fashion icon, Coco Chanel once said: “A woman who cuts her hair is about to change her life”. And if that’s the case with Mona Skenjana, then we simply just cannot wait to see what the actress pulls out of the bag. The actress, who currently plays a cameo role on Skeem Saam, debuted a new bald look over the weekend, calling this new phase in her life “Freedom”. Fans have been gushing over the 28-year-old’s new look, calling her a queen. And it seems like Mona herself agreed with them when she captioned one of the photos “my crown”. She’s also called this new phase in her life “bare” and a time of reflection. But this now begs the question, is this really a new phase in her life or is she preparing for a new role that is big enough (and pays her well enough) for her to completely shave her hair off? Only time will tell. #MyCrown? is you A post shared by  Mona Skenjana (@monaskenjana) on Oct 19, 2018 at 8:34am PDT  When you give birth to your best friend ??? #AseAhadi A post shared by  Mona Skenjana (@monaskenjana) on Oct 20, 2018 at 1:42am PDT  #Reflection A post shared by  Mona Skenjana (@monaskenjana) on Oct 20, 2018 at 8:12am PDT  #Bare They will tell you not to love yourself...
