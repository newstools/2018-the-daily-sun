A FORMER researcher in the office of the Tshwane speaker has accused the city of  conducting secret, nighttime interviews after getting rid of him. Daily Sun has seen WhatsApp texts between Mpho Mokhono and a candidate who mysteriously left an interview room at midnight. Several candidates were apparently waiting to be interviewed at that hour. Mpho (50), who was hired in 2013 on a fixed-term contract, said he complained in 2014 after three researchers got permanent jobs. “We were told a mistake had been made and we were supposed to have been made permanent. They told us they’d fix that mistake,” he claimed. Mpho said the city started getting rid of researchers and secretaries in June. “From June to August, 11 researchers were fired,” he said. The posts were later advertised and they reapplied. “In spite of our experience we were not called in for interviews,” he said. He was surprised when a friend was called in for an interview that took place during nighttime. “I was shocked. Why hold interviews in the middle of the night? What are they hiding?” he said. He said more people were still waiting to be interviewed after the friend had left the interview room. “We suspect the interviews ended at about 4am. Something is definitely going on,” he said. Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said Daily Sun’s inquiry was receiving attention but had not replied after seven days.
