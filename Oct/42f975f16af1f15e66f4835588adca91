AN INDIAN girls’ boarding school is in turmoil following
a horror attack on its students by a large crowd of teenage boys and their
parents. According to the Guardian, the girls attend a government
school in the north-eastern state of Bihar. On Saturday night they were playing
together in a sports area. Suddenly a group of teenage boys approached them
making sexually rude remarks. The girls argued back fiercely, and at first the boys
backed off.  But about 20 minutes later
they and some of their parents returned armed with bamboo sticks and iron rods. “They dragged us by our ponytails, assaulted [us] with bamboo
sticks and kicked and punched,” said Gudia, one of 36 girls who were treated in
hospital after the attack. “We were totally unarmed and had nothing to protect us. I
saw many of my friends lying on the ground and crying with pain.” Gudia said the young men were angry “because we had
protested [against] their sexual advances”. The girls admitted to hospital were aged between 10 and
14. Nine suspects have been arrested, all of whom are male
except one. India faces a major crisis with widespread sexual
violence. Resistance to its entrenched “rape culture” has been growing since a
2012 gang rape and murder, reports the Guardian.
