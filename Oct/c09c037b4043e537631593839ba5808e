DON’T kill our cops! This was the call from Eastern Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga. She was speaking to about 200 residents at the end of Police Safety Month at Humansdorp Country Club on Friday. She urged residents of Kouga and Koukamma not to kill cops, and to stop burning police stations and government buildings during protests. Ntshinga said they were there to talk about attacks and murders of cops. “Almost every day police management are horrified by the persistent murders of cops. It takes about two years to train a police member,” she said. “If one officer dies, about 400 people are left without a cop.” Ntshinga urged residents to report corrupt cops. “We can’t work with bad officers among us.” Marry-Anne Mgomezulu of Tsitsikamma said she had written many letters complaining about the lack of cops at their local police stations. “The community of Kareedouw is tired of bad service. At times the station has only three officers.” Safety MEC Weziwe Tikana said: “It’s the responsibility of the residents to report criminals to the cops. “I urge people to stop buying stolen property.”
