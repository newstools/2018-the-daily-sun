THE protesters who torched municipal buildings and a clinic on Tuesday have been released on bail. They appeared briefly in court, where they faced charges of public violence. Unemployed youth in Stutterheim in the Eastern Cape burnt municipal buildings, leaving the town looking like a war zone. They were demanding jobs and accused their mayor of undermining them, of nepotism and complained about a sex-for-jobs scheme operating in the council. Yesterday, the ANC in the province condemned the violence. Provincial secretary Lulama Gcukayitobi urged the community to protest peacefully. Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said they were investigating the shooting that happened during the protest. “Cops were called in and a policeman was assaulted,” he said. “Stones were thrown at a police vehicle and police fired in the direction of the protesters. “One man was shot in the head. He died in hospital in the early hours of Wednesday morning. “A case of murder is being investigated. No arrest has been made.” Police spokeswoman Captain Siphokazi Mawisa said shops remained closed. “The situation is under control at the moment. Police are monitoring the situation,” she said. She said 16 suspects appeared in the Stutterheim Magistrates Court on charges of public violence. “Two juveniles were released on warning,” she said. “They were warned to appear again in court on 8 November.” She said residents were addressed by Rural Development MEC Xolile Nqatha at the Mlungisi Stadium yesterday.
