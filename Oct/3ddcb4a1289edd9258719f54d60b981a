A woman who misrepresented herself as part of Nigerian pastor Tim Omotoso security detail, has been forcefully removed out of the Port Elizabeth High Court by cops. Omotoso, Zukiswa Sitho (28) and Lusanda Solani (36) are in court facing 63 charges, ranging from rape and human trafficking to racketeering. The Commission for the Rights of Religious Communities made a call to women who might have been abused to come forward. The trial commenced on Monday and was adjourned to Tuesday in the Port Elizabeth High Court. Omotoso, the senior pastor at Jesus Dominion International Church, was arrested by the Hawks at Port Elizabeth International Airport in April last year. He was denied bail twice after he was found to be a flight risk, while his co-accused were each released on bail of R2 000. The state alleges Sitho and Solani recruited girls at church crusades around the country and took them to Omotosoâ€™s house in KZN, where they were kept. Some of the girls were aged as young as 13. The commission said they were happy that Omotoso would finally answer for his alleged crimes. On Monday, Omotoso and his co-accused legal counsel Peter Dauberman submitted a notice of objection to charges. Daubermann said there are 63 main counts,but there is no date listed of the offences. He requested for the charges to be striked out. However, the state Prosecutor Nceba Ntelwa said the state has mentioned where the alleged offences occurred and how each accused has contributed to each count. Ntelwa added that the offences committed out by Omotoso and his co-accused happened over many years.
