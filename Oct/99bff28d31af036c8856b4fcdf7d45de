THE four siblings barely survived when their brother came to their house and opened fire on them. But the court only sentenced the evil brother to 10 months behind bars. To add to their horror, he has sent a chilling message from the other side of the prison fence, allegedly threatening to come back and finish them off! The four Mashaba family members survived in May this year after the brother shot them as they watched TV. Sister Sophie Dlamini (54) got a bullet in her right leg, while her brother Magwetja Mashaba (43) was shot in the back and spent two weeks in ICU. Sophie’s ex-husband Simon Dlamini (57) was shot in the thigh. Her other brother was shot twice! After the incident their brother Thabang Mashaba (62) was arrested and sentenced in June to just 10 months in prison. Sophie from Atteridgeville, west of Tshwane, told Daily Sun: “We’re not safe. We can smell death. Our brother shot us and promised to come and finish us off. Please help!” She said before the brother pulled the trigger, he said, “Ningijwayela amasimba” (You’re full of shit). She said they were planning to approach the Human Rights Commission and the Justice Department to help them appeal the sentence. Atteridgeville police spokesman Mapula Rikhotso said: “Cases of being in possession of an unlicensed firearm and attempted murder were opened at the station.”
