THE planned meeting between the South African National Taxi Council and two rival taxi associations from East London didn’t take place after one accused the other of issuing death threats. The Uncedo Taxi Association’s leaders said yesterday they had allegedly received threats from their rivals at Border Alliance Taxi Association. Santaco provincial chairwoman Noluntu Mahashe confirmed the meeting didn’t take place. “The Uncedo leadership said they have seen unknown vehicles around their homes. “On Saturday, the Border Alliance chairman was shot and wounded at his home in East London. We decided to postpone the meeting until further notice. Border Alliance is still angry following the attack on their chairman. Some members are threatening to remove their taxis from taxi ranks,” she said. An executive member from Uncedo confirmed they had received threats of assassination. “Our members, including myself, are in danger of being killed by Border Alliance. Even our leaders in the Mdantsane area have been informed of such assassinations. “On Saturday we were reliably informed there are hitmen going around looking for us. “We have already told police about that.” On Friday, two people were reported to have been injured while vehicles, including a Quantum, were pelted with stones after a taxi fight broke out between the rival associations in the East London CBD. According to drivers, the battle was about taxi routes on Caxton Street in the CBD. Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana said she was worried about the unrest in East London. She said violence wouldn’t benefit any one.
