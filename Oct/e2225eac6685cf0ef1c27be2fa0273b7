FAKE diamonds, uncut diamonds, fake drugs, counterfeit money,
metro police uniform, hijacked cars were some of the merchandise seized by
cops, in Vereeniging. The Gauteng Specific Crimes Investigation Unit and the
National Crime Intelligence Unit reportedly stopped a group of five suspects believed to
be part of a syndicate targeting people who want to sell their goods on-line These suspects were arrested following several complaints of
kidnapping, assault and armed robbery by several victims whom they target
pretending to buy their advertised goods. “The suspects would make an appointment with the victims to
purchase goods. Once they meet, they would then kidnap and trick them by putting
fake diamonds and fake drugs in a bag,” cops said. Following that, other suspects posing as police officers would confront the victims about the diamonds and drugs. They would then demand large sums of money as
a guarantee that they would not be arrested or detained. According to the police, victims who did not cooperate would
then be assaulted and kept hostage. “All the suspects who are Namibian nationals were detained
and are due to appear at the Vanderbiljpark Magistrate court.” Buya Mthetho operations are continuing and police are
appealing to members of the public to report suspicious people and vehicles, on
Crime Stop (08600 10111).
