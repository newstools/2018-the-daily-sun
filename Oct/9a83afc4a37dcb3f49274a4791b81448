A PARENT from Lincoln Heights Secondary School in Newcastle, KZN is angry because it seems his son may have to repeat grade 11 next year. The pupil (18) was allegedly refused permission to write two exam papers last month. The dad said a certain teacher refused to allow him to write the Zulu and maths literacy papers on 18 and 19 September, because the teacher accused him of having sex with another pupil on the school premises. “Without producing proof or calling me into a meeting, the school decided to exclude my son from the exam room for the two subjects,” the parent told Daily Sun. He said what angered him most was school management didn’t follow proper procedure and could have handed down the punishment differently. “The papers they refused to allow him to write were not set by the school but by the district. “It leaves me with many unanswered questions on how the school is going to ensure justice in this matter,” the parent said. Attempts to get comment from the school were unsuccessful as it was closed. The father said he wanted the education department to intervene. KZN Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said: “We have not been informed, probably because of the school holidays. “The district may have been informed but they have not informed us as the department.” He did say that sexual activities are not permitted on school premises. “But equally so, accusing people of something when you cannot provide evidence is dangerous. “We need to get both sides of the story so we can intervene accordingly,” Kwazi said
