NTEBALENG Fingers could not even breast-feed her newborn baby after she gave birth. The baby boy went missing from Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein, Free State on 12 October. The People’s Paper published the story on Friday. Ntebaleng (18) said she gave birth after nine months, but was told that her baby had died because it was extremely premature. She was also told the hospital cremated the baby. But now the provincial health department says her baby’s body is at the hospital mortuary. The family were told to identify the body today and to do DNA tests. Ntebaleng’s sister, Keheletswe Madikgetla (33) said they wished the DNA testing could be done by a private doctor. “The hospital failed us by lying to us. At first the baby was cremated, then suddenly the body is at the hospital mortuary.” Ntebaleng said she could not remember what her baby looked like. Mondli Mvambi, a spokesman for the Free State health department, said the baby had died, but not as a result of negligence by the hospital. “The baby is in the mortuary waiting for the family to take the body,” he said. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sinah Mpakane said a case of kidnapping was changed to an inquest after the body was found.
