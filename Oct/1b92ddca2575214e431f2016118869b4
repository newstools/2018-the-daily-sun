Our favourite queen of the dancefloor, Zodwa Wabantu is hitting back at all the nasty comments about her body on social media. The pro-vosho dancer says even though she doesn’t think she’s gained weight, she’s not going to take trolls laying down. The controversial, Savanna-toting dancer told TshisaLive that in fact, she couldn’t care less. “I saw the comments on my Instagram. People were asking me if I want to lose my career by gaining weight. But I am good. We are good. I am in a good space and at the rate that things are happening, it doesn't look like my luck will run out soon,” she told the publication. She went on to say that she believes in the power of her body to bring home the bacon, and she would never “sabotage” herself by gaining weight. “I have never been thin, so even if I gained weight it wouldn't change a thing. People already know and have spoken about my cellulites and stuff. I won't hide my body because someone thinks I'm fat. Anyway maybe what they should say is I am old and I am maturing. But I know an African woman's body matures like wine so I am not worried about such,” she said to the tabloid.
