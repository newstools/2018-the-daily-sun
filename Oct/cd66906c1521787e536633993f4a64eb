SAMUEL Motlohi works for the local government, but he is not a happy man. The SunTeam met the 47-year-old earlier this week after his video, in which he complained that he last had sex in 2004, went viral. Samuel, from Turflaagte kasi in Mangaung, Free State said he last slept with a woman he met at a tavern. He said since then women have been interested only in spending his money, while not letting him poke them. In the video the cleaner at the Economic Development Department’s offices in Bloemfontein said: “I need help. I do not have a woman. “I last had sex in 2004. I need a good woman.” Samuel, who is better known as Ganda Ganda, met the SunTeam during his lunch break. “The video was shot by my friend in Botshabelo U section two weeks ago. “I regard myself as a virgin after living for 14 years without sex,” Samuel told Daily Sun. “I do not have a woman in my life. I need someone to love and marry. I take my dirty clothes to the laundry and pay for them to be ironed. “I need a woman who is serious about life and who will be ready for marriage. “I am tired of women who just want to spend my money. “I am not sure whether I will still remember how to satisfy a woman in bed. “But I hope the chosen woman will bear with me. “I want to father a child or two before I die.” Dapper El Greco, who posted the video on Facebook, wrote in Sotho: “Can we please help Ganda Ganda here?”
