Dros rape suspect Nicholas Ninow’s life has become more
difficult. After he appeared at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court this
week for allegedly raping a 7 year-old, the Economic Freedom Fighters and Not
In My Name, have called for an extra charge to be added. It was also revealed that he was sacked from his job at a
Vodacom store. The EFF and Not In My Name have called for a charge of
attempted murder to the case of Ninow (27), who is facing four charges
including rape, assault GBH and possession of drugs. The EFF and Not In My name are arguing that adding an
attempted murder charge will be fitting for Ninow. “We’re here to make sure that an attempted murder charge is
added because it’s a child. It’s not rape, it’s murder,” Gauteng EFF chairperson
Mandisa Mashego said. Not in My Name SA’s Themba Masango also echoes Mashego’s
sentiments. Vodacom also announced that Ninow was sacked from his job at
a Vodacom outlet in Orange Grove Mall in Tshwane. “The franchise store owner has confirmed to Vodacom that
Nicholas Ninow’s employment contract was immediately terminated as a result of
the allegations,” Vodacom said on Twitter.
