Legendary Kwaito and House music producer, DJ Cleo says success is no small feat, especially in the entertainment industry. The hit-maker has opened up about his road to success, what it takes and the issue of “entitlement”. Taking to his Twitter page this week, the producer shocked everyone with a picture of 14-year-old him, in his room and working on creating music. “I’ve put in the work since I was 10yrs old...there was no links, SoundCloud, datafilehost or tagging your favourite artist. Nobody owes you a career,” he captioned the photo. After endless replies and inquiries from fans, the DJ went on to answer some questions and share advice on the misconceptions of success. One tweep suggested that Cleo must’ve had help from someone in the industry, but Cleo said there is no such thing. “That help you’re asking for doesn’t exist. That’s why it’s called the music business. #ItsBusiness It’s your talent being exploited for the sake of profit.... A company must make money from you as a product they’re selling.... #help doesn’t pay their salary bill, rent, taxes,” he said. He then addressed that major entitlement issue that seems to plaque up and coming artists in the entertainment industry. “That’s your problem: you’re looking at people as #Celebrities and are very entitled. NOBODY OWES YOU A CAREER. I’m trying to show you the light here but you’re too blind to even see your own eyelashes. Read my earlier reply again... #GoodLuck with that attitude,” he said to one tweep who seemed to be missing the point entirely. Cleo also said that although you need other attributes like a good attitude, respect, and humility, you still need to have the talent because without it you are just “useless”. The DJ and producer reminded everyone that there are no shortcuts and that everything he has accomplished has been because of hard work. I’ve put in the work since I was 10yrs old...there was no links, SoundCloud, datafilehost or tagging your favourite artist.
