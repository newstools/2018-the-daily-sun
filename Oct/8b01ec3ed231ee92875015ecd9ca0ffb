These were the words of a neighbour, who said she knew this marriage would not end well because there was a lot of abuse. The man allegedly shot his wife in Mofolo, Soweto yesterday. “She was only fighting for her marriage. Little did she know she would pay with her life. “The suspect was going to marry another woman who lives two streets away, and his wife was not happy about it.” The neighbour claimed the man was known for his cheating ways, but people were not aware of his abusive nature since he hid it. “He is a well-known businessman and people respected him.
