It has been an interesting couple of weeks for Kwaito’s self-proclaimed godmother, Mshoza. The star, whose real name is Nomasonto Maswanganyi has revealed that she is a thwasa (training to become a sangoma) She took to social media to announce that she had decided to honour her ancestors by answering their calling. “Yes i didn't believe in such but it got to me,” she wrote on Instagram, “yes ngiya thwasa (I’m a thwasa), yes i strongly believe in God by all means i pray. “It doesn't take away the fact that i am Gods creation.” This comes at a time when Mshoza is getting her life back together after a difficult couple of months. Her latest single, Ayina Chorus, is very popular and her reality show, Ayina Script is on its way. It has become common for celebrities to undergo this process of being a tradition healer. Just recently, Kelly Khumalo also decided to answer her calling by undergoing the same process. READ: KELLY KHUMALO IS A THWASA!
