SHE was beaten to a pulp, hacked with a panga and buried in a shallow grave. But Elisa Maphothoma survived. She fought her way out of the ground and crawled to the road. Shocked passersby found Elisa lying on the road, bleeding and covered in dust. She had been hacked on the head and hands with a panga, allegedly by her boyfriend at their home in Settlers Plots near Bela Bela, Limpopo on Sunday morning. The boyfriend allegedly buried her in a shallow grave and left her for dead. But it was not her time to die. She crawled from the shallow grave to the road. Maggie Malapane, one of the people who found Elisa, said they stopped when they saw her lying on the road. “We called the police and an ambulance. She was badly hurt. “She tried to talk but it was hard for her because she was in such pain.” Maggie said the woman only managed to say that her boyfriend wanted to kill her. “She said he wanted to kill her. He just wanted her dead,” Maggie said the woman told her. “When the police came she pointed out where the man was. Cops brought him to the scene. Maggie said the man showed no remorse. “He told us he wanted to kill Elisa because she didn’t want him to build a house for his kids.” Maggie posted Elisa’s pictures on Facebook to let her family know. “We managed to find her family and they took her home,” Maggie told Daily Sun. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the incident. “A case of assault was opened with the police. “The suspect was arrested. He is still in jail as investigations continue,” said Ngoepe.
