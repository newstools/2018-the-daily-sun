Kaizer Chiefs have disclosed that striker Leonardo Castro will miss Tuesday's Premiership clash with Highlands Park at the Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa. Castro has been in good form for the Glamour Boys since his arrival from Mamelodi Sundowns and has netted three goals and managed two assists for the Giovanni Solinas-coached outfit. However, the Colombian is battling with injury and won't be available to face the Lions of the North. The club's official website said: "Chiefs still have Leonardo Castro out with an ankle injury." Meanwhile, Amakhosi provided an update on some other players who have been batting with injuries in recent times including Joseph Molangoane, Erick Mathoho and George Maluleka. The statement continued: "Joseph Molangoane is recovering well from his broken leg. Erick Mathoho is back in full training, while George Maluleka is fully fit again and is available for selection tonight." Chiefs have won three games in a row in the PSL and go into Tuesday's contest with plenty of confidence. A victory for the Soweto giants could see them go top of the standings ahead of current leaders Orlando Pirates. Kick-off is at 19:30.-SPORT24
