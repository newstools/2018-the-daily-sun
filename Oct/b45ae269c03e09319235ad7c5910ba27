JENNIFER Dube is a natural leader. The 18-year-old from Kanana in Orkney, North West, is leading a team of five girls in the fight against crime. She is the North West police junior commissioner while the others are junior deputy commissioners. Her team is made up of Gorolatiro Maimela (15), Palesa Marwane (16), Namatshego Magagane (14), Kgomotso Mokgalodi (16) and Mmabatho Bohelo. They don’t only attend official police events but go out of their way to visit schools affected by drugs, gangsterism and other crimes. Jennifer, who comes from an area with a serious gangsterism problem, and her friends were appointed in August. She told Daily Sun: “Crime is a serious problem in our communities and we need brave people and tough action. “We help the cops to fight crime and stop bullying in schools. We also give cops ideas on how to stop crime.” The girls have even launched a tournament called Sports Against Crime to keep other kids off the streets. Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said the junior commissioner project was launched as a way to invest in young people. “It’s also an empowering tool aimed at providing mentorship while instilling moral and ethical values in the youth,” he told Daily Sun. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane reminded the junior cluster commanders that they are an extension of the provincial office. She said the girls were ambassadors the police and urged commanders to mentor them.
