NOT even a bout of flu will stop Glenrose Xaba from trying to realise her dream of winning the Spar Women’s 10km Grand Prix Series for the first time in four attempts. The gun will go off for the last time in the 2018 Women’s Challenge in Marks Park, Emmarentia, on Sunday at 8am, where hordes of professional and social runners will gather. Residents of suburbs surrounding Marks Park have been warned of temporary road closures between 5am and 11am on Sunday to cater for the Challenge and the 5km fun run. Xaba’s chances are looking great this time around. She tops the leaderboard with 87 points, which is five more than second-placed Rudo Mhonderwa. Rutendo Nyahora is third with 78 points and initial favourite Kesa Molotsane fourth with 73. The middle distance runner from Mpumalanga has been unlucky since the introduction of the Grand Prix format back in 2014, when it still featured a car as first prize, but this could be her year. “It just has to be my own race this time around,” said the soft-spoken Boxer athlete yesterday. “I will not be competing with anyone on Sunday, just running my own race. “I just hope that my flu will be completely cured by Sunday! I had to give up the FNB Joburg City­Run title because of flu. I had to settle for fourth place. I’m just happy my points are back in the bag after the Pietermaritzburg leg of the race.” Xaba (23) finished 11th in 2014, seventh in 2015 and fifth last year. This year she just needs to finish in the top three in the final race to occupy the top spot on the Grand Prix podium. Xaba finished second in the Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban races this year.
