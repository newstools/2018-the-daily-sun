POLICE in Ekurhuleni shut down a drug lab in the area on Wednesday. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said cops were informed that drugs were being made at a house in Esther Park, Sebenza. After police received more information in June, they were led to a house in Cresslawn, Kempton Park. Upon searching the house they came across 12 bags of magnesium stearate – a substance used to make pills – and buckets filled with a drug mixture. Makhubele said the owner of the house told police the chemicals belonged to his brother-in-law. “He took the police to his brother-in-law’s house in Esther Park, Sebenza,” he said. When police searched the house, about 200 mandrax tablets were found. “The men were arrested on charges of manufacturing and dealing in drugs. “The bags of magnesium stearate are worth about R5 million, while the mandrax tablets have an estimated value of R4 million,” said Makhubele. The men will appear in the Kempton Park Magistrates Court soon. Police spokeswoman Constable Carmen Hendricks said the arrests were made on Wednesday in Middelvlei, Randfontein. “The suspects are expected to appear in the Randfontein Magistrates Court soon,” said Hendricks.
