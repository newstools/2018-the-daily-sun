WHEN Amanda Lehman introduced her best friend to her
dad, she had no idea she was being a matchmaker. According to the New York Post, it was plain love at
first sight when Taylor (27) met Kern (52) in 2016 in Phoenix, America where
they both live. “I thought he was very handsome,” Taylor told Caters News
Agency. “When we first met, I worked with Kern’s daughter, she was my best
friend and he was married at the time. I was also in a relationship.” It was a bit awkward as a romance started to blossom
between the two, but over time they all made peace with the unusual situation. Taylor said: “We hit it off. We like the same music and
are both old souls. I fell in love with him for his personality — it made him
so attractive to me. He is fun, outgoing, we both like to party, and he was
charming.” The couple married in May 2017. They have no plans to
have kids together and are opting to live the high life instead. The 25-year age gap does raise some eyebrows, but others
also remark on how striking they are as a couple. Kern, now retired, said: “If it makes you happy and you
click, it’s nobody’s business but yours and if people want to be judgmental,
the hell with them. Leave them in their glass house.”
