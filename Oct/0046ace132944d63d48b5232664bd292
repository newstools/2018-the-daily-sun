CULTURAL expert and virginity tester Nomagugu Ngobese says they won’t allow UN agencies to tell them what to do. Ngobese was reacting to a joint statement by the World Health Organisation, United Nations Women and the United Nations Human Rights Committee released on Wednesday. This was during the World Congress of Gynaecology and Obstetrics in Brazil this week. It stated that virginity testing was medically unnecessary, painful, humiliating and traumatic and should come to an end. Ngobese said they were ready to fight tooth and nail for what they believed was right for their young girls. “We strongly believe this practice helps us fight the challenges faced by our young girls like teenage pregnancies and increasing HIV infections.” She said they still held on to the practice as part of their African roots. Ngobese felt it was disappointing that, while there were many other pressing issues these agencies should be focusing on, they were wasting time on things they shouldn’t be worrying about. “Today we have a high unemployment rate in this country, social ills like crime, while alcohol and drugs are also taking their toll on our communities. That is what these agencies should be focusing on.” Zulu royal household spokesman Prince Thulani Zulu said: “We are far from the UN. “We are going to wait for them to come closer and then we can start putting our energy into defending the practice. “We are saddened that organisations keep calling for this practice to be stopped, while it is something we pride ourselves on as Africans.”
