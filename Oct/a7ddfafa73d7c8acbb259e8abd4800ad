A GROUP of kids turned up at a skhothane party dressed in snazzy outfits on Saturday. But a knife fight soon broke out . . . Their peers felt inferior because they were not wearing luxury brands! Wayne Fortuin (14) was stabbed in the neck during the commotion and died on the spot. His attackers fled the scene and police have launched a manhunt. Wayne’s mum Hlangi (45) said the party was held at a park in Moriting, Ekurhuleni. “It was a platform to show off. I couldn’t shake the feeling something bad was going to happen. “I warned my son not to go, but he insisted.” Hlangi said she told her son to come back home later that day. “He came back but snuck out while I was sleeping.” She said on Sunday morning, one of Wayne’s friends knocked on her door. “I demanded to know where Wayne was,” she said. “When I opened the door, his friends told me he was lying in the park with a stab wound to the neck.” She said she broke down and cried when she got there. “I touched him to feel his pulse and realised he was dead,” said Hlangi. “I didn’t want my son to go there, but he said he just wanted to see what was happening. “He said he was coming back. Now look what’s happened.” Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha said a murder case was opened.
