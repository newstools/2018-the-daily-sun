THE Gxothas are relieved after their daughter Goodness (19) received her ID at last. And it’s all thanks to the SunTeam. The family from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, had battled to get the ID until a friend told them to contact Daily Sun. “I’m happy and grateful to the People’s Paper for helping my child get her ID,” said Goodness’ mum Nora (38). “I was stressed that my daughter couldn’t get her ID. But today I’m a happy mother. Home Affairs has finally issued my daughter’s ID.” Nora collected the ID at Home Affairs’ Cape Town offices. She went there with her husband and their daughter. Goodness was kicked out of college in the Eastern Cape because she didn’t have an ID. After Daily Sun published her story on 4 September, Home Affairs contacted the family. Goodness got her ID last week. “I’ll now be able to do things I couldn’t do when I didn’t have an ID. “I’ll now be able to go back to college,” said Goodness.
