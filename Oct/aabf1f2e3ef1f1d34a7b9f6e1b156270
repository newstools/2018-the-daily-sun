PEOPLE living with albinism are called all sorts of hurtful names such as leswafi and nkawu. They have often said the offensive names stripped them of their humanity. But a group of people have come up with a new name for themselves. They told the SunTeam they would like to be called vanillas. The word vanilla was used a lot during the funeral of Gabisile Shabane and her 15-month-old nephew, Nkosikhona Ngwenya from Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, on Saturday. Gabisile and her nephew were abducted from their home and killed for their body parts in February. Tryphina Nhlapo, who was the MC at the funeral, said they preferred to be called by a name they chose. “We know people find it difficult to call us albinos. “We are black by birth but people still don’t want to accept that,” Tryphina said. “It is better to choose a name that will suit us and make us feel good.” Thato Qweleza of the Beauty by Nature organisation said their skin condition was not a curse or a way to make money. “We live a normal life, even though we are being undermined. “At work we are offered internships instead of real jobs because we are not taken seriously. “Our skin is a gift from God, and our blood is red like everybody else’s,” he said. Masiqoqane Albinism Foundation founder Andile Ngcobo said people living with albinism are also human beings with families. He said: “We also have wives, husbands and children. “Many of us are well educated, but we are still undermined.”
