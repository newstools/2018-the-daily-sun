residents fear the electricity supply box in their kasi will electrocute their kids. They said the box, which is close to the main road in N section of KwaMashu in eThekwini, has been left open for two months. The concerned residents are now pleading with the municipality to seal it. Resident Ntobeko Mchunu (33) said on the day they found the box open, there was a power failure in the area. “It only lasted a day. We haven’t had a power failure since then. “However, we fear a child or even an adult will touch it and get electrocuted. We want it closed urgently,” he said. Another resident Makhosi Ntombela (45) said they had reported the box to the councillor. “Since we reported it, no one has come to fix it. We want it closed as it poses a danger to us and the children in this area.” Makhosi said they suspected the box was opened by izinyoka. “Maybe we will end up paying more for electricity at a later stage because of this,” she said. Councillor Simon Khuboni said he was not aware of the matter. “In another area I was told an electricity box burst into flames but fortunately no one was injured. “I will check on this box. “I want to report on something I’ve seen so I can ensure it gets fixed,” said Khuboni.
