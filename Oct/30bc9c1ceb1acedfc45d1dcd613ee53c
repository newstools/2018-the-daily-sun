The
National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa has expressed support for the
shutdown movement against gangsterism and drugs. NUMSA has
also strongly condemned the police for their alleged brutality and
intimidation! NUMSA’s
Western Cape regional secretary Vuyo Lufele accused the South African Police
Service for failing to stop “gang-propelled violence which has taken dozens of
lives of from working class communities". He has also
called for the nation to support the shutdown Campaign in pursuit of the fight
against gangsterism and drug dealing. “There is
no amount of police repression and intimidation that will discourage the
working class from fighting against these ills,” Lufele said. “Our
communities are under siege from drug dealers and gangs, and it seems to us
that some members of the SAPS are colluding with these thugs against the community. “We want to
remind them that they are members of the working class too and that they have a
duty to fight side by side with us by serving their communities with integrity,
and to the best of their ability.” The
community of Westbury erupted into protests against reported gang-related
killings in Westubry, Gauteng. This was
after a woman was recently shot and killed in an alleged gang-related incident.
