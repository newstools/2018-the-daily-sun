THE Free State police held their excellence awards ceremony at the weekend. But amid applause for the men and women in blue, a woman who is not even a cop wowed guests on Friday night. Phumzile Mofokeng (51) of Zamdela in Sasolburg was awarded the Provincial Commissioner’s Bravery and Patriotic Award after making sure her own son was bust for the murder of his girlfriend. The event was held on Friday night at Kopano Nokeng Lodge, Bloemfontein, and about 30 cops were winners along with Phumzile. She told Daily Sun: “My son (29) was in love with his high school sweetheart. He got a job in Gauteng and took care of the woman’s family. He heard his girlfriend was allegedly in love with a blesser and that made him sad. “In May he came and stole his father’s gun and shot his girlfriend. I reported him at Zamdela cop shop and he was arrested and the gun was found. I was surprised when I got the award, but I am honoured to be chosen.” Provincial police commissioner Major-General Moeketsi Sempe urged cops and communities to continue their good work.
