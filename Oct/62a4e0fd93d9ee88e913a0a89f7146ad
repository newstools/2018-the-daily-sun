Brian Hlongwa has resigned as the Chief Whip of the ANC in
the Gauteng Legislature. In his resignation latter he states that he has requested
the ANC to relieve him from his duties and position as Chief Whip at a date to
be determined by the ANC in Gauteng. “This decision has been informed by my need to resolve the 8-year
long accusations without having the matter aired in the courts of the country. “Furthermore, the ANC is committed to natural justice and my
stay in the legislature would have distracted the movement from its task of
mobilising our people behind a program to unite, renew and create jobs,” said
Hlongwa. He said he was deeply honoured to have served and led the
ANC caucus in the Gauteng Legislature
