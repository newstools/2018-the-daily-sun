A man was killed while attempting to illegally connect
electricity on Ramnath Road in Coniston, in Verulam. Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) spokesperson Prem Balram
said they received a call from a member of public stating that a man had become
unresponsive. He was reportedly attempting to connect electricity from a
light pole across the road. “RUSA Members were dispatched to the scene and upon arrival
found the individual lying in a stream a few meters off the road. An uninsulated live wire was found next to his body. He was
assessed by medics and declared deceased at the scene,” Balram said. It is alleged the deceased was in the process of connecting
electricity from the light pole to a shack at an informal settlement close by,
when he was electrocuted. A trolley belonging to him was located at the scene, it
contained wire and cables similar to the cable that electrocuted him. The deceased's identity has not been established at this
stage.
