A MAN was bust after he was found with suspected stolen goods worth about R2 million. He was bust at his second-hand dealership in Wynberg, north of Joburg, on Friday. The man was arrested after police acted on a tip-off. Police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said cops found various items including jewellery, uncut diamonds and cash. “Police seized, among other items, uncut diamonds, ivory, top brand jewellery pieces including a Rolex watch, cellphones, cash in different currencies and copies of IDs of alleged clients,” she said. “The preliminary estimated value of the goods is between R1,5 and R2 million, pending forensic determination of the value of the uncut diamonds.” Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange warned the public not to be tempted to buy expensive items at unusually low prices. She said they could end being in trouble with the law.
