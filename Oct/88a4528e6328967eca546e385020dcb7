PEOPLE from all walks of life in Tshwane came together in prayer on Sunday. Local organisations, political party members, churches and the community asked God for relief from crime and drugs. Hosted by the DA, the Peace Parade and Prayer was held in Winterveld, Tshwane. The parade of almost 200 people started at Makgatho Garage and finished at Hope Church in Winterveld. DA Gauteng North regional chairman, Councillor Abel Tau, said the area had been devastated by robberies, killings and other criminal activities. He said the fight against crime required all communities to come together irrespective of political or other affiliations. Tau said they were praying for people in the area and also for a peaceful by-election on Wednesday in ward 9. “There have been threats and tensions on the ground. The recent spate of political killings in the country has heightened concerns.” He said it was good to see both DA and ANC by-election candidates among the community members who joined the parade. Councillor candidate Themba Donacabe said the prayer session was a meaningful initiative.
