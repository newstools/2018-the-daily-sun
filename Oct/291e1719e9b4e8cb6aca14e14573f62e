THERE was chaos on Friday when three trains were set alight at the same time. Western Cape firefighters battled to kill the fires in Mbekweni near Paarl, Firgrove near Somerset West and Cape Town. The fires led to all rail services being suspended, leaving commuters across Cape Town stranded. Commuter Mzwamadoda Mcako said: “Whoever is doing this must please stop. You have made your point now. I am the only person working in a family of seven. If I lose my job, what will we eat? Please stop now.” Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said before the fire at Mbekweni Station, there was a shooting incident on the train. “A 16-year-old boy was shot and killed in Mbekweni after he and three others allegedly tried to rob a man on the train to Cape Town from Wellington,” he said. “The train was set alight while it was stationary for a crime scene investigation,” he said. Western Cape Premier Helen Zille said arson damage to trains in the past four months amounted to about R50 million and in the past five years to R210 million. Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services spokesman Theo Layne said the cause of the fire in the city was still undetermined. “Firefighters battled to contain the train fire in the city’s central station as thick black smoke made it difficult to get close. No injuries were recorded,” he said.
