MAMELODI Sundowns reserves team coach David Notoane believes that scoring more goals will play a vital role in their quest to reclaim the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) title. The 2015 champions made the bold statement that they would do whatever it takes to win this year’s title and refuse to be bullied by Golden Arrows, who have dominated the Diski Challenge. In the four seasons of the MDC’s existence, Arrows have won it twice and Sundowns once. The first edition was won by University of Pretoria, who are now campaigning in the National First Division. Notoane’s charges, who have not tasted defeat in the first three games this season, will host Baroka FC at TUT Stadium tomorrow (10am). Said Notoane: “Baroka are always a difficult team. They play on the back foot but we know what we are up against. “We are looking forward to an exciting game that has the potential to see us move up the standings, something we all desire as we aim to reclaim the title.” The experienced Notoane also warned his team to all try to score goals, not only relying on strikers to do the business. He said: “We have been working on getting more numbers in the box, players such as Khayelihle Shozi and Promise Mkhuma must give us more. “The break gave us time to sharpen our attack, hopefully against Baroka we will create more chances and score. “If you look at our last game against Orlando Pirates, we had several chances but could not score. “Scoring is not only the job of strikers, it is a team effort all round –everyone must chip in with goals.”
