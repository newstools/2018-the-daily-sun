ANOTHER big fire in Cape Town over the weekend destroyed 309 shacks, leaving their owners homeless. The fire tore through Overcome Heights squatter camp in Muizenberg on Friday. Resident Zikhona Matiwane (46) said he was at work when the fire broke out and when he got home, everything he owned was in ashes. Backyarder Boniswa Mahlasela said she was stressed because she had heard only landlords would get building materials to rebuild. Sakhumzi Nodada (40) said the fire started at about 5pm. “Imagine coming home after a long week only to find your house has burned down and everything in it is destroyed,” said Sakhumzi. It’s alleged the fire was started by a woman who tried to burn her boyfriend and his nyatsi in his shack. “You can’t do that in a place like this because many people will be affected,” said Sakhumzi. Simphiwe Mashiya (38) said women needed to find other ways to deal with cheating partners. “This is insane because then older people who are single are paying for someone else’s sins.” Residents said they didn’t want the municipality to send tractors to clean the site as it would lead to fights because people wouldn’t know where their shacks were. City of Cape Town Disaster Risk spokeswoman Charlotte Powell said: “Sassa has been activated to provide social relief. Shoprite, Gift of the Givers and the Red Cross Society are also assisting. City services are on the scene to assist with rehabilitation. Informal Settlement Management is issuing starter kits to rebuild dwellings.”
