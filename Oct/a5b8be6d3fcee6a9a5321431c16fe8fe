TWO children were killed following a petrol bomb that was thrown into a house, allegedly by one of the family member’s boyfriend in Mahwelereng in Limpopo. Limpopo MEC for Transport and Community Safety, Makoma Makhurupetje visited the family and discovered that the victims visited the local police station but were allegedly not helped. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said it is alleged that the entire family was asleep when the suspect threw what is believed to be a petrol bomb at the house and it caught fire. The family of eight, aged between three months and seventy years old were trapped inside. “While the rest of the family members were rescued and are now receiving medical treatment, sadly two girls and one adult have since died,” Ngoepe said. “I’m appalled by what has just happen to this family. They did not deserve to be attacked in this manner. This is an apparent case of domestic violence as the perpetrator is known to the family. Whoever did this must be caught and arrested as he does not deserve to live in our society,” Makhurupetje said. She said in case people have got domestic issues to solve with their family members, it is better that they seek counsel from pastors or social workers and not resort to violence of this nature. “The police also must not take lightly reported cases of abuse as victims become vulnerable to attacks as it happened in this case. To avoid this kind of incidence happening, the police must start taking cases of domestic violence seriously” She said
