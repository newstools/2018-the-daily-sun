THE body of a 10-year-old girl, Nonhlanhla Mabena, was found last Friday with two legs and a hand missing. But nobody knew where the body parts were. So residents of Etwatwa, Daveyton in Ekurhuleni, police officials and sniffer dogs went house to house in search of the body parts. Some residents told the lawmen to go into a sangoma’s house as they suspected her. When cops entered the house, the angry residents gathered outside the house, ready to burn it down. But cops found nothing. Sangoma Belina Mhlongo said she was disappointed and hurt by how she was treated by residents. “People are spreading false rumours to ruin my business. I have never used human body parts because my ancestors are against it,” she said. “My God will punish all those who have dragged my name in the mud.” The little girl went missing last Wednesday. Her mum, Josephine, told Daily Sun she sent her to buy headache powder. “She was in school uniform and I told her to rush before her transport came,” said Josephine. She said she became worried as her daughter was taking long. “I went to look for her, but she was nowhere to be found.” She said when she went to open a missing person’s case at the Etwatwa cop shop she was turned away. “I was told to wait 24 hours. I was shocked and hurt,” she said. “Cops finally opened a case after the intervention of CPF members. We believe if cops reacted on time, Nonhlanhla would still be alive. We are disappointed by how they treated us,” she said. The family said they do not have money to bury Nonhlanhla and are appealing to SunReaders to help with donations. Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said: “We are looking for the suspects. The body parts have not been found yet.” He advised the family to lodge a complaint with the station commander.
