THE wrong use of medicine is a problem that puts people at risk every day. SunHealth spoke to Sofia Sirdir, a pharmacist at Discoverers Community Health Centre in Roodeport. She said: “The biggest problem with medicine is a patient who does not take her or his medication as directed.” Advice about medicine Know your medicine: You need to know what your medicine is, what it does, how to take it and what are its expected side effects. You need to take the exact dose of your medicine, at the time prescribed until it is finished or your doctor says it is okay to stop. You need to tell your doctor or pharmacist what other medication or special supplements you are taking, because they may interact with each other in dangerous or deadly ways. Tell your pharmacist if you have allergies, are pregnant or breastfeeding or any other conditions. Store your medicine correctly: Keep your medicine where it needs to be. If the medicine needs to be refrigerated – such as insulin – keep it in the fridge. If it needs to be out of the sunlight or heat, keep it in a dark, cool cupboard. Always keep all medicine out of reach of children. Keep your medicine close: If you need to travel with your medicine, keep in on your body so that it can’t be left in a taxi or stolen. It is wise to plan ahead if you are travelling with your medicine. Speak to your pharmacist: If you are worried about your medicine or are not clear on how to take it, ask your pharmacist.
