MZANSI people always complain that our cops are always ready to accept bribe. But it seems there are still good cops out there. Joburg Safety MMC Michael Sun praised JMPD officers who refused a R25000 bribe and arrested the suspect instead. The suspect, who was driving a blue Polo on the M1 in Joburg, was stopped by the cops. The car was verified to be stolen. The suspect driver claimed that he owns a dealership in Wynberg and does not know the car was stolen. BUT he tried to bribe the JMPD officers, first with R5000 then R25229.50. The Officers refused the bribe and arrested suspect.
