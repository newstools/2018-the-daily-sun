TSHWANE Emergency Services is still looking for a man and a woman in the Apies River. The search started on Sunday morning after the rain stopped. Witnesses Petros du Plessis and Ramona Erasmus said they saw two bodies floating in the river on Saturday. Petros said the incident happened between Capital Park and Hercules. “We came to the river after the heavy rain stopped. “While we were looking at the water, we saw the body of a man in blue overalls being washed away. “A few minutes later, we saw the body of a woman wearing a pink top,” he said. Ramona said there was a lot of rubbish in the river. She said she and her husband were keeping on eye on the bodies when the corpses were suddenly swept away by the flooded river. The SunTeam yesterday saw divers searching the river for the bodies. During the search, a grader removed huge logs from the river to make the divers’ search easier. Tshwane Emergency Services spokesman Johan Pieterse said: “The search for the bodies is still going on but nothing has been found yet.” Pieterse said the northern and western parts of Tshwane were the worst affected by the weekend’s heavy rain.
