“THIS is one the weirdest cases I’ve ever been part of.” These were the words of Tembisa police spokesman, Captain Mofana Masela. Tembisa cops in Ekurhuleni were called to what was reported as a double murder on Monday. Daily Sun published the story yesterday, with the headline: Murder shocks family. But the cops found themselves investigating something even more disturbing than murder. When they arrived at the scene, they found the suspect (25) had slit the woman’s (28) throat and killed her 13-month-old son. Cops also found the dead woman had an eye and finger missing, while her son had an opening on his abdomen and his 4-5 was missing. They questioned the suspect for hours, looking for clues on the missing parts. But he said nothing. Later that day, cops found the woman’s missing finger hidden in her punani. “I don’t know what kind of person would do such a thing,” said Masela. Sangoma Lucy Khoza from Daveyton said this had Satanism written all over it. “People who do satanic rituals usually use people to commit their heartless acts. “They use spells on these people and get them to kill and cut off their family’s body parts,” said Khoza. Masela said they think the suspect was not alone in this and the motive for killings was not yet known. “Cops are investigating two counts of murder and still looking for the missing body parts. The suspect will appear in the Tembisa Magistrates Court soon.”
