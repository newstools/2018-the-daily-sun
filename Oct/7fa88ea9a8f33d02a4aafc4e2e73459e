MATRIC pupils are left with two weeks before they write their final exams. On Sunday, Maphumulo Municipality held a prayer session for matrics at Dlakathi Hall in Maphumulo, northern KZN. Sabelo Xulu (19), a matric pupil from Siphinhlanhla High School, said: “I believe everything will go well. Our teachers went the extra mile to ensure we are ready for the exams. “We’re grateful to the municipality for holding the prayer session. I’m sure we’ll make them proud.” Another pupil, Zamaswazi Dlamini (17) from Maphumulo Combined School, said: “I studied hard since the beginning of the year. I hope to get five distinctions.” Mayor Zibuyisile Khuzwayo-Dlamini and her deputy, Zama Ncalane, led the prayer session. “The aim of the prayer was to calm pupils’ nerves and share ideas on how to ace the exams. We are in the deep rural area with a lack of resources. But we believe the matric pupils are well equipped and ready for their first paper.”
