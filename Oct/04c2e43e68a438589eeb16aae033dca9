Skeem Saam star Innocent Sadiki is getting ready to welcome her baby girl into the world. The actress, who is expecting her second child with husband Pastor Phindu Sadiki, was surprised with a beautiful baby shower by her friends. With bright pink decorations as far as the eye could see, Innocent was dressed in a chic grey dress, later throwing on a pink tutu to fit the theme. “When my #daughters at church surprised me with a #babyshower. I’m #extremely blessed with #genuine and #caring daughters,” she wrote on Instagram. TAKE A LOOK AT THE PICTURES: #fbf when my #daughters at #church #suprised me with a #babyshower .
