TSHEPISO Thakso dreamed of getting married one day. The 26-year-old from Clocolan, Free State told Daily Sun her boyfriend, Abraham Bnamo (36), promised to marry her on one condition: that she gave him a child. “At the time, the only thing I wanted was to get married as I was going to be the first one in my family to get married,” she said. But after giving birth to a baby girl, Tshepiso said the boyfriend dumped her like a hot potato. She said she went along with the idea of having a child because her boyfriend took her to his church and convinced her that he also wanted to get married. “When he asked me to get pregnant, I did not hesitate. But after I gave birth, I was suddenly told to move out of the place we were sharing. He said he wanted a new girlfriend, whom he married on Saturday. “There is not a day that goes by when I don’t have ideas of taking my life. I feel betrayed and lied to,” said Tshepiso. “I would like to advise young women to run as fast as they can if someone promises marriage with conditions.” Abraham said he wanted nothing to do with Tshepiso. “I am going to support my daughter and move on with my life. I promised her marriage but I changed my mind after realising that she was a gold digger. I’m not married yet, but I plan to marry,” he said.
