Durban Kwaito star Mampintsha has revealed that he will be quitting music after the release of his upcoming singles. The former Big Nuz member has been through a lot over the past few months, including fall outs with Afrotainment kingpin DJ Tira and Gqom duo Distruction Boyz. Perhaps his lowest point, he made headlines when he was accused of abusing his fiancé at the time and artist Babes Wodumo. And now, it appears everything has finally taken its toll on the star. He posted a video on social media in which he announced that he will be quitting music because many people in the industry were not happy with him. “I was thinking and looking at the situation right now and I can see that there are some people who are not happy, not fans but people I used to be close with,” he said. “You can see that things are not great, they have posters and they don’t support me. “A smart person can see this, I don’t even want to talk anymore because as you can see I have grown.” He said he has decided to invest all his energy on his last two singles, Phakamisa and a bonus track. Mampintsha, whose real name is Mandla Maphumulo, promised his fans that he would get everything off his chest on these two songs before calling it a day to focus on other things. “Don’t see this as me giving up because it’s not,” he added, “but this should be my last year releasing music. “Maybe these people will be happy if I quit, they have sampled my music but they don’t even greet me when they see me in the streets. “Most of the songs you hear were sampled from me. I would like to thank my fans, I love you, thank you for the support, I will leave you with the queen Babes Wodumo.” He did not, however, rule out the possibility of a comeback in the future.
