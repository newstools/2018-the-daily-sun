THREE taxi owners were gunned down at Nyanga Taxi Rank in Cape Town on Friday afternoon. Nandipha Mgweba (37), a witness, said the shooting happened at about 2pm. “I was waiting for a bus when I heard gunshots. “I ran for my life because I did not want to be caught in the crossfire,” she said. “We all know that innocent people get killed during incidents like these,” she said. A taxi driver said the victims were about to hold a meeting in a shipping container when the shots were fired. “I heard the taxi owners were waiting for the chairman to start the meeting when the gunman walked in and started shooting at them,” said the driver. He said two taxi owners were shot inside the container, while the third was shot as he was fleeing from the scene. “We are still shocked by the incident because the gunman did not shoot everyone. “He chose his victims as if he was there just for them,” he said. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said cops and crime scene investigators combed the taxi rank for clues. “Three men in their 40s were shot and fatally wounded by unidentified men who entered a meeting and fired at them,” said Rwexana. She said a murder case was opened but no arrests had been made. Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the rank and met taxi drivers and owners on Friday. He refused to speak to the media. Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association regional chairman Victor Wiwi said he was shocked by the incident and had no clue what the motive was. The chairman denied allegations of leadership issues at Nyanga Taxi Rank. “We do not know the cause of the incident. We were about to start a meeting when the incident took place,” he said.
