PUPILS were shocked to find their brand new laptops missing two weeks ago. But Thaba Nchu cops arrested two men in Morolong location on Friday with the stolen laptops, worth R80 000. This was after cops received a tip-off about men with eight laptops they were trying to sell. Police spokesman Sergeant Martin Xuma said: “Two men aged 22 and 24 were arrested and charged with possession of suspected stolen property. Eight HP laptops, a Goldstart TV, a DVD player and a decoder were found in their possession. Police went to the given address and found two men. They were arrested after they couldn’t produce proof that they owned the property.” Police found the laptops were allegedly stolen at a local school in Rooifontein Trust two weeks ago, while the TV set, decoder and DVD player were stolen at a house in the same kasi. Investigations are ongoing as 19 laptops were stolen from the school and only eight recovered. The suspects are expected to appear in the Thaba Nchu Magistrates Court soon.
