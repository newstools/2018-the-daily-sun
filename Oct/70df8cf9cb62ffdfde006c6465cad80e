MORE coloured communities have taken to the streets trying to get the government’s attention. Residents of Eldorado Park and Ennerdale in Joburg started burning tyres and blockading roads on Friday and yesterday vowed to continue with a total shutdown this week. The angry residents’ protest follows similar action by residents of Westbury last week, who also complained about drug dealers and gangs infesting their neighbourhoods, as well as a lack of service delivery. The protest organisers yesterday were reportedly planning to hold a meeting to convince residents of surrounding communities to join them. On Friday, big placards were placed on the main road of Ennerdale with the message: “Before, not white enough but now, not black enough! Stop marginalising.” The protesting residents said they wanted President Cyril Ramaphosa and Police Minister Bheki Cele to intervene. Ingrid Jeffreys, an Ennerdale resident, told Daily Sun: “Mzansi belongs to two people, black and white. Anything in between doesn’t exist and this is where the coloured community falls. “We have been marginalised for 24 years. We are experiencing social ills in our kasi like drugs and crime and no one is addressing them.” As tempers flared on Friday, police intervened, firing rubber bullets to disperse an unruly crowd that blocked the busy Golden Highway with stones, rubbish and burning tyres. Eldorado Park residents told Daily Sun they were fighting for recognition. “As the coloured community, we are not recognised. When the government brings development, we are overlooked,” said protest organiser Antony Williams.
