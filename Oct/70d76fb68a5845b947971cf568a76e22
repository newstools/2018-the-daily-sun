The family of the late iconic Motswako rapper Hip Hop Pantsula (HHP) have reportedly gone on record to reject Lerato Sengadi as their Makoti. HHP and Sengadi were separated at the time of his death, however, recent developments suggest they were never even married. According to the Sowetan, the statement released by the Tsambo family spokesperson Nkululeko Ncana, does not recognise Sengadi as the rapper’s widow. "I would like to put this matter to rest and categorically state on record that Ms Sengadi is not, and was never married to Jabulani. She is not his wife!” the statement was quoted having read. "Ms Sengadi is Jabu's ex-fiancée and moved out of his home and his life on her own accord last year. She and her mother were requested to desist from spreading this falsehood. "As things stand, the Tsambo family reserves its rights should Ms Sengadi continue to peddle these falsehoods." Although they were living apart at the time of his passing, HHP and Sengadi were cordial with one another. “There was no bad blood between them. Their separation was amicable,” a close friend of the pair told Daily Sun HHP, real name Jabulani Tsambo, died on Wednesday, 24 October after allegedly committing suicide following a battle with depression.
