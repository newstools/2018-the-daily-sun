HE’D been out all day drinking. When he got home drunk and demanded sex from his wife,
she refused. So Palamulani Chika from Dzama village in central Malawi
went to a tobacco shed and hanged himself, according to Nyasa Times. Cop Gladson M’bumpha said Palamulani had gone out last
Friday morning to a local drinking joint and returned home around 11.30am for
lunch. His wife, Joice Palamulani (60), dished up his food.
After he’d satisfied himself, he’d returned to the tavern for a few more
rounds. Much later, he returned home, very worse for wear. He and
Joice went to bed but Joice had no interest in poking with him. When Palamulani
tried to beat her into it, Joice fled to her sister’s house for the night. She was still at her sister’s house when a villager came
with the news that Palamulani had been found dead, hanging in the tobacco shed. Cops said no foul play is suspected.
