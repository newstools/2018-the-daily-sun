THE unruly youths of Stutterheim near King William’s Town brought the CBD to a standstill. They burnt tyres, threw bricks and torched buildings during a march to the municipal offices. They said the municipality was failing to give interns full-time jobs and that nepotism, corruption and sex-for-jobs schemes were rife. Xolisa Tom (27), who was allegedly shot by police during the protest on Tuesday, died in hospital. Anathi Nyoka, Amahlathi municipal spokeswoman, said the youths had previously staged a march on 25 September, during which they handed over a petition. Nyoka told the People’s Paper: “The speaker and mayor responded the same day to some of the issues with a number of resolutions. “The municipality was still in the process of trying to resolve some of the outstanding issues when the youth arrived at the municipal offices yesterday with burning tyres.” Spokeswoman Captain Siphokazi Mawisa said police vehicles were pelted with stones. Mawisa confirmed that one person died during the violence. “Police arrested 18 suspects on charges of public violence and malicious damage to property,” she said. “They’ll appear in the Stutterheim Magistrates Court soon.”
