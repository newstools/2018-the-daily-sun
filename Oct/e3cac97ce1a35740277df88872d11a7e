ONE community is left only with the smell of a failed government. And it smells like kak! Like hundreds of other kasis, residents of Nthabiseng Village in Morebeng outside Polokwane, Limpopo are also choking from the sickening smell of raw shit seeping up from blocked pipes in their village. The angry residents told Daily Sun the pipes have been blocked for more than 10 years, and they have never been fixed. They said they had reported the matter to their local municipality many times but their complaints fell on deaf ears. Resident Piet Motshosi said the stink from the sewers affected their health. He said the pipes got blocked because of the water shortage in their village. “We have had enough of our municipality’s empty promises,” he said. Another resident, Shadrack Molokomme, urged the municipality to act fast. Capricorn municipal spokesman Moffat Senyatsi promised that technicians would attend to the matter soon. “This will be part of 10 blockages that were reported and cleared in the past few months in the same area,” said Senyatsi. He said in one case, technicians found that in one household a toilet had been built right on top of the main pipeline, which restricted movement in the pipeline and caused the spillage onto the streets. “We urge our residents to stop flushing stones, towels, nappies, tampons, wipes and other materials. “These products cannot be broken down in the pipelines like toilet paper.”
