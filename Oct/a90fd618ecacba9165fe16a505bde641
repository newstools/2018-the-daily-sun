House music producer and DJ, Prince Kaybee has announced the release date for his untitled, third studio album. Taking to social media last week, Kaybee let fans know that the wait will come to an end in February 2019. He acknowledged that February is still quite far away and so to keep the momentum building, he will be sharing regular snippets of the songs as they become completed. “I will be sharing snippets like this of each and every song on the album until the release date, it’s like a mini listening session for you guys,” he told fans. The first of these snippets is a song titled Fetch Your Life featuring East-London born singer and songwriter, Msaki. The song is quintessentially, Prince Kaybee, an up-tempo beat with an outdoor, summer feel to it, the perfect soundtrack for a road trip to the beach or an afternoon on a rooftop overlooking the city with some friends. Kaybee, who just completed a “life-changing” set at Macufe this past weekend, released the much-awaited video for Banomoya, featuring Busiswa and TNS last week. The song will feature on his next album.
