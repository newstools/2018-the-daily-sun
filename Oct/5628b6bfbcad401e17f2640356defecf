  LIMPOPO cops have arrested two men for smuggling illegal creams at the Groblesburg Port of Entry in the Tom Burke, outside Lephalale. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the suspects were traveling in a truck, which entered the border post intending to cross from Botswana to South Africa carrying 32 bags of natural steatite. He said the driver was instructed and referred to the ramp inspection area in order to conduct an inspection of the load but the driver drove away. "The truck was located and retreated to the search point and searched. During this search process, boxes of illicit creams were found concealed inside the bags and confiscated. The driver and his crew were immediately arrested,” Ngoepe said. “The confiscated illicit creams are as follows: 64512 tubes of betasol creams, 7200 tubes of betasol lotion, 2400 tubes of epiderm lotion, 5200 containers of extra clear lotion and 92000 tables of apetito (weight loss tablets),” Ngoepe said. He added that the estimated value of the creams is over R3 million. The suspects will appear before the Phalala Magistrate Court in Lephalale soon.
