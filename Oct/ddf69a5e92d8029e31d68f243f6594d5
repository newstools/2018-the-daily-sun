THE public works department wants the construction industry to use green energy to reduce carbon emissions. The department launched the green building uPolicy in Cape Town on Wednesday. Speaking on behalf of Minister Thulas Nxesi, programme manager Nkosana Kubheka said the construction sector was one of the industries that used fossil fuels. This had to end because the fuels passed a lot of carbon emissions into the environment. Kubheka said construction companies should put the policy to good use. “As the industry, we must make sure we play our role in cutting down carbon emissions.” The department paid tribute to late environmental affairs minister Edna Molewa, who died last week. Kubheka said Molewa was one of the people who championed the policy through her department. He said as the department was the largest property owner, it would lead the programme to implement the policy. “Public works is responsible for more than 90 000 facilities across the country,” said Kubheka. “It’s important that we play our part and change the way we do business and use clean energy.” Green Building Council in South Africa CEO Dorah Modise said the council welcomed the policy document. “We will study it and hold the minister accountable for implementation. “Everyone you need to implement this policy is in this room today,” she said. Nomthandazo Ntuli, who owns a construction company, said: “We have to embrace what government has brought forward.”
