On THURSDAY, a new block of flats was demolished in Zimbane Village, Mthatha, Eastern Cape. This was after the owner was accused of building on land belonging to the people of the village without consulting them. Sibulele Mnqotho, chairman of the Zimbane Land Forum, said the land belonged to a group of claimants and not any individual. “The flat owner was disrespectful. He said he couldn’t talk to us when we tried to stop him from building,” he said. “We know of certain people selling land in our area and that’s illegal. People should stop buying land illegally.” Mnqotho said they took the matter to court after the owner of the flats refused to listen to residents. “We have a court order dated 2 August. It states very clearly that the land belongs to the Zimbane Land Forum. It’s sad we had to go this far, but we warned the owner and he ignored us. “We had reserved the land for development that would improve the lives of residents,” said Mnqotho. “If a person wants the land for business purpose, they should talk to land claimants first and come to an agreement. We also need to know if the project will benefit the community.” “They should write to the regional land claims commissioner to notify them of their agreement with claimants.” The flat owner could not be reached for comment.
