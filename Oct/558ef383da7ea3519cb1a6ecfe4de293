WHEN he came into the scene, he met a beautiful woman by the name of Pearl and they instantly hit it off, but there was one dilemma – their fathers David Genaro and Suffocate Ndlovu don’t see eye-to-eye, in fact they are sworn enemies. So, they did everything in their power to keep Pearl and Mzi apart. Sun Buzz caught up with Rhythm City’s heartthrob Jesse Suntele to chat about his on-screen dilemma that sees him stuck between two equally beautiful women, who happen to be friends. “Mzi has options and he is trying to way them to see which one he wants, but one thing’s for sure, one woman will walk away emptied handed and with a broken. On the other hand, Mzi and Reneilwe have so much in common, he likes her and she likes him, but there’s Pearl with whom he has unfinished business, but they can’t be together because of families are at odds with each other,” the hunk said. He said his current predicament resonates with viewers of the show, because some of them go through the same dilemma.  He said: “Mzi’s situation is something that people go through on a daily basis, so I think it’s important that it is being highlighted and people are responding well to the storyline. The 25-year-old star told Sun Buzz that since joining the etv soapie, he’s been having a great time. “I’m enjoying playing Mzi and what I like about him is that he is educated and dependable, people can always count on him and that’s always a good thing,” he said. He added that there’s more drama to come in his love triangle. Catch Jesse as Mzi every weekday at 19:00 on etv.
