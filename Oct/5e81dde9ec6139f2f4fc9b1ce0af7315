The Autumn/Winter ‘19 installment of SA Fashion Week (SAFW) kicked off in Johannesburg last night. Now in its 21st year of existence, SAFW gives local designers the ultimate platform to show off their work to investors, editors, buyers, stylists, celebrities and other high-profile clients all gathered under one roof. Given the auspicious nature of the 21st anniversary, SAFW A/W ’19 kicked off with a bang last night at the famous Cruz Vodka opening party. SAFW has vowed to take on a particularly festive tone with this installment of fashion week and boy did they do it. The who’s who of Mzansi’s entertainment scene showed up looking nothing less than fabulous at last night’s opening party held at The Marc in Sandton, Joburg. In attendance were stars such as Mathew and Gena Knowles in Gert-Johan Coetzee, Lunga Shabalala in Ephymol, Khanya Mkangisa in Keys Fashion By Ryan Keys, K Naomi in Brides Palace, Moozlie in Keys Fashion By Ryan Keys, Phindile Gwala in Precious Lulu, AKA, Gugu Khathi, Lasizwe, DreamTeam in House of Saint Luke and S'phesihle Vazi to name just a few. SAFW will showcase the works of 56 designers who will debut their Autumn/Winter collections this week. In addition to the runway shows, SAFW has put together a ’21 YEARS OF FASHION’ book as well as an exhibition to take fashion lovers on a magical journey through the evolution of fashion design in South Africa. The exhibition will feature 71 garments tracing back to 1997 and the book will be available in physical and digital copies. Check out all the pictures from last night below.
