DRUG use among pupils is a huge problem across Mzansi. This prompted circuit 1306 of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa to hold a prayer service on Friday. It was held at Lutoli Junior Secondary School in Sibangweni Village, Mthatha. Reverend Simphiwe Mtolo said he was a former pupil of the school. He said he wanted to support it as the pupils there had a drug problem. “I saw the need to ask for God’s intervention in the school. “We want to fight all bad spirits and habits among pupils. As the school is situated in a rural area, we wanted to bring them some of their necessities such as pens, shoe polish and toothpaste.” School head of department Nomfundiso Nomabunga said they appreciated the support. “We’re grateful for what the church has done for the school. “We are one of the most disadvantaged schools in the area and we have a challenge with drug use by pupils,” she said. Nomabunga said the school always urged pupils to respect, behave and to do well academically. Grade 9 pupil Indiphile Mpayipheli thanked the church for visiting the school. “We are grateful you thought of us and took time to pray for us. “We promise we will be on our best behaviour,” she said.
