Legendary Kwaito and House music producer, Oskido has hit yet another major milestone. His 2017 album, 50 Degrees has officially been certified as a Double Platinum-selling album. This means that the album has sold over 60 000 copies since its release. The Recording Industry of South Africa (RiSA) certifies an album has having gone platinum when it sells 30 000 copies, and since Oskido has doubled those numbers, he has been awarded a Double Platinum certification. He is now in the running for the Multi-Platinum certification. 50 Degrees was produced by Oskido through his record label, Kalawa Jazmee Records, and distributed by Universal Music. The CEO of RiSA, Nhlanhla Sibisi yesterday officially awarded Oskido, real name Oscar Bonginkosi Mdlongwa, with the Double Platinum certification and plaque. The album has done incredibly well on the club scene as well as national radio charts. But of course, Oskido is no stranger to astronomical levels of success. The producer, club and radio DJ, and entrepreneur has sold millions of records in his 29-year career. He is allegedly worth over R28 million. With RISA Ceo Nhlanhla Sibisi and director of Universal Music Group digital Pino, if its not certified by RISA it aint real. #RealRecogniseReal Finally got the plague ????
