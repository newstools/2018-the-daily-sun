EVEN though she is happy with the new house, she still wishes she had buried her son. Nombeko Thole (49) from Jerusalem in Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun that she would have liked to bury her son, Richard (5) in the Eastern Cape. That’s where most of her relatives are buried. But she couldn’t because her son’s body was never found. “I am happy and sad at the same time. I know this house belongs to Richard. I got the house because of him,” said Nombeko. She was speaking outside her new house, which was given to her by the City of Ekurhuleni. It was the fulfilment of a promise they made her after the tragic loss of her son a year ago. The two-bedroomed house in Chief Albert Luthuli near Daveyton was handed over by Human Settlements MMC Lesiba Mpya yesterday. Nombeko said she will be living with her 26-year-old daughter and her partner in the house. Richard fell into a mine shaft in February last year, and attempts to get his body were not successful. Nombeko said she would like to have a small ceremony near the shaft where her son fell. She believes that will help her find closure. Mpya said they were fulfilling a promise made by the Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina after he saw the conditions the family lived in. “We took the family through the rigorous process of verification and saw that they had initially applied for an RDP. We assisted the family by speeding up the application,” said Mpya.
