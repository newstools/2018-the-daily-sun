With popular SABC 3 talk show, Real Talk with Azania Mosaka being scrapped by the channel, poet and author, Ntsiki Mazwai is expressing her interest in being a talk show host. According to the controversial poet, she was just made for current affairs and talk television. In fact, she says it is as clear as day, for everyone to see, that she belongs on a talk show. “For the past two years this channel has been wanting me to do a reality show. I don't understand because is it not obvious to everyone that I should be hosting a current affairs talk show? Like is it not obvious?” said Ntsiki. Ntsiki says that she was born for this role because she clearly is “a platform for people to speak and express themselves” but instead, people are trying to turn her into “a Kim Kardashian”. “I raise social issues every day and get people talking and you can't tell that I'm a talk show host? You wanna Kim Kardashian me?” she rambled on. She also revealed that when she turned down the reality show proposal, she was labelled a diva and “difficult” to work with. “It's just that I refused to dumb myself down for fame......now they say I was difficult. Sometimes I'm seen as a diva when I simply can't engage something shallow.....like I have a story to tell,” she said.
