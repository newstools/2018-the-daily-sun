TV presenter, Masego ‘Maps’ Maponyane  and Rugby superstar, Bryan Habana have experienced what it is like to be in a wheelchair. The local heroes attended the 2018 Laureus Sport for Good Summit in Paris, France this week. The Summit is an annual event hosted by the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, a charitable organisation that supports many projects across the world. The foundation enacts change by using sport to influence positive social change, from religious intolerance in Ireland, to gangsterism in the USA and poverty in India. As part of the global delegation, Maps and Bryan took part in the discussions and activities of the summit. One of the activities included playing a round of Basketball in a wheelchair. This was an experience that Maps describes as “eye-opening”. “Playing a game of wheelchair basketball was definitely a lot harder than it seemed, especially with the most competitive person in the world, a menacing Bryan Habana breathing down your neck and planning your demise. An eye opening experience,” he said. Incredible day at the @LaureusSport For Good Global Summit in Paris, focusing on the importance of inclusion across all sporting codes.
