FOR most grade 12 girls and boys, the matric dance is all about glitz and glamour and every pupil looks forward to the event. But not everyone can afford to go shopping for dresses and suits for the special occasion. Ikeketsetseng Secondary School in Sasolburg, Free State decided that everyone would attend the matric farewell wearing their school uniforms. Last Friday they held a matric dance for all the grade 12s in Sasolburg. This was the idea of the principal, Eric Sedi. “Over the years many pupils couldn’t attend the matric farewell but would come watch their classmates walking down the red carpet. It pained me to see that because I know most of the pupils didn’t have money for nice dresses and suits.” He said he consulted the event committee and suggested that pupils wear their school uniforms to the matric dance this year. “When we told the pupils, most of them were happy about the idea. Their parents supported it too,” he said. The principal said they continued to organise a glamorous and memorable event. “We spoke to a local catering company who hired a venue and decorated it for us. The pupils might have thought they’d have a boring evening, but when they arrived they were happy to see the smart venue,” he said. He said they were happy with all the compliments they had received and hoped other schools would do the same.
