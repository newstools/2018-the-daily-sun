THE commemoration of Mama Albertina Sisulu’s 100th birthday was held at the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto yesterday. Many of the ANC’s top brass, including Bathabile Dlamini, Jessie Duarte, Baleka Mbete, Nomvula Mokonyane, as well as Gauteng Premier David Makhura, attended. Jeff Radebe gave the official address. The Sisulu family, including Max Sisulu were also at the event. Mama Albertina was born on 21 October 1918 in Camama in Eastern Cape and passed away on 2 June 2011. She qualified as a nurse in 1944 and married Walter Sisulu that same year. Many regard her as the true mother of the nation. There was a wreath-laying ceremony at the graveyard followed by a church service at the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto. During his sermon, Archbishop Dr Thabo Cecil Makgoba said that Mama Sisulu became a leader through her work in the community. Radebe said Mama Sisulu was not just a wife to a leader. “She spent her life fighting the tyranny of apartheid,” he said. He said people should look inward and find the Mama Sisulu in themselves. After the church service there was an unveiling of a plaque by Radebe at the Holy Cross Creche, which was renovated by the Sisulu family.
