CONDOLENCES continue to pour in for ANC stalwart Moss Chikane, who died late on Wednesday following a period of illness. Family spokesman Chikane Chikane said the retired diplomat had been unwell for some time and had been in and out of hospital. “He was 69 years old,” he said. Mzansi mourned the passing of Chikane on social media. Edgar L Ngubeni: “My heartfelt condolences to the Chikane family and friends on the passing of Chikane, who was once my neighbour in Mamelodi.” Abel B Mtshweni: “Indeed this is sad news. We’re poorer without him. Comrade Bra Moss Chikane. May his revolutionary soul rest in eternal peace.” Born in Groblersdal in Limpopo as the first born in a family of nine, Chikana played a prominent role in the liberation struggle and was one of the key leaders of the United Democratic Front. In 1988 he was convicted of treason with Popo Molefe, Terror Lekota and Tom Manthata. Moss was elected as an MP in 1994. He leaves behind five sons and a daughter, three brothers and four sisters. According to the family, funeral arrangements will be announced in due course.
