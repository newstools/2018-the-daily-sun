BEN Phiri’s dream has always been to study IT, but he has lost all hope. The 23-year-old from Ivory Park in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, saidhis life became a living hell in 2012. His mum Sibongile left home without helping him get a birth certificate or ID. Ben said he lived with his mum and stepfather, but things turned sour in 2006 when his stepfather became abusive. Six years ago Ben came home from school to find his mum had packed everything in the house and left. Neighbours who had seen a bakkie loading his mum’s things said she didn’t say goodbye. “I knew my mum loved me and she wasn’t going to leave me behind unless she had no choice,” he said. “Whenever I go to Home Affairs to apply for an ID, they tell me to bring my mum or her documents. I wrote matric in 2014 using a temporary ID.” Ben said no one knew where his mum was. He had tried to reach out to her family but didn’t know his relatives. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said Ben should go to their nearest offices for assistance. “We will then investigate to determine the authenticity of his claims,” he said.
