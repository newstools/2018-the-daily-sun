WOMEN in this community feel as though they’re under attack. A gang of evil rapists are targeting girls dressed in church uniforms. Girls from Actonville in Ekurhuleni said they are afraid to go to church to pray because they are being targeted. Luyanda Manzini (33) from Actonville said she no longer goes to pray since she heard about the gang of rapists. “These guys don’t fear God. “How do you go and rape someone who is on her way to communicate with God? These guys are sick,” said Luyanda. Xolile Mthembu (26) said she had not dared to leave her home after 6pm since she heard about this. “I am terrified because I live alone.” Musawenkosi Nkosi (47), another local resident of Actonville, said he also heard about this incident and was willing to do anything he could to find these guys. “We will work together as a community to find them and bring them to justice. “They better hope and pray that police find them first before the community does because we will moer them before we call the police. “We are tired of such trash!” said Musawenkosi. Actonville police spokesman Pheello Mothapo said three rape cases were reported in a period of three months, two of them in August and one in October. “It seems to be the same guys who fit the same description. “Actonville police are working hard to find them and we will in the end,” said Pheello.
