Kazier Chiefs striker Khama Billiat expects an electric atmosphere at sold out FNB Stadium when he makes his Soweto derby debut against Orlando Pirates. The Zimbabwean joined the Naturena outfit during the off-season from Mamelodi Sundowns and is expected to start for Glamour Boys on Saturday. “The Soweto Derby is like no other local derby or game in the country,” said as quoted by the club’s official website. “The whole country virtually comes to a complete halt when the two Soweto giants meet, and we know that it is an important occasion for the fans. “I’ve been in South Africa for several years and watched the Soweto Derby on television but have never attended the game. It’s a huge privilege to be a part of this spectacle for the first time and I am looking forward to the experience as a player – especially in Kaizer Chiefs colours. “I know the atmosphere will be electric and we have to live up to the expectations of the Amakhosi supporters.” The 28-year-old reckons that a victory against their old foes will set the tone for the rest of the season and boost their confidence. “We know it’s not easy, but I believe it’s not about the previous games or form, it’s what you do on the day as a team,” he continued. “We need to work very hard because we know that winning will bring confidence for the rest of the season. I’m looking forward to the Soweto Derby experience with thousands of the Kaizer Chiefs Family and we need to ensure that we win it. “This will bring smiles to millions of supporters’ faces and help build our confidence for the rest of the season.”
