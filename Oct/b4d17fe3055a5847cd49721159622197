The Jesus Dominion International Church says they will
continue to support Timothy Omotoso. In a statement, the church says they would like to believe
in the justice system of the country and that Rev Omotoso's basic legal right
of the presumption of innocence will be upheld. â€œThe presumption of innocence principle means one is
considered innocent unless proven guilty," the church said. It further said: "Rev Omotoso deserves a free and fair
trial without any impartiality. As a church we want to believe this will be
made possible regardless of his country of origin. God bless." Omotoso, Zukiswa Sitho (28) and Lusanda Solani (36) are
facing charges of racketeering, violating the sexual offences act, human
trafficking and rape. He has been in prison since his arrest in April last year.
