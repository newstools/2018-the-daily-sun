The Department of Social Development will, in partnership
with the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund and Save the Children South Africa,
host the eighth Nelson Mandela Children’s Parliament (NMCP) on Friday in
Limpopo. Social Development spokesperson Justice Malapane
said  the event will be held under the theme,
“A Mandela in Every Generation: Amplifying the Voices of Children”,. He said this year’s parliament aims to encourage children
to exchange ideas about children’s rights to safety and protection as enshrined
in the Constitution and the Children’s Act. "In 1995, South Africa, under the leadership of the
late President Nelson Mandela, ratified the United Nations Convention on the
Rights of Children." he said. Malapane said the government works to ensure that the
safety and protection of children was prioritised in policies of Government and
in South Africa. This year, the programme of the Nelson Mandela Children’s
Parliament will celebrate the life and commitment of Nelson Mandela to the
children of South Africa by giving children an opportunity to participate in
policy development. He also said the Children’s Parliament will be directly
linked with the development of the new National Plan of Action for Children
(NPAC) and provide inputs for the National Child Participation Framework. Some of the topics that the children will be given an
opportunity to discuss include ending child marriages, the banning of corporal
punishment in the home which is expected to come be the court on November 29. He said among the delegates in the Children’s Parliament
will be children from underprivileged and previously-disadvantaged backgrounds
and those who have been deprived opportunities to learn about the country’s
legislation. The Children’s Parliament forms part of Social
Development month activities.
