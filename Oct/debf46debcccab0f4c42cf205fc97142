In the wake of the Minister of Home Affairs having had a video of his "home affairs" leaked, South Africans have taken to Twitter to comment on the incident in a humorous way. On Sunday, minister Malusi Gigaba revealed that a video containing material "of a sexual nature" was circulating in political circles and has been used in blackmail and extortion attempts against him. In a series of tweets, Gigaba said the video was stolen from his cellphone after it was hacked in either 2016 or 2017. He added that the video's content was only meant to be viewed by his wife and himself. As Gigaba finds himself in a tight spot, with a hard time ahead of him, people have taken to Twitter to mock and ridicule the minister for the sexually explicit video. SOURCE:Â NEWS24
