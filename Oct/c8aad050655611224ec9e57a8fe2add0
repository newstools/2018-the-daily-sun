PALESA Matolweni’s family had prepared a cleansing ceremony for her on Sunday. When the time came, everything was ready and everybody was there – but Palesa herself was nowhere to be seen. The 20-year-old from Katlehong in Ekurhuleni was locked up for the entire weekend by a man who allegedly poisoned her. Her sister, Thulisile Matolweni (30) said the ceremony was to cleanse Palesa as she had had a miscarriage. “We were waiting for her at Orange Farm but she never showed up,” she said. Thulisile said she went to the suspect’s place but it was quiet. She said she knocked and heard a short scream but she couldn’t tell if it was her. “After he threatened that I would find both of them dead, I went to the police station. I went back with the police and he came out holding a Coke bottle.” Thulisile said they found it contained crushed glass from a light bulb, Jeyes Fluid, thinners and bleach. Palesa had a belt tied around her neck and they suspect he may have tried to strangle her. But Palesa survived. She was taken to the local clinic and referred to hospital. Her mum, Ntombizandile Matolweni (49), said they had prepared everything from mqombothi to chickens. “If we get money again, we’ll repeat the ceremony.” Police spokesman Captain Mega Ndobe confirmed a 20-year-old male suspect was arrested and is expected to appear in Palm Ridge Magistrates Court soon on charges of attempted murder and kidnapping.
