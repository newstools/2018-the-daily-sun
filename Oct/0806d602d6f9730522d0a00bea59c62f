KIDS at Gobizembe High School were left traumatised after a grade 9 pupil was stabbed to death on Monday. The KZN Education Department has promised to send counsellors to the school in Swayimane, outside Pietermaritzburg. Ayanda Chonco (17) was apparently trying to come between two fighting pupils when he was stabbed. It’s believed the two pupils were fighting over a girl. On Wednesday, Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana and head of department Enoch Zama visited Ayanda’s family to offer their condolences. Department spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the MEC was concerned about pupils attacking each other at school. He told pupils not to avenge Ayanda’s death. Monday’s stabbing came just days after the MEC said the past year had been challenging for the department as a number of pupils had been killed. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident. “We can confirm that a 17-year-old was found lying on the road with a stab wound in his back,” said Mbele. “He was certified dead at the scene and a case of murder was opened at Wartburg Police Station for investigation.” Mbele said an 18-year-old was arrested and would appear in court soon.
