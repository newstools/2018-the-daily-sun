After a successful premier in 2017, the Nubian Music Festival is back for another installment. Adding to the already packed December gig guide, the festival will turn Hartbeespoort into a festival of music and culture. Due to take place at the Eagle Waters Wildlife Resort, in Hartbeespoort Dam, North West between 14 and 17 December 2018, the Nubian Music Festival is a celebration of African culture through the powerful medium of music and dance. This year’s line-up boasts a stellar cast of award-winning musicians: Mafikizolo, MiCasa, Lira, Oliver Mtukudzi, Selaelo Selota, Candy Tsamandebele and Nigeria’s Kunle Ayo who are just some of the diverse acts who will entertain crowds at the festival. The main festival will happen on 16 December 2018 where all of these legendary acts will perform. Those in attendance can also look forward to the Afrocentric R&B and neo soul sounds of Donald Moatshe, Afrotraction and Encore. Depending on your booking, the festival will also give some of its patrons full access to the pools, fishing facilities, water sports as well as the lion and cheetah parks, zoo and elephant sanctuary, as well as a movie under the stars. Tickets to enter the 2018 Nubian Music Festival are available at Computicket and will cost R300 for General access and R1 500 for VIP access. The festival will wrap up on the 17th of December, where full festival package holders will be treated to a champagne breakfast aboard a boat. “The weekend will build on the foundation of last year's inaugural event and includes a larger and more diverse lineup of quality live performances, coupled with craft and family entertainment. The Nubian Festival aims to make Hartbeespoort a beacon of tourism in the North West Province,” said Mpho Mathope, Eagle Waters Wildlife Resort General Manager and founder of Nubian Touch (Pty) Ltd who own the Nubian Music Festival. Gates to the festival will open at 10.00 with the show starting at midday and ending at midnight.
