THE Verulam Family Court has sent the man who called
President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a widely circulated Facebook video for
mental observation. The ruling was made on Tuesday that Kessie Nair be sent
for mental observation before applying for bail. State prosecutor Carlson Govender and Nair's attorney
Chris Gounden had submitted their final arguments on Monday afternoon on the
state's application that Nair be sent for a 28-day mental assessment at Fort
Napier Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. Nair, the former Durban councillor and convicted
fraudster, is facing six counts of crimen injuria and two of incitement of
public violence. Govender argued that Nair should be treated as an
in-patient at Fort Napier.
