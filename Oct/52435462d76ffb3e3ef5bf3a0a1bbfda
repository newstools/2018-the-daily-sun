THUGS who think they can rob this sangoma or take cars from his yard can forget about it. That’s because sangoma Mahlabe Zulu has no less than three security guards protecting him and his family. But his protectors are not men of flesh and blood, but three dummies that have magic muthi inside! Sangoma Mahlabe said each of the three dummies had its own duty. One dummy is for guarding his cars, another is for scaring thugs at the gate and one stays inside his indumba. During the day, they look like normal mannequins, but at night they turn into scary creatures. “These dummies are like security guards. Thugs and bad people don’t dare come near my house,” he said. The dummy standing next to his cars wears a reflector. He named it Somhlolo and said it performed miracles at night, hence the name. “At night, my family sleep peacefully. I don’t fear that my cars will be stolen,” he said. Daily Sun spoke to residents in the area who said they feared going too close to the sangoma’s yard at night. “We hear that those dolls are more than just dolls.” The sangoma said he wasn’t keeping the dolls to himself. “People come to ask for the same and I help them,” he said. He said most of his customers are those looking for help to secure their cars. “It’s a well-known fact that you need to be protected when driving as there are many evil spirits around. “These dummies have also helped people haunted by tokoloshes.” He said most of his clients preferred small dolls to put in their cars to protect them from having accidents.
