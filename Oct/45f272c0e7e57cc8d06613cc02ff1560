THE ANC and DA officials don’t see eye to eye over the running of Modimolle-Mookgopong Municipality. The ANC has blamed the DA for the lack of service delivery in the area since it took over two years. The DA said the ANC was a bitter loser and didn’t want to co-operate as an opposition party in the council. Matome Tauatsoala, of the ANC in Waterberg, said: “The DA coalition has been in office for two years. The only thing they seem to have on their agenda appears to be a co-ordinated effort to get black communities infected with all sorts of diseases, emanating from the brown water and sewage spillage in Modimolle. “The people of Modimolle ward 6 have not had water for more than two years. “Jay Naidoo Street in Modimolle has been flooded with sewer spillage for the past eight months. “The residents of Mookgopong extension 2 have been sweeping the sewage water from their yards for two weeks. “The problem has been caused by a blocked drain.” Jacques Smalle, a DA leader in Limpopo, said: “The ANC is failing to admit that DA coalition in the municipality is cleaning up the financial and administrative mess the ANC left behind. This is as a result of many years of poor and corrupt management. “Claims that ward 6 residents have been without water for the past two months with unfixed sewer problems for the past eight months are simply not true. “The municipality always tries to address water and sewerage complaints as soon as they happen. But these efforts have, at times, been slowed down by the poor infrastructure resulting from years of misrule by the previous ANC government.” Smalle said ever since the DA and its partners took over the municipality, it has been met by resistance from the ANC. He said the ANC didn’t want to accept the fact that it was no longer in control and could no longer abuse municipal finances.
