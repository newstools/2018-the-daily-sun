A 1.5 metre long python surprised bank staff when it dropped
from the ceiling. The python reportedly entered the Xin Cheng branch of
China's Industrial and Commercial Bank in Guangxi Zhuang and dropped down
between two employees. In the video, staff can be seen running away as the python dropped
on the floor.
