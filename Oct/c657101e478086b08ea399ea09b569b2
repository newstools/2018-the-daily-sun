ESETHU Adams (23) from Town Two in Khayelitsha, Cape Town was heavily pregnant when a fire broke out over the weekend. One person died in the fire and more than 1 000 people were left homeless. Like other victims, Esethu took refuge in a church, where she gave birth to a baby boy on Tuesday. “I lost all my baby’s clothes in the fire. It destroyed everything we had,” said Esethu. “I started feeling labour pains at about 1am. We shared the church with men and they saw me in pain, but I did not give birth in front of them. They could hear everything though.” She said she was taken into another room by some women who helped deliver the baby. By the time an ambulance arrived, Esethu had already given birth. The mother of two is currently staying with a resident who did not want her to go back to the church because it is so crowded. “I would be happy to get help because I am unemployed,” she said. “I know that we cannot live here forever.” Nomvuyo Ntethe (52) told Daily Sun one of the residents took the new mother in as they could not allow her to go back to the church with a newborn. “There are many people sleeping in the church and we know that a newborn needs a quiet place,” said Ntethe. “Our chairmanwill accommodate her until her shack is rebuilt,” she said. They called the child “Blessing” as he was born in a church.
