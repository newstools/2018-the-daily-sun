THE excited Mpumalanga woman who has been blessed with triplets said she was not expecting three bouncing babies. Phumzile Mathebula (36) from Merry Pebble Stream Trust, outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, became the first woman in her village to give birth to triplets. The three boys were born on Friday at Mapulaneng Hospital. The jobless mum told Daily Sun her husband Andries Mkhombo (41) was also unemployed and they needed any kind of help to raise their sons. Phumzile said they depend solely on social grants received by three children. “Raising them will be hard as my husband and I are unemployed. We ask anyone, including government, to assist us with any form of help,” said the mum. Phumzile said when labour pains started on Thursday, she honestly didn’t know she was carrying three babies. “We named them Tebogo, Thabiso and Tumisho as they have brought excitement and happiness to our family.” Andries said he was happy to welcome three sons. Mpumalanga Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said: “The mother is encouraged to go to the nearest health facility for immunisations for the boys and other related check-ups. She must contact Sassa offices for further assistance.”
