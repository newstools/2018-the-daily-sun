NEIGHBOURS are in shock after a dog they described as “an
absolute angel” went crazy and tore off a man’s 4-5 and balls. According to the Daily Record, the unnamed 22-year-old
man had been visiting a woman in her flat in Haddington, Scotland on 7 October. Neighbours said they heard the dog barking at about 4am
and again at 8am, but cops weren’t called to the scene until 2.30pm. There they discovered a horror scene of a man lying in a
pool of blood, missing his 4-5, and a bulldog restrained but covered in blood. It’s unclear exactly what happened, but some believe the
victim may actually have been held down during the dog attack. The usually friendly dog is called Biggie Smalls after
the famous American gangster rapper shot dead in 1997. Confused neighbours can’t understand how the bulldog could
go so quickly from angel to devil. “Biggie is such a
nice dog. He isn’t aggressive or anything, and he’s quite small. He’s fine with
other dogs. “The dog is an absolute angel. I was happy to be around
him. “He gets a bit freaked out by noise but he loves having
his belly rubbed,” said a neighbour. The victim was rushed to hospital and put into an induced
coma. Biggie Smalls has been taken to kennels, said the report.
