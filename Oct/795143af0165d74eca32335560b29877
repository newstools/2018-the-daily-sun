A GROUP of students has to deal with regular invasions while preparing for exams. However, they’re not being harassed by thugs or protesters, but by livestock. Students at Walter Sisulu University’s Nelson Mandela Drive and Zamukulungisa campuses in Mthatha said noisy goats, cows, sheep and horses even came into their lecture rooms. Student Busisiwe Radana said they had to chase four goats off campus last week. “These animals pee in our lecture rooms. They even walk around our residences as if they own the place,” she said. Another student said on Sunday night, they found goats in an auditorium on Zamukulungisa campus. “They get in through the holes in the fence,” he said. SRC members Asanda Mtshezi and Sophie Faltein said the animals’ presence made students uncomfortable. They said the SRC couldn’t do anything other than alert management. “We fear the same holes the animals use to get in through the fence will be used by criminals as well,” said Asanda. “We want people who send their animals to graze near the campus to come and collect them.” Security guards at the Nelson Mandela Drive campus also complained about the situation. They said they were hired to look after students, not animals. University spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo said stray animals often wandered into the campuses, which are near a village. “I can’t confirm claims about livestock wandering into lecture rooms because this has not been reported. “The reports are mostly about animals in our grounds,” she said. “We will ask the SPCA to assist us. “We appeal to members of the community to take responsibility for their livestock that is causing unnecessary challenges for the university.”
