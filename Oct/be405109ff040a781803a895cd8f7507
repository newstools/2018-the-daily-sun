KELEABETSWE’S small business is great news for women who enjoy
beauty treatments. Keleabetswe Mahuma (21) has created an app called Vanguard
Styles, enabling people to book hairstylists, make-up and nail artists at their
own homes. She told Daily Sun she found a gap in the market and, like
any other business, decided to explore ways of fulfilling customers’ needs. “Beauty plays an important part in everyone’s lives, from
young to old. This app offers a range of hairstyles, weaves, braids, nails and
make-up services at affordable prices.” Keleabetswe said in a very short space of time, the app
started receiving positive reviews. “This puts the focus on the experience beauticians offer to
clients. “Not only is the app reliable but also focuses on bringing
professionals to customers to take care of their appearance for all occasions.” Keleabetswe said using social media marketing helped her
business and it has been featured on e.tv’s Frenzy. She said there are more opportunities to look into, like
barber services. “This type of industry is timeless, as people are in
constant need of hair and beauty treatments,” said Keleabetswe.
