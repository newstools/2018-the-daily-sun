THE thugs robbed Thabiso Rigala (31) of his groceries and cellphone in full view of other people. A roadside barber who saw the incident warned the thugs not to use his spot to rob shoppers. That’s when the thugs turned on the barber and stabbed him, before fleeing with Thabiso’s goods. “That man was stabbed for trying to protect me. He died trying to keep the peace at his workplace,” said Thabiso. Thabiso, from Caleb Motshabi kasi in Mangaung, said he had just bought grocery hampers when he was attacked by three thugs in the Bloemfontein CBD on Saturday afternoon “They demanded my groceries and I refused. They produced knives and took my cellphone and R1 500 worth of grocery hampers,” said Thabiso. “The spot where they robbed me was being used by a man who cut hair. “He saw what was happening and pleaded with the thugs to stop what they were doing. “I ran away after they robbed me and they chased the barber and stabbed him.” The barber was certified dead at his spot. Parkweg police spokesman LieutenantColonel Thabo Covane said a case of murder was opened. “A 46-year-old man from Phase 9 kasi in Mangaung was assisting a robbery victim when he was attacked. A suspect stabbed him once in the chest and he died at the scene. A known suspect is still at large.”
