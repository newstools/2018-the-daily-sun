A ROUTINE stop-and-check roadblock by the JMPD turned out to be anything but routine when they stopped a big truck on Albertina Sisulu Road in Joburg on Tuesday night. The truck, with Malawian registration plates, seemed to be over the height and weight limit. When officers asked the Malawian driver what was under the covers in the back, he said he was delivering 20-litre water containers to Malawi. When officers asked him what was moving under the covers, he said it was sheep. But when officers checked under the covers, they didn’t find sheep. The officers moved things around and three Malawian men appeared. JMPD spokesman Wayne Minnaar said the officers noticed the three men appeared nervous and looked further. “The officers investigated and discovered 19 more men hiding underneath the load. All the men were from Malawi,” he said. “The officers also found 43 fake passports and stolen goods including laptops and cell phones. “We suspect that the driver was running a human trafficking operation taking people from Malawi to South Africa and back,” he added. The driver was arrested for possession of suspected stolen goods. The 22 men who were discovered in the truck were also arrested. The driver is currently being investigated on suspected human trafficking charges.
