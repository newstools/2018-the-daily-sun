EMPLOYEES at the Toyota manufacturing plant in Prospecton, near Isipingo, south of Durban went back to work on Monday. They have been on strike for the whole of last week. One of their demands was for the employer to re-hire temporary workers who were laid off last February when sales in the company dropped. They also wanted the employer to stop deducting money from their salaries every month. The deductions were meant to repay the R10 000 they each received from the company last year to fix their homes after they were damaged by storms. Even though representatives from Numsa failed to tick all the boxes of their demands, the workers said they were happy that they got half the conditions they wanted. “We are happy that in the next intake, the temporary workers who were laid off last year will be brought back,” said one employee. Another employee said they hoped that the deduction issue would be resolved in the next two months, as agreed during negotiations. He said when they received the money last year, they weren’t told they would have to pay it back. “We were only told that it was a gift from Japan to help us fix our homes,” said the employee. Numsa KZN regional secretary Mbuso Ngubane confirmed that the employees were back at work. “Most of the issues they were not happy about were resolved during the negotiations,” he said.
