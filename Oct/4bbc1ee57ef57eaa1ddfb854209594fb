MOST of his peers aged 10 are found playing on the streets. But grade 4 pupil Thapelo “Ishmael” Ramakokobo from Tshwane is already a well-known healer in his kasi. Sick people often queue at his place. Luckily the youngster doesn’t have to do all his healing duties by himself. He works with his dad, Elias. He quit his job to assist his young son, who tells him how to help their patients. Thapelo often sends his dad to the river, koppie or bush to bathe and pray for people. Elias, who has been given the name Israel by his son, said Thapelo started by interpreting dreams. He said his son would tell them what the dreams meant. “Everything he predicted came true. We thought he was just gifted, but he started prophesying at church,” he said. He said at first he thought his son’s gift would affect his education, but it didn’t. “He is very smart and gets good marks. Teachers have called me to the school several times to congratulate me on his achievements.” He said although some people might look down on him for working for his son, he wasn’t bothered. “In the face of the Lord we are all equal and gifts of the Holy Spirit are different,” he said. Thapelo said he enjoyed helping people. He said his gift didn’t stop him from playing like other kids. “I pray for people and instruct my dad to help them. I can play while he’s washing people in the river,” he said. He said despite instructing his father, he still respected him. “I only send him when it has to do with the work of God.”
