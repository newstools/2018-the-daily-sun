WAS it the fault of the bed - or was it the woman’s energetic
poking that resulted in Claire Busby (46) being paralysed? This is the question a court in England is being asked to
decide, according to the Sun. In Claire’s version of the tragic incident, the cause was
that her new bed hadn’t been properly put together by Beds Are Uzzzz, the Berkshire
bed company she bought it from. Claire is demanding £1 million (about R18,6 million) in
compensation from the bed suppliers. Claire told the High Court this week she had been
kneeling in the middle of the bed performing a sex act on her partner. When she
changed positions, suddenly she was just thrown off the bed as it gave way
because it was missing two feet. She fell off, landed on her head, and suffered a serious
back injury which has left her paralysed. She said: “I spun around, I put my hand down and then I
felt like I was catapulted off the back of the bed. "My head hit the floor, I fell to the side and then
I heard like a spring in my body snap, it felt like." Her sister, Natalie, told the court how her sister went
on to have two heart attacks in 24 hours and “it was touch and go whether she
was going to make it”. But the supplier says there was no problem with the bed
they delivered to Claire’s home in August 2013. Attorney for the bed company, Neil Block, told the court:
“It is overwhelmingly likely that, whatever her actions, they were too close to
the edge of the bed and she simply lost her balance and toppled backwards.” The hearing continues.
