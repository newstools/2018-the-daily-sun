THAMSANQA Hlongwane’s family have unanswered questions. The 16-year-old grade 9 Inkosi Albert Luthuli Secondary School pupil from Ntshawini, KwaDukuza, KZN drowned after going to Blythedale Beach with kasi men last Monday. On Thursday, his body was recovered near Zinkwazi Beach. His uncle Thulebuka Mhlongo (33) said: “The two men were older than him. He wasn’t friends with them. We want to know how they persuaded him to go with them.” He said Thamsanqa would not have gone to the place where he drowned if he were with friends. “His friends said he told them that place was dangerous for swimming. We have questions about how he ended up there.” He said the men Thamsanqa had gone with never reported to them. “Instead of telling us what happened, they went to the lifeguards. We want police to question them.” KwaDukuza lifeguard superintendent Bongani Xulu said: “We began our search directly after the incident and continued with other teams. The teen’s body was spotted floating on the water on Thursday at Zinkwazi Beach, 1km away from where he drowned.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “Police recovered the body of a 16-year-old boy at Zinkwazi Beach, washed away at Blythedale Beach on 1 October.” She said an inquest docket was opened.
