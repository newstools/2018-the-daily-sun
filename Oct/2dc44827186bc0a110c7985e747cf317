The legal representative of former security branch police
officer Joao Rodrigues is expected to argue why he should not be prosecuted for
the murder of Ahmed Timol. His legal representative is expected to appear before the
South Gauteng High Court on Monday. A statement released by the Timol family revealed that the
legal representative is expected to argue that Rodrigues shouldn’t be prosecuted
on the basis of his age. He is also expected to argue that he shouldn’t be prosecuted
on account of the time that has passed since Timol’s murder. The North Gauteng High Court last year found that Timol had
died at the hands of the apartheid security police while he was detained. It was revealed that he did not commit suicide, as was
earlier reporter, but died after he was pushed by members of the Security
Branch.
