Mzansi women, like Mshoza and many others,are known for their butt implants. But what many in Mzansi does not know, is that a Brazilian butt lift can cost anything between R75K and R100K. In a recent interview with Business Insider, Cape Town plastic surgeon Dr Dirk Lazarus revealed that younger women in Mzansi are flocking to add more junk in their trunk. The procedure is said to cost anything in the range of R75, 000 and R100, 000. It involves taking fat from a different part of the body and injecting into the bum to make it bigger. Patients who go through this procedure are said to be able to return to work a week after the operation. However, it can take up to six months for the junk to settle in the trunk. The patients are screened to determine whether theyâ€™re psychologically and physically ready for the operation. They are also checked to see if they have enough fat for the operation. The operation does come, however, with dangers. In a recent statement by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, it was revealed that 1 in 3000 Brazilian Butt Lift patients die. The deaths occur typically when fat is injected into the wrong places. The institution asserted that the Brazilian Butt Lift is the deadliest procedure in the United States. Mzansi Kwaito star Mshoza made headlines when she claimed that she has the biggest butt implant in the country.
