Police minister General Bheki Cele is expected to visit Westbury on Tuesday following violent protest in the area. Cele is expected to address the community at around 11:30 at the Westbury Recreation Centre. WATCH: JULLE MA SE P**S! Westbury have vowed to continue with the shutdown until police minister Bheki Cele has addresses them or the army is deployed in the area. The shutdown began after a woman was caught in a crossfire last week Thursday, and was killed. Her 10-year-old daughter was injured during the shoot-out. On Friday, after the shoot-out, residents closed roads with burning tyres and rocks demanding the army to be sent to the area. They said they are sick of gangsterism and want it to be dealt with immediately. On Monday morning as the Westbury community continued with their shut down, the South African Police Services (SAPS) was deployed to the area.
