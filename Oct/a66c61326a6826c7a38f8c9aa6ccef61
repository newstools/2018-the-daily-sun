A CHILD without education is like a bird without wings. Once children have finished school, many find it difficult to fly once they leave the school nest. That is where Tswelopele ka Thuto comes in. It helps high school pupils by exposing them to different career choices through mentoring and career guidance. They also assist pupils with tertiary institutions’ requirements, provide information on funding assistance and options. The organisation was founded in 2015 by UJ student Nthabiseng Mokhothu (25), from Tshwane. “Having gone through struggles over which path to take after high school, I realised the best way to steer kids in the right direction was having professionals explain their career paths,” Nthabiseng said. The organisation also does charity work through stationery drives and soup kitchens. It collects and distributes school shoes, clothes and blankets to pupils, also providing cooked meals for poor kids. It is working with third year UJ marketing students to assist with marketing on different media platforms, fundraising, transformation and planning. Nthabiseng said more organisations were needed to help kids focus on building their future and not destroying their lives by getting involved in drugs or crime.
