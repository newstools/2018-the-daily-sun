MPUMALANGA Transport MEC Gillion Mashego has called on motorists to stop driving under the influence. He said this would help minimise road crashes during the festive season. Mashego was speaking at the official opening of the newly built road in Mkhuhlu, outside Hazyview, on Friday. The new road, which leads to the Mpumalanga Traffic Training College, will make life easier for motorists visiting the institution. “Over and above that, we are pleading with road users, especially motorists, to use the road responsibly because it’s clear that human behaviour is the common factor in these accidents,” said Mashego. “It costs government a lot of money to deal with road accidents.” The MEC said the health department had a long list of orthopaedic patients awaiting surgical procedures due to road crashes. “The Road Accident Fund is depleted by the huge volume of claims,” said Mashego. “Expensive emergency services have to be channelled to each case. In the process, our roads get damaged by these accidents and have to be fixed. “Ultimately, more money is spent on addressing issues that could have been easily avoided if someone had been responsible enough to guard their own safety. “We can’t afford to improve our roads at the detriment of people’s lives.” He said the road cost R30 million. More than 17 people were employed during the the project, while 10 small business owners benefited.
