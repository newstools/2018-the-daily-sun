MUMS from Kosovo squatter camp in Cape Town who were victims of a fire got baby formula on Friday. Abathunywa Ministers Fraternity and South Africans For Community partnered to help the women. The fire destroyed 120 structures and affected 500 people. Abathunywa founder Zamuxolo Mfihlo said: “When there are fire incidents, no one thinks about the mums with babies.” He said that’s why they decided to donate baby formula and clothes. “It’s everything to these people. They have nothing and some are unemployed,” he said. Co-ordinator Fezeka Matiwane said they couldn’t just fold their arms while people suffered. “We know many of the mums are unemployed and need formula.” Nyanga Environmental Health gave the mums food parcels. Angelina Sititshi (30) was happy to receive her donations. “We’re struggling. The fire left us with nothing and most of us are unemployed. “Most of the time when people donate, they only think about adults and not babies. We’re grateful because now our babies have food.” Esinako Astarha (38) said: “It’s a big relief because we don’t have to stress about what our babies are going to eat.”
