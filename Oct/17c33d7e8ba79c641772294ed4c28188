WORKERS at the Enduduzweni Centre for the Disabled in Umlazi, south of Durban, have threatened to take KZN Social Development MEC Weziwe Thusi to court. The madalas and gogos, who live at the centre, say the MEC must release their stipends by the end of the month or face the consequences. This comes after officials from Thusi’s office arrived on Monday. The workers, most of whom are blind, were given letters notifying them that they would no longer be paid their monthly stipends. This is because the senior citizens are refusing to leave the centre. They told Daily Sun on Tuesday they would leave the centre in coffins. “We will fight until the bitter end. We are prepared to fight the MEC until the matter reaches the ConCourt,” they said. Themba Shiba, chairman of the African Nduduzweni Organisation for the Disabled, said Thusi is heartless. “We never expected such treatment from a black government that is supposed to take care of disabled people,” said Shiba. He added that Thusi’s department has been taking the craft work they produce and paying them R4 000 monthly. “They have been trying to kick us out of here since 2015. “We refuse to go because the site was donated to us in 1972 by the then inkosi. “This is against the law because the matter about the ownership of the place is still in court. If they don’t pay us at the end of the month, we will definitely meet the MEC in court. “Our lawyers are on top of things,” said Shiba. Social Development spokeswoman Ncumisa Ndelu said the centre is not a residential area. “It is a training facility for people with disabilities. They are supposed to go home after training,” said Ndelu. She added that the stipend was suspended because workers are no longer producing work.
