MOVE over Milan,  Enhle Gebashe’s designer clothes are about to take centre stage. At just 10, Enhle isn’t only designing clothes, she sews and models them too. Enhle, from Melrose in Joburg, might be the youngest designer in the country, but she’s already competing with the person she got her inspiration from – her mum. The grade 5 pupil said she started designing at the age of six. “I used to cut my clothes and change them to look how I wanted them to be,” she said. Enhle said she only started making clothes this year. “I’m in the process of registering my brand,” she said. Enhle said her inspiration was African prints. “I like the bright colours of African print fabrics. “I also want to start making bags, shoes and accessories in the future and be able to sell globally.” She said her focus was on designing kids’ clothes from four to 12 years. “My target is ordinary to fashionable kids who want to embrace the African culture in their outfits,” she said. Her mum, Desiree (33) is also a designer. She said Enhle started picking her own clothes at two years old and that she inherited her mum’s love and passion for fashion. She said many people had already placed orders. “People want these clothes for their kids, but Enhle is trying to balance her design work with her books. “I hope she will be able to cope,” said Desiree.
