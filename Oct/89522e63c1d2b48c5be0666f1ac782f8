SIMON Murray’s brace helped Bidvest Wits beat Cape Town City 2-0 at Cape Town Stadium last night to return to the top of Absa Premiership table. The Students are two points ahead of Soweto giants Orlando Pirates with 16 points from eight matches, while The Citizens have dropped from tenth to occupy 12th spot with six points from seven games. The Scottish born player burst City’s bubble when he broke the ice in the eighth minute via a controversial penalty after the referee had adjudged keeper Peter Leeuwenburgh to have fouled him while he stumbled in a bid to score. The 26 year-old came back to haunt City on the stroke of half time when he doubled his tally with a cool finish. The Students maintained their unbeaten run away this season as they recorded three wins and draw from four matches on the road. The win has boosted Wits morale ahead of their crucial league clash against defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Sunday. But the defeat is a huge blow for Benni McCarthy’s side as a lot was expected from his boys after they lifted the MTN8 Cup on Saturday following a 4-1 win on penalties over SuperSport United in Durban. Wits had lost their last league game 1-0 to Polokwane City at home a fort night ago. They beat City 2-1 in a league match in February, while Benni McCarthy’s boys beat them 1-0 in the first round last season. City approached the game high in confidence with the backing of their home crowd who were hoping that lady luck will smile on them to turn the corner in the league. Their players had to put their celebration on ice in a bid to end their win less league run having gone five league games without a win as they last tasted victory when they beat Matsatsantsa a Pitori 2-0 in their opening match. The Citizens have only managed to collect four points from three home games so far.
