AFTER madala Zinyusile Njokwana’s RDP house was severely damaged by a fire in April, he couldn’t afford to fix his home and tried to patch what he could. But with no roof over his head or windows, the 73-year-old from Browns Farm near Philippi in Cape Town had no choice but to start living like a hobo in the ruins. “When it rained heavily I would try to go to a friend’s place for the night. “I am very sick and at times I would just stay here while it rained because I didn’t want to be a burden to people,” the madala said. But now madala Zinyusile’s future is looking brighter because the EFF has decided to intervene and fix the house. Philippi branch chairman Kutula Soqaga said they met the madala during recent door-to-door visits and couldn’t stand by and watch his suffering. “We reached out to our regional body and asked for funds and we are happy that they responded positively,” said Soqaga. EFF regional chair Unathi Ntame accused government of failing to fix people’s houses after they burned down. “We were sad to see an old person living like this and we bought material to fix the roof and windows and paint the house to restore his dignity,” said Ntame. Madala’s friend Griffiths Mohale (67) said it was painful to watch his friend living like a hobo. “He was also starting to act abnormally because it was as if he was living under a bridge. I’m happy that the house will be fixed,” said Griffiths. Repairs to madala Zinyusile’s house are expected to be completed in about a month’s time. The madala couldn’t hold back tears when he thanked the EFF members. “I didn’t know that there are people who cared and I feared that my cold body would be found here one day,” he said.
