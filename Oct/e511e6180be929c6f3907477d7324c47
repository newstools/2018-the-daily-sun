THEIR prayers rose loudly as they gathered around the small coffin of 10-year-old Nonhlanhla Mabena. Louder and louder the church members and family prayed, as if they were possessed, calling on God to exact justice. They were praying that those who killed Nonhlanhla and stole her body parts would follow her soon. “We pray to the living God. “The person who did this will not live long,” said one of the pastors. Nonhlanhla, from Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni, died a gruesome death when her two legs and one arm were cut off with what cops believe was an angle grinder. The rest of her body was later found dumped not far from her home. One of her legs was found two days later. On Saturday the family had to bury her with one leg and an arm still missing. Nonhlanhla disappeared two weeks ago after her mother had sent her to a shop to buy headache powder. When Nonhlanhla failed to return from the shop, mum Josephine became worried. She went to look for the little girl and was soon joined by residents, but they came up empty-handed. Nonhlanhla’s body was found a day later. Residents started accusing a local sangoma, Belina Mhlongo, of the evil act and even burned her house and two cars – but it turned out that the sangoma was not behind the murder. Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said their police dogs searched the sangoma’s house and found nothing. “We are still searching for the real suspects. The community will know who they are once we have arrested them and they appear in court.” He confirmed that the girl was buried with some of her body parts still missing, adding that police were still searching for the remaining body parts.
