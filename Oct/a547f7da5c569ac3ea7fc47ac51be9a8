President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the Jobs Summit in Midrand on Thursday. The summit will be convened under the auspices of the National Economic Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC) on Thursday and Friday 4 and 5 October 2018, at the Gallagher Convention Centre. President Ramaphosa undertook in the 2018 State of the Nation Address that a Jobs Summit would be convened to align the efforts of all sectors and stakeholders behind the imperative of job creation and to develop practical measures and initiatives to create employment for millions of South Africans. "The President stated that the Summit would examine what needs to be done to ensure the economy grows and becomes more productive, that companies invest on a far greater scale that workers are better equipped, and that economic infrastructure is expanded. "The Jobs Summit, which is inter-related with the International Investment Conference that will take place later this month, will bring together all NEDLAC constituencies comprising government, organised labour, organised business and organised community to focus on collaborative and high-impact interventions to drive job creation, job retention and economic growth," said presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko. President Ramaphosa will be supported on the government side by Deputy President David Mabuza and members of Cabinet.
