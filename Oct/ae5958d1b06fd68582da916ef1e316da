THE Esikhaleni Regional Court sentenced a 53-year-old mkhulu to life in prison for raping his biological granddaughter. According to police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, in July 2014, the victim (12) was at her grandfather’s homestead at Inyembe Reserve in Port Dunford, when the mkhulu advanced on her and raped her while her grandmother was at work. “The accused threatened to kill the victim and her brother if she reported the incident to anyone. The accused continued to repeatedly rape the victim from 2014 to 2017, until the victim reported the matter to her teacher,” Zwane said. A case of rape was reported at Esikhaleni SAPS and the docket was transferred to Empangeni Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation. Zwane  said after a thorough investigation by the FCS Unit the accused was arrested. “He made several court appearances during his incarceration until he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for raping his grandchild,” Zwane added.
