THESE train commuters hate Spring. People usually celebrate the first day of Spring by throwing buckets of water on each other. But train commuters have stones thrown at them for almost the whole month. Angry commuters said they were sick and tired of the custom which happens every year. They said whenever Spring starts, they are terrified of what’s coming. What terrifies them even more is that some train windows do not have glass in them. Commuters who travel from Joburg to Springs are pleading with government to do something about the stone throwing. They said this only happened in September as the train passed Germiston Station. Ntombifuthi Makhanya (26) from Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, said she was tired of the unwelcome trend. She added that she had no choice but to use the train as it was cheaper than a taxi. “Spring time brings fear. After passing Germiston, we know we need to keep our heads down, which is difficult because there are so many of us in the train,” said Ntombifuthi. Another commuter, Miriam Nkambule (46), was injured on 10 September. She wants Prasa to do something about replacing the glass in the windows. She said she can’t stop using the train because she is a domestic worker and she has to budget. “I have been a domestic worker for eight years. This Spring stone culture has been happening for years and this time I was a victim. This needs to stop.” Commuters are also complaining about trains stopping at places that do not have stations. “People who live in these areas need trains as well but our safety should come first,” said another commuter, Sandile Ngomane. Numerous attempts to reach Prasa for comment were unsuccessful.
