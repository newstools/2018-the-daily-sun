AMAZULU FC and Cape Town City’s clash is expected to set the tone for this weekend’s MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) festival. The two clubs have been flying high since the season started in August. AmaZulu are at the top of the MDC standings with 10 points from four games while the Citizens are second, just one point behind Usuthu from the same number of matches. The two outfits will face off tomorrow in the first match of this weekend’s festival at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium in Clermont (10am). The two-day festival will also feature fixtures involving Orlando Pirates, Kaizer Chiefs and two-time MDC champions Golden Arrows. AmaZulu, who have yet to taste defeat in the 2018-19 MDC season, have been impressive compared to last season, where they struggled for the better half of the campaign. Coach Ayanda Dlamini has vowed that they won’t make things easy for any opponents. “This season we told ourselves that we have to compete, we must give every team we face a run for their money. And so far, the boys have done that,” said Dlamini, himself a former striker. “Another factor that has helped us improve is the fact that we have a small squad of 20 players, unlike last season where we had more than 30 players in the MDC. Now it is easier for us to manage them,” added Dlamini. “The main thing we must do now is to try and maintain this performance level.” After four rounds of games, Pirates, Black Leopards, Highlands Park and Maritzburg United are the only teams that have not registered victory. And this season could be a tough one for Pirates in particular, who have brought inexperienced new blood into their squad.
