RESIDENTS of Mangaung were hopeful when a new fire station was built in Chris Hani kasi. The well equipped station was built four years ago but has never been used.Mangaung firefighters told Daily Sun about R25 million was spent to build the fire station. They said the construction of station was finished in early 2014. “Everything that is needed is in the building. It only needs staff to make it functional. It was built to attend to fires, especially in Caleb Motshabi, where there are many shack fires. “Our municipality only cares for towns and doesn’t bother to safeguard people in the kasi. It takes more than 15 minutes to reach Caleb Motshabi from the fire station in town. More than R25 million was used to build the place but it’s just a white elephant,” said a firefighter. Guards at the building said there were snakes in the yard, which is now surrounded by bush. “Municipal workers used to clean the yard twice a month but stopped in the middle of last year. “We have killed snakes in the yard. The ceiling is collapsing. People have reported fires, thinking the place is working,” said a guard. Municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama told  Daily Sun : “We are working on administration processes so we can start advertising and employing people. This was delayed by financial constraints.”
