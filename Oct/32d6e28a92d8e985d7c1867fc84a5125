Bafana Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo insists they did not underestimate Seychelles in their AFCON qualifier on Tuesday which ended in a disappointing stalemate. Having put six past the Islanders just three days earlier, more of the same was expected when the two sides clashed again at the Linte Stadium in the capital of Victoria on Tuesday afternoon. However, all the optimism that had surrounded Stuart Baxter’s men quickly turned into the usual frustration as they flattered to deceive once more. Was it complacency? Skipper Hlatshwayo, who along with his Bidvest Wits teammates Buhle Mkhwanazi and Sifiso Hlanti played every minute of the two qualifiers at the back, does not think so. “Obviously looking at how we played in the first match against them at home everyone was expecting us to score a lot of goals,” he said. “We created a lot of chances that we did not convert, Percy’s (Tau) penalty, Lebo (Mothiba) hitting the post and the offside that was on – we just have to move on as a country and a team going forward. He said there were many factors that contributed towards the result, the artificial pitch being one of them. “This is not the time to make excuses, but also the pitch played its role,” he added. “Although we were able to play, we could not quite play our free flowing game.” He said they were now shifting their attention to their next opponents, Nigeria who seem to have hit top form since they last met in Uyo last year. The red hot Super Eagles have swept aside Libya in their back to back games with Odion Ighalo the chief destroyer with 5 goals in the two games. Hlatshwayo continued: “Nigeria are now top of the group and we are playing them next, we know they are a different Nigeria to the one we faced but we have to get the job done.”
