AT 36 years old, not many people would expect  Polokwane City FC captain Jabu Maluleke to reign supreme over his younger counterparts in the Absa Premiership. “To be honest, I don’t dwell much on my age,” said the Soweto-born player after City’s 1-1 draw with SuperSport United in a league encounter at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane, where he was named Man of the Match after another sterling performance. The midfielder started this season in fine form, earning two Man of the Man performances including the one midweek. Many football fans are impressed with the way the former SuperSport and Black Leopards player is maturing like a good wine. “Age is just a number to me,” said Maluleke. “All I want is to continue working hard and enjoy playing football. I am not even thinking of retiring, not yet. I am just taking it one season at a time, let’s see what happens at the end of this season.” He said the younger players in their team had forced him to double his efforts as he fights for his position. City head coach Josef Vukusic seconds Maluleke’s comments about his age: “Jabu is maturing like a good wine. The longer it is left, the more it matures and the better it tastes. “He uses his head like a computer. He is an important player and I hope he continues playing for many seasons. He gives his all to the team in every game. Sometimes you forget he is 36. He plays like he is in his prime.” Asked if he would manage his game-time, Vukusic said: “Jabu is an experienced player, we believe he can manage his own time.” Interestingly, Maritzburg United FC head coach Fadlu Davids is just one year older than Maluleke, while Siyabonga Nomvethe just retired at 40. Hans Vonk only quit when he was on the other side of 40. Commenting on City’s draw with Kaitano Tembo’s charges, the Slovakian mentor, whose team is enjoying a good league run, said a draw was better than defeat. City face Kaizer Chiefs in their next league clash at FNB Stadium on Saturday (6pm).
