CUSTOMERS will now start enjoying rewards for re-using plastic bags called “planet” bags. Both Shoprite and Checkers will supply the 100% recycled and recyclable plastic bags. According to the retailer, the bigger and stronger “planet” bags will retail for R3 each. “Every time a customer re-uses the bag, they get 50c off their grocery purchase. It is 70 microns (compared to the 24 microns for standard 24l plastic bags) and will last for many shopping trips,” the retailer said. The retailor added that changing consumer behaviour by rewarding customers for re-using bags is a critical part of the retailer’s efforts to reduce plastic waste. In 2013 the Shoprite Group became the first South African retailer to introduce recycled and recyclable plastic shopping bags. “In the past year, the Group sold 350 million plastic bags made from 100% post-consumer recycled material, diverting 3 000 tons of plastic from landfill,” the company said in a statement. The company says they are committed to cleaning up the planet while creating new consumer behaviour and saving customers money.
