Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Lucas said she was concerned about officials who continued to spend money the province didn’t have. She was addressing the budget lekgotla on Monday at Mittah Seperepere Convention Centre in Kimberley. The lekgotla was attended by the executive council, head of departments, head of ministries, CEOs and CFOs of the provincial entities. Lucas said: “There is no money. No new money will come into our system. What we have should be used with proper care.” Lucas expressed her appreciation for the efforts by the provincial treasury to assist departments such as health, education and local government to turn things around. Mac Jack, MEC for Finance, Economic Development and Tourism, said drastic measures were needed to tackle unauthorised spending. He said the departments of education as well as sport, arts and culture had made good progress and urged other departments to follow suit. “This would drastically improve the picture for 2019.” Jack said solutions to most of the problems in the departments wouldn’t be solved by just adding resources to the system. “We expect HODs to manage and present options about how some of their problems can be resolved. But we will not throw money at every problem and disregard the consequences, symptoms or origin of these problems,” said Jack.
