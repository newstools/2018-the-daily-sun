THESE residents have warned the police to deal with thugs or they will take matters into their own hands. The people of Kanana in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, made the threat after a man in his late 20s was hit by a taxi on the N2 on Tuesday morning while trying to flee from thugs with knives. Residents said there had been an increase in the number of people robbed while walking along the N2. Street committee member Jacob Ndoro said: “The people doing this are from the community because we see them when they run back to the shacks.” Nokubonga Mkatsitsi said she saw three thugs running away. “We report them but they get bail easily and come back to rob us again,” she said. Langalibalele Hlathuka said most mornings they heard the screams of people running away from thugs. The victim was left with a broken leg and bruises while the taxi driver said he was traumatised as he had never been in an accident before. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said a lane of the highway had to be closed. The police had not responded to queries by the time of going to press.
