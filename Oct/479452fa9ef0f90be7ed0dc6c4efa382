The Hoffenheim fans shouted at the top of their voice. On four occasions the vociferous  bunch let loose as Hoffenheim demolished Stuttgart 4-0 in their Bundesliga fixture here last night. The “tore” goals, came in quick succession, almost as quickly as the fans gathered here for the one-sided, yet pulsating match. With the smooth flow of traffic and the eerie silence, you’d have sworn the Hoffenheim fans were friends and family accompanying a loved one to their final resting place, and not going to a football match. The motor insurance is clearly not a booming business around here with no frequent car crashes. The German drivers seem less aggressive... nothing like the unfriendly bunch from Cape Town. A recent study ranked Cape motorists among the 50 worst drivers globally. Back to the game, the quite atmosphere leading up to the match was no indication of what was to unfold inside the 30 000-seater arena. The audience was spellbound by an attacking brand of football, which followed Emiliano Insua’s early red-card for dangerous tackle on Ishak Belfodil. Referee Frank Willenborg sprinted to the touchline to peek into the screen for video assistance before he could make up his mind. The red card, however, knocked the wind out of Stuttgart’s sails. The home side dominated the 10-man visitors, but it took them 48 minutes to find the breakthrough as Joshua Brenet tapped home for the opener. Joelintino added the second three minutes later, before Belfodil banged in two more. Stuttgart hung on to avoid a massacre as their noisy fans suddenly became mute. Hoffenheim moved to eighth spot as Stuttgart dropped to the bottom of the log.
