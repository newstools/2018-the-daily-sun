THESE four pensioners noticed something worrying among their fellow senior citizens. They could see many elders were affected by age-related diseases, so they decided to prevent it from happening to them and started exercising every day to improve their health. The four, aged from 60 to 65, from Mphakane Village in Botlokwa outside Polokwane, Limpopo call themselves the Botlokwa Masters Athletic team. Chairman Dan Mathe (60) said they believe exercise slows the effects of ageing and gives them a new lease on life. He told Daily Sun many pensioners are affected by age-related illnesses such as cancer or heart disease, just because they lack exercise. “We want to live healthy lives and trust this will help us live longer.” Dan said they jogged at least 15km every morning to keep themselves strong and healthy. He said they formed their group with the aim of encouraging pensioners and youths to exercise for a better life. “Sometimes we also join the local soccer team’s midweek training sessions in the afternoon. It makes us feel young,” he said. “It is sad that children in our communities quit exercising and are struggling to stay healthy.” “It is important to make exercise fashionable in our society and promote a healthy lifestyle,” he said. Matome Mogale (60) said life has become short for the youth, as they have given in to alcohol and drugs. “Exercising and taking part in sport will prevent them from aimlessly roaming the streets, taking drugs or committing crime.” “We will be happy to see youths and pensioners coming on board. “This will help them live a healthy lifestyle and stay fit,” Matome said.
