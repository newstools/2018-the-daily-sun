SAMKELO Bomvu (27) had his dog for nine years. He said his dog, Thando, was a super animal. It chased thugs and he felt safe with him around. But his beloved Thando died last Monday. Instead of leaving the dog’s body at the dump, he chose to give his friend a decent burial. Samkelo wrapped his dog in plastic and dug a grave to bury him. He then put a cross and some flowers on top of the grave. But when passersby saw all this on Thursday, they were convinced someone had been buried there and called the cops. Benoni cops came with sniffer dogs and cameras. Curious community members from Lindelani and Marikana squatter camps near Daveyton, Ekurhuleni gathered around to see for themselves as cops exhumed the “body”. The cops dug up the grave only to find the dog buried there. Samkelo is now angry that his dog was disturbed. “People are always suspicious. There was nothing wrong there. I buried my dog because I loved him,” he said. Community leader Jan Mthimunye said he was notified by the residents about the grave. “It looked like a real grave with a cross on top. We’re relieved cops didn’t find human remains.” Captain Nomsa Sekele said cops were called to Lindelani to check out a grave.
