FOR four weeks, the mum who gave birth in a coma was
unable to move or speak. Then a nurse put her infant son on Amanda di Silva’s
chest. Immediately her heart rate quickened and tears slid down
her cheeks. According to Daily Mail, the 28-year-old Amanda from
Fortaleza, north-east Brazil nearly faced tragedy when she had an epileptic
seizure when she was 37 weeks pregnant. Fearing that the seizure could end the lives of both mum
and child, doctors sedated Amanda. Her son Victor was born by C-section a few days later
last February. Weighing just 2,1 kg, Victor was taken to ICU. But things immediately got complicated for Amanda and
doctors were forced to put her in an induced coma to save her. For weeks, Amanda failed to respond to anything and
medical professionals feared the worst. Then came along the SunHero of the moment - nurse Fabíola
Sá. She suggested putting little Victor on his mum’s chest for the first time
in his young life. Fabíola said: ““As soon as Amanda felt the touch of the
baby's skin on hers, tears started pouring down her cheeks. It was a cry of
love. “More than that it was a cry that said: ‘I'm still here,
I'm alive, I want to live’.” “After 23 days in
a coma her reaction was inexplicable. “We never expected such a quick change and everyone in
the medical team wept with happiness and relief. “We don't have a scientific answer to what happened but
it's evident we should never underestimate the importance of skin-to-skin
contact between mother and child.” Little by little Amanda’s strength returned, and 20 days
after she first held her son, the two were finally able to go home. Amanda does not remember giving birth. “The first thing I
remember was having Victor in my arms, seeing his little head and smelling his
lovely scent. “It was an amazing situation but at the same time
confusing. “I asked my dad if the baby was mine. I put my hand on my
belly and realised I was no longer pregnant.”
