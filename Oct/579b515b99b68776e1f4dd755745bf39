It's Halloween season and there will be a lot of celebrities impressions. We take a look at South African model Blue Mbombo dressing the exact same as American superstar Beyonce. Beyonce wore a beautiful black number earlier this year to the Grammy awards. Blue posted some side by side pictures on her Instagram captioned, "What's your altar ego?" Blue really nailed this look as she wore the exact same thing as Beyonce from the Black hat, Black sunglasses, Silver drop earrings and black strap sandal shoes. See pictures below to see who wore it best: A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Jan 28, 2018 at 10:46pm PST     ...y’all already know I love dressing up and showing up but I must say this was by far my fav dress up and show up for 2018 ???? #halloween2018 #halloweencostume #tsrhalloweenwars #halloweenbeyonce #beyonce #jointhefearless #bloodhotel . . . . .
