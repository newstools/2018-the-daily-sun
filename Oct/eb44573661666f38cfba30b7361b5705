There are now markets
on the twitter streets selling vagina frontals also known as punani wigs. Some men love the idea
and are even asking what kinds of wigs are available. Some want afros, while
others want Brazilian frontals. Sipho Ngobeni was
surprised and said he loves the idea. “As someone’s side
dish, I understand and fully support this initiative. I love mine with hair,
but bae loves it without the bush. This is just perfect. I’m even willing to
buy for my bae,” said Sipho. Meanwhile, Patrick
Langa is completely against this. He said girls are
already faking a lot of things and he is definitely against these vagina
frontals. “They wear fake eye
lashes, fake hair, make-up, fake boobs, fake asses and now this. Girls, you will not
see heaven with all these fake things. I prefer my girl with
whatever she has to offer me. These fake things are manufactured because most
of the girls want to please these boys,” said Patrick. Luyanga Zuma said she
loves these frontals and will definitely buy some. “These look much
better than these scruffy things we have. I love it and will definitely buy
it,” she said.
