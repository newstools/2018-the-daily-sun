TV personality, Lalla Hirayama is one of the most private celebrities in the entertainment industry. Apart from her work on television and the few glimpses of her life shown on her Instagram, not very much is known about her. But her new campaign with Mac Cosmetics has seen her reveal a rather painful memory from her past. Although she is getting paid for the post, the message behind it still resonates with a lot of people. Lalla has revealed that she used to suffer from low self-confidence levels in the past due to very bad skin problems. “I’ve suffered from the worst acne most of my life and although things may have changed I owe it all to @maccosmeticsafrica! That’s kept my confidence up when my skin let me down,” she said. Lalla has become somewhat of a sex symbol in SA but her revealing that she wasn’t always as confident as she is now, has helped a lot of young girls going through similar situations.
