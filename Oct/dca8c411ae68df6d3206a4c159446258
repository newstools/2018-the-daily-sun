GOSPEL star Fikile Mlomo’s music career was soaring on the wings of her angelic voice. But she said it all almost came to a devastating end. Over the past two years, Fikile suffered a miscarriage and lost her voice. She said these obstacles forced her to cry out to God and ask for answers. The answers came in the form of a new single Phendula, from her new album It’s God’s Time. “God revealed to me all that I had done wrong and how to avoid pain in future,” she said. Speaking to the People’s Paper, Fikile said after she suffered a miscarriage in 2016 when she was two months pregnant, she lost her voice. “I was still trying to deal with the pain of losing a baby. Then suddenly, I lost my voice. “I couldn’t speak properly and I couldn’t sing at all. “I first thought that I was suffering from flu, but this thing went on and I started to fear for my career.” She said following her miscarriage, she’s scared to try for another baby. Fikile said she went to various doctors who told her there was an infection in her voice box. “They failed to treat me. At that time I had an album to release and gigs to perform. “I started to ask God if what was happening was some kind of punishment. Losing my voice meant the end of my career.” She added that doctors told her they would have to operate. “But miraculously, my voice came back in July. The song Phendula has been nominated at the Crown Awards for Best Video.”
