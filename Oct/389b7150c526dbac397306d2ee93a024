CPF members were recently shocked when they were only given raincoats and reflector jackets as uniforms by their mayor. The members from Hombe Village in Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape said at first they thought it was a joke when they were given the two items of clothing, with a torch and six whistles. The members were not happy at all, saying they wanted jackets. Ntombekhaya Fosi (42) said: “I don’t want to dwell on this but to be honest, we were not expecting this.” She said she joined the CPF because of the high number of rape incidents in the area. “Criminals are doing what they want, so staying at home and waiting for them doesn’t help anyone,” she said. However, Nondumiso Magawula (46) said the mayor had not shown them respect. “We are disappointed but we have no choice but to take what we are given. “We hope next time they will bring real uniforms and not this joke,” she said. Ndoyisile Makhosonke (62) said she joined the CPF after seeing women were being victimised in their homes. “We want to make the community safe and the fact that we only got raincoats will not discourage us. “We will continue working for our community to make sure it is a safe environment,’ she said. When the SunTeam asked Ingquza Hill mayor Jongintaba Mdingi why the members were only given these items, he said: “This is the first time that we are doing this. “Next time, we will ask what their needs are since they are the ones in the field.” The mayor urged residents to register to vote and to stop starting fires in the veld. “This country depends on you, so make sure you register to vote,” he said.
