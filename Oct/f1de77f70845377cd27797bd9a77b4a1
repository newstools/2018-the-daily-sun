FROM far away these toilets seem clean and well serviced. But in reality, the people of Amatikwe, eThekwini have not been able to use them since January as no water was connected. People told Daily Sun they were really happy when they got flush toilets but have since been forced to start using pit toilets again. Those whose houses are near the toilets carry buckets of water from home so they can flush them. Nomusa Luthuli (63) said she had been given the nickname of webhakede (mother of a bucket). That is because she carried a bucket with her whenever nature called. “My toilet was damaged and I can’t use it, so I was happy when these toilets were installed last year,” Nomusa said. She said even though no water was connected to the toilets, she continued using them. Nomusa Mkhize (45) said the caretaker had reported the matter to the councillor but nothing happened. “We want a toilet that has running water, like people in other areas. “I would really appreciate it if the councillor could intervene. “The toilets are clean for now but if the water problem is not sorted out, they might be vandalised,” Nomusa said. Councillor Wiseman Nyaba said the whole area was affected by a water shortage. “I will meet residents so we can talk about the matter and get it sorted out but the whole area has a water problem,” Nyaba said.
