The first season of The Bachelor South Africa was announced earlier this year and this past Sunday the man whose attention all the ladies will be vying for, was revealed. The 29-year-old model, fitness expert and entrepreneur hails from Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape but has also lived in Pretoria and now resides in Cape Town. He is a former rugby player, having played for the Blue Bulls U19 team as well as the Sharks U21 team. During his high school years at the Pretoria High School for Boys, Lee captained the school’s first team and then went on to captain the Tuks (University of Pretoria) first team. He studied Marketing Management through UNISA and holds a Health & Fitness qualification from the Zululand Sports Academy. He describes himself as ambitious, hardworking, caring, humble, and loyal.  Lee’s modeling work has taken him all over the work, with London and Germany being his favourite places on Earth. His favourite thing to do on weekends is braaing with friends. When the show finally airs next year, 25 ladies will all be competing for his affection over several weeks of the show. At the end of it all, Lee will propose to one lucky lady.
