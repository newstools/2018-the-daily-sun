LORRAINE Biyase (55) from Orlando East, Soweto is an angry woman. Lorraine said she learnt last week that madala Edward was admitted to hospital and treated for a mental disorder, even though he is not mentally ill. She told Daily Sun her dad suffered a stroke seven years ago and it affected his speech. He is on medication but according to Lorraine, her mum Catherine (78) misled the hospital staff to keep her dad away from home. Lorraine said she believed her dad’s stroke was caused by her mum’s abuse. She said she had bad memories of her childhood, when her mum would shout at her father for no reason. “My mum talks to my dad as if he is a child. She even insults him in public and pulls him around by his clothes,” claimed Lorraine. She said the day her father suffered a stroke, she and her husband carried him to the car, while her mother just sat in the lounge. “My dad was bedridden for a while and I had to bath him,” said Lorraine. “I tried family and marriage counselling for us but my mother refused to take part. But still I believe counselling for the entire family might be the solution.” The madala was unable to speak to the Sun Team. Catherine told the People’s Paper she didn’t need counselling. “Lorraine is my child and I raised her well, but she is lying,” she said. “If I’d ever abused my husband, he would have left me a long time ago. “I’m not the cause of his stroke. I was hard on him because he didn’t want to have a bath and that would have made me look bad.” Catherine said she didn’t want to talk to the SunTeam about family matters.
