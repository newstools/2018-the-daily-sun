THE Independent Police Investigative Directorate arrested two cops yesterday. A constable and captain were arrested in connection with the death of a Tshwane University of Technology student Katlego Monareng. Katlego, a third-year law student, was allegedly shot by the police during Student Representative Council elections at the Soshanguve campus in August. At the time, Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said cops were called after an officer was allegedly held hostage and assaulted by students. About 200 students had barricaded the entrance to the campus. Dlamini said the students also stoned police vehicles. “The police reported that they fired at the ground with R5 rifles and that when they left, no one was injured, but police vehicles were damaged. The police were later informed that a student had been shot,” said Dlamini. He said the officers faced murder charges. “Ipid has concluded its investigation and only two technical reports are outstanding,” he said. They will appear in the Soshanguve Magistrates Court today.
