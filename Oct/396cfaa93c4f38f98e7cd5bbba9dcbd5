FARMING has always been Palesa Moahloli’s passion. When she got the chance, the woman from Welkom, Free State, grabbed her chance with both hands. She was recently announced the Free State Female Entrepreneur of Year by the department of sgriculture, forestry and fisheries at the 2018 awards competition. “I am very humbled to be awarded this title. I hope it serves as a testament to my hard work and shows other emerging farmers that perseverance and continued hard work pays off. “I hope to be a role model by encouraging others who are doubtful about farming to make a contribution to our economy,” she said. Palesa obtained a degree in accounting at the University of Lesotho in 1979. She worked in QwaQwa, Thaba Nchu and Bloemfontein as an arts and culture manager in the department of sport, arts and culture in the Free State provincial government. “After retiring, I decided to buy a farm outside Boshof. I farm Brangus and Bonsmara cattle and also recently added a piggery to diversify my farm. “This year I joined the Sernick Emerging Farmers programme. “I was invited to complete the Level 4 national qualification framework in animal production. “The programme has given me a platform to gain first-hand knowledge in the cattle industry, and the chance to network with other emerging farmers,” she said.
