General Khehla John Sitole will officially launch reveal the Amaberete in Westbury on Thursday morning. On Tuesday, Cele made a promise to the gangster troubled community
that he would deploy the Tactical Response Team (TRT). THE TRT also known Amaberete will be dedicated to the
Westbury policing precinct as part of the broader strategy to fight the plague
of drugs and gang-related violence in the area. Cele promised to sweep gangsters and drug dealers off the
streets.Â  . "We want you to sleep peacefully at night," said
Cele. He said that the tactical response and tracking teams, known
as Amaberete, will patrol the streets. The shutdown in Westbury began after a woman was caught in a
crossfire last week Thursday, and was killed. Her 10-year-old daughter was injured during the shoot-out. Cele pleaded with residents to give him 72hrs to arrest the
remaining two suspects in this case. "We have already arrested two of them and we are
looking for the other two," he said.
