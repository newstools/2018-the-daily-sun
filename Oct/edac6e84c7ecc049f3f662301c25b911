THE ANC Women’s League has come in for a tongue lashing from the gender group #TheTotalShutdown. This is after Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane and deputy minister of water and sanitation Pamela Tshwete came to support the women testifying at the Omotoso trial wearing their Women’s League uniforms. The group accused league officials of using gender based violence to their advantage. Spokeswoman Loyiso Saliso said: “The movement is concerned about officials who don’t draw the line between party and state and use matters of gender based violence as their political football. “We appreciate Minister for Women in the Presidency Bathabile Dlamini addressing people about the trial as minister of women in the presidency, but it saddens us to see the communications minister organising a press conference dressed in her full league regalia. “Dlamini made no mention of government’s plans for the coming National Gender Summit. We are in national crisis when it comes to gender based violence, requiring consistent government messaging. “It is concerning to see government officials speaking with forked tongues around gender based violence matters when our women killings are five times the world average. A woman is killed every three hours, raped every 15 minutes and government is driving the war on our bodies as electioneering,” Saliso said. Dlamini said they were preparing for the summit. “Women’s League members supported gender based violence victims and their families through difficult times, whether covered by media or not.”
