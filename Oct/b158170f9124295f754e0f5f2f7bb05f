ALL hell broke loose at a cop shop on Monday when a crowd
of angry parents stormed it with 45 children, all of whom were possessed by
demons. According to Daily Monitor, the drama unfolded at Budaka
Central Police station in the east of Uganda. The kids, all of whom attend Kebula Primary School, had
apparently been bewitched. Their parents suspected the evil culprit to be a female
Kenyan sangoma, currently imprisoned in the cop shop’s cells. Parent Moses Kamya described his daughter’s demonic
behaviour. “Sometimes she could walk like a snake and make very
strange sounds. Her school mates as well started to make funny noise, crying
out loudly while at school and this prompted us to suspect one of the witchdoctors
to be behind all this.” Despite their most powerful prayers, the parents were
helpless to expel the demons. Their despair drove them to storming the cop shop to
force the woman believed to be behind the black magic to remove her demons. But cops were extremely irritated that the violent
parents had made the demons their problem. Even more irritating for Budaka District Police
Commander, Wilson Salaam, was that he was forced to drive the entire group of parents
and kids back to the school. Luckily, a brief investigation revealed the real source
of the evil. “With the help of local witchdoctors, we discovered that
some traditional herbs had been planted in the school. The person responsible
had the intention of extorting money from the school administration before
calming the situation. Fortunately, the pupils’ demons were cast out and they
resumed their normal lessons,” Salaam said. Relieved principal, Gusta Mukwenda, said it was the first
time his school had experienced such horror. “Religious leaders tried to conduct prayers at the school
but the situation kept escalating. This prompted the community to mobilise
themselves and do things their way,” he said.
