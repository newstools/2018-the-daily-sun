THE Richmond Municipality has opened a case of trespassing against suspended municipal manager Bongiwe Mnikathi. Mnikathi allegedly arrived at the municipal offices on Tuesday with heavily armed bodyguards and broke into her own office. She was suspended earlier this month after failing to attend council meetings. Municipal spokesman Sibonelo Bhengu said: “She arrived with seven armed bodyguards and broke into her office. “She claimed the council’s decision to suspend her was invalid.” He said Mnikathi’s trespassing had caused chaos at the offices and cops were called in to arrest her. “Police negotiated with her and asked her to leave the premises, which she did,” said Bhengu. Deputy mayor Khonziwe Mkhize said one of the reasons Mnikathi was suspended was that she arrived at a council meeting on 28 September with armed men. She allegedly insisted that they be allowed into the chamber. When Daily Sun contacted Mnikathi, she said she would comment later as she was still receiving advice on the matter. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of malicious damage to property was opened at Richmond cop shop.
