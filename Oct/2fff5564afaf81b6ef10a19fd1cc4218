DA CHIEF whip John Steenhuisen wants Black First Land First banned from parliamentary meetings. The party caused chaos during the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs sitting yesterday. “I will write to the Speaker of the National Assembly to ask that the matter be investigated,” Steenhuisen said. Party members allegedly tried to shove businessman Nicky Oppenheimer and his son Jonathan when they appeared before the committee. The Oppenheimers were summoned to parliament to explain how their company, Fireblade Aviation, managed to operate a private terminal at OR Tambo International Airport. Party spokesman Lindsay Maasdorp said: “These people can spread lies. “We know the Oppenheimers met the ANC. “They asked to have a private terminal to illegally take diamonds out of our country.”
