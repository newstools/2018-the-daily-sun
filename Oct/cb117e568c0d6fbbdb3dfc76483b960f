RESIDENTS of Emathokwaneni in Nongoma, northern KZN, said they are putting their faith in Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe. Mantashe visited the area on Friday to listen to residents’ concerns about Zululand Anthracite Colliery mine. Resident Qhwaga Mbhele (40) said: “All our rivers have gone dry because of this mine. “Coal mining had a negative impact on our rivers. “We lost lots of livestock as we did not have enough water for the animals to drink.” He claimed the mine’s machines caused their houses and soil to crack. Another resident, Simon Miya (49), said: “When the mine started its operations here, we were told it was going to hire locals through recommendations from traditional leaders and councillors. “But that never happened. “They are using the CV system, which leaves us behind and gives job opportunities to people from outside our neighbourhood.” Bradley Hammond, the mine’s chief operating officer, said: “The only time someone from outside the area is hired is when we fail to find a certain skill in the area.” When he was asked about the drying rivers, he said: “There are rivers many kilometres away from the mine that are also drying up. The area has been very dry for the past three years. It’s not a result of mining.” He said the mine used its own resources to extract, treat and supply water to four communities. Regarding the cracked houses and soil, Hammond said: “We don’t use equipment that can have that effect. “We are an underground mine and do not interrupt the surface.” Mantashe said the department would look into the residents’ complaints and come up with a solution.
