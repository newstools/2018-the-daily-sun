Local rapper AKA has revealed that he will be releasing "many" more albums, despite suggesting his latest, Touch My Blood might be his last. READ: AKA’S NEXT ALBUM COULD BE HIS LAST! AKA is known to tweet a lot and many of his tweets often get people talking. He has had his fair share of Twitter meltdowns and it is safe to say that sometimes he doesn’t mean what he tweets. He is also not afraid to have a bit of fun social media. So when he announced on Twitter that Touch My Blood was so good, it might just be his last album, many did not believe him. However, The Supa Mega was almost adamant that he would call it a day after this album, claiming he would only release singles. In hindsight, it appears the Fela in Versace hit-maker was just stirring up publicity ahead of his album’s release – a trick that worked wonders since the album went gold after only one week. AKA, real name Kiernan Forbes, also revealed that he is back in a “partnership” with his old record label Vth Season and Sony Music Africa. “With the size of my dreams and size of my brand - I need people who are experts in the record industry,” he said.
