The African Fashion International’s Joburg Fashion Week is drawing to a close today with a bang. It’s been a good of fashion, celebrity, parties and luxury at its finest. And it will all culminate with a spectacular show by David Tlale this afternoon. David will put on his show in memoriam of Nelson Mandela’s 100th centenary celebrations by showing 100 garments on 100 models. And then, of course all of our faves with head to the official after party. But before all of that, check out who wore what to which show: ?????#afijfw #afijfw2018 ?? @makeup_anna_lorraine ????‍?? @kudatot_hair A post shared by  Nti Ramaboa (@chef_nti) on Oct 6, 2018 at 8:19am PDT  Came out to support the very talented @tsotetsikl as he unveils his 2018 collection for @afi_sa themed Unscripted Wounds, depicting the stories of the women kept in jail that never get a chance to tell their story. For the location he chose Constitutional Hill as his apt venue to tell his story. Inspiring collection Khothatso. #AFIJFW A post shared by  Basetsana Kumalo (@basetsanakumalo) on Oct 7, 2018 at 4:29am PDT  Africa is in me. She is forever with me, in all her glory. She’s there when I wake up each morning, her love gently easing me into the day and she’s there when I go to sleep, head on the pillow next to mine. It’s no surprise then that she was with me at @afi_sa #AFIJFW #AFIJFW2018. I celebrate her with this dress by @quiteria_george and my choice of natural hair, inspired by Afrocentric ponytail Styled by @lucys_beautysalon .
