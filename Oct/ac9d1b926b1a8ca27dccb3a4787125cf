THE ANC’s Nelson Mandela Bay branches want the disbanded regional committee to pack up and go. Last week, the provincial executive committee disbanded the regional committee. This was due to the failure to convene a regional general council meeting to elect a chairman, as well as failure to meet 70% of branches on good terms. But the axed leaders refuse to leave Florence Matomela House, the party’s regional offices in Port Elizabeth. On Sunday, a meeting at Nangoza Jebe Hall in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, meant to brief branches about the PEC’s decision to dissolve the regional leadership, turned violent. Two men fired shots into the ceiling and fled. Captain Andre Beetge said: “Police are searching for two gunmen who allegedly fired shots outside the entrance to the hall. They fired more shots into the celling. No one was injured during the incident.We suspect the aim was to disrupt an ANC meeting.” The party’s branch chairman, Wandisile Jikeka, said: “Forty branches in this region support the PEC’s decision. Those who said they would appeal the decision had no mandate to do so. “People behind the shooting have been circulating threats by SMS and on social media but we are not intimidated. We want police to investigate and arrest all those behind the shooting.” The phone of former regional secretary Themba Xathula, who last week said they would appeal the decision, was off, while regional spokesman Mtika Mandlavu did not answer his phone when the SunTeam phoned them for comment.
