MPUMALANGA treasury officials affiliated to Nehawu are calling for the removal of the head of department, Nombhedesho Nkamba. The marchers accused her of not having a clearance certificate and destabilising the department. They also demanded the appointment of a new MEC, saying the current one appeared to be too busy to listen to their demands. The officials marched to the provincial government offices to hand over a memorandum to the acting premier, Gillion Mashego, on Wednesday. The officials have been on a go slow for a month and said they felt that their issues were not being attended to. Nehawu chairwoman in the department, Nontsikelelo Gabela, said when Nkamba was appointed head of department, she wasn’t vetted, as required by law. “We wonder how she was appointed to the position when she was not vetted. She is holding a key post in the department. “We will give them space to act on our memorandum.” The memorandum was received by Mashego, who said they would look at the issues raised in it and respond within seven working days. Mashego appealed to workers to return to their jobs.
