A MEMORIAL service for four people who burnt to death last month was held in Philippi, Cape Town, on Tuesday night. No one knows what started the fire in which Nomsa Dyantyi (38) and her children Vuyani (10), Neliswa (7) and Aphelele (4) died at Tshatshalaza squatter camp on 17 September. Daily Sun published the sad story on 19 September and again last week when the father of the three kids, Zibele Mjila, pleaded for help to do DNA tests so he could bury them. Thozamile Liwani (39) said: “It wasn’t easy but we had to make sure they’re buried and for the surviving family members to heal.” The community helped by donating money. Businesses such as the Cata Taxi Association, Dali Bottle Store, Midas and Lucky from One Up Centre also helped. “We’ll forever be thankful to everyone who responded when we needed help,” said Thozamile. “Even though we can’t mention all of them, we appreciate the contribution.” Zibele said: “I wouldn’t have managed to handle this alone. “I needed all the help and support that I got from them, and I’ll forever be grateful. “I still want two know what started the fire that killed my family.” He suspected that an electricity box caused the fire. Neighbour Thobeka Ngongobeni (53) still couldn’t believe the Dyantyis had died. She said they had been fires before, but they had never lost anyone and the fire that killed the Dyantyis was different. “We tried everything to help them but the fire was too strong,” said Thobeka. The funeral will take place in Mvumelwano Village in Qumbu, Eastern Cape, on Saturday.
