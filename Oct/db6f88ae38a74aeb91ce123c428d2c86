ABOUT 1 000 backyarders were left homeless after the City of Cape Town demolished their shacks in Kraaifontein on Tuesday afternoon. Some of the backyarders left for work in the morning, only to find their belongings, including beds and TVs, piled under the ruins of broken shacks when they returned. “We have nowhere to go because we’ve already parted ways with the mastandis,” said Ntulwana Nowiza (37). “I can’t go back there because the shack I was renting has already been occupied.” The backyarders, who have only been living on the land for five days, stoned cars and threatened to loot shops in retaliation on Wednesday morning. “We are not going to take this inhumane treatment towards us lying down! We will take revenge,” said a backyarder. “We want to know where we should go, now that they have destroyed our shacks. We don’t have homes!” said another backyarder. “They have destroyed our shacks and our belongings. The backyarders claim the land they occupied was bush. Community leader Asanda Sipondo (34) said: “More than 1 000 people have been left homeless. “There are small babies among the people. There was no notice that our shacks would be demolished.” Asemahle Sizane (17) said: “I lost everything. My books and school uniform were all in the shack.” MMC for safety and security JP Smith said the Wallacedene Clinic had to be closed because of the violence on Wednesday. Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said four people were arrested for public violence, two for house robbery and arson, and nine for being in possession of suspected stolen goods.
