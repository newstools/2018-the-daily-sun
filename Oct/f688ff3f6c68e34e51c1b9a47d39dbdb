A TEACHER was nabbed yesterday morning after she allegedly slammed a 10-year-old pupil’s head on a desk. The alleged incident took place last Monday. The mother of the pupil (36) from Maraisburg, Joburg said her son, who attends a primary school in Westdene, came to her workplace with cuts on his mouth. “When his transport dropped him off, I realised he had some blood on his mouth,” said the mum. “I opened a case and went to the school the following day. “The principal acted as though he was shocked, but I didn’t believe his reaction because it was apparently not the first time this teacher has beaten up a child.” Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said the teacher was arrested yesterday. “A case of assault was opened against her. She will appear in court soon,” said Masondo. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “Our psycho-social unit will be sent to the school to offer support to the victim and all those affected by the alleged incident. “The matter will be referred to the South African Council of Educators for further investigation. We condemn any form of assault on pupils.”
