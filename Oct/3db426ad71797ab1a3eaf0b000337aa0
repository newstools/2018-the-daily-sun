A MADALA from Claremont in Cape Town has won R41 million in the Powerball quick pick. The 66-year-old, who was accompanied by his two daughters to the Ithuba offices in Sandton, Joburg yesterday, said he always had faith he would win big one day. “I was down and out and my doctors said I only had three days to live. “That was two years ago, but I’m still alive,” said madala. “I have a heart condition and a hole in my heart. I stopped taking my medication because I believe God is keeping me alive for a reason.” He said his house burnt down in 2013 and he’s been renting ever since. He told Daily Sun he was planning to build a house for himself and his wife. “I want to build a house for me and my wife. She has even started shopping for furniture. “I’ll also build houses for all my four kids near my home. I want us to be neighbours,” he said. Madala’s youngest daughter said her dad called her on the day of the draw to tell her he had a feeling he would win. “He always calls when he feels he has won something. Even when it’s a small amount of money, he always gets a feeling he’ll win. Finally, he won big this time. “Now we’ve got to look out for our dad because people might take advantage of his kindness.” She said people knew he has won the Powerball and are already asking for money. “People are happy that he won because he’s kind,” she said. “They say he deserves it because he’s been through a lot. “So if we are not careful, he’ll spend his money on all these people.”
