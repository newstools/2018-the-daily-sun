THE residents of Engonyameni outside Umlazi, south of Durban, are back on the streets. The residents blocked Mangosuthu Highway in the early hours of yesterday morning to demand water. They said they haven’t had any water since last week. The residents said their water was cut off last Wednesday and that no one explained to them why that happened. One of the people who took part in the protest said they were sick and tired of excuses from eThekwini Municipality. “They always say they are fixing the problem. How long must we live without water? “The municipality doesn’t care about us and our health. There are schools in the area. “Our kids and teachers need water,” said the man. A grader in one of the yards in the area was burned. Khombi Maphumulo (57) said the grader was parked in her yard by a contractor working on the roads in the area. She said they didn’t see who burned it. She said they only realised in the morning that it had been burned. Ccouncillor Mbuyiseni Mkhize said it wasn’t true that water had not been available since last week. He said he was called on Monday by people who reported to him that there was no water. He said while he was trying to fix the problem, the residents began to protest. Last month, the village came to a standstill when the residents blockaded Mangosuthu Highway for a whole week. They burned the traditional court and shut down the schools.
