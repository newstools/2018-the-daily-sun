STEVEN Letsebe (43) is fuming after he was allegedly racially abused and called the k-word. To make matters worse, he claimed, the cops had no idea how to handle the matter. Steven from Mamelodi East, Tshwane, saidthe incident happened on Friday. He was delivering concrete at a Mams Mall construction site. The guards on duty apparently showed him where to offload the concrete but a mlungu wouldn’t let him. “He came running towards me and said he had always suspected all k*****s were dumb,” he said. Steven apparently asked the man why he was insulting him. “He told me I deserved it and that I’m a filthy k*****r,” he said. Steven went to the Mamelodi East Police Station to open a case. “I told the cop at the charge office what had happened,” he said. Steven was shocked when the policeman asked him what case he should open. “He said the case was confusing and advised me to go to the media.” Despite reporting him to his superiors, the mlungu has apparently not been fired. “Chances are he’s seen that there are no consequences for calling people the k-word and will continue doing it.” Police spokesman Michael Mbewe said: “He should have asked for a supervisor or the station commander.”
