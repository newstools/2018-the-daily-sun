The department of sport footed the bill for this year’s Legends Marathon, which took place in East London on Sunday. Sport MEC Bulelwa Tunyiswa said the marathon was launched in 2013. “This marathon is one of the fastest growing road running events in South Africa. “It celebrates the legendary spirit of the people in the Eastern Cape. “One of the reasons this marathon was created was to promote unity,” she said. R500 000 was up for grabs. The race attracted many high-profile athletes from around South Africa as well as neighbouring countries such as Zimbabwe and Kenya. The 68km men’s race was won by Mike Fokoroni (41) from Zimbabwe. He walked away with R50 000. He told Daily Sun it was the first time he’d taken part in the race. “I’m very proud of myself, but I’m disappointed because the prize money was reduced. “First place used to be worth R120 000, but it’s dropped to R50 000. “But I won’t complain because maybe some of the sponsors pulled out of the event. “I will join the race again next year to defend my title,” he said. The 68km women’s race was won by Jennifer Koech (39) from Kenya. “I spent three months preparing for this marathon,” she said. “If you want to achieve something, you have to work hard. “It wasn’t easy but I managed to win.”
