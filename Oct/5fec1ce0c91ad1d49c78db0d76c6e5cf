House music heavyweights Black Motion and Mo Flava have decided to put an end to their “beef”. The feud began when the pair, Smol (real name Thabo Mabongwane) and Murder (real name Robert Mohosana) pulled a no-show on Mo Flava after he booked them for a show in 2016. However, speaking to DJ Fresh on the Metro FM Breakfast Show, Black Motion explained that they had a traditional ceremony on the day – causing them to miss the show. They claimed Mo Flava refused to understand their reason for pulling out and gave them the “cold shoulder.” While it appeared Mo Flava and Black Motion would not come to a resolution at the time, despite the best efforts of DJ Fresh, things took a turnaround a few days later when they were booked to perform at the same gig. They decided to let bygones be bygones as Mo Flava approached the duo after his performance to bury the hatchet. He later shared the video on social media which showed him going on stage to greet the duo as they performed. Fans were quick to commend the act on social media.
