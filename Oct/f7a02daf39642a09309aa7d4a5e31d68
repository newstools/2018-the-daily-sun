AFTER a long struggle, residents of Makosha B Village can finally drink clean water. They have had no water, despite living near Nsami Dam. But that is all in the past, as Limpopo Premier Stanley Mathabatha officially opened the water project in the village outside Giyani on Sunday. While some residents could buy water, poor people had to travel far to fetch it. Mathabatha told Daily Sun the new project is a sign that soon water scarcity in the province will be a thing of the past. “It is in our hands as government to ensure our people have access to drinkable water, as we promised.” He said they are worried that water scarcity remains a serious challenge for their communities. “We believe this project will go a long way to reduce the water delivery backlog in the district. “It always is our wish to see our people with access to clean and drinkable water, regardless of where they live. “We call on our residents to take care of water resources, to ensure they no longer experience water challenges in their villages,” the premier said. Mopani mayor Nkakareng Rakgoale said the municipality has been working hard all along to ensure its people get drinkable water. “We urge our residents to be patient. Together with Lepelle Northern Water and the water and sanitation department, we are working hard to find a lasting solution to the water challenges in our district. “We pride ourselves as the municipality on finally handing over this water project after the long struggle our residents had to face,” Rakgoale said.
