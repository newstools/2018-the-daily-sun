MUHLUPHEHI Manganyi (75) from Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga said his name means “a poor person”. Now he believes that’s the reason he never got his Road Accident Fund payout. The madala said he was involved in a car crash while he was still working at a mine in 2002. He got injured when the taxi he was travelling in crashed head-on with another vehicle. Muhluphehi said the incident left his right hand badly hurt. “I was admitted to hospital for two months and the doctor said I should lodge a claim at the RAF. “I consulted more than three lawyers in 2003, but I never got any help,” said madala. “When I heard that RAF would be having an outreach programme in Thulamashe, I thought my problem would be addressed. But I was told my claim had expired.” Sello Masotho, a regional marketing manager at RAF, said: “We face similar cases like the one of Manganyi, where their claims have expired. Once three years has passed, a claim is considered expired.” He said if the case was handled by the RAF forensics, they would only guide the person about the process of putting together a statement and sending it to the Law Society of South Africa. He said the society would then handle the matter. On Saturday, RAF conducted an outreach programme in Thulamashe, Bushbuckridge. The aim was to assist accident victims with RAF-related cases. Masotho said they did not only bring services to the people, but also came to warn people about fraud and corruption regarding RAF matters. Masotho said having a lawyer was a person’s legal right. “But a claimant can still claim directly at the RAF without using the services of a lawyer,” he said.
