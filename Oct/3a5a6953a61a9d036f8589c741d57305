THE bail application for seven people accused of killing their chief continued in Mbizana Magistrates Court on Friday. Dindini villagers are facing charges of murder and malicious damage to property. Chief Thulani Mjanyelwa was stabbed and set alight not far from his home in August. On Friday, accused number one, David Sogoni (55) took the stand to give reasons for wanting bail. Sogoni is accused of leading people to the chief’s homestead after a community meeting. He told the court he has high blood pressure, arthritis and cramp in his feet. He showed his hands to the court, which he said swelled from time to time. “As a result of being in jail, my condition has worsened. “I have been to hospital twice already. “I have difficulty waking up early to be counted because the cramp is painful,” he said. Sogoni did not deny leading people to the chief’s home. “After I got the brief about the meeting’s resolution, I took responsibility for leading the people,” he said. He told the court many people were at the meeting and the number grew as they headed for Mjanyelwa’s home. “On our way there, more people from the village who were not at the meeting joined in.” The bail application was postponed to Wednesday.
