FORMER Eastern Cape education MEC Mandla Makupula was buried on Saturday. The service was held at Abbotsford Christian Centre in East London. He died on 7 October at Life St Dominic’s Hospital in East London after a long illness. People came in large numbers to pay their last respects, including MPs and ministers Gugile Nkwiti, Thulas Nxesi, Gwede Mantashe, Buti Manamela, Angie Motshekga and Blade Nzimande. Motshekga said Makupula was one of a kind. “He served the people of this country with dignity,” she said. “He turned around a department that had been placed under administration, and under his leadership the matric class of 2017 improved the Eastern Cape matric results by 5,7% to 65%. “I want to say to him, ‘Goodbye teacher, thinker, philosopher and comrade’. We thank his family for sharing Makupula with us.” Nzimande, speaking on behalf of the tripartite alliance, said Makupula belonged to the generation that built the SACP. The late MEC was a communist. “Makupula leaves us during the task of rebuilding our movement. Our alliance is very weak. He left while he was rebuilding the department. He died with his boots on.” Makupula’s daughter Mbali said her father lived a simple life. “He was a best friend to his children. He gave us better education,” she said. A message from his wife Mzubanzi was read by a family member. “If I can describe the pain I’m feeling about the departure, I can say it’s like I have been cut in half, alive. “I release you, my husband. You’ve done your job. You loved me and my children. You were a patriot but never forgot your family.”
