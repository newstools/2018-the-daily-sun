THE Ndamase royal family is very disappointed in President Cyril Ramaphosa. This is because he did not show up for the coronation of AmaMpondo King Ndamase Ndlovuyezwe Ndamase at Nyandeni Great Place in Libode, near Mthatha yesterday. Family spokesman Nkosi Zwelivumile Zoyisile said the president was on the programme and he had not given them notice that he would not attend. Traditional affairs MEC Fikile Xasa said Ramaphosa had received a letter from the lawyers of King Zanozuko Sigcau, threatening to sue him if he attended. This is because the Nhlapo Commission named Sigcau the king of all the AmaMpondo. National House of Traditional Leaders chairman Nkosi Sipho Mahlangu said they supported both kings. Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle apologised for the absence of Ramaphosa and Traditional Affairs Minister Zweli Mkhize. Ndlovuyezwe Ndamase called on the kingâ€™s subjects from Ngqeleni, Libode and Port St Johns not to be angry with Ramaphosa or Mkhize, since they were not able to attend due to circumstances beyond their control.
