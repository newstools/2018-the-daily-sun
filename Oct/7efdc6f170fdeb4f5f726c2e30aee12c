MOST people trust cops, but the Dlaminis recently had a different experience. According to the family from Eshowe, northern KZN, they were left R7 900 poorer after a midnight raid of their spaza shop on 26 September! Nelisiwe Dlamini (54) said the cops claimed they were searching for illegal firearms. “They went to my bedroom and asked me to leave because they wanted to conduct a search and speak to my husband,” said Nelisiwe. “While some of them were taking my husband to his car, others continued searching our bedroom.” The cops then searched the Dlamini’s spaza shop. “When they were done, they asked me to check that nothing was missing,” she said. “I discovered the safe in our bedroom, which contained R4 000, wasn’t there. “We also checked the spaza shop and R2 940 was gone.” She said her husband’s wallet had R1 000 in it and was gone. “They said they would search each other once they got to their cars but never came back,” she said. They opened a case of theft after they phoned the police station and were told no cops had been sent to their house. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a case of theft was opened. “We encourage the family to talk to the investigating officer for progress on the investigation,” she said.
