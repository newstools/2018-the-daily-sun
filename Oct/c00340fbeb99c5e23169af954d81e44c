Our Perfect Wedding host, Kayise Ngqula has finally given birth to her first son and she is loving every moment of it. The TV star is on the November cover of Mamas & Papas magazine in which she talks about what was the “perfect pregnancy” for her. In a candid Instagram post, Kayise shared a little about why the journey to mother has been so perfect. “This was indeed my PERFECT pregnancy” right from that red strip on the pregnancy test that confirmed my suspicion right up until the moment I first laid eyes on my precious gift of a son,” she said. She went on to say that while she was busy working to carving a successful career for herself, life came through and gave her the ultimate role. “I got prepared for the role of a lifetime and I am eternally grateful! He’s the most beautiful human being I’ve ever seen! I’m really at a loss for words,” she went on. Kayise appears semi-nude on the cover of Mamas & Papas, a move she says, was a moment of self-discovery for her. “Thank you for capturing me in a light that pushed me to channel the kind of beauty I didn’t know I had,” she said. The magazine, which is Kayise’s first magazine cover, is available on newsstands right now. God Almighty.... I give all praises unto You!
