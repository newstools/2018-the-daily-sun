Today marks the first memorial of the late Motswako rapper HHP was held at the Newton Music Factory in Johannesburg. HHP's ex fiance Lerato Sengadi shared very touching words for her love. Although Lerato refers to HHP as her Husband in her speech, it was reported this morning from the Tsambo family that 'Ms Sengadi is not, and was never married to Jabulani. She is not his wife!"

I loved you when you didn't love yourself, I loved you when you didn't deserve to be loved, I loved you when others thought you were unloveable...I loved you through happiness and pain, Highs and lows, darkness and light, fear and pride..." She adds with great sad emotion, "... Rest Motho wakha, I know you will come visit me in my dream often,I know you will never leave me, you never have, I will see you in the next lifetime but for now Aluta Continua, Amen."
