ALL Lydia Lebepe wished for when she was in matric was to attend her matric dance and a number of donors made her dream come. Lydia’s story broke the internet last year when dozens of people donated money, clothes, shoes and make-up so she could attend her matric dance. This after her mum Nomsa Nkosi wrote to a radio station asking for help for her daughter. Now the kindhearted 19-year-old and Nomsa (38) want other needy kids to feel the same joy Lydia did. The duo have started a foundation and will be helping not one but 10 kids from their kasi of Tembisa in Ekurhuleni. The Lydia Lebepe Foundation was all about donating and making the dreams of the needy possible. Speaking to Daily Sun, Lydia said they have selected a school in her kasi. “We decided to start donating dresses, shoes and free make-up to pupils from Phomolong Secondary School. “We have already selected those we are going to donate to and will bless them on Friday,” she said. Nomsa said she was proud to have a daughter like Lydia. “The reason we are working together to make other kid’s dreams come true is because Joburg united and helped her when she was in need. “We hope God blesses the foundation so we can continue to do great for others,” said Nomsa. She said her daughter’s good heart had led to them getting blessings. “Lydia thinks about other people when she is in need. “She will go far because of her big heart,” she said. SunBuzz editor Lerato Matsoso was touched by Lydia’s story and came on board to help. “I got 10 dresses so far and there are more in the pipeline. “Support from the public, friends and celebs has been amazing,” she said. The donations of dresses and shoes came from designer Antherline, Aya Mugoni and Sivuyise Zingqi. “I am proud of Lydia. “She is a smart young girl who did not let poverty define her. And I admire the fact that she is helping other kids,” said Lerato.
