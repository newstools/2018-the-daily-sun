After fasting for 40 days, life coach and apostle Boniface Guejiofor wrote a book. The 40-year-old, originally from Nigeria but now living in Goodwood, Cape Town, has released Life Alignment, which apparently sold over 1 000 copies on the first day. The father of two said: “It was inspired by the passion to liberate the sons and daughters of Africa from the pain of poverty and to lead them into their wealthy place, because I believe every man is created rich. “We are looking to create a world without poverty and lack. “I believe in my dream. “With the principles in this book, we can raise up to a million Christocentric billionaires.” Guejiofor said he doesn’t just want to create people who misuse money but who produce wealth for a purpose. Apostle Khaya Mayedwa, who has bought the book, speaks well of Guejiofor. “He is a man of God and we will be praying with him that his dream comes true.” Stephen Osador said his life was transformed after reading the book. “It has life keys which help you understand why you were born. You will realise there is a genius in you.” The life coach said the book must reach every corner of Africa. “I believe in miracles but what Africa needs is the foundation of wealth creation. When you receive a miracle, you have to learn how to turn it into sustainable wealth.” Guejiofor said he will travel around Africa to teach people to create wealth. “Every man created by God is created rich and you begin your journey to wealth creation when you identify the wealth you carry. I call it dancing to your song of destiny.”
