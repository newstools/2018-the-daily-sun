IT’S crucial that we encourage our youth to take sport seriously as it will benefit their health. These were the words of Kgoshi Ngoako Malebogo. He was speaking at the Malebogo tournament closing ceremony held at Sikiding Stadium in Bochum outside Polokwane, Limpopo. Several local soccer and netball teams took part in the tournament. Malebogo told Daily Sun it was worrying that so many young people did no sport. “We believe that taking part in sport benefits young people’s health and helps them stay away from things such as drugs and alcohol,” said Malebogo. He said crime in his area was on the rise because the youth did not take part in sporting activities. “Fighting crime in society is everyone’s business. We should also work with cops to tackle criminal activities in our area. “We also believe that with such tournaments, we can produce quality players for the national teams.” Abel Rakoma, chairman of the Capricorn South African Football Association, urged community leaders and business people to support young people who are interested in sport. “We are a winning nation and working together will assist us to build a good future and build up quality players,” said Rakoma. “We want to see our provincial soccer teams playing in professional leagues.”
