Acclaimed rapper, Nasty C is considering taking his Ivyson Tour to Swaziland. The rapper is currently on the tour, which debuted in Durban on the 6th of October. The tour then moved to Johannesburg this past weekend, 20 October at Melrose Arch where the City of Gold received him with open arms. He has now announced that he would like to take the tour to the Kingdom of Swaziland. In fact, he says he feels like they need it. But he will have to make a decision and act fast because only three cities remain before the tour draws to a close. The Ivyson Tour, a dedication to Nasty Câ€™s late mother Ivy, will still visit Bloemfontein at the Ekhayeni Lounge on 09 November, Windhoek, Namibia on 24 November and finally, Castle of Good Hope in Cape Town on 30 November.
