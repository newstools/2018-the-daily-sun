BIDVEST Wits youngster Haashim Domingo is on a mission to ensure football fanatics know of his prowess. Not many fans will be familiar with the 23-year-old former Ajax Cape Town youth midfielder, but he’s determined to change that. He chose the Clever Boys because he considers them a team with the potential to fight for titles. The talented midfielder also hopes to knock on Bafana Bafana’s door. Domingo made a great start to his Clever Boys stint, scoring one goal for the Absa Premiership pacesetters, and hopes they go all the way and win the league title. He played for the Ajax youth team for 11 years before moving to Victoria Guimaraes’ reserve team in Portugal for two-and-a-half seasons. Said Domingo: “I decided to come back to South Africa because I feel people here don’t know much about me. I last played in Mzansi at the Under-19 Bayhill tournament with Ajax before my move to Europe. “I also want to get into the national team. A team like Wits offers me the opportunity to earn a Bafana call-up. “I aim to fight for the league and in cup competitions, and I know I’ve joined a good team.” Domingo said the PSL had grown to become more competitive than it was when he left for Europe. When coach Gavin Hunt approached him to join the Students, he didn’t think twice. His best game so far was when Wits defeated Orlando Pirates 1-0 at Orlando Stadium. He was on the score sheet and earned the Man of the Match award. “I feel at home here and know that with hard work I will go places. Coach Gavin believes in me and pushes me hard at training. I’m focused on helping the team get more points. I’m happy with the start I’ve made.”
