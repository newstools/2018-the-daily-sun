While some fans can only dream of going on a date with their celeb crushes – one fan is turning that into reality. When TV and radio presenter Sizwe Dlomo decided to dare one of his fans to get a thousand retweets and he would take her on a date, he must have underestimated the power of Black Twitter. It was all started by a tweet from Sizwe about Will and Jada Pinkett Smith “sleeping with other people.” A fan, who goes by the name Mbali on Twitter, turned that into an opportunity to get with her crush. “Do you want to sleep with me?” she asked Sizwe, who did not seem too sure about that. The fan, not to be deterred, then suggested they go out on a date. Sizwe agreed, provided the fan got a thousand retweets first. Fast forward a few days, retweets are in the bag courtesy of Black Twitter and it is now Sizwe’s turn to fulfill his end of the deal. “Okay cool... I’m a man of my word. Where do you stay? Where do you want to go?” he asked the lucky fan. Check out the tweets below:
