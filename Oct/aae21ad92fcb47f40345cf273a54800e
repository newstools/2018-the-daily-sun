AFTER four suspects were bust for the murder of Jan Ramoshaba (24), residents expected quick justice. But when the suspects were released on Tuesday on free bail as cops couldn’t find evidence to link them to the murder, anger turned to rage. That same afternoon the community went on the rampage and burned down the suspects’ family houses in Mankgaile Village, outside Mankweng in Limpopo. Rufus Kgatle (56) said he watched helplessly as the mob torched his brother’s house. “They accused his son and three others of being involved in a fight with the dead man but burning these houses was a bad idea because the court didn’t find them guilty. “As a family we were willing to sit down with the bereaved family over what happened. They burned the whole house down, including our expensive furniture. My nephew and I survived the attack after we were pelted with stones when we tried to move our car.” Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the suspects were released on bail. With regard to the four arson attacks, Ngoepe said seven suspects had been arrested so far and that they would appear in the Mankweng Magistrates Court today. Headman Makopa Malepo (58) said: “I’m so disappointed that people burn houses. “In these matters we should all sit down and find a better solution. “I couldn’t sleep on Tuesday because four families had no shelter.”
