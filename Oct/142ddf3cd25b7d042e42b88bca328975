RESIDENTS of Siyahlala squatter camp in Chris Hani extension 1, Ekurhuleni, woke up to a sea of red on Thursday. When the Red Ants and Metro cops arrived at about 6am, the first thing they did was stand by and watch the residents. But by 9am chaos had erupted as the Red Ants descended on the shacks, destroying everything in their path. Ntomi Hlala (30), who moved to the area five months ago, said: “All my furniture was flattened. The only belongings I have left are the clothes on my back. “My kids were supposed to go back to school next week, but their education will be put on hold until we get back on our feet.” Community leader Cecilia Mnyatheli said the problem started when people built on land they agreed not to occupy. “We had committees that checked when and where residents were building, but people started doing as they pleased,” she said. Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said the City was not aware of the incident. “Evictions can only be executed through a court. The owner has the right to protect his property,” said Gadebe. “The City’s Metro cops weren’t involved in the eviction, but were there to oversee the proceedings. Police officers were also present.”
