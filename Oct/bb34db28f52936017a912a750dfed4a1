CRIME in Moloto Village has increased and the need for a police station has become urgent. People in the village near Kwamhlanga made the appeal to Mpumalanga Community Safety MEC Pat Ngomane at a crime imbizo on Sunday. They said taverns and nyaope have led to an increase in crime in the area. They complained that people are robbed when boarding buses in the morning. The MEC agreed on a plan to build a police station and said police visibility would be improved. Ngomane urged people to play a role in fighting crime. “Residents must come up with solutions to work with cops. “Police in cahoots with thugs must be reported, or we will lose this war. “A satellite police station won’t solve the problem but a full police station will help. “The police love for residents has decreased, affecting their protection of citizens. The CPF will be strengthened and given tools but no stipend. “CPF members should be taught to lead evidence in courts during proceedings to ensure hefty sentences for thugs.” Co-operative governance MEC Speedy Mashilo said the municipality should have support to help the police. “Everyone should be a cop to ensure we enter the festive season safely. “The municipality should control taverns. Too many are near roads, churches and schools. Officials take bribes to allow taverns anywhere, while kids attack teachers and people are robbed.” Moloto CPF chairman Leseba Monagane said they want to work with Gauteng members.
