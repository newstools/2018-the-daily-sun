FOR years, residents of Show Village have been pleading for their stormwater drains to be fixed. The people of the kasi in Motherwell, Nelson Mandela Bay, said every time it rains, their houses are flooded. But it finally looks as if they will be getting some relief. MMC Rosie Daaminds and officials from the infrastructure and engineering department recently visited wards in Motherwell. “It has come to our attention that Motherwell is in danger when it comes to stormwater drains. “It is unhealthy for our people to live in such an environment, which is why we have come here to get first-hand experience of the situation,” said Daaminds. “Residents have many complaints when it comes to the drains, especially now that we are entering the rainy season. “I’m here with officials and engineers to plan for solutions and to resolve the problems our people face on a daily basis. “It is unacceptable to have water running into people’s homes.” Resident William Mpiyakhe said he had been pleading with the municipality for years to install storm water drains near his house. “We are in a low area and every time it rains, my house gets flooded. We become soaking wet,” he said. William’s neighbour, Phindiswa Mphithi, said: “It has been 10 years of living like a fish in our house. “We don’t have a solution for this problem.”
