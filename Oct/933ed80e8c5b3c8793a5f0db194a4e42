Celebrity chef, Siba Mtongana is finally sharing pictures of her two-month-old baby girl. The proud momma gave birth to NtandoyeNkosi Mtongana on the 26th of July this year, meaning that she is almost three-months-old. This is Siba and hubby, Brian’s fourth child together after their two daughters and a son. Siba seems to be loving every moment of motherhood and is juggling her demanding career and being a busy mom pretty well. She is currently taking some time out from work to spend some quality time with her family and her new-born baby. While she’s on holiday, Siba is having cute afternoon dates with Ntando and showing her off on social media. “Really enjoying this time off from work for a while with my lil princess and the rest of the squad these school holidays... The rest is doing me well and enjoying breastfeeding this precious soul building a special priceless bond with Princess Ntando,” she said recently. In another photo, she posed with hubby Brian and all four kids. “This is our kind of perfect,” she captioned it. Check out the snaps of baby Ntando and the rest of the family: What a beautiful day... 3 days ago our lil princess arrived early in the morning... Her name is NtandoyeNkosi Mtongana aka Ntando bouncing healthy at 3,4kgs ... She's the scale balancer at home... two boys, two girls ????... We're so excited to finally welcome her...
