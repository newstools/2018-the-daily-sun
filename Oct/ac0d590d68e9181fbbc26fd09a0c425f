WHEN thugs stole a white Peugeot in Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, they thought they had hit the jackpot. But they didn’t get far. It flew over a bridge on Friday night. As the car got to the bridge at Cottondale, outside Acornhoek, they driver apparently lost control and the car flew over the bridge and landed on a railway line. Luckily, no one was killed but the car was found with its engine and some parts missing. Car owner Deon Mathebula (44) told the SunTeam he was fast asleep when he received a call from cops. He said they told him his car had overturned and landed on the railway line under a bridge. “Upon arrival, there was no engine and some of its parts were stripped,” said Mathebula. Sipho Bereta, a supervisor at Afri-guard security, said they were patrolling the area when they spotted the white car and called the police. “The car landed in the middle of the railway line. “The freight trains had to use the other lane as the car had obstructed the lane. “Things returned to normal after the car was towed off the tracks,” said Bereta. Police spokeswoman Captain Mpho Nonyane confirmed a case of reckless and negligent driving had been opened against the suspects but no arrests have been made.
