SEARCH parties have been combing through Maraxwe, Makwarani, Makonde and surrounding villages. This is after the disappearance of 31-year-old Thilivhali Ralikhwatha from Ngovhela Backside outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo. According to his sister, Balanganani Gavhi, Ralikhwatha went to the local church on Sunday 23 September with other family members. But before the formal service started, he left and went home. She claimed he found their granny at home. He apparently fetched a bag with clothing and left without telling anyone where he was going. Ralikhwatha was last seen at Ngovhela Village, wearing grey trousers and a brown jacket. He’s short in height, slender and is brown in complexion. “We have searched everywhere but without any success. We have sleepless nights thinking of what could have happened to him. “As for me, I cannot even eat. He is my only sibling. “My mother can’t come to terms with his disappearance either,” said Gavhi.
