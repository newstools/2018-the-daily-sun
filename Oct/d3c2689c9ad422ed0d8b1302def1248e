A FAMILY from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni is struggling to come to terms with the horrific scene they witnessed yesterday. A mum found her daughter lying in a pool of blood with her throat slit, as well as her grandson’s lifeless body. And the suspect is a relative! The relative allegedly called the family in the morning to confess. Shocked by the confession, the mum rushed to her daughter’s rented room and made the gruesome discovery. “He was always respectful. He was the last person you’d suspect of committing such a horrible act,” said the family’s spokeswoman. “I honestly don’t understand what happened, but I want the truth to be revealed. “We want to find out what happened to the child’s eye and index finger. “Why did we find the child in clean clothes and nappy even though he had a gaping wound in his abdomen?” A tenant who rented a room in the same yard as the suspect said: “He was one of the most laid back people I’d ever met. “He never raised his voice or fought with anyone.” Police spokesman Captain Mofana Masela said cops received reports of a double murder in Umthambeka section. “Upon arrival, the officers found a suspect (25) who had allegedly killed a woman (28) and a child (1). “The owner of the house where they were renting wasn’t there when the incident happened. “The suspect, who is an alleged drug addict, was arrested and detained at Tembisa South Police Station.”
