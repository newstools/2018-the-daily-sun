THE future looks bleak for Gupta-owned Shiva Uranium Mine employees at Hartebeesfontein near Klerksdorp, North West. The mine was bought by the Guptas in 2010, with a promise to improve the lives of the people, but so far it’s been all heartache and stress. The employees’ problems started last year when they marched over workers being fired without the proper procedures being followed. Those who took part in the legal march were either fired, suspended or given retrenchment packages. A cloud hangs over the remaining workers, who haven’t been paid since March. In July, workers were told the mine was earmarked to be sold to new shareholders. But community leader Binga Modise said potential investors pulled out because of the mine’s unsatisfactory safety report. The operation has come to a halt, making the workers’ lives difficult. The mine has allegedly not paid its creditors, including the Industrial Development Corporation, for loans that run into millions. Hundreds of workers from nearby Tigane kasi are affected by the issues at Shiva Uranium. Modise said: “All we need is for the mine to operate normally or to be sold to a willing buyer who can continue operations. “People need jobs, development and the money owed to them. “For now, it seems the workers are on their own and cannot get help from anyone. Things are kept secret from the workers.” Mine employees said their kids had to drop out of school, while others had to depend on their families. Manager John Kruger, who has been in meetings with workers, has not responded to the SunTeam’s enquiries for months.
