BACKYARDERS have been occupying Luyolo Community Centre in Gugulethu, Cape Town, since 21 May. Their shacks in NY112 were destroyed by municipal cops. They said the city has not kept its promise to build them temporary houses. Gugulethu G-7 Backyarders chairwoman Phindile Nazo (28) said they live in degrading conditions. “The land we occupied has been vacant for more than 30 years,” she said. “We didn’t have anywhere to build our shacks, so we occupied the hall. “When the cops kicked us off the land they destroyed our TVs and furniture. “They promised to provide a temporary place but nothing has happened since May.” The backyarders don’t have privacy. The hall has a creche, and church services take place on Sundays. Councillor Bongani Ngcombolo had to vacate his office when backyarders moved in. Sindiswa Mninci (32) said: “When they demolished our shacks, it was cold and raining and we ended up here.” Apparently, the councillor allowed them to move in. Siphosethu Nzewane (52) said: “I’ve been here for five months. I used to live in Barcelona, but the owner wanted the shack back and I joined backyarders who were occupying land. Mine was destroyed.” City law enforcement’s Wayne Dyason said: “Officers couldn’t take action against the people in the hall. “They have an agreement with the councillor to occupy it temporarily.”
