INNOCENT people are robbed and shot dead every day. And cops believe that’s because there are too many illegal guns in Mzansi Captain Solomon Sibiya has appealed to the public to help get these guns out of the hands of criminals. He said such guns were almost always used to commit violent crime. “We appeal to the public to help in the fight against violent and grievous crimes committed using firearms,” said Sibiya. “There is a significant increase in armed robberies in the area, where victims are threatened with firearms and in extreme cases, are killed.” He said they received reports almost every day of robberies in open spaces and on the streets. Women were robbed of handbags and cellphones, and thugs posing as cops hijacked motorists on main routes. He said delivery trucks were often robbed and bread delivery trucks were easy targets. “Kagiso police are very concerned about the number of firearms that are in the wrong hands,” he said. “Every week we register pointing with firearms and associated robbery cases. “If community members, including community policing forums, worked together we would make a difference.” He appealed to anyone with information on an unlicensed firearm to come forward or to call Kagiso cop shop on 011 696 9000 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
