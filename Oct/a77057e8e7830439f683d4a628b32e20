Anyone familiar with the Twitter streets knows that Ntsiki Mazwai does not need a second invitation to engage in a Twitter war. The controversial poet got into yet another Twar on Tuesday, this time with local social media influencer Mihlali Ndamase. The war of words started when Mihlali shared on Twitter how her parents did not allow her to take public transport when she was younger as they feared for her safety. The Tweet did not sit well with Ntsiki who accused Mihlali of sounding like “white privilege.” “Kids don't use public transport because their parents don't think they are important,” she replied, “careful Mihlali. You're speaking with your mouth full and showing us chewed food.” That response set of a war of words between the two with Mihlali standing her ground on the matter. As is always the case, people on Twitter were left to pick sides with some believing Ntsiki had a point while others felt she was overreacting. Their spat escalated quickly, soon enough the two were hurling insults at one another. Check out the tweets below:
