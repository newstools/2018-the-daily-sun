THE new Mr and Miss Mphahlama have been crowned! Following serious financial setbacks, pageant founders Jean Mohlala (31) and Tlhookomelo Mashile (25) still presented an event that was a roaring success. It took place at Matibidi Cultural Centre. The pageant was co-founded in 2014 and had its first groundbreaking event in October 2015. “We created a tradition of hosting this very exclusive event annually in October to add value to the lives of the communities and the youth living here,” said Tlhookomelo. The fourth annual Mr & Miss Mphahlama was a huge success. “We had a major setback with our usual contributing sponsors, who we cannot disclose, and had to dip into our own personal savings to avoid any cancellation,” said Tlhookomelo. They had a total of 25 contestants, a VIP and a general section and a panel of five judges. The hopefuls were competing in three categories – Miss Mphahlama Junior, Miss Mphahlama, and Mr Mphahlama. The pageant was judged by Philemon Sebashi, Chantel Maluleka, Rodney Mashile and Khurhula Hlabela. “It gives us peace to see how the little funding we bring into this project changed lives, and how it revived the confidence of our contestants” said Jean. “We would like to extend an invitation to corporate organisations, companies, businesses, and communities all over South Africa to come on board as sponsors, or any form of assistance which could help,” said Tlhookomelo.
