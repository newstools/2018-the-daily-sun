SCORES of boys from the OR Tambo and Alfred Nzo districts were taught initiation safety procedures by circumcision authorities on Tuesday. Young underage boys often feel the pressure to go to the mountains just to fit in. Daily Sun spoke to boys aged between 16 and 18 who are due to go to the summer initiation school. Aphile Mpeka, a grade 10 pupil at Maluti High School, said they were bullied by those who had gone through initiation. “They bully us and separate themselves from us,” he said. “This puts pressure on younger boys to go to initiation school.” Aphile said going to initiation school, his custom, was important to him. Each initiation season claims lives, but Reatile Khauta (18) said that didn’t scare him. Chief Loyiso Nqevu told the boys it was no use initiated if they didn’t act like men. “Men today are not men we should be proud of,” said the chief “You must be pillars of the nation. Initiation is just like going to university. “When getting circumcised, you make a promise that you will forever answer for your actions and uphold the custom. That’s what being a man means.” Education special programmes acting director Andile Mtirara said they started the Safe Passage to Manhood programme to curb deaths, especially in the OR Tambo region.
