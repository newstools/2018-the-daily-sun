THE presence of Owen da Gama and Allan Freese, who have laid their hands on the Telkom Knockout title, will go a long way in boosting Highlands Park’s morale for the 2018 TKO. The Lions of the North will travel to Pietermaritzburg on Friday for their Telkom Knockout Last 16 clash with Fadlu Davids’ Maritzburg United. The match is scheduled to take place at Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday (8:15pm). This will be Highlands’ second appearance in this competition, having first featured in the TKO in 2016 when they were knocked out in the quarterfinals by Orlando Pirates. This time the Tembisa outfit will go into the competition with added motivation, as they have the brains of Da Gama and Freese, who have won the title with now defunct Platinum Stars previously. Da Gama won the TKO, which comes with a winner’s purse of R4 million, in 2006 when Platinum Stars were still known as Silver Stars, while the 62-year-old Freese made it into the history books when he won it in 2013. However, veteran Highlands midfielder Lindokuhle Mbatha, who was part of the team when Freese won the trophy, has warned his team not to rely too much on history, but rather write their own. “Our coaches have done it before and I’m lucky to be one of the players who have won this trophy. But now the game has evolved and we cannot read too much into that. We can use that as extra motivation,” said Mbatha. “Going to Maritzburg will not be an easy trip but we are capable of writing our own history in this competition.” Maritzburg, who were at their level best last season, have not been doing well this season. They were knocked out in the first round of the MTN8 and are struggling in the league, where they are currently fourth from bottom in the table with seven points from seven games. Mbatha says it counts for nothing, as this is a cup clash and will be a different ball game. He said: “We will need to be on top of our game, we cannot take them lightly just because they have been struggling.”
