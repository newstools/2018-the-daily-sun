THE SEX is hot and the climax is near. Now comes the question: is it time to pull out before you
ejaculate and avoid risking pregnancy? Daily Sun spoke to some men about their views on pulling
their 4-5 out before climax, a well known method of birth control. One said: “I think pulling out is a waste of time. The
point is to enjoy the sexual experience, if I pull out then there is no point
of having sex.” Another agreed: “I do not pull out. Imagine if you are in
the heat of the moment and you are on cloud 9 and your partner is gripping you,
then you have to pull out! It’s hard to pull out when you’re having so much
fun.” But others are super cautious about avoiding pregnancy. “There is nothing wrong with pulling out but nothing is
100%. I still pull out even if I have a condom on,” said another. But will sacrificing that moment of pleasure of coming
into your lover guarantee she won’t get pregnant anyway? According to experts, pulling out is not 100% safe. This
is because a man ejects pre-ejaculate fluid during sex. The pre-ejaculate fluid
is just a few drops, but even this little still contains at least 300 000 sperm. Still, pulling your 4-5 out before ejaculating does go a long
way to reducing your chances of getting pregnant, if this is what you are
trying to avoid.
