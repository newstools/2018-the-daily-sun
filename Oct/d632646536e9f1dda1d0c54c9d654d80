SUPER Zuma’s political career has been given a lifeline. The former ANC KZN secretary, who lost to Mdumiseni Ntuli at the July provincial conference, has been made deputy chief whip in the Legislature. Zuma had been unemployed since early this year after the NEC dissolved the provincial executive committee. The Pietermaritzburg High Court had set aside the 2015 conference, where he was elected secretary. The job was left vacant by Ntuli, who resigned as deputy chief whip when he was elected secretary in July. Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, Zuma said he was sworn in on Thursday. He welcomed the appointment and thanked the party for entrusting him with the position. “As cadres of our movement, we go and serve the people where the party wants us to go. I’m settling in now. I attended my first sitting on Friday,” he said. ANC spokeswoman Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu wished Zuma well in his new position.
