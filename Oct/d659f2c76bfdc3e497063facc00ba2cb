WESTBURY residents breathed a sigh of relief yesterday after two cops from Sophiatown Police Station were arrested. The warrant officer (45) and sergeant (42) were charged with murder and defeating the ends of justice. They are expected to appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court today For years residents suspected the station’s cops of working with criminals and drug lords. CPF chairwoman Tilly Michaels (44) said: “The community of Westbury has been complaining about the two officers ever since I started as a CPF member three years ago.” She said there was little they could do about the situation because they didn’t have evidence. “We’re very happy. There’ve been changes in the area since Police Minister Bheki Cele’s visit,” she said. Cele welcomed the arrests. He said a task team sent to the area had found evidence and made arrests. “We can neither afford nor tolerate any unethical behaviour or corrupt members within our ranks,” he said.
