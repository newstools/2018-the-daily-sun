TOP cops and CPF representatives from the country’s five police stations with the highest murder rates appeared in parliament yesterday. While briefing the portfolio committee on police, Police Minister Bheki Cele said the only way to deal with crime was to reduce poverty. Representatives came from cop shops in Nyanga and Mitchells Plain in Cape Town, Hillbrow and Joburg Central in Joburg and Kagiso in Mogale City. Cele said many people were living like animals and if that wasn’t resolved, crime wouldn’t go down. He said if people from poor areas were placed in rich areas, their behaviour would change. NFP MP Shaik Emam said: “If we don’t address the problems of people in areas like Brown’s Farm, it’s a ticking time bomb. We need to come together and see how we are going to deal with it.” Nyanga CPF secretary Dumisani Qwabe said the kasi remained the murder capital because government departments didn’t work together. “Police officers from Cape Town hardly come to Nyanga. When a car stops at a red robot, taxis here hoot to force the car to cross because traffic officers don’t come here.”
