AFTER working with orphans for many years, Sello Mangwana (33) decided to write a book about his experiencs. Sello, the author of Orphans and Superheroes, said he used his own money to publish the book. “I realised orphans were being rejected and no one wanted to motivate them, so I wrote this book,” he said. On Saturday, Sello read the book to orphans at Emasithandane Children’s Organisation in Cape Town. Zuko Khundayi, one of the motivational speakers at the event, said orphans needed love. “Sometimes society pities orphans for no reason. “We think we are helping by feeling sorry for them, but we aren’t because they end up feeling like charity cases,” said Zuko. Sello said he also wanted to inspire budding writers. “Aspiring writers face a lot of challenges. Getting funding and distribution deals isn’t easy. “I hope my book helps people realise that dreams don’t work until they do. There would be no King David without Goliath. “Face your challenges because one day you will be victorious. Where you come from does not determine your future. Your future is in your hands.”
