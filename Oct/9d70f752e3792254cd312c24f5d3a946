HAWKERS in Lusikisiki are sick and tired of empty promises made by the Ingquza Hill Municipality. They told Daily Sun they had been waiting for years for trading stalls they were promised. Hawkers representative Nothobile Biata (55) said in 2012, the municipality provided them with cement stalls. But she said they were scared they would make them sick as they were cold and dirty. She said in 2013, they were given 30 containers to trade from but there were not nearly enough stalls for all the hawkers. “There are close to 2 000 of us but they only gave us 30 stalls, which can’t even accommodate half of us,” she said. “We agreed to take those containers because they promised to come back soon, which has not happened to this day.” Nozibele Gwagisa (59), who has been selling fruit and vegetables for the last 15 years, said the municipality doesn’t care about them. The hawkers said the shelter that protected them from getting wet on rainy days was built by Boxer Supermarket and not the municipality. “If it wasn’t for the supermarket, we would have had even more problems on rainy or hot days because our municipality is taking us for fools,” said Nozibele. Municipal spokesman Zamuxolo Mathwasa admitted there were problems but said they were working to resolve the matter. “I can tell you we are working on something and they will get the stalls they have been waiting for,” said Mathwasa. He said the municipality had already identified the location where they would put the stalls. “We have a problem with the number of hawkers increasing every day, many of whom don’t want to register their names at the municipality.”
