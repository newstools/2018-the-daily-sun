BILLIONAIRE Patrice Motsepe is known for giving back to the community. So when Ashley Mthembu was struggling to find a job, he turned to the businessman. But the person he approached had faked Motsepe’s identity on social media and Ashley ended up losing R4 500. The 36-year-old from Palm Springs, Vaal, told Daily Sun he deposited money into the fraudster’s account two weeks ago. “After I sent the money, he asked for another R11 000,” he said. “I became suspicious and called the Motsepe Foundation, only to find out I had been scammed.” Ashley said after he lost his job in March last year, he contacted the fake Motsepe on Facebook. “I got a response and he gave his personal assistant’s,” he said. “He advised me to draw up a business plan for him to fund a pub I wanted to open.” Ashley said the Facebook con man sounded like the real deal. Ashley said he prepared the business plan and was promised millions of rands in funding earlier this month. In one of the emails from the fake Motsepe, the fraudster promises to make a payment 72 hours after Ashley sent him R4 500. The foundation’s spokesman, Sizwe Nzimande, said the billionaire was not on social media. He said Patrice would never ask for money in return for business opportunities. “We’re aware of cases where fraudulent social media profiles have been created using his name “Where we’re able to identify the people involved, we don’t hesitate to take legal action against them.” Vereeniging police spokesman Captain Fikile Funda said cops were investigating a case of fraud.
