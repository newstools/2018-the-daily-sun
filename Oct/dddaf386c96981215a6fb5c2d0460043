THE life of single mum Fikile Khumalo (37) and her five kids will not be the same again. The family was given a new house donated by the Sondelani branch of the ANC in Thulamahashe on Sunday. The six-roomed house has a sitting room, kitchen, three bedrooms and a bathroom. The family also received furniture from Ngwabela Transport and SNI Suppliers. Fikile said she was happy because they used to live in a crumbling two-roomed RDP house that was built in 2002. The house belonged to her late mum. “I’m grateful for the new house. I didn’t believe it when ANC leaders in the area promised to build a house for us,” she said. Rodgers Tshobete, chairman of the ANC branch, said they were happy that the family finally had a proper house. Wonderboy Masinga, secretary of the branch, said they had known about the poor family since the party’s door-to-door campaign in 2016. “We were touched by their living conditions. We contacted the human settlements department, but it couldn’t help because the family already had an RDP. We then raised money to build a proper house for the family,” he said.
