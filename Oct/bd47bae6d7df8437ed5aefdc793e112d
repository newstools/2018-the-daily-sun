SUNDAY was a joyful day as a husband and wife from Soweto shared stories about how they managed to stay away from booze for many years. The husband hasn’t had a drink since he joined Alcoholics Anonymous 33 years ago, while the wife has been sober for 11 years. The other two people who were celebrating with them had been sober for three and six years. She said: “We went to Home Affairs three times to file for divorce. “We had to abandon the idea the first two times because the train we wanted to use wasn’t operating properly. “On the third attempt, we ended up watching a film called Dogs of War. “We laughed when we realised we were holding hands in the cinema. “God probably didn’t want us to separate.” The husband said although he used to pressurise his wife into drinking, he couldn’t stand it when she was drunk. The celebration was a warm-up for the annual Soweto Alcoholics Anonymous imbizo at Uncle Tom’s Hall in Orlando West next Saturday. Entry is free. The imbizo is the organisation’s way of letting alcoholics know help is available and it’s never too late to quit. For more information, call Alcoholics Anonymous on 011 027 7132 or 0861 453 722.
