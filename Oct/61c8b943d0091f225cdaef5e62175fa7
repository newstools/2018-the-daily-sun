A CROOK bust stealing a motorcycle claims that he did so
to keep his girlfriend happy. According to Punch, Sharif Audu (18) was apprehended by
cops in Minna, Niger State in western Nigeria after allegedly stealing a
motorbike belonging to Yakubu Ndanusa. Audu was apparently seen lurking suspiciously around
Honey Bell Hotel in the city. Lovestruck Audu told Punch: “The desire to satisfy the
needs of my girlfriend made me steal the motorcycle. I don’t want to say no to
her and that is why I do anything to make her happy, no matter what. “I don’t want to share her with anybody and that is why I
will go the extra mile to fulfil her needs. I don’t care what it may result in,
my duty is to provide what she needs before any other thing, I love her so
much.” Cop Muhammad Abubakar confirmed the stolen motorbike was
recovered from the suspect. The matter will be taken to court after an investigation.
