OPPOSITION parties in the Ndwedwe Municipality, north of Durban want technical services director Dumisani Mzolo out. Mzolo was among 10 suspects arrested by the Hawks last month and charged with theft of R1,3 million while doing the same job at Harry Gwala Municipality in Ixopo, southern KZN. They appeared in the Durban Specialised Commercial Crimes Court and were released on R5 000 bail. The court heard that last year the suspects asked companies for R1,3 million for work that was never done and shared the money among themselves and with the owners of the companies. Mzolo resigned last year and got a job at Ndwedwe Municipality. IFP whip in Ndwedwe Municipality, Mzwelanga Sishi said the party would ask the special council sitting today how the panel that interviewed Mzolo didn’t pick up that he was under investigation. EFF Councillor Sabelo Hlophe said the party would call for Mzolo’s suspension pending his corruption case. Harry Gwala municipal spokesman Ndabezinhle Tenza said Mzolo and other officials resigned after the municipality started an internal investigation. Ndwedwe municipal spokeswoman Thobile Nxumalo said the municipality couldn’t comment as the matter was in court. Mzolo was sent questions on Wednesday and called yesterday, but he didn’t take the calls.
