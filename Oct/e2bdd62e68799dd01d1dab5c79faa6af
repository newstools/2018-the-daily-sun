SIPHO Nomandla (33) loved expensive clothes, but it cost him his life! On Sunday, while he was sleeping, his friends allegedly broke into his shack and attacked him. Theydragged him out of the shack and dumped his body in an open space near Khutsong, extension 5 in Carletonville, west of Joburg. They went back to his shack, took his clothes and disappeared. Agnes Nomandla (76) said she won’t forgive the people who killed her son. “They took my son’s life because they wanted his expensive clothes,” she said. “It’s hard for me to accept what has happened.” She said she was woken up by cops’ knocking on her door on Monday morning. “I collapsed when I realised what they were saying,” she said. Agnes went to the open space and watched as her son’s body was loaded into a mortuary van. “I opened the body bag and could see that he tried to fight off his attackers,” she said. “Those people will confess to their crime one day.” Agnes said her son was a hard worker who ran a small business. “He was not the type of a person who waited for hand-outs.” Captain Eddie Boboko of Khutsong Police Station said a murder case was opened.
