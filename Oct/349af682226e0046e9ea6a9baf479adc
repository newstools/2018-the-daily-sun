FREE State Stars coach Luc Eymael eased the pressure that has been mounting after he guided his side to a 2-0 victory over Bloemfontein Celtic on Saturday afternoon. After an impressive 2017-18 campaign where he led Ea Lla Koto to claim Nedbank Cup and finished within the top six in the Absa Premiership, a lot was expected from him and his side this season. But the Bethlehem based outfit has been struggling to regain last seasonâ€™s performance as they came to yesterdays encounter having already lost five of their nine opening fixtures, drew twice and won the other two. That created an immense pressure on the coach as they were also eliminated in the first round of the MTN8 cup competition. Goals from Congolese international Harris Tchilimbou in the first half and Sinethemba Jantjie in the other half of the match ensured that Stars claim the bragging right of the Free State Derby which took place at Goble Park Stadium. The results will be a huge sigh of relief for Eymael who seem to be struggling to get the best line up as he has been making major changes for each and every game that they have played. After 10 league games Stars have now collected 11 points. Their next game they will visit Black Leopards at Peter Mokaba Stadium after the Fifa International break on 28 October, Peter Mokaba Stadium. Celtic who suffered their second defeat of the season remain on 14 points after eight games. And their next game they will hosrt Baroka at Dr Molemela Stadium on 28 October.
