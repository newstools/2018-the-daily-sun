HOME Affairs Minister  Malusi Gigaba on Friday reopened the Port Elizabeth Refugee Reception Centre. It was closed in 201 1 following  a court order. Corrupt officials had reportedly been workingwith human trafficking syndicates. Rights organisations then asked the court to forcethe government to reopen the centre. It will offer services to ne w asylum applicants. The new office, in the Telk om building in Sydenham, offers state-of-the-art technology and boasts CCTV cameras in and around the building. I  nterpretation services are offered through telephone from the head office in Tshwane. This move was welcomed  by immigrants, who had to travel out of the province to sort out their papers. Gigaba said: “This centre is resourced with the perfect balance of human capital and up-to-date technology that will allow us to streamline our services and efforts  in assisting asylum seekers and refugees, and deal with future obstacles.” He said this was necessary   to identity children in refugee situations. The office would reduce the burden on other out-of-town centres. Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Mongameli Boban i said: “I’ m   so  impressed with the technology used. There is no human contact involved and there is no exchange of paperwork.” National Somali Association chairman Shukri Diis said: “The centre will reduce travelling costs of refugees and asylum seekers. “They no longer have to travel to Durban, Cape Town  or Gauteng to extend their days of staying in the country.”
