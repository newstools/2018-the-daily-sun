SKOLOPAD says the crash that nearly killed her last month happened while she was driving to the police station to be arrested! The 35-year-old was driving on Mampoi Road in Phuthaditjhaba, Free State, when she collided with an oncoming car. Skolopad said when she beat her troubled daughter in front of two cops, they told her to drive with them to Mokodumela cop shop. The two then got into Skolopad’s black Renault with her and her daughter. Skolopad, whose real name is Nonhlanhla Qwabe, said: “The woman was sitting with my daughter in the back while the man was in the passenger seat. “I hit a speed bump and the cop in the back turned the steering wheel. I then collided into an oncoming car,” she claimed. “How could she do that while the car was moving? My daughter sustained injuries to her left knee. That cop nearly killed us.” Skolopad said she was traumatised, as she heard the other driver had died. After being discharged on Friday, she now has to use crutches and a wheelchair until she heals. Sergeant Mmako Mophiring said a case of culpable homicide was being investigated. “A constable and an officer were rushed to hospital. The constable was taken to ICU. A 61-year-old man in the other car died.”
