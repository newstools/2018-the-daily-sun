The Timothy Omotoso rape trial continues in the Port Elizabeth High Court as Judge Mandela Makaula will rule if he will recuse himself from the case or not. This after defence lawyer Peter Daubermann, asked Judge Makaula to recuse himself from the case. On Monday last week, Makaula dismissed an application by Daubermann, to recuse himself from the case. Dauberman said his clients felt that the judge had clearly sided with state witness Cheryl Zondi when he excused her from the stand to write her university exams. Omotoso, Zukiswa Sitho (28) and Lusanda Solani (36) are facing charges of racketeering, violating the sexual offences act, human trafficking and rape.
