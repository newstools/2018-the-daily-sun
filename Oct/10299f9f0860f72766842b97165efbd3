DRUG lords, corrupt cops and gangsters better watch out. The feared amaberete are on their case and will be hunting them in coming weeks. This was what Police Minister Bheki Cele told residents of Westbury in Joburg when he came out guns blazing during his visit yesterday. After three days of protests against drugs, gangsterism and allegedly corrupt cops at Sophiatown cop shop, Cele promised residents that specialised police units would be sent to the area. Speaking to hundreds of furious community members, Cele said: “National commissioner General Khehla Sitole will today institute an investigation into the behaviour at the police station and give us results after a week.” The minister promised to investigate corrupt cops and called on the community to work with him by giving information. Speaking about amaberete, Cele said: “They will be here to join the team of 20 that’s already here to help patrol your streets and take on gangsters.” Cele said the commissioner would put together an anticorruption unit to investigate drug lords. He said two people suspected of having been involved in the shoot-out that killed a resident last week had been arrested. “There are two that are still outstanding. We’re requesting between 24 and 72 hours to apprehend them,” said the minister. Cele told residents he and other leaders would return to the area in two weeks’ time to address the community’s concerns. While Cele was speaking, many residents started chanting, “Free our people!”, referring to the eight people arrested for public violence on Monday. Cele told them he couldn’t commit to releasing the arrested protesters as it was a police matter. Speaking to the SunTeam about issues facing the community, a crying Stacey-Lee Solomon said: “Our siblings don’t want to go to school.” Stacey-Lee said they were getting shot at. On Monday night, protesters torched a Rea Vaya bus station.
