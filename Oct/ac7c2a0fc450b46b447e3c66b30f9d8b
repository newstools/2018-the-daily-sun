A HUGE cloud of smoke hovered over the shops as the fire raged. Early morning shoppers watched helplessly as the flames ate everything inside. Nearby shop owners removed their valuables as they feared the fire might spread. But what no one realised was that four Bangladeshi men were trapped inside and were burned alive. When Madibeng firefighters arrived at the scene on Saturday, nothing could be done to save the four people or their shop in Brits, North West. Security guards said they suspect the fire had been set deliberately. They said the fire could have been started by thugs trying to steal money from the four men in the shop. “We noticed the fire in the early hours. The town is not busy at that time. It’s possible the thugs did their job without being seen,” said a security guard. A shop owner in the same street said shopkeepers were too afraid to sleep in their shops, saying they feared those who had set the shop alight might return. “We are terrified. Rumours are spreading and we don’t know what to believe. This fear will only be over once we see the culprits behind bars,” he said. North West police spokeswoman Captain Aafje Botma said they had opened an inquest docket. She confirmed four Bangladeshi men aged 23, 28, 34 and 50 died in the fire. “We are investigating the cause of the fire,” she said.
