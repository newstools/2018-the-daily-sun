CHIPPA United boss Siviwe Mpengesi is prepared to give Meshack Maphangule and Abel Mabaso the chance to get regular game-time. SunSport has reliably learnt that both players will be loaned out to the Chilli Boys in the January transfer window. Both players have struggled to break into coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic’s Orlando Pirates side since their arrival before the start of the season. Mabaso was among the Chilli Boys’ top performing players in the middle of the park under the guidance of then coach Teboho Moloi last season. But he has had tough competition for a spot in the Pirates team, as the likes of Musa Nyatama, Ben Motshwari and Xola Mlambo have done a great job to help Bucs be among the early pacesetters in the Absa Premiership. Maphangule, meanwhile, played a crucial role to help Black Leopards gain promotion to the top flight via the National First Division relegation/promotion play-offs. The versatile player, who enjoys playing on the flanks, has faced stiff competition from the likes of Luvuyo Memela and Thembinkosi Lorch, while Thabo Qalinge is also fighting for the same position. Maphangule, who scored three goals for Lidoda Duvha last season, has yet to find the back of net and has only played one game so far this season. Said Mpengesi: “I have noticed that they are not playing. They are both good, talented players. We will talk to them to see if they are available in January.” Meanwhile, SunSport has reliably learnt that Bucs right-back Asavela Mbekile will also get a loan move to any interested club as he has been idle on the sidelines without action. The versatile 31-year-old player secured a move to Pirates in June, having endured a difficult time at Mamelodi Sundowns last season. His aim was to help Bucs win the Caf Champions League after joining the Soweto giants as a free agent. But that goal seems a distant memory as he has yet to make his debut for the Soweto giants.
