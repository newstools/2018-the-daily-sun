KAIZER Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas blames his strikers for their shocking 1-0 defeat to Polokwane City in an Absa Premiership match played at the empty Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. Chiefs and City had to play without supporters after Chiefs were punished for their fans’ misbehaviour following their Nedbank semifinal defeat to Free State Stars. As if that was not enough, Rise and Shine well and truly parked the bus in the second half of the clash to make things even more difficult for Amakhosi. Vusimuzi Mngomezulu scored the winning goal for City. “I am disappointed with the first half but in the second half my boys played well,” said Solinas after the game. “In the first half there was no mobility, no movement. We don’t understand the way they attacked Polokwane’s back four with no clear idea, but in the second half the guys performed. “Polokwane scored and stayed at the back the whole game. They did not create chances apart from the goal. But this is football, this situation does happen. “Our performance was more positive in the second half, but it’s not easy to play like this – the entire Polokwane City team stayed behind the ball. Space was very tight.” Chiefs have now gone two league matches without a win. They played to a disappointing goalless draw with PSL newcomers Highlands Park in their previous game. They are third in the league table with 14 points from 10 games, two points behind leaders Bidvest Wits, who are tied with rivals Orlando Pirates on 16 points. Solinas has turned his focus to the eagerly awaited Soweto derby against Pirates at FNB Stadium on 27 October. Added the coach: “Congratulations to Polokwane on the win.  We’ll move forward and continue working hard.”
