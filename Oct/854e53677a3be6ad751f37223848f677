THE African National
Congress (ANC) says it’s deeply shocked by the brutal murder of Councilor
Luyanda Mbele. Mbele and his cousin
Mzwandile Mathenjwa were killed last night. “The ANC offers its
deepest condolences to the family, friends and comrades of both cousins. It has been
established that they were shot and killed after dropping off their cousin in
Wallacedene last night,” ANC Provincial Secretary Faiez Jacobs said. “No-one should be
allowed to commit crime and think they can get away with it,” added Jacobs. “This is a great loss
to the movement in the city and the province as a whole. Comrade Luyanda was a
product of the ANC Youth League in the area and had contributed over many years
to youth development. He was very active in
local football and at one stage had served as the chairperson of the Bloekombos
Football Association,” Jacobs said. Jacobs  said only last week, comrade Luyanda was part
of a meeting briefing national transport minister Blade Nzimande about public
transport challenges in the city and province. Luyanda was reportedly very involved in trying
to build, unite and strengthen the co-operative movement in our province. “We will not rest
until these cowardly murderers are arrested, prosecuted and sent to jail,"
Jacobs said.
