LEIPZIG won the singing contest in the  stands. But they couldn’t get a result where it mattered most, on the pitch, as they were held to a goalless draw by Schalke in their Bundesliga clash here on Sunday.Thousands of fans crammed into the 2006 World Cup venue. The stadium was refurbished to host the 2006 World Cup matches, but not quite built for the perennially cold Germany weather conditions. The 42 000-seater offers little protection from the biting chill usually brought by torrential rain. But the chill weather condition hardly keeps the fans Leipzig away. As they normally do in these part of the world, supporters brave even the worst conditions to watch their beloved team. Nothing tempers with their weekend schedule. From the grannies to the kids, everyone attends, regardless of who the opponent is. Again they were dancing in the rain, singing on top of their voices way before the game got underway. The efficient transport system in this eastern Germany city allows for fans to arrive well in time for the kick off. They call it the “German way”, a culture cultivated over many years, even before many outside Germany knew there were other teams except Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. Borussia Dortmund, Schalke and Leipzig have slowly been closing the gap on Bayern, though the lack of consistency in performances, as seen yesterday, often undermines their efforts. Leipzig looked like they short on Red Bull energy, squandering the few chances they had in the opening half. Schalke were great shakes either, though they had the upperhand, playing away from home. Breel Embolo failed to fire for visiting Schalke while Werner Timo couldn’t inspire Die Bullen to victory at home.
