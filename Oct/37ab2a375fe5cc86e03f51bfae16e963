The 18-month battle between the DA and its mayor of Cape Town, Patricia de Lille, was expected to come to an end on Wednesdayâ€¦ but probably won't. The DA is insistent that De Lille honour their agreement and resign as mayor on Wednesday, while De Lille disputes that they ever had an agreement and is on a mission to clear her name of what she calls a smear campaign against her. In August, De Lille and DA leader Mmusi Maimane appeared side by side at a media conference to announce that De Lille will resign as mayor come October 31, and the DA will drop its internal charges against De Lille. De Lille, however, disputes that she had a deal with the DA. Mazzone said on Tuesday: "The DA has noted with surprise Ms De Lille's comments that she had no agreement with the DA to resign. This is simply untrue. Not only did she make the announcement that she would resign at a briefing with the DA leader, Mmusi Maimane in August, we have a signed resignation letter from her."  As the said letter did the rounds on Twitter, De Lille took to the social media platform to point out that the letter is addressed to Maimane.  "It is not my formal resignation letter to the Speaker," De Lille wrote. A mayor's resignation letter must be addressed to the Speaker to carry official status.  "If anyone of you asks me: 'Are you going to resign on the 31st?' I'm going to tell you to wait for the 31st," she said on Monday. News24 understands that the DA will bring another motion of no confidence in her if she fails to vacate her office. De Lille and Herron have both questioned the reports' credibility and insisted on their innocence.  Herron tweeted on Tuesday evening that he welcomes the investigation.
