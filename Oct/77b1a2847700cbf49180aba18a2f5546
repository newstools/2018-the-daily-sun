POLICE arrested four suspects and recovered 26 cows that were allegedly stolen in Mozambique. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said an operation was conducted in Manguzi, northern KZN, on Thursday. “The stolen livestock was positively identified through brand marks. The suspects will be sent back to Mozambique soon,” said Mbele. She said the suspects stole the cattle in Mozambique and crossed the border into South Africa through Mtikini. Mbele said the suspects, who are aged between 18 and 26, will be charged with stock theft and contravention of the Immigration Act. Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the area in August to address the problem of cross-border crime.
