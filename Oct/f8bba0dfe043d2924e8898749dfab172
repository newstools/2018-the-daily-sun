MOTORISTS in Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape, are unhappy with the state of the roads. They says there are no road markings and they claim the municipality uses PVA paint to mark the roads. PVA paint is used to paint houses. One of the motorists, Sinethemba Zokwana, said there were no yellow lines. “It’s as if we are driving in a village. People are getting hit by cars because there are no markings to show where to walk or park cars,” said Sinethemba. Sinazo Bambeni accused the municipality of not taking them seriously. “The PVA paint they use is washed away by the rain. “Maybe we need to protest to get them to do the right thing,” he said. Mlungisi Nqeketho, a taxi driver, says commuters blame them for driving badly. “Everything is blamed on us. But the municipality should take the blame because they fooled everyone by using PVA instead of the right paint,” said Mlungisi. The SunTeam walked around Lusikisiki town and witnessed the chaos. There were no road markings to direct pedestrians and motorists. Spokesman for Ingquza Hill Municipality, Zamuxolo Mathwasa, denied allegations that they had used PVA paint for road makings. “We don’t use PVA. Maybe it’s the way the road was constructed during apartheid,” said Mathwasa. He said they sometimes hire contractors for road construction. “Maybe the quality of the paint they use looks like PVA, but it’s definitely not PVA because we did follow-ups,” he insisted. He said they will fix the roads during the festive season.
