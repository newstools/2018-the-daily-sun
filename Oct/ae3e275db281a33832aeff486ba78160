AMAZULU midfielder Nhlanhla Vilakazi says the players have done everything right – the only thing that’s missing is luck. Usuthu are currently at the bottom of the Absa Premiership table with three points from eight games. This comes after the KwaZulu-Natal outfit were docked six points by the Premier Soccer League (PSL) on Fifa’s instructions for not complying with a Fifa ruling and failing to pay Namibian player Phineas Nambandi after unlawfully terminating his contract in 2014. Although Usuthu have since paid their debt, the docked points cannot be reversed, which leaves them in a position no club wishes to be in, as it’s always a mission to climb up the table. Vilakazi, who has cemented his place in the AmaZulu setup following his move from Free State Stars at the end of last season, says there’s no need for them to panic. He insists that by the end of the first round they will be among the top teams in the league. “We have been on top of our game since the league started. The only thing we need is luck,” said Vilakazi. Cavin Johnson’s charges have managed to find the back of the net seven times in eight games. But they’ve conceded 11 goals, which is a concern. Vilakazi explained: “For us to move up we need to collect as many points as we can. The only way to do that is by scoring goals, which has been a bit of a challenge for us.” The former Ajax Cape Town player urged his teammates not to expect only strikers to score. With the international break coming up this week, AmaZulu will be back in action on the weekend of 20-21 October when they host Cape Town City FC in Telkom Knockout round of 16. “Everyone in the team should contribute to scoring. Nowadays it’s no longer about relying on strikers for goals.”
