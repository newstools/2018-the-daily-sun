FOR the past two years, life has not been easy for the Adams family. The family faced tough times after their house was burnt down in Westenburg outside Polokwane, Limpopo. The family of 15 had to share a temporary two-roomed shack and that was difficult for them. But on Friday the family’s struggle came to an end after Multi-Spectrum Property, with the help of other companies, handed over an eight-roomed house. Polokwane mayor Thembi Nkadimeng said it was shocking to see the family’s struggle every day. She told Daily Sun paper that she is happy that the donors and the municipality have made the famiy’s dream come true. “The Adams’ family story was touching, especially in winter as they had to face the cold front,” Nkadimeng said. “It’s crucial we ensure that proper services are delivered to our struggling people,” she said. “This house belongs to gogo Adams. “No one should harass her in her home.” Gogo Christina Adams (65) said life has been difficult ever since their house was destroyed by fire. “But today we are happy because we have been given a new house.” She said they were grateful to God for bringing the Good Samaritans into their lives. “Without the Lord we wouldn’t have this house. “I prayed every day to ensure that my family got a proper house. “It was heartbreaking to see my children suffering,” she said. “We thank everyone who helped to build this beautiful house for us. Now we will live in dignity,” said gogo Christina.
