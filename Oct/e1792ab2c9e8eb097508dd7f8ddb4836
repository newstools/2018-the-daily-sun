EVERY day, Sanele Gina prays for the safe return of his kids and baby mama. The 23-year-old told Daily Sun his shack felt cold and empty ever since his kids and lover went missing earlier this month. Sanele, from Ehlathini in Mariannhill, Durban, said he didn’t know if his baby mama Nqobile Dube (23) and his kids Nqubeko (5) and Sithandiwe Gina (2) were still alive. Nqobile and the kids disappeared on 6 October, apparently after he had asked her to stop taking snuff. Sanele did not approve of her new habit. He returned from work that day to an empty house. “Five months ago I discovered that she was taking snuff,” said Sanele. “I asked her to stop taking snuff because I was worried that it would make her sick.” He said on the night before she vanished, he and Nqobile had argued after he found out she was still taking it. “I think she got upset with me,” he said. “I’ve looked for her everywhere but no one knows where she went. “She took her clothes and R600 but left her cellphone behind. “Even her family in Mtubatuba don’t know where they are. “I’ve searched in hospitals and at mortuaries but found no trace of them.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said police were appealing for help to trace Nqobile and Sanele’s two kids. “Anyone with information is requested to contact Mariannhill police on 031 791 3296 or 078 496 1527,” Mbele told the People Paper.
