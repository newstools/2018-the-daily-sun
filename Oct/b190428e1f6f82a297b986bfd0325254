THEY say life is about second chances . . . And Thandani “Bibo” Ntshumayelo couldn’t agree more. Back in training after serving a two-year drug ban, Ntshumayelo looks set to sign with Bidvest Wits, who have shown interest in acquiring his services. “We have to give the boy a chance. Everybody deserves a second chance,” said Wits coach Gavin Hunt. “It’s important. We can’t write off people who’ve made mistakes in life. We all make mistakes.” Hunt has a soft spot for Ntshumayelo, the two having worked together before at SuperSport United. “He’s training, he’s running. We have to get him fit. “His attitude is right, which is the most important thing. I’m happy for him. I’m going to give him a run in a friendly. We’ll see how it goes,” Hunt said. The coach added that he would use the Fifa break to prepare for their upcoming Telkom Knockout round of 16 fixture against Free State Stars. As defending champions, the Students are naturally under pressure to impress in the current edition. Hunt’s biggest fear is crashing out in the first round. He reasons that this would mean his team would be playing fewer competitive matches in November, possibly losing momentum. “It’s the same every year, we already know the programme. You have the Fifa break and then you have another one, then it’s the Knockout Challenge. “So if you get knocked out in the first round then you have a problem. It means you will not be playing that much football in the month of November.” This is Wits’ first cup competition this season after they missed out on the MTN8. But Hunt reckons they have been handed a tough draw against Ea Lla Koto, who are struggling to get into gear in the league. Said Hunt: “Let’s try and win the first game. It won’t be easy. Stars are a good side and come from a good result at the weekend. “Coming back from a Fifa break is always difficult. “We have seven players away (on national team duty). Stars don’t have a lot of players away.”
