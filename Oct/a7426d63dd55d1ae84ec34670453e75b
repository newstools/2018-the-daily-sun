PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will face mounting pressure if he
doesn’t fire Bathabile Dlamini by Friday. This is according to the DA’s Shadow Minister of Social
Development, Bridget Masango who said Dlamini should do the honourable thing
and resign. Masango was speaking after laying a charge of perjury against
Dlamini for allegedly lying to the Constitutional Court and a charge of gross
negliglence at the Joburg Central Police Station. “Please just do the right thing and release the Minister,” said
Masango. “We have given the president until Friday to fire the minister
given the harshness, scathing and very strong judgment handed down against
her.” Masango said although many charges had been laid before this time
it will be different. She said: “We know there have been many efforts to hold many
ministers and public officials that have not yielded any results, but we not
going to rest until we use every avenue and every mechanism that is within the
law.” She said they were confident the courts will do the right thing
and investigate the charges so that the minister can be held accountable at
least in this case.” The charges follow the judgment in which the Constitutional Court
requested that the NPA consider if Dlamini should be prosecuted for lying under
oath during her testimony at the Judge Bernard Ngoepe Inquiry into the social
grants crisis. Last week the ConCourt branded the Minister as reckless and
grossly negligent. Masango said: “Dlamini can no longer run away from accountability.
The DA will continue to explore all avenues to make sure she has her day in
court.”
