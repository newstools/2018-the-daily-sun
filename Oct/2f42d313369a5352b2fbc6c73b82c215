The Mopani District Municipality is currently engaging
the Lepelle Northern Water in a bit to ensure that water supply is fully
restored in the tourism town of Phalaborwa and its surrounding townships. This is after Lepelle Northern Water reduced water supply
to the area by 30 percent. District Municipality spokesperson Witness Tiva said the
water has been reduced for the past two days. "As the district municipality we are determined to
ensure that we continue to service the debt we are having with Lepelle Northern
Water. It is important to take note that as the district municipality we are
doing our best to ensure that the historic debt is being settled as soon as
possible, " said Ntiva. He also acknowledged that the Constitution of the
republic has placed a legal obligation on them to realise people’s right to
sufficient water, hence they are continuing to engage Lepelle Northern Water to
find a long lasting solution. “We would like to take this opportunity to apologise for
the inconvenience caused by this unfortunate turn of events in the
Ba-Phalaborwa municipal area. In addition, we are also engaging all the five
local municipalities under our district municipality encouraging them to
strengthen their revenue collections so that they can pay us the millions of
rand they are owing". He said  this will
enable them to speedily pay off debt with the Lepelle Northern Water.
