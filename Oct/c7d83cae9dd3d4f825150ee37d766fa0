A CIVIL society group is demanding that pastor Timothy Omotoso’s church be shut down. More than 300 members of Nelson Mandela Bay Citizens in Unity protested outside Jesus Dominion International Church in North End, Port Elizabeth. There was a scuffle between members of the packed church and residents who called the building a brothel. Police intervened before things could get out of hand. Omotoso, the senior pastor of the church, is facing 97 charges of human trafficking, rape and sexual assault. Protest leader Misumzi Gqalane told Daily Sun they were not there to criticise Christianity. “We cannot fold our arms while our children are being abused by people who call themselves pastors,” he said. A senior church member said: “We are not going anywhere. This church belongs to us. “If we leave, where are we going to worship? Omotoso is the leader, not the owner, of the church. These people must leave us alone so that we can worship God in peace.” He urged the protesters to let the law take its course. The church eventually decided to call off the service after the Port Elizabeth branch of the church was temporarily shut down. After ownership and zoning verifications were done the municipality confirmed that the building was not meant for use as a church. The banner on the outside of the building will be removed today. Omotoso’s trial will continue this morning in the Port Elizabeth High Court.
