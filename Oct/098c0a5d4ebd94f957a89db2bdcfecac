Mzansi has praised witness Cheryl Zondi for her bravery during her testimony at the trial of rape accused pastor Timothy Omotoso. Cheryl remained calm and confident and Judge Mandela Makaula blocked the line of questioning the Pastor's lawyer was pursuing. The 22-year-old is one of one of a group of girls who have accused the pastor of sexual assault and rape. Cheryl is expected to wrap up her testimony on Tuesday. The Nigerian pastorâ€™s trial continues in the High court in Port Elizabeth. Omotoso and his co-accused, Lusanda Sulani (36) and Zukiswa Sitho (28), face 97 charges of sexual assault, rape and human trafficking Mzansi people took to Twitter to congratulate Cheryl for being brave throughout her testimony. She is my hero....(deliberately chose not to use heroine). We love you girl...the country is behind you. We praying for you. Stay strong! #CherylZondi #OmotosoTrial pic.twitter.com/P1ZqdfecdL I believe #CherylZondi. What a brave young woman.  I'm in awe of #CherylZondi 's strength and bravery. I can only imagine the difficulty of having to re-live and narrate such a painful and horrific experience - but she has done it with great dignity and poise. Wishing her more strength #OmotosoTrial  I must say I admire the strength displayed by #CherylZondi. I almost broke when a person who doesn't even know her invalidated her experiences with this sociopath but she is able to contain herself and soldier on. #OmotosoTrial pic.twitter.com/76gaONUEE4  Talk about beauty with brains ??????I believe you I will stand by you #CherylZondi #OmotosoTrial pic.twitter.com/qgmcB62iqo #CherylZondi I'm really proud of this girl... what a brave... smart young lady #Omotoso We are #CherylZondi in her we see strength and Power. #OmotosoTrial pic.twitter.com/P0u7fiBKlD  I am proud of you girl, for standing up for yourself.
