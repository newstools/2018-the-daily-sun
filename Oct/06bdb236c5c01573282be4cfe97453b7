AFTER serving people for 100 years, the Jeppe Street Clinic in Joburg central is closing down for good. Renovations that cost R3 million failed to end health risks to staff and patients. Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa announced this in a written reply to DA Gauteng shadow health MEC Jack Bloom. According to Bloom, Ramakgopa said management decided to close the clinic because infrastructure issues identified previously had resurfaced and still posed a health risk. The clinic will be permanently closed from 4pm today. Bloom said clinic staff would be relocated to the 18th Avenue Clinic in Alexandra and patients redirected to Esselen Clinic and Hillbrow Community Health Centre, both in Hillbrow. Bloom said the Jeppe Street Clinic was first closed in 2012 for a R2 million renovation, completed in March 2014. When problems resurfaced, including mouldy walls, it was closed in March last year and reopened in November after R990 000 was spent to fix it. Bloom said: “This department is notorious for choosing building companies that charge too much and fail to deliver, with strong signs of corruption”. He said the closure would affect the 2 500 patients who used it every month.
