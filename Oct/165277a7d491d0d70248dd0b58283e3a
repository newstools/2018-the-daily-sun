RESIDENTS have had enough of the killers who walk among them after six women were killed in Sicelo kasi, Meyerton in the Midvaal Municipality. The women were brutally raped and strangled and their bodies were found dumped in the bush. Angry residents gathered in their hundreds early yesterday morning to hunt for the thugs believed to be behind the murders. They targeted all-night taverns and known drug dealers. Shacks where they believed thugs operated were demolished in the raids. Community leader Koena Mokoena told Daily Sun: “Our raid follows the killing of our sisters. We are in a manhunt for people who are selling drugs, for all night drinking holes and most importantly, those killers operating among us.” Mokoena said cops were not investigating or busting killers and failed to keep the murdered women’s families informed about their cases. “We will continue these raids until we find the suspects.” Another resident said the raids were unfair. “We understand the residents are gatvol but some of the raided shacks are people’s homes. “Imagine coming home and finding your shack demolished because it was locked and suspected of holding criminals.” ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule is expected to visit the area today as part of the party’s campaign to take the Midvaal Municipality away from the DA in the coming election. Captain Fikile Funda denied reports of a serial killer in the area, but said police were investigating all the murders. “We don’t encourage people to take the law into their own hands. “Police are working around the clock to monitor tavern operating times to prevent crime. “Our investigators are working hard on all cases,” Funda said.
