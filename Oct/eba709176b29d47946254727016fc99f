SHE saved for years and then resigned from her job to build her dream home. However, Portia Ngcane was left living in a garage with seven family members after a builder allegedly scammed her. The 48-year-old from Atteridgeville, Tshwane, told Daily Sun the builder was introduced to her by the person who drew up her house plans. She was impressed with him after he built her a garage in just a month. She said in December, the builder told her he could finish the house by February and she gave him money to buy building materials. “In December, I gave him R145 000 and by the end of January, I had paid the balance totalling R320 000. That was when he started ducking and diving,” she said. “I would call him to ask when he would start work but he kept on postponing.” Portia said she finally decided to go to the police when she realised he was not going to build the home. “The cops told me they couldn’t open a case as it was not a criminal matter. As it involved too much money for Small Claims Court, I signed an agreement with him at the police station but he has still not fulfilled it,” she said. Portia said she thought she would be living in her dream home by now but her whole family was squashed into a tiny garage. When the SunTeam contacted the builder, Sipho Hladia he said he was aware he needed to build a home for Portia. He said he had problems with other people he owed money. “As soon as I’m on my feet, I will build for her. I’m not running away.”
