NOT all matric pupils are looking forward to writing the first paper of their final exam tomorrow. Matric pupils at Gqokubukhosi High School in Melmoth, northern KZN are not excited about the exams. They are going to write certain subjects despite not having had teachers. Among the subjects they spent several months not being taught are Zulu, English, maths and life orientation. A pupil said: “Our school had a very rough year. We only have four teachers. In some of the grades, including matric, certain subjects are not being taught.” A parent (44) said: “We have held a number of meetings with the teachers and SGB to try to resolve the issue, but with no luck. “We are are now praying to God to help our kids succeed.” KZN education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said: “We will ask the district to give us a report on this matter. “These are disturbing allegations.”
