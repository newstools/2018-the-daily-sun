The Khumalo sisters, Kelly and Zandie, got to hang out with US R&B legend Brandy when they performed at the Macufe Festival in Bloemfontein. Both Kelly and Zandie were at the event, even getting the opportunity to share the stage. After their performance the singers got to meet Brandy backstage who was in awe of their singing. In a clip shared by Zandie, you can hear fans still singing along to her and Kelly's performance after they left the stage. "Who was on stage singing?" Brandy asks, to which Zandie replies: "Us." "You guys sound amazing," the US star goes on to say, eventually asking Kelly and Zandie if she can take a picture with them.
