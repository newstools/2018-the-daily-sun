     Cheryl Zondi, one of the girls who accused controversial
Durban-based pastor, Timothy Omotoso of rape is on the stand. Zondi has told the court that the first time she went to
Omotoso’s house, she was taken to his bedroom. “I didn’t want to die, so I went to his room. He was in the
bed with an unbuttoned shirt. I knelt down beside him. He told me to join him in bed. He
was fondling his private parts under the covers. I thought he was going to rape
me,” Zondi told the court. Zondi said following that he told her to go clean herself up
and come back to bed, he then reportedly fell asleep. She said when Omotoso woke up he prayed asking God for
forgiveness for both of them. “As if I was part of the filthy thing he did. He said it was
a covenant between me, him and God. Not to tell anyone,” she said. Meanwhile Mzansi took to social media to voice their anger
of the cross examination of Zondi by Omotoso’s attorney Peter Daubermann. Omotoso, Zukiswa Sitho (28) and Lusanda Solani (36) are
facing charges of racketeering, violating the sexual offences act, human
trafficking and rape. The senior pastor at the Jesus Dominion International Church
has been in prison since his arrest in April last year. He was denied bail twice after it came to light that he was
a flight risk. Lusanda and Zukiswa, who are accused of recruiting, grooming
and monitoring the movements of girls for the pastor, are out on R2 000 bo
voice ail each. Omotoso’s lawyer, Advocate Peter Dauberman, said the charge
sheets do not specify the date, time or areas where the alleged offences took
place. Therefore he wanted the court to nullify all the charges
against the accused.
