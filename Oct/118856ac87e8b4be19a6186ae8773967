Cansi Nyalungu has been applying for an ID with no success. For the past five years, Nyalungu (34) said, he has been trying to get an ID and it is becoming a nightmare. Nyalungu from Belfast Village, near Mkhuhlu in Mpumalanga, recently visited Home Affairs after he applied during the department’s outreach programme. “I got shocking news when I visited Thulamahashe Home Affairs,” he said. “They told me the system says I’m not South African and they noticed my ID number has been blocked. “This news that I’m an illegal immigrant hurt me because both my parents and siblings had South African IDs. I’m the only one without one. “I was born and bred in this village and South Africa is the only place I know. “I’m the eldest and I’m supposed to support my siblings but can’t do that because no one will hire me without an ID.” Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said there have been cases in the past where IDs were obtained fraudulently. But they were now able to detect such documents.
