THE big guns were kept apart in the Telkom Knockout Last 16 draw yesterday. Even unseeded Bidvest Wits, the defending champions, avoided the PSL powerhouses as they were paired with Free State Stars. But fans and football stakeholders will be hoping for some upsets, thrills and spills in the 2018/19 opening round Knockout Challenge fixtures. Last season’s runners-up Bloemfontein Celtic will be visiting 2015/16 champions Mamelodi Sundowns. Polokwane City will be home to SuperSport United while Cape Town City, the 2016/17 runners-up, will be visiting AmaZulu, whose success in this tournament last came in 1992. Orlando Pirates will have to overcome former coach Eric Tinkler after they were pitted against Chippa United. The Buccaneers have won the knockout just ONCE since the tournament was first launched as the Datsun Challenge, back in 1982. And that’s a staggering statistic! But Micho said he will be hoping for a better result this time. Kaizer Chiefs, the most successful team with 13 titles, have also been handed a favourable draw, a home fixture against Black Leopards. Amakhosi are yet to win a trophy in four seasons now and pressure is on Giovanni Solinas to break the trophy less run. The first fixtures will take place on the weekend of 20-21 October. Mosimane said he is targeting the Knockout after the shortcoming in the top-eight, while Komphela is looking to cap his fantastic start at Celtic with a first ever trophy.
