A TAXI man has been in pain since he was allegedly shot with a rubber bullet by a Metro cop on Tuesday morning. The 45-year-old father of four from Samora Machel in Philippi, Cape Town, said the trouble started when he skipped a red light while driving from Century City to Mitchell’s Plain. “I saw a Metro cop following me and I tried to speed off, hoping he’d turn back. “But he kept following me. I then got out of my taxi and fled on foot,” he said. “I was worried I would be arrested, because I have outstanding warrants. But I am busy paying the fines.” He said he ran to the garage in Manenberg, but he was caught. “The cop told me to lie on my stomach and he handcuffed me. I then heard the sound of a gun being loaded,” he said. “He shot me in the back with a rubber bullet. He then told me I should never drive like that again. “He told me to get into his car. “He dropped me off a few metres from where he had shot me.” The taxi man then went to Manenberg Police Station and gave police the registration number of the cop car. “They called the cop and he offered to take me to the hospital, but I refused,” said the taxi man. He said the cops called an ambulance and he was taken to hospital, but he was discharged the same day. “I have not opened a case because I am still angry. I want to calm down first,” said the taxi man. Cape Town safety and security director Richard Bosman confirmed a shooting incident had been reported. Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said he could comment only once a case had been formally opened.
