RESIDENTS of Kokstad, southern KZN braved the cold weather on Wednesday to see President Cyril Ramaphosa. He officially opened a bigger Home Affairs office in the Kokstad CBD. He then went to Franklin area, where he handed over title deeds to more than 400 families. According to residents of Kokstad, they have been complaining about the small office at the Home Affairs for a long time. Ntombizethu Jiba (44) said: “Whenever we needed Home Affairs services, we were forced to queue outside the building because the office was so small. “It was worse during rainy, cold days. But now we are relieved because the office has been renovated. Waiting in long queues outside the building will be a thing of the past.” Residents of Franklin were also happy to get their title deeds. Madala Tseko Jiba (83) said they had lived in the RDPs since 2010, but didn’t have title deeds. “Even though we were grateful that we had houses, we were not entirely satisfied because we knew that without title deeds, our ownership was incomplete.” Ramaphosa said: “I’m happy to be here and interact with residents. “They told me the service offered by the employees at the Home Affairs office was good, except that they were operating in a small office. I think everything from now on will feel better. “The issue of space has been taken care of. “I am also happy that Franklin residents will now have full ownership of the houses they have lived in for several years.”
