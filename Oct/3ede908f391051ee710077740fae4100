RESIDENTS of Folweni, south of Durban, claim rubbish in their kasi hasn’t been collected for about 10 months. They said they spoke to the councillor about their problem, but their pleas fell on deaf ears. Now residents dump rubbish in empty spaces. A resident said they didn’t have a choice but to dump rubbish everywhere. “We’ve reported to Councillor Thokozani Xulu that rubbish hasn’t been collected for about 10 months, but he couldn’t help us.” Another resident, Silindile Mbambo (31) said: “Last week the councillor released a report claiming that our area was rubbish free. “We were all shocked because rubbish is piling up and he is aware of the problem.” Silindile said they were angry with the councillor because he lied. Nkosi Gumede (38) said: “The councillor is blocking service delivery in our area. He also claimed we have a mobile library, but it’s not true. We’ve never had a library. Our kids are forced to travel to town or areas such as Umlazi to access the library.” “We asked eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede to come and see for herself how dirty our area has become.” Councillor Xulu said: “I might have made a few errors in my report but I’m not accountable to you. I’m also not going to respond to your questions.” Zandile Gumede, a spokeswoman for mayor Gumede, said the municipality would intervene.
