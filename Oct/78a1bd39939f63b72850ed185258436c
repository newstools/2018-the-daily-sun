The expected sentencing of Fees Must Fall activist Bonginkosi Khanyile was postponed on Tuesday to allow for the drafting of expert reports. The matter was adjourned until January next year for probation officer and correctional supervision reports to be handed to the court. These will guide the sentencing process. Earlier this year, the Durban University of Technology student was convicted on charges of public violence‚ failing to comply with a police instruction and possession of a dangerous weapon, relating to a wave of violent protests in 2016 linked to the Fees Must Fall campaign. Khanyile made certain admissions - that he had disturbed the public peace‚ used a slingshot to stone police and ignored their pleas to disperse - which led to him being convicted by Durban Regional Court Magistrate Siphiwe Hlophe. The magistrate found that, on September 27, 2016, Khanyile committed the crime of public violence and intentionally struck the police with stones using a slingshot. He further found that, on February 4 that year, Khanyile had participated in a public gathering at DUT and had failed to comply with a police instruction to disperse. The magistrate ruled that the slingshot was a dangerous weapon, capable of hurting someone. Khanyile was acquitted of nine other related charges. The trial took two years to get underway after several postponements. He remains out on bail.
