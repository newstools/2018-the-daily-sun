A MAN was removed from his home on Friday for his own safety after allegedly raping his neighbour’s cat! Prem Balram, spokesman for private security company Reaction Unit South Africa, said the man had to be rescued from angry residents who were baying for his blood. Balram said their operations centre received a call from a woman in Verulam, KZN, who informed the controller on duty her neighbour was having sex with her pet cat. “The woman told us she walked to the man’s house to investigate the screams of her pet when she found the naked man holding the cat by its rear legs and penetrating it with his 4-5,” he said. When his officers arrived, the woman informed them she wanted the man removed from the premises. “Officers entered the man’s home and found the man dressing. His pants were covered in cat’s hair,” said Balram. “The man was removed from the property after the neighbours voiced concerns about the safety of children living in the area.” According to residents, the man had been previously caught red-handed having sex with a dog and other cats. “This matter was not reported after the suspect’s lover pleaded for forgiveness,” said Balram. He said his officers located the cat and found it had suffered injuries. Social media users also vented their anger after news of the incident went viral. Sammy Chetty said on Facebook: “This man needs to be evaluated and kept far away from animals and people.” Khairunisa Sheik said: “From animals it could move on to kids.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said no case had been opened.
