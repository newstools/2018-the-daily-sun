A WOMAN had to endure vile treatment at the hands of a
racist while flying home from holiday. To add insult to injury, she was then made to move seats
away from the angry white man who had acted so horrifically! Watch the footage below! According to the Sun, Mrs Gayle (77) was travelling home on
Thursday with her daughter from Spain to her home in London, England after
enjoying a holiday. Her unnamed daughter (53) told the Huffington Post:
"In a few weeks, it’ll be one year since my dad died and I took my mum
away for a few days’ break. “She’s been
feeling really down and depressed, so I thought the trip would raise her
spirits. "The underlying reason behind the man’s abusive
behaviour comes down to the fact that my mum is a black woman and he didn’t
want her sitting next to him." She added: "I know that if I was behaving like he
was or any other black person, for that matter, police would’ve been called and
we would’ve been kicked off of the flight. “Mum’s really feeling upset and very stressed about this
situation, on top of the grief that she’s already experiencing. “We will never fly with Ryanair again.” David Lawrence, who filmed the incident with this phone,
told Washington Post: “I heard this man shouting at this woman, saying, ‘You’re
in my way. Get out! I don’t want you here next to me!’” “I couldn’t believe what I heard." The racist bully can be heard calling her “an ugly, black
bastard”. The airline, Ryanair, says it has reported the matter to
the cops.
