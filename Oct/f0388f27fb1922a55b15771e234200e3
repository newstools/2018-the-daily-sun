NQUTHU residents plan to march against a chief who fines bachelors. Inkosi Thathezakhe Ngobese allegedly fines unmarried men in villages near the northern KZN town R50 a year and now they are gatvol. Crisis committee chairman Elliot Nkosi yesterday told Daily Sun people could not take it any more and were ready to show their anger on the streets. He said all unmarried men over 21 were fined and residents had to listen to the chief as if he were God. He said they took it up with traditional affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube, who sent a team to investigate. Nkosi said they would have a big march if the MEC failed to act. He said the inkosi sent local indunas to collect the money and those who did not pay were not allowed to have traditional functions or weddings. “We have been quiet for long and now is the time for people to stand up against Ngobese. People cannot be treated like this after 24 years of democracy.” Nkosi said children born out of wedlock were not welcome in the village and men were fined a bull for getting girls pregnant before marriage. Ngobese said each village had its rules and asked why traditional leaders could not fine people who did not respect them. Co-operative governance and traditional affairs spokesman Lennox Mabaso said his department would act after receiving a report from the relevant officials.
