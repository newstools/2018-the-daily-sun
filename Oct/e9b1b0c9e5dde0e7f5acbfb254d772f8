Good luck to all the member Clubs left in the competition.” Telkom Head of Sponsorships Braam Wessels said: “When we announced the fixtures a couple of weeks ago, fans were already guessing and anticipating on where the venue of the cup final would be.  I believe there’s no better place than Nelson Mandela Bay, in the friendly city itself.
