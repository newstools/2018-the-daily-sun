A MOTORCYCLIST ended up in hospital with a damaged eye after
being moered in the face by a cop – for not paying a bribe. According to Punch, Abraham Agbo makes a living
transporting passengers on his motorbike in Ebonyi State, southern Nigeria. Last Thursday, he was pulled over by a cop sergeant named
as Pius Okwor while riding on a busy road with two passengers. Okwor allegedly demanded that Abraham pay him a N50
(about R2) bribe. When Abraham refused, Okwor allegedly smashed his cop
baton across Abraham’s eyes, causing one in particular to become badly damaged. Abraham’s brother, Isaac Agbo, told Punch: “When the cops
realised that they had injured my brother, they fled the scene. “Sympathisers, however, put my brother on the motorcycle
and chased the policemen to their station at the Ohaukwu Police Division. “They met the station commander and explained what
happened to him. He showed his displeasure at the officer and ordered him to
take my brother to a hospital. “But we want the officer to be removed or punished as he
is fond of extorting money and assaulting people plying that route.” Isaac also said Okwor hadn’t paid the hospital bills,
leaving the family to exhaust all their savings doing so. Cops were unavailable for comment at the time Punch
published the story.
