Pienaar cops in Mpumalanga are appealing to residents to help the Mavuso family find their missing daughter. Samkelisiwe Mavuso disappeared from home in Mphakatsi last month. Police police spokeswoman Captain Jabu Ndubane said Samkelisiwe (23) went to the toilet in the morning and never came back. Ndubane said the family told police that Samkelisiwe has a mental illness. They said she often disappeared but later came back home. “The family got worried when she hadn’t returned home that day and they reported her missing,” said Ndubane. “We’re calling on anyone who might have any information about Samkelisiwe’s whereabouts to contact cops.” There were rumours that Samkelisiwe was seen in Msholozi, near White River. “But no one came forward to alert the police.” Anyone with info should call 076 432 7038 or 079 232 2091.
