CARO Xaba is worried about the whereabouts of her niece, Sibongile Mahlangu (17), who went missing on 5 October in Stinkwater, Tshwane. Caro (35) from Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, told Daily Sun Sibongile was slightly mentally challenged and extremely forgetful. She said even though she was a teenager, she behaved like a child. “Her sister sent her to a local shop to buy bread. On the way she lost the R100 she was given. When her sister went to look for her she found her sitting on the side of the road. “Sibongile thought her sister would beat her up and ran away.” Caro said on the day of her disappearance, Sibongile was wearing purple tights, a pink T-shirt and pink plastic shoes. “We’ve looked for her everywhere but she’s nowhere to be found.” Caro said this had severely affected the family as her mum was struggling to eat and sleep. She said in her desperation to find Sibongile, her mum had consulted a sangoma on Saturday who told her Sibongile would come home and was being kept by someone in the area. Caro told the SunTeam Sibongile had also gone missing last May and was found in New Eersterust in Tshwane with a mentally ill man. Police spokeswoman Captain Sarah Lesabane said a missing person’s case was opened. Anyone with information is urged to contact Temba Warrant Officer Lucas Mahamba on 081 845 8072.
