TWO trucks crashed into each other and a third one was pushed
off the road. The dashcam footage shared on a Facebook page called SA
TRUCKERS, shows two trucks colliding head-on. In the video, the trucks can be seen on the road going the
opposite direction as the truck behind the one with the dashcam, tries to
overtake. Following that, the truck trying to overtake crashes into
the other truck and the third truck is pushed to the side of the road. The accident reportedly occurred on Friday, on the road between Bethal
to Kriel in Mpumalanga. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande has called on motorists to
be on vigilant and avoid risks of being involved in accidents. Nzimande said government is investing a lot of resources to
reduce road crashes and fatalities but government alone cannot win this war if
road users are not obeying the rules of the road.
