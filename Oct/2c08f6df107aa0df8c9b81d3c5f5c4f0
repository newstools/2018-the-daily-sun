POLICE Minister Bheki Cele praised the team that caught 12 cash-in-transit suspects at a house in Midrand on Friday. The team, made up of crime intelligence, the Hawks, forensic experts and other units, acted on a tip-off and pounced on the suspects. “Proactive arrests are a clear sign of the police’s commitment to fighting crime. This is the result of the national crime prevention strategy, which is now in full force,” said police spokesman Vishnu Naidoo. Naidoo said the suspects were found in possession of firearms and ammunition. Cele said cash-in-transit crimes directly affected the economy and perpetrators must be brought to book. He said the state’s authority must be felt and heard. “The ministry and police service are mandated by the Constitution to prevent, combat and investigate crime,’ said Cele. “We take the mandate seriously and will uphold it at all times.” A case of conspiracy to commit robbery, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition and of suspected stolen motor vehicles was opened. “We continue to call on residents to walk with us toe to toe, by reporting suspicious behaviour or acts of crime,” Cele said.
