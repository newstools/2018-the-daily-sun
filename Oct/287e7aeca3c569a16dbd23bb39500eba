SIYABULELA Vanzi’s 4-5 is on a go-slow. The 36-year-old man said his performance in bed has been on strike for the past three years. He has been to the Men’s Clinic but his 4-5 has still failed him. The desperate man from Wattville, Ekurhuleni, now needs help from a sangoma to help him with his 4-5. He said he was last with a woman a year ago and things didn’t end well. “Last year I found someone. We abstained for three months. When we finally had sex, my 4-5 stopped working. That was the last time I saw her.” Siyabulela told Daily Sun  his troubles started when he broke up with a Pedi woman. He said they had been in love for three years. “I think the person who did this wanted to ensure I didn’t cheat. I’ve always been a one-woman man and had no desire to cheat,” he said. Siyabulela said he felt as if he was being punished for other men’s problems. He said he has only had two girlfriends since his 4-5 went strike. Siyabulela said his friends told him he had been bewitched and needed to see a sangoma. Traditional healer Dungamazi Nsindini said Siyabulela was either ignoring a call from the ancestors or he had been bewitched. “He should come to my place and I will throw bones and see which one it is,” said Dungamanzi. He also advised people who were having the same problem not to ignore it.
