RESIDENTS beat up a cellphone thug. This was after he stole a cellphone out of a taxi in Doornfontein, Joburg over the weekend. A taxi driver who was driving behind the taxi stopped and chased him. Everyone helped by chasing the thug. He was caught and moered. Residents are pleased that such thugs are being dealt with. They said it would be a warning to other thugs. Cynthia Mngomezulu (36) said: “Joburg is the worst place when it comes to crime. “I’m just happy that people are working together to stop these thugs. “I hope this sends a strong message to others.” Lusanda Madlala (26) said she went through the same ordeal some years ago. She added that she was happy someone was finally doing something about it. “I have been a victim of this kind of attack. Some guy snatched my phone and ran. “No one did anything about it, and I did not open a case because I did not see his face clearly.” Hillbrow police spokesman Sergeant Mduduzi Zondo strongly condemned mob justice. “The suspect stole the phone of a student from the University of Joburg. “A case of theft was opened. The suspect will appear in court as soon as he gets out of hospital,” he said.
