HE has dated more than 30 women since 2009. But it’s not because he is such a hot lover! All the women the 35-year-old man from Soweto has dated have dumped him after only a few days. His longest relationship lasted all of three days. He told Daily Sun the women left because when they had sex with him, they pushed him away and told him there was something else in the room. “They all complain of seeing a creepy female tokoloshe standing next to the bed!” He said sangomas told him the creature was a tokoloshe. “I have visited sangomas, inyangas, churches and prophets but nothing has helped.” He told Daily Sun the tokoloshe has even taken over his bed. “It sleeps with me and I can’t take it anymore.” He said the jealous tokoloshe wanted him all to herself. “Women like me but when it comes to sex it’s always a disaster. “I need to have my own woman one day and have kids.” The tormented man, who is a cop, said one of the sangomas claimed he had been cursed by an ex-girlfriend he dumped in 2009 after she cheated on him. Because of the curse women have been dumping him. “His ex must have taken his underwear or sperm to curse him,” said sangoma Emily Mdau. “He needs a strong sangoma to cast a spell and take away the curse of the tokoloshe.”
