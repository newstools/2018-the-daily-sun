THE moment the truck stopped, the looters moved in! On Monday at 9am, the driver of the truck carrying a load of yoghurt stopped at a traffic light on the corner of Grobler and Market Streets in Polokwane, Limpopo. He got out when he thought the truck was losing its load. In the 45-second video clip posted on social platforms, people are seen swarming all over the truck. The driver gets back into the truck and drives off but the looters follow him into Market Street, where he stops and the looting continues. People then run off carrying boxes of yoghurt, while others remain at the truck. A hair salon worker told Daily Sun said she ran outside when she heard loud screams and joined in. “Christmas comes only once a year and it was just a blessing from God,” she said. “I took two boxes of yoghurt that I shared with my family. “When I left, there were still many people at the truck.” Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said no one has opened a case about the looting of the truck. “We have checked with Polokwane police and they confirmed no case has been opened so far. “We will give an update as soon as the complainant opens a case,” Mojapelo said.
