THE top 20 Miss and Ms Curvybody SA contestants were announced at the Morningside Country Club in Sandton, north of Joburg, on Saturday. Miss Curvybody is open to women aged between 18 and 27. Ms Curvybody is open to women aged between 28 and 39. Curvybody SA CEO Mapule Mphaki said: “We self-funded the organisation. “We had to dig into our pockets to fund any kind of project that we’ve taken.” She said the pageant was aimed at women who’re unfairly treated for their curvaceous bodies. She said they started the movement to help women embrace themselves and feel confident. “More than 90% of the contestants have been body shamed. “We decided to adopt the #NoToBodyShamingAndBullying campaign, which will be rolled out in private and public schools nationwide.” Mapule said it took determination for sponsors to believe in them. Curvybody SA marketing manager Naniwe Maqetuka said they don’t only promote and instil confidence in women but encourage healthy living. “We don’t promote obesity,” said Naniwe. “We also have programmes that promote healthy living. “Body shaming is a big problem among people of all ages.” She said they were organising a #NoToBodyShamingAndBullying fun walk, to be held in East London and Gauteng on 10 November. Reigning Miss Curvybody SA Nokuthula “Tulie” Tanda wished the 2018 contestants luck. One of the finalists, Hellen Mogoba (32) from Limpopo, said: “I’m so excited. It’s a dream come true. “I appreciate who I am and love my body.” Another contestant, Nombulelo Ntuba-Makhapela (31) from Pretoria West told Daily Sun she’s never been bullied. “But whenever I walk in public, men turn their heads,” said Nombulelo. I love it when men admire me. “It shows I’m beautiful and I love it.”
