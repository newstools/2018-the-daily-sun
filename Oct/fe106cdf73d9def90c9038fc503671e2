THE message was signed, sealed and delivered to the Joburg Stock Exchange. Government needs to take action and include predominantly coloured communities in the economy. Yesterday, scores of residents from coloured communities gathered outside the JSE in Sandton in a peaceful protest. The protest was organised by a group called Total Shutdown Gauteng. The demonstrators want President Cyril Ramaphosa to attend to their demands, which include jobs and an end to drug and gang-related violence. Dozens gathered to hand over a letter to JSE executives, outlining companies listed on the stock market which they say are unresponsive to the plight of coloured people. They said they expected answers in seven days. The communities taking part in the demonstration came from Ennerdale, Eldorado Park, Westbury and Eden Park. Total Shutdown spokesman Anthony Williams said one of their requests was a full audit of how many coloured people were employed in all the companies listed. Williams said government needed to be responsible. “We are calling on government and institutions of economic power, including those in Cape Town, to be responsible.” Asked what will happen on Friday, he said they were issuing a letter of demand for Gauteng Premier David Makhura to look into his cabinet. “Makhura can’t be sitting with all kinds of people and no coloured people. When the president appoints the cabinet, they hardly think of appoint any coloured people.” A JSE representative accepted their letter.
