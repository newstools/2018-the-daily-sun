THEY found a piece of their dead baby’s tongue cut out! As if the death of their 18-day-old baby was not devastating enough, his body was given to the parents with body parts missing. Now the parents want answers from the hospital. Lindiwe Buthelezi (39) and Bulelani Diniso (35)’s baby died at Pholosong Hospital in Ekurhuleni. When the body was given to them, they discovered the tip of their baby’s tongue was cut and he had fresh stitches below his rib cage on the right side. The family from Duduza, Ekurhuleni said they wanted hospital staff to be held accountable for their son’s death. “A nurse called me on Friday evening to say my son was dead. She said I should come to the hospital first thing in the morning or else they would burn him. I rushed to the hospital on Saturday morning and asked to identify my son, but the nurse refused and said I couldn’t see him,” said Lindiwe. She said she asked to perform the traditional ceremony of taking her son’s soul from the bed he was sleeping on and the nurse agreed. “She told me to do what I had to, but that I shouldn’t go to the mortuary. I left and contacted my undertaker,” said Lindiwe. She said she only saw on Monday that her baby had stitches on the right side of his lower body and his tongue was cut. “No one wants to tell me what happened to my baby. Even the manner they broke the news to me was uncalled for,” she said. Bulelani was lost for words. “Losing a child is not easy. I am yet to come to terms with this.” Pholosong Hospital spokeswoman Thabisile Mkhwanazi confirmed that Lindiwe had laid a complaint. “We take her concerns seriously and have instituted an investigation.” She said the investigation would be transparent and that they would work with Lindiwe and her family. “We will also secure a date with a psychologist to offer Lindiwe support,” she said.
