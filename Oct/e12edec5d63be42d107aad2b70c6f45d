WHAT a game, what excitement, but no goals! Just lots of smoke but no fire. The lack of goals was the only disappointment as Highlands Park played out a goalless league draw, their fifth this season, at a packed Makhulong Stadium. Highlands demonstrated dashing attacking football, showing little respect for their illustrious opponents. But even as a draw looked a fair result, they should have done better. At home, they felt no need to sit back and let Amakhosi do as they please in their backyard. They revved up pretty quickly and excitingly and should have been 2-0 up by halftime. Mthobi Mvala, of all players, missed a golden chance to score his third goal in third matches, completely missing the ball in his effort to connect with Lindokuhle Mbatha’s cross. Peter Shalulile, playing in his third match this season, couldn’t find the target with a crisp shot early on. Mbatha came close, forcing a fine save from Khune in the 24th minute. On the other end, Dumsani Zuma has a shot blocked on the edge of the box. But the visitors put some enery and physicality into the contest in the second half. It wasn’t as easy a ride as probably anticipated and it wasn’t long before Zuma sent a header inches off target. But the perfect chance would come 20 minutes later when Pule Ekstein failed to beat Tapuwa Kapini. Fed brilliantly by Siphelele Ntshangase with an audacious back-heel, Ekstein did what Ekstein does best! It is these kind of missed chances that have undermined Amakhosi’s great efforts so far this season. Sabelo Nyembe did no better on the other end, leaving a frustrated Owen Da Gama throwing up his hands on the touch line. His counterpart, Giovanni Solinas, was left muttering something in his native Italian as Ekstein, yet again, failed to finish off a brilliant move. The evergreen Khama Billiat couldn’t seal it with the last chance for Chiefs, as the two sides shared the spoils. Perhaps a fair result in the end.
