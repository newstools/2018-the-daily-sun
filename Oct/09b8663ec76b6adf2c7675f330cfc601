PATIENTS from Umlazi V Clinic, south of Durban, are not happy. Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo closed the clinic on Monday following recommendations made in July by the government’s health portfolio committee that found patients’ lives were at risk there. Residents have been urged to use Gateway Clinic or Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital nearby. Nonhlanhla Xulu (28), who used to take her five-month-old baby there to be vaccinated, said the department should have come up with another plan. “Prince Mshiyeni is far, especially for us with babies. It’s hard to travel there on foot with a baby. Now we have no option but to take taxis. It’s an extra expense.” Nombuso Gabela (34) said: “If the department is worried that patients are at risk of getting diseases like TB at the congested clinic, they should have moved those patients who collect their medication to the hospital and not the other patients.” Dhlomo said the small building was 64 years old. “We had no choice when we considered the committee’s reasons.” He said the house-turned healthcare facility used to be a good clinic when the community was small, but that no longer applied.
