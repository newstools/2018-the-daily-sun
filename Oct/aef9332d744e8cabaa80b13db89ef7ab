FOR the first time in Mzansi, sign language will join the list of five new subjects in the 2018 matric exams. Fifty-eight deaf matric pupils from 10 schools will take part in the exams. Basic Education spokesman, Ellijah Mhlanga said the question papers will be signed to the pupils and they will respond by signing too. “The department has piloted its assessment processes in this regard and doesn’t foresee any difficulties with this examination. Another first for the department is the writing of technical mathematics and technical science,” said Mhlanga. He said more than 37 000 grade 12 pupils will sit for the first practical exam in computer application technology on Monday. This will be followed by a practical exam in information technology on Tuesday, which will be written by 4 170 pupils. The exams will then officially begin on 22 October with non-official languages. Basic Education Committee chairwoman Nomalungelo Gina said the committee was made aware of several risks identified by the department. Gina said thus far, there have been no leaks of question papers and the monitoring of exam centres has been strengthened.
