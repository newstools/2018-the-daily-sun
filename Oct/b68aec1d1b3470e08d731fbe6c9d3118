WHEN Thulo Tshehlo started his business 20 years ago, it wasn’t easy. But these days, the 51-year-old from Thaba Nchu in the Free State is a happy man because he loves his work. He told Daily Sun he developed a passion for tanning animal skins and making wooden sculptures when he was just 16 years old. And through hard work and patience, he has managed to make a living. “When I started, it wasn’t easy. I was forced to give up my passion and look for a job. I was raised by a single parent and she used to sell vegetables but it wasn’t enough to support five kids,” he said. “I saved money to buy animal skins to sustain my business and I have never looked back. So far, my business is doing well and in a good month, I make a lot of money. “I sell my stuff in the Bloemfontein CBD and on the busy N8 road. “I use the leather to make mats, keyholders, jackets and drums. He said he never went to school to learn these skills. “God gave me this talent.” Thulo said one of the challenges he faced was that it cost a lot of money to buy animal skins at local farms and nature reserves. “In the future, I want to share my talent with young people by training them. I have a lot of experience in hide tanning and crafting leather products,” he said.
