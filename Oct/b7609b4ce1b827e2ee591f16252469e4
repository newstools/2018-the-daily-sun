COPS have recovered 23 stolen cows in the KZN Midlands! Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the  operation was aimed at cutting back on stock theft in the area. The herd of cattle was recovered last Thursday after airwing members spotted about 600 cows grazing in the mountains. The cattle were not being looked after by herdboys. “They were driven down the mountain by stock theft unit detectives for residents to identify,” Gwala told the People’s Paper. She said the cattle had been possibly routinely taken to the mountains  every morning to graze without being looked after by herdboys. Gwala said the operation was aimed at educating the community about the importance of branding their livestock. “Pamphlets were distributed to residents about branding, the impact of stock theft, and the dangers of buying stolen livestock,” said Gwala. She said similar operations would continue throughout the province. The operation was conducted by the visible policing, airwing, tactical response, stock theft and K9 units. No arrests were made.
