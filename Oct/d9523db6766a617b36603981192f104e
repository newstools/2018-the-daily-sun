THE Forum 4 Service Delivery (F4SD) has called for ward
committees and school governing body members to be trained to fight school
bullying. This was after a video of a teenager from Rustenburg, North
West being bullied went viral on social media. In the video, the pupil was forcefully undressed by fellow
schoolmates. F4SA noted that there are no strategies to fight school
bullying. “South Africa is experiencing a high level of school
drop-outs of which among others, bullying is a huge contributory factor,” F4SD
president Mbahare Kekana said. “Most Members of the School Governing Body are idling and
unemployed so F4SD calls on the government to train them to fight this. “This will curb this intolerable behaviour among the
learners. “F4SD calls for Ward Committees to be taught robust
strategies to dislodge bullying whenever it raises its ugly head.” Kekana also said that F4SD appeals for school governing body
members who are unemployed to be given salaries so that they will be readily
available to fight bullying. “Most members of the school governing body are idling and
unemployed, so F4SD calls on government to train them to fight bullying,” he
said. He also called for schools to be allocated one social worker
who will assist in identifying strange behaviour among pupils.
