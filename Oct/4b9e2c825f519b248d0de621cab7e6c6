IN the wake of HHP’s sudden death that has left the country reeling in shock, renowned actress Florence Masebe has reached out to fan, who tweeted that she lost her father two months ago due to depression. She tweeted: “After my father passed on 2 months ago, I tried to reach out and told people that I have depression. I was told that I'm not the first person to lose a parent, I must stop "IT" and take care of my children.. How do you stop being depressed.” Florence then replied by saying she is available should she need to talk. “Are you ok now? Send me an email if you need to chat,” she said in her tweet. This follows her earlier tweet about how people use religion and call sufferers of depression weak. “Depression is not a joke. It is also not an opportunity for you to practice your religious superman speech. Afford people an opportunity to get the necessary treatment. If they lose the battle, don't call them weak in faith. In fact don't call them weak at all,” the star tweeted.
