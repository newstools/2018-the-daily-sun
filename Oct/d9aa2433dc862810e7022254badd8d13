THEY are golden oldies in the truest sense of the word. For this group of senior citizens, age is nothing more than a number. They are rearing to go for gold at the National Active Aging Activities. Gogos and madalas from all over Mzansi will be proving they are as fit as fiddles and can do whatever others can. The National Active Aging Activities are competitive games for the elderly and they will take place in Bloemfontein, Free State this week, starting today. The senior citizens were in good spirits at the send-off event for the Gauteng Team, held at the Riverside Sun Hotel in Vanderbijlpark in the Vaal, south of Joburg, yesterday. They sang and prayed for a safe journey. To mark the week of the elderly citizens in Mzansi, Gauteng Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula Khoza motivated the provincial team and wished them luck in the national games. A total of 175 senior citizens from different kasis around Gauteng were selected to travel to the Free State to represent the province in the national games. Among other games and activities, they will participate in a choir festival, a parliament of senior citizens and the golden games, which cover over 17 sporting codes. The MEC highlighted the fact that the games helped the elderly keep healthy even in old age. “As government, we are pleased to implement the Active Aging Programme and Golden Games. “These are crucial in efforts to enhance the quality of life and improve the health of older people,” she said. Joseph Kgang (66) from the West Rand, who is running the 4x100 metres relay, said: “By participating in these games we stay healthy, so we can avoid illnesses. “Last year we came in at third position. This year we are aiming for gold!”
