COPS seized Mandrax worth more than R1,5 million in Linton Grange, Port Elizabeth yesterday morning. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu told Daily Sun that at about 5am the Provincial Organised Crime Investigating Unit, Crime Intelligence and members of SAPS Kabega Park swooped on a house in Begonia Street. “About 26 000 Mandrax tablets were found in a suitcase and two sports bags in a flatlet joining the house,” said Naidu. “A 49-year-old man was arrested for dealing in drugs. “The estimated street value of the drugs is R1 560 000.” Naidu said the arrest followed a tip-off and the police responded immediately. The suspect will appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court today. Port Elizabeth police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga applauded the arrest. “Arresting these dealers is important, but we cannot overlook the even greater need to arrest and shut down the manufacturers and suppliers. “The SAPS will continue in our endeavours to cripple the drug trade, which is destroying the lives of innocent young people,” said Ntshinga.
