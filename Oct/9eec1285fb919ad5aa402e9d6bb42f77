POLICE, the CPF, residents and church leaders recently gathered in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, to pray for an end to the social ills that are happening in their kasi. They held the prayer service to the end violence against women and children, as well as other forms of crime. This follows the recent discovery of a woman’s body in one of the kasi streets. Police spokesman Constable Sivenkosi Mtwa said: “The prayer service was also held to help bring calm and stability to the community.” He said police often held similar prayer meetings at the local cop shop, but this time around they felt it was important to involve the community. They were still trying to locate the victim’s family. Earlier this year, children’s bodies were found in Thokoza, and last week others were found in Katlehong. Police were worried that such incidents are on the rise, and Mtwa encouraged residents to report crime. Mtwa asked for the addresses of child-headed households so that police could check on them on a regular basis. He said criminals often took advantage of such households. Police said they will hold more prayer meetings. Mtwa and his colleagues will lead a march soon to celebrate the end of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
