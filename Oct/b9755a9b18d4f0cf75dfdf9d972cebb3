THE EFF in Mpumalanga yesterday opened a case of murder with the Nelspruit police against an mlungu who they say killed his domestic worker, Thandi Zitha (55). The suspect allegedly drove Thandi to the mortuary in his car without informing her family. The suspect allegedly claimed Thandi had collapsed but the family said she had a stab wound on her neck and marks showing she was assaulted. Her daughter, Wendy Zitha (33), said they received a call on 1 October to say her mother had collapsed at work. “We went to town and when we arrived, the suspect took us to a funeral parlour where he had taken her. We asked to see her but the staff told us we couldn’t.” Wendy said the suspect took her to his house and told her to pack her mother’s clothes. “We had unanswered questions and decided to call the EFF to help. We want the suspect to come and answer to what really happened the day my mother died.” Provincial EFF leader Collen Sedibe said the suspect must tell the court why he didn’t call the family to come before he took Thandi to the mortuary. Daily Sun contacted the suspect, who claimed he had followed the right procedure. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed an inquiry into the death has been opened and investigations were underway.
