FOR THREE years the family has been living in misery, terrorised by a creature crawling on their roof. They said it brought them bad luck and never ending sickness. They tried to get help but none of the healers or prophets brought them relief. But now their hope has been reignited. Mum Maggy Mokoena (48) had a vision of Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng of the Incredible Happenings Church, knocking on their door to help them. Maggy, of Danhouse in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, told Daily Sun: “We haven’t had a peaceful night in years. There are also footsteps outside but when we wake up in the morning there are no footprints.” “We are always tired in the morning, as if we’ve been on night shift,” she said. Maggy said she and her five children all had painful knees. She said their food always went missing and her kids were unable to get jobs. “My children all went to school. They are qualified but they can’t get jobs. They keep applying but they have no luck.” Maggy said she had triedto find help but the problem remained. “I was told there’s something buried in the yard. Pastors have confirmed there’s something taking away our luck.” She said she believes Pastor Mboro could help. Mboro said what was happening to the family was pure evil. “They can come to the church. This is not how one should be living,” he said. “The spirit of the Lord is upon me and has anointed me to deliver people from powers of darkness. In Jesus’ name this is not impossible to defeat,” said Mboro.
