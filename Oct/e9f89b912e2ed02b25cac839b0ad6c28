I have suffered vicious attacks to my good name for more than a year and still people are intent on destroying me. These were the words of Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille in a council sitting on Thursday morning. She said: “In so far as the Bowmans investigation and reports are concerned, I said from day one in this chamber that I welcome any investigation. I committed to give my full cooperation and I have done so whenever it was my turn to submit responses. I have also raised my concerns about factual errors in a previous Bowmans report tabled in this Council in January this year. Even so, I kept on cooperating with Bowmans all the time,” De Lille said. This after on Wednesday, there were reports that De Lille might withdraw her resignation as the mayor of Cape Town in order to clear her name – as advised by her lawyers. “I will not break and I will not give into these vehement and racist bullying tactics,” De Lille said. She added that she will soon lay criminal charges against those party members who shared fake news post on social media about her. ACDP Counclillor Grant Haskin asked De Lille, if she was going to hand in her resignation and De Lille made it clear that she wasn’t going to resign. Following that Chaos erupted in council as DA asked for a caucus. Patricia de Lille supporter Shaun August said he can’t stand what’s happening in Cape Town City Council and he resigned as chief whip and DA Councillor. He then walked across the council floor and gave De Lille a big hug and walked out of council chambers with opposition Councillors cheering and applauding. As if that wasn’t enough, four more DA councillors resigned and left the chambers.
