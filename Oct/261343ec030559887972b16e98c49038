National Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) affiliated
workers at the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) have embarked on
strike. Nehawu says the strike is a result of Sassa management not
resolving the problems that the migration of the social grant payment system
from Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) to the South African Post Office (SAPO). Responding to the strike threat by Nehawu, Acting SASSA CEO
Abraham Mahlangu said the agency was disappointed that one of its labour
organisations had threatened to embark on strike action. According to Mahlangu, the affected staff members were
provided with training to enable them to perform the function. “It is also important to clarify that the biometric
enrolment referred to is not a new function. This was previously done manually
as part of the application process, where ink and a pad were used and the
beneficiary’s fingerprint put on paper,” Mahlangu said. Mahlangu said when SASSA entered into a contract with CPS in
2012, the ink, pad and paper were replaced with digital capturing called
biometric enrolment, and SASSA discontinued the manual process, as this would
be a duplicate process. “In its first report to the Constitutional Court in June
2017, SASSA reported that it would take over the biometric enrolment from CPS.
This was later communicated to organised labour, before the staff training commenced,”
Mahlangu explained.
