THE power of the breast to rock your world with pleasure
is often overlooked. There are some lucky men and women who can actually have
an orgasm, without touching their genitals - just by having their nipples
stimulated. Women’s nipples and breasts tend to be more sensitive and
pleasure-provoking then men’s. This is because of the hundreds of nerve
endings, especially in the nipple itself. A study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found
that this is because nipple stimulation in women activates the same region of
the brain as stimulation of the punani. The region in the brain is called the
genital sensory cortex. This means that, for some women, being aroused by
having their nipples touched can lead them to have an orgasm. The sensitivity of women’s nipples also varies according
to their time of the month, with nipples being even more sensitive during
menstruation. Breasts also swell up as much as 25 percent when the
woman is aroused, making them even more sensitive. Remember, we’re all different, so some women like to have
their nipples twisted or bitten while others hate it. So take some time and explore the power and pleasures of
the breast!
