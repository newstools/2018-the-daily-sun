THEY had spent eight years building their relationship before finally taking the plunge and marrying on 7 October this year. Less than a week later on their three-week honeymoon in New York City, the future that Joseph and Francheska Bechara had planned together was in ruins. According to news.com.au, Joseph (28) found Francheska (27) unconscious in a gym in New York City last Saturday. He rushed her to hospital and doctors told him that his new wife had suffered multiple strokes. So far she has had three major brain surgeries to reduce the swelling of her brain. It is expected that Francheska will have to stay in America for at least four months before she will hopefully be well enough to return home. They are only just starting to get to grips with what this means long term for Francheska, and the implications for Joseph too. Is the house they just bought in a suburb in Sydney going to work for them if she’s unable to walk? Will Joseph still be able to work as a project manager at Milestone Civil Australia and care for her, if that’s what’s needed? Will Francheska ever return to her own job as a primary teacher? Fortunately, the couple have a network of incredible friends and family who are working hard to help them. Both Joseph and Francheska’s mums have rushed to New York to be with them. Friends and colleagues have set up a GoFundMe page and they have already raised about half of the estimated $300 000 (about R4,3 million) it will cost to get Francheska the medical care she needs. A charity event and auction are also being planned for later this year to add to the fund. Office manager and friend Sue Richardson, one of the 700 people who attended the couple’s wedding, said: “Their whole life now is who knows, just waiting to see what her recovery is going to be like, it’s just terrible.”
