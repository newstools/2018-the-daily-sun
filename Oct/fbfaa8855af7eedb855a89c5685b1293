A woman’s handbag contains the essentials she needs to deal with the demands of her world But according to studies, it may contain more bacteria than the average toilet! Casey Rousseau of 1st for Women Insurance said: “As women, we hardly go anywhere without our handbags. They’re part of ourselves and keep what we hold dear. “According to various studies, handbags are also the perfect real estate for breeding germs. One study by initial washroom hygiene discovered that the inside of a handbag can hide more kinds of dangerous bacteria than an unflushed toilet.” Handbag cleaning tips - Clean your handbag with anti-bacterial soap – especially leather bags and purses as their spongy texture is the perfect breeding place for bacteria. - Keep your handbag off bathroom counters, kitchen counters, floors, toilet seats, the pavement and other high risk areas. - Keep your bag tightly closed when you are not using it. - Wipe down the items you keep in your bag such as makeup case and cellphone using anti-bacterial wipes. Clean the bottom of the bag and handles as well. - Dip your tube of lipstick in isotropyl alcohol for 15 to 30 seconds, then wipe away the top layer of the lipstick. Leave lipstick and mascara in the freezer overnight to kill surviving bacteria and viruses. - Pour out the contents of your handbag over a spread out newspaper and get rid of the empty hand lotions, old lipsticks, used tissues and worse. Do this often. - Do not carry food in your handbag unless it is in a sealed container or plastic bag. - Check the list of necessities you need in your bag such as notebook, pens, hairclips and other things.
