A PASTOR accused of raping two girls aged 14 and 15 yesterday told the court he would move if he was granted bail but his worshippers would suffer. Abednico Mongo (28) pleaded not guilty to rape and assault charges during his formal bail hearing in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. He told magistrate Tsakani Usinga he wouldn’t interfere with victims or state witnesses. However, Warrant Officer Ekson Maluka told the court he opposed bail as the victims were young and the accused had tried to get people to victimise them on social media. “It’s clear the accused would try to influence the victims. The community is still angry with the pastor, who was arrested at the beginning of the month,” said Maluka. The father of one of the victims told the court his daughter was kidnapped by the pastor in 2016. He said the pastor got her pregnant but the police turned her away when she reported the incident. “We are waiting for the DNA results and this man must be denied bail so our kids can be safe,” said the father. The matter was postponed to today for a final judgment on the bail application.
