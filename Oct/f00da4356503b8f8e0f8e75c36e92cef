A THUG’S attempt to snatch a gold chain from a tourist’s neck ended in his death on Monday afternoon. While being chased through the streets of Cape Town, he jumped to his own death from a bridge at the intersection of Strand and Adderley Streets. According to a witness, the thug, was being chased by security guards and decided to jump about 10 metres from the Strand Street Concourse to the ground. A security guard who works at Golden Acre Mall said: “He fell on his head. I was shocked to see a person come flying down. “The next thing there was just blood all over.” Onlookers crowded around to get a look at the man who died from his injuries minutes later. Long streams of blood flowed from his body which had been covered in a white cloth. Norah Sihlali (34) said: “This guy sentenced himself by jumping to his death. Thugs in the CBD snatch jewellery, phones and handbags and run away. “ I think he deserves what happened because these thugs cause pain for hardworking citizens trying to make a honest living.” Security guard Mihlali Duma (40), who chased the man said: “At first I thought he had outpaced us because we were not ready to jump. I was shocked to see him lying there with blood gushing out of his head. We have a problem with thugs who snatch people’s belongings in town.” Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: “Circumstances surrounding the death of an unknown man in his 20s are being investigated. He fell to his death at the Strand Street Concourse. The necklace he took from a victim was recovered.”
