However, the star’s wife, Lerato Sengadi has taken to social media for the first time since his passing. Sengadi shared a picture of herself with the star on Instagram – allowing fans an opportunity to pass their condolences to her and the family in the comments section. Among those taking the opportunity to send their condolences were fellow stars in the likes of Boity Thulo, Nhlanhla Nciza and Somizi Mhlongo to name a few. Commented Boity: “I’m so sorry, sis. You are in the deepest part of our hearts and prayers. Modimo o teng (God is there) and he will be your source of comfort, strength, healing and peace. You’re not alone.” TV and radio personality Somizi, wrote “I’m even scared to call you because I have no words to make you feel better. None. Because no one can understand what ur feeling right now.” Although Sengadi and HHP were separated at the time of his passing, a close friend told the people’s paper that they were friendly. Said the friend: “There was no bad blood between them - their separation was amicable.” ???? A post shared by  Lerato Sengadi (@leratolicious1) on Oct 24, 2018 at 10:23pm PDT
