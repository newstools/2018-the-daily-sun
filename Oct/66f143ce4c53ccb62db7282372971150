THE family of the 15-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by a pastor was disappointed when he was granted R10 000 bail. After hearing the news, angry residents of Bushbuckridge went on the rampage outside court. They clashed with the pastor’s supporters. Cops had to send a water cannon to disperse the crowd. Speaking to Daily Sun, the girl’s mother said she was not happy with the outcome. She said it broke her heart to know that the man who tried to destroy her child’s life would be back in the comfort of his home. “I can see this evil incident has affected her memory and I’m worried her studies might be affected too,” said the mum. Abednico Mongo (28) pleaded not guilty to two counts of rape and an assault charge. This was during his formal bail hearing in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Tuesday. During yesterday’s appearance, the court heard the accused started raping his victims, aged 14 and 15, in August and September, respectively. The cases were only reported on 3 October and the pastor was then arrested. His lawyer, Vusi Sigodi, told the court the victims needed to be prevented from attending his client’s church until the matter was finalised. But magistrate Tsakani Usinga rejected this and instead ordered the pastor to close down his church. She also ordered the pastor to leave the area and stop preaching in his church at Malubane location. Usinga said he should only come to the area when he was due to appear in court. Busisiwe Manzini, who spoke to Daily Sun on behalf of ANC regional executive committee, said they were disappointed that a man who posed a danger to society had been released. “We are against the abuse of women and children and this so called holy man, who came to destroy our children, must be kept away from our community.” The magistrate postponed the matter until 15 November for the regional prosecutor to decide on when the trial will start.
