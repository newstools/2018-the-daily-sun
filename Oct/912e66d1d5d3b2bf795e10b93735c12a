THE Nkosi family still hasn’t come to terms with the horrific death of their family member. The body of their relative, Sipho Nkosi (43) from Pienaar, Mpumalanga, was found on 16 October at Luphisi, near the border of the Kruger National Park. His right leg, left foot and private parts were missing. Sipho was last seen at home on 9 October when a group of people came to his house and forced him into their car. “He kept asking what he had done, but no one explained,” said family member Patrick Shiba. “He tried to fight back, but they drove off with him in the car.” The family has no idea what the motive was for Sipho’s murder. “Sipho had no enemies,” said another relative, Thandi Simelane. “He was not a violent person and was always happy.” The family said they searched for Sipho with the help of police, but couldn’t find him. After a few days Sipho’s lifeless body was found dumped under a tree. He was covered in blood and his body was also starting to decompose. Thandi said she is worried about his kids. Pienaar police spokeswoman, Captain Jabu Ndubane, said a case of murder and kidnapping has been opened. “The suspects are known and will be arrested soon. We are appealing to the community to come forward with information,” said Ndubane. Sipho was laid to rest yesterday.
