THE family of a cop who was killed in KwaNdengezi, near Pinetown, KZN, on Tuesday is heartbroken. Warrant Officer Zethembe Khwela (54) was shot and killed by unidentified gunmen outside his house. His brother Wiseman Khwela (60) said Zethembe was a dedicated cop who loved his job. “We never thought he would be killed in such a brutal manner,” said Wiseman. He said Zethembe was talking to taxi driver when the incident occurred. “We were surprised to hear gunshots,” said Wiseman. He said the family rushed to Zethembe, who had fallen to the ground. “He died a few minutes later. “I don’t think the killing had anything to do with the taxi business because he wasn’t involved in it. “It looks like this was one of the attacks directed at police officers.” Khwela is survived by his wife, Sergeant Happy Khwela, and their four kids. National police commissioner General John Sitole condemned the murder of Khwela and Captain Wiseman Tyibilika (50), who was murdered on Tuesday in New Brighton, Eastern Cape.
