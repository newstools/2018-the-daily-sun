HE was a humble boy who respected his family and elders. So each time residents wanted to send someone to the shop, they knew that Ntando Khumalo would go without complaining. But on Tuesday, the 14-year-old’s helpful nature led to his death. This after he was shot and killed by unknown gunmen on his way to buy fried chips for a gogo. His uncle, Thamisanqa Khumalo (36), said Ntando left home in L section, KwaMashu, north of Durban in the afternoon to visit a friend. He said later that night, the friend (14) told him that Ntando had been shot while he was waiting for him. “He said Ntando came to his house and asked him to go withhim. The friend said he asked Ntando to wait for him while he went to get a jacket. “While he was in the house, he heard a gunshot. “When he came out, he found Ntando lying on the road. “He said Ntando was still alive and told him that three men came and one of them shot him, but they didn’t take anything,” he said. He said the friend immediately saw a car he knew and asked the driver to rush them to KwaMashu Clinic. “He rushed Ntando to the clinic and left him there while he came to tell us. We rushed to the clinic and were told that he was already in an ambulance being transferred to King Edward VII Hospital. “But when we got to the hospital, we were told he had died,” his uncle said.
