A COMFORTABLE and safe house is something everyone prays for. But Dingiswayo Khoza’s (48) prayer hasn’t been answered. Dingiswayo from Mandeni, north of Stanger, lives in a run down shack. He said the shack he shares with his two daughters, aged eight and 10, isn’t suitable for a person living with a disability. “I had an RDP house, but it collapsed last October during a rainstorm. “Fortunately, my kids were not in the house and I didn’t die. “But I sustained injuries and spent a few weeks in hospital,” he said. Dingiswayo said after the house collapsed, he was forced to move back into his old shack. “I thought I would live in the shack for a short period of time because I reported the incident to the councillor. “But it’s been a year and I’m still here. My fear is that the shack will collapse on me while I’m sleeping. “My daughters are often sick because of the dust in the shack,” he said. He said he didn’t understand why he wasn’t helped. “Sometimes I think I’m being ignored because I’m disabled,” he said. “Every time I go to sleep, I pray for protection. “I often ask God to watch over me and my children.” Councillor Welcome Mthembu said he was aware of the matter and was working on a solution. “I’m not sure when an RDP will be built, but it will be soon,” said Mthethwa.
