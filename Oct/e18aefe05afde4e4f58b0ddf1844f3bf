TRAIN commuters are travelling in fear after eight carriages went up in flames on Tuesday. Commuters believe the fires were the result of an arson attack. Public Transport Voice spokesman Dalton Ndongeni said something needed to be done. “It can’t be business as usual. This incident exposed the lack of security at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s stations,” said Ndongeni. Ndongeni said he suspected a syndicate was stealing cables and vandalising Prasa’s stations. “Not any Jack and Jill can dig up cables. “It must be someone who knows where the cables are. “Now the problem has escalated from cable theft to arson attacks,” he said. Commuter Mandisi Mafukuzela (40) said: “I gave up on trains because they’re useless. Only one train travels to Khayelitsha every 90 minutes. I grew tired of arriving at work late.” Acting Prasa CEO Siyabonga Sithole said Cape Town’s central line would only be fully functional in December next year. Western Cape SACP secretary Benson Ngqetsu said the rail agency didn’t have a plan to deal with the crisis. He said: “The report they presented to parliament had no punch. It was neither inspiring nor aggressive.”
