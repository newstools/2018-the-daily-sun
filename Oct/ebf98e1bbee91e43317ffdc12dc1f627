WORRIED parents who live in villages in the Mbhashe and Mnquma municipalities want government to speed up services so their kids will be safe at school. Parents raised their concerns at a provincial legislature meeting in Mqhele Village, Elloitdale on Tuesday. The meeting was part of the Eastern Cape government’s programme of taking the legislature to the people. Parent Abraham Sivile called on the eduction department to hire more permanent teachers. “We also ask for transparency from our government. Most schools in the villages don’t have fences or toilets.” Another parent, Mntuwekhaya Ndamase, said: “Hostels must be built, especially for grade 12 pupils. “Most pupils rent flats and it’s not safe for them. We also want the police to patrol around the schools regularly to root our substance abuse.” Residents said they wanted government to build tarred roads in the villages. They told government leaders they were tired of waiting so long for services. Parent Nomfundo Ntlabathi said: “Teachers battle to get to school when it’s raining because the roads in our village are bad. “Government should also build bridges because our kids are forced to cross rivers to get to school.” Acting education MEC Mlungisi Mvoko said: “The department is looking at draining toilets at schools that are in need of that. We can’t build schools quickly, but we will help where we can.” Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana said her department was working on fixing the roads. “The legislature came here while we are busy with that. We will fix all the roads in Elloitdale. “Some of the roads fall under the municipalities, but our priority is to fix them. “We commit that clinics and schools are our top priority and this will all be done in three years’ time.”
