A LECTURER at the University of Limpopo was suspended yesterday following allegations that he  demanded sex from female students. The “poke for a pass” lecturer has allegedly been harassing girls since he arrived at the campus six years ago. The students who refused to sleep with him are wondering whether they will pass. Final year students at the university told Daily Sun the lecturer gave them poor marks because they refused to sleep with him. The students spoke to the People’s Papers on condition that they would remain anonymous because they feared being victimised. One of them said previous students had warned them to stay away from the lecturer. She said they told them he would want to sleep with them. She said the lecturer asked for their contact numbers last year, claiming it would make it easier for them to communicate. “At first I thought the previous students were lying to us until I become one of his victims,” said one woman. “I was shocked when he called, telling me he wanted to see me privately and that I could be his wife one day,” she said. She said the lecturer’s calls began to stress her out and her academic performance dropped. Another student said she was forced to change her research topic and module because the lecturer made moves on her every day. University of Limpopo spokesman Johannes Selepe said the lecturer was suspended. He said allegations of sexual harassment levelled against him were being investigated.
