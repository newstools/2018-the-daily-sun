CALM has been restored after the protest action by expanded public works programme workers left the Durban CBD dirty. They returned to work on Friday while protest leaders continued their meetings with eThekwini officials. The workers downed tools on Monday and shut down eight depots around Durban while they protested outside the Springfield, Durban solid waste office. Protest organiser Sifiso Mdletshe told Daily Sun they wanted the municipality to hire workers permanently. “We told our colleagues to go back to work but if the municipality fails to listen to us, we will go back to the streets.” He said the municipality hired 150 workers in January, while the 700 left out were allegedly promised they would be hired in July. “We want them to keep their promise. “We know they can do it,” Mdletshe said. Mayoral spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said the programme employs workers on a temporary basis only to help people. “It’s not permanent and no policy says it must be so.”
