He said if it wasn’t for the People’s Paper, it would have been difficult to find him. The snake inyanga, whose real name is Musa Zulu, was accused of killing a neighbour. He first accused neighbour Connie Khosa (30) of making his wife sick. He claimed Connie was involved in evil things and that, if his wife died, he would kill Connie. In less than a week, his wife died and Musa shot Connie dead. He also allegedly chased Connie’s husband, who ran out of the house and went go to the police station. Gogo Maria Khoza (75) welcomed the sentence.
