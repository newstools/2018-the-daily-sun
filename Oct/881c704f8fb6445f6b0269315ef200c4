AFTER a man’s body was found, angry residents of Tswinga Village outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo went on the rampage. The body of Ndamulelo Nekhalale (26) was found by his family on Tuesday afternoon in the bush not far from a local tavern. He went missing in the early hours of Sunday morning. His younger brother Khwathelani Nekhalale said the family was worried when he didn’t return home after going to the tavern on Saturday night. “We reported him missing. We looked for him everywhere with the police but had no luck. “We received a call from one of his neighbours who told us my brother had chased after a thief the previous night. He also told us the direction the man ran in. “We went in that direction until we found his body in the bush not far from the tavern,” said Khwathelani. He said the family could not believe it was him. “We’re very sad but we are not pointing fingers as we have faith in the police. We believe their investigations will reveal what actually happened before our brother was killed.” After the body was taken away, a group of residents went to the main road, where they blocked the road with burning tyres. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said they had opened a murder docket and investigations were underway.
