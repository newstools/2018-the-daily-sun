THE Department of Basic Education says the letter circulating that a Mathematics paper was leaked is fake. According to the department the letter has its logo, but it has no address, contact details or the name of the author. “We view this misleading communication in a very serious light, as it has the real potential of causing confusion and anxiety among our Grade 12 learners presently writing their examinations,” the department said on Monday. The department has urged Mzansi to ignore the fake letter. “We call upon our learners and teachers alike to continue to demonstrate commitment and good conduct as the examinations continue.” “Examinations are proceeding well across the country and no question paper has been leaked nor has there been a circular issued regarding any re-writing of any papers,” the department says. The department said all nine provinces are monitoring the examinations on a constant basis to ensure that all goes well
