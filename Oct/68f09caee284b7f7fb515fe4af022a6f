IF you’re new to Mangaung’s Khayelitsha kasi, you’d be forgiven for thinking many people living here work on farms and in gardens. Everywhere, men and women are seen carrying garden forks and pangas. But you’d be mistaken. They’re all carrying whatever weapon they have to defend themselves against tsotsis that rule their streets. Residents said thugs robbed them of their ARVs, money and cellphones and that police were failing them. They said when they reported matters to cops they were told there was a shortage of cars, even though the police are often seen using the state cars for personal errands. Mathabo Lejapudi (28), whose friend was robbed of ARVs and a cellphone on Saturday at about 7pm, said: “We are forced to remain locked in our homes from early in the evening because thugs rule our kasi. “On weekends we don’t carry handbags with make-up but knives, garden forks and pangas. “Police don’t help us. They only come when someone is dead,” said Lejapudi. Mluleki Thys (45) added: “I was on my way to hang out with friends at the local tavern on Saturday when a group of thugs robbed me of R800 and my cellphone. Now whenever I go out I take a screwdriver for self-defence. I didn’t bother to open a case because it’s a waste of time,” he said. “Police should patrol the area day and night.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Fikiswa Matoti encouraged residents to join local community policing forums. Complaints should be directed to the Bloemspruit police commander, she said. The cop shop’s new numbers are 051 411 2800 or 051 411 2801/2.
