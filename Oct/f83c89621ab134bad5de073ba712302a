THE search for the two bodies spotted by residents in the fast-flowing Apies River in Tshwane has been called off. Daily Sun published the story last Tuesday of the search for the bodies that started last Sunday morning after the rain stopped. According to two witnesses, husband and wife Petros du Plessis and Ramona Erasmus, they saw the bodies of a woman and a man floating down the river last Saturday at about 6pm. Petros told Daily Sun they were at the river to watch the water after the storm. They said while they were looking at the flowing water, they first saw the body of a man wearing blue overalls being washed away. “A few minutes later the body of a woman wearing a pink top floated by.” Petros said the incident took place between Capital Park and Hercules. He told Daily Sun the water was coming down in full force and he and his wife managed to stop a car that wanted to cross the Apies River Bridge as the water was flowing over the bridge. Tshwane Emergency Services spokesman Johan Pieterse said they weren’t part of the search anymore as it was being handled by the police diving unit. Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the search was called off last week after no bodies were found. “No case of a missing person was reported either,” Dlamini said.
