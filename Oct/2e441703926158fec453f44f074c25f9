TAXI commuters yesterday found themselves in the crossfire of a taxi war. At least several people were injured and taken to hospital after a shoot-out, apparently between two taxi associations fighting over routes. Commuters said they were bullied into using one taxi association over another. It’s understood the incident was part of an ongoing dispute between the Vaal Wits and Orange Farm United taxi associations in Gauteng. Residents of Savanna City in the Vaal said they had been using the Orange Farm United association for years until Vaal Wits came onto the scene in July. They said they were taken out of Orange Farm United taxis at gunpoint. Many commuters were scared to speak to the SunTeam, but Willie Phadziri (61) said he was gatvol and was not afraid. “They are very violent and not considerate of their customers,” said Willie. “At times we wait for almost an hour for a taxi and it drops us far from the usual stops.” Another resident said: “I’ve received a written warning for getting to work late.” Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said four people believed to be taxi association members were in hospital after being shot. “Passengers who were in a taxi were also injured,” he told Daily Sun. “Police are investigating the shooting, but no arrests have been made.” Attempts to get hold of the associations were unsuccessful.
