GOSPEL singer Katlego Ralikhuvhana (28) has opened up about her hijacking and kidnapping ordeal. She said she would be dead if it hadn’t been for prayer. She said seven heavily armed men hijacked and kidnapped her in front of her home in Midrand, Joburg, three months ago. She told Daily Sun: “I was staring death in the face but God saved my life. “The ordeal, which took almost two hours, was the worst time of my life.” Kay Rali, as she is known, said she had come from the shops that night in June. The mother of two said she was driving her white Jeep while the thugs drove a grey one. “Two men who covered their faces jumped into my car and ordered me into their Jeep.” She said security guards at her complex called cops, and before she knew it, bullets were flying as the thugs and cops shot at each other. Kay Rali said one of the thugs looked at her as if he wanted to finish her off, and she prayed. “God is alive. He saved my life. I managed to open the door and fell out while the police continued chasing and shooting at the thugs,” she said. She said it was her first time experiencing such violence. “I thought the thugs would gang-rape and kill me. “I kept on screaming, but those men were just evil,” she said. While praying, she said, she promised God she would preach the gospel through music if he saved her life. After the incident, she started writing songs, some of them a testimony to her experience. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini confirmed to the People’s Paper that a case of hijacking was opened. Dlamini said police were investigating.
