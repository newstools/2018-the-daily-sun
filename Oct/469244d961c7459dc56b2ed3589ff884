EVIL thugs sneaked into a gogo’s house in the early hours of Saturday morning and raped her. The 62-year-old from Overbaakens in Port Elizabeth said she heard her dog barking, but before she could figure out was happening, two men with knives stormed into her house. Police spokeswoman Colonel Michelle Matroos told Daily Sun the gogo immediately called her neighbour when she heard the dog barking at about 3am. “While the victim was still on the phone, the suspects kicked her kitchen door open. “She managed to lock herself in the garage, but the suspects forced it open and dragged her back into the house. “The men took an undisclosed amount of money from her handbag and one of them allegedly raped her in the bathroom.” Matroos said the men fled when they realised the police had arrived. “A cellphone and DVD player were also stolen and the victim was taken to the hospital for treatment. “Police are investigating cases of robbery and rape,” she said.
