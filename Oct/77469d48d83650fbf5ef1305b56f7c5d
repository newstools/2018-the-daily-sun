THEY need help to find their missing loved ones. Two families from Thabong near Welkom, Free State reported their relatives missing more than a month ago. Nontsikelelo Ramarokolo (16) from Uxolo Street in Thabong was last seen going to school on 7 September, but she never came home. According to Captain Malebo Khosana, the young girl’s mum realised something was wrong when Nontsikelelo didn’t return. “The mum reported her missing at Thabong cop shop,” said Khosana. He said they heard from Nontsikelelo’s mum that she was a pupil at Riebeeckstad High School. “She was wearing her school uniform on the day she went missing,” said Khosana. In another incident, Foko Letooane’s family needs SunReaders’ help to find him. The 27-year-old went missing on 9 September. “After several searches by his brothers and sister-in-law, Foko was reported missing at Thabong Police Station,” said Khosana. Foko, who lived with his relatives, is originally from Lesotho. But his family in Lesotho said they haven’t seen him.
