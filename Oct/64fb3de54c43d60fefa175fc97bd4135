Singer Zahara is clearly a fan of Idols contestants Yanga Sobetwa. The 16 year old, who is the youngest contestant in this year’s competition is proving to be one of the favourites with only a few weeks to go. Her riveting performance of Xa Bendingena Mama originally by Zahara, like whom many believe she looks, left the State Theatre Buzzing. The youngster’s performance was not only hugely appreciated by the fans and judges but by Zahara herself. The Loliwe hitmaker took to social media to send a special message to Yanga for doing justice to her song. In a video Zahara posted on Twitter she said: “Hey Yanga, my sisters just called me right now, they like you are my younger sister and I’m their old sister…I just want to say keep up the good work.” Another established star, Amanda Black also showed some love to Yanga after her performance. “I’m not gonna lie guys!! I couldn’t breathe!!! Yanga,” Amanda Black Tweeted.
