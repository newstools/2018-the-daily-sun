THE two
police officers who allegedly killed Tshwane University of Technology
(TUT), student Katlego Monareng
have been granted bail. They are
expected to appear at the Soshanguve Court again on 25 January 2019. Monareng was killed in August during a protest over the
Student Representative Council elections. At that time, the police alleged that they fired warning
shots into the crowd with R5 rifles. They also alleged that nobody was injured, and that police
cars were damaged. In a statement, on Monday the Independent Police
Investigative Directorate (IPID) said they concluded its investigation and only
two technical reports were outstanding.
