POLOKWANE City FC head coach Jozef Vukusic is pleased with his team’s good form so far this season. But the Slovakian mentor believes there is still room for improvement. City beat Maritzburg United 1-0 in an Absa Premiership encounter at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. Rise and Shine have now gone seven league matches without defeat, registering five wins and two draws. The last time City lost a league match was two months ago to defending Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns. “We play to our full potential, taking it one game at a time,” said Vukusic, who is in his debut season in the top flight. “But we are not there yet. We will get better as the season progresses. We also need to work on our final passes.” City currently have 17 points from nine league games. They are only three points behind current leaders Bidvest Wits and have a game in hand. Vukusic added that they aim to collect as many points as they can before the league goes on Christmas break. “We want to go into the December break comfortable on points,” he said. “We need to continue with this form and collect points.” On their win against United, Vukusic said: “It’s easy to play teams like Kaizer Chiefs because you have nothing to lose. But a team like Maritzburg United is tough to beat. It was a tough game but I think we deserve the win. “We were not that good in the first half but in the second half we played better.” Edgar Manaka scored the only goal of the match to help City bag three points. They host Soweto giants Orlando Pirates in their next league match at Peter Mokaba Stadium on 6 November.
