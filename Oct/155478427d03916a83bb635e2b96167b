Singer and Idols SA runner up, Mthokozisi Ndaba and his fiancé, actress, Nandipha Sefoloko have welcomed a baby boy. The proud parents made the announcement on social media last night. “To God be the glory for the prince is finally born. On his behalf, I give his life to you oh might God, guide and protect him always,” they said. The couple has been together for quite some time now and their relationship has survived trying times like when a young woman accused Mthokozisi of assault. 21-year-old, Neo Tsele accused the singer of assaulting her in a Braamfontein flat in 2017 but the case was later dropped due to unclear reasons.
