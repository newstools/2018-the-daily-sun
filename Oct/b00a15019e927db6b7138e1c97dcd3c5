THREE months ago, security guards were overjoyed when they were insourced and received letters of appointment. This came after Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba announced that 4 000 guards would be permanently employed by the city. However, Daily Sun has learned that hundreds of the guards were called to a meeting on Friday and told they were being dismissed. Jabu Mashaba, who has worked as a guard for six years, said: “About 300 of us were told our contracts had been terminated. No further explanation was given.” The guards said they were told to sign termination letters to get their salaries but 30 of them refused. Early this year, Mashaba said the city would insource its guards as the municipality was paying about R14 000 for each guard but the guards were only getting a salary of R4 500 a month. They were made municipal employees and given benefits like medical aid, pensions and housing. “The city set certain criteria for all applicants to qualify for insourcing. Some applicants failed to meet the criteria and consequently their employment as security officers is in the process of being terminated,” read a statement.
