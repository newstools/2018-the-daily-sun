HE’s just a normal guy who also grew up in Mzansi’s rural heaven of the Eastern Cape. But when he saw the devastating effects of crime and drug abuse in his beloved village, Mzekelo Thiwani decided to do something about it. The 35-year-old from Vonqo Village, Dutywa organised a local sports tournament and it was held last weekend. It included soccer, netball and horse racing. Mzekelo told Daily Sun that he was sad to see youths doing drugs and crime. “I was born and grew up in this village. Our brothers and sisters before us behaved very well and it was rare to see them in the taverns drinking booze. “But today’s young people are doing crime and using drugs. So I’ve been thinking what I can do to keep them away from crime and drugs and after getting Chief Dal’uvuyo Sihlanu’s blessing, I organised this tournament. The department of sport and recreation and Mbhashe Municipality gave me trophies and medals and helped with sponsorships. “I’ve run out of words to thank them.” He added that they hoped to present the tournament annually. Chief Dal’vuyo Sihlanu said he was elated to see a young person taking on such a good initiative. Qeqe FC walked away with the soccer bragging rights, while Jadezweni Netball Club claimed first place after beating Peace Makers. Zonisele Sosikela won the horse race.
