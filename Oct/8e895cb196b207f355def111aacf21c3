KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo is putting much effort into improving women’s health. Accompanied by traditional healers, the MEC visited the Umzinyathi area in central KZN this week. Dhlomo said his department is targeting women and teenage girls to educate them about the benefits of abstaining from sex and the advantages of family planning. “It is believed that 8% of pregnancies come from teenage mothers but these mums contribute 25% to the rate of maternal deaths. “When people who are aged 13, 14 and 15 fall pregnant it tends to have a lot of other consequences,” said Dhlomo. The MEC also encouraged pregnant women to seek antenatal care early. “The first visit to a clinic during the second or third month is important. This is when the foetus starts to develop and it may be vulnerable to underlying diseases if no health examinations are made.” Dhlomo led a march in the Dundee CBD. He urged young people to abstain from sex and to use dual protection. He appealed to men to undergo medical male circumcision to lower their risk of getting HIV/Aids. Traditional healers generally agreed that muthi mustn’t be used during pregnancy.
