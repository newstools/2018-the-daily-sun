COSATU in KZN is acting against fuel price and Value Added Tax hikes. On Friday, members of the trade union brought Durban to a standstill as they picketed at the Mariannhill toll plaza. The picket saw drivers on the N2 and N3 freeways stuck for several hours as marchers moved at a snail’s pace. Daily Sun spoke to KwaDukuza Cosatu chairman Buhle Khuzwayo, who said the aim of the march was to show their anger at the increased fuel prices and VAT, which is now at 15%. “The two are hitting the pockets of the poor hard. It is not our mistake that we find ourselves having to pay 1% more on VAT,” said Khuzwayo. He said they were calling on the government to consider that ordinary citizens did not have to pay for the sins they didn’t commit. “We’re here today because somebody somewhere failed to carry out the budget as expected. We are saying that cross shouldn’t be pinned on ordinary citizens,” said Khuzwayo. He said the government should correct its mistake and make sure that the people responsible for the problem were held accountable. While some supported the cause by hooting, others were angry that they had to spend so much time on the road. Percival Mzobe from KwaDukuza said while he was fully behind the call, he thought the timing of the picket was not right. “It only takes an hour to reach Durban from KwaDukuza. But I have been sitting here for about three hours and I am not even half-way there,” he said.
