RESIDENTS of KwaMashu C section, north of Durban, have demanded that a tavern in their area shut its doors for good. This follows a stabbing incident on Sunday at Mgababa tavern in which two men died. Residents said many lives had been lost in the past because of fights that started at the tavern. Now angry residents want the drinking hole closed to prevent more deaths. In the latest incident, a man stabbed two patrons to death and left several others injured. When the SunTeam arrived at the scene on Monday afternoon, workers were still washing bloodstains off the floor. A resident told Daily Sun the attacker, who is from the area, tried to force himself on a woman. “The woman refused to go with the man, so he tried to force himself on her. “People who knew him tried to stop him. All hell broke loose. He stabbed two men to death and attacked other patrons.” She said people screamed and ran in different directions as the attacker hopped from table to table, attacking anyone who tried to stop him. He managed to flee. “He really seemed possessed,” said the resident, who was present when the stabbing took place. KZN police spokesman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “Two men died after they were stabbed, allegedly by a known suspect who fled after the incident. “The motive for the attack is unknown at this stage. “KwaMashu police are investigating two counts of murder.”
