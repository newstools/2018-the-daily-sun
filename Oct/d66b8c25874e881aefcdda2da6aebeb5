THE family of a man whose body was found in a wheelbarrow in the open veld want his killers to be arrested. It would appear that Msawenkosi Khumalo (35) had a reputation of sorts. Msawenkosi, from Tshelimnyama, west of Durban, was found dead on 5 October. His body had multiple stab wounds. His sister Mpume Shozi (37) told Daily Sun Msawenkosi didn’t deserve to die in such a brutal manner. “We were told a tuck shop owner and his friends caught him trying to break in,” she said. They apparently beat him to a pulp. Speaking to the People’s Paper, Mpume urged police to arrest the suspects. “Witnesses told us everything, but before they could tell the police what they had seen the suspects threatened them,” said Mpume. She said the witnesses had vanished shortly after the threats. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that Msawenkosi’s body was found in a wheelbarrow in the open veld. Gwala said the case was still under investigation.
