THE Victoria Hospital in Alice, Eastern Cape recently celebrated 100 years. The hospital is one of the oldest in the country. It serves more than 100 000 people from surrounding villages and towns. The hospital prides itself on training the first black nurse, Cecilia Makiwane, in 1908. It went on to train scores of other nurses. During the celebration, Eastern Cape Health MEC Helen Sauls-August called for the hospital to be renamed. “This hospital must be renamed after one of the legends or heroes who played a big role in this country,” said the MEC. “Can you please change the name as we go into the next centenary of the hospital? I put this to the people of this area and to Sport and Arts MEC Bulelwa Tunyiswa to decide.” Tunyiswa said: “We have a committee that deals with names that need to be changed. “We wish the hospital could be named after mama Albertina Sisulu. There are some relevant things between mama Sisulu and Victoria Hospital. She was a nurse and we also celebrated her centenary this year,” said Tunyiswa. “But it’s the responsibility of residents to decide on the name that they want. Public participation is very important, especially when it comes to things like this.” Resident Siyabulela Xekethwane (43) told Daily Sun there was no need to change the hospital’s name. “This hospital is part of history in this area. Our town is also known in other areas because of this hospital. I don’t support MEC Sauls- August’s call to change the hospital’s name.” Another resident, Bulelwa Nodada (36), said she agreed with Sauls-August’s call for the name to be changed. “This hospital must be named after our heroes.”
