WHEN a bitter man couldn’t accept being dumped by his girlfriend, he allegedly went to her parent’s home and burned it down! Two children and their madala, Ben Kekana (70), died in the horrific incident at 3am on Friday in Sekgakgapeng Village, outside Mokopane. The fire left five other family members seriously injured. The suspect was taken to Mahwelereng Police Station in Limpopo two days before, after violating two protection orders his girlfriend Kedibone Kekana (27) had issued against him. The two dead children were both Kedibone’s. Kedibone’s mum, Francina (53), said the family blamed the police for the tragedy as the suspect threw a petrol bomb at their home just hours after being released. “When he realised Kedibone didn’t love him any more, he started threatening her and demanding she give him their two-month-old baby,” Francina said. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba said three counts of murder and arson were opened for further investigation. “The suspect is still at large. We are requesting that Bongani Boshomane (45) report to the nearest police station to assist with our investigation,” said Ledwaba. He pleaded with anyone with information about the incident to contact Captain Richard Boshomane at 079 894 5501.
