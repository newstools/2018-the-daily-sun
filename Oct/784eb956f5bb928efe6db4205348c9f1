IT WAS a painful moment when the coffins of three relatives were placed in front of mourners. Hundreds of people came to pay their last respects to Zalisile (44), Fezile (38) and Novangeli Nomqonde (36) in Mafini, Libode, on Saturday. The three were shot dead on 4 October during a robbery at a spaza shop. According to a witness, two armed men entered the spaza and demanded cash and cellphones. One of the victims refused to give them the cellphones because they didn’t belong to her. The suspects opened fire, killing two of the family members instantly. The third victim died in hospital. Family spokesman Vuyisa Nomqonde said they were still struggling to come to terms with the tragedy. He said what made things worse was the fact that police seemed to be dragging their feet. “We’re not happy because no arrests have been made. “We can only hope that justice will be served,” he said. Ward councillor Xolisile Dlani said the incident had shocked the whole community. He said he would meet with the local station commander today so he could discuss the case with him. Police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said cops would follow any possible leads. “We appeal to anyone with information that could lead to an arrest to come forward,” Koena told the People’s Paper.
