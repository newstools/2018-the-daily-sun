THE Curnick Ndlovu highway is the site of many deadly crashes. On Saturday, four people died after the driver of a heavy water tanker truck lost control on the  highway in Inanda, north of Durban. Netcare 911  spokesman Shawn Herbst said paramedics responded to reports of a serious collision just after 9pm. He said reports from the scene indicated the driver of the truck lost control of the vehicle  and crashed. “The adult occupants of the truck, two males and two females, were trapped in the  wreckage,” said Herbst. “  The fire and rescue services had to use the Jaws of Life to free them.” He said the victims were assessed by advanced life s upport paramedics and were declared dead at the scene. KZN cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed  the accident. “Four people died at the scene. A case of culpable homi  cide is being investigated by Inanda police,” said Gwala. She said two men, aged 30 and 33, and two women, aged 25 and 30, would only be identified once their families  had been informed. A resident who lives near the highway told Daily Sun: “Unfortunately, this accident happened late at night while most people were in their homes. “No one actually saw what disturbed the driver of the truck that he en ded up losing control. “I was in my house when I heard the loud noise of the truck crashing.” He said a  few years ago several churches gathered to cast away the evil spirits they believed were behind the bloodshed.
