Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter has called up Cape Town City defender Thamsanqa Mkhize and Orlando Piratesâ€™ Thembinkosi Lorch to replace the injured Thapelo Morena and Vincent Pule. Both Morena and Pule were released from the Bafana Bafana camp on Monday evening after being checked by the team medical team. They two received knocks during the weekend games and coach Baxter was hopeful that they would shake off the niggling injuries. But having checked them for most of Monday, Bafana Bafana team doctor Dr Thulani Ngwenya decided to release the two. Bafana Bafana play Seychelles on Saturday at FNB Stadium in an AFCON qualifier (3pm). South Africa leave for the return game in Seychelles on Sunday and play the islanders on Tuesday, 16 October before returning home the following day.
