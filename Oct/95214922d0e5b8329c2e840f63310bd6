HUNDREDS of mourners attended the funeral of Matsatsi Maleka at Kanana extension 10 in Hammanskraal, Tshwane yesterday. The 29-year-old was brutally killed by her boyfriend and a friend of his three weeks ago. The People’s Paper published the story yesterday of how Matsatsi was chopped up for R50 000. She had been missing for 10 days, and when the family asked the boyfriend where she was, he said he did not know. But the residents suspected that he had something to do with Matsatsi’s disappearance, and they beat him until he allegedly confessed where she was. Her body was found with her punani, breasts and tongue missing. Speakers at the funeral described Matsatsi as being a friendly person. Bontle Mmapula said she had lost a sister as well as a friend: “She was friendly and she was always there for me.” Community leader Ida Mashamaite said women in Kanana should stand up and fight. “We have been silent for too long. Let us make sure what happened to Matsatsi will not happen again. “What are we doing to stop this? Let us do something,” she said.
