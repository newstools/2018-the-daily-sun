A MIRACLE saw a truck driver and his assistant survive a crash. But for residents of Sibangweni Village outside Mthatha, it was divine intervention of another kind. When driver Phakamile Mceleni lost control of the truck after falling asleep at the wheel on Saturday morning, the truck’s load of Chibuku beer was spilled! Locals rushed to the scene as soon as they heard the news that there was free beer for everyone. The accident happened just after 5am on the N2 freeway between Mthatha and Tsolo. Mceleni said they left Durban for Mthatha on Friday at 7pm. He said he fell asleep and the truck swerved off the road and he lost control. “I tried to turn it back onto the road but it swerved and overturned.” He said he was glad he and his colleague were still alive. He escaped the accident unharmed and his assistant was taken to hospital for minor injuries. Langa Mathiso said he was so pleased to get free booze for the weekend. “I’m not celebrating the accident but now we have free booze. It’s very hot today and it’s the weekend – I’ll enjoy the Chibuku with my friends.” The road was re-opened four hours after the accident.
