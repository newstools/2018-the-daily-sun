ORLANDO Pirates warmed up for the Soweto derby against Kaizer Chiefs with a hard fought 1-0 victory over Chippa United at Orlando Stadium last night. The Buccaneers booked their place into the Telkom Knockout quarterfinal at the expense of the Chilli Boys. Vincent Pule’s tap in 16 minutes into the second half, turned out to be the winner. Bucs were full value for their win in this last 16 round as they dominated the match from start to finish. They now go into the sold-out Soweto derby against their bitter rivals Chiefs, at the FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon high on confidence. Bucs have now beaten the Chilli Boys by the same score line in two matches without conceding home and away this season. Eric Tinkler made his first visit as the Chilli Boys coach against his former club in Soweto, but his visit was ruined by Bucs sublime performance. After the two weeks of a Fifa international break, the two teams were eager to get back in action. Bucs showed more hunger to progress to the next round. Bucs were full of running as usual and asked a couple of questions while their Eastern Cape based outfit struggled in the first half. Tinkler substituted his skipper Mark Mayambela four minutes before the break with former Bucs star Daine Klate. Mayambela appeared not to be happy with the decision as he didn’t shake hands with his coach and headed straight into the dressing room. It took an hour of football for Bucs to break the deadlock. Pule tapped in Xola Mlambo’s inviting cross to deservedly put the home side in the driving seat. The Chilli Boys had no choice but to push forward in an attempt to force the game into extra-time, but they couldn’t do it as Bucs name made it to the quarterfinal draw. ¦   Yesterday’s other results : Free State Stars 0 – 1 Bidvest Wits; Maritzburg United 2 – 1 Highlands Park; Mamelodi Sundowns 1 – 0 Bloemfontein Celtic; Baroka FC 2 – 0 Golden Arrows.
