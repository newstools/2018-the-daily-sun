BETTY  Mathikge (46) has applied for an ID book four times, and four times it has come back with the wrong surname! Betty’s four IDs identify her as Mathekga, but  her real surname is Mathikge. She first applied between 1998 and 2000 in Rustenburg. And the last attempt at correcting the error was in January when she applied for a smart ID card. The smart card bears the correct signature, but the printed surname  remains wrong. Betty, a mother of four, said   she was was worried that her children would suffer. “  My children don’t have birth certificates because of this,” she said. “Their clinic cards have Mathikge and my ID has Mathekga. “I’ve tried everything to fix this and I’m running out  of ideas. “I want to be able to produce my ID without having to explain the  problem.” Her son   Ofentse (25) said his mum’s troubles had made life hard for him. He said he struggled to finish school because of the different surnames. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said: “I’ve referred the matter to the relevant department. “They’ll contact her to help  her.”
