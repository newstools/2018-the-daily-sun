Since the year started, Barberton Prison officials have been experiencing livestock theft – but now the culprit has been bust. Mpumalanga Correctional Services communications manager Messiah Hlungwani said since last year, cattle, vegetables and pigs had been stolen and it was worrying the department. He said last month, seven pigs were stolen. “This made the department launch an investigation, which led to a resident’s arrest.” On 24 September, the accused (44) was caught red-handed with pork bearing the department’s marks. The meat was immediately confiscated, while the suspect was bust and charged with livestock theft and possession of stolen property. He appeared in Barberton Magistrates Court on 26 September. Hlungwani said the meat was sent to the laboratory for forensic investigation. “The department will treat this as an act of crime and we’ll do anything to ensure suspects are brought to book. We warn residents that livestock theft will not be tolerated.” Residents said the unavailability of employment and poverty is the cause of the theft being experienced by the department.
