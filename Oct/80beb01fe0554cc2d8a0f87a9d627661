A POLICE constable who allegedly attended to a complaint while drunk last Sunday is in hot water. Residents made a video of him and Mountain Rise cop shop in Pietermaritzburg is now investigating. In a video posted to the Police Pics and Clips Facebook page, complainants can be heard asking if he’s drunk. He replies and asks why they’re shouting, and residents can be heard saying he couldn’t even stand up. Police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker confirmed to Daily Sun the cop was under investigation. “According to the station commander of Mountain Rise cop shop, the constable responded to a complaint on Copesville Drive, but the complainants realised he was highly intoxicated,” he said. Naicker said the matter was immediately brought to the attention of the cop’s commander, who booked him off duty and reported him to the station commander. He said a constable who was driving him on the day of the incident would also be investigated. “Although the other constable was sober, the fact that he failed to act against his colleague is viewed as serious misconduct,” said Naicker. The constable in the video was now deskbound and his gun taken away.
