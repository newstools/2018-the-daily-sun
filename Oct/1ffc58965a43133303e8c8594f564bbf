Excitement has been building around the country as Kwaito legend Zola will be making his much anticipated return to the small screens tonight. Zola, real name Bonginkosi Dlamini, had a popular outreach TV show, Zola 7, which was canned in 2010 after its eighth season. Seven years later, the 41 year-old is back presenting a new show called Hope With Zola on Moja Love, which has a similar concept to his old show on SABC 1. This has left many of the star’s fans buzzing with excitement as their calls for Zola to return to TV were finally heard. READ: ZOLA BACK WITH NEW TV SHOW!
