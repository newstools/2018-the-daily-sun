WHEN cops stopped Vulindlela Shezi’s brother Simphiwe and asked for his driver’s licence, all hell broke loose. Today, Vulindlela (20) from Umzinyathi, KZN, is in hospital with a bullet wound to the leg. The trouble started on Saturday while he, his mum and Simphiwe were travelling in Simphiwe’s VW Polo in Inanda. When police asked Simphiwe to show them his licence, Vulindlela tried to explain he had lost it in August. The situation got out of control when one of the cops allegedly hit Vulindlela and told him to shut his mouth. Vulindlela responded by hitting the cop, who allegedly pulled out his gun and shot him. Vulindlela’s mum Nosipho said: “Vulindlela intervened because his brother panicked. “Vulindlela wasn’t armed and didn’t pose a real danger to him. “I will open a case against the cop who shot my son.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Inanda cops were on patrol when a 20-year-old man allegedly hit an officer with a brick. “The officer fired a shot and the suspect was wounded in the leg,” she said. “He was arrested and taken to hospital under police guard.” She said the suspect will be charged with assault, crimen injuria and obstructing police work.
