A BRIDE with a competitive streak went to bitchy extremes
to make sure her bridesmaids looked fat and ugly at her wedding day. According to New Zealand Herald, an Australian woman
named only as Penny had asked her two sisters to be her bridesmaids on her big
day. The bride-to-be told Whimn that she and her sisters had
always been competitive. "I wasn't as hot and popular as my older sister,
Maggie, and I wasn't as cute and fun as my younger sister, Charlie. I was just
Penny in the middle. But I found a man who loved me for me and I couldn't be
happier," she said. "With all the planning, and after meeting with the
photographer and discussing dresses with my sisters, I started to think about
what my wedding photos were going to look like. Well, probably the more correct
statement would be that I started to obsess over them." Penny started to plot how she could make sure she would
be the slimmest, hottest of the sisters at her wedding. Since they all lived
together, she came up with a cunning plan. Penny said: "We're all fair skinned and blond, and I
demanded that the bridesmaid dresses were a neon yellow that made them look
washed out and slightly ill. I told them I was going for a fun, party look but
I was thrilled that colour made them both look pale. "But by far the worst thing I did was to fatten up
my sisters in the months leading up to the wedding. Every morning I was a
picture of sunshine and morning glow as I insisted on making breakfast
smoothies for everyone. I told them I wanted us all to look our best on the big
day, so I was making them this special slimming smoothie." While Penny crammed her sisters’ smoothies with fattening
ingredients, she made sure hers only contained low-sugar fruit and coconut
water. “By the time my wedding rolled around, both my sisters
had to have their dresses altered to accommodate their thickening waistlines,"
said Penny. She admits to feeling slightly guilty whenever she looks
at her wedding photos.
