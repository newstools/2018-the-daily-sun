THE families of the dead whose graves were violated in Jenezana Cemetery, Tongaat, north of Durban, want eThekwini Municipality to compensate them. Jenezana Cemetery has become a happy hunting ground for evil thieves. Over 20 granite slabs have been stole from the cemetery. Other graves have been vandalised. Princess Ngema (47) from Hambanathi said she was shocked when she visited the cemetery last Monday. “Once in a while, we come to pray and clean the four family graves,” said Princess. “I was lost for words when I discovered that my brother’s grave had been robbed of its tombstone. “I was confused and upset. “Later I realised that other graves next to his had also been tampered with.” Princess said she saw what looked like truck tyre marks next to the disturbed graves. “We are saddened by this incident because the dead are supposed to be left to rest in peace. “We want the municipality to do something about this because we spent a lot of money on these tombstones.” “The municipality should have had security measures in place to ensure this does not happen.” Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube condemned the theft and vandalism of the graves. “We’re disturbed by these reports of people who not respect a cemetery. “We urge cops to swiftly arrest the culprits,” said Dube-Ncube. “We also urge the municipality to ensure that adequate security measures are put in place to avoid such incidents happening again.” Mandla Nsele, eThekwini spokesman, said: “We strongly condemn these worrying acts. “This unpleasant and unwanted trend is slowly becoming a big problem in the province. “We will tighten our security at this cemetery.”
