THREE family members who died after a petrol bomb burned their house were buried in Sekgakgapeng, Limpopo, on Saturday. Hendrick Kekana (64) and his grandkids Kamogelo (5) and Sadie (2) died last week after their mum Kedibone’s ex-boyfriend allegedly torched their house. Hundreds of residents, as well as Mogalakwena and Waterberg municipal officials, attended the funeral. Kedibone can’t walk properly after sustaining burn wounds. When she dumped him, the ex-boyfriend allegedly threatened the family and threw a petrol bomb into their house. He was arrested in Zebediela last Tuesday and briefly appeared in the Mokerong Magistrates Court. He will appear again on Wednesday. Speaking on behalf of the family, Florah Somba said: “Our spirits are still down and all the family members are still traumatised. We need counselling.” Acting Waterberg mayor Sara Mamonyane told Daily Sun: “We’re relieved that there’s a task team probing this matter. “We’re thankful to residents for allowing the law to take its course and for not taking the law into their own hands. “Whoever is responsible for releasing the suspect after he was taken to Mahwelereng Police Station by residents a day before the incident must face the music. “The police should take protection orders seriously.”
