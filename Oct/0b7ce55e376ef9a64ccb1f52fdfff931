KHAYELITSHA fire victims received more help yesterday. Human Settlements Minister Nomaindiya Mfeketho gave the victims food parcels and other things that were been donated by Gift of the Givers. The minister handed out the donations at Thusong Community Hall in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. Mfeketho told the victims that government knew that their most basic need now was to get material to rebuild their homes. She said they held a meeting with the City of Cape Town, the South African National Civic Organisation and Khayelitsha Development Forum to talk about how the houses should be rebuilt. Gogo Ntombentsha Juku (68) is one of the victims. She said: “We are thankful that we are getting donations because we need all the help we can get.” Ali Sablat, manager at Gift of the Givers, said they had been in the area since the fire occurred. “We will be here until the victims are back on their feet. We still need donations,” said Sablat. “We’ve managed to give the victims things like blankets, new clothes, school shoes, stationery packs and food parcels. “School uniforms, mattresses and building material will follow,” he said “Gift of the Givers will also be providing a hot nutritious meal to the affected victims.” Lunga Schoeman, assistant manager at Shoprite, said they decided to help as their shop was supported by the victims. “It has become the responsibility of shops, especially local ones, to help,” said Schoeman. He said they would search for the unknown woman who apparently gave birth in her shack and try to help her.
