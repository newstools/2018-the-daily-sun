A HEARTBROKEN mum who smothered her baby by mistake after downing half a bottle of vodka this week walked free from court. According to the Sun, on 17 November 2016 Stacey Atkinson (30) from Liverpool, England passed out on the sofa with her infant daughter Chloe lying on her chest. When she woke up three hours later, she discovered to her horror that she had accidentally rolled over on to the baby. Discovering that Chloe was now lifeless, Stacey became "hysterical" and shouted to Chloe's father, who was sleeping upstairs. They frantically tried to breathe life in to her while waiting for paramedics. Tragically, the baby’s life couldn’t be saved. Stacey appeared for sentencing at Liverpool Crown Court on Monday, having already pleaded guilty to wilfully neglecting Chloe. She was given a 12 month suspended sentence. Judge Andrew Menary told her: "I have no doubt you're truly remorseful for what you have done and have learned from this bitter experience. "At the time you had two older children. Since these tragic events you and your partner have been blessed with a new daughter. "The authorities have investigated this matter and are perfectly satisfied you and your partner in all other respects are loving, caring and perfectly capable parents. "They have no concerns about the welfare of the children or your ability to provide love, care, support and nurturing for them as you no doubt would have loved to have done for Chloe."
