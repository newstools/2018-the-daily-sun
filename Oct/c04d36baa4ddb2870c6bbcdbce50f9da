THERE is no imposter! This is according to Apostle Stanley Radzilani, who insists the Limpopo premier wanted to have an affair with his wife. Radzilani claimed Premier Stan Mathabatha spoke to his wife Florence on the phone on Monday and suggested they have an affair. Florence is the mayor of Vhembe Municipality. Speaking on Capricorn FM, Radzilani said: “It’s the voice of Florence, who is my wife, and the other voice is the chairman of the province.” Mathabatha is also the ANC’s provincial chairman. “The reason you have a recording is because Florence is an outstanding woman and the wife of a pastor,” he said. In a recorded phone conversation, the alleged impersonator addressed as chairman is proposing an affair, while the woman asked when the feelings started because they have known each other for a long time. She also said she respected him as a family man and said she was married to a pastor. The woman asked if the chairman really loved her and the man said their marriages would not be affected by their affair because it would strengthen both families. Kenny Mathivha, spokesman for the premier, said: “The impersonator has been extremely good at imitating Mathabatha’s voice to the extent of convincing some of his close comrades that it was him. We have reported the impersonator to law enforcement agencies.” The pastor confirmed that a call was recorded during a church service on Sunday to clear his wife’s name. She is implicated in Advocate Terry Motau’s report, “The Great Bank Heist”.
