DOCTORS and nurses living in the hospital staff residence in Limpopo are being targeted by criminals at night. The thugs steal their belongings. Last week, George Masebe, Zebediela, Matlala and Helen Franz hospitals reported to the department that staff were victims of crime. The crimes often take place at hospitals situated in villages. Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba said the department was concerned about the rise in crime. “We’ve learnt with great shock about unfortunate incidents in which doctors and nurses were being attacked at staff residences,” she said. “While the department is working hard to improve security measures, we are appealing to anyone with information to come forward so that the people who are carrying out these attacks can be arrested. “I encourage the residents to make use of the existing structures to fight such criminal activities in our hospitals.”
