TV and radio personality, club DJ and all-round super woman, Thando ‘Thabooty’ Thabethe is in the prime of her life. Not only is she on 5FM’s afternoon drive time show five days a week, she is also on the newly premiered yet acclaimed TV drama, Housekeepers, she has lucrative deals with brands such as Ciroc and she is busier than ever before. We can only wonder, where does she find the stamina to do it all? Well, this weekend Thando shared that her resilient nature comes from a very sad and traumatic past. “What people don’t understand is that once you have seen your father commit suicide, and your brother’s bloody dead body...you become UNSHAKEN!!! I am UNSHAKEN AND EVERYDAY, EVERYDAY I CHOOSE HAPPINESS,” she said. It is this traumatic experience that has made Thabooty as strong as a rock, unshaken in the face of negative criticism flying her way as one of SA’s most recognizable faces. And because of her resilience, Thando has soared to unimaginable heights, traversing TV, radio, acting, fashion and modeling. It is almost as if she is now in the “summer” season of her life. And it is for that exact reason that she covers the November issue of Cosmopolitan Magazine, titled “Summer According to Thando Thabethe”. Thabooty is radiant on the cover of the magazine in a black nylon and mesh body suit from Guess plus a short bob showing off her stunning face. To top it all off, Thabooty is embracing her banging body like it’s nobody’s business as she shares behind-the-scenes shots from her Cosmo cover which is available on newsstands right now.
