Rapper and entrepreneur, Siyabonga ‘Slikour’ Metane’s summer body dreams have been brought to an abrupt halt. The Slikour on Life founder is currently walking with the help of crutches while there is a cast on his right foot. That means, no more exercising for him for at least another six weeks. The rapper told The Juice that he injured his foot while jogging on Monday evening. “I was running at night and I was trying to get off the side of the road and get on the tar. Half of my foot was on the pavement and the other on the road. That literally bent or strained my muscle and something around my bone cracked. I had mad swelling,” he said. But, the former Skwatta Kamp member did find the funnier side of his injury. “I’m about to make handicap parking my bitch. I’m about to Parallel Park sideways on that mothereffa,” he said on Instagram. Fans have wished Slikour a full and speedy recovery. I’m about to make handicap parking my bitch. I’m about to parallel park sideways on that mothereffa. A post shared by  Siya (@siyametane) on Oct 8, 2018 at 10:32am PDT
