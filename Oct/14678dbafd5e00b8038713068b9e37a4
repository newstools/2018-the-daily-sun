 Nhlanhla “Sgaqa” Chiliza has been cleared on charges of attempted rape by the Durban Magistrates Court. Chiliza was arrested in August after being accused of raping a 13-year-old girl, while she was alone at home in Lamontville, south of Durban. After the alleged rape, the girl reportedly told friends at school and they approached a teacher. Following that the teacher called the girl’s mother and encouraged her to lay a charge. During Chiliza’s bail application, he pleaded not guilty. Chiliza was accused of a Schedule 6 offence and could go to prison for the rest of his life if found guilty. The glamorous gqom dancer was on R5 000 bail. “Afrotainment stands firm against any abuse on women and children. We allowed Mr Chiliza to take time off to deal with the charges that were laid against him.” We are pleased to announce he is back at work as of today and we can’t wait to see him entertaining the masses around South Africa and abroad,” Afrotainment owner Dj Tira said.
