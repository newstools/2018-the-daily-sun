TWO men were killed and three others injured after the
community of Olievenhoutbosch assaulted them. ER24’s Russel Meiring said paramedics, and Copwatch
Security, were called to a house by the local authorities, for what was
believed to be a shooting incident. “On arrival, paramedics found three men lying in a garden of
a residence, surrounded by members of the community,” Meiring said. Paramedics assessed the men and found that all three men had
been assaulted. One was found to be in a critical condition while the two
others were had sustained moderate injuries. Meiring said paramedics treated the patients and provided
the critically injured man with advanced life support interventions. After handing over the three patients at the hospital, ER24
paramedics were called again to Olievenhoutbosch for another incident. “On arrival, paramedics found the local authorities already
in attendance. Two men were found lying in the middle of the road,” Meiring
said. One man was found with a gunshot wound to his head while the
other man had sustained a serious head injury. “Unfortunately, both men had already succumbed to their
injuries. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead,” Meiring
added.
