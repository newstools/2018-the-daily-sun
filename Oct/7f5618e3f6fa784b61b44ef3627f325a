Ocsober is an Australian fundraising initiative that
encourages people to give up alcohol for the month of October. The organisation says the money raised by voluntary
participants in the initiative goes to Life Education Australia. According to Ocsober, three quarters of deaths among young
people aged 15 and 24 are avoidable. It says the three leading causes of death in this age group in
Australia are suicide, road deaths and drug overdose. However, many people are split on whether they should join the initiative and stop drinking alcohol for a month or just continue enjoying their favorite drink.
