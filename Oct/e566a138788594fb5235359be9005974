SIMON Sikhosana is a very angry man. The 42-year-old from Moloto Village in Mpumalanga said KwaMhlanga Hospital let his son Sibusiso (11) suffer pain for a whole week. Simon told Daily Sun he took Sibusiso to the hospital after he fell out of a tree on 8 September. He said although Sibusiso was in serious pain, doctors said his arm wasn’t broken, after doing an X-ray, and just gave him painkillers. “The painkillers they gave him didn’t work. When we got home from hospital, my son screamed in pain all night,” Simon said. The father said Sibusiso screamed in pain for a whole week until he took him to Steve Biko Hospital in Tshwane. “I decided to take him to Steve Biko, where doctors found his arm had been fractured. “ If I had not gone to another hospital, he would still be in pain. “He spent the whole week at home and didn’t write his exams. I want the hospital to pay for this because I don’t like what happened.” Simon told Daily Sun his son could have been left crippled by doctors who didn’t do their work properly. Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said they were investigating the matter. He said people should report problems to health facilities so action could be taken. “The department encourages the patient to come back to the hospital for clinical management,” Malamule said.
