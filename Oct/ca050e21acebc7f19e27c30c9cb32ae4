LIFE is still hard for Lawrence Songoane. Last month, Daily Sun reported on how Lawrence’s employer refused to allow him back to work after he was discharged from hospital. The employer claimed Lawrence was dead. Now Lawrence has discovered that his UIF money has been paid to the wrong person. “The person who assisted me at the labour department was shocked when he discovered that the money was paid to the wrong person,” said Lawrence. “He called his supervisor, who also saw that my UIF money had been paid out with her signature.” Lawrence said the officials claimed someone in the department had forged the supervisor’s signature to make the payment. Lawrence said he and his manager at Protea Coin Group in Rustenburg, North West, didn’t see eye to eye. “The trouble started when my manager wanted me to make a false accident report. “My refusal didn’t go down well with my bosses. They then claimed I was dead after I was admitted to hospital after my eye was injured,” he told the People’s Paper. Sias Visagie, branch manager at Protea Coin Group, asked the SunTeam to send questions on a letterhead, but he didn’t respond. After weeks of following up, Visagie said: “You may take the matter up with our human resources department.” But he failed to provide any contact details. Makhosonke Buthelezi, a spokesman for the labour department, said the matter would be reported to their risk management unit for further investigation.
