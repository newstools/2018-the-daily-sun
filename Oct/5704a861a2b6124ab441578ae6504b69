SOCCER player Andile Jali has been granted R1 500 bail after spending a night in jail. The Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder yesterday appeared at Hatfield Magistrates Court in Tshwane. He was granted bail on condition that he doesn’t contact his wife or interfere with investigations. His next appearance is on 6 December. Jali spent the night behind bars after he was arrested on charges of malicious damage to property and assault. He allegedly assaulted his wife Nonhle Ndala, slashed her car tyres and crashed into a neighbour’s car. The alleged incident took place at their home in eastern Tshwane in the early hours of Monday morning. Witnesses said Jali was drunk when he was arrested. Police officers allegedly had to give the midfielder water in an attempt to sober him up. Daily Sun has also learnt that Jali has a pending case of drunk driving after being arrested by the Metro cops in May. At the time, it was reported that he was 15 times over the legal drinking limit. Jali’s lawyer Sabelo Sibiya refused to confirm whether the soccer player had a pending drunk driving case, and told the People’s Paper he wasn’t mandated to speak to the media.
