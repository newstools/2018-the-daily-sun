TV personality, Minnie Dlamini plans on doing more behind-the-scenes work in the near future. The star was on The Drive with Mo Flava and Masechaba Ndlovu on Metro FM recently and spoke about her future plans. Minnie was the brains behind her three-part docu-series, Becoming Mrs Jones which detailed her journey to marrying her now husband, Quinton Jones. “I’ve still got an appetite for television, sort of being on camera, but I do think in the next couple of years I’ll be moving very far away from on-camera and really dedicating most of my time to production,” she said. She went on to share the reason behind her wanting to move onto production work. “I love the idea of creating content and shaping society … it is beautiful. I feel like it’s the natural progression in my career,” she told The Drive team. Minnie also said that there is a lot more money in production work and owning productions than just being a face. “It’s a way more lucrative business than being on camera,” she continued. Minnie said that her biggest fear is not creating the kind of quality television that people expect. “Is it good television, is it breaking the boundaries, am I staying true to the brand that I’ve build already, and am I able to translate that into my new business?’' Minnie posed.
