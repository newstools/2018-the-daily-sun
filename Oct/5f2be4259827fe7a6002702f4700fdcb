VHAVENDA King Tony Mphephu Ramabulana has promised to pay back over R17 million to VBS. The Great Bank Heist report released by Advocate Terry Motau last week named him as one of more than 50 people who received money from the bank illegally. The report states that Ramabulana received a payment of R17,7 million. “I irreversibly offer to repay any amount which is shown to have been the proceeds of the illegalities in the report. This will happen as soon as they are calculated and I’m directed where the repayment must be made,” the king said. He said the theft from his people was contrary to the vision his father had as a founding member of the bank in 1982. Meanwhile, the ANC’s executive committee in Limpopo will sit at Frans Mohlala House in Polokwane today to discuss a way forward and measures to be taken against those implicated in the VBS scandal. The ANC’s top five in Limpopo will meet the top six at Luthuli House to explain themselves. ANC Limpopo treasurer Danny Msiza has been labelled the mastermind behind municipalities investing in VBS, despite it being against the Municipal Financial Act. However, he’s challenging the report and demanding a retraction of allegations that he took part in the looting.
