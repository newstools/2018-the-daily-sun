PATIENTS and employees at Addington Hospital fear for their lives after two fires broke out at the hospital on Thursday. The first fire broke out at about 7.30am and the second one at about 2.30pm. The fires broke out near fire escape routes where piles of rubbish were being kept for collection. A nurse said employees were worried because they heard a third force was to blame for the blaze. The nurse said although the fires were eventually put out, she and her colleagues were still not at ease. “We look after many patients, some of whom are very sick. “We are worried by incidents like these because we and the patients aren’t safe,” said the nurse. A patient said: “Some of us are very sick and it would’ve been hard for us to run for our lives if the fire spread.” After visiting the hospital to assess the damage, Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said the department was doing its best to ensure patients were treated in a safe environment. He said the department opened an arson case at Point Police Station. “There’s something wrong here. “An act of vandalism isn’t far-fetched,” he said. “Both fires broke out at the escape routes in a similar fashion. “We want the culprits to be arrested for gambling with people’s lives and compromising the safety of patients. “The department will also make means to improve security at Addington and other hospitals.” KZN cop spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said no one reported the matter to the police. She said: “No case was at opened at the Point and Durban cop shops, which are the closest stations to the hospital.”
