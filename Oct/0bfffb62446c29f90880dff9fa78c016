THE Kosovo Neighbourhood Watch and the community got a boost on Tuesday. This after the City of Cape Town delivered a 12 metre shipping container which will serve as the base for operations by the team in the Langa squatter camp. It will also be a community hub where service delivery matters can be reported. Councillor Mzwakhe Nqavashe, the safety portfolio committee chairman, said: “The application for this container was made in 2015, while we were still conducting training for the Kosovo Neighbourhood Watch. “The structure has a kitchen and toilet. It’s fitted with plug points and insulated with wood. It will soon be connected to the electricity and waste water networks. “I have also motivated for a permanent clerk who can assist the community with other city service delivery matters.” In Mitchells Plain, the Westgate Neighbourhood Watch got a similar container in August, which is currently being revamped. Councillor Jean-Pierre Smith said the containers were meant to act as central gathering points and to help improve operations. Apart from the container, the Kosovo patrollers received jackets, torches and radios. “The importance of community policing should not be underestimated. We have witnessed firsthand how crime has dropped in areas with well organised and active neighbourhood watch groups,” said Smith.
