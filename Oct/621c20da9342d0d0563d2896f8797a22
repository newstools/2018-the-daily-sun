“MZANSI made a big mistake by legalising weed. A lot of people are going to suffer because of it.” These were the words of award-winning artist Zahara, who told Daily Sun legalising weed does not mean it won’t kill people. The Constitutional Court recently ruled that the personal use of dagga is not a criminal offence. Zahara, whose real name is Bulelwa Mkutukana, told the People’s Paper young people were already suffering from drug abuse. “How much more are they going to abuse drugs, knowing they won’t be bust when found with dagga? There are legal guns and they still kill people. The government should have done this differently.” She said people do unpleasant things when they are high. “We are faced with serious issues as we speak. Now that they will smoke freely, our troubles will be doubled,” she said. Zahara said drugs are killing the youth .“There is no future with the youth involved with drugs. “I hope they rethink this decision,” she said. She said not only will the dagga users suffer, but also the community at large. “With dagga in free use, we might see an increase in crime, which is bad for our community.” The SunTeam spoke to people to hear their take on the star’s opinion. Tumi Sokhulu (26) from Meadowlands in Soweto said: “Zahara must take a chill pill. “Dagga is not only for smoking. A lot can be done with it that could benefit society.” Mbuyiselo Vilakazi (30) from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni said: “Leave dagga alone, Zahara. “We want it and are glad they gave us permission to use it. If you don’t want it, don’t use it.” Thokozani Sithole (42) from Lenasia, south of Joburg supported Zahara: “This means trouble for us.”
