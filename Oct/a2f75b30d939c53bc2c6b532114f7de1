FOR 40 years, Matome Moto has had no peace. He was worried he would die before he had a proper house. The 98-year-old madala’s life was shattered when he lost his sight at the age of 58. This forced him to resign from his job in Tshwane and return home. He had to share his rundown, three-roomed house in Ga-Madikana Village outside Bochum, Limpopo with his two sons and their children. He approached the office of the premier, seeking help and to be given a proper house. Madala’s wish has finally come true. The Limpopo First Lady Trust ensured that a house was built for him. Zorha Khan Developers came on board and on Wednesday, a four-roomed house was officially handed over to madala’s son, Obed (64), as the madala was ill. Limpopo MEC for Co-operative Governance and Human Settlements, Jerry Ndou, said this showed they cared for the people they served. “We make the lives of our people better. Our mandate is to make sure services are brought to them,” said Ndou. “Some people think we are doing this because the election is around the corner. Yes, we want to win the election, but we have been doing this for years. “We have already built 1,3 million houses for our people.” Representing The First Lady Trust, Zorha Khan said: “We are so glad to have built this house. “We hope his heart will now find peace as he will be safe at all times.” Obed said they were grateful to everyone who made sure they had a proper house. “This is the best gift we have ever received and we will forever be grateful,” he said.
