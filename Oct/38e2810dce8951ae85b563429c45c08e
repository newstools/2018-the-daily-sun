EVER since he was declared dead by Home Affairs, his retirement has been on hold and he has had to keep working. Madala Amos Nkosi (70) from Jules, Jeppestown in Joburg was assumed dead in 2014, according to the Pretoria office of Home Affairs. This was after the madala visited Home Affairs in 2014 to change his old ID he had been using for 28 years, and apply for a new one. He got the shock of his life when they told him that he was declared dead in 2014 at Madadeni, Newcastle. “They advised me to go to the police station and compile an affidavit stating that I am alive. I even went to the place where my death was declared, but all that didn’t help me get an ID,” said the gatvol madala. Amos said he visited different offices of Home Affairs in Gauteng and KZN trying to get help, but all his efforts were in vain. He said he couldn’t even consider retiring where he worked because he wouldn’t be able to access his retirement funds. “I’ve been working for over 25 years and I want to retire and be with my family at home, but I’m afraid I won’ be able to access my retirement funds.” He also cannot apply for a social grant at Sassa because he doesn’t have an ID. “A person of my age shouldn’t be working but I don’t have a choice because I’m the breadwinner,” he said. The desperate madala appealed to Daily Sun for help. Home Affairs spokesman, Thabo Mokgola said the manager in charge of the relevant unit would contact Amos.
