RESIDENTS of Joe Slovo, Milnerton, no longer have to travel long distances to buy medicine. In June, accounting student Thembekile Mahintsho (22) opened a medicine store in the area. “Mangethe’s Medi-Store sells over-the-counter and traditional medicine,” he said. “People come at night and my door is always open to them because I’m providing a service that was previously not available in the area. “I buy medicine from the same place as well known pharmacies but my prices aren’t sky-high. “The plan is to have a branch in every township.” He advised aspiring entrepreneurs to make sacrifices for their dreams. “Young people have great ideas. “We just need guidance and funding from the right people,” said Thembikile. Customer Mayedwa Bangani said Thembekile brought a necessary service to the community. Mayedwa said: “He’s very helpful. My child was once sick and I knocked on Thembekile’s door at night. He opened the door and helped my child, who was taken to hospital the following day.”
