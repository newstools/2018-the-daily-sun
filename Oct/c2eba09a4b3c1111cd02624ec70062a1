TALITA Maseko (45) says she paid a funeral parlour for years but when her mum died in December, she received nothing but bad treatment. Talita, from GaRankuwa View, Tshwane claimed the undertaker owed her money and even assaulted her daughter! Talita said she joined the parlour in 2011 but when her mum died, she couldn’t get hold of the owner. He ignored her calls and she had to take her mum’s body to another mortuary. “When I spoke to him, he told me to use my own money and he would refund me but never did.” Talita took him to court and he finally agreed to pay the money. “But I still haven’t been paid.” Talita said on Sunday she went with her daughter and son to the undertaker’s house but his wife called her daughter a bitch and the owner assaulted her daughter. She decided to ask the People’s Paper for help. When Daily Sun contacted funeral parlour owner Amos Kekana, he said he is a service provider. “The court said I must give her R3 500 and I have given her some of the money.” He said it wasn’t his fault that Talita’s mum was buried at another parlour. “She decided to take her elsewhere and I agreed to give her the money as she forced me to. “She goes around telling people I didn’t help her and I have lost clients. They came to my house and insulted me, saying I’d assaulted her daughter.” He said he would pay her. “If she keeps spreading lies, I’ll sue her.”
