Tax increases, ever increasing petrol prices and how to save Mzansi’s state-owned enterprises is what Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is expected to cover in his mini-budget speech. The recently sworn-in finance minister is expected to deliver his first mid-term budget speech on Wednesday. South Africans may be expecting Tito Mboweni to touch on issues that affected South African’s pockets like the petrol price, and how government is planning on reviving the economy. Mboweni is also expected to talk about the R50-billion stimulus plan that President Cyril Ramaphosa announced, that is set aside for reviving the economy. He is faced with the challenge of Mzansi’s embattled state-owned enterprises. Mboweni may likely explain how the state will improve the financial position of SOEs. As Mzansi is still feeling the pinch of the technical recession, many will expect to hear what solutions Mboweni has in terms of pulling in investments.
