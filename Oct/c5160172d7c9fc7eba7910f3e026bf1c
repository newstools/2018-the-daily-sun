THE residents of Lwandle, Strand near Cape Town want to know why speed bumps were erected on a road riddled with potholes. Some motorists said the potholes have the same effect as the speed bumps. “You cannot speed when there are potholes!” said angry driver Mbuyiselo Zali. The residents asked for the speed bumps because of speeding cars but that was over seven months ago. “We appreciate the speed bumps but we cannot celebrate mediocrity. Who in their right minds would do something like this? “They must come back and fix the road as they did in Somerset West. If you notice, roads built by the municipality are of poor quality compared to national roads. Why is that? We need to question this,” said Lethubuhle Dyantyi. EFF’s regional chair Unathi Ntame said: “When these roads damage taxis, the City of Cape Town is quick to impound taxis, forgetting it has caused this mess.” MMC for transport and urban development Brett Herron said they were aware of the potholes as they often occur during winter. “The roads and stormwater department will attend to the potholes in various areas, including Strand,” he said.
