DRESSING up in expensive clothes usually gets the compliments flowing on social media. A group of friends posted a picture of themselves at a party, and the image went viral on social media. But instead of being complimented for their stylish clothes, they were criticised on Twitter. The men were blasted for spending money on less important items like expensive clothes instead of investing in a good cause. An account called Black Twitter SA wrote: “Imagine having a boyfriend who dresses up like this! “Can’t you build generational wealth instead of spending money on petty things?” But Joska Mataozen, one of the men in the picture, gave the group’s critics a piece of his mind. He said they had dressed up for a party at a friend’s house in Middelburg, Mpumalanga. “People like to talk about things they don’t know about,” said Joska. “We like to look great every time we go out. The theme at the party was all-white, and we weren’t the only ones who were dressed like that. “Dogs rarely bark at stationary objects. “When people talk about you, it’s a sign that you’re growing and progressing. “You will never reach your destination if you stop and throw stones at every dog that barks,” he said. Some people on social media defended the group of friends. Palesa Karishma wrote on Facebook: “It’s sad that people are so quick to judge how others spend their hard-earned money.”
