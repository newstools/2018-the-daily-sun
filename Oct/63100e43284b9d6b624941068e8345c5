MORE than 100 interns who marched to the Mpumalanga provincial government offices last Wednesday will finally be paid. They will get their money from Monday. The interns refused to hand over their memorandum to Premier Refilwe Mtshweni’s representatives. They demanded that the premier should personally accept the memorandum. According to Desmond Moela, who is in charge of the youth desk at the premier’s office, they met the relevant parties and agreed that 255 interns would get their money, starting from Monday. He said the other 266 interns would be paid on 2 November. “We’ve committed ourselves as government to working closely with the interns until the last day of their contracts. “We are mandated to ensure that the interns are paid every month, and we are exactly doing that so that we don’t find ourselves in a crisis. “From now on, everything will be in order,” he said. Innocent Maphanga, an intern at the premier’s office, said they had been promised the money.
