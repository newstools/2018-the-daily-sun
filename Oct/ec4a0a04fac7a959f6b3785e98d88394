Afro-pop singer, Lungisa Xhamela has made two major announcement over the past week. The first of which is that he has found a new recording home at Gallo Records. Lungisa signed a recording deal with the company just over a week ago but will remain with Vth Season as his management team. “We are pleased to be working alongside Gallo Records to release new exciting music by Lungisa Xhamela and make sure that his music touches everyone across the country,” said manager to the stars, Raphael Benza from Vth Season. This comes just three months after the singer announced that he had signed with Universal Music Publishing but no word yet as to what happened to that deal. In addition to this big move, Lungisa has also dropped a new single, a Xhosa love letter to Mzansi women. Titled, iLoveLetter, the song was a surprised single which came out last week to coincide with the Gallo Records signing. “I’m excited to embark on a new journey with new partnerships, and iLoveLetter is just a taste of the music to come that really expresses who I am,” said Lungisa. The song is written by Ntsika Fana and produced by Eternal Africa, and is an homage to the beauty of women. iLoveLetter is now available on all major digital platforms to stream or download.
