DA MP ANGEL Khanyile hosted an event for men to discuss violence against women on Saturday. The talk was held at the Stanwest Community Hall in Standerton, Mpumalanga. Khanyile said: “We have realised the rate of gender-based violence is increasing every day and we have noted that in most instances, men are the perpetrators. We decided to have an event for men to raise these issues. “We hope they come up with solutions to eliminate gender-based violence.” She said the event was a success and men agreed to stand together to fight violence through the establishment of an NGO. Bishop Joshua Maponga, who took part in the event, said the reality was that men were physically stronger than women. He said men were grateful to be given the opportunity to participate in the conversation. “Every man must have two wives. The first must be land ownership and the second a woman. We want land to support our women.” Apostle Isaac Sithole said men needed to get rid of their animal instincts to become real men. He said it felt good to help spread this message. Pharmacist Bonang Tloti said the event had changed the way a lot of men thought. “The nice thing was that it was a man-to-man talk where we discussed how we can save our communit.” Tloti said they would register an NGO at the beginning of next month to deal with the problems men were facing, which contributed to violence against women and children.
