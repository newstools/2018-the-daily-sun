THE GIYANI Stadium in Limpopo is the place to be this weekend. Africa’s music giants will set the stage alight on Saturday at the first The Link Up music festival. The music extravaganza is organised by Baks and Daks Entertainment, who will also launch their record label with the same name. Ndamulelo Molava, the event’s spokesman, said the aim of the show was to bring music legends and local artists together on one stage. He said the line-up included music heavyweights such as Thomas Chauke, Oliver Mtukudzi and Colbert Mukwevho, Joe Shirimani and Penny Penny. “There’s something for everyone at The Link Up with the likes of hip hop star Cassper Nyovest, MizoPhyll, Ms Cosmo, DJ Ganyani, Master KG and Team Mosha,” he said. The event and record label are the brainchild of Khwathelani Nemabaka and Dakalo Mamutshavhi. Ndamulelo said the two were passionate about uplifting artists from their province. “While Khwathelani was still working in corporate affairs, he invested money in a few artists from Limpopo to help them share their music with the rest of South Africa, the continent and ultimately the world,” said Ndamulelo. Khwathelani then teamed up with Dakalo, who was also enthusiastic about the talent in the province and wanted to see local artists grow. “The vision is to grow the company beyond provincial boundaries because artists are faced with the same problems of exclusion all over the country. “We hope to be the company that introduces those artists to the mainstream market. “Besides being a record label, we would also like to revive the entertainment space by hosting shows that promote the culture of inclusion,” said Ndamulelo.
