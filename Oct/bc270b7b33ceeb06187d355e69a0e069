 Venda King
Toni Mphephu has reportedly offered to pay back the money. According
to eNCA, the King has offered to pay back any money that can be proved that he
received illegally from VBS Bank. Forensic investigator Advocate Terry Motauâ€™s report, the
VhaVenda king received over R17-million
from the bank. News24 reported that Motau's report supports early findings
by curator Anoosh Rooplal, who dragged Matodzi and Madzonga before the South
Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg to be provisionally sequestrated earlier
this year, along with three other executives. Motau undertook a five-month investigation which included
the review of documents seized from VBS and Vele Investments, VBS' largest
shareholder, and conducted extensive interviews with the role players. Motau also recommended that VBS be liquidated, as he does
not believe there is any prospect of saving it. "It is corrupt and rotten to the core. Indeed, there is
hardly a person in its employ in any position of authority who is not, in some
way or the other, complicit." Motau found there was "widescale looting and looting of
the monies placed on deposit at VBS". He carefully sets out the methods of those who had
"captured" VBS through payments of large sums of money to the various
perpetrators of the looting scheme "as a reward for their
participation".
