Fans are concerned today about rapper and entrepreneur, K.O’s well-being after a frightening post went out on his Instagram page. K.O, real name Ntokozo Mdluli, took to Instagram last night to let fans know that he is not okay and is currently seeking God’s divine intervention on his life. “Eloi Eloi lama sabachtani” cried Jesus on the cross (my God, my God why have You forsaken me). Exact same words rolling off the tip of my tongue as I stand at the crossroads of my life. I took too many losses for a man with a heart as big as mine and this dark hour has lasted over two years! Lead me to the light,” he said. This left fans sad and confused but still confident that their Skhanda Gawd would survive this trying time. They, together with industry peers, have sent K.O messages of support and love. The rapper has openly spoken about suffering from depression following the death of fellow rap icon, ProKid two months ago. It has also been widely reported that he has not been getting booked for gigs lately and so money has been a bit tight. This on top of the drama surrounding his record label, which he ditched after founding it. He left Cashtime Fam for SONY in a one-album deal that didn’t go far. He is now with Vth Season. “Eloi Eloi lama sabachtani” cried Jesus on the cross (my God, my God why have You forsaken me). Exact same words rolling off the tip of my tongue as I stand at the crossroads of my life. I took too many losses for a man with a heart as big as mine and this dark hour has lasted over two years!
