Abakhaya from Lady Frere in Eastern Cape who live in Cape Town are there for each other in good times and bad. Since they started a WhatsApp group to link people from the same villages earlier this year, they are reaping the fruit of unity. When a group member has a birthday, they celebrate together. And when one of them has a problem, they pull together to solve it. Lydia Mene (40) said they recently saved a life through the love they have for each other. “It’s not about braais and parties only in this group. We are here for each other. One of our group members nearly committed suicide because of problems she was going through. The moment we knew about it we rushed to speak to her. We showed her how important her life was to us,” said Lydia. Bayanda Mnamatheli (46) said: “This group also provides a platform for us to teach each other different trades and skills. If one of us is unemployed, we help to find a job,” said Bayanda. On Saturday, Abakhaya members bought lots of meat and booze and spoiled themselves in Mbekweni, near Paarl. Siyabulela Mpoki (42) said since the group was started earlier this year, they had over 200 members. “Even people who are not from Lady Frere are asking to join the group. They are inspired by our unity,” he said.
