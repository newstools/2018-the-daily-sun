PARLIAMENT has been given two years to amend a section of the Divorce Act that discriminates against women married under the Transkei Marriage Act. Yesterday the Constitutional Court ruled that Section 7(3) of the Divorce Act did not give women protection during a divorce. Bukelwa Holomisa, the wife of Contralesa president Chief Patekile Holomisa, approached the court after her appeal was dismissed in the Supreme Court of Appeal. She wanted to know whether they were married in or out of community of property for the purpose of determining how the estate should be divided in divorce proceedings. The couple were married in Mqanduli in the former Transkei in 1995. According to the marriage certificate they were married “without an antenuptial contract”. Under the Transkei Marriage Act this meant the marriage was out of community of property, the default position in Transkei before 2000. The Constitutional Court found there was discrimination in Bukelwa’s case. The court ordered that the matter be referred to the regional court to determine proprietary interests of both parties.
