Former lovers, DJ Zinhle and AKA have come a long way. The musicians, who are parents of three-year-old, Kairo Owethu Forbes have survived many trying times. The tumultuous end to their relationship was a highly-publicized one and got nastier and nastier as more secrets came into the public sphere. When rumours of AKA’s infidelity and secret relationship with Bonang Matheba were finally confirmed, that signaled the end of their relationship. Through all of this, Zinhle took to her blog to expose everything she been through and how much she hated Bonang. Fast-forward to a few years later, law suits have been threatened, things have been said on Twitter and now AKA and Bonang’s relationship has also gone down the toilet. Things had been so bad that no one could have ever imagined Zinhle and AKA not only getting along but actually being nice to each other and wishing each other well. But it seems like the end of AKA and Bonang’s relationship signaled a fresh start for the parents, so much so that people have wondered if they’re back together. They have now put aside their issue aside and made peace, even showing affection to one another on social media. So when Zinhle announced last week that she had joined the judging panel on SABC 1’s reality talent search show 1s and 2s, AKA rushed to cheer her on. “CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW ADVENTURE @DJZinhle,” AKA tweeted.
