THE family of a murdered girl and her nephew will finally get closure. Gabisile Shabane (13) and her 15-month-old nephew Nkosikhona Ngwenya will be buried next Saturday, now that their DNA results are ready. Gabisile, who is living with albinism, and her nephew were kidnapped from their home in Hlalanikahle in Mpumalanga in January. They were forced to drink brake fluid before she was murdered. Prosecutor Fani Mavundla said investigations had been completed and the case would be moved to the high court next year, where the four accused would stand trial. Gabisile’s mum Anna said they were happy that they would finally be able to bury the kids. “We will get closure, now that the accused will speak for themselves at the high court and we can bury our children,” she said. Mavundla said the trial will take place in the Delmas High Court from 19 August to 20 September next year. The four accused are Thokozani Msibi (32), Brilliant Mkhize (26), Knowledge Mhlanga (22) and Themba Thubane (36), who appeared in the Witbank Magistrates Court. ANC eNkangala regional chairman Speedy Mashilo said: “Picketers will be transported by bus. This can happen to anyone, so we need to give our full support to the family.” All four accused are facing two murder charges after their arrest in February. The children’s bodies were found in the same month.
