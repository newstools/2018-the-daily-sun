three former drug addicts have a new lease on life and hope society will forgive them. Thabang Tlharipe (26), Andrew Kgwadi (38) and William Baloyi (23) from Bela-Bela in Limpopo said through society’s support they will make it in life. Thabang told Daily Sun he regretted the precious time he has wasted. “But I also learnt a lot and I’m looking forward to moving on to another chapter,” he said. Thabang said he lost focus due to peer pressure.  When his mum could no longer support him, he started stealing. “The money we used to rob people couldn’t do anything except buy drugs.” Thabang said things got worse and soon he couldn’t spend a single hour without using. Andrew said he had been smoking drugs for almost 20 years. “Getting involved with drugs nearly cost me my life and I regret my poor decisions,” he said. “I ended up joining gangs and started stealing to get money for clothes and drugs. “I started smoking rock cocaine and dagga and soon I was introduced to nyaope.” William also admitted to the People’s Paper that he had messed up but said he had now been born again.
