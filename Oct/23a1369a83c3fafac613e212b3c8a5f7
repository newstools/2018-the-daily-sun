AS THE Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) board
chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama briefed Parliament's Portfolio Committee on
Transport, another Metrorail station was burnt. Several stations in Cape Town have been affected by a vandalism,
fires and theft of cables. Kweyama told Parliament that Prasa is unstable due to the
number of vacancies at managerial level. She added that management appointments will be finalised by
the end of November. Previously the Railway Safety Regulator (RSR) issued PRASA
with a suspension of operating permit, citing agency’s lack of control over
accidents. RSR said the accidents point to major risks within Prasa's
operations and could have dire consequences. On Tuesday, the transport committee was told that the Eastern
Cape only has one operating locomotive, instead of 9. Prasa CEO Sibusiso Sithole told parliament that nine
locomotives have been purchased from Transnet and that the transaction could be
completed by the end of October. He also added that Prasa’s capital expenditure has been
dismal. Sithole said all projects will be reviewed to determine
where money should be allocated.
