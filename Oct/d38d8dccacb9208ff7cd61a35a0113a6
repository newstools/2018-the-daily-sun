A video of a drunk warden on duty has been making rounds on social media since yesterday morning. The video which was taken by a man who is believed to be the superior of the drunk warden made it's way to The Department of Correctional Service. “The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) is aware of a video depicting a drunk official in DCS uniform circulating on social media. The department is deeply appalled and aggrieved by this video,” spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo told All4Women. “A conduct of this nature can never be allowed in DCS, hence an urgent investigation has been instituted.” “The service delivery charter clearly defines what is expected of a correctional official, and how one ought to behave in the line of duty,” said Nxumalo.“The mandate of the Department of Correctional Services is to contribute towards a just, peaceful and safer South Africa, and that demands that our officials must maintain a sound state of mind and be professional in performing their duties.“This matter will be fully investigated and the department condemns this type of behaviour in the strongest possible terms.”
