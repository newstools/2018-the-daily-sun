Singer Nelisiwe Sibiya said if you have heard her sing, you’ve listened to her pray. The actress in Mzansi Magic’s Lockdown is popularly known for her beautiful voice and the genre she invented, called Afrokandi. She’s also written most of the tracks on the Lockdown soundtrack album which was released last Monday. The album tells tales of women who have been abused and gives reasons why they end up in jail. One of the songs is titled Mama Ka Bafana, which she wrote after she buried her mother. She said it touches her soul because of the story behind it. Nelisiwe said Mandla Ngcogwane, the producer of the drama series, asked her questions which got her thinking. He asked what crime would she most likely have committed if she were to be arrested. “Because of the abuse I experienced as a child, I’m certain if I were to be arrested, it would be because of a man. “A man played a big role in making my life miserable. This is the reason I’m passionate about telling women’s stories,” she said. The 26-year-old said music had always been a big part of her life andshe studied musical theatre at the Tshwane University of Technology. “I’ve heard stories of women going to jail and most of them had to protect themselves from men. “No one wants to experience the trauma of being behind bars.” Nelisiwe said she hoped the album would inspire women to stand their ground.
