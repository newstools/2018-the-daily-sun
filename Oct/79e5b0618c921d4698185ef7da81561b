THE prophet took a chance and spent his last R8 on a
SportStake ticket. And the following day, he woke up to find he was R1 million
richer. Speaking to the SunTeam at the Ithuba offices in Joburg, the
50-year-old father of seven from Matatiele, Eastern Cape, said it was his first
time playing SportStake. “I didn’t even know how it was played and I asked my
neighbour to teach me. I decided to play quick pick and to be honest, I was
just taking a chance without expecting anything,” he said. He said he used to play Lotto and PowerBall but last week,
something told him to play SportStake. “I didn’t even have a cent in my pocket when I saw my ticket
had won,” he said with a big smile on his face. He said he lost his job as a labourer in February and things
had not been easy since then. His family was renting a room in Louterwater, Nelson Mandela
Bay, where he was looking for a job. “I fed my family with money I got from people who came for
consultations,” he said. He said he would use the money to build a house for his
family and he would invest what was left over. His 19-year-old son, who travelled to Joburg with him, said
he was very happy for his father. “When he came home and told me he had won R1 million, I
thought he was joking because he likes to make jokes. I only realised he was serious when he told me someone from
Ithuba had called about our flight arrangements,” he said. The winner said he would continue to play because he didn’t
know when he would be lucky again.
