The Timothy Omotoso rape trial continues in court, after Defence
lawyer Peter Daubermann, asked Judge Mandela Makaula to recuse himself from the
case. Omotoso, Zukiswa Sitho (28) and Lusanda Solani (36) are
facing charges of racketeering, violating the sexual offences act, human
trafficking and rape. He has been in prison since his arrest in April last year.
