Orlando Pirates have confirmed that Luvuyo Memela has been ruled out for three weeks and will miss this weekend's Soweto derby against Kaizer Chiefs. The 31-year-old winger was the hero in the last clash between the Soweto giants and scored a brace as the Buccaneers clinched a 3-1 victory. Pirates also announced that veteran midfielder Musa Nyatama is struggling with a knock and will undergo a late fitness test ahead of Saturday's meeting at FNB Stadium. "In terms of injury doubts, winger Luvuyo Memela has been ruled out for this encounter," a statement read of the club's official website. '''Amigo' as he is affectionately known, suffered a knee strain and as a result will be out for three weeks. "Meanwhile, midfielder Musa Nyatama is due to undergo a late fitness test after picking up a knock in the cup win over the Chilli Boys."
