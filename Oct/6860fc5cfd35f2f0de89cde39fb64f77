The best in Africa's travel industry was honoured at the 25th World Travel Awards Africa and Indian Ocean on Saturday in Durban, and South Africa took home a few accolades, including Cape Town International Airport (CTIA) named as Africa's Leading Airport for 2018. This is the second year that the Mother City's airport received the accolade, as the airport is getting ready for summer's peak season that starts in October. Cape Town International has already welcomed Edelweiss which connects the city to Zurich, Condor which connects the city to Frankfurt and Lufthansa with its Munich-to-Cape Town frequencies in operation. “Cape Town International Airport is honoured to once again receive this very important accolade. Being named Africa’s Leading Airport for the second year is extremely gratifying and reinforces the hard work and commitment to excellence demonstrated at this airport in the past 12 months,” said the airport's senior manager of corporate affairs Deidre Davids. The winners of the World Travel Awards are voted for by industry professionals and travellers from around the world, and it seeks to celebrate all the sectors of the global industry. Both Cape Town and OR Tambo International Airport have also been nominated in the global category for World' Leading Airport, which will be announced at the World Travel Awards Grand Final Gala on 1 December in Lisbon, Portugal. CTIA showed a 5.3% increase in passengers in 2017, with a double-digit growth for international passengers over the last few years. In 2016, CTIA pushed past the 10 million passengers mark in December 2016, and repeated it in 2017. “We are anticipating yet another bumper peak season in Cape Town and our team is prepped and ready to welcome all of our visitors to the fairest Cape and to facilitate their movement through the airport en route to their holiday destinations,” says Davids.
