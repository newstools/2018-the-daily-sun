With the final matric exams in full swing, Nomzamo High School pupils in Strand are holding the last study camp for grade 12 pupils. The week-long camp is held on the school premises and teachers tutor pupils in the subjects the school believes they need help with. School principal Eric Mgubanto said this is the last kick to prepare them for the exams and after this, they are all alone. “As teachers we have done everything we can from our side. The aim is to increase our pass rate from last year,” said Mgubanto. The three-year-old school did better than most schools in the Strand area last year. The school received a 66% pass rate last year and want to improve to 70%. SGB chairperson Lumkile Ludziya was impressed by the high turnout at the camp. “This shows that they are hungry for education and want to improve the pass rate of the school. When pupils go home they sometimes do not have a chance to study and this camp provides an opportunity,” said Ludziya. Sinazo Metsing (19) said they will return the favour. “We thank the teachers for going an extra mile and organising this camp for us. They stay with us and work the following day. We will reward them by achieving the results they are hoping for,” said Sinazo.
