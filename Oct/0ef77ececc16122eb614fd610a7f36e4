ELDERLY people were yesterday given free eye screenings and appointments to get spectacles. This was part of a campaign the South African Optometric Association and the Joburg Metro police held at Chiawelo Clinic in Soweto. Caroline Kalane (60) from Doornkop in Soweto thanked the association for offering her an eye test. “I’ve had issues with my eyes for a long time but haven’t got tested because these things are expensive.” Audience Maluleke, president of the association, said it was important for people to have their eyes checked regularly. “Proper eye care is essential for one’s health. Some diseases such as diabetes are often picked up by these tests.” The association also handed out free polarised sunglasses to some of the Metro cops at the event. Elvis Bassie from Falco Milano, which sponsored the sunglasses, said it was important to get proper protection from the sun. He said polarised sunglasses reduced the glare reflecting from flat surfaces such as windscreens, hot tar surfaces and even the hoods of cars. JMPD spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said: “We have had many accidents as a result of drivers not seeing road markings or other cars because they have poor eyesight. “This is why we encourage drivers not to wait until their licence has expired to get their eyes checked.”
