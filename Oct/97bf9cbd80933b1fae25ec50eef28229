GOGO Mohanuoa Matsoso said sticking to one partner has helped her live long. The 104-year-old from Rocklands in Mangaung said after her husband died, she never thought of having another man. Last Monday, her family organised a surprise party for her. Mohanuoa’s birthday was in June, but the family celebrated it this month because it’s a bit warmer. She said: “When I got married to my late husband, I was told by the elders I shouldn’t leave him, even if it was hard. “I was taught to support him, lift up his spirit and make him feel like a king.” She said eating vegetables also had helped her live long. “I was also taught not to eat eggs as they would make me weak as a woman. “I planted vegetables in my backyard to feed my family.” Gogo said she always encouraged her daughters not to leave their husbands. “Women should learn to stick to one partner.”
