BABERWA FC boss Joe Seanego says the decision to give forgotten players Khethowakhe Masuku and Mthokozisi Yende a chance to resurrect their ailing careers has now paid off. The two midfielders, who played for Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs respectively, were down and out without a job before Seanego came to their rescue. The duo have already made their mark in the ABC Motsepe League, as Baberwa, the only unbeaten team in the Gauteng region so far, look set for promotion to the National First Division. Said Seanego: “People were sceptical about my decision to bring the two players to the club. But having witnessed the positive role they play for the entire squad, I am glad I signed them. “We all make mistakes – I couldn’t fold my arms and ignore their plight. They have been tremendous, motivating the young players and ensuring they learn from them. We are building a brand here and I see their contribution at the club taking us places.” Fresh from a successful Alexandra derby clash, where they beat log leaders Alex United 1-0 last Friday, Baberwa have now collected 18 points from eight matches and are a point behind their rivals. “The fact that we are unbeaten with five wins and three draws shows how much we want that promotion. We still have a long way to go but so far, so good. “The Gauteng stream is really tough and competitive, close to five teams are gunning for promotion. But we are ready for the onslaught and determined to prove our worth.” Masuku and Yende’s experience will be vital again on Saturday (3pm) when Baberwa take on struggling Experience Eleven at the Kwa-Thema Stadium. Seanego also praised the South African Football Association for improving the standard of refereeing in the league. The lower division was rocked by scandals of bribery and match-fixing in the past.
