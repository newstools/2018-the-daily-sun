WHEN actor Hungani Ndlovu is not in front of the Camera as the ever plotting and conniving Romeo Medupe in etv’s Scandal!, the star is busy teaching the  youth how to dance. “Every Saturday I teach young people from the ages of 5 and older how to dance. I focus on hip hop, contemporary and ballet,” he said. Speaking to Sun Buzz, the Mpumalanga-born actor said dancing has always been an interest of his from a young age. Said the star: “Right now acting is what keeps me busy, but I actually like both”.  He said   what helps him to be able to juggle his business and work is prioritising. “I make time for the things that I have to do, so I know what come first, but that doesn’t neglect my other responsibilities”, he said. He said he would like in the future to venture into other aspects of show business.  He said: “I would like to get into other spheres of the industry like children’s theatre, stage theatre and also feature films, dramas as well as films.  But also I’m enjoying my current storyline on Scandal! And I hope the writers develop other interesting storylines that challenge it and broaden my scope”. His current storyline has him trying to save the Thebelanga empire from an unscrupulous outsider Mthunzi, who wangled his own in through deceitful means. “Saving the Langa empire is now no longer about Romeo trying to get a piece of the pie, it’s about doing it for the woman he loves, Xolile,” he said.
