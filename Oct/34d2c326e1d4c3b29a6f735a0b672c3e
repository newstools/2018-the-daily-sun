THE South African Revenue Services (SARS) says individual
taxpayers have until the end of Wednesday to file their personal income tax
returns. According to SARS the deadline applies to non-provisional
taxpayers and for provisional taxpayers who opt to file at a branch. However, taxpayers using eFiling have until 31 January 2019
to file their returns. “Taxpayers are encouraged to heed the call and opt for the
eFiling channel to submit their returns. eFiling has experienced 99.7% uptime during Tax Season and
is geared to receive the large volumes of returns that can easily spike to 150
000 submissions daily when Tax Season hits its last two days,” SARS said. The revenue service has reportedly sent reminders to
taxpayers who still need to file. “After the deadline, administrative penalties will be
applied to late returns ranging between R250 and R15 000.” SARS says this year, eighteen taxpayers were prosecuted for
not submitting their tax returns as part of SARS’ outstanding tax return
campaign. “Employers are also reminded that the deadline for submissions
as part of the Employer Interim Reconciliation period also closes on 31 October
2018,” SARS said.
