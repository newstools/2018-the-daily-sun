MASKANDI and mbaqanga fans and musicians are in mourning after Sandile Khwela’s murder on Sunday night. The 45-year-old was well-known in the maskandi scene and won Satma awards in 2012 and 2014. The singer’s two brothers were also seriously wounded in the incident and are in hospital. Family friend and manager Sxhobo Mpungose told Daily Sun Sandile was on his way home to Shongweni, Durban, when he was attacked. “He was going to drop his brothers off at home after they attended a funeral in KwaNdengezi, when two people shot them.” “Sandile died at the scene and his brothers are in a serious condition.” Mpungose said it seemed the attackers wanted to kill all three. Earlier this year, Sandile’s brother’s two teenage sons were shot dead at home. When asked whether the two incidents were linked, Mpungose said: “I believe the people who killed his brother’s sons are those who killed him.” He said Sandile contributed a lot to the industry and was always willing to help other people. The singer will be laid to rest at his home in Shongweni on Saturday. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident. He said Sandile and his brothers were travelling in a BMW. “They lost control and crashed into the gate of a house. They were admitted to hospital, where Sandile died. Police are investigating.”
