MANY families don’t often see eye to eye during funeral preparations, but this family gave mourners a show. Martha Mohlala from Klipgat in North West claimed her two brothers, both of whom are pastors, and their sons beat her. She said the fight started in July after her brother’s wife died. “My nephews accused me of false things,” she said. “They said I shouldn’t attend their mum’s funeral.” Martha said she then told her nephews not to attend her mum’s funeral when she died. “Unfortunately, my mum Isabela Mohlala (85) died on 23 September,” she said. “Before my mum died she had said my nephews shouldn’t attend her funeral.” Martha said she wasn’t happy when she saw her nephews at her mum’s funeral. The service was held at home. “I went to my nephews’ dad and asked him why his kids were at the funeral. He slapped me and I fell. “When my daughter tried to intervene, he shoved her to the ground.” She said the incident happened in front of mourners. “My brother and his kids beat me until I fainted and was taken to hospital. I couldn’t even bury my mum.” Martha’s brother Sunnyboy (65) said his sister was crazy. “They’re the ones who wanted to kill us. “She wanted my kids not to bury their gogo.” He claimed Martha was beaten by residents. Police spokesman Constable Herman Moremi said an assault case was opened. “No one has been arrested.”
