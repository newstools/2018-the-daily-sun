WHEN inyangas were approached by a man selling human body parts, they became worried. The man claimed to be an inyanga from Margate, KZN. The 34-year-old man was seen walking around Manguzi, where he approached traditional healers about the parts. He allegedly told them he had a human hand, a skull and a torso, which were on sale for R4 000. But his mission was disturbed when the concerned inyangas tipped off the police. He was caught and arrested on Sunday. He is expected to appear in court soon. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said cops received information about a man selling human body parts. “Investigations led to Marine Drive in Margate, where the suspect was spotted seated in a car. Cops approached him and requested to search the vehicle.” She said they found a bucket with the body parts cut into pieces inside. “The man confirmed they were indeed human body parts and informed the police that he used them to heal people.” Mbele said police were investigating to see if the suspect could be linked to other crimes in the province. “At this stage, it is not known who the parts belong to. A DNA analysis will determine if they belong to more than one person. “The man has been charged with illegal possession of suspected human body parts,” said Mbele. Thandonjani Hlongwane, chairman of the KZN Traditional Association, said such people should be kept in jail as they were ruining the reputation of good inyangas. “Human body parts don’t heal people. I’m glad the inyangas alerted the police,” said Hlongwane.
