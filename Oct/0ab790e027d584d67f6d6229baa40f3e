GAGASI Dlamini (15) allegedly stole a bag of gold dust from illegal miners and the zama zamas went crazy. On Friday, Gagasi was cornered by the armed miners. They fired several shots at him, but missed. Gagasi tried to run away, but they chased him. He was shot twice and died on the spot. A resident claimed zama zamas had been looking for him since he allegedly stole from them a week ago. “Last week I heard someone say the boy was being hunted by illegal miners. “Now he has been shot,” he said. His mum, Sibongile Dlamini (34), said she hoped her son’s killers would rot in jail. Sibongile said she heard gunshots but didn’t pay attention because shots were fired every day in her community. She ran out of her house when she heard people screaming. “I’m deeply hurt by what happened. This was my only son and he was only 15 years old,” said Sibongile. She said a month ago, Gagasi was stabbed after being accused of stealing someone’s phone. “I told him to stop associating himself with people who were always doing something wrong, but he didn’t listen.” Sibongile said Gagasi was a good child who kept bad company. “He loved to sing. Whenever he felt down, all he did was sing,” said Sibongile. “If he did what they accused him of, they should’ve taken the matter to the police instead of killing a 15-year-old boy.” Sibongile told Daily Sun the disturbing image of her child’s corpse will always be in her mind. She said she hoped the police would find the killers, lock them up and throw away the key. “Seeing my only son bleeding to death was the worst thing I’ve ever been through.” Police spokesman Captain Pheello Mothapo said cops were still looking for the suspects.
