Local music superstar, Thandiswa Mazwai has opened up about missing her “besties”, legendary musicians, Busi Mhlongo and Hugh Masekela. Thandiswa told fans on social media that her life just isn’t the same without her two close friends and she misses them dearly. “My world is very different without them! Both taken by cancer. But I was blessed to have had their love and mentorship. My life has been a dream thanks to them! A young singers dream,” she said. Mam’ Busi died on 15 June 2010 in Durban after a long battle with breast cancer, while Bra Hugh died this year on 23 January 2018 in Johannesburg from prostate cancer. Both of them were close friends and mentors of Thandiswa since she was a young girl. Their music lives on to this day and will forever form part of the fabric of South African culture.
