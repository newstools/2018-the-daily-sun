THE terror of the toy gun thugs came to an end on Tuesday night. Two young men in their early 20s were caught by gatvol residents of Alexandra, east of Joburg. The thugs were caught after robbing a spaza shop owner. They were beaten by the people before being saved by the cops. They are now under police guard in hospital. According to police, residents said the thugs had been robbing people of their cellphones and other valuables with a toy gun. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Malatji told Daily Sun that once the suspects were discharged, an identity parade would be conducted so victims could identify them. “Right now we can’t link them to the crimes they are accused of.” He said they had opened a case of attempted murder against the people who attacked the suspects, and one of attempted business robbery. Captain Malatji warned residents not to take the law into their own hands. In July this year, police opened a murder case after two men were burnt beyond recognition by residents in Alexandra. They were burnt after trying to sell stolen items to the person from whom the items were stolen. Also in July, a man escaped death when he was attacked by residents. He was later arrested for possession of an unlicenced gun.
