Tebogo Lerole and Khanyi Mbau seem to be more in love than ever before. So in love in fact, that Tebogo sees Khanyi Mbau as a “fantasy”, the girl of his dreams. Which is funny, because just nine months ago, the couple fooled the country into thinking that they were so heartbroken over their alleged split which last all of two days. Since the supposed break-up, they have been spotted getting cosy at numerous events all over the country. And now that they are no longer hiding their relationship, or pretending to be broken up, their public displays of affection are increasing by the day. Following Khanyi’s birthday celebration at Sumo night club in Johannesburg last night, Tebogo woke up this morning to gush over the queen of bling. “I so adore everything about you, from your sparkling eyes and gorgeous smile to your tender, loving heart and soul. You are every fantasy I've ever had, rolled up into the loveliest of humans. May your birthday be as extraordinary as you are,” Tebogo said to her. Khanyi turns 33-years-old today. Chunky I so adore everything about you, from your sparkling eyes and gorgeous smile to your tender, loving heart and soul. You are every fantasy I've ever had, rolled up into the loveliest of humans. May your birthday be as extraordinary as you are. _______________________________________ Happy 33rd Birthday Chunky Boo A post shared by  ???? (@edwardbillion) on Oct 15, 2018 at 1:31am PDT
