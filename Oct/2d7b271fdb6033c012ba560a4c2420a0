MAKHOSAZANA Gumede (40) from Sonkombe Village in Ndwedwe, north of Durban desperately needs a house for her family. The mum of six claimed her hisband of 16 years, Zimisele Gumede (71), left them in 2015 to live with another woman. “We used to live in Umzinto but then my husband told me he was moving us to Ndwedwe. He said he would build us a house there,” said Makhosazana. She said her husband asked the local induna to have them in his house with the promise that he would build them a house. But he left forever. Makhosana said after the induna asked them to leave, she used social grant money to build a mud rondavel, where she lives with her kids. She said her husband was a taxi boss on the south coast, but failed to support his kids. “I am able to raise my kids with the social grant money, but I can’t afford to build another room. We sleep and cook in this rondavel.” When the People’s Paper contacted Zimisele, he denied leaving his wife and kids. He said he had no money to build them a house as he was old and no longer working. Asked about the taxis, he said they belonged to his other wife. Ndwedwe mayor Nkosinathi Chili said he would send a team to assess Makhosana’s situation.
