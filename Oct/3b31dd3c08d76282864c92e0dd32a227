A FAMILY from Joburg is worried about their loved one. Aubrey Mothubakgang (22) has been missing since 21 May. To make matters worse, the family is struggling to search for Aubrey because he was on his way to the Eastern Cape when he was last seen. Aubrey left Joburg on 9 February to go and visit his father. His dad lives in Ziphinzana kasi, East London. His sister Dikeledi Mokae (30) said Aubrey’s last known whereabouts were at Kidds beach and Quigney beach in East London. “My brother is mentally disturbed. My mother and I went to East London to search for him, but we couldn’t find him. “We don’t know what happened to him. “My mum and Aubrey’s dad are no longer together. “His dad has since married another woman,” Dikeledi told Daily Sun. “It also makes things difficult to communicate with Aubrey’s father. “We are desperately looking for my brother.” The People’s Paper contacted Aubrey’s father, MacDonald Masiko. He confirmed that his son was still missing. He said he would be grateful if SunReaders would help to look for his son. Police spokeswoman Hazel Mqala confirmed that a case has been opened. “Aubrey hasn’t been found yet,” she said.
