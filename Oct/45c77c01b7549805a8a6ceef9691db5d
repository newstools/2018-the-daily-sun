THE South African bill of rights states that everyone has the right to proper housing, but Dorrick Mogotlane feels she has been robbed of her right. The 46-year-old from Ga-Sekgopo Village outside Modjadjiskloof, Limpopo, says it breaks her heart to see her neighbours living in proper houses while her life is at risk. She said she has applied for an RDP house more than five times, without any success, while those with whom she applied have received houses and are living comfortably. “I don’t know why I’m not getting mine. Whenever I enquire I’m always told I didn’t get a house. I’m living in bad conditions and am slowly losing hope of ever getting a proper house,” she said. Dorrick shares her dilapidated two-roomed house with her six kids and two nieces. She is unemployed so they depend on the child support grant she gets for three kids. “There’s no income except for the social grant. All nine of us are squashed in the house daily. It’s difficult as some of the kids are boys. “It becomes a problem when one has to bath, especially when they’re going to school,” said Dorrick. “Politicians always urge us to vote for them so we can have better lives. Once we vote for them they turn their backs on us. “I no longer see the point of voting.” When the Sun Team visited her, Dorrick was busy making mud bricks to build another room. “I need help of getting a proper house before the house I’m living in collapses,” she said. Co-operative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs spokesman Paena Galane said Dorrick’s details do not appear on the Human Settlements system. “She must go to the Greater Letaba Municipality to apply or check her application. This will mean she is included on the system,” Galane said.
