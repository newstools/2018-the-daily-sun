TRANSPORT Minister Blade Nzimande officially launched the department’s green transport strategy yesterday. The launch in Tshwane formed part of the department’s October Transport Month campaign. Mzimande said Africa had some of the fastest growing economies in the world and had potential as a resource rich continent. “Through this strategy, we aim to promote green mobility to ensure the transport sector supports the economic growth strategy,” he said. The green transport strategy was approved by cabinet in August after a national public consultation process. Nzimande said the launch was also for the department to share its transport plans. “Transport is the driver of socio-economic development. Our carbon footprint continues to grow at a substantial rate,” he said. Nzimande said the strategy aimed to ensure the transport sector was environmentally friendly. He said the industry accounted for 10,8% of Mzansi’s output of greenhouse gases, which cause climate change. At 91,2% most of this comes from road transport. He said as part of promoting green technology vehicles, the department had been working with car manufacturers to promote electric and hybrid vehicles. Nzimande was joined by deputy minister Sindisiwe Chikunga and other representatives of car manufacturers. Chukunga commended the team that worked on the strategy. “I’m proud of the entire team that drafted this. Let’s invest and educate our people about the importance of going green,” she said.
