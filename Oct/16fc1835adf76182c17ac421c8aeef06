WORKING with his compatriot Wedson Nyirenda at Baroka FC is the best thing to have ever happened to Davies Nkausu’s career in South Africa. The former Zambia and SuperSport United defender told SunSport yesterday he’s excited to work with Nyirenda at Baroka. Nkausu joined Bakgaga last week on a one-year contract with an option to renew and is delighted to be working with the 52-year-old. “It is good that I will play again,” said Nkausu. “I have vowed that I will double my efforts in ensuring that the team perform. Nyirenda is a very good coach, and a good example is what he did to the Zambian national team, and in a very short space of time. I am sure that he will do great with Baroka.” Nyirenda signed the 32-year-old to add more experience to their defence. In his 15-year football career in South Africa, Nkausu has won two PSL titles and the Nedbank Cup with Matsatsantsa a Pitori. He has also lifted the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) trophy with Chipolopolo. Said Nkausu: “I have been working hard alone, and I believe I will be ready and fit soon.” Nkausu is also appealing to Baroka fans to be patient with Nyirenda as he is optimistic that the former Kaizer Chiefs striker would turn things around. “Baroka are playing good football and creating many scoring chances. But I fail to understand why we are not scoring,” said Nkausu, who has also played for Bloemfontein Celtic, Free State Stars and National First Division (NFD) side Pretoria University FC. “Baroka need one win and all will be fine.” Thabiso Semenya, formerly with Polokwane City, has also signed for Baroka. The Limpopo-based side will host Golden Arrows in the Telkom Knockout Last 16 at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (3:30pm). That is a week before their next league encounter with Bloemfontein Celtic at the Dr Molemela Stadium on 28 October.
