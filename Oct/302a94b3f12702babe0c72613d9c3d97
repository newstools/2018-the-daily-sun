The end of the school year is coming to an end soon and with that comes matric dance season. This of course gives our local celebs the perfect opportunity to make the dreams of a young fan come true. From Bonang Matheba and Thando Thabethe giving away their red-carpet dresses, to celebrity make-up artists giving away free glam-overs and now Maps chauffeuring a couple to their matric dance, it really is the season to give back. And what’s more, this gives our local celebs another photo-op moment to be seen doing some charitable work. TV star, Masego ‘Maps’ Maponyane has joined the bandwagon of celebs chipping in to make someone’s big matric dance evening a memorable one. Instead of the typical gesture of giving away a suit however, Maps chose to go the extra mile and actually drive a young couple to their matric dance, which obviously caused a huge stir when they all arrived. Maps drove young couple, Lungi Dhladhla and her date to their big night. “Got to chaperone this beautiful Matric Dance couple @lungidhladhla and @ovobuckets to their dance over the weekend, and we had such a good time,” said Maps. “Maps Maponyane Thank you from the bottom of my heart for making our Matric Dance pretty epic. Literally the best night of my young life. P.s You’re the best uber driver that ever lived,” the young male matriculant said to which Maps responded: “This was a beautiful night man. Glad to have been a part of it as your uber driver for your big day Keep dreaming bro, you're destined for big things I hope you know that”.
