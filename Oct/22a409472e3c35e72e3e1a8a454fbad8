GUGU Mahlangu left her home to go and collect clothes from her ex-boyfriend’s house last Thursday. She died of severe burn wounds in hospital the next day! The 42-year-old left her home in Kagiso, Mogale City, with the man after he convinced her she would be safe. Her sister Ntombi said she received a phone call from the man at about 10pm that night telling her to go and see Gugu in hospital. “I felt something die in me after that call. He repeated himself several times to make sure I heard what he was saying,” said Ntombi. When they got to Leratong Hospital, they found Gugu covered in bandages. She had been set alight. Sadly, she died the next day. The suspect was arrested after he went to the hospital to receive treatment for wounds he sustained while allegedly setting Gugu alight. Captain Solomon Sibiya said the man would face murder charges as soon as he was released from hospital. He’s under police guard. Gugu’s mum Jeanette said she wanted justice for her daughter. “That man killed my daughter. We went to the hospital and found her covered in bandages,” she said. “That image will haunt us for the rest of our lives.”
