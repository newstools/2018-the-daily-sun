TAXI drivers want permission to drive in the yellow lane during peak hours. This emerged during a recent meeting between taxi owners, drivers and cops in Sebenza, Ekurhuleni. Some interesting issues were brought up about the working relationship between the parties. Sergeant Sharon Tsotsotso explained the purpose of the meeting was to close the gap between taxi owners, drivers and law enforcement. “We want to bridge the gap by working together and meeting each other’s needs. We want to find solutions to the problems we have,” said Tsotsotso. She said another concern that was raised was the attitude of EMPD women officers towards taxi drivers. “The drivers said female officers have a bad attitude towards them, which often leads to fights,” she said. One taxi driver said that unlike buses, taxis don’t have their own space on the road. “The community depends on us just like they depend on the police. Commuters get upset with us when we are stuck in traffic, complaining they would be late for work or school. “Why can’t there be an exception for our taxis during rush hour in the morning and afternoon?” he asked. But Constable William Molebana of the Edleen precinct was adamant when he said: “If you don’t drive according to the rules of the road, you will be fined. “There is no exception at all for this. The yellow lane is for emergencies only.”
