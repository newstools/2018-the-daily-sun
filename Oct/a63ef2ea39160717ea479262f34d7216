Police in Dobsonville, west of Soweto, have opened two cases of murder following the finding of two decomposed children bodies. The decomposed bodies were found in a veld behind Slovoville cemetery. The bodies were found by a passer-by. Captain Kay Makhubele said the decomposed bodies of the unidentified boy and girl whose ages are estimated around 11 and 10 respectively, were found buried in a single shallow grave, blindfolded, with their hands tied. He said at this stage, no cases of missing children were reported at any of the police stations within Soweto West. “Therefore, the possibility that the children could have been reported missing outside of the Cluster, cannot be ruled out.” Makhubele said. “Police are thus appealing for information from members of the public, especially where people know of two children, a boy and a girl who went missing. This will assist with the identification of the victims and ultimately, the apprehension of the suspects.” He said Meanwhile, in line with the national instruction to prioritise cases against women and children, police will leave no stone unturned to ensure that the perpetrators of this heinous crime against the children, are found to face the full might of the law. Continue to report crime to the Crime Stop number 08600 10111 or to the nearest police station.
