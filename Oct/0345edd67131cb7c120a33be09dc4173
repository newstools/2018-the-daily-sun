A FAMILY is demanding answers following the death of a relative. Mncedisi Rani (68) from New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, died on 14 September while waiting for an ambulance. His daughter Nobathembu Rani (35) said the family was traumatised by the treatment they received at New Brighton Clinic. She said: “My father’s rectum was painful, so I called paramedics and they said we should wait for an ambulance at New Brighton Clinic. “But we received poor service when we got there. “We kept asking about the ambulance, but it didn’t come.” She said the family wanted the ambulance to transfer her father to Dora Nginza or Livingstone Hospital, where specialists could assess him. “The nurses didn’t say anything to us. I also asked them to place him on a drip, but they didn’t. This made his condition worse.” Nobathembu said her father was healthy, but had fallen ill a few weeks before. “We didn’t expect him to die because he was still strong. We got by on his pension grant. I want the nurses responsible for his death to be disciplined because they were very cruel. I also want to know why the ambulance didn’t fetch my dad when we called.” Provincial health spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha said Nobathembu must lay an official complaint so the department can investigate the matter. Sicwetsha said: “The family should report its grievances using the department’s toll-free number. Then we will launch an investigation to find out what happened on the day in question.”
