NOMBEKO’S heartache over losing her son will stay with her forever. But Nombeko Thole (37) said she is grateful that she has been moved from Jerusalema, near Boksburg, east of Joburg, where the memories were haunting her. Her son Richard (5) fell down a mine shaft in February last year. Emergency services and the police tried in vain to retrieve his body. Nombeko was moved to her new home in Cloverdene, Daveyton two weeks ago by the Ekurhuleni Municipality. She said the house is dedicated to the memory of her son. “I’m happy that I moved from there, “ she said. Nombeko said Richard’s friends were always knocking on the door asking when their friend would be removed from the shaft. “Every morning when they went past our yardon the way to creche, they would stop and ask me. It haunted me and I decided to close the door so they would think that I was not there.” Nombeko’s new home has two bedrooms and a bigger yard. The house has a ceiling. They are still waiting for the electricity to be switched on. The house is still empty inside as Nombeko has no furniture. “I hope one day a good Samaritan will donate some sofas to me,” said the unemployed Nombeko. “I thank the municipality for the gift. When it rains, I don’t have to worry about a leaking roof anymore. I sleep peacefully and I sometimes don’t hear the rain because of the ceiling.” She said they often go to the shaft to perform rituals in honour of her son.
