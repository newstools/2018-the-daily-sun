Some residents of Westbury asked for the soldiers to fight thugs in their area during the protest against crime. On Tuesday, police minister Bheki Cele promised residents he
would send Amaberete during his visit in the area following the protest. Now shortly after the minister deployed Amaberethe, a military
chopper was seen hovering over Westbury on Thursday. It is not yet clear if the soldiers have been deployed to
fight crime in the area as well.
