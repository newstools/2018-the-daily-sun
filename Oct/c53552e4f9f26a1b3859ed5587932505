FAMILIES experience difficulty when death strikes – funeral costs are very high! That’s why families who couldn’t afford graves sold by the municipality buried their loved ones at Congo cemetery. But the families from Inanda, north of Durban, are unhappy after hearing their families will be exhumed. Apparently, the burials have been declared illegal. A councillor confirmed this after Daily Sun contacted him for comment. The People’s Paper phoned him after kak spilled over a grave at the illegal cemetery. The person buried there will apparently be reburied at a municipal cemetery. Upset residents said exhuming their loved one’s bodies would disturb their peaceful, eternal sleep. They have using the Congo cemetery since 2013. Cebisile Dlamini’s brother lies buried at the cemetery. She said the family wanted him to be reburied at the same cemetery, near his home. “My brother is resting in peace, and moving him will cause problems for us,” said Cebisile (31). “He told me he wanted to be buried there. Moving him would be against his wishes.” Sipho Mhlongo (50) said the land had fallen into disuse, and that was why they buried their loved ones there. Councillor Vusi Gebashe said residents were warned against burying their loved ones there. But they had continued, apparently because they could not afford the legal cemeteries run by the municipality. “But what needs to be done will be done. “They will be taught about it and will understand,” said Gebashe.
