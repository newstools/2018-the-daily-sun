Former Durban Councillor and convicted fraudster Kessie Nair
has been denied bail by the Verulam Magistrates Court. Nair was arrested for calling President Cyril Ramaphosa a 'K****R' over a month ago in a viral video. A case was opened after the video of Nair calling the
president the a 'K****R', went viral and outraged people of Mzansi. Following that, Nair issued an apology to Ramaphosa saying: “I
want to publicly apologise to President Cyril Ramaphosa and the nation.” He said he should have used a word other than the “k” word,
but he had used it because he was “emotional”. Nair was arrested at his home on charges of crimen injuria
and incitement of public violence. In the video, Nair said that he was prepared to take a
bullet or go to prison for the rest of his life. In his previous court appearance, it emerged that Nair was
taken to Mahatma Gandhi Hospital for a mental health assessment.
