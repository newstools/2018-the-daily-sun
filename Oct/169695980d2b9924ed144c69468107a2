Renowned DJ, Themba ‘Euphonik’ Nkosi is once again throwing his one-of-a-kind bash that is reserved exclusively for VIPs. The radio and club DJ launched VIPs Only in 2017 and he is planning on taking the event to greater heights this year. As the name suggests, VIPs Only is exclusively an invite-only event aimed at celebrating the music and party scene in Mzansi. This year’s installment will be a daytime event with a host of SA’s best musical talents all at a secret location. The first VIPs Only was hosted at the trendy Rockets in Bryanson, north of Johannesburg, followed by another one at the upmarket and very fancy Sands in Sandton, then Jamie’s Italian in Merlrose Arch, followed by Khoi in Menlyn Maine, Tshwane. “I love performing and partying all around the world; from Miami to Ibiza but there’s no place like home. It’s always great seeing people have a good time and appreciate music,” said Euphonik. Where will the next one be held? Only time will tell. But we do know that the next installment will take place on Sunday. 28 October and you can get yourself on the guest list in the meantime.
