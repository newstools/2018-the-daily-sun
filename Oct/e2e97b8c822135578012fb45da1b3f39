THEY don’t just steal from the shack, they take the whole mkhukhu! Providence Tshweni (28) from Orange Farm, south of Joburg said he came back from work and his mkhukhu was gone – and this is not the first time! It first happened last year and again last month. “I came back from work and my mkhukhu was gone. One of my neighbours was at work and the other one was at the mall. Nobody saw a thing,” said Providence. Jabulani Khoza (30) said the thieves came during the day. “When you come back from work, your mkhukhu is gone,” said Jabulani. “And it’s not just the shack they take. They also take everything inside.” His mkhukhu was stolen in January, only a few days after he built it. A few days later, his neighbour was robbed in the same way. “We are tired of these thieves. We’ll end up taking the law into our own hands because we can’t work to make other people rich,” said Jabulani. Lejone Bosina (34) has also lost two mkhukhus and now she’s afraid of being away from home. Community leader Nokuthula Mafanya (35) said a lot of people had been complaining. “We’re tired of this abuse. People are now threatening to take the law into their own hands because nothing is being done about these thieves. Some even suspect their neighbours,” said Nokuthula. Captain Thembeka Koagoe said Orange Farm cops weren’t aware that mkhukhus were being stolen. According to the police, shacks that are left empty for too long are removed by the kasi committee. The police said they would look into the matter.
