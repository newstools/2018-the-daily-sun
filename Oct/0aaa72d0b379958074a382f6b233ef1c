NTOKOZO Dlamini seems to have a lot to celebrate. The actor recently became a father of a baby girl and, according to rumours, he’ll be returning to the SABC1 soapie Uzalo. Ntokozo plays Mastermind, who’s currently in prison. There were rumours he had been suspended for misbehaving. He recently spoke to a KZN radio station and said he was not fired or suspended but took a break to spend time with his baby. According to a source who works on Uzalo, Ntokozo was suspended but will be returning soon. “The producers felt he was not respectful,” said the source. “He’d come to set late and not apologise. But he’s coming back soon.” Another source said the soapie had been pressured by viewers to bring him back. Marang Setshwaelo, a spokeswoman for Uzalo, said: “We can confirm that TK Dlamini, also known as Mastermind, will be appearing on Uzalo in the near future. “But we’d like to make it clear that he was never dismissed or suspended.”
