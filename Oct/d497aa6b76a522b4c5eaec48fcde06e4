THE Zwanes are pleading with SunReaders to help them find their uncle. Eliot Zwane (58) went missing on Saturday at the Rondebult Cemetery in Dawn Park, Boksburg, after attending a relative’s funeral. Bheki Zwane (41) said Eliot came to Villa Liza last Monday from Ermelo in Mpumalanga to help with the funeral arrangements. Bheki said he was standing next to his uncle at the cemetery during the service. When the service ended, Eliot said he was going to find the taxi he had travelled in from home. “That was the last time I saw him. We realised he wasn’t around when I asked my niece to dish up for him,” he said. Bheki said on realising his uncle was not around, he told other family members and they searched for him. They also searched for Eliot in Vosloorus at the homes of three relatives who were also burying their loved ones on Saturday. The Zwanes believe Eliot took the wrong taxi at the cemetery. “We couldn’t sleep that night. It’s hard for all of us,” said Bheki. He said this was not the first time his uncle had gone missing. Eliot once went missing last year at a funeral in Mpumalanga. But they were able to find him because they realised early that he was not around. “He’s forgetful. I don’t know whether someone took him or if he wandered on his own,” said Bheki. “We’re asking for anyone who might know where he is to help us find him.” A missing person’s case was opened at Dawn Park Police Station.
