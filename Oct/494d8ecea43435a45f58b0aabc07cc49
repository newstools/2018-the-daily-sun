YESTERDAY, protest action carried on in Grabouw for the second day. Protesters vowed they won’t stop until a cow is slaughtered for the official opening of a new multimillion school. People said they were not consulted when the principal moved pupils from prefab structures to the new school on Wednesday. Project steering committee chairman Odwa Simela said there must be an official handover. “We had a meeting and the resolution was no one would be moving to the school until we had an official handover but the principal ignored all that.” He also said the school was not yet complete but the principal was rushing everything. “We want a financial report which details how much was used and how much is left. “The SGB has been active for 10 years. We want to elect a new one and the principal must go.” Parents say their kids were traumatised on Wednesday. Nthabiseng Bewana asked: “This is all because a cow was not slaughtered. The people who are protesting don’t even have children here at the school. “The official opening will be organised at a later stage. They must not disrupt our children.” Yesterday, parents walked to school with their kids and there was a heavy police presence in the area. Protesters gathering under the eye of the police tried to stop pupils from entering the school but were unsuccessful. They started burning rubble on the N2 and throwing stones, resulting in the road closure. Councillor Toto Siphunzi said he was not consulted about the move. “I was only consulted when the protest started and am worried because people might damage the new school.” Traffic Chief Kenny Afrika said: “The N2 between Grabouw and Blikkiesdorp is closed in both directions due to stone throwing and protest action.”
