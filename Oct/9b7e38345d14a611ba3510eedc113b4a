A ZOO is in mourning after one of its rare white tigers
attacked and killed a zookeeper. According to Japan Times, Akira Furusho (40) was found
lying on the tiger’s cage’s floor with his neck ripped apart on Tuesday afternoon
at the Hirakawa Zoological Park in Kagoshima in the south of Japan. Colleagues rushed Akira to hospital but doctors could
only confirm that he was dead. The killer tiger was born in the zoo five years ago and
is called Riku. The tiger is about 1,8 meters in length and weighs about 170
kilograms. White tigers are very rare and are related to the more
common Bengal tiger. They have black stripes and white fur. A vet used a tranquillizer gun to sedate Riku and his
cage has been temporarily closed to visitors. Cops and labour authorities are investigating how the
tragedy happened. The zoo’s rules forbid a keeper from entering the display
cage where the tiger spends the day before the dangerous cat has been moved
into its sleeping chamber. Akira was found mortally wounded in Riku’s display cage. The zoo was opened in 1972. This is the first such
tragedy it has suffered.
