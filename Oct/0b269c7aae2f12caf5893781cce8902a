THULASIZWE Buthelezi’s political future is hanging in the balance. The Zululand mayor is accused of not following the IFP’s instructions and has been summoned to appear before the party’s political oversight committee today to explain himself. Last week, he apparently ignored co-operative governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube’s warning not to fill the position of municipal manager. This angered the IFP, which wrote him a letter. The letter, which Daily Sun has seen, is dated 22 October and instructs the mayor not to fill any position until he has appeared before the committee. But the People’s Paper was told by a reliable source that the mayor ordered officials to conduct interviews on Wednesday. The source claimed the mayor wanted to hire acting municipal manager Mpumelelo Manqele. Last week, the MEC wrote a letter to the municipality asking for the mayor to be investigated for attending a tender briefing. IFP spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa confirmed the mayor had been called to appear before the committee. IFP whip in the municipality, Bheki Mncwango, confirmed the MEC had sent a letter asking for the mayor to be investigated. The mayor didn’t respond to questions sent.
