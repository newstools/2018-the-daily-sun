Beauty queen, business woman and former Miss SA first princess, Boipelo Mabe has launched her very own skincare range. She launched the My African Skincare Body Range by Boipelo Mabe this past Saturday on her 25th birthday in Johannesburg. The range is in partnership with local vegan skincare brand, My Skincare Unveiled. My Skincare Unveiled, which produces organic products, is a company owned by Haley Rieckhoff who founded the brand after finishing her Cosmetology studies in 2004.  Boipelo’s range is made up of body butters and scrubs which are infused with natural oils sourced from around Africa. “I am so proud to have partnered with a business that has a deep regard for people, our continent and the environment that sustains us. More than anything, this is a step towards disproving the notion that Africans consume what they don’t produce,” said Boipelo. The oils used in the range include: Organic Baobab Oil (South Africa), Organic Mafura Butter (Mozambique), Organic Shea Butter (Ghana), Organic Coconut Oil (Mozambique), Cold Pressed Moringa Oil (South Africa), Cold Pressed Mongongo Oil (Namibia), Organic Marula Oil (South Africa), Cold Pressed Hemp Seed Oil (South Africa), Extra Virgin Olive Oil (South Africa), and Cold Pressed Macadamia Oil (South Africa). Fans should look out for the My African Butter Lemon that is infused with lemon and vanilla fragrances as well as the My African Butter Delight which is infused with Sandalwood, Rose and Vanilla essential oils.

All products from the My African Butter and Scrub range will be available to purchase online and at selected boutique salons in and around Johannesburg soon.
