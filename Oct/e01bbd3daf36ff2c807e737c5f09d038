TWO Nigerian men have been bust for hiding drugs in vegetables and now street traders are worried their businesses might suffer. This after cops found 248 Mandrax tablets hidden among potatoes in Upington on Sunday night. Mpho Sebotsa (33) from Upington, Northern Cape, said: “Our customers will be afraid to buy vegetables from the streets after this. “I’ve been selling fruit and vegetables to make a living since I finished high school in 2003. I hope these foolish men rot in jail.” Police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Dimakatso Mooi said the men were selling tomatoes and potatoes when they were spotted by cops. “The members were conducting stop and search operations when they noticed two men who seemed to be worried about the police at a hitchhiking spot on the N14. “One of them threw a bag on the ground and started to run away. The suspect was caught and closer inspection revealed there were Mandrax tablets in the potato bag.” Mooi said the tablets had a street value of about R25 000. They were confiscated and the two men, aged 35 and 36, were bust. A Nokia cellphone suspected to have been stolen during a housebreaking was also confiscated. “They will appear before the Upington Magistrates Court soon for dealing in drugs and possession of suspected stolen property.”
