PAULA Abdul, star singer of the Opposites Attract, must
be counting her blessings after falling off stage during a performance but
surviving totally unscratched. According to the Sun, the 56-year-oldâ€™s embarrassing tumble
took place while she was singing The Promise of a New Day in Mississippi over
the weekend. She simply climbed back up and continued with the show.
