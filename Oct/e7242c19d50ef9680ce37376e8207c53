GOGO Eunice Moseki (58) carries a broom everywhere she goes. She looks for dirty yards and asks to sweep them for a reasonable fee, with which she buys food. But her unique business landed her in trouble two weeks ago when she was found sleeping inside an outside toilet, the broom in hand. Eunice from Bekkersdal, near Westonaria in Rand West City, apparently stepped into a stranger’s toilet to pee but fell asleep. She was too tired. When the owner of the toilet opened the door she found her there, sleeping and with one hand holding the broom. Residents were called and they beat her. She was rescued by Simon Mfundisi, a resident who knows her. He assured residents gogo was not evil. “Gogo goes around with the broom looking for jobs,” Mfundisi told the mob which had gathered around gogo. And that’s how gogo’s life was spared. “I’m still in pain. I don’t know what would have happened if Mfundisi hadn’t come to my rescue,” she said. She also cleans at a local church, whose elders Muziwenkosi Ntenga and David Mhlongo confirmed this. Eunice said she wanted to open a case but knew cops would tell her to point out her attackers. “There were many people and it’s difficult to tell who they were,” said the gogo. “I just want people to stop dragging my name through the mud. I’m not evil!” Sergeant Linkie Lefakane advised gogo to come to lay a charge, whether she knows the culprits or not.
