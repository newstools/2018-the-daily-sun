Singer and songwriter, Tshiamo Dube, who goes by the name Tsitsi is taking her career to the next level. The 13-year-old musician, who is from Port Elizabeth but based in Durban has released her new single, Soar. Already making her mark in the music industry, the young musician is using the song to console and encourage those who have disappointed their loved ones to pick themselves up and celebrate themselves. It is a pop song with an up-tempo beat that was inspired by former Jamali member, Mariechan, international musicians Dua Lipa and Alessia Cara as well as her wonderful family. “There is so much pressure to be perfect, to please people. Soar is a reminder that things will work out and we will soar and rise above and beyond the expectations of others. It is a song about overcoming and being a better version of yourself, I want young boys and girls to feel encouraged and know they are enough,” she said in a statement. More than just a singer, Tsitsi is also a guitar player and forms part of a Marimba band in Durban. She is passionate about storytelling and wants to use her voice to inspire people. Tsitsi also wants to educate young people about the power of investing in their futures, financial responsibility and the relentless pursuit of dreams. “I’ve always had an appreciation for music and the way that it can make you feel, the magical experience you can acquire from listen to an emotional song is amazing. This is the special connection that I want to share with everyone through music,” she continued. Soar is available for download on iTunes and Spotify.
