TWO men were arrested after being caught with perlemoen on Tuesday. The men were driving an Iveco minibus when Free State cops stopped them for having illegal passengers. It was then discovered that the vehicle was also transporting perlemoen. Police spokeswoman Constable Wendy Nkabi said the two men were from the Western Cape but heading to Gauteng. They were travelling along the N1 between Tierpoort and Bloemfontein “On Tuesday at about 6.30am, the K9 unit was doing a normal patrol when they stopped the suspicious vehicle. “During the search, they discovered about 30 plastic bags containing a large quantity of perlemoen hidden under the seats and in the boot,” said Nkabi. “A 33-year-old suspect managed to flee on foot but he was caught by a police dog. “Two suspects, aged 33 and 35, were arrested on the scene and detained at Bainsvlei Police Station. “The perlemoen, with an estimated value of about R1,18 million, was confiscated. The two men were charged with illegal possession of abalone without valid documentation.” The suspects will appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court soon.
