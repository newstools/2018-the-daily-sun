ETHIOPIAN lawmakers on Thursday unanimously elected the
country's first female president, days after approving one of the world's few
"gender-balanced" Cabinets. Seasoned diplomat Sahle-Work Zewde succeeds Mulatu
Teshome in the largely ceremonial post. "In a patriarchal society such as ours, the
appointment of a female head of state not only sets the standard for the future
but also normalises women as decision-makers in public life," the chief of
staff for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said in a Twitter post. Sahle-Work called Ethiopia's recent transfer of power to
the reformist prime minister "exemplary" and said she will focus on
bringing together all sides to achieve peace in a country with multiple
ethnic-based conflicts in recent months. Ethiopian lawmakers last week approved a new Cabinet with
a record 50% female ministers, including the country's first woman defence
minister. The moves are the latest in sweeping political and
economic reforms in Africa's second most populous country since Abiy took
office in April following months of nationwide anti-government protests
demanding wider freedoms. Sahle-Work has worked within various United Nations
organs and was the first director-general of the UN office in Nairobi. Until recently she was the UN secretary general's special
representative to the African Union.  https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/pics-ethiopia-elects-1st-female-president-sets-the-standard-20181025
