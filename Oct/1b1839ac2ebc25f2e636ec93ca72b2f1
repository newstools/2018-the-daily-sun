THIS madala from Islington in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga said a thief stole R1 700 meant to feed his family. The 66-year-old said this came to light last week when he went to Thulamahashe Shopping Mall to withdraw his grant money, using his old Sassa card. But when he arrived at the mall, the ATM wouldn’t cough up a cent. Madala Herold Mzimba rushed to the Post Office to find out why. He said officials said the system showed that his money had been withdrawn in KZN by someone using his personal information. “I became suspicious when my cellphone didn’t receive a notification for the payment from Sassa, as it normally does. “Officials at the Post Office and at the Sassa office in Thulamahashe said the system showed that the person was using my details and withdrew the money from my account in KZN, using the new Sassa card. “They advised me to open a case with the police. I have two wives and seven children. “I don’t know what am I going to feed my family this whole month,” said the madala. Sassa Mpumalanga spokesman Senzeni Ngubeni said they were concerned about the suffering of the beneficiary. “Sassa will thoroughly investigate the matter and ensure that everything returns to normal as soon as possible,” said Ngubeni. Sergeant Abigail Nxumalo confirmed a case of fraud was opened.
