A MAN who pretended to have died turned himself in the
day after the dead bodies of his wife and two kids were found. According to the Guardian, the desperate husband, known
only by his surname, “He”, faked his death on 19 September by driving a rented
car into a river in Hunan province, China. Debt had driven him to despair. He owed more than 100 000
Yuan (about R208 000) to online mashonisa. His plan was to secure an insurance payout for his family
by faking his death. But his wife, named only by her surname, “Dai”, didn’t
know her husband was still alive and planning to be reunited with his family
when he felt safe he wouldn’t be bust for fraud. Three weeks after He’s disappearance, Dai posted on
social media that she was going to kill herself and her kids to “reunite her
family”. “I wanted to leave alone, but without their parents, my
son and daughter will be in pain and will be bullied like me,” she wrote. Soon after, she drowned herself and her two kids. In a video filmed after handing himself in, He said: “My
daughter, who is ill, has to get medical checks every month. I have to pay off
car loans, and our family expenses. I’m also sick. I did this to avoid debts. “I never thought my wife would be so infatuated with me.” The tragedy has unleashed some intense soul searching in
China about the treatment and opportunities of Chinese women, especially those
who are poor and live in rural areas. China is one of the few countries in the world where
suicide rates are higher among women than men. He is being held on suspicion of destruction of property
and insurance fraud.
