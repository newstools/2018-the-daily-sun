ROADS from Rustenburg to Kroondal, North West were barricaded with logs, burning tyres and steel barriers on Tuesday. The residents of Ikemeleng squatter camp want their councillor to go. They vowed that not a single voting station would be erected in the area if Councillor Virginia Nqanqeni remained. They said for three years they have struggled with basic services such as water and housing. The residents claimed they only had water at night. They also accused the councillor of selling municipal jobs and giving tenders to her favourites. “We don’t want this woman anymore because she rules by her own laws. We have tried talking to her, but we get arrested for intimidation. “During our last meeting, she wrote a list of names down at the meeting and reported those people to the police, saying they had intimidated her,” claimed one resident. Four people were arrested and are out on bail. They will appear in the Rustenburg Magistrates Court on 8 November. The residents were dispersed with rubber bullets, but they maintained they won’t stop until the councillor has gone. Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani of North West police said there were no arrests. Rustenburg municipal spokesman David Magae said the councillor in question explained that the unrest in the area was caused by allegations, which are yet to be proven. He said the matter was still being investigated.
