TIMOTHY Omotoso’s lawyers are not giving up in their fight to force Judge Mandela Makaula to recuse himself from the trial. The pastor’s lawyers have said they want to go to the Supreme Court of Appeal to force Port Elizabeth High Court Judge Makaula to hand the trial over to someone else. On Monday Makaula dismissed an application by Omotoso’s defence lawyer, Peter Daubermann, to recuse himself from the case. Dauberman said his clients felt that the judge had clearly sided with state witness Cheryl Zondi when he excused her from the stand to write her university exams. Daubermann yesterday instructed Advocate Terry Price to bring an application for leave to appeal against Monday’s ruling. The judge yesterday said he had dismissed the application because rape witnesses had to be treated with respect. “The perception that the applicants will not receive a fair trial is baseless and ridiculous,” he said. Omotoso and his co-accused, Lusanda Sulani (36) and Zukiswa Sitho (28), are facing 97 charges including rape, sexual assault and human trafficking. The case was postponed to Tuesday for the court to deliver judgment.
