FOUR young men who stabbed a man (30) to death in front of his girlfriend were bust a few hours after the incident. The stabbing took place in Ramotse Village near Temba, Tshwane on Sunday night. The victim and his girlfriend were walking home when they were attacked. Cops said the suspects were arrested in the early hours of Monday morning in nearby Kekana Gardens kasi. Police spokesman Constable Herman Moremi said: “The victims came across four boys aged between 16 and 17. “They produced two knives and started robbing them. They took cellphones from the dead man before stabbing him several times in the upper body. They then fled the scene.” Moremi said the suspects were indentified by the dead man’s girlfriend. The suspects will appear in the Moretele Magistrates Court soon to face charges of murder and robbery.
