IN DEATH threats sent by SMS, municipal manager Bongiwe
Mnikathi was told she would die before 8 October. The day has come and gone and Mnikathi has survived the
death threats. But she was suspended on Monday after abandoning her duties and
failing to attend meetings. The town council said her actions were in breach of her
contract. Municipal speaker Samora Ndlovu said: “She doesn’t comply
with council meeting rules and the decision to suspend her was made to make
sure the municipality continues with its work.” Ndlovu said Mnikathi was not suspended for the maladministration
and corruption cases postponed to 8November. She was still going to face prosecution if found guilty. Mnikathi took over from Sibusiso Sithole last August, after
Sithole was murdered in March. Last week Daily Sun reported that Mnikathi had received
death threats for investigating certain projects. In the SMS she received, the sender told her she wouldn’t
live to see 8 October if she didn’t vacate her position or stop interfering in
projects. When the SunTeam contacted Mnikathi to confirm her
suspension, she said: “I can’t comment on the matter for now.”
