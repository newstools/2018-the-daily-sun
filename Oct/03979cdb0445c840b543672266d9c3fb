NEW mums, nurses and guards have been urged to stay vigilant. Child and human trafficking syndicates are now apparently targeting maternity wards! Two unknown men tried to abduct newborns at Addington Hospital in Durban recently. The two men, who had health department name tags, gained access to the maternity ward and told nurses they were collecting mums and newborns for birth certificate registration. The department ideally registers all births within the first 30 days. Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo confirmed to Daily Sun the suspects pretended to be department staff. But an alert nursing sister refused to release the mums and babies and the men left shortly afterwards. “This incident is concerning and has all the makings of attempted human trafficking,” said Dhlomo. He said his department, in partnership with Home Affairs, ran an online birth certificate registration system to ensure all children born at major hospitals had birth certificates when their mums were discharged. “This programme was launched by the minister of home affairs at Addington Hospital in 2014, so mothers don’t need anyone to help them in this regard.” He said they were grateful to the nursing sister. “We urge all security personnel, nursing staff and mothers themselves at all our healthcare facilities to be extra vigilant because it’s clear there are unscrupulous people who’re out to cause mayhem,” said Dhlomo.
