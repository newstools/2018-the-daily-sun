AFTER stealing from an innocent victim’s house, the thugs loaded their loot into his bakkie. But the Chevrolet had a tracker and cops soon caught up with them. Metro cops were horrified when they traced the vehicle to a house in Dalpark ext 6 in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, which belongs to a cop. When questioned, the 26-year-old cop claimed his friend had contacted him asking if he could park his work bakkie at his house. The Metro cops didn’t buy his story and the cop based at Boksburg Police Station was arrested on the spot. Metro police spokesman Clifford Shongwe said the bakkie was stolen from Petit in Benoni on Friday while the owner was asleep. “His house was broken into and criminals stole various electronic devices and other valuables such as a flat screen TV. “These criminals then loaded the loot into his bakkie and sped away,” he said. “According to the car tracking company, the vehicle first went to Wadeville, where they could have offloaded the stolen items before driving to a police officer’s house.” The cop claimed he was asleep at his house when his friend called him on his cellphone at about 10pm. “The owner of the bakkie noticed his belongings were missing when he woke up at about 5am,” said Shongwe. “He alerted the car tracking company and the Metro cops. The SAPS officer was arrested for being in possession of a stolen vehicle. Police are doing their best to track the victim’s missing belongings.” The suspect was taken to Brakpan cop shop and appeared in the local magistrates court yesterday. His case was postponed to Friday.
