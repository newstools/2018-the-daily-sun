Fed up residents have taken the law into their own hands in an attempt to get rid of crime in their area. Hundreds of angry residents in the Kasi of Sicelo in Mayerton raided and destroyed several shacks in a manhunt for criminals. This is following the death of no less than six women in the area in recent months. In the last five months, six women have been raped and strangled to death with their bodies dumped in the bushes by an alleged serial killer. Feeling let down by authorities, community leaders and residents took matters into their own hands - raiding crime hotspots in the Kasi hoping to nab not only the alleged serial rapist and killer but also other known drug dealers and illegal tarven owners. The destroyed shacks are believed by residents to be crime havens in the kasi. Investigations are ongoing in all the murders with no suspects arrested thus far.
