LIFE is hard for the Cele family from Tweedie near Howick, in the KZN Midlands. The poor family of five live in a crumbling mud house that may collapse at any time. The family told Daily Sun their four-roomed home was damaged by heavy rain a few years back. They were forced to share a room which wasn’t damaged. The family said the room leaks when it’s raining and the house may fall on them at any time. Nkehli Cele (47) said she and her brother, France (60), inherited the house from their late parents. “We live with my daughter (28) and my two grandkids. I’m unemployed and my daughter is also jobless. My brother survives on piece jobs. The money he makes and the kids’ grants help to put food on the table,” said Nkehli. “We don’t have money to build a proper house.” She said every time it rains, life becomes a living hell for them. “Life is hard for us. We don’t have water or electricity. We don’t know what to do because we have nowhere to go.” Nkehli’s brother applied for an RDP 10 years ago, but he is still waiting for the house. “Other people were given RDPs, but we were left behind. All we need is an RDP. I spoke to the councillor and he told me there was nothing he could do.” Councillor Mzo Ndlovu said he was aware of the family’s situation. He said he had spoken to municipal officials about the matter. “When RDPs were built in the area, we discovered that the land didn’t belong to the Cele family but to a farmer who died years ago. “The municipality can’t build a house on someone’s land. We are in the process of finding land for the family so we can build them an RDP,” said Ndlovu.
