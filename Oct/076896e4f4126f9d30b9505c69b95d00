COPS say they are gatvol of sharing their station with cows. The police at Putfontein Police Station near Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun there was a grazing patch behind the station and cows were coming into the cop shop’s yard through a hole in the fence. Residents living nearby said they often saw the cows wandering around the police station’s premises. CPF leader Gerald van Sevender said: “Our police station is neglected. It has not been renovated as often as other police stations in nearby areas.” Van Sevender said the police station had looked the same for 37 years. “The fence is full of holes and the cells are not usable. Our cops are doing well, but they are not getting the credit they deserve. “We don’t know what is going on. “We don’t know how long our police station will be like this. “Our cops are not safe because thugs can enter through the same hole in the fence that the cows use,” said Van Sevender. Resident Jan Moeng said cops had to take suspects to other police stations because they could not use the holding cells. Police station spokesman Constable Justice Ramaube said the holding cells were still under construction. Department of Public Works spokesman Thami Mchunu said they would see what they could do to help.
