MEMBERS of Marikana Neighbourhood Watch in Philippi, Cape Town are angry. Xolani Thukwayo, chairman of the neighbourhood watch, said Safety MEC Dan Plato was making their lives difficult. “When we started patrolling last year, we were promised uniforms, two-way radios and other things. But we are still waiting. It’s difficult to communicate with other members without radios,” Xolani said. There were are rumours that neighbourhood watch members had stopped working because they wanted to be paid. “That’s not true. We are still working because crime in our area is high,” said Xolani. Marikana resident Zukile Gam (47) said the neighbourhood watch would never win the battle against criminals. “The problem is that the criminals in this area have guns. People are being robbed almost every day. We don’t expect neighbourhood watch members to risk their lives by tackling armed criminals.” Another resident, Nosipho Mfene (38), said she happy with the neighbourhood watch. “If it wasn’t for them, things would be worse. We just hope that they’ll be given the necessary equipment to tackle criminals,” said Nosipho. Ewald Botha, a spokesman for MEC Plato, said: “The MEC is aware of the complaints and requests for assistance with bibs and two-way radios. “Even though the neighbourhood watch is doing a good job, the members are not officially accredited. This makes it difficult for the department to support them. “But the MEC has requested the department to look into their accreditation status to see how we can assist.”
