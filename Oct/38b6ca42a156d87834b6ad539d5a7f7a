Koketso Kgwadi (23) was stabbed to death in December. His mother, Hlokomelo Kgwadi (43), put her faith in the police and indeed a suspect was arrested. But she now feels the law has let her down because the suspect was released on bail. Koketso was killed at a birthday party and the suspect allegedly ran away from a mob when he realised he was in trouble. Hlokomelo, from Mamehlabe Village in Matlala, Limpopo, said she was relieved when the suspect was bust. “All I want is justice for my son. The suspect can’t roam the streets while my son is dead. This is an injustice.” On Friday, Hlokomelo and other community members went to the Matlala Magistrates Court, where the suspect was appearing. “I’m not happy with the way this case is being handled. The detective in charge of the case never came to update me on his investigations. When we arrived at court, I was denied access until I went to the station commander. “It seems the suspect is now a victim and getting better treatment from this court than me.” Hlokomelo said the suspect should have not been granted bail because other people’s lives are in danger. The suspect is still out on bail and the case was postponed to 30 November.
