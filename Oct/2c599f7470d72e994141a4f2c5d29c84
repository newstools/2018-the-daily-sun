MZANSI might get a new minister of finance soon. This is if president Cyril Ramaphosa decides to fire Nhlanhla
Nene. Opposition parties have been calling for Nene's head since
he confirmed that he has been to the Gupta mansion in Saxonworld five times. Nhlanhla Nene was appointed finance minister by former
president Jacob Zuma on 25 May
2014 and was replaced with David van Rooyen on 9 December 2015. Des van Rooyen, whom social media called "a weekend special" lasted only 3 days on the job.  Jacob Zuma replaced him with Pravin Gordhan on 13
December 2015 after intense pressure from the society and opposition parties.  Zuma then fired Gordan and replaced him with Malusi Gigaba
on 31 March 2017.  Gigaba was removed from the post by Ramaphosa earlier this
year. He put back Nene in his place. Now it seems Nene will soon become a former finance minister. This on the back of his appearance before the commission of
inquiry into state capture last week, during which he confirmed visiting the
Gupta family on numerous occasions between 2009 and 2014. Ramaphosa said he is concerned about the uncertainty being created
in the financial markets around the fate of Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene. The president's spokesperson Khusela Diko said on Tuesday
that Ramaphosa would make an announcement on Nene's fate "soon".
