PARLIAMENT’S joint ethics committee will investigate EFF chief whip and deputy president Floyd Shivambu’s alleged involvement in the VBS Mutual Bank scandal. This comes after the Reserve Bank released a report last week in which it was alleged that Floyd’s brother Brian had received millions from VBS. The DA’s Phumzile van Damme laid a complaint against Floyd. In a letter to the DA, acting registrar of members’ interests, Advocate Anthea Gordon confirmed the matter was being attended to. Van Damme called on the Hawks to investigate Floyd and asked for him to undergo a lifestyle audit. The report compiled by Advocate Terry Motau alleged that Brian received R16 million from the bank. A day later, Daily Maverick reported that R10 million of that money had been given to Floyd and R1,33 million to the EFF. On Tuesday, EFF leader Julius Malema claimed that a Sars rogue unit led by Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan was on a campaign to discredit the party. However, he acknowledged there had been bank transfers between the brothers. Meanwhile, the South African Council of Churches in Limpopo has warned local churches not to provide a platform to anyone accused of wrongdoing in the report. At a press briefing in Polokwane yesterday, the council announced it would hold a prayer service for the bank and employees. The session will take place on 1 November at the VBS Bank building in Thohoyandou.
