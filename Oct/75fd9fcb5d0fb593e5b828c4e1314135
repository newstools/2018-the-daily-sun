The island nation hosts South Africa at the Linte Stadium in the capital of Victoria on Tuesday afternoon. Baxter's charges handed the Seychelles a 6-0 defeat at FNB Stadium on Saturday and will be hoping to better their chances of Africa Cup of Nations qualifications with a victory.

Meanwhile, Thulani Hlatshwayo and Buhle Mkhwanazi will hold the defensive fort intact with Ramahlwe Mphahlele and Sifiso Hlanti keeping their place on either flanks. Percy Tau and Lebo Mothiba will lead the attack alongside Ndlovu with Aubrey Modiba falling to the bench. Kick-off is at 3:30pm (SA time).
