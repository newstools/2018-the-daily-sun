NONKANYISO Conco believes everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The 24-year-old made headlines last year when her relationship with former president Jacob Zuma was made public. She was bashed for being in love with a much older man. But that didn’t make her give up on her dream of empowering women from all walks of life. Her fighting spirit has landed her a show on KZN-based radio station Vuma FM. Nonkanyiso’s show Women in Conversation with LaConco, airs every Wednesday between 7pm and 8pm. She told Daily Sun: “My show is about all sorts of issues women face daily. It caters to every age group. “I choose a topic and then invite the relevant experts. The main aim of my show is to empower women and encourage them to be confident.” Nonkanyiso is not new to radio. While studying towards a diploma in journalism at Rosebank College, she joined uMgungundlovu FM, where she hosted a youth show every Saturday. “Radio has always been my first love. I did the show on uMgungundlovu FM for two years,” she said. She said most people define her as Zuma’s youngest fiancee, but she said she’s not moved by how people expect her to live her life. “I’m a modern woman. But I also believe in my culture and customs, so I keep things simple and straightforward. I’m a straight talker. My heart and personality draw people,” she said. Nonkanyiso said her fans should expect bigger things from her.
