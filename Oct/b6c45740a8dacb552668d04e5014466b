OLWETHU Dineka (17) from Soshanguve, Tshwane uses rubbish to make speakers. He started making speakers when he was 10 years old. “I love what I do. Not a lot of my peers have this skill,” said Olwethu. He uses items such as plastic bottles to make the speakers. Olwethu said he got the bottles from people’s rubbish bins, while some of the parts were taken from old electrical appliances such as TVs and radios. “Going through rubbish bins can be discouraging, especially when your peers are laughing at you. But I’m not bothered because I love what I do,” he said. At first, Olwethu struggled to design the speakers. “I’d make the speakers, but I’d struggle when it was time to decorate them,” he said. He said his speakers were modern. They have features such as bluetooth connectivity and a USB and memory card drive. His mum, Zandile Dineka (37) helps him by buying some of the parts he needs. Although Zandile feared Olwethu’s hobby would interfere with his school work, she gave him the benefit of the doubt. “No parent would be happy with a child who spent more time doing other things instead of their school work. “But I saw how passionate he was about this and told him he could make the speakers after completing his school work,” said Zandile. “He surprised me. I love how disciplined and focused he is.” When she saw how well he managed his time, she started supporting Olwethu’s initiative. His dream is to become a mechanical engineer. “My work isn’t limited to making speakers. “I want to do much more in the world of mechanics.”
