Fashion designer, Kentse Masilo has made history by becoming the first ever winner of Project Runway South Africa. Kentse walked away with that fabulous prize package last night on the finale of the show’s first season in Mzansi. Kentse’s collection was a beautiful blend of modern, yet timeless chic with stunning mesh detailing perfectly paired with shades of grey and pink. The finale of the show was filmed last month at Menlyn Park mall in Tshwane in front of a live audience. The Daily Sun was in attendance at the filming of the episode and can attest that Kentse’s designs look even better off-screen. Nevertheless, the news of her win has been met with mixed reactions on social media. Most people seem to be happy for the young designer, while others have accused the judges of favouring her.
