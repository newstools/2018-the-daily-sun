ONE person died and hundreds were left homeless after a shack fire broke out in Town Two, in Khayelitsha in Cape Town, during the early hours of Saturday morning. It is understood the fire, fanned by very strong winds, destroyed more than 300 structures, leaving many displaced. Authorities are working to confirm if another person died in the blaze. “I thought many people would die. The wind was so strong and I was worried about my wife and two children. This is very sad. We are left with nothing,” said resident Lizalise Madyibi (47). Community leader Collen Nomatiti (39) said they were not sure how the fire started. “The owner of the shack where the fire started died and we can only speculate. The fire started after 2am and many people could not save their belongings. We will need help to get back up and live normally again,” Collen said. Western Cape Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela visited the area accompanied by Allan Winde, who has moved from the economic opportunities portfolio to community safety. The City of Cape Town’s safety and security MMC. JP Smith said residents would receive meals and fire-starter kits.
