RICHMOND municipal manager Bongiwe Mnikathi’s security has been beefed up after   she allegedly received death threats. She told the People’s Paper this week that she received the text message on Friday from an unknown number. The sender apparently said in the message that Mnikathi would not live to see 8 October if she did not stop investigating certain projects or did not resign. Part of the message reads: “I’m not scared of you, and if you continue interfering in the work being done on phase 3 you will follow Sbusiso. And you won’t live to see 8 October.” Mnikathi took over the position after former manager Sibusiso Sithole was gunned down in March last year. “Although this is scary, I won’t leave my job,” she told Daily Sun. “It does worry me that the former municipal manager was killed. My life is in danger. “I’ve decided to beef up security for my safety because I don’t know who’s behind this.” Mnikathi was suspended three months ago after municipal workers and management accused her of maladministration and corruption. Mnikathi claimed the allegations against her came shortly after she had started investigating certain projects and irregularities in the awarding of tenders. “My job is to make sure that funds that are meant for service delivery are used correctly,” said Mnikathi. “I’m not going to run away from my duties.” Municipal spokesman Sibonelo Bhengu said Mnikathi had not told them about any death threats. They only heard about threats on the life of the municipality’s senior accounting officer in the media. “She was expected to appear before council on Monday regarding internal charges of maladministration and corruption,” said Bhengu. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed that a case of intimidation was opened at Alexandra Road Police Station in Pietermaritzburg.
