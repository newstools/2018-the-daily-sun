POLICE have warned they will open cases of perjury (lying) against people who falsely report hijackings. Although the police crime statistics show hijackings have decreased, there has been a spike in some areas, like the Joburg inner city. However, the police claim not all reported cases are genuine. They say some apparent victims just want to claim from their car insurance companies. Police spokesman Captain Richard Munyani said there had been a spike in hijackings reported at Jeppe Police Station. “We are sending a stern warning to those who open false cases that they will be arrested and prosecuted,” he said. Munyani said in some cases, people claimed they had been hijacked when they had actually sold their cars. However, the police have appealed to car owners to be careful in Bez Valley and Jeppestown. “In most cases, the victims are hijacked while sitting in their parked cars on the street at night,” said Munyani. “There is also a new trend where criminals are targeting cars at events, parties and churches. The criminals are aware the cars have alarms so they will fiddle with them to activate the alarm and hijack the owners when they come out to check on their car.” The police have urged car owners not to sit in their vehicles in quiet areas. Motorists are urged to be careful at traffic lights and to drive past their houses to the nearest police station if they suspect they are being followed.
