THE South African Police Service Tactical Response Team (TRT) arrested a group of alleged CIT robbers, who were in the middle of planning a cash-in-transit robbery in Mahikeng. Cops spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said the TRT arrested 9 suspects and recovered six firearms including one AK-47 rifle, handguns and an Uzi, four luxury vehicles including a black Jeep, an Audi Q5, a Mercedes ML and a Ford Ranger. “Earlier today, the team acted on information that a group was gathered at a house in Riviera Park, Mahikeng in the North West Province, where they were planning a heist. While at the house arresting six suspects, four more suspects arrived. They noticed the presence of the police and fled resulting in a high speed car chase. During the chase, police fired shots at the suspect vehicle forcing it to a halt. Three suspects were arrested while the fourth escaped,” Naidoo said. This follows the arrest of 12 suspects a week ago in Midrand for also planning a cash-in-transit heist. “If these criminals were not aware before that we have infiltrated their criminal operations, they most certainly will know now that we know about their activities”, National Police Commissioner General Sitole.
