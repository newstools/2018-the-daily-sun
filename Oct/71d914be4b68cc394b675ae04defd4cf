A 1.4 meter
Mozambican spitting cobra was caught outside a house in Dawncrest Verulam, in
KwaZulu Natal. The snake
was reportedly seen on Friday last week, by a taxi full of school children
outside the home. According
to Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) spokesperson Prem Balram, the driver
managed to capture a video of the snake entering the property. RUSA was called
out to the scene and attempted to search for the snake without success. The unit once
again received a call reporting the snake on the property. “Upon
arrival, officers spotted the snake and identified it as the highly venomous
Mozambican spitting cobra. The snake
managed to enter a hole on a steep embankment,” Balram said. Snake
catcher Jason Arnold from Universal Reptiles was contacted to safely remove the
snake from the property. He
reportedly dug up a small portion of the embankment and captured the snake. The Cobra
was removed from the property and will be relocated to its natural environment
away from people and homes.
