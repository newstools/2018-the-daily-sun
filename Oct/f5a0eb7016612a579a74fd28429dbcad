MUZOMUHLE Primary School in B section, Umlazi, south of Durban, is still damaged after a storm laid waste to a number of classrooms. A year later, the windows and roofs are still damaged. Parents said they immediately reported the damage to the education department but nothing has been done. School governing body chairman Jabulani Shezi (53) said: “Three damaged classrooms can’t be used. “Water leaks into the classrooms during a storm. “Pupils were moved to other classrooms because we didn’t want them to get sick. “We couldn’t accept new pupils this year because we don’t have enough classrooms.” Shezi said the governing body was planning to hold a meeting with parents to discuss the matter. “If the department fails to do something, we will have to go to its offices to speak to the MEC.” The principal refused to give a comment and referred the SunTeam to the department of education. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the department knew some damaged schools hadn’t been fixed. “A lot of schools in the province were damaged,” said Mahlambi. “The department is fixing other schools. Muzomuhle Primary School’s turn is coming.”
