“MAMA, he tied our hands and we are in the bush. He’s going to kill us. Please come rescue us.” These were the last words of Andiswa Ndibi’s nine-year-old daughter Elami before she and her little brother, Muzi (8) were murdered, allegedly by their mum’s ex-boyfriend. Andiswa (33) told Daily Sun on Tuesday that when she called the number again, it was switched off. She went to Kagiso Police Station and asked cops to call the number, but it was still off. Andiswa said the call came on the same night her kids were kidnapped, on 14 September, allegedly by her ex-boyfriend, over money she owed him The People’s Paper reported on the missing kids on 19 September after Andiswa opened a case. Last Tuesday she received a call from cops after the bodies of two kids were found dumped in an open shallow grave at Slovoville in Dobsonville, Soweto. “I could only identify the kids from their clothes because their bodies were badly decomposed.” Her ex-boyfriend, Sergo Vilankulu, a Mozambican man, allegedly kidnapped the two kids after an argument with their mother. The kids’ dad, Musa Nkosi, said his kids were killed because their mum failed to pay back the R18 000 Sergo gave her to invest on his behalf as he didn’t have an ID. Andiswa said she only got R7 000 from Sergo to put in her bank account. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said a post mortem was conducted after the kids’ bodies were identified by their mother. He told the People’s Paper a manhunt has since launched for the suspect, who now face two murder charges.
