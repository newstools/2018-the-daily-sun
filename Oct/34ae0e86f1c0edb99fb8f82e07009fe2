The South African National Taxi Council embarked on an awareness campaign on Monday. Council members visited KwaMashu taxi rank north of Durban to educate drivers and their assistants about road rules. Drivers and passengers who said they respected road rules were urged to continue to do so. saNTACO KZN chairman Boy Zondi said drivers should learn to work with cops as they were not their enemies. “Taxi drivers, please help us curb accidents on our roads because you carry several lives in one load,” said Zondi. He said the taxi industry was not a hiding place for thugs. “We shouldn’t allow thugs in our industry. We should stop killing each other. I’ve been told some politicians get their hitmen from our industry,” said Zondi. Driver Mlungisi Sithole (44) said such campaigns at the taxi rank would help teach uninformed drivers to respect passengers and about road rules. A driver’s assistant, Thabani Mchunu (24), said he was encouraged to love and enjoy his job. “A lot of people look down on us but my job is very important because the driver can focus on the road while I count the money.”
