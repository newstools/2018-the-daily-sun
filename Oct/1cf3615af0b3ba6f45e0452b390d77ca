SHE was excited to be back home after being away for a month. So she jumped out of the taxi and ran towards the house. But Amahle Msomi (5) never reached home. She was knocked down by a car and died. Amahle, her mother Thandeka (28) and her brother Lindani (2) from Amandawe, KZN were reported missing over a month ago. A search was conducted for them with no success. But the mum and her kids returned home on Tuesday. Amahle’s aunt Nonhlanhla Mthethwa (42) told Daily Sun that she was at work when she was informed about Amahle’s death. She said Thandeka told them that the little girl was let out of the taxi by the taxi conductor. “She was so excited to return home that she ran across the road and a car hit her. This made us angry and we blame Thandeka. My brother Khaya cannot even speak. He is shattered. He almost killed himself while Thandeka was away with his children. Now one of them is dead,” she said. She said Thandeka hadn’t told them yet where she had been and why she left. “We didn’t want her to come back to our home after Amahle’s death, but she came with the cops and apologised. We have accepted her for now, but we will talk after the funeral,” she said. A cop source said Thandeka told them that she went to her sister’s house in Joburg. “She said she came back because the children were missing their father,” Thandeka refused to speak to Daily Sun. KZN police spokesman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the death of the little girl.
