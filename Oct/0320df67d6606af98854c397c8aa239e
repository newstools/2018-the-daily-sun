24-year-old Singer and songwriter, Langa Mavuso will be releasing his new, much-awaited single, Mvula next month. The Sunday Blues hit-maker said he is excited to share this new work with his ever-growing fan base as a lead-up to the release of his debut album. He describes Mvula as a “Romeo and Juliet love story”, which is right up his alley as his past work also speaks largely on matters of the heart. “Mvula is rain and here it is a metaphor for love and the beauty, the weight, the light and doom it comes with. A love so beautiful and perfect yet it still amounts to nothing but tragedy,” he said. Langa has also revealed that he will complete the remainder of the album, which is due for release at an unspecified date, in London. November will certainly be a big month for Langa as he is also up for the Rising Star award at the second annual DSTV Mzansi Viewers Choice Awards (MVCAs). He is currently battling it out to garner the most votes alongside Smash Afrika, Vuyo Manyonga, Distruction Boyz and Lungi Ngidi. The MVCAs will take place on the 24th of November 2018 and will be broadcast live on Mzansi Magic (DSTV channel 161) at 20:00.
