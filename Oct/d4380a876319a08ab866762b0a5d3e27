Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini is being criticised heavily on Twitter. This is after he has announced that he has partnered with lobby group AfriForum. He said their cooperation aims to promote agriculture and ensure food security in the country. Both parties are strongly opposed to the expropriation of land without compensation. The Zulu King also said that: Anyone who wants to be voted for and elected by us, I’m going to talk now, anyone who wants to be elected by us must come and kneel here and commit that I will never touch your land.” A lot of people on Twitter were not impressed by the king teaming up with Afriforum. Some say the King thinks he is "special and untouchable" while others say he has always been like this.
