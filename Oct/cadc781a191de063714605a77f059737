THE police are warning parents to be aware of unusual behaviour in their children. This comes after a 13-year-old girl from Pienaar, outside Mbombela in Mpumalanga, was reported missing by her family on Wednesday. She was found with her boyfriend on Friday. The girl’s guardian told Daily Sun she had been caring for the teenager ever since her mum died when she was a baby. “She grew up thinking I was her biological mum until somebody told her the truth recently. “She started being disrespectful and accusing us of treating her badly. I loved her too much and was not ready to break the news about her mum.” The woman said she was happy the girl was found unharmed. Police spokesman Captain Jabu Ndubane said the girl was found sitting behind a huge rock and having a good time with her friends and her boyfriend. “The child came home from school, changed her clothes and went out with her friends to practise singing,” he said. “Parents need to talk to their children because incidents like this are dangerous. You never know what could happen to a child if this became a habit.”
