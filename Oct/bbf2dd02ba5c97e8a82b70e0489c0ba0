THE VBS saga at Vhembe Municipality took an ugly turn when workers forcefully removed municipal manager Reuben Rambado on Tuesday. When Rambado reported for work, angry workers told him to leave his office. Rambado and chief financial officer Nyiko Mchavi were put on precautionary leave on Friday after the VBS forensic report was released two weeks ago. Top ANC officials, including Limpopo treasurer Danny Msiza and ANC deputy chairwoman and Vhembe mayor Florence Radzilani were implicated. Radzilani’s municipality lost over R300 million after it invested with VBS. Workers have vowed they won’t leave the offices until the mayor, speaker and two councillors are removed. Their peaceful protest continued this week, with workers from the four local municipalities camping at the Vhembe offices. Timmy Tshililo of the SA Municipal Workers’ Union said they wouldn’t move until all those who handled the municipality’s money were removed. Vhembe municipal spokesman Matodzi Ralushai said Rambado and Mchavi had seven days to say why they shouldn’t be suspended.
