KAIZER Chiefs beat Bloemfontein Celtic 2-0 at Free State Stadium yesterday to lift the annual Macufe Cup for the third time in a row. Chiefs’ strikers Lebogang Manyama and Dumisani Zuma scored the goals that broke the hearts of Siwelele fans in their own backyard. The win is a huge morale boost for Amakhosi ahead of their Telkom Knockout first round clash against PSL rookies Black Leopards at FNB Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm). The trophy brings hope to Amakhosi fans as they are in their fourth season without an official trophy in their cabinet. They completed a treble of unofficial trophies last season when they also lifted the Maize Cup and Black Label Cup under the guidance of coach Steve Komphela. Having Komphela on their side, Celtic were desperate to avenge last year’s 4-2 defeat to the Soweto giants. They were hoping to improve their poor record against Amakhosi in all competitions having beaten them only twice while Amakhosi won 18 times with 14 draws in 33 outings. The teams drew 2-2 in their last league encounter on 29 August, while they also played a stalemate 0-0 and 1-1 last season. Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas gave fringe players like second choice goalkeeper Bruce Bvuma and Erick Mathoho and Bongolwethu Jayiya a chance to prove their worth in the absence of key players Itumeleng Khune, Ramahlwe Mphahlele and fan favorite Khama Billiat who are away on national duty. However, Solinas had a strong starting line-up with the likes of Willard Katsande, Lebogang Manyama and Gustavo Paez leading the attack. His counterpart, Komphela did the same as he rested his influential keeper Patrick Tignyemb and threw Sipho Chaine in the deep end with the likes of Roggert Nyundu and Jacky Motshegwa also having a run. The former Amakhlosi mentor seems to be getting used to life without his key central defender Alfred Ndengane, who joined Soweto giants Orlando Pirates a fortnight ago with Wandisile Letlabika plugging the gap.
