SOCIAL workers at Seshego Hospital outside Polokwane, Limpopo need help to trace the relatives of Michael Mathebula (32). Michael was admitted to the hospital on 25 September. Social worker Conny Dikotla said he was brought to hospital by a friend. “He was very sick and we were hoping he’d be better by now, but his condition is getting worse. “He can’t even speak or do anything on his own,” said Conny. She said according to their investigation, they discovered Michael was originally from Mozambique. “We also discovered that his parents live in Gauteng, but we don’t know in which area. “He came to Polokwane a few years ago and rented a shack in Lithuli extension 106.” Anyone with information about Michael’s relatives should call Conny on 015 223 5155, or contact Limpopo Daily Sun’s office on 065 892 4670.
