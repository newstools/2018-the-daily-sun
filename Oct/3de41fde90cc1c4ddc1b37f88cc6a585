WHERE once there was a dumpsite, now there is a safe place to play. This is all thanks to SunHero Ishmael Msiza (48). The good man from Ramaphosa, near Reiger Park in Ekurhuleni, single-handedly turned a 20-year-old illegal dump into a kasi play park. He told Daily Sun it was all started in the spirit of Mandela Day. “The place was a health hazard. “There was rubbish dating back to 20 years ago. There was so much that it was encroaching on the road, with only one car able to pass at a time.” But now the area is a safe and child-friendly place. It has small thatched shelter, a lawn and a tiny splash pool to keep cool as the temperatures rise. Ishmael also planted some vegetables. “The kids in the area are overjoyed to have such a place. They play here every day, even when I’m not there.” He said the splash pool and the thatched shelter attracted them to the park. Ishmael said he cleared the rubbish on his own and it took him about a month. “After that I planted trees, followed by flowers and last month I planted the lawn.” He said his main problem was that he didn’t have a direct water supply to the park. This meant he had to carry 20 litre containers of water to the park every day. He said since he cleared the rubbish, people have been dumping elsewhere. He urged people from other areas to do away with illegal dumps and plant trees and flowers there instead.
