ONE moment the taxi passengers were cheerfully on their way along the N2 highway outside Durban. The next, the taxi suddenly burst into flames, turning their commute into a ride on the highway to hell. Other motorists and taxi passengers said they saw passengers jumping from the taxi’s windows and doors as it burst into raging flames yesterday. A 15-second video recorded by a passenger who was in another taxi in the opposite lane, shows the flames rising in the air as black smoke covers the area. Other cars are seen driving past the burning inferno. By that time, the passengers had all fled to save themselves. It’s not clear where the taxi was heading to. The highway was temporarily closed while emergency services put out the fire, resulting in traffic congestion and delays on the busy route, as it happened in peak hour. Nomusa Mtshali (48), a passenger who was in another taxi on its way to the Durban CBD, said she was in shock after seeing the taxi in flames. “I thought there were people left inside but later heard they managed to get out,” she said. Durban Metro police spokesman Superintendent Parbhoo Sewpersad said cops were at the scene. “The cause of fire is suspected to be an electrical fault. There were no injuries as the passengers and driver managed to jump out through the windows and doors,” he said. Rescue Care paramedics spokesman Garrith Jamieson said when they arrived at the scene, they only found the driver and the conductor, who were both unharmed.
