THE Botipe family nearly burned to death on Sunday after their house went up in flames. Members of the family believe they had been terrorised by vutha for the past six months. They said firefighters were able to put out the flames at the house in phase 5 kasi, Mangaung but they lost most of their belongings. Home owner Mosala Botipe (49) said she didn’t know who wanted to destroy her family and why. “We tried to consult prophets and sangomas about our problems but it didn’t help. The fire just kept attacking us. “Six months ago, it started as a small fire in my four-roomed RDP and destroyed a few things. “I thought it would stop after I got four sangomas to cleanse my home but I was shocked when the mysterious fire attacked again on Sunday afternoon.” She said two months ago, sangomas told her to slaughter three white chickens. “But nothing helped. After I slaughtered the chickens, the mysterious fires were still happening,” she said. Mosala said she was appealing for help to chase the evil away. Resident Moleko More said: “This is a very scary incident and I’m asking myself whether the evil things will also start affecting the rest of us. “It’s very bad what’s happened to the family because the fire has been burning for months now. I would like to believe this is pure evil.” Sangoma Mamoya Rakauane said: “This woman should consult a serious sangoma and not chancers to help her end the bad spell or she will be burned by this evil vutha.”
