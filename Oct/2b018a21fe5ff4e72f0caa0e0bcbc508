POLOKWANE City FC defender Nicolas Motloung says Kaizer Chiefs never gave him enough opportunities to prove his worth and that is why he has come back to haunt them. The emotional Motloung gave a Man of the Match performance to help his side beat Amakhosi 1-0 in an Absa Premiership match played at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. Chiefs and City played to an empty stadium because Chiefs were punished for fans’ misbehaviour. Vusimuzi Mngomezulu scored the only goal of the match. “I would like to thank God for my talent and the coach for giving me the chance,” said Motloung. “It’s an emotional night for me, as I was at Chiefs first. So playing against them is a big opportunity for me. I want to thank my teammates for pushing me throughout the game. Visibly moved, he added: “I was never given a chance to prove my worth at Chiefs. I had to move to Polokwane to get game-time and further my career. I had a lot to prove (in the game). I worked hard throughout the pre-season. “The coach saw the best in me, so he put me in the lions’ den. I had to play and prove myself.” City head coach Josef Vukusic was pleased with his team’s performance, especially the defence led by Motloung. City have been impressive lately – they have now gone six league matches without defeat, winning four and drawing two. Rise and Shine are currently in fifth place in the Premiership table. “It’s a nice win for the players even though fans were not here,” said City's Slovakian mentor. “I think they (the players) are happy we beat Chiefs. We were good in defence – I can’t remember Chiefs getting any big chances. Even before half-time we had three chances that we could have converted. But it’s okay to win 1-0. “It’s nice, we deserve it. I am happy for the players, they worked the whole 90 minutes. I could see they wanted to win it.”
