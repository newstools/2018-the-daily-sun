THE families of 12 people killed in a freak bakkie accident were very emotional at their relatives’ mass funeral on Saturday. The victims died on the R411 road between Mqanduli and Coffee Bay on Eastern Cape’s Wild Coast two weeks ago. Speaking at the funeral held in Mqanduli, Jackson Mqwashelwa said at least his relatives died after attending a church service. “God was with them that day. They are resting in peace,” he said. Many of the victims’ relatives asked Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana to erect speed humps on the road. Tikana said the province had a problem with bakkie owners who used their vehicles to transport passengers. “We have a big challenge because people who own these bakkies say they are unemployed and they use these vehicles to survive,” she said. The MEC has previously said the only vehicles that should be used to transport passengers are those with emergency doors and safety belts. “We are negotiating with them, as we have noticed some of the people who own bakkies are also taxi owners. They use bakkies in rural areas because their taxis cannot drive on the gravel roads. “We are here today because someone who did not have a licence decided to drive a bakkie. It is very sad that this accident happened during Transport Month.” The Road Accident Fund paid for the funeral.
