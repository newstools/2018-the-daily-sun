RESIDENTS were happy when a footbridge was built in their kasi. The bridge links the Bester area with M section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, making it easier for residents to travel between the two areas. But now the bridge is falling apart. Residents said it made life more difficult as they feared they could be injured if they used it. Bester resident Nokuthula Mpanza (31) said the cement started cracking on both sides of the bridge early this year. She said now it moved when they tried to walk over it. “This bridge made it easy for us to cross because we didn’t have to take long routes when going to M section. “Those coming to Bester also didn’t have to take the long way. “Now that it’s damaged and is unstable, most people take the longer route.” Nokuthula said she was worried about small children and gogos who could get badly injured if they fell. Another resident, Sipho Mchunu (32), said they reported the matter to ward committee members last year. “We’ve been waiting for the bridge to get fixed but nothing has happened. “We hope the councillor will quickly fix our footbridge before people get injured,” said Mchunu. Councillor Muziwenhlanhla Shezi said he was aware of the bridge but they currently only had a budget to fix passages. “I think the footbridge will be fixed when we get the next budget, perhaps next year,” he said.
