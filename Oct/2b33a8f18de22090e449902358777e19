Rapper and presenter, Tebogo ‘Proverb’ Thekisho and his now ex-girlfriend, former Miss SA, Liesl Laurie are starting to show traces of the end of their relationship. A Sunday Sun exclusive revealed yesterday that the couple had called it quits. Liesl and a few sources confirmed the split to the publication, claiming that they were no longer seeing eye-to-eye. The couple had become one of Mzansi’s favourite celebrity couples since they started hooking up in 2016. And now, two years later, it’s all fallen apart. Now that the news is finally out, the former lovers are removing pictures of each other from their social media pages. A large chunk of their most recent pictures have disappeared from both of their accounts, with Proverb having deleted the most pictures. A few old pictures remain on their accounts but there is a very visible lack of any evidence of their once booming affair.
