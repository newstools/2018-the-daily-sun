THE discovery of a headless and limbless body has angered the community of Skierlik in Pienaarspoort, Tshwane. On Thursday police were called to the kasi after the woman’s body was found in the bush. “We think she was mutilated for muthi,” said a resident. Residents struggled to identify the victim because she had no head. Police spokesman Constable Nk-oana Lekgoathi said: “Judging by the state of the body, it must have been in the bush for more than two weeks. “We did not see any wounds anywhere except at her neck and on her arms. No arrests have been made.” Lekgoathi said police suspected the woman might have been raped, because she was partly naked. He said an inquest was opened but it changed to a murder case. Lekgoathi pleaded with the community to help the police find the killers. He said anyone with information could call Boschkop Police Station on 012 802 0909.
