GAUTENG
Roads and Transport MEC Ismail Vadi has opened the R511 road worth R146
million. The stretch
of road located north-west of Johannesburg, links Midrand to the North West
province. "The
Gauteng City Region, which accounts for the largest share of our countryâ€™s
economic activity, needs a good quality road network to support its sustainable
socio-economic growth and development strategy," said Vadi. "The
upgrading of this road will serve to stimulate economic activities and trigger
economic development between Gauteng and the North West province," He
said. The MEC
said the upgraded road will reduce traffic congestion and serve as a catalyst
to equalise the distribution of wealth in the region. The road
rehabilitation project was funded by the provincial department. The
construction work entailed upgrading the road linking Midrand in Johannesburg
to Hartebeespoort Dam on the border of the North West province. Meanwhile,
Vadi has announced that the contract with Lubbe Construction (Pty) Ltd along
William Nicol Drive near Diepsloot has lapsed. The
contract between Lubbe Construction and the provincial roads and transport
department in November 2015 for the upgrading of the K46 was to have been
completed in September 2017, but the road works has seen endless delays.
