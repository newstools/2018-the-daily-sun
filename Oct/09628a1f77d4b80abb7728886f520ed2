THE axe has fallen again for an ANC leader in the Nelson Mandela Bay region. The Eastern Cape provincial executive committee yesterday announced its decision to disband three of its regions. Provincial leaders disbanded the party’s OR Tambo, Joe Gqabi and Nelson Mandela Bay regions on Monday after they had delayed their conferences because of internal squabbles. This came after former president Jacob Zuma dissolved Nelson Mandela Bay’s regional executive committees in 2015. Andile Lungisa was elected chairman, but he was removed earlier this month by former ANC secretary-general Gwede Matashe after he applied for a lower position while he was a provincial executive committee member. ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi said a task team would soon be set up to carry out the disbanded committees’ duties. ANC Nelson Mandela Bay secretary Themba Xalutha did not answer his phone when Daily Sun tried to contact him. OR Tambo regional secretary Melusi Ngqondwana said they welcomed the provincial executive committee’s decision.
