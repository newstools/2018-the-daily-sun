Bidvest Wits moved four points clear at the top of the Absa Premiership standings after defeating a plucky Highlands Park 1-0 on home soil. Wits were largely in control and nearly took the lead through Mxolisi Macuphu who hit the woodwork. Thulani Hlatshwayo got the winning goal as it ended 1-0 to the hosts. Wits dominated the opening 20 minutes without really providing many problems in the final third. With that said, Macuphu came close in the 26th minute as he hit the woodwork from Simon Murray's knock down. Nonetheless, Thulani Hlatshwayo got the opening goal as he met a superb free-kick from Keagan Ritchie's delivery to head home into the far corner. The Lions of the North nearly leveled matters in the second stanza as Moeketsi Sekola fired wide with just Darren Keet to beat in goal. Wits' defence had to be resolute and withstood a wall of pressure but still relied on an element of fortune in the closing stages. Sphiwe Mahlangu came close to a leveler at the death but fired wide much to the relief of Keet in goals. The result means Gavin Hunt's men enjoy a commanding lead at the top of the table with Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs set to play on Saturday in second and third respectively.
