FIVE firearms as well as ammunition were recovered in various parts of Philippi East, Cape Town, over the past two weeks. Philippi East police spokesman Captain Bheki Xulu said cops responded to a shooting in Symphony Way in the early hours of Tuesday morning. “Two suspects aged about 26 were arrested,” said Xulu. “They had pending cases of attempted murder and robbery.” The other firearms were seized over a period of three days earlier this month in Marikana and Island. “More than six suspects were arrested in connection with these firearms,” said Xulu. “They’ve already appeared in the Athlone Magistrates Court and remain in custody pending a bail application.” Ntombekhaya Makeleni (37) from Marikana said: “The fact that they were found in just two weeks means there must be more.” Ntombekhaya was referring to the firearms. “But the police need to work even harder, especially here in Marikana, because every day people are getting shot by criminals,” she said. Nangamso Soshwebe (48), another resident praised the cops for their bravery, dedication and self-sacrifice. “Sometimes we need to encourage the police because they put their lives at risk by coming to places like Marikana,” Nangamso told the People’s Paper.” She encouraged cops to keep searching, saying more guns needed to be seized. Another resident said the police must visit Marikana more often. The residents said that’s where the cops would find many firearms. “We wish government could do more because criminals are making Marikana their home and doing their criminal activities here,” she said.
