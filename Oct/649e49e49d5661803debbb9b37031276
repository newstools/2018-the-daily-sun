THERE’S no end in sight to the Makondo family’s heartbreak. Apolonia Makondo (54) from New Eastrast, near Hammanskraal told Daily Sun she was struggling to bury her nyaope addict son Arnold Makondo (25). She said he died two weeks ago but the hospital refused to release his body. Apolonia said Arnold had been living on the streets but she took him back home recently when he got sick. “I took him to hospital. “Before he died, he told us he had been hit by a car in May and ever since, he had been suffering.” She said the doctors needed an accident report and case number before they could release his body to the family. “We have been going round and round. “The doctors want a case number for something we know nothing about and when we go to the police, they say they also cannot help,” she said. The sad mum said she was tired of all the heartache and wanted her son to rest in peace. “All this information is just unnecessary. I want to bury my child. I don’t care what happens anymore.” She said the whole nightmare has made her a laughing stock in her community. “People think I don’t have money to bury my child. “We have even stopped people from coming here for prayers and condolences because we don’t know when he will be released.” Jubilee Hospital CEO Damaria Magano said all bodies are released once due process has been followed to ensure no irregularities take place. “The hospital has to discharge all those functions. “An inquest docket has been opened at Temba Police Station and processes will unfold after that. “The family was informed about this process at a meeting with Temba police,” Magano said.
