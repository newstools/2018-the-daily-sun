The social media killers are at it again. Their latest victim, Actress Manaka Ranaka who is famous for playing the role of Lucy Diale on SABC 1’s long running soap opera Generations: The Legacy.

A fake Facebook post showing Ranaka's picture next to that of a wrecked car read: “RIP Lucy Diale – Car accident in Soweto.” The 39 year-old star was forced to prove that contrary to these rumors, she was, in fact, very much alive and kicking. She did so through Instagram where she posted a photo of herself surrounded by her loved ones. “Reporting Live from heaven. PS: Michael Jackson says hi,” Ranaka joked.
