NYANGA residents are helping a family who cannot afford to bury their loved one. Bongiwe Khumalo (43) died on 21 September but she has not yet been buried. On Saturday, concerned residents gathered and started making donations and cleaning her abandoned home. The house burnt over five years ago and at the time of her death, Bongiwe was moving from house to house and her five children were scattered around the province. Resident Tiny Manikivana said: “We know her situation and gathered as residents and asked for donations to give her a decent funeral. “We also cleaned the house and will bring all her five children, who have been living with other people, back to their home once we’re finished.” Nomakhwezi Luthuli said Nyanga is known for terrible things but there are people with warm hearts. “These people have nothing to gain but came together to make sure Bongiwe will be buried properly. We hope this inspires residents to always work together because in that way, we will change Nyanga’s reputation.” Bongiwe’s daughter Xola (25) said she was looking forward to coming home. “I am happy with the support we received. I always wanted to come home but the house was damaged. I don’t know how to thank the residents.” Her brother Timothy said he was living with his girlfriend but would also return home. He said they were brought together by his mum’s death. Residents installed new windows and doors. The water and electricity will be restored before month-end and Bongiwe will be buried on Wednesday.
