Orlando Pirates claimed the bragging rights in the Soweto Derby after defeating Kaizer Chiefs 2-1 on Saturday afternoon.  This was Absa Premiership clash of the weekend as the Soweto giants met for the first time this season.   Billiat's impact was felt early on as he grabbed the lead for Chiefs in the 15th minute with a tap-in after Bucs goalkeeper, Siyabonga Mpontshane failed to clear a cross from the left. Pirates were the stronger side in the first half and they were awarded a penalty in the 26th minute after Augustine Mulenga appeared to have been brought down inside the box, but Justin Shonga could not capitalise as his spot-kick was saved by Chiefs captain Itumeleng Khune.   Vincent Pule then gave Milutin Sredojevicâ€™s charges the lead in the 33rd minute with a simple finish into a gaping net after some superb inter-passing in the build-up.
