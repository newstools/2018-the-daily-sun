IT is not unusual for there to be tears at a wedding. But what made Jessica Padgett’s wedding so heartbreaking is that her darling fiancé had been tragically killed 10 months earlier. According to the Mirror, Kendall Murphy (27) was a volunteer firefighter from Montgomery, Indiana. On 10 November 2017 he responded to a crash on a rural road. His colleague, Colby Blake (26) was driving another fire engine and responding to the same emergency. Just as Kendall was reaching in to his vehicle to get his protective clothing, he was hit by the fire engine Blake was driving and killed. Blake was allegedly twice over the legal alcohol limit. Heartbroken Jessica decided to go ahead anyway with the wedding ceremony that she and Kendall had planned for 29 September. Desperately sad photos show her dressed in a gorgeous wedding dress, alternatively laughing and looking stricken with grief.  She tearfully knelt beside the grave, with her head resting on her hands. Jessica wrote on Facebook: "I can’t say thank you to everyone enough for this entire week! "I feel beyond spoiled and loved. This week wasn’t the outcome I wanted, but everyone made me feel especially loved. "I especially want to thank my sister for being my rock throughout everything, through the tears and the late night talks I couldn’t have done this without you. "Thank you everyone for making my wedding day special even though I didn’t get to marry the man of my dreams."
