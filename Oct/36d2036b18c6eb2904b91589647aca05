ORLANDO Pirates missed an opportunity to go clear at the summit of the Absa Premiership when they were held to a 1-1 draw by struggling AmaZulu at the King Zwelithini Stadium in Durban last night. The Buccaneers are level on 16 points with log leaders Bidvest Wits after 10 matches, but Wits have played two games fewer. Bucs dominated the first half and went into the interval a goal to the good courtesy of Augustine Mulenga’s early goal. But Usuthu leveled matters in the second period with a goal by Emiliano Tade four minutes after the re-start. Usuthu were a different kettle of fish in the second half and they had a go at Bucs, who failed to defend their lead after dominating the first half as has often been the case this season. Fans were sitting on the edge of their seats in the second half as both teams traded blows in the final third of the field. Usuthu dominated possession and they will feel that they deserved more than what they got against Bucs. Both Soweto giants Pirates and their arch rivals Kaizer Chiefs left Durban without a win. Polokwane City Stunned Chiefs 1-0 at an empty Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. Vuzimusi Mngomezulu spectacular goal on the eve of half-time ended Amakhosi’s four matches unbeaten run. Amakhosi received doubled punishment as they played at an empty stadium and they were also punished by Rise and Shine as the Polokwane outfit took the three points to Limpopo with them. You could hear coaches and players voices as they were greeted by an empty 2010 Fifa World Cup Stadium. Amakhosi will play against Pirates in the Soweto derby in the Soweto derby after the Fifa International break. Yesterday’s other results: Free State Stars 2 – 0 Bloemfontein Celtic; Kaizer Chiefs 0 – 1 Polokwane City; Highlands Park 2 – 1 Chippa United.
