MADALA Alfred Motsepe is gatvol with nurses at Roedtan Clinic in Limpopo. They 68-year-old from Ga-Rafifi Village in Zebediela claimed the nurses have been robbing him of his money in exchange for medication. The businessman said he lent the nurses money but when he wanted it back, he’d be told they wouldn’t pay because they had given him medication. Alfred told Daily Sun he has been diabetic for 22 years and often collected his medication from the clinic. He said he has been lending money to the nurses since 2016, but they never paid him back. Alfred said he complained to the health department in April this year, but he wasn’t helped. “It started three years ago when a nurse asked me to lend her R500. “I only gave her R200 and problems started when she had to pay me back,” “When I asked for my money she said she couldn’t pay because she was giving me medication. It simply means I was paying this woman for the medication. It’s not fair because the clinic medicine is not for sale,” said Alfred. The madala said another nurse also approached him and told him to pay her R200 so she could deliver medication to his home. “I refused and the nurse started treating me badly.” Neil Shikwambana, a spokesman for the health department, said: “An investigation was conducted and I believe madala Alfred will get the results of the investigation in a couple of days”
