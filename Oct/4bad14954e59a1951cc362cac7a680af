NEVER forget your childhood ideas and passions because they may help you. When Nthabi Mosholi (49) from Pimville Zone 9 in Soweto lost her job, she was distraught but in the back of her mind was her childhood dream of becoming an artist. Every time a relative had a birthday, Nthabi creates a beaded birthday present for her or him, so she went into this full- time. But three years after starting her bead-weaving business, Mosholi Hand Crafts, Nthabi still suffers from many of the same problems she had when she first started. These problems include support, the funding drought, marketing and a regular customer base. She wondered if the reason business opportunities seem to favour men was because people judge her by how she looks. “Look at what I have in my hand and not how I am dressed.” She said collaboration is also important to help a business grow but you need a business partner who can find paying customers. “I used to get excited when people placed orders because I only thought of the money that would come my way. But I learnt the hard way to only start a job after a customer paid a deposit. Too many people are quick to place orders, never to be seen again. “Who’s going to buy a personalised piece with messages for someone else? “I had to quickly change my attitude so as not to make a loss. “Transport is another problem. I have no regular way to deliver commissions or buy new stock. I use taxis which can cause problems if I’m delivering a glass-framed piece. “But I am a self-taught artist and that is what makes me proud of what I do.”
