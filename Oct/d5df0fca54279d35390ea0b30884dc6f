WHEN suspects who had allegedly stolen computers from schools saw the cops on Tuesday, they sped off in their car. However, they ended up at a flowing river in Ga-Nchabeleng Village, Limpopo and couldn’t drive to the other side. The suspects managed to flee on foot but cops recovered the Quantum they were travelling in. They said the vehicle had Mpumalanga number plates and was full of suspected stolen goods. Limpopo police spokesman Captain Mamphaswa Seabi said the police acted on reports that school computers had been stolen in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Seabi said while cops were patrolling the area on Tuesday night, they spotted the Quantum parked in the dark next to another school. When the occupants saw the police approaching them, they sped off. He said during a search of the Quantum, cops found two overhead projectors, six computers, six laptops, one plasma TV, an amplifier, two heavy duty extension cords, one pair of scissors, a crowbar, six grinding discs and gloves. “We’re appealing to anyone with information to contact 082 414 1474 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
