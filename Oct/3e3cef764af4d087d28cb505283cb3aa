RESIDENTS from rural areas have been urged to vaccinate their pets in order to prevent the spread of rabies. This was a call by the Mpumalanga Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, Land and Environment Affairs to mark World Rabies Day last Thursday. Rabies is a viral disease which causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals. Department spokesman Bheki Nyathikazi said: “Recently, we have opened a state of the art veterinary clinic at Marapyane Village.” He applauded the residents who had already started taking their animals to the clinic. “This disease spreads when an infected animal scratches or bites another animal or human. “Saliva from infected animals can also transmit rabies if it comes into contact with the eyes, mouth, or nose.” According to experts, dogs are the most common source of rabies. Nyathikazi said early symptoms of the disease include fever, rapid movements, uncontrollable excitement, inability to move parts of the body, confusion and loss of consciousness. “After these symptoms, the victim dies. The time period between contracting the disease and the start of the symptoms is usually one to three months. “In some animals the symptoms vary from less than one week to a year.”
