DURING a bail application, the state prosecutor called for the magistrate to excuse himself from the case. This was during the appearance of six suspects accused of killing ANC activist, Msawenkosi “Maqatha” Mchunu. State prosecutor Renee Padayachee said magistrate Ashwin Singh should excuse himself because of a questionable meeting he allegedly had with the suspects’ lawyers. Padayachee said there was footage showing that such meetings took place at his office. She argued that on such a basis, Singh was not fit to preside over the matter. But Singh dismissed this and said he would continue. There was traffic outside the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court yesterday as supporters came in large numbers. Six suspects appeared for a bail application for allegedly killing Mchunu in May. Among the suspects were Msunduzi Councillor Nkosinathi “TK” Gambu, Vincent Zungu, the son of uMgungundlovu district deputy mayor Fucwana Zungu, Skhanyiso Zimu, Ayanda Ngubane, Mlungisi Zimu and Sfiso Mbelu. They were arrested on 8 September and have been in police custody since. Gambu told the court that he received a monthly income of R22 000 as a ward councillor. He will continue giving personal information tomorrow. The other suspects will also take the stand tomorrow. Police formed a buffer to ensure there was no confrontation between the supporters. But they said they were disappointed with the cops’ treatment, who kept them away from the court. Their leader, Mlungisi Zondi, said they would not back down. “This thing is intended to discourage us but we are not going anywhere. We believe in the innocence of our comrades and are here to support them,” said Zondi. One of Mchunu’s supporters, Nkosinathi Gumbi, said they were happy with the turnout and that Gambu’s supporters were kept away from them. “As far as we are concerned, the police should continue doing their job.”
