THATO Makgoga was happy when he met Victor “Victovich” Hlungwani. The 14-year-old referee met Victor on Friday in Alexandra, east Joburg. Victor came through the door, shook Thato’s hand, picked him up and carried him off. Victor read Thato’s story in Daily Sun. The youngster had said Victor was his hero. As promised, Victor handed Thato a referee’s kit which came from Victor himself, Coca-Cola and Rand Water. “I was touched by this young man who said he was inspired by me. Alex has produced another Victor!” Victor told Thato and his young assistants about the importance of education. He said they needed education to have something to fall back on if they got injured. “You don’t have to leave school to focus on football. It will be a big mistake,” he said. Thato, a member of the Alexandra Local Football Association, stole people’s hearts when he stepped onto the pitch during the Maimane Alfred Phiri Games in July. “I’m happy to have finally met my role model,” said Thato. “I love his action on the field and how he blows the whistle.”
