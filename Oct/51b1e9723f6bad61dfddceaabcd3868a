THE Gauteng Roads and Transport Portfolio Committee has expressed concern over the safety of the province’s public rail system. This comes after at least 320 commuters were injured when two trains collided on Thursday night. The crash happened at Van Riebeeck Park Station in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni. Metrorail spokeswoman Lillian Mofokeng said most commuters were treated at the scene while eight were admitted to various hospitals. They were not in a critical condition. It’s understood a train heading to Tshwane collided with a train that had stopped. “A board of inquiry will be established to determine the cause of the accident,” said Mofokeng. She said the railway lines were not damaged and were opened for use again the same night. Committee chairman Mafika Mgcina said: “We wish a speedy recovery to those injured. As a committee we have always emphasised more needs to be done to provide the people of Gauteng with a safe, reliable and efficient transport system. “There is very little progress from Prasa on this, as is evident from the continuing spate of crashes still happening and the general safety that commuters bring to our attention constantly,” said Mgcina. He said in 2016, the committee hosted a two-day rail summit that brought together a number of people in the public transport sector to discuss ways to improve rail transport. Mgcina said the committee was also concerned the accident happened during Transport Month, which aimed to promote the use of public transport.
