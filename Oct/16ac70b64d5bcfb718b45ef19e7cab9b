A QUIET Monday morning was disturbed by an explosion so loud that most residents rushed out of their homes. Residents of Erasmia in Tshwane saw a cloud of smoke above the community centre. The explosion was followed by screams coming from inside the building, which is still under construction. Two people were seriously hurt and four escaped with slight injuries. The fire department was then called. Resident Anika Ahmed said they were relieved no one died. “We entered the building and took the injured out. Luckily, the fire only got worse after everyone was rescued,” said Anika (30). She said the fire grew within minutes of the explosion. “I suspect they were using a generator because it was obvious something was fuelling the fire,” she said. “It would have not been easy to use hosepipes to stop it.” Emergency services’ Johan Pieterse said six people were injured and two sustained severe burn wounds. He said the two were rushed to the nearest hospital. “At the moment we don’t know what could have caused the fire,” said Pieterse. “Investigations will reveal the cause.”
