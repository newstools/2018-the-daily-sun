HE confessed to killing his parents . . . his father’s body was found burnt in the veld, while his mother’s body was buried in their yard. KwaDwesi cops in Eastern Cape spent Tuesday and Wednesday searching for Mountain Sipho Taule (60) and his wife Jeanette (55) from Govan Mbeki after they had not been seen by their neighbours for some time. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: “Police were alerted by the community on Tuesday that the couple had not been seen for more than a week. “KwaDwesi police visited their home in Mti Street and discovered their son Wonga (22) was also not home.” Beetge said evidence in the house led the police to suspect foul play and a search for the couple and their son started. “Community members joined the search. By Wednesday morning, the charred remains of an adult male was found approximately 70m from the Taule home in an open field. “Forensic experts also found possible charred bone fragments on the Taule premises in a spot where a fire was recently made. It was suspected the bodies were burnt there and the male body dumped in an open field,” he said. Wonga was arrested on Wednesday afternoon with the assistance of the community. “The arrest was made after community members spotted him in a nearby street and handed him over to patrolling police in the area,” said Beetge. “The suspect confessed to the murders and led police to a grave where he buried his mother. “Her body was not burnt like his father.” Beetge said initial reports by the community indicated that the suspect was mentally challenged. But investigating detectives found him alert and responsive during questioning and suspected he was a drug user. “He will appear before the New Brighton Magistrates Court today on two charges of murder,” said Beetge.
