WHEN it looked as if a good Samaritan had come to Mandla Mahlangu’s rescue, the 48-year-old thought God was helping him in his hour of need. Mandla, from Palm Ridge, Ekurhuleni, said the man offered to help him get his brother’s body to Mozambique. The man promised to return after three days, but has not been seen since 31 August. Mandla said his brother, Vincent Vilakazi (46), died on 19 August. “I was walking to the government mortuary when I bumped into the man,” said Mandla. He said the man asked him why he was crying. “I told him my brother had died and I didn’t know how to get his body to Mozambique.” Mandla said the man told him not to worry because God wanted them to meet. “I was over the moon when he said he’d help me,” he said. Mandla said the good Samaritan took his brother’s body to a private mortuary. “The mortuary wanted R8 000, but the good Samaritan said it was a small amount.” He said the man promised to return to finalise the matter. “I waited but he never came back. “I called him but his cellphone is always off. “I still haven’t buried my brother because I can’t pay the mortuary R8 000. “I need help.”
