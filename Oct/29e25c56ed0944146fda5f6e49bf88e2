COPS held a candlelight vigil on Friday in memory of those who have lost their lives to cancer. The event in Roodepan, Kimberley, was organised by the SAPS to recognise breast cancer awareness month. Police spokesman Captain Thabo Litabe said: “It was part of the build-up to the main event next Wednesday. “SAPS members from various offices in the Northern Cape, including the Galesehwe, Roodepan, Kimberley and Kagisho police, the Women’s Network and Men for Change will host a Pink Walk to raise funds for the Cancer Association of South Africa.” The walk will start at Kimberley cop shop at 8.30am and end at the Trim Park in Kimberley. “The police sports office will host a mass aerobics session and a registration fee of R10 will be requested from each participant.” Cops were given a talk about the disease by Leone Taljaard of the cancer association, who spoke about how to identify symptoms.
