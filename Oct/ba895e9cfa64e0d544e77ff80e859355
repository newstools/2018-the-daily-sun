FORMER president Samora Machel will forever remain in Mozambicans’ hearts. This was said by Josefina Salvador at an event at Mbuzini, Mpumalanga, to mark the 32nd anniversary of Machel’s tragic death. Machel and 34 others died when the airplane they were travelling in crashed into the Mbuzini Mountain on 19 October 1986 as they were returning from an international meeting in Lusaka, Zambia. Salvador said she would always celebrate the anniversary as it meant a lot to her country. “He and the 34 martyrs will forever remain in our hearts for the role they played in our struggle,” she said. Salvador said she wished the South African government would help with projects to raise funds for the children of the victims of the crash. The event was attended by Arts and Culture MEC Thandi Shongwe, Raimudo Diomba, the governor of Maputo province in Mozambique, and Nkomazi mayor Johan Mkhatshwa.
