As a result, gatvol residents of Zandspruit in Honeydew, Joburg, blocked the busy Beyers Naude Drive with burning tyres and stones yesterday. They demanded that Eskom get rid of the illegal connections. “Nobody cares about our children,” said community leader Mirriam Mokone. A protester told Daily Sun: “As women and mothers, we’ve stood up to protest. “You can’t raise a child and look forward to them growing into adults, only for their lives to be cut short just like that. We’ve buried enough kids.” Residents claimed 10 people have been killed by izinyoka this year alone. “We want government to give us proper electricity,” a woman said. “We’re tired of burying victims of illegal connections.” Other residents were against the removal of the cables, saying they needed electricity. A man who wanted izinyoka to stay said: “We’re running businesses. We have TVs and fridges. How are we going to operate all these things while waiting for Eskom? “We’ve been here for 10 years and we still have no electricity.” Councillor Victor Mafinya said electricity will be installed soon. He said 239 stands in extension 16 will be electrified.
