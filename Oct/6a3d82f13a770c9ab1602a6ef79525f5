EVERY marriage has challenges. But amid those challenges, a couple from Makwarela, outside Thohohoyandou in Limpopo, stood up to say marriage still stands a chance. After 40 years of marriage, pastor Samuel Madzebe (63) and his wife Margareth (57) renewed their vows at the weekend. The ceremony was held at their church, The Living Gospel World Mission at Dididi Village. “As shepherds we have to lead by example. There are so many challenges facing marriages but there is still hope,” said Samuel. “We are different characters but we embrace each other and this brings harmony in the family. “We did this to remind our children that with God in control, all falls into place,” said the pastor. Margareth said they had God to thank for getting them this far. The couple’s eldest son, Lufuno, described his parents as good examples. “They have showed us love and taught us to care for others and most importantly, to submit ourselves to God,” he said.
