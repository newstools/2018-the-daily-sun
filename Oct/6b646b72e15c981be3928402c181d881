RESIDENTS have had enough of this shit! They said they cleaned up kak after every weekend because of drunkards. They are worried things might get worse now that the festive season is approaching. Residents of Emandleni squatter camp in Benoni, Ekurhuleni are warning drunks that they will take matters into their hands. Thandiwe Ngendane (52) said her mkhukhu is right next to the toilet and she is tired of picking up kak every weekend. “Honestly, I’m sick of this. I will go to a sangoma just to teach these drunkards a lesson. I can’t take this anymore,” said Thandiwe. She said this is also affecting her children’s health. “I have three children. I cannot take care of my babies and then take care of big drunk babies. This will stop,” she said. Thabo Mokoena (34) said if anyone had a plan to teach these drunkards a lesson, he is willing to contribute. “We don’t care about people who get drunk, it’s their money. We just don’t want their happiness to lead them into wrong places,” said Thabo. He said he once heard people having sex in the toilet. The next morning, the toilet had fallen over. “How does one have sex in a mobile toilet? That thing is not even steady. They must be irresponsible people,” he said. Residents said if this continued they would consult a sangoma. “We are willing to do anything. They must be warned because we are not willing to clean up their kak forever. It stops now. We are tired,” said Thabo. Ekurhuleni municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said they will have a conversation with residents and the councillor about the matter. “We have given people toilets and they need to be responsible. “We will fix this and bring those drunkards to order.”
