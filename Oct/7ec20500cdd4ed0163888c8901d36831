NOKUTHULA Mnguni told Daily Sun the murder of her brother was something the family had feared. Bonginkosi Mnguni (35) is one of the taxi owners killed by gunfire while at his favourite chilling spot on Sontonga Road in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, last Friday. Nokuthula said they were told he was greeted by gunshots as he got out of his taxi. He had planned to spend the weekend at Sun City in the North West with his family. He was on his way to buy lights for the trip. “The store is just next to their spot,” she said. “Our worst nightmare came true.” Nokuthula described Bonginkosi as a humble and friendly person. “He was always willing to help. He went to church on Sunday and also attended midweek services with his wife. He was looking forward to taking his family to Sun City. It was all he could talk about all week.” Bonginkosi and his twin brother Bongani started their successful taxi business back in 2007. He is survived by his wife and two sons. She said other Katlehong taxi operators have been killed in recent months too. Three taxi owners are dead and four are in hospital after a group of men shot them. Police Captain Mavela Masondo said: “We are investigating three cases of murder and four of attempted murder but the motive is unknown.” The police are searching for the suspects and asked people with any information to come forward.
