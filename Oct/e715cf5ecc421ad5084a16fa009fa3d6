Villagers desperately need SunReaders’ help to trace the family of the late Kenneth Moyo. Kenneth, from Bulawayo in Zimbabwe, arrived in Ntshingeni Village in Cofimvaba in 2008. He did piece jobs and built houses in the area. He met and fell in love with Nomawethu Velani (66) and decided not to return home. He died in 2011. While he was still alive, Kenneth would tell community members he wanted to be buried close to a river as that was the only way his spirit could find its way back to Zimbabwe. Nomawethu told Daily Sun: “He came here with my neighbour to fix his house in 2008. The plan was for him to fix the house and return back to Joburg, where he lived.” She said Kenneth decided to stay because he loved the village and community members were welcoming. “They called him Bhayi and he built a number of houses here,” she said. “He used to attend a traditional gathering and that was when he told some of the men in the village his wish to be buried near a river.” According to Nomawethu, they tried to look for his family with no luck as he had lost contact with them. She said she had given him a dignified burial but felt his spirit was not at peace. “I dream about him now and then, looking at me but not saying anything,” said Nomawethu. Community leader Andile Dontwana said: “What we want is for his family to know where he was buried and to know his spirit is on its way to Zimbabwe. “Unfortunately he never said how long his spirit would take to reach Zimbabwe.”
