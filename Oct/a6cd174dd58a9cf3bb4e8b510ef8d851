Rapper, Nasty C has collaborated with a major fast-food outlet to fight the shocking static of childhood malnutrition in South Africa. After weeks of the hashtag #1120Under5 doing the rounds on social media, with many wondering what it could possibly mean, the cat is finally out the bag. Fans had speculated that 1120 under 5 was perhaps Nasty C’s next album or even a clothing range, but instead, it is a sad statistic. The 1120 under 5 is a social movement campaign, between Nasty C and KFC’s Add Hope initiative, that was created to "highlight the impact of childhood hunger in SA using an official stat," said KFC. “It’s not a track, an album, or a new label. 1120 kids under five die of malnutrition every year. I’ve taken a stand to drop this stat. Together we can change lives, make a difference. Join the movement at 1120under5.com,” Nasty C said in a video. Nasty C and KFC have identified that child hunger and malnutrition is a major issue in our country and together, they will use their resources to involve Mzansi’s biggest personalities to help bring this injustice into the spotlight. The campaign is also asking everyone who makes a purchase at KFC to add only R2 to the Add Hope campaign, which goes towards feeding a hungry child. You may also visit www. kfc.co.za/addhope/donate to donate either R2, R10, R20, R50 or R100. 1120 under 5 has also asked that if you are unable to donate money, that you donate your reach by sharing news of the campaign on your social media pages. The KFC Add Hope initiative has raised over four hundred and ninety-two million Rand towards alleviating child hunger to date.
