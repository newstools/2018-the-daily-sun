THUGS had to run away empty handed after they failed to
smash BMW windows in an attempted hijacking on Wednesday night. In the video, published on Facebook by Intelligence Bureau
SA, three thugs are seen approaching a BMW that was waiting for the boom to open. One of the thugs had a weapon he used to hit the window three times. But his weapon just
bounced. The failed robbery took place in Morningside, Joburg. People on social media have been wondering what the windows are made of.
