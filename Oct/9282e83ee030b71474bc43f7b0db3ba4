SASSA officials are supposed to help social grant beneficiaries get their money in an efficient manner. Many of these officials have been doing the job for so long, you’d think they knew what to do by now. But grant beneficiaries who have to go to Sassa offices said they were gatvol of the poor service they received. They claim that officials at these offices turned them away without giving them reasonable explanations. This week new applicants told Daily Sun they were denied an opportunity to apply for grants. They said they were simply turned away and even those who wanted to apply for children’s grants received the same treatment. Lucky Phophi (62) from Block T in Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, said: “We cannot stand the bad treatment any longer. Every time we visit these offices they tell us stories. We are tired of their excuses.” Lucky said this week the officials told them they were helping those with old Sassa cards to get new ones. Sibongile Moralo (60) from Soshanguve said she and her sick 20-year-old daughter were starving. She said officials had been dishing up the same excuse since January, telling her they were offline. Sassa Gauteng spokeswoman Nandi Mosia apologised for the inconvenienceand said their system was fully functional again. Mosia added that people who were turned away should insist on speaking to the team leader and report the official if the reasons given were unsatisfactory.
