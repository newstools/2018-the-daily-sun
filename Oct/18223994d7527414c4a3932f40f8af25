LIVESTOCK owners from Qumbu in OR Tambo have had enough of the thieves in their village. According to residents, hundreds of animals have gone missing this year. Thembekile Mngcutsha (38) believes a stock theft syndicate is to blame. Mngcutsha said he lost 102 sheep in May. “I woke up one day and my sheep were gone. I looked everywhere for them. “The thieves opened the bottom of my kraal and took my sheep. “I didn’t hear anything that night.” Bhalisile Mbuku (68) said he was devastated when his sheep were stolen in March. “The sheep were my investment. “It breaks my heart that there are people who make their living by stealing livestock,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Khaya Tonjeni said: “Officers conducted a stock theft operation in hard hit policing areas around the province. “Within a week, livestock worth over R2 million was recovered and 11 suspects were arrested. “The recoveries include 478 sheep, 180 goats, 80 cattle and seven horses,” he said. “In Qumbu, 50 cattle, 29 goats, 215 sheep were recovered, as well as a horse. “Some of the livestock was positively identified and returned to the owners. “The rest of the animals were kept at the Mhlontlo municipal impound and will be given to the lawful owners on the last day of the operation. “Police are appealing to anyone who has lost sheep or cattle to go to the pound to identify their stock.”
