RANGERS last week shot an elephant that was terrorising villagers. They handed the big carcass over to the villagers in Xigalo, near Malamulele in Limpopo, and they had a huge elephant’s meat feast. But on Sunday, another elephant was spotted in the bush near the Luvhuvu River, not far from the village. The elephants were believed to have crossed the border between Zimbabwe and Mzansi two weeks ago. Dashen Baloyi (25) was on his way to do his laundry when he saw the elephant from a distance, drinking water in the river. “I was so scared. I’ve never seen such a big animal in my life. I ran home before the elephant could see me.” He called the rangers, but when they got there the elephant was nowhere to be found. Gezani Maluleke (50) said: “We’ve become prisoners in our village. “We’re even scared to go to the bush to fetch our cattle because of this elephant. “We appeal to the rangers to capture the elephant before it kills us.” Thomas Chauke from SA Wildlife Trade and Regulations said they received a report from the villagers about the elephant. “But when we rushed to the area the animal had already left,” he said. “We appeal to the villagers to stay away from the bush until the elephant is captured.”
