TWO men alleged to have confronted security
guards after loading cash into an ATM machine at Nkambako village outside
Tzaneen have been arrested. Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said
the men are between the ages of 35 and 41. The third accomplice allegedly confronted three
security guards after loading the money. Maluleke said the suspects managed to take one
rifle from the guards before fleeing the scene on foot. They reportedly left their getaway car at the
scene. He said the car they left behind was reported
stolen in Namakgale earlier this year. “A swift investigation by the Hawks’ Serious
Organised Crime Investigation unit with the assistance of Tzaneen Tracing Team
resulted in the arrest of two suspects over the past weekend,” Maluleke said. The duo has since appeared at the Ritavi
Magistrate’s Court facing charges of attempted cash-in-transit robbery. They were
both remanded in custody. Maluleke said the search for outstanding suspect
is on-going.
