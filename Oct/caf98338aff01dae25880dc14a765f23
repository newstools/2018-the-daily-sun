SEVEN suspects will appear in the Motherwell Magistrates Court today on charges of hijacking. The suspects hijacked three delivery vehicles in separate incidents. The vehicles were hijacked in various parts of Motherwell on Thursday. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: “Police arrested six men and a woman following the hijacking of three delivery vehicles in separate incidents. “In the first incident, a delivery vehicle was hijacked on Ranisi Street, NU8, Motherwell by three armed suspects. The driver and his assistants were allegedly forced onto the back of the vehicle and the suspects drove off with them. At the first traffic lights, they managed to jump off the vehicle and ran away to alert police. “The vehicle was recovered abandoned at NU1 on Mvubu Street.” Beetge said in the second incident, a bakkie used as a courier was hijacked at gun-point by two armed suspects on Govan Mbeki Avenue. “The driver and his assistant were delivering parcels when the incident happened. “The vehicle was found abandoned less than 10 minutes later on Bart Street in Ezinyoka. Some parcels were missing from the vehicle. In another incident, a delivery vehicle delivering cosmetic products was hijacked on Captain Street, NU10, Motherwell,” said Beetge. “Police received information that led them to a house in NU1 Ingwe Street, where boxes containing cosmetic products were discovered and confiscated.”
