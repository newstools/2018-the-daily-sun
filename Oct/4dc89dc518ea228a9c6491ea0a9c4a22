GOLDEN Arrows coach Clinton Larsen is concerned about his strikers’ lack of killer instinct in front of goal. The coach shared his concerns after his charges registered only their second win in nine league matches on Sunday when they beat rookies Black Leopards 1-0 at Princess Magogo Stadium. Abafana Bes’thende had a rough patch following their 2-0 win over Maritzburg United in their opening Absa Premiership match on 5 August, drawing four games and losing three. Although Knox Mutizwa scored the crucial goal that helped Arrows grab their first home win, Larsen is worried about his strikers’ lack of composure. “We’ve finally reaped the rewards of dominating at home. But once again we were very wasteful in front of goal. It was frustrating in the first half when we had Leopards on the ropes. We needed to test the keeper and we didn’t do that,” he said. “We need to have that killer instinct at home. We need to see more of that from (Siboniso) Conco, (Danny) Venter and (Nduduzo) Sibiya. When they are one-on-one with the keeper or defenders, they have the ability to go past anybody – we just don’t see enough of it. Hopefully this (win) will spark a positive reaction from them.” However, the former Orlando Pirates star revealed that his strikers are feeling the heat, having rattled the net only five times this season. The Fifa break will give him enough time to fine-tune his striking department ahead of their next league clash with Free State Stars at Goble Park on 24 October. “Our strikers have been under a bit of pressure. (Lerato) Lamola and Mutizwa’s attempt came off the post against Maritzburg in our opening fixture. The goals have dried up for both and we’re always happy when our strikers score. For us it wasn’t important who scored, but the way we got the goal matters. “I am happy Mutizwa scored his second goal in the league – hopefully this is the catalyst for a lot of positives to come.”
