SHE HAS taken it upon herself to build confidence in other women! Refilwe Mmamakhanye encourages young women with bigger bodies to walk tall. The 28-year-old from Zone 5 kasi in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, will host a plus-size fashion show tomorrow. The founder of Fabulous Thick Madams said she wanted curvy women to embrace their bodies. She said the inspiration for the agency came from social media. “I love fashion and a lot of people always compliment me, and say how I dress well and do not care how big my body is,” she said. Refilwe said she realised her help was needed when other women started asking her for advice on what clothes they should wear and how they could feel good about themselves. “I decided to open and register an agency where women build their self-esteem. “Many of them said they were depressed by the stigma and body shaming. They said they felt useless and unworthy.” Refilwe said she spent her time helping people in her community. “I have dedicated my life to the fight against mental illness and poverty in the area,” she said. Refilwe said she also encouraged pupils to rise above body shaming. “I have been to a certain school where a pupil did not want to go to school because of her weight and complexion. She said she was always mocked and called names,” she said. Refilwe said she always tells her models they are beautiful the way they are. “Everyone was created differently by God. No one chose to be how they are and everyone deserves to be loved for who they are,” she said. She said her 12 plus-size models would all be showing off their bodies with pride tomorrow. “People should come and see how big girls feel in their beautiful bodies and get inspired by them.”
