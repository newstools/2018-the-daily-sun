JAMES Khumalo needs SunReaders to help him find his mum. The 61-year-old from Lenasia South in Joburg told Daily Sun he was sick. Ever since he lost contact with his mum Josephine in 1976, his life had been miserable. “Life has not been easy and it has become worse now. I’m sick. I want to see her before I die.” James said he had been trying to search for his mum for years. “People have been telling me where she might be, and I’ve looked but had no luck,” he said. James lived in Kliptown, Soweto, before moving to Lenasia at the time of the Soweto uprisings. “I ran away to protect myself, not knowing we’d lose contact.” James said he would like to meet his siblings, if there were any. “Back in Kliptown, it was just my mum and me. “I just remember the good relationship we had.” James said he didn’t know who his dad was. He said he sometimes had dreams telling him he needed to perform rituals with his father’s side of the family. “I need to look for my mum to get answers,” he said.
