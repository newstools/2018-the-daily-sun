A FAMILY is reeling from shock
after a housebreaker raped a woman while her husband and their twins lay asleep
in the same bed as her. According to Nyasa Times, the
19-year-old man broke into the familyâ€™s home in Dedza, central Malawi last
Tuesday night. As he was helping himself to their belongings, he apparently
noticed the half-naked woman asleep on the bed with her husband and kids and
raped her. At first the woman was under
the impression that it was her husband having sex with her, but almost
immediately realised the man was a complete stranger. She raised the alarm and she
and her husband grabbed the thug and called the cops. The teenager has been charged
with rape.
