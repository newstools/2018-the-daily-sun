It was game over for the two thugs that killed security guards, as they met their end at the hands of the police. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, an intelligence-driven operation was launched for the two suspects wanted for killing the two security guards two weeks ago in Soweto. The operation included the Gauteng Tracing Team, the Johannesburg Tactical Response Team, Shonweni’s K9 unit, Durban’s Naational Intelligence Unit (NIU) and Durban’s flying squad. The operation led the cops to Nkandla in Kwa-Zulu Natal where they tracked down the homes of the suspects. The police reportedly interviewed their parents, who couldn’t assist them with information. The cops then tracked down a mkhukhu in Clermont where the two suspects, Lindokuhle Cebekhulu (24) and Mbuyiso Mthonti (26) were found. One of them tried to pull out a firearm with intent to shoot the cops, but the cops reacted quickly and shot them, fatally wounding them. “Crime Intelligence and Gauteng Organized Crime Unit worked tirelessly over these past two weeks to track down the culprits,” Police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said.
