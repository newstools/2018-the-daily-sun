MANDLA Mkhize might get his life back sooner than he thought. This comes after Daily Sun published a story about the painful growth on his back that has been destroying his life since 2015. The 27-year-old from Chatsworth, Durban, told the People’s Paper last week that he had lost hope of ever getting help. He said the growth on his back forced him to leave his job. However, the day after the article was published, he was booked for surgery to remove the growth at RK Khan Hospital. He’s currently recovering from the operation. “Since 2015, I’ve been begging them to do something about this growth but they’ve been turning a blind eye. “They didn’t want to say why they suddenly booked me in but I strongly believe it’s because Daily Sun published my story.” Mandla said he quit his job as a maths and science teacher in Vryheid last June as the growth had started becoming unbearably painful. “Now that the growth has been removed, I’m looking forward to going back to the classroom and helping those pupils secure a brighter future,” he said.
