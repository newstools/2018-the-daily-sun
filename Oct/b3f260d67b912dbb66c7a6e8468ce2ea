ANGRY residents demonstrated outside the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court yesterday. And another group came to offer support to a pastor who is accused of raping and assaulting two girls aged 14 and 15. The pastor (28) from Mkhuhlu, near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga has been in custody since last Wednesday after police arrested him. The crimes allegedly happened between August and September. The pastor’s wife told Daily Sun she supported her man fully and had no doubts about him. “My husband is innocent,” she said. But a community member from the other group, Mumsy Mhlongo, said people should stop following fake pastors. “They are snakes that hide behind the Bible.” State Prosecutor Rapelwana Sebotse told the court that she was phoned by the new attorney who would be taking over the case. “He asked for a postponement until Monday,” said Sebotse. Spokeswoman for the ANC Women’s League in Bohlabela, Busisiwe Manzini, told Daily Sun they will protest outside the court to put pressure on the NPA and the Justice Department to deny the pastor bail.
