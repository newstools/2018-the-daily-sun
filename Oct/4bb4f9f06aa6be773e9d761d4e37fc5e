For the past four years, community leaders at Thabo Mbeki squatter camp have been making sure needy pupils lack for nothing. On Saturday, they donated stationery, porridge and sanitary towels. Said Buzwe Kali: “The project was initiated by the community after we identified children’s needs.” Buzwe (37) said when they started the project, donations were only made to children from the poorest households. “Due to the support we received, we now donate to all the pupils in the community.” Pastor Lonwabo Daka asked churches in and around the area to make donations. “We’re a community that cares about young people, which is why we came together. We also prayed for pupils because God must rule in their lives.” Matric pupil Suleka Solombela (19) told the People’s Paper: “It’s not nice to skip school because you don’t have sanitary towels. “The community saw our challenges and responded. I’m thankful to everyone who helped. “The donations will boost my confidence as I prepare to write my final exams.”
