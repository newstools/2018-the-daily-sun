Renowned athlete and world record-holder, Wayde van Niekerk has inked a new brand ambassadorship deal. OpenView, the free-to-view Direct Broadcast Satellite television provider which is owned by the eMedia Group which also owns e.tv announced this week that Wayde has joined their company as a brand ambassador. The 26-year-old athlete will assist the brand in getting their free satellite TV entertainment to the masses. Wayde says that he is proud to be a part of the OpenView team because he believes in the power of television. “Television has the power to bring the entire world to our living rooms, which is so important for inspiring our dreams and celebrating who we are. I am excited to team up with [OpenView] as they try to give free world-class entertainment to as many South Africans as possible – we’re going for gold,” he said in a statement. Wayde, who is from Kraaifontein in Cape Town, kicked off his athletic career in 2005 and has since ascended to astronomical heights, shattering world and Olympic records. He currently holds the world and Olympic record for the 400m track event and is the world and Olympic champion in the same event. He also holds the world-best time in the 300m event. OpenView says they, together with Wayde, hope to build on this winning momentum as they roll out even more free television over the next few months.
