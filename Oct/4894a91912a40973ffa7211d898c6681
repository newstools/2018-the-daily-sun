STREET kids came together to hail a hero! Street kids in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape left the streets on Saturday to bid farewell to their friend. Ongeziwe “Benny” Makeleni (24) was a famous hobo in Mthatha. He was buried at Sibangweni Village in Mthatha. He died on 28 September after a short illness. His mum Nokwazi Makeleni couldn’t hold back her tears when she spoke about how he ended up on the street. “I was working in Libode and left him with my sister when he was seven years old. My sister apparently left him with other kids and moved in with her boyfriend. “A neighbour called social workers and involved the police. I was found in Libode and arrested and charged with child negligence. “I stayed in jail for about a month. When I came out, he was staying with my relative. From there I went to work in Durban. “Then he started smoking glue and lived on the street.” She said she tried to bring her son home but he always went back to the streets. His friends said Benny was a hero. Sikho Mngomeni (15) told mourners Benny chased him away from the streets and sent him to a place of safety. “Benny was a good friend and he always shared what he had with us. He never wanted us to be street kids,” he said. “He referred me to Bishop Tshepo Machea’s church, where I could get food and help to stop using drugs.” Bishop Machea from Ibandla Lasemthini Church described Benny as intelligent and a leader. Machea helped the family with funds and support for Benny’s burial.
