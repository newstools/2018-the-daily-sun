Generally speaking, a gathering of loud men is not often taken seriously – especially when alcohol is involved. But these sorts of weekends – where beers were shared over conversations of recent football matches – led four friends to form Let Them Talk Social Club early last year. They found a perfect spot for regular Sunday meetings at Mogomotsi Stand in Winterveld, north of Tshwane. The stand is a huge garden with a well-trimmed lawn and tall, shade-giving trees. Its walls are topped with razorwire. Let Them Talk co-founder and outspoken chairman, Solomon Mabasa, said they have made progress in a short time. “We started with four members. Now there are 35.” Solomon said they open with a prayer before each member contributes at least R50. The money is deposited in the club account. Solomon admitted that there were many infractions such as infighting, using weapons as well as engaging in criminal activity but the club’s strict rules policy quickly put an end to all that nonsense.
