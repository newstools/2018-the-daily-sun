RESIDENTS of Marikana squatter camp in Cape Town took the law into their own hands on Saturday. They beat a barber and destroyed his stand in Rholihlahla section. Street committee member Xolani Thukwayo said residents accused the man of recruiting kids to sell drugs. He claimed the barber shop was just a front. “The residents asked me for a loudspeaker, but I couldn’t give them one because I was in a meeting. “It’s clear they managed to mobilise the community without the speaker, as they went to the shop to beat up the barber,” he said. The barber was in a critical condition when the ambulance arrived. Resident Zingisile Nakani (45) said the incident was long overdue. “Criminals are coming to Marikana to do evil things. They want to make our kasi worse than it is, but we’ll sort them out,” said Zingisile. Police spokesman Captain Bheki Xulu said: “Six people were arrested for attempted murder and malicious damage to property. “Two of the suspects were also found in possession of illegal firearms.”
