ALL matrics at Engonyameni in KZN have been moved from the area so they can write their exams elsewhere due to the ongoing protest over the water supply. Engonyameni residents outside Umlazi have shut down schools since the protest started two weeks ago. Residents allegedly torched a grader used to fix gravel roads and forced all 14 schools to close down. Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana visited Vukuzakhe High School to see whether the exams smoothly. “We were concerned about the future of our kids, so we decided to take them out of the troubled area because we wanted them to focus on the exams without worries of disturbances,” Dlungwana told the People’s Paper. “We’ve agreed with parents that pupils will stay at Vukuzakhe until they finish the exams.” He said officials had been monitoring the situation since the protests erupted to make sure all pupils wrote matric Engonyameni. He said after their last meeting on Friday, and following a visit by Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda on Monday, they decided that the pupils should be moved to avoid disturbances. Dlungwana said Kaunda held meeting with local chiefs, who supported the decision. He said matric pupils from four affected high schools sat for their English paper on Tuesday at Vukuzakhe. He said they would continue to monitor the situation because, in few weeks’ time, primary schools would wrote their final exams as well. Dlungwana said he hoped the situation would have returned to normal when primary schools started writing. The MEC then proceeded to Lihlithemba High School in Ndwedwe, north of Durban, where a matric pupilallegedly assaulted the deputy principal on Friday. He said his department won’t tolerate such behaviour and promised action.
