PEOPLE erected shacks in Tjovitjo squatter camp and left them vacant. They have now been warned to occupy them or lose all their building materials. Nokuthula Mafanya (35), a committee member of the squatter camp in Orange Farm, Joburg, told Daily Sun they had marked vacant shacks with signs which read “Out!”. “We want whoever erected the shacks to live in them. “This is a waste of space. So many people need stands, so we can’t have someone owning a house somewhere else also having a vacant shack here,” she said. Nokuthula said there were about 20 empty shacks and she believed the people who put them up were being greedy. “We already have some toilets here and we want to make sure when the government comes here to section yards properly and put in taps that we know who the owners are.” She said the committee had a list of people who lived in the squatter camp and everyone who left their shacks vacant would soon find their building material in piles next to the freeway. “They are just greedy. They will come back when this place is developed and want to make a noise but they are sitting comfortably wherever they are now,” she said. Nokuthula said people with vacant shacks didn’t deserve space in the area and should make space for those in real need.
