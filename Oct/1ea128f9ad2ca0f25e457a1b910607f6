Percy Tau is proving to be a real gem for Royal Union Saint Gilloise. The 2017-18 PSL Player of the Season is making his mark in the Belgian second division with every performance. Over the weekend, the 24 year old provided an assist before scoring the winner to help his side come from two goals down to snatch a 3-2 victory over Tubize in a league clash. This saw him make the Belgian First Division B team of the week. Tauâ€™s scintillating form continued on Tuesday after he found the back of the net for a second successive game. His goal helped seal a comfortable 2-0 for his side over Beerschot Wilrijk, keeping them in second place in the Belgian First Division. Tau has now scored four goals since joining the Belgian club.
