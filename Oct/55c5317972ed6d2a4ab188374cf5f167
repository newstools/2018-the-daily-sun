Thanks to a generous donation from MultiChoice, Soweto TV is now the proud owner of brand new state-of-the-art broadcasting equipment. This means that viewers of this community TV channel can look forward to a fresh on-air look. The donation includes the latest technology, a new Final Control Centre with Cinegy Air PRO – a broadcast automation with video servers for SD and HD playout for multichannel. From now on, the channel will no longer use interconnected elements costing money, requiring management and maintenance. This means better quality broadcasting for viewers at home; on job training for local youth and an improved production quality. Soweto TV CEO Bridget Nkuna: “We’re excited about the donation as it came at the right time when we are celebrating our 11th birthday. Community TV channels fulfil a very important role in communities – we tell the stories of our community and create a sense of belonging. We’re looking forward to continue to play our role in the stories of the people of Soweto.” MultiChoice does not just donate broadcasting equipment, but also helps the five community television stations on its DStv platform to develop their broadcasting skills and know-how. It’s just one of the many ways in which the company is making a real and sustainable impact in Mzansi. Soweto TV received the very first community TV license back in 2007, which marked the beginning of a new era in South African television. The broadcast footprint of the channel focuses on Soweto but thanks to pay channel, a much wider audience across the country can also enjoy this channel.
