A video of a Toyota Hilux bakkie nearly hitting a woman and crashing into a wall in Morris and Long Market intersection in Bo-Kaap, Western Cape has surfaced on social media. Seven people were left injured when the bakkie rolled over. ER24’s Russel Meiring said paramedic’s arrived on the scene to find the bakkie lying on its roof and the occupants that were in the back of the bakkie scattered around on the scene. “Paramedics assessed the patients and found that two men had sustained serious to critical injuries while five others had sustained minor to moderate injuries,” Meiring said. In the video, the woman can be seen walking up a street, when suddenly the bakkie comes speeding towards her. Following that, she runs off the road and the bakkie crashes into to a wall and rolls over several times before coming to a halt.
