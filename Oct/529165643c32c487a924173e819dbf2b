A 26-YEAR-OLD man was bust for rape yesterday at the Carlton Centre in Joburg’s CBD. He allegedly attacked a 16-year-old last Monday when she was walking home. “The victim was coming back from school, walking along Eloff into Kerk Street, when a red vehicle stopped next to her. “She said one of the occupants jumped out, closed her mouth and forced her into the car. “They took her to a quiet place and one of the men raped her. They took her school uniform and cellphone before fleeing from the scene,” said police spokeswoman Xoli Mbele. Mbele said cops recovered the victim’s cellphone from the suspect. “Investigations are underway and the suspect will be appearing in the Joburg Magistrates Court soon,” she said. Mbele said three suspects robbed a 37-year-old woman while she was on her way to work. “The victim said she was approached by three suspects, one of whom threatened her with a knife. “When the other two took her bag and cellphone, she immediately screamed for help and residents caught one of the suspects. “Her cellphone was recovered.” Mbele said investigations were still underway and the suspect who was caught will soon appear in court.
