Residents of Dryden in Delmas, Mpumalanga, marched to Weltevreden and Goedgedagt farms on Wednesday. They wanted the farm owner to give in to their demands and allow them to go back to their homesteads. They said eight families were separated years ago and had to sell their livestock when they were kicked out . Mkhwebane Primary Co-operative deputy chairman Kwaito Mkhwebane said they would invade the farmsif the owner did not give them up. He said their families had suffered and, as a result, they had decided to lodge a land claim, which had  apparently been approved. “Should he fail to respond to our demands within seven working days, we have no choice but to intensify the protest and occupy the land by force,” Mkhwebane told Daily Sun. But farm owner Francois Hoffman refused to sign a memorandum of demands which the marchers handed over. Hoffman told the marchers he first had to consult his lawyers.
