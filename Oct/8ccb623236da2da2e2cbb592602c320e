Being compared to one of the best DJs in Africa and the world in DJ Black Coffee, could be seen as a compliment by many, but not Prince Kaybee. The DJ and producer is not taking anything away from the superstar that is Black Coffee, but he would just rather carve his own path. The Free State born DJ and producer has come a long way since winning the second season of popular SABC 1 talent search show 1s and 2s. The show catapulted him to stardom and he has worked hard to maintain consistency in the unforgiving industry by producing hit after hit. Prince Kaybeee, whose real name is Kabelo Motsama, has built up a reputation as a hit-maker of note and it is understandable why he might be drawing comparisons to some of the greats. However, the Banomoya hitmaker would rather build his own world renowned brand than be compared to someone else’s. “I don’t want to be Black Coffee,” he told a fan who asked him if he was the next Black Coffee, “he is a hero of his generation - I want to be a hero of my generation so I am the next ‘Prince Kaybee.’”
