THANDUKUTHULA Khambule, better known as Thando, wants to teach the youth about being a modern sangoma. The 24-year-old from Pietermaritzburg said he was strongly connected to both his ancestors and the modern world. He finished matric in 2010 and went to study civil engineering at college the next year, but he failed a module. “I didn’t know what was happening. I was a devoted and committed Christian. I kept praying but nothing changed,” said Thando. His father suggested that he consult a sangoma. He visited a well-known prophet and was told he had a calling. “I was shocked. I visited two more sangomas and they told me the same thing,” he said. Thando said his life was a living hell and every night he had terrible dreams. However, he eventually accepted his calling and these days he has a passion for the ancestors and fashion. He has a Facebook page where he teaches people about the ancestors and fashion. “I still dress elegantly. People should know that being a sangoma does not change who you are. “It just adds more value and respect to your life.”
