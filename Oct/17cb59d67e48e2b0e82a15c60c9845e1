ONE man was killed and another injured when a car crashed
into a river, at the Rooihuiskraal Road in Kosmosdal on Thursday. ER24’s Russel Meiring said paramedics, along with the search
and rescue teams, arrived on the scene to find a vehicle lying upside down in a
river. He said after a closer inspection, paramedics found the body
of a man lying inside the overturned vehicle. “Rescue teams carefully extricated the man and brought him
to the awaiting paramedics. Upon assessment, paramedics found that the man had already
succumbed to his injuries. Nothing could be done for him and he was declared
dead,” Meiring said. A passenger from the car was also assessed and transported
to a nearby hospital by another service. Local authorities were on the scene for further
investigations.
