REZONING the site ravaged by fire in Town Two, Khayelitsha is causing fights among shack fire victims. The fire victims are disputing the sizes of their shacks. They also alleged that only half of the fire victims had received fire starter kits. This comes after more than 1 355 people were left homeless when a devastating fire destroyed 342 shacks on Saturday. MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela asked the fire victims to delay rebuilding to allow for the rezoning of the area to open up spaces between the shacks. Mother of two, Thuliswa Tshofela (44), said people were being unreasonable. “Our shacks will burn again because of people who want five-roomed shacks. “The idea of rezoning is good because we struggle to get our belongings out when a fire breaks out,” said Thuliswa. She said the municipality made a mistake by giving out the fire starter kits on Sunday. “They should have levelled the area first and done the rezoning. I do not see it happening now,” she said. The residents claim the fire was started by a jealous girlfriend who tried to burn her boyfriend and his other girlfriend in a shack. “We heard that the girlfriend threw a petrol bomb into the man’s shack after she found out he was in there with another girl,” said Mzonke Dosini (54). Khangelani Mnjuza (47) said: “Now we’ve lost our homes because of a jealous girlfriend. She shouldn’t have involved us in their nonsense.”
