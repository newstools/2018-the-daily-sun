EMOTIONS ran high at the memorial service for the victims of a horror crash on Friday. The crash on the N1 between Mookgopong and Modimolle, Limpopo, left 27 people dead. A truck driver lost control of his vehicle and smashed into four cars. Speaking at a mass memorial service held at Senwabarwana FET College in Bochum, outside Polokwane, transport MEC Makoma Makhurupetje said the department was very worried about the high number of people dying on the N1. “We are engaging with stakeholders to see how we can do a cleansing ceremony on the road. Today, we brought social workers to help family members of the victims who are struggling,” she said. Patrick Mohosana, whose brother Enoch died in the crash, said it happened as Enoch was on his way to collect other family members for a funeral. “He died on the way to pick up mourners going to the funeral of my sister’s two children who died in Krugersdorp. “We are now facing a double tragedy,” he said. Evelyn Machete said, “We are trying to cope but it’s hard because no one who was on the road that day can explain what happened.”
