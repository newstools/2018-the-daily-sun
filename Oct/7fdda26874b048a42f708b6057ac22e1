IZINYOKA have stolen electricity cables worth millions from the King Sabatha Dalindyebo Municipality over the past two months. On Sunday, cables worth about R1 million were stolen from the substation at Sidwadwa, Mthatha. The municipality is now asking residents of Mthatha and surrounding areas to look out for suspicious activity. Municipal spokesman Sonwabo Mampoza said: “This is the work of professionals. They are dragging the municipality down. “Instead of providing services, we must go and fix the damage. He said the thugs were stealing cables that supply electricity to hundreds of households. “We appeal to the public to help the municipality identify the culprits so they can be arrested.” Booi Malgas, chairman of Mthatha ratepayers association, condemned the incident. “The municipality is not doing enough to protect the substations. It’s not only cables that are stolen. Cars are also stolen from the municipality because municipal policing is not effective,” said Malgas. “The cable theft will always be a problem. “It’s possible that it has something to do with people looking for work at the municipality.” Malgas said the municipality needed to investigate, but residents were scared to come forward with information.
