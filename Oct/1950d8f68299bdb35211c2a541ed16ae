The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) has
condemned women supporting rape accused pastor Timothy Motoso wearing ANCWL
regalia. The ANCWL said it distances itself from the women wearing
ANC regalia and confirms that the league was not supporting the accused at the
Port Elizabeth High Court today. “The ANCWL in the Eastern Cape has affirmed the position of
the ANCWL with regards to the Omotoso trail – through a press statement, issued
on 21 April 2017 where the league urged all its members to support the victims. “Therefore, all members are expected to tow the party line,
irrespective of the Church affiliation and should at all times embrace the
non-sexism agenda espoused by the African National Congress,” said Meokgo
Matuba ANCWL Secretary General. She continued: “As the ANCWL we warn all our members and
supporters that supporting perpetrators, whilst purporting to represent the
women’s league, is considered as serious offense. “Any member of the ANCWL
found to misrepresent the ANCWL and undermining the position of the
organization on gender-based violence will be charged. “We respect people’s freedom of religion and rights to
affiliate in any beliefs, but such rights should be exercised by individuals as
individuals – not in our colours, not in our regalia and not in our name. “We
call on our members and supporters to support the victims during the Omotoso
trial. We stand with the victims. We believe Cheryl Zondi and all other
victims.”
