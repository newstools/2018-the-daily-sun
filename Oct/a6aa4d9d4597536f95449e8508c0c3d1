WHEN Nolwazi Mjoli was called to the scene where her son was necklaced, she expected to find a burnt body. “I had expected to see ashes when I got there because I was told that they put a tyre over him and burnt him,” she said. But Siyanda Mjoli (18), who was attacked for allegedly being part of the OVL gang, survived the necklacing. He spent two months in Far East Hospital in Springs, Ekurhuleni, but on Saturday Nolwazi received a call from the hospital telling her he had died. She said he suffered 85% burn wounds. “But it was just the top part of the flesh that was burnt,” she said. “When I saw him on Thursday he was doing well. He was talking and eating.” Nolwazi said her son told her if he recovered, he would seek revenge. She said Siyanda came to live with her in Daveyton after coming from Mzikhulu, KZN. The trouble started when he got in a fight with boys who allegedly made jokes about him being from a rural area. Nolwazi told the People’s Paper that even if she wanted justice for her son’s attackers she wouldn’t know where to start because he was attacked by many people. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said they have changed the case from attempted murder to murder. He said there have been no arrests and cops are appealing to the community to come forward with information that could lead to the arrest of suspects.
