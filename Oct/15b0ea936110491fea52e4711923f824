THERE were happy faces all around – in fact even the sun seemed cheery – when DJ Happy Gal celebrated her traditional wedding. The tradition wedding took place at her home in Empangeni, northern KZN, yesterday. The kwaito and house DJ whose real name is Happiness Ndlovu, got married to her boyfriend of about four years, businessman Thami Zondi. She told Daily Sun: “This is the best day of my life. I’m getting married to the love of my life. And this sunny weather just made everything beautiful.” Happy Gal said what she loved about her husband was that he respected her and took care of her. “I thank God every day for this soul. I love him a lot.” She said she and her husband met through her DJ work. “I was hired as a DJ at a show and my husband was somehow involved in organising the show. That’s how we met. “We exchanged numbers, after a few days he approached me and the rest is history.” The ceremony was attended by popular artists including kwaito star L’vovo, DJ Sox, Afro pop singer Naima Kay and Malusi Gigaba’s wife Noma. Happy Gal rocked a long red dress which was designed by Wanita Ngcobo. The dress matched her husband’s traditional shirt.
