LOCAL rapper Nasty C knows all too well about “Bad Hair”. Not only because it’s the name of his debut album, but because he has also had his fair share of bad hair days. During his latest trip to the United States, Nasty C, whose real name is Ntsikayesizwe David Jr Ngcobo, got a haircut from a barber in New York City that left a lot to be desired. The 21 year old was not impressed by the sloppy work done on his head. ICYMI: NASTY C’S HAIR MISERY So when American singer Usher shared a picture of his own botched haircut, Nasty could not help but have a little fun at his expense. “I know how it feel bro. Hang in there,” he initially tweeted. He then used one of Usher’s biggest hits You remind me, to poke a bit of fun at the star. "You remind me of a cut.. that I.. once had," he tweeted. Those on social media who are familiar with the song and its lyrics, were left in stitches. I kno how it feel bro.
