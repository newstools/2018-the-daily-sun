AFTER weeks of speculation, Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has finally opened up about the assault incident at King Zwelithini Stadium last month. Mosimane, who had the honour of being the flag bearer when the Springboks faced the All Blacks at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday, has kept mum on the assault matter, which is the subject of a police investigation. In speaking about the experience of being flag bearer, however, the forthright Mosimane referenced the incident which came following their 3-3 league draw with AmaZulu when he allegedly assaulted a security guard. “It’s humbling experience, a different experience. I’ve never seen Loftus as green as that,” said Mosimane of the rugby honour. “It’s unbelievable that Saru decided I should carry the flag in a big game like this. I felt like a small boy holding the flag. You get goosebumps when the national anthem starts playing because the national flag is with you. “It’s another experience altogether, one of my highlights as a person. You know where we come from as a country, the history . . .” Drawing comparisons between rugby and football. he said: “All I wish is for us to take that (atmosphere) to football and bring fans back to the stadiums. There is a good vibe (in rugby), people are happy, they hug one another. Nobody beats up anybody. I actually saw a lot of people on the pitch. There were no issues. “In football, when a supporter wants to come give me a gift, somebody pounces on him. And you know me, I lose it and I get called in for assault. Against Barcelona a fan came in and what did I do? I hugged him (and told security) I would usher him out. Where is the human part of football?”
