Award-winning duo, Locknville has released a brand new single following their last release in 2017. The single, titled Baloo, was released through Warner Music South Africa this past Friday and the twins’ fans seem to be loving it. This is the first in a string of new music that will be coming from Andrew and Brian Chaplin, who make up Locnville, as they gear up for their next album. Baloo is inspired by the 1894 book, The Jungle Book, a collection of stories by English author, Rudyard Kipling. The book features a fictional character, Baloo who is a bear. “Baloo, for me, is some of the most fun I’ve had while making a song. The whole track came together so naturally, because we weren’t thinking too much about it, we just let the song write,” said Brian. Meanwhile, Brian’s twin, Andrew shared how the name of the song came about. “When we were making the beat for this track, we just saved the session file as Baloo because the horn part reminded us of bears scratching their backs on trees and all that. Once I had that in my head I just couldn’t get it out and the name just stuck. Obviously since Baloo is a bear, the whole roll out just went from there. To me, it was such a great place to start – it made sense for the artwork and the music video as well as the whole release strategy. The track has a very nostalgic feel to me and speaks a lot about growing up and having your priorities and perspectives challenged,” he said. The song speaks about the unpredictable nature of life and having to adapt to the curve balls that life throws at you. As the boys gear up for the next album, they will be releasing a lot of new music and videos and in the near future, The follow up single to Baloo, titled Lemon Moon, will be released on Friday, 02 November 2018. The videos for both songs will be available for streaming on 26 October and 09 November respectively. Baloo is now available on all digital streaming platforms.
