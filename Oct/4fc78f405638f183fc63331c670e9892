ALEXANDER Starkey (36) booked into a penthouse suite in Sandton, Joburg and left in a body bag. The Australian banker who was based in London was apparently in the country on business. At the time of his death two years ago, it was reported that Starkey was with an unknown woman just hours before he was found dead. According to earlier reports, police refused to say if anything was stolen, except to say they were studying his laptop. CCTV footage released recently by police shows two women leaving his suite. Cops want to question the women. To this day, details surrounding the murder remain sketchy. Police spokesman Captain Granville Meyer told the People’s Paper: “Police responded to a complaint, and on arrival the hotel doorman informed them that a man had been found dead in his room. “His neck and hands were bound with his pyjama trousers and his hands were tied in front of his chest. “Little is known about the suspects and we’re requesting assistance from the public to trace them.” Anyone with information should contact Captain Delson Magoro on 071 675 6105.
