 Quality assurer, Umalusi, has
completed its groundwork ahead of the 2018 National Senior Certificate (NSC)
examinations. The council said it is satisfied
with the systems put in place for the matric exams. “I can report that our system is
ready to administer the 2018 final examinations smoothly. Assessment bodies
have been hard at work in the past few months to make sure that the exams
comply with our policy and directives regarding administration, management and
conduct of the examinations,” Umalusi CEO Mafu Rakometsi said. Rakometsi said this year they have
reconceptualised its approach to the quality assurance of assessment with
specific reference to ten key focus areas. These include management,
registration of candidates, school-based assessment, printing, packaging and
distribution of question papers, the conduct of examination, appointment of
marking personnel, system for the capturing of marks, management of examination
irregularities, the accreditation of examination centres and as well as
certification. Rakometsi said this new approach
will ensure the examinations are not treated as a once off event, but rather a
continual process between exam periods. The 2018 NSC examination will get
off to a full start on Monday, 22 October, with the writing of the examinations
in non-official languages. “We wish the class of 2018 well in
the coming examinations. You worked hard for 12 years and you are now in your
last mile. Give it your best,” Rakometsi said.
