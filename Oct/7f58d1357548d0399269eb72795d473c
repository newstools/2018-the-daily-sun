“I feel like going to buy a gun and do these things
(protect) myself.” These were the words of Peter Jeffereys who was allegedly
shot at during yet another gang related shooting in Westbury on Tuesday. The shooting happened less than 12 hours after the Police
Minister Bheki Cele was in the area to address the issues on the gang and drugs
raised by residents in the area. Peter told Daily Sun that the reason he would resort to such
measure is that Amaberethe (TRT) that were promised to them never showed up. On Tuesday Police Minister, Bheki Cele told hundreds of
fuming Westbury residents that the no-nonsense Amaberethe would be sent to the
area to deal with the gangs and drug lords. On Wednesday residents were disappointed by the no show of the
TRT unit. “I was on the soccer field when the Minister was here, he
gave us a good speech but what happened last night is a different story.” He said he was with his friends, when one guy with a gun,
who told him to tell his son to come out. Peter said the gunmen told him “Ek saal jou somer nou skit”
before he left and came back with three other guys, who opened fire at him. However, Peter was not harmed during the shooting. After their unity during the protest, the community of
Westbury is now divided. Marline Smalls (40) said, “As you can see now, the community
is fighting amongst one another. “We are so angry with Bheki Cele and the promises he made,
saying that he would send TRT and would be visible as of Tuesday.” She said the situation in her township is breaking her
heart. “There are a lot of mothers who are here in the crowds and
have lost their children who are not even 21-years-old. “For how long will this go on, how many mothers should still
cry for their children dying?” she asked. This thing is not going to stop until the law comes in. The area remains calm, but today residents said they will
shut down the area again.
