THOSE who occupy houses illegally are being dealt a blow. On Friday, a middle-aged woman was arrested after she occupied an RDP in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni that wasn’t hers. According to the City of Ekurhuleni, the arrest followed the formation of an anti-housing corruption task team by mayor Mzwandile Masina. The task team was set up after the mayor received multiple complaints about corruption related to housing in the city. Masina said: “We are currently investigating over 50 cases of fraud and corruption. If you are occupying an RDP illegally, I would advise you to vacate it now because we are coming for you.” The task team found that the accused had produced a fraudulent death certificate to occupy the house. The rightful beneficiaries were found in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga and were brought to Ekurhuleni to submit an official affidavit to say they were not related to, nor did they know, the accused. The team has also been tasked to investigate corruption by officials.
