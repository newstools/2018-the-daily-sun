Local rapper, A-Reece has released a new EP titled And I’m Only 21. The five-track EP was a surprise release with there having been no promotion of an upcoming release from the rapper. The smooth Hip-Hop EP has no features and is his follow-up release of his 2018 album, L3 (Long Lost Letters) with Ecco & Wordz. A-Reece, who executive produced the EP, is still riding the wave of highly successful B.E.T SA Hip-Hop Awards cypher and the EP reminds everyone that one of the youngest musicians in the country is also one of the best rappers and lyricists around.
