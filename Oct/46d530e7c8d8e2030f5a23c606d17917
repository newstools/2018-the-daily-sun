THE days of the izinyoka are numbered. A serious warning was issued by City Power this weekend. The power supplier warned residents to stop illegal electricity connections. This comes after it was suspected that electricity poles in Lenasia South, Joburg were chopped down in retaliation after illegal connections were cut off. City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena said it was becoming dangerous for their employees as they were being threatened by angry groups of people. “There is also a suspicion of theft of transformers in the area. We have lost at least seven transformers in eight months, all costing about R1,5 million to replace,” said Mangena. He told Daily Sun that this mostly affected paying customers. He said they planned to talk to people about the dangers of illegal connections. The company is also calling on the public to help arrest criminals. This came after armed men stormed the Mulbarton substation, south of Joburg, at the weekend at about midnight. They held six security guards and a staff member hostage before stealing valuable equipment on site. Joburg’s Mayor Herman Mashaba said an electrician working to fix an outage in Glenvista, Joburg was robbed of his toolbox, worth R3 500. A case of robbery was opened at Mondeor Police Station.
