RESIDENTS of Hillbrow in Joburg clashed with the cops over drugs in the area on Saturday. They claimed the cops know the dealers in the area but didn’t arrest them because they are in cahoots with them. Fed up, they took to the streets and blocked the roads, while carrying knobkerries and sjamboks to hunt down drug lords. Police used rubber bullets and teargas to break up the crowd. Hillbrow Councillor Mzwandile Tyobeka told Daily Sun police patrol the area every five minutes but don’t enforce the law. “Hillbrow is the drug headquarters. People are fed up with the lack of law enforcement.” Community leader Marubini Fulu said: “Nigerians turned this community into a drug paradise. They need to go back to Lagos. “We are evicting them because they have destroyed our sisters and brothers by introducing them to drugs. “We are cleaning up our community, making it drug-free. The police have failed us. They are here throughout the day, collecting money from the dealers.” Resident Desmond Ntshanga said: “Hillbrow Police Station should be closed. It’s useless.” Police spokesman Sergeant Mduduzi Zondo said no arrests have been made yet. He said: “Residents claim Nigerians are selling drugs in the area. The police are keeping the situation under control.”
