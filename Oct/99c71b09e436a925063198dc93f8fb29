SIPHO Masilo (40) from Clayville, Joburg, makes quality clothing with a dash of kasi flavour. Sipho said he started making personalised clothes after seeing a gap in the market. “The industry needed to see what I could bring to the table.” He makes T-shirts, bucket hats, beanies, vests, hoodies, sweaters, track pants and golf shirts. Sipho said when he started, his clothes went for R250. “But after some time, he cut the price to R150. “I reduced my prices after I got reliable suppliers and a better factory,” he said. The businessman said he often experienced problems with clients. “Some of them want the clothes for free, while others want a discount. “Some people don’t understand that this is a business. “It costs a lot money to manufacture the products they want for free,” he said. Sipho’s dream is to make a name for himself abroad. He said he would also love to see South Africans embracing their indigenous languages. “We wear western clothes when we could support kasi brands.”
