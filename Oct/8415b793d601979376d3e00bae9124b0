THERE seems to be no end in sight to the water problem in Uthukela, KZN Midlands. Just when residents thought they would finally be getting water, municipal workers discovered on Saturday that a water pump had been burnt and vandalised on Friday. Residents said when the municipality was put under administration by the department of co-operative governance last month, they thought they would start getting water in their taps. Phiwo Hasa (28) said they had no idea what was happening as they had really hoped their problems would finally be resolved. “Some areas were left with no water all over again after the pump was damaged. I suspect whoever did this wanted the municipality to be ungovernable, or the department to regret taking over the municipality. “This thing will make people bring the area to a standstill again,” said Phiwo. Another resident Ncengwa Lushozi (46) said they had been fighting for water for months, and were now back to square one. “I’ve lost hope that the problem will be solved and that we will have a normal life like other residents. Our water has been cut off again and we don’t know when it will be restored.” Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube urged residents to come forward with information to help find the people responsible for vandalising the water pump. KZN police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of malicious damage to property was opened at Ladysmith Police Station. He said cops were investigating but no arrest had been made.
