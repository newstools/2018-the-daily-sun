DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane said the government doesn’t care about the thousands of unemployed people in Limpopo. He was speaking on Friday when the party picketed outside the Limpopo Economic Development Agency, which reportedly has a 51% stake in the project. Maimane said as long as the terms and conditions of the special economic zone project were kept secret, the project would only benefit connected and corrupt politicians. The project had promised to create at least 22 000 jobs for the youth but Maimane said that could only happen if the deal was transparent. “With 1,9 million people of working age who are not economically active and 414 000 people who have given up all hope of ever finding a job, this government is still making secret deals. Some households in Limpopo live below the poverty line and we can’t let them suffer while the few connected benefit through corrupt ways,” said Maimane. “We want to understand things like where the water for this project will come from. How were contracts signed before any of the environmental impact assessments were concluded? Who sat on the advisory board when the Musina-Makhado project was approved?” DA provincial leader Jacques Smalle accused the agency of failing to execute its mandate. “It’s shocking and suspicious that the department of trade and industry has entrusted the agency a 51% stake in the project with an initial budget of R 1,2 billion,” he said. Administration manager Sunnyboy Mphidi accepted the memorandum on behalf of management. He said he would give it to the relevant office for a quick response.
