SA WORLD champions, Moruti “Baby Face” Mthalane and Hekkie “The Hexecutioner” Budler, back reigning World Boxing Organisation (WBO) champ, Zolani “Last Born” Tete. Tete will face unbeaten Russian prospect, Mikhail “Mash” Aloyan, in a WBO championship contest in Ekaterinburg, Russia, on Saturday. This encounter is a quarterfinal of the money-spinning international World Boxing Super Series (WBSS). Mthalane is the International Boxing Federation (IBF) flyweight champ and Budler holds the World Boxing Association super and Ring Magazine junior flyweight titles. They believe Tete can go all the way to the final of the Super Series. They said the former IBF title holder stands a good chance to become a unified champion. “We’re behind him. He is a hard-working, skilful fighter. He can do it. His experience will help him pull it off. He is fortunate to be part of a tournament of this magnitude. They are all champions and a winner-takes-all opportunity only comes once in a blue moon,” said Mthalane. Budler, who rewrote boxing history by becoming the first SA boxer to win three major world titles in one night, agrees with his stablemate. “Tete should win this one via knockout. Mikhail is new to the pro ranks, Tete has been in the game for a while. His hand speed and power will carry him through,” he said. “People talk about Aloyan’s amateur background but it won’t make much impact. There is a big difference between amateur and professional.” Meanwhile, Eastern Cape boxing fans can look forward to two action-packed tournaments this weekend. Today, Thembelani Nxoshe and the Mexican, Ulises Lara, headline a Xaba Promotions and Events show. On Sunday, Macbute Sinyabi returns to Mdantsane Indoor Centre with his second tournament.
