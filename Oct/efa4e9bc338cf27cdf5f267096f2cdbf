FOR many years, sangoma Mfazomnyama Shabangu (45) has been helping people get rid of tokoloshes. He recently helped a man who was being tormented by a strong tokoloshe. But when the tokoloshe left its victim, he claims it jumped on to him. “I can’t sleep at night,” said Mfazomnyama from Orange Farm extension 2, south of Joburg. He said he couldn’t help himself the way he helped others. “I know that traditional healers can’t heal themselves or their family, no matter how good they are,” he said. “This is wrong because I’m suffering and I can’t help myself.” He said he had been to different sangomas, but they couldn’t get rid of the little creature. “The short man with big eyes and ibheshu is messing up my life. He sings sangoma songs at night and bangs the drums,” said Mfazomnyama. The tokoloshe wanted him to wake up and dance. “I’ve been refusing to dance, but it won’t stop making a noise and I can’t sleep,” he said. Mfazomnyama said he had tried everything to chase away the tokoloshe. “All my herbs have failed to work,” he said. He believes he got the tokoloshe from the customer, who came to him for help. “That customer had problems. Things were not going well for him. “The tokoloshe left him after I helped him.” The sangoma pleaded with anyone who could help him to come forward. He gave Daily Sun the contact numbers of the customer he helped. Dumisani Sithole (36) from the Free State said he was referred to Mfazomnyama by a friend. “The tokoloshe troubled me for a long time,” he said. “It made me sing at night and I couldn’t sleep.” He said it left him after he visited Mfazomnyama in August. “I phoned him after three days to thank him but he told me the tokoloshe was terrorising him,” said Dumisani. He said he hoped someone could help Mfazomnyama so he could continue helping others. Sangoma Jabulani Mthimkhulu said sangomas can’t and don’t heal themselves.
