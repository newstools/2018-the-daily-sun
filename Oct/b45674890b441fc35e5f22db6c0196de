American gospel singer Vashawn Mitchell is in Mzansi for the 5th edition of Gospel Goes Classical. Vashawn, who recorded his album Secret Place in Joburg three years ago, will be performing at the event for the second time. He refers to Mzansi as his second home because he enjoys the time he spends here. “I love this place, which is why I keep coming back. “Even though I have a busy schedule, I definitely want to go to Soweto and get myself some chicken,” said Vashawn. This year’s theme is “Africa worship”, and artists from South Africa, Swaziland, Nigeria and Ghana are in the lineup. Event organiser Doctor Makhubela said he and his partners wanted to do something different. “The event is originally from the US,” he said. “When we saw their editions of Gospel Goes Classical, we thought it would be perfect if we added an African touch.” The line-up consists of Ntokozo Mbambo, Tshepo Price, Nduduzo Matse, Takie Ndou and Joe Mettle. The event will take place at Carnival City in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, on 27 October. General access tickets cost R240 VIP tickets go for R450. Tickets are available at Computicket and Shoprite/Checkers stores. Doors open at 6pm and recording starts at 7.30pm
