THE School Governing Body at Vuleka School for the Deaf in Nkandla, north of KZN is pleading for donations. SGB chairman John Gabela said the school needed contributions to revamp the school. He told Daily Sun that it pained them to see pupils sleeping on thin, torn mattresses. “The school is very old and its furniture is terrible, especially the beds. We feel bad that our kids have to sleep on such beds, but we don’t have any other option because we don’t have enough money to replace them.” Gabela said they were also worried about the sewerage system. “Some of the toilets are broken,” he said. And some of the lights in the pupils’ residences were not in working order. “The safety of our kids should be considered. We don’t need shadows near the school or pupils’ residences.” He said they did get funding from the education department, but it was not enough to cover all the expenses of the school, especially as it had a huge water debt. He said the school had nearly 400 deaf pupils from across the province and in many cases, parents had unstable jobs and were unable to pay the boarding fees.
