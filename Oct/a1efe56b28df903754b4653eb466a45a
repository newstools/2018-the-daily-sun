A WORRIED mum is demanding that her daughter be allowed to learn again after her principal allegedly chased her away. Sithembile Sikhakhane (42) said her daughter came home from school on 30 August and told her the principal had chased her away. She said the principal accused her daughter of teaching her classmates how to steal. Sithembile claimed the accusations were made because her daughter is older than her classmates. Her daughter Bonisiwe Sikhakhane (25) is a grade nine pupil at Sibekezelo High School in Melmoth, north of Durban. “He was accusing her of stealing books, said Sithembile. The mum said she went to the school to speak to the principal. “He beat up my daughter in front of me. “I stopped him when he tried to hit her with a chair.” Sithembile said the principal refused to let her daughter come back to the school because she reported the matter to the police. She said her daughter missed many years of schooling because there were no schools nearby. “But she never gave up. “Now she is being victimised because of her age. “I want the department to intervene so that my child can go back to school.” Bonisiwe said the accusations broke her heart. KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the department would deal with the principal. “The parent can call us to discuss the matter,” said Mahlambi. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of assault was opened.
