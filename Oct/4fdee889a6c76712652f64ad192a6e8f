YOUNG interns at Mpumalanga government departments refused to hand over their memorandum to Premier Refilwe Mtshweni’s delegate yesterday. The group marched to the provincial government to hand over a memorandum of grievances to Mtshweni about their work issues. Leader Bayanda Methule said they haven’t been paid for over four months and are not being permanently employed after working as interns. “We want the premier to absorb all interns for permanent positions. How do they expect us to get permanent positions if they only give us 12 months’ experience? “The government has erected a R8,3 million Mandela statue but the money should have been prioritised to create employment for the youth.” Methule said they want to give their memorandum directly to the premier. They want her to respond within seven days. Ningi Mlangeni of the premier’s office, who was meant to receive the memorandum, said they are available any time to receive it when the group is ready. “But we want them to organise themselves.” DA leader Jane Sithole said there was a huge problem with government departments as interns haven’t been paid for over three months. “They are doing internships and have signed contracts. It is unfair to have delivered services they are not being paid for.”
