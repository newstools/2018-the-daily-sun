 Defence Advocate Terry Price says Peter Daubermannâ€™s question about how far the penis penetrated, was necessary. Price told the court that the question might have not been
asked in right way, but it needed to be asked. He further said that an impartial judge is a fundamental
pre-requisite for a fair trial. The Advocate argued for the Judge to allow the matter
to be heard by the Supreme Court of Appeal. While the state prosecutor Nceba Ntelwa disagreed with
Price, saying the submissions made by the defence are a ploy to delay
proceedings. "Defence has failed to show grounds of bias. No other
court will find bias on the part of this court," Ntelwa said. He added that the application will fail. The case was postponed until Tuesday, 30 October.
