MZANSI’S official unemployment rate has increased to 27.5% in the 3rd quarter of 2018. The country has well over 38 million people of working age, but 16.4 million people are employed. In the past 10 years from 2008 to 2018, the unemployment rate has increased from 21.5% to almost 28,0%. “Unemployment refers to those persons who were not employed, had taken steps to look for a job or to start a business and were available to take up a job had it been offered. Now, the main hiccup lies with those persons who have been unemployed for longer periods and still do not find any form of employment,” Stats SA says. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey of quarter 3 in 2018, released by Statistics South Africa, 6,2 million South Africans are now unemployed, and 4,3 million of them have been unemployed for a year or longer. Stats SA states that between Quarter 3 2008 and Quarter 3 in 2018 - the number of persons who were in long-term unemployment increased by 1,7 million, from 2.6 million in 2008. The most affected people were women and youth. More men 51.4% than women were unemployed in 2018 as compared to 2008. However, the percentage of women who were in long-term unemployment was higher than that of men in both 2008 and 2018. Long-term unemployment affects the youth more than it affects the adults. Although the percentage of youth in long-term unemployment declined by 7.4 percentage points from 2008 to 2018. According to the OECD, long-term unemployment causes significant mental and material stress for those affected and their families. Stats SA says once a person has been in long-term unemployment, the chances of finding a job declines.
