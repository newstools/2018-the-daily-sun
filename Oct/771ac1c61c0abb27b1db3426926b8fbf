"THINGS just keep getting stranger." This was one of the reactions from Twitter users after seeing a R14000 scarf designed by Fendi. Fendi has designed this pink circle scarf printed with the brand's signature logo and lined with brown fur in the center. But many Twitter users have compared it to a Punani. The pink fur scarf was sold on Fendi's website but has been removed from the website because of peopleâ€™s reaction. Business Insider reports that While many mocked the scarf, others said that they would try wearing it. The scarf is still available to purchase in blue and red. The "Touch of Fur" stole is available in blue and red, but online shoppers have stayed fixated on the pink version that's no longer available on the website.
