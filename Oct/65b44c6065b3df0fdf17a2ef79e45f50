THE South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)
is preparing to retrench over 981 workers. SABC chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini, says 1200
freelancers will also be affected. According to Makhathini the public broadcaster
looks at taking productions of several shows in-house, instead of outsourcing it
to production companies. The SABC issued a notice to all staff informing
them of the SABC’s intention to proceed with Section 189 of the Labour
Relations Act (“LRA”). “It is envisaged that all employees and at all
levels in the SABC will be affected by the restructuring. This would
include Group Services, Provincial Operations, Commercial Enterprises, Media
Technology and Infrastructure, News, Radio, Sport and Television,” Makhathini
said. He said should retrenchments be necessary, it is
envisaged that 981 employees may possibly be retrenched as a result of the
restructuring, across all the aforesaid business units and operations of the
SABC. Out of the 2400 freelancers, 1200 will be
affected.
