PEACE and quiet returned to Joburg’s kasis yesterday, but for the protest leaders it wasn’t a sign of surrender. They said they would picket throughout the week in various parts of Joburg in preparation for “Blood Friday”. Kasi leaders and the Gauteng Shutdown co-ordinating committee have decided to continue with their protest on Friday in honour of Westbury mum Heather Peterson. She died recently after being caught in the crossfire. Last Friday, Ennerdale and Eldorado Park in the south of Joburg were up in flames. Residents took to the streets, burning tyres and placing rubbish and tyres across the streets. They clashed with cops over crime and drugs. Anthony Williams, a committee member, said yesterday was a shutdown-free day. “Today we will start picketing. We’re taking our fight to the JSE. “On Wednesday we’ll have an executive meeting in preparation for the big day. “On Friday, we’ll be at Mary Fitzgerald Square in the Joburg CBD. We’re calling on all Gauteng people to come in their numbers.” He asked would-be marchers to wear brown T-shirts. “The programme for Friday is called Blood Friday. It’s in honour of Heather.”
