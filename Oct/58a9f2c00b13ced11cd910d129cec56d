THOBEKA Gobingca was living the high life and her neighbours envied her. Her house was full of luxury furniture and clothing brands, and she wore the most expensive weaves. But today the 25-year-old from Site B in Khayelitsha is as poor as a church mouse. This comes after her live-in boyfriend, an allegedly feared hijacker was killed during a shoot-out with the police in April. Thobeka told Daily Sun she met the father of her two-year-old son three years ago. “When we first met, he just told me ‘from now on we are dating’. I couldn’t disagree because I feared him. He later forced me to quit my job at gunpoint,” said Thobeka. The couple lived in the boyfriend’s backyard room. “After his death, his family kicked me out. I was not even allowed to attend his funeral,” she said. Thobeka and her son are now living from hand-outs. She has sold all her expensive belongings. “My son and I sometimes go for three days without food. “I often feed him water,” she said Thobeka is desperately looking for a job. She even pleaded with Facebook users to help her get a job. “I’m desperate and I’m having suicidal thoughts. When I look at my hungry child, it breaks my heart. “I can’t go on like this. “Maybe death will give me ultimate peace,” she said. Facebook users have donated clothes for the child. Thobeka is now appealing to SunReaders to help find a job.
