PATIENTS are bearing the brunt of the strike at KwaMhlanga Hospital. Doctors at the hospital downed tools two weeks ago. When the SunTeam visited the hospital on Monday, families were taking their sick relatives to other health facilities in the area. Sources claim the doctors were demanding to be paid bonuses. Christopher Matsheni (36) said he and other patients hadn’t eaten a decent meal since last week. He said they hadn’t seen a doctor since the beginning of the strike. “I have been in this hospital for five months,” he said. “We are scared because a lot of patients have died in front of us and we fear we’re also going to die here. “Everything is a mess. “Nurses are doing the best they can to help us, but they can’t do more than they’re supposed to.” Nancy Shabalala (42) said she had been coming to the hospital since last week but didn’t get any help. “Now I have to go and seek help in Tshwane,” she said. Patients claim a woman from Nkangala, near Bronkhorstspruit, lost her twin babies on Saturday. “It is said this happened because of the strike,” said Nancy. Resident Timothy Jiyane (54) said he couldn’t bury his uncle at the weekend because he couldn’t get his body from the hospital mortuary. Mpumalanga Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said the no work, no pay principle would be applied. Malamule said all the employees who took part in the strike were given orders to return to work. He said employees were back at work and it was business as usual at the hospital. Malamule said: “We would like to encourage the public to visit the Kwamhlanga Hospital and receive the service they deserve.”
