COPS in Welkom need help to bust these two suspects. This comes after the kidnapping of a 42-year-old woman. She got into a taxi last Sunday but woke up in an unknown shack the next day. Her mouth was covered with a piece of cloth. Police spokeswoman Constable Kethabile Mofokeng said: “We appeal to the public to help us catch these two suspects. “The woman got into a red Toyota Cressida taxi going from Manny’s Shopping Centre in Welkom to Thabong. “There were three passengers in the back seat and the driver. She sat in the front seat. Somewhere in Thabong, two passengers climbed out, leaving one passenger in the back seat. “The driver then changed direction and the passenger in the back seat put his hand over the woman’s month and she passed out. She woke up the next day in a shack in Hani Park, near Bronville. “She managed to flee and was helped by community members. She opened a case at Welkom Police Station.” Mofokeng said the first suspect was about 1,65m tall and slim. He had a medium complexion and between the ages of 20 to 25. The second suspect was about 1,8m tall, dark in complexion and between the ages of 50 to 55. He was muscular. Both suspects spoke Sesotho. Anyone who might know the suspects or their whereabouts should contact investigating officer Warrant Officer Dylan Saayman at 057 391 6265 or on 084 687 3014.
