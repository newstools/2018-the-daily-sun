MYSTERY surrounds a teenage girl’s suicide. Nonkanyiso Mzizi (16) apparently shot herself in the head with her dad’s gun after a heated argument with her brother Mcebisi (19). The incident happened at the family home in Tongaat, KZN, on Monday. The girl’s dad Andile Phathekile (44) was bust and charged with negligence. He was due to appear in the Verulam Magistrates Court soon. Nonkanyiso apparently shot herself after her brother left her alone in the house. When Daily Sun contacted the father on his cell, it was answered by the sibling’s uncle Fani. He said the family were not sure what had triggered the argument between the siblings. He said his brother had told him he left the gun in his bag at home. “He told me he had intended to lock it up in a safe but left it in his bag when he went to work because he couldn’t find the key.” He said Nonkanyiso shot herself in her father’s room. He said Mcebisi didn’t return home until Tuesday night. “He said he’d explain everything to the family at a later stage. We don’t know where he was,” he said. Fani said the family was struggling to deal with what had happened. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident. “No foul play is suspected and an inquest docket was opened at Tongaat Police Station,” he said. He also confirmed the girl’s father was arrested.
