MZWANDILE Nxumalo (35) was sentenced to two life terms and two years in jail last week in the Mtunzini High Court. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Nxumalo was sentenced for the crimes he committed in April 2016. “The accused was a bakkie driver, transporting residents to and from the Eshowe CBD. “On 1 April 2016, he promised to take an 18-year-old from the Maqhwakazi area to the Mandeni CBD.” She said the accused drove the young woman around and veered off to the sugarcane field, where he raped her multiple times. “He later took her to the CBD and the victim managed to take down the registration number of his bakkie. “A case of rape was opened at Mandeni Police Station.” Mbele said later that month, the accused also picked up his neighbour (19), who was going to the Eshowe CBD and raped her several times before dropping her off. “Another case of rape was opened at Eshowe Police Station and since the the accused was the victim’s neighbour, he was immediately arrested.” She said both cases were handed over to the family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit for investigation. “The accused, who had threatened both victims with a bush knife, was linked through his DNA and an identification parade. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for each rape and a year for each kidnapping.”
