NON-GOVERNMENTAL organisations are keeping kasi kids off the streets by teaching them how to cycle. Nomphumelelo Rakabe (31) from Project Playground in Gugulethu, Cape Town, said: “Cycling is an important way to fight social ills.” She said she asked Bonga Cycling Academy founder Bonga Ngqobane (27) to help get the project off the ground. The cycling academy responded by providing the kids with bicycles. Nomphumelelo said her organisation planned to raise awareness and funds for the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign. “We are going to cycle during the 16-day campaign. “The organisation will also take a petition to parliament to advocate for children’s rights.” She said making young people take part in such campaigns would help them become responsible adults. Bonga said he was happy to work with Project Playground. “The academy has two programmes,” he said. “The full-time programme, which has 25 members, is for kids who compete in the Western Cape Cycling League. “On the other hand, the mass development programme is for kids who ride mountain bikes. He said the members of his academy were aged between 12 and 18. “They are all schoolgoing kids. “We have a programme that runs from Monday to Sunday. “On Mondays, the kids attend briefings and team talks. “They practise on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, but on Thursdays they do their school work. “We assist them with life sciences, physics and maths so they can improve their marks. “As much as we want them to be good cyclists, they should also do well at school.”
