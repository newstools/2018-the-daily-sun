The Miss South Africa Organisation has officially launched the Miss South Africa Legacy Initiative. This forms part of their 60th year jubilee celebrations in 2018. The initiative held its first gala dinner last week Friday in Sun City, Rustenburg where a host of former Miss SA title holders were in attendance. These included current Miss World South Africa, Thulisa Keyi, Joan Ramagosi-Madibeng, Sandra de Meyer-Evans, Tansey Coetzee Sodeinde, Amy Kleinhans Curd, Odette Scrooby-Joubert, Sonia Raciti-Oshry, Lorna Potgieter, Yolanda Kloppers, Tatum Keshwar, Kerishnie Naiker, Andrea Stelzer, Vera Johns Sutherland, Suzette van der Merwe, Claudia Henkel, and Liesl Laurie. On the guest list were also former Miss World title holders, Penny Rey Coelen and Rolene Strauss. All proceeds from the dinner have been donated to The Tomorrow Trust and the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital. The dinner was the initiative’s second event following a golf day benefit to raise funds for the two beneficiaries of the Miss South Africa Legacy Initiative. “As passionate South Africans, we believe the future is tied to our young people and, in particular, their education and health. We have adopted two NPOs for a long-term period with the aim of raising R400 000 per annum for each NPO. Funds raised for The Tomorrow Trust will be used towards their school holiday programme, providing skills training and recourses for qualifying school-going South Africans. Funds raised for The Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital will go towards their four bed children’s wards, benefitting children and families with limited resources,” said Thabo Mosololi, Chief Operating Officer of Sun International Ltd, who form part of the Miss SA organisation.
