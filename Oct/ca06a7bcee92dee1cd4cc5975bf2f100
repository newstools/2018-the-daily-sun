Local rapper, Nasty C has won the Best Male in Southern Africa award at the 2018 African Muzik Magazine Awards (AFRIMMA). The awards were held this past weekend in Dallas, Texas (USA) where the very best musical works, talents and creativity from around the African continent were celebrated and rewarded while promoting the African cultural heritage. The awards, now in their fifth year of existence, once again brought African heritage, musical history and culture to the fore. Our very own Nasty C was nominated in five categories, namely: Best Male in Southern Africa; Best African Collaboration, Artiste of the Year; Best African Lyricist//Rapper; and Song of the Year. Although he only walked away with one, he was delighted to share the news. “GOD & MY FANS This tour brings me nun but good energy,” he said. Nasty C was unable to attend the awards as he is currently on his Ivyson Tour. GOD & MY FANS????????
