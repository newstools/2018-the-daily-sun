THOBILE Manaka wants to help abused children in her kasi. The 27-year-old from Matlakeng kasi in Zastron, Free State said she’s a step closer to making this happen. She is a finalist in this year’s Miss Heritage pageant. Thobile said if she won the title, she would focus on helping kids recover from abuse. “My upbringing was badly affected by domestic abuse. “My childhood was not the same as that of other kids when I was growing up,” she told Daily Sun. “It was horrifying. That’s why I plan to change the lives of kids by opening an orphanage in my area. “My father was an alcoholic. “He used to abuse me and my mum. “What’s even worse is that I wasn’t allowed to play with other kids because my father was worried I’d talk about the abuse at home. “Abuse is wrong and should be stopped! “That’s why many kids end up living on the streets. “I want to help abused kids have a better life.” Thobile said she was working hard to win the competition and asked people from her kasi and the province to vote for her. “My message to young girls who want to take part in beauty pageants is that modelling is not about glitz and glamour. “It’s about hard work and determination,” she said. Thobile works as a secretary at Xhariep Municipality. She has a BA degree from the University of Free State.
