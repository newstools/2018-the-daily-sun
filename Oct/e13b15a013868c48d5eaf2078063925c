Leader of the Baphalane people, Kgosi Manotshe Ramokoka, said
that the partnership initiated by Anglo American Platinum has helped the
Baphalane people grow. Since 2016, Anglo American Platinium has empowered Zizwe
Batlase through contracts for mining services at its Amandelbult Complex in
Limpopo. Zizwe Batlase is 51% owned by the Baphalane Community
Trust—providing an opportunity for the community to have a stake in the
business.   Kgosi Manotshe Ramokoka said Anglo American Platinum is
helping them to grow. “Through our partnership with Zizwe Batlase, we have
learnt a lot. We are now co-owners of a growing mining business and are now
able to provide opportunities such as employment, SMME development,
infrastructure development and business opportunities to local and small
businesses,” said the king. He said the NGOs in our communities are directly
benefiting from the profits generated. “You can see how much the standard of living in our
community has improved. Our people are now able to come up with many useful
proposals which will help this community prosper,” said Kgosi  Ramokoka. Through the joint-venture with Zizwe Opencast Mining, the
Baphalane Community Trust (Batlase Trust) will be able to use some of the money
to build tarred roads and eradicate pit toilets. “Once the minerals are depleted, we hope that our people
will be able to develop the area for our tourism industry,” Kgosi Ramokoka
added.
