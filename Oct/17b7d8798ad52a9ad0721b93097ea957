THREE people were arrested recently in Diepsloot, north of Joburg, on suspicion of selling illegal second-hand goods. Police and traffic cops bust the suspects when they swooped on shops suspected to be selling such goods. Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane said police seized cellphones, bank cards, fake CDs and matric certificates, computer screens and IDs. She said the the three suspects were being held at Diepsloot Police Station. They will appear in court soon on theft and illegal trading charges. She told Daily Sun that some of the shop owners co-operated during the raids. “Others abandoned their stores and fled because of the heavy police presence in the area,” she said Nkosi-Malobane said it was important to regulate the second-hand goods trade.
