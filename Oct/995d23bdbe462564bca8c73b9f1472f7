WHEN the sangoma offered to take care of her 14-year-old daughter, she thought it was the best thing for the girl. But the girl had to be rescued from the sangoma’s house on Friday. “My daughter was made to thwasa without having the calling,” the mum told Daily Sun. The 35-year-old unemployed mum from Thethe kasi, near Clocolan said her daughter told her she was locked inside a shack for days and not allowed to see anyone. “She told me she was forced to vomit daily. I was visiting my relatives in QwaQwa last year when I met the sangoma. She approached me and offered to take care of my daughter as I have five children and I’m struggling financially. “After a month, I finally agreed to send my daughter to stay with her and attend school there.” The mum said the girl escaped last week while the sangoma was out but she was caught at a hitchhiking spot. “On Friday, I asked my aunt to go and check on my daughter. “She found her locked in a shack. They managed to grab her clothes and brought her home. I decided not to involve the police because I’m the one who sent her to stay with that woman,” she said. When the SunTeam contacted the sangoma, she denied the allegations. “I never forced the girl to become a sangoma. I only taught her about muthi because she showed an interest. I locked her in the shack because she would go out with boys and only return the next day,” she said.
