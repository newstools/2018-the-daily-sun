THEY were tempted with promises of making piles and piles of cash, but instead they lost all their money. Charles Mauwane (44) is one of about 400 people who lost money through a get-rich-quick scheme run by four men from a business called Financial Group House Direct. Charles from Tembisa in Ekurhuleni invested R19 000 in August and was promised he would get R100 000 just six months later. “I fell for it because I saw people getting big returns,” he said. “Every time I went to their office, I saw people getting bags of cash and I wanted some of the action as well.” Musa Hlebeya (47) from Norkem Park invested R50 000 in April. “They told me that by June next year I’d have about R2,5 million,” he said. Musa said he last saw the men on 5 October. “But nothing was discussed. It seemed as if they wanted to say goodbye. “We haven’t heard from them since. I drove to their offices in Kempton Park but they were vacant.” Warrant Officer Kgabo Seodisha from Kempton Park Police Station asked SunReaders for help to trace these men. “We want to question them about this case,” he said. Seodisha said more than 400 people had lost money. “Over R1 million has been lost through this scheme,” Seodisha said.
