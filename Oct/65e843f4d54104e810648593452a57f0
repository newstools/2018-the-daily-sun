WHEN Daily Sun reported on the mkhukhu found floating in the middle of a dam, Emandleni residents immediately suspected that a mysterious snake was living in the dam. But many, including Philisiwe Mkhwanazi (35), didn’t believe the suspicions. That was until another mkhukhu flew from a yard in front of her eyes and landed near the same mysterious dam. “I thought I had seen it all but this blew my mind,” said Philisiwe. She said when she saw an article in the People’s Paper a few weeks ago about the terror of a floating mkhukhu, she thought it was a hoax. “I now believe there’s indeed a mnumzani in that dam.” Other witnesses also came forward and said before the mkhukhu flew, there was what seemed like a tornado – but only in that yard. They said that wind was abnormal and blackish in colour. “It wasn’t dirty, it was just black,” said a resident. It happened on Tuesday at about 2pm. They said no wind could have triggered the incident. Zandile Dlamini (18) of Emandleni said she was walking home from school when the mkhukhu flew right before her eyes. She was still in shock and said she’s never believed in witchcraft or ancestors but this changed her perspective on things. Some residents claimed if the mkhukhu had been painted it wouldn’t have flown. Others said this was yet another warning to residents from “the king of that dam”. A sangoma, Sbongiseni Mashazi (52) said there indeed was a snake in the dam. “This dam’s dangerous. If people don’t pay attention, it will cause them problems.”
