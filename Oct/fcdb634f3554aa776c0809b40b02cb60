SIMANGELE Mazeka (41) needs help for her younger brother, Sanele. The 34-year-old is living with a disability. Simangele and her brother live in a crumbling shack in Bester, near KwaMashu. She said every time she needed to take her brother to hospital, she battled because the area was not suitable for a wheelchair. “I can’t even move my brother around because the roads in our area are so bad.” Simangele told Daily Sun her brother was hurt in 2013. “He was attacked by a cow in 2013. “He spent a year in hospital and when he was discharged, he was unable to walk,” she said. “I live with and my brother and my daughter in this crumbling shack. “It’s not easy to look after a person who is living with a disability. “What’s even worse is that our area is crowded. “This is not good for my brother’s condition.” She said she relied on neighbours to carry Sanele to the bus stop when she needed to take him to hospital for a check-up. “Even when I have to take him out of the shack to get fresh air I have to ask neighbours to help me. “My wish is to get an RDP so that it is easy to push my bother around in his wheelchair,” she told the People’s Paper. “The shack is not suitable for my brother and may fall in on us at any time.” Councillor Muziwenhlanhla Shezi said he was aware of the matter. “The municipality will soon try to assist the family.”
