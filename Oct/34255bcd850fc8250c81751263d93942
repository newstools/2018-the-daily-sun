“IT IS difficult to speak of Edna in the past tense. She was the greatest volunteer.” These were the words of ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule at the memorial service for the late minister of environmental affairs, Edna Molewa, yesterday. The service was held at the Brits Sports Complex in North West. It was attended by members of the ANC Women’s League led by their president, Bathabile Dlamini. North West Premier Job Mokgoro said Molewa had served with diligence and dignity. “To preserve her memory we need to follow her leadership style to ensure a better life for all South Africans,” he said. Her colleague at the department, Lovedelia Maake, said Molewa never hesitated to go wherever the ANC sent her. Her brother, Fana Mmethi, said it was a sad day for him as it was his birthday. “My sister was always the first one to wish me a happy birthday. “She would call at about 5am. “Today there was no phone call.” Dlamini said Molewa was a servant of the people who loved women, the ANC and nature. “She was never a coward. She never ran away when there were problems,” she said. Dlamini criticised the media for asking where she was during the picket outside court when rape accused Nicholas Ninow appeared. “The problems are paternalism, racism and poverty. I was singled out and attention was shifted to me,” she said.
