FOR nearly three decades, Gogo Florah Munyai (67) from Nzhelele village in Venda (Limpopo) lived in a dilapidated mud house. Making things worse for her, was when she became blind in 2012 forcing her son to drop out of school to look after her. Gogo Florah said she applied for an RDP house in 1994 hoping that the government will one day build her one where she could raise her children, but that dream has been a nightmare that has never come true. This Saturday, it was a life changing moment when Gogo Florah smiled from ear to ear as she received the keys to her new home which was built for her by the chairman of Afribiz, Limpopo Businessman, Collen Mashawana. Gogo Florah said she is happy that she will spend the rest of her life in a beautiful house built by a good Samaritan, Collen who saw gogo's suffering. "Collen first came to us in 2016 when he asked me if he could build me a house. "I didn't believe him and a year later he came back with people who started evaluating the place and started bringing building materials”, said Gogo Florah. She said everyday she would wake up in the morning to check if the bricks and building materials have turned into a house. "I used to pray everyday so that God could bring me an angel and He did in Collen. May he continue to bless him so that he can fulfill his promise. "All I wanted was a decent home.
