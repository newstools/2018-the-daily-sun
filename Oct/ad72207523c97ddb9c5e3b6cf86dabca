The biggest challenge for young people looking for jobs is the required experience. This is one of the issues that will be discussed at the two-day Presidential job summit which kicks off in Midrand, Gauteng, on Thursday. Different stakeholders will gather to find solutions for SA’s growing unemployment. The unemployment rate in Mzansi is at 27.2%. According to Statistics South Africa’s Quarterly Labour Force Survey for the second quarter of 2018, youth unemployment was 38.8% compared to the 17.9% rate for adults. Fin24 spoke to the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA), which has put forward its proposed solutions for youth unemployment. NYDA spokesperson Lerato Gambu told Fin24 on  Wednesday that “experience” of as much as five or 10 years is a hindrance for youth seeking to enter the labour market. Gambu said that experience as a requirement for job applicants is one of the biggest challenges for youth seeking to enter the labour market. For this reason government, business and organised labour set up the Youth Employment Service (YES) initiative which will place one million unemployed youth in paid internships over three years. However, Gambu said that these internships should result in the youth being employable once the internship is over, as opposed to them becoming unemployed once again and “languishing in poverty”. “We welcomed the YES initiative. In as much as we agree with it, it should be turned into an employment agent,” he said. Come chat to YES at the #JobsSummit today and tomorrow about how we're using unprecedented partnerships between business, labour and government to unlock potential and entrepreneurship for our youth. #JobsSummit2018 The summit will work towards a common approach and improve coordination   among stakeholders. As a society we aim to raise employment by 11 million to 24 million by 2030 in line with the National Development  Plan. #JobsSummit #JobsSummit2018 pic.twitter.com/nVZAtC405v
