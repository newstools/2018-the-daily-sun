SIBUSISO NHLAPO has a speech and movement disorder. He takes frequent pauses when he speaks and sometimes distorts words, while his movement is jerky, causing him to fall often when he walks. At first this caused the 26-year-old from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni a lot of embarrassment. “Today I have accepted the way I am and I don’t even care when some call me isidalwa (disabled). “I just keep quiet and say God will deal with them,” said Sibusiso. He said he went to mainstream schools, at Mthimkhulu Primary and Masithwalisane Secondary, in his kasi. After failing matric, Sibusiso worked for a cellular company as a Rica agent. While he was working, he met Vuyelwa Tizeka, who encouraged him to study business practice and IT through Thlevo Training Services. “I want to be an IT technician and work for a software company one day. Mayb, who knows, I might be the next Bill Gates,” said Sibusiso. He’s currently based at Mthimkhulu Primary School as part of a learnership programme. Sibusiso also recently became a hero in his kasi when he bought school uniforms for two pupils at Mthimkhulu Primary School with his grant money. “The one child’s uniform was torn and another one couldn’t afford a new one. I believe in doing well and that’s why I help where I can. The Bible says the hand that gives is the hand that receives.” Sibusiso said one of his difficulties is people who would cut him off when he tries to speak. “This is rude. People need to be educated about disability.” Sibusiso said he believed anyone could achieve their dreams, even if he or she had a disability.
