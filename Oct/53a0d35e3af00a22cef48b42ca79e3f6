POLICE Minister Bheki Cele said recently that at least 22 000 cars were stolen in Mzansi every year! He said most of the cars ended up in neighbouring countries. Now government has decided to stop the flow of stolen cars. Defence force soldiers are busting car thieves along the border. Army chief General Solly Shoke congratulated the soldiers yesterday for stopping six stolen vehicles at the border between Mzansi and Mozambique. “The defence force members from 9 South African Infantry Battalion, Bravo Company, at Macadamia Operational Base under Major Malebo Manganye, received a call from Tracker SA about possible stolen vehicles that were headed towards the border on Friday night. “Major Manganye activated the reaction force and they went to the a possible illegal border-crossing point used by vehicle smugglers,” he said. He said the troops seized a 2016 Ford Ranger worth R200 000 and a Toyota Hilux worth R350 000. Early on Monday morning a patrolling platoon from the same battalion noticed unusual vehicle movement from an observation post. Two members went to investigate and found a further six vehicles,” he said. Shoke said two vehicles managed to cross into Mozambique but the two soldiers stopped the remaining four vehicles. Three drivers fled on foot and crossed into Mozambique. One driver was caught at the scene. The four vehicles and the driver were handed over to Komatipoort cops.
