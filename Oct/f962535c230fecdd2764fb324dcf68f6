IT’S A FAMILY affair for the Mampofu
siblings, who are planning on taking show business by storm. Actors Oros,
Lunathi and Prince are climbing the ladder to the top and they are keeping it
in the family. Speaking to
Sun Buzz this week, the trio said they had formed their own company called The
Mampfu’s. “We basically identified an untapped marketing tool in the business,
so we decided to start a company that would cater to the needs of various
companies, both corporate and entertainment. We offer marketing strategies
through social media and other mediums. We’ll so produce television content,”
he said. He said
their plan has always been to build an empire as a family, so that they can
create a legacy that will last. Said Prince: “We’ve always wanted to start
something together as a family and this is a stepping stone for us to achieve
that dream we’ve always had of building an empire.” Although she
is the only woman in the business Lunathi said she is not intimidated, because
they all have a common goal and that is to see their brainchild succeed.  She said: “There are no egos here, we are here
for this same goal and that is to see our company grow into something beyond
our imagination. She said
they will use their different expertise to ensure that their company
flourishes. “We are from the same family, but we excel at different things,
which is good for the company, as we can use what we all know and have
experience in to drive the company forward,” she said.
