MAMELODI Sundowns have suffered a huge blow with the news that striker Sibusiso “Villa” Vilakazi has been ruled out for the remainder of the season. According to Downs’ official website, Vilakazi will be out of action for six months after he suffered a ruptured tendon while on national duty. The 28-year-old departed the Bafana Bafana camp prematurely last Wednesday after he left the pitch in pain during their friendly with SuperSport United. The star player missed Bafana’s 6-0 walloping of Seychelles in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at FNB Stadium on Saturday and the return match away yesterday. The Brazilians medical team confirmed that Villa has undergone successful surgery. His injury layoff is a big setback for Sundowns ahead of their Telkom Knockout clash with Bloemfontein Celtic at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (6pm). This also means Vilakazi will miss his side’s Caf Champions League campaign, the Nedbank Cup and their mission to defend the Absa Premiership title. Vilakazi featured in six of Downs’ first seven Absa Premiership games this season and opened his league account in the 3-3 draw with AmaZulu last month. The former Bidvest Wits star joins Aubrey Ngoma, George Lebese, Anthony Laffor, Thapelo Morena and Themba Zwane in the casualty room at Chloorkop.
