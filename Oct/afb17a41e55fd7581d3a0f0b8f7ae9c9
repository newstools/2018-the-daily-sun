LINDOKUHLE “Odwa” Makanda (24) does ballet for a living, which is unheard of in townships. “I want ballet to be as popular as soccer. People should be able to dance without being called names,” he said. “I was warned not to do ballet because I’d be seen as gay. I still see some of the people who said that, and I wonder what they think now that my career is blossoming.” Odwa, from Nyanga, Cape Town, encouraged parents to support their children’s career choice. “Parents force their children to pursue certain careers. I think kids have to follow their dreams instead of their parents’ wishes.” Odwa said he had been doing ballet since he was nine. He started when he was a pupil at Walter Teka Primary School. He said an organisation called Dance For All used to have dancing lessons in the school hall. “I was curious, so I stood on a chair and peeped through the hall window and watched them as they danced. “The teacher saw me and said I could join them. They were practising African dance routines at the time, but I was told they offered ballet lessons as well. “I was just satisfying my curiosity, because I didn’t think ballet was challenging. But I learnt new things every day and I liked the challenge.” Odwa’s talent has taken him overseas and puts food on his table. He has been to the US twice. Odwa has a diploma from the Cape Academy of Performing Arts. But ballet isn’t the only dance form he’s perfected. “It’s good to be versatile because sometimes if you only know one dance form, people don’t want to hire you. Most of the time, people want someone who is versatile and can bust many moves.”
