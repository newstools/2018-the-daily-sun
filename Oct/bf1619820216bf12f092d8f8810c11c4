WOMEN who might have been abused by Nigerian pastor Tim Omotoso (59) have been urged to come forward. The Commission for the Rights of Religious Communities made the call just as Omotoso, Zukiswa Sitho (28) and Lusanda Solani (36) are set to go to trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Monday on sexual assault charges. The three are facing 63 charges ranging from rape and human trafficking to racketeering. Omotoso, the senior pastor at Jesus Dominion International Church, was arrested by the Hawks at Port Elizabeth International Airport in April last year. He was denied bail twice after he was found to be a flight risk, while his co-accused were each released on bail of R2 000. The state alleges Sitho and Solani recruited girls at church crusades around the country and took them to Omotoso’s house in KZN, where they were kept. Some of the girls were aged as young as 13. The commission said they were happy that Omotoso would finally answer for his alleged crimes. Commission spokesman Mpiyakhe Mkholo said: “We call upon everyone who has been victimised by their religious leader to come out and report it to the commission and the police.” The trial is set to start on Monday before going on a break from Friday 14 December to Tuesday 1 January.
