ALBERTINA Sisulu’s life was celebrated at Cofimvaba Hospital on Tuesday. The event was organised by the department of communications and was held in Cofimvaba, where Sisulu was born. A number of mayors and regional ANC leaders attended the celebration, which was also an outreach event. Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane said: “Mama Sisulu was a nurse, so we saw fit to bring the Thuma Mina campaign to her birthplace. “We want to listen to what the people have to say and do what we can for them. “We are working with other government departments to ensure this hospital keeps Sisulu’s legacy alive.” Mokonyane said her department would upgrade the hospital’s communications system so people could call the dispensary to collect their medicine. “We will also install TVs in hospital wards so patients, especially children, can be entertained while they’re recovering. She loved children a lot. “We want to make sure quality healthcare reaches all the communities around the hospital.” Resident Nowezile Fongoqa (98), who grew up with Sisulu, remembered her as a neat, beautiful and educated woman. “She contributed to the development that is taking place in Xolobe,” said gogo Nowezile. “Young people regard her as a role model. “She taught me how to count and, thanks to her, no one can rob me of my pension money.”
