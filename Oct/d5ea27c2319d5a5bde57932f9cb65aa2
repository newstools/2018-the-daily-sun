BEWARE of scammers! If the City of Ekurhuleni sends a message informing you that a vacancy you applied for has become available, it might very well be a hoax. Nombeko Dubazana (45) said her daughter received an SMS about a job, but was required to pay a fee. “She was desperate as she had applied at many places. Luckily, I suspected the SMS might be a scam,” said Nombeko. She said a friend who works at the municipality told her the city wasn’t hiring at the moment. Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said the city found out about the scam last week. “Residents are urged not to reply to the SMS,” he said. Gadebe saidthe city’s recruitment system sends an e-mail to candidates notifying them of the status of their application. He said the also called applicants. He said no one come forward to report scammers. However the city received enquiries from people who were suspicious of SMSes informing them they had passed certain stages of the recruitment process.
