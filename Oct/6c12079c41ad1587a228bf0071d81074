THE Toyota plant in Prospecton, south of Durban, came to a standstill yesterday when workers aligned to Numsa protested outside the premises. According to Sihle Dlamini, the union’s chairman at the plant, they went on strike after about 550 temporary workers were suspended last February. “These employees were promised they would be called back to work when the level of car sales went up,” said Dlamini. “But when that took place in June this year, that never happened.” He said employees were also not happy with the R10 000 the employer allegedly gave them last year following floods in KZN. “The employer gave the employees this money as a form of support,” he said. “The employer never said the company was going to recover the money in instalments.” After several unanswered phone calls, senior manager Andrew Maluleka said he had forwarded the inquiry to another senior manager, Jenny Mare. He said Mare had requested for the email address where the response would be sent. But the SunTeam had not received comment at the time of going to print.
