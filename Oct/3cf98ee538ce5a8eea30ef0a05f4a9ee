Rapper, Riky Rick has expressed some pretty personal views on violence in South Africa. In the wake of the violent protests that have erupted in Westbury, Johannesburg, Riky has weighed in on the discussions. A 45-year-old woman was killed and a 10-year-old girl injured last week when a shootout ensued in Westbury. Residents of the area have since taken to the street in protest of violence and drug abuse in their community. They are calling on the government to deploy the army or police to help calm things down. In the midst of all of this, Riky finds the whole a very sad situation. “Tired of black people killing other black people. Let’s stop that s@#*. We been through enough already. It’s enough,” he said.
