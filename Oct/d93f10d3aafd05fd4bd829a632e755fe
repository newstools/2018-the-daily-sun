WESTERN Cape Education MEC Debbie Schafer and Transport MEC Donald Grant are calling on taxi associations, bus operators and Metrorail for help. They want them to go out of their way to help matric pupils get to exam venues on time. There is a transport crisis in the province, with train arson attacks and the MyCiTi bus drivers’protest in Cape Town. The MECs said: “Many candidates rely only on public transport. With reports of Metrorail trains delayed, cancelled or set alight, there is a possibility they will not reach their exam venues on time.” Congress for Democratic Taxi Associations spokesman Besuthu Ndungane told Daily Sun they are ready to work with government but haven’t received any communication. “We are practical when it comes to solving people’s challenges but when they want us to intervene, they have to approach us and not let us know through newspapers.” He said as taxi operators, they will continue their jobs as they have been doing all along. Meanwhile, the MyCiTi bus drivers’ protest continued for a third day, leaving commuters stranded. Drivers won’t go back to work until their demands are taken seriously. Zandile Tunani (18), who travels to school from Langa to Maitland, said: “I use trains but they are not reliable so I asked the parents of my friend in Kensington if I can sleep over when I have an exam. “I can’t take a taxi every day because my single mum doesn’t have enough money.” Schafer said: “Public transport can be unreliable and matrics must ensure they leave home early to make up for delays.”
