THE remains of his wife and three children are still in the mortuary. Zibele Mjila needs help to do DNA tests to prove the bodies are those of his family members. No one knows what started the fire that took the lives of Nomsa Dyantyi (38) and her three children, Vuyani (10), Neliswa (7) and Aphelele (4) on 17 September. Daily Sun published the sad story on 19 September. Zibele said police were taking too long to release the bodies. The father from Tshatshalaza squatter camp in Browns Farm, close to Cape Town, said he wanted to give his family a dignified send-off. “I am hurting and I don’t know where to go for help. I do not have money to pay a private pathologist to do the DNA tests so the bodies can be released,” he told Daily Sun. He said he was told it could take up to six months before the DNA tests could be done. “Their spirits are not resting and if I wait too long, they might come to haunt me,” said Zibele. Community leader Thozamile Liwani said the community was also concerned. “We are worried about Zibele. He is traumatised by this. “We don’t know where to go for funds so we can help him,” said Thozamile. Sanco member Ntomboxolo Gweba said the government should intervene. “Taxi drivers assisted with food but our leaders are silent and they are aware of the issue. “It is painful that people come to us for help but we can’t help,” said Ntomboxolo. Zibele told the People’s Paper all he wants was for his family to rest in peace. “They died a painful death and their spirits are not resting. “I want to take them home to the Eastern Cape where our relatives are resting. I need help,” he said.
