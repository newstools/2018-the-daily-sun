A video footage showing someone believed to be a "drunk" EFF leader
Julius Malema has
surfaced on social media. In the video, Malema or his lookalike, is seen in the VIP
section of an unknown club, struggling to stand straight after "having a few drinks". But some Twitter users said it can’t be Julius since well
Julius doesn’t drink alcohol. Others said that even if it’s him there’s nothing wrong
there. “Being drunk is not wrong when u not working.” @MacKalima Tweeted: "You guys are making it
difficult for us ground forces to campaign. I am seeing your video where you
drunk. Guys get your act together ........... you are worrying."
