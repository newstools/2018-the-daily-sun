THE police have opened two cases of murder following the discovery of the decomposing bodies of two children in the veld. The bodies were found in Dobsonville, behind the Slovoville Cemetery in Soweto. The bodies were allegedly found by a passerby on Monday. According to police spokesman Kay Makhubele, the bodies of the unidentified boy and girl, who are suspected to be aged between 10 and 11, were found buried in a single shallow grave, blindfolded, and with their hands tied. At this stage, no cases of missing children have been reported at any of the police stations in the Soweto West cluster. “The possibility that the children could have been reported missing outside of the cluster can’t be ruled out,” said Makhubele. He said the police were appealing for any information from members of the public who knew of two children, a boy and girl, who had gone missing. He said they needed help with the identification of the victims and ultimately, to catch the suspects. “In line with the national instruction to prioritise cases against women and children, the police will leave no stone unturned. We will ensure the perpetrators of this crime against children are found to face justice,” Makhubele said.
