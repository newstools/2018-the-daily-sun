A WIDOW’S pain is helping artists reach their goals. Angelina de Wee (38) from Botshabelo section N in Mangaung, Free State never dreamt of being a writer. Her journey as a writer started after her husband was killed in a car accident. “The sudden loss came as a shock,” said Angelina. “During my healing process and recovery from depression, my psychiatrist told me that I was a writer. She said she picked this up from my journals. “I didn’t take it lightly.” Angelina said she was then introduced to Dr Roseline Sebolao, who became her mentor until she published her first book, Tseba O Leetong. Artistic development is very close to Angelina’s heart and she has conducted a number of workshops. “We have expanded to modelling, film and TV production, playwriting, dance and many other things,” she said. Angelina empowered herself by attending several business seminars and workshops. “After gaining knowledge, I registered my company, De Wee Production, which is named after my late husband,” she said. The company provides artist and events management, marketing and other services to promote talent. Earlier this year, her 13-year-old son Kamogelo published his first children’s book with her help. Angelina also has Bennet Mkhehlane under her wing. He is a motivational speaker, businessman and author.
