A TAXI boss is living in fear after two fellow taxi owners were shot dead by unknown gunmen. The taximan from Umlazi, south of Durban, and the victims were sitting inside a car at KwaMnyandu Mall shortly before the shooting happened last Monday. The 35-year-old taximan belongs to the same Isipingo Taxi Association that Senzo Luthuli (37) and Nqaba Mbhele (40) were members of. He told Daily Sun: “It’s hard to run away from people I don’t know. “I don’t feel safe, but I can’t hide when I don’t know who and where they are.” He said he has been receiving death threats from unknown callers. On the day of the apparent hit, he was walking towards the car from the shops when he saw people running in all directions. He said he did not know what the gunmen’s motive was for killing Luthuli and Mbhele. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the two victims sustained multiple gunshot wounds. “The motive for their killing is unknown at this stage, but we’re investigating,” said Zwane.
