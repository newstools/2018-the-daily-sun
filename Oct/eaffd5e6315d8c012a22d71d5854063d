OPPOSITION parties have slammed the Ndwedwe Municipality, north of Durban, for allegedly dressing the local choir in ANC colours. The municipality sponsored the Ndwedwe Choral Society during the Old Mutual National Choir Festival in Durban last Sunday. After the choir had won, municipal officials posted the pictures on Facebook, but this led to people questioning their choice of colours. EFF councillor Sabelo Hlophe yesterday demanded an explanation and said officials who paid for the uniforms should pay back the money. He accused them of using money meant for campaigns. “We were told the municipality would sponsor the Ndwedwe Choral Society choir, not the ANC choir. We want all the money used to be paid back.” He said it was an insult to Ndwedwe residents that the choir represented them. He would ask why judges had allowed the party to campaign. The IFP also expressed shock over the “ANC choir”. Municipal whip Mzwelanga Sishi said they would demand answers from the speaker. Municipal spokeswoman Thobile Nxumalo denied the municipality paid for the uniforms, saying it only supported them with transport.
