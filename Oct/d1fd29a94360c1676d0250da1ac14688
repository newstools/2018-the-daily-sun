THATO Sekoane’s love of baking was inspired by his friend who owns a confectionery business. Thato (30), owner of Jomo’s Cakes in Mapetla, Soweto, turned his hobby into a passion. “Initially, I owned a car wash and was known for it. I soon realised I could be making extra cash selling cakes and cool drinks while people waited for their cars to be washed,” said Thato. He says he started baking cakes and sold them from his mum’s dining-room in 2016. This angered her a lot. “You know how mothers are with their dining-room suites. But I convinced her I was serious about my business and asked her to allow me to save money to build a small bakery.” According to Thato, after hard work, he had saved enough to build a garage that he uses as his bakery. “I was happy to see the structure complete. I filled it up with all the equipment to make my baking business a success. Thanks to my friend for sharing his skill with me” Thato said his car wash suffered as a result of him being too busy with baking. Thato’s business has created employment for seven people who have just completed matric. “Although my car wash ended up failing because baking consumed all my time, it left me with loyal customers,” he said. Two of them bake while the others handle deliveries to the SABC, CCMA and Old Mutual offices. Thato also does orders for weddings, funerals and parties. I’m enjoying what I do and glad that I can give young people who have lost hope a chance of learning about business and being your own boss,” said Thato.
