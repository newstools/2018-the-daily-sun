The saying that the apple does not fall far from the tree is true for Luvo Khwehla (21) and Sandile Mabece (48) from Makhaza, in Cape Town. Both father and son are artists who are very good at what they do. Sandile said he liked drawing from a young age but at his school, art was not taught. “I did biology and the teachers would always ask me to draw the diagram from the textbook on the board since we didn’t have enough textbooks. They told me I was very good,” said Sandile. After completing matric, he looked for a job to fund his graphic design studies. The father of three now teaches visual arts at a high school. Luvo said he was inspired by his father to start drawing but his father would often not draw for him. “I watched him and would try to imitate him. I became better and better and eventually I was drawing like him,” said Luvo. He said it was easy to get his family’s support for his art since his father was in the same field. Luvo is now a second-year art student and uses his home for art exhibitions. “The plan is to have my own studio here in Makhaza and attract tourists to come here for exhibitions,” said Luvo. He believes people do not see the value in paintings. “They want drawings for free or say the paintings are expensive,” said Luvo. Although they never compete with each other, Sandile believes a student cannot beat his master.
