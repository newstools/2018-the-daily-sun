UNIVERSITY of Pretoria midfielder Clifford Ngobeni says they are prepared for war this season and on a mission to return to the Absa Premiership. AmaTuks are in their third season in the National First Division (NFD) since getting relegated at the end of the 2015-16 campaign. Like all the other teams in the league, they are eyeing the main prize, winning automatic promotion at the end of the campaign. But their last two spells were not promising at all, as they failed to even make the play-offs under Shaun Bartlett, who was replaced by Evangelos Vellios at the beginning of the season. However, veteran midfielder Ngobeni who is in his second stint in the NFD with the club, believes a ruthless approach this season could be key. “Getting as many points as we can will be key. I know all teams are saying this but the difference is how you get those points,” said the former Orlando Pirates and Mpumalanga Black Aces player. AmaTuks have an tough assignment on Sunday when they visit seasoned campaigners Jomo Cosmos at Vosloorus Stadium (3.30pm). Ngobeni says they know what they are up against and are ready for war. “It will be war, it does not matter how we get the points, but we have to get all of them. In the NFD, most of the time fancy football does not benefit you. “We had a fair start to the season but it’s never perfect, we still need to improve and work hard.” Seven games into the season, AmaTuks and Cosmos are tied on 12 points in fifth and sixth place in the table. They are two points adrift of log leaders TS Sporting who have 14 points.
