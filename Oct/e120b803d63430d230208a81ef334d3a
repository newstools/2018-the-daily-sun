VUSI Nova’s hit song Asiphelelanga  is trending on social media and getting a lot of airplay on various radio stations. But the song has left maskandi fans angry. The song, featuring poet Jessica Mbangeni, pays tribute to Mzansi artists who have died. Vusi mentions the names of artists like Robbie Malinga, Miriam Makeba, Brenda Fassie, Mandoza, Sfiso Ncwane, Nana Coyote, Busi Mhlongo, Lucky Dube and Ray Phiri. But he doesn’t mention any maskandi artist. This angered maskandi fans, who took to Facebook to lash Nova. The fans have called on Nova to go back to studio to re-arrange it. They said he should sure that maskandi artists such as Mgqumeni, Mtshengiseni, Mjikijelwa, Bhekumuzi Luthuli, Sandile Mbongwa, Mfazomnyama, Mahawukela Mseleku and others. Maskandi fan Makhosonke Mahlambi said: “Vusi Nova, I know you are here with your manager. We want you to record a song that will include all the maskandi artists.” MP Mkhize said that: “I don’t want to lie. I didn’t like it when Vusi Nova didn’t mention maskandi artists on his song. He showed that he undermines our music.” Vusi said he was aware that maskandi fans were unhappy. “This is weird and ridiculous. People should listen carefully to the song. I only mentioned people who I grew up listening to. These are people who inspired me to be where I am today. Listen carefully to the song. There’s a part where I say I can’t mention all of them,” said Vusi.
