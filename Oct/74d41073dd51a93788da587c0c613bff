A BULLDOG reportedly put a man in
hospital after it bit off his 4-5. Emergency services found him out and
cold in a pool of blood. It is alleged that he lost his
penis and both testicles. The incident reportedly happened in
Haddington's High Street in East Lothian. According to the Daily Mail, the
22-year-old was taken to Edinburgh Royal Hospital, where he was induced into a
coma. An investigation is currently
underway as how the incident occurred. It is not known whether the dog
belonged to him or not. Bulldogs were popular up until the
19th century at the peak of bull baiting and had previously been used by
butchers to immobilise the animals so they could be slaughtered. The original Old English Bulldog
breed, historically popular for bull baiting, is extinct. They were used for blood sport but
declined in number along with the fall in popularity of bull baiting after the
Cruelty to Animals Act was passed in 1835.
