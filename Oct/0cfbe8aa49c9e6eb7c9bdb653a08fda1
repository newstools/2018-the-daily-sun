YOU need to check a used motorcycle before handing over the money. Paintwork: Check all painted parts carefully. Look for rust on metal parts and cracks in plastic items. Side panels may be missing mounting lugs. Wheels and tyres: Check for loose spokes as well as buckled or damaged wheels. The rims should be free of corrosion. Check the tread wear on the tyres. Wheel bearings: Grasp the tyre and try to rock the wheel side to side. Too much “play” is an indication that the bike has been neglected. Brakes: Brake discs can score badly and are expensive to replace. It’s important you also check for cracks and determine the remaining life of the brake pads. Forks: Check that the fork is straight and moves freely at the head bearings without leaking. Even a slightly bent fork could indicate damage. Look for pitting at the fork arms or stanchions as well as split boots and accordion-tube gaiters. Rear suspension: Inspect the suspension as you do the forks. You should make sure there’s plenty of damping. Chains and sprockets: A loose chain is not always a worn one. If the chain lifts off the rear sprocket and exposes the teeth you’ll need a new chain and sprockets. Exhaust: Exhausts always show signs of a tumble, no matter how slight. Beware of after-market silencers unless it is of top quality, such as Yoshimura. Seat: Check the seat’s frame or pan for rot, especially around the hinges. Electronics: Indicators should flash even at low revs if the battery is good. Does the wiring harness show tampering or cracks in the headstock area?
