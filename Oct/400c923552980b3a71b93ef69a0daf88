IT’S democracy – on steroids! Residents of the Marquassi Hills local municipality are not going to wait for elections to come around again – they want their mayor out right now. The angry residents marched peacefully from the local township to Wolmaranstad in North West, carrying placards announcing that the mayor must fall! They accused the mayor, Noni Kgabi, of employing family members, misuse of her municipal vehicle and resources, lack of leadership and service delivery, and corruption. Reading the community’s memorandum, Doctor Mohadi said the premier’s office should fire the mayor within seven days otherwise the community would embark on a protest to ensure their wishes are granted. Other mayors have been removed, they said, so they want to see the back of Kgabi. Mohadi said: “Where in this municipality can you walk without having to manoeuvre your way around sewer spillage? “People in some areas get mugged because of a lack of electricity. Scarcity of water is another problem. No refuse collection is yet another.” Nomthandazo Nobatana, who received the memorandum on behalf of the North West premier, promised to take it to the Minister of Co-operative Governance, the premier and the municipality for a response.
