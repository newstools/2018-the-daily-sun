MPHANGELI Muncu amassed a lot of debt to feed his alcohol addiction. But when the-45-year-old from Bergman in Mangaung, realised how much debt he was in, he hanged himself with an electrical cable on Saturday morning. His wife Miselwa Muncu (40) said what her husband did wasn’t right because she had to settle his debt. “We were happy when we ate supper together on Friday night. “I was so shocked when my son ran into my room, telling me his father was dead. “I jumped out of bed because I didn’t believe what he was saying. “When I opened the door, I found him hanging from the roof. “I don’t know why he decided to kill himself because life is full of debt.” Miselwa said her husband drank almost every day. “I tried to convince him to stop but he didn’t listen. “He used his money to buy alcohol and never brought any of that cash home. “Sometimes he didn’t want to go to work because he was scared of the people he owed. “He left me with four kids and I’m unemployed. “I don’t know how I’m going to raise my children.” Mphangeli’s friend said: “We were drinking together on Friday and he gave us money. “We were so surprised when he took out hundred rand notes. “I refused to take his money but he forced me to. “I didn’t know it was his way of saying goodbye.” Police spokesman Constable Peter Kareli said an inquest case was opened.
