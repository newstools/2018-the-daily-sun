SEVERAL scholar transport buses were impounded in Mkhuhlu, Mpumalanga, on Thursday. According to the department, the buses did not comply with transport regulations. The Department of Education has assured the public that nothing will interfere with pupils’ travelling schedule. “We welcome the operation because it intends to ensure the safety of pupils,” said education spokesman Jasper Zwane. He insisted that it won’t affect the pupils. Transport MEC Gillion Mashego said the buses were impounded during a scholar transport monitoring operation. The operation was conducted as part of the Transport Month programme. He said the buses had the potential of causing accidents and endangering pupils’ lives. Transport inspectors had previously scrapped another bus operating in the same area. The MEC, accompanied by transport inspectors, will visit various districts across the province to inspect public and scholar transport. “Never from the conscience of my heart will I turn a blind eye and expose our pupils to unnecessary potential accidents,” Mashego told the People’s Paper. “I’ve already instructed the service provider to make another provision so that pupils aren’t affected.”
