RESIDENTS of Engonyameni Village outside Umlazi, south of Durban, have shut down several schools in the area. The residents have been protesting for water since last week, when they stormed schools and ordered pupils and teachers to join them. KZN Education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa told Daily Sun they were concerned the protest would affect schools at a crucial time, when pupils were meant to prepare for their final exams. He said all matric pupils would sit their English paper on Tuesday. “We have been informed by our district officials that many schools in ward 100 of eThekwini Municipality, which includes areas of Engonyameni and parts of Umbumbulu, were forced to close. “We would like to appeal to protesters to let schools function in the interests of the kids’ future. “As much as we understand that they have a right to protest, closing schools was totally wrong and unacceptable,” said Mlotshwa. One of school principals said he feared if the protest wasn’t resolved this week, pupils wouldn’t be able to write exams next week. Residents said they held a meeting with Councillor Mbuyiseni Mkhize on Sunday. They said when he couldn’t tell them why their taps were dry, they decided to close all the schools. Last week residents went on the rampage and allegedly burned a grader belonging to a contractor that was fixing access roads. They also burned the traditional court. Councillor Mkhize said water would be restored today. He said plumbers had gone to the area with a police escort yesterday to fix the damaged pipes.
