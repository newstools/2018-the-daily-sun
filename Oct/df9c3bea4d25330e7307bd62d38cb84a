COMMUTERS in Cape Town are caught between a rock and a hard place due to taxi fare hikes. And railway services have been disrupted by trains being vandalised. Nobuhle Jalamba (40) from Goodwood said she was shocked when she had to pay R15 for a taxi trip yesterday. She said a trip from Cape Town to Goodwood used to cost R11,50. “The increase has messed up my budget. I can’t rely on trains anymore because I received a final warning at work for always being late,” she said. “My friend paid R10 for the same trip that day.” South Africa National Taxi Council spokesman Thabisho Molelekwa said some associations were still in the process of rolling out the increases announced in August. “The increases will only last until June. Then we will review them, but another increase might be announced,” said Molelekwa. Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott said the company was doing its best to keep trains running. She applauded Metrorail’s technical team for fixing three trains that were burnt on Friday.
