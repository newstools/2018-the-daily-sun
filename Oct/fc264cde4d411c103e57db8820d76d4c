UNIVERSITY of Joburg student Bongani Senne has received an Iconic Award for helping those who cannot help themselves. The award is given to students for the work they do in society. The 23-year-old from Tshwane received the recognition for transformation and social justice in September after university students and staff voted for him. Bongani is the chairman of campus programme Remember and Give, which provides food for struggling students. He told the People’s Paper he saw a need to help students, as many of them were his friends. He partnered with social groups and his work was recognised by social organisation Lead SA. Other institutions have also recognised Bongani for his charitable work. Last month, he was part of a Casual Day initiative in which he and university departments collected R5 600 for people living with disabilities. The third-year logistics student said he can’t bear to see people suffer. “When I came to university, I wanted to stand for something bigger than myself. “The award motivated me to go out there and do good for the simple desire to do so.” Bongani said it was important to motivate others. “People out there do charitable deeds because they want to be seen as good or want recognition. “But it’ a good thing not only to live for yourself but for others.”
