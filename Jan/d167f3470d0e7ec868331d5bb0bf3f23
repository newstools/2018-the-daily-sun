Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has put some
of the blame on former South African Social Security Agency CEO Thokozani
Magwaza for the social security agency grant scandal that has landed her in the
hot seat.Dlamini on Wednesday faced her third day of gruelling
cross-examination.She was testifying at the Office of the Chief Justice in
Midrand, north of Gauteng, at an inquiry into her role and liability in the
2017 social grant crisis.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The Constitutional Court had appointed retired Judge Bernard
Ngoepe to investigate whether Dlamini should be held personally accountable for
costs incurred in the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) payment
scandal.Dlamini, during cross-examination by Magwaza's lawyer,
Advocate Richard Solomon, suggested that Magwaza lied in his submissions that
she was in charge of workstreams that have come under scrutiny in the inquiry."There are documents that are signed by Magwaza and I
don't understand why all the blame is shifted to me regarding everything that
happened," she said.Dlamini accused of deceiving courtThe inquiry is investigating whether Dlamini sought the
appointment of individuals to the three workstreams which would directly report
to her.The Constitutional Court found that the appointment of
leaders of the workstreams who had acted as advisers for Dlamini was irregular
and illegal.The inquiry will also investigate the appointment terms of
the individuals, who they reported to and the workstreams reports.Magwaza, who is a witness in the inquiry, inhis submission
accused Dlamini of deceiving the Constitutional Court.He alleges that Dlamini appointed leaders of the workstreams
and that the teams reported to her.Dlamini, however, has denied this in her defiant testimony
during cross-examination, saying that Magwaza did not only "fail to engage
comprehensively" but "it was only after Magwaza had been appointed
that problems started happening with work unable to flow".Defiant DlaminiShe also denied Magwaza's claims that he had been left in
the dark on the reports of the workstreams."It's not true that there was anyone blank with what
was happening. How would I have ever said that the CEO must not get involved
with workstreams?" she added.Â Ngoepe cautioned Dlamini, once again, against dodging
questions.During cross-examination, Dlamini showed frustration with
the cross-examiners.In one instance, she refused to answer a question.On Tuesday, Ngoepe, on several occasions, reprimanded
Dlamini when she seemingly attempted to dodge questions.Ngoepe, in one such instance, insisted that Dlamini answer a
question. However, a defiant Dlamini stuck to her guns and refused to respond.Cross-examination will continue on Thursday.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/i-dont-understand-why-the-blame-is-shifted-onto-me-dlamini-blames-former-sassa-ceo-in-payment-scandal-20180124
