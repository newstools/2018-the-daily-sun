be fired.”As a result, Koko filed an urgent court interdict with the
Labour Court on Friday. Phasiwe said the matter was due to be heard on Monday,
but might be scheduled as early as Friday evening.This follows Koko's testimony at the inquiry into corruption
and the capture of Eskom on Tuesday, and the management shake-up by government
last Saturday.The government appointed a new 13-member board, with the
respected Jabu Mabuza as the new chairperson and Hadebe as the new interim CEO.
The government also demanded that the board remove all executives who face
allegations of corruption, including then chief financial officer Anoj Singh
and Koko, who was recently reinstated after being cleared of any wrongdoing.On Wednesday Fin24 reported that Koko was refusing to resign
from the power utility, saying he believes he still has a crucial role to play
at Eskom.In a letter to Eskom board member Malegapuru Makgoba, he
said Eskom’s lenders have been unfairly demanding his dismissal.Koko also sent a lawyer’s letter to former interim Eskom
boss Sean Maritz on Monday, in which he stated that if Eskom wants to dismiss
him, it must follow the letter of the law. He was grilled by the parliamentary
inquiry into state capture at Eskom on Wednesday.On Monday last week Koko returned to his job at the power
utility as Eskom group executive for generation.Koko was of the view that several public statements from
Eskom and the government, as well as electronic correspondence from Eskom board
members urging him to resign, amount to bullying.He also took issue with a statement emanating from the Presidency
on Saturday, where Eskom's new board was directed "to immediately remove
all Eskom executives who are facing allegations of serious corruption and other
acts of impropriety, including Matshela Koko and Mr Anoj Singh".Singh resigned on Monday evening, with another Eskom
executive, Prish Govender, following suit. But Koko's lawyers say he is going
nowhere, and that the statement from the Presidency amounts to unlawful
interference in Eskom's internal workings. 
Koko’s lawyers added that the call for him to resign “on the
basis of patriotism” was unfortunate.https://www.fin24.com/Economy/Eskom/koko-ignores-ultimatum-to-resign-takes-eskom-board-to-labour-court-20180126
