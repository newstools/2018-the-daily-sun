Useless staff were employed. Service providers took over responsibilities that could have gone to competent staff.”Municipal spokeswoman Beauty Makganye said claims that people without qualifications were given jobs were untrue.“Positions are advertised and people apply. Qualifications are looked into and a relevant recruitment process takes place. Candidates are shortlisted after interviews,” she said.
