Jesusbaby said he started singing in church at the age of seven. He moved to Joburg in 2005 to study but ended up joining a choir, which he stayed with for eight years. In 2010, the choir came second in a competition to write a new jingle for the painkiller Anadin. “We came second out of 120 groups. Our jingle was played on national radio stations,” he said. In 2011, Jesusbaby’s pastor Edson Sadialunda helped him release a debut album called Sing Glory, but it didn’t sell well. Jesusbaby later released a second album and won an award at the Gauteng Gospel Music Awards for his praise song Ufanelwe Ukubongwa. Customer Agnes January (31) said Jesusbaby’s singing was so good that she bought milk there just to hear him. Garage manager James Mukwawaya (34) said: “Jesusbaby is unique and amazing.”
