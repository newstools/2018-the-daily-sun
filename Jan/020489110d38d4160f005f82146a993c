waking up to a man having sex with me."Too ashamed over how much I had drank and not being
able to remember how we ended up in bed, I didn't tell anyone. Gathered my
things, even thanked him for a fun night and ran."I felt that my reputation as a party girl cancelled
out my ability to be a victim. How stupid is that? So I find the spotlight on
consent a much needed one."Besides the importance of consent, Constance also wants
to highlight the importance of respect in sexual relations."I come from an area where the 'cool guys' would
sleep with anyone," she writes."I remember two of them had a
threesome with a girl they had no respect for, who thought doing what they
asked would give her a little bit of the 'special' that these boys appeared to
ooze, or put her in that circle of golden boys who seemed to be at the centre
of everything."I understood that, I had fallen for it too at
times."But it didn't, they told everyone every detail and
never spoke to her again. Yes there was consent to that threesome, but there
was no respect at all."Constance has nearly 1,2 million followers and is known
for her spicy views on raising kids and saying things just as she sees them.
