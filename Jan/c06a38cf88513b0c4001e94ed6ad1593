WILL Baroka FC complete the double over Kaizer Chiefs or will the Soweto giants record their first competitive victory over the Limpopo-based outfit?These are some of the questions football fans will be asking ahead of the two teams’ Absa Premiership encounter at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday afternoon, (3.30pm). Bakgaga are unbeaten against Amakhosi in the league since they were promoted to the top flight division two seasons ago. The Polokwane-based outfit registered two victories – one in the league and another in a cup competition, with their other two league matches ending in stalemate. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssbOlWWBYmkY4A20q-mWZ2NKfw0nwCUL3OT3eru3UqjbtB-NNmFYz8FsmIawFzm1nqeH5a-g-3CH9SHiAr1KVmJQPer83rGBf94fcGMqm0WX5rXasIrRAsomENQZOkN5Qa4JPeqRXeoA3XDMpqPZ1chEB7MUIwdMUTJpyliab_KdPHDRXMyoiodCYDVS83CFg_wrLO7lon02BCMTom0W30_qAKz0NAWuT8s2vP1kVN5CFx9hV4Ppjxub17azzo6t2ruDlRU6VXX6QIA--sll1y_kg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBktS1AbsYIKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

On paper this match promises goals as both teams will look to climb higher up the table. Bakgaga will pin their hopes on the likes of Gift Motupa and Mduduzi Mdantsane., who were both on the score sheet when their team brushed aside Usuthu to collect the maximum points in their past match. Amakhosi will look to the experience of Siphiwe Tshabalala and youngsters Ryan Moon and Dumisani Zuma, who found the back of the net in the win against Polokwane City in their previous match.
