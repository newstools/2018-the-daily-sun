Not only are we playing for three points, but there is also bragging rights. This time around it will be tough, exciting and lots of goals. I hope we get three points.” But Tshakuma head coach, Chokoe, is optimistic they will romp victorious: “The spirit is high following our 2-0 win against Stellenbosch. The fans will surely get their money’s worth.” Chokoe said fact that Masutha left them during the festive holidays to join Leopards counts for nothing. Leopards won 4-0 against Pretoria University FC last week, which is a mental boost too. Meanwhile, Tshakhuma received good news yesterday after the PSL found Mbombela United guilty of fielding a suspended player, Mxolisi Mayongo, in their league clash in November last year.United won the clash 3-0, but PSL fined them R50 000 (R25 000 which is suspended) and docked three points and handed to Tshakhuma. This would mean Tshakuma move to fourth spot on the log with 26 points from 16 games.Lidoda Duvha are eighth with 21 points. Chokoe will be relying on the experience of his captain  David Mathebula while Leopards will pin hopes on Ivan Mahangwahaya.
