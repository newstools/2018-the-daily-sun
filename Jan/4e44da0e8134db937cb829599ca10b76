    PENSIONER John Mosoma is worried his daughter Dineo (18) will join the long list of matriculants sitting at home because they don’t have money to further their studies. Dineo, from Shatale Village outside Bushbuckridge, was recognised as one of the top achievers in Mpumalanga at the 2017 matric results announcement, with seven distinctions from the eight subjects she wrote.Her older sister and brother, who passed matric in 2015 and 2016, still have not entered university or found jobs. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst0cHpyR_fuEJb82z8x5j5yWeank5HX3w39elCvRWIsiuPf8g7qUfz379QdR_taecXVUPknn-NW9EpEGupDAoT2Cw2t0iBn_Jf-Qnko83FzKpRVwKCzVO3q0_E1PMP4ZDj3Um-OHiEjlDEV4PRianN4j4mJTz8wTbr9npfdpbSviI99IeuPKf5N3LDQK_c2R0QXgl6c_1vVyHF8H555AQp3PKOeVHYCvwO0qcLXZ9QxaYNQfgOwkfF5lh5GSRZmRgJMNBWMGyTPlOuqzI0DhBg4ybLTAEI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGL_daQcouAtEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Dineo intends to study metallurgical engineering and said she’s already been accepted by the universities of Joburg, Wits and Pretoria. Her choice of university will be informed by costs and how her education will be funded. John said all he wants is for his daughter to be registered. “Once she’s in the system I can try to make all sorts of plans to see her through. “It won’t be the first time. “I did it with her two brothers, although in their case there were government bursaries and I only had to pay for their accommodation. But you can imagine how difficult it is having to do all that on my grant.” The provincial government has announced it is giving full bursaries to top achievers, but John said Dineo had not received confirmation yet. She will continue to apply to public and private institutions and will take whatever comes first.Three other children in the family are currently studying at Lehlasedi High School, a no-fee school in Shatale A, where Dineo wrote her matric.
