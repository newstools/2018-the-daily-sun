WE all need to deal with the tough economy but what the Khayelitsha Men’s Burial and Investment Club aim to do is create jobs.The 21-month-old society is working against the clock to raise more capital and start a viable business. The business will go a long way to help some long unemployed members get jobs.Each of the club’s 15 members contribute R250 each in the first week of every month. When they reach their target goal, they will have the funds they need to start the business. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuklQ9erPFkJx1VEwy9YvTtNlP72kx4CCrve07y_X56fPwAs94-l0_k5cbC1gNzlqatpfZsGEbD-APM0OGoSJTYaVr7E8hsFF3-DjcF7bt6wwV6APn4H5t2qJ_4odm6xpnWKllrOYrlNpDL7Q1Y5U_H3Mc1bfmOQ9iwKMytM9EIyI-yDzRYQtzS8YXzuRe2Q6MODIO95_bk5SQ9XHYse41IgWeawwRsZFW4InRmMF1RNxzou2hIS9L-w_bG-aGjr0uzgHGMFJHzJwb4icK_IqACpMGQrhk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLqk6Vrv2vRfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

While the men focus on saving capital, the women contribute R100 each for burials Deputy chairman of Khayelitsha Men’s, Peter Molefe, told SunStokvel: “Khayelitsha Women’s now has 10 members. We encouraged our wives to start the society which focuses on burials while we focus on business. “But five of wives did not show an interest in joining.“We did not want to force them into joining as we understand that some of them have other things to do at home.”
