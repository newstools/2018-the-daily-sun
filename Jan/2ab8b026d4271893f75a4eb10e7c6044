The city this week said contracts had expired and it would run a lottery for new beneficiaries.On Monday angry axed workers torched a municipal depot in Mabopane.A massive protest is planned for tomorrow, when thousands are expected to shut down the city, demanding reinstatement of the fired workers.Briefing the media yesterday at Tshwane House, Msimanga said it was unfortunate that he had received threats on Facebook from a well-known ANC youth leader.The threats came after a man commented on the mayor’s Facebook post: “Solly, former Mamelodi beauty king, we are coming 4 you... bloody die, white puppet.”ANCYL Tshwane spokesman Nicholas Gongolo Munyai said the post was a figure of speech and not a death threat.
