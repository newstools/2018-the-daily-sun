We have no peace at home. There is no escape,” she said.“We spend all our money on flytraps and taking the children to clinics and doctors for medical attention.”Anna said the problem started as long as 15 years ago when people started keeping cows and other livestock across the street from where they live. “Before the kraals were erected across the road we were happy, but now all that is gone. The little children don’t even know a life without flies,” she said. “When we start the cooking we close all the doors and windows but we still end up with flies on our food. And the can’t be scared away. That’s why we started covering ourselves with curtains.”She said the whole neighbourhood is speaking to the ward councillor and the authorities about removing the kraal but their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. “We have knocked on many doors to have the livestock removed and have run out of ideas.” Sibusiso Mabena (36) said his dream was to move to an area where he doesn’t have to live with a swarm of flies buzzing around his head. “We live like pigs. My friends have stopped visiting me because they are put off by the flies,” he said.Lindi Mokoena said if it wasn’t for the flies they would be a happy community. “We are pleading with the authorities to help us get the kraal removed.”Ward five ANC Councillor Themba Gama said he is aware of the residents’ problem with flies. “We have signed a petition and are waiting for the municipality to respond to our request to have the livestock removed from the residential area,” he said.“Many people have been complaining and the municipality is taking their complaints seriously. They will act on it. Sooner or later the livestock will be removed.” Lesedi Municipality said they will forward the matter to the department responsible. They urged communities to report any service delivery complaints to their customer care hotline on 016 330 0400.
