MOLETSENE Makoti is a heartbroken man. This is because he feels the justice system has let him down and no one cares about him.   The 36-year-old from Makapanstad in North West told Daily Sun his problems with the police started in 2008 when he went to open an assault case against his neighbour and was sent home without being helped.   He said every time he went to the local police station to report cases, the cops refused to even listen to what he had to say. He said they laughed at him and made jokes about him.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuG7W1BYYuUDQciVS2-84p1ii0eyt07tn8hZeoW5B72jS6lLdm2u4vBzdfCtNOkY5Sh4Wde_LElvgQlSxUV-phMEffOuQAQrNYGv8YqPUZUc5TR-a_E9TkKf304DwTMrrUQHvB4WwPKgo1J9_pfU63nN3askFhiOuLYeXr1y0STgCa7ombqvS9kKTWelieo2k0cG_2jFvNAgqNq-SPAGj-8F8IrLA88Esn-j0Lae6r1ExWQHORGi6t0OaEgMrqF0oSpQn2l92ysz7L4iaD_v74UtfJu-tM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHofGmT-NczZEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I’m so hurt by all this because I’m a normal person.”   Moletsene said the police refused to help him when a stranger stole a piece of land next to his yard  which he was planning to plant vegetables on.    He said the stranger turned it into a soccer field.    “All I wanted was to plough and plant vegetables on the piece of land I had been allocated. Before I could do this, I found kids and a stranger playing soccer on it,” he said.   “When I went to the police they just ignored me as always and turned me away. I need help.”   Police spokesman Vuyo Mhaga said: “We condemn the alleged behaviour of the police.  Every South African has the right to be served with dignity and respect.   We are going to follow up the matter to get to the bottom of it.   “We will also communicate with the complainant.”
