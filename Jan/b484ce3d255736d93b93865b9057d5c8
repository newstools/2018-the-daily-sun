had issued Prasa the same prohibition directive last year in June after a train
collision occurred in Elandsfontein, Ekurhuleni.RSR
said that the 9 January accident convinced them that Prasa “does not have the
means to prevent accidents from happening during degraded mode when manual
authorizations are undertaken.”“Prasa
is, therefore, prohibited from manually authorizing trains until such a time
that normal train services are restored or until such a time when Prasa Rail
can provide the RSR with a comprehensive and convincing action plan for all
affected areas in all the provinces where Metrorail trains operate.”The
prohibition was implemented with immediate effect.RSR
also said that if Prasa does not comply with the prohibition directive,
criminal charges would be laid.
