She told the SunTeam she last saw her father in 1994. “Finding my father’s grave will bring peace to the family. “We have been looking for his grave for many years now. “We have been to municipal offices and cemeteries but could not find him. “Now we can finally breathe a sigh of relief. “The family will have to sit down and discuss a way forward.“We want to discuss whether we should bury him again since he always appeared in our dreams begging for a dignified funeral.” Bethuel’s son, Morape Mammila (44), said he last spoke to his father in the early 80s. To his surprise, they lived less than five kilometres away from each other for many years but never met. His father was living in Tweefontein G, while he was in neighbouring Thembalethu.“I am shocked we lived in neighbouring villages but never bumped into each other. “I lived in Thembalethu for many years before my job forced me to move to Tshwane. “I even got married there. “When my father died, I was still living there.” Sarah Jiyane (66), the woman who lived with Bethuel and had children with him, said she tried her best to find his family after he died. She said she is happy Bethuel’s family finally knows where their father was laid to rest. Sara said Bethuel died on duty while working as a security guard in Brakpan.
