SUPERSPORT United coach Eric Tinkler says his charges will need to show character if they were to beat free scoring Maritzburg United tomorrow night.This catch up Absa Premiership clash is billed for the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg (7.30pm). Tinkler’s boys suffered their second consecutive defeat to Golden Arrows on Sunday. That defeat meant United have now gone eight matches without a win, and tomorrow they will be looking for what would be their fifth win this season. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvGVLa9TT_1hXhmsOYxN6DWk7O7O3mJtffeSQQrhJqJJ6v1qiU01mHprZBqXBgJ2oPXfRt8yDT0ndUDslGmsKM4wwXW-FiKvJAusTi6MjjXuLvmfB3J5oq3Im4wJITic-vfrlazpKY_8n9whhvt1UB-woSy2TeS1H_LpYw9rwEu5Y4BCsSvp9XH5JeliTt03w5Mmjy6kHnCuj5rZS2_NNWpp_wGqyEBsPnuorQd0j0NcMw9LP3EjjsBEGsLaO2MN5Iymj0qlqogDXzGASCC2NT8qw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPs9LrteRRbIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Against Arrows we looked nervous and cagey, which was disappointing because there is no one putting them under pressure. In our next match against Maritzburg we need to get that belief back on. Also I don’t know why is that belief gone. We would need to up our game against Maritzburg. They are a good side and we have to work extra hard to get those three points.”Tinkler also confirmed they will only leave Durban after Saturday’s match against AmaZulu at Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium. He said they have scheduled their training sessions in KZN, as it would make little sense if they were to go back to Randburg seeing they are playing PSL matches every three days in KZN this week.
