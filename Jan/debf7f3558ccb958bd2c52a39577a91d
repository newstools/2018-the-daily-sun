I feel as if I failed her. I am so hurt that she is gone. My daughter was always happy,” said Letlhogonolo.Kagiso police spokeswoman Captain Solomon Sibiya said police received a report on Monday afternoon about a toddler swept away by water. She said police divers and fire fighters responded. “The child was found an hour later in the reeds after an intensive search. She was certified dead on the scene,” she said.
