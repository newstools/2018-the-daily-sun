Water will be fetched from elsewhere.“About 30 000 runners will take part. We’ve been working closely with the city for over a year about the race.“We won’t have busy water stations and shower points like we used to. Our sponsors Powerade and Coca-Cola will also provide drinks to complement for the water shortage.”Vosloo added that they were aware with the extra costs of staging the marathon, but it was all about the spirit of running the marathon. Prominent runner Jenna Challenor, who took part at the IAAF World Championships in London in 2017, is a regular runner in the women’s 56km.Challenor said South Africans are too spoiled when it comes to the issue of water. Challenor, who runs in the colours of KMPG, secured second place in the ladies main race when she cloaked 3:47:32 last year. She said: “I’m happy to know that the race is going ahead as planned. We’re being too spoilt in SA, but we haveto take it in our stride and sympathise with the city.“The water crisis is not a train smash we just have to take small sips and get on with it.”Last year’s winner in the men’s 56km Lungile Gongqa of Nedbank Running Club said he is not worried about the water crises as he has his eyes firmly on defending his title. Gongqa said: “I’m working hard in training to defend my title. I’m camping in Joburg and I’m in the best possible shape to win the marathon again.” Gongqa won the marathon in 3:09:43sec and he said that he does not take too much water during races. He said: “I run a strategic race and don’t take too much water. I don’t believe in luxury during races.”
