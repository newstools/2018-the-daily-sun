Relatives told the SunTeam Nosiphiwo recently broke up with him and on Saturday, they claim he came to her family’s house in the middle of the night to take revenge. Police spokesman Captain Mofana Masela said the ex-boyfriend was bust and charged with murder and malicious damage to property. Nosiphiwo’s mum Xolisa (50) said: “I had left to sleep at my boyfriend’s house. Seven of my children and grandchildren were sleeping at my house. “I later got a call from one of them, saying the house was set alight after Nosiphiwo’s ex-lover screamed he would kill them all. When I arrived, neighbours were helping to rescue the children and put out the fire.” She said three of them, including Nosiphiwo, were rushed to hospital with burn wounds. “After the cops arrested my daughter’s ex-lover, he confessed in front of me to throwing a petrol bomb into the room where she was sleeping,” said Xolisa. She said Nosiphiwo was in an abusive relationship and her ex-boyfriend used to beat her. According to the mum, he had been threatening to kill Nosiphiwo and burn down the house since last year. Masela said the suspect will appear in the Tembisa Magistrates Court soon.
