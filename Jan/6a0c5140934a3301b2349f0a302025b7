COPS have issued a warning that thugs have been forcing women to go into the bushes to give them a blow job and then rape them! The five rapists are said to be prowling the streets of Kagiso in Mogale City and surrounding areas. Two victims have come forward, and cops have appealed to community members to help them catch the heartless thugs. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvdthnKtbHl_Xw3Q8-1NKHoUQf-VWqk5Gkn7mGjywj0nqXCrX1euqFl0a5ps8ZgFYgAC99xc8JXtG_eErzdPAXGJGc20BpYc8vdogldEFXY0oBbwIUyMwTtT2Vgci7KsKabVP1yQBIqPLGH-op2oDhSvCmvdsDv_2SgOFL8cSvi7YMgZskr6d5S51uHVzSBgVNKBw3HSpFuqo6kUVjsA95FF5sc0-GOvIztrXamzu_uN7-fQkTLqRVPZpbuLPlmKq3XFfQDqY-bJ3w8-XIuPgPH7nUi4Pw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDCzAKN4MhwMEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

One of the women said: “As one finishes, the other one comes for you to suck his penis.” Sibiya said what the men did was heartless as the women feared they had contracted STDs. The victims were taken for counselling. “We have launched a manhunt for these suspects and we appeal to the public to help us trace them so we can put them where they belong,” he said. “They are heartless and don’t deserve to live in normal communities.” Sibiya appealed to other women who might have been raped by these suspects and had not opened cases to come forward. “Cops managed to do identikits of two of the suspects,” he said. “Anyone with information is asked to contact Warrant Officer Amanda Strooh on 011 951 1730.”
