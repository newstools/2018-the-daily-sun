Although the suspects appeared in court recently, they were released on R1 000 bail, Lesufi said, adding that a civil case would be initiated if need be to retrieve the stolen goods. He said the matter of Klipspruit-Wes Secondary School in Johannesburg south - in which community members don’t want the appointment of a black principal - had been taken to the national minister, who was convinced that the principal was the right person for the position, and that the process followed had been correct.Lesufi expressed his disappointment at the drop in performance at the school, saying that it had never performed this badly since its inception."The school has never performed below 60%… 47% of learners have failed. We think it’s because of the tensions. We are reluctant to take new Grade 12s to that school because they will also fail," he said. Lesufi said he would visit the community on Thursday, after visiting Noordgesig Primary School on Wednesday - a school with a similar issue. The MEC is due to hand over a new school to Everest Primary School in Newclare, Westbury, on Wednesday, along with Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Infrastructure Development MEC Jacob Mamabolo.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/more-than-28-000-gauteng-pupils-still-need-to-be-placed-20180116
