Former
public protector Thuli Madonsela’s daughter Wenzile is counting down the days
until she welcomes a baby girl into the world.Her
first child with husband Khulekile Msimanga is due in just two weeks – but
Wenzile’s secretly hoping the baby won’t arrive on Valentine’s Day. “The
due date is 15 February. Obviously they decide when they’re going to enter this
world so I’ve just been hoping that she doesn’t arrive on mommy’s day which is
Valentine’s Day,” Wenzile told YOU with a laugh.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstF0qmXI4till-xghvH262iJ1DgSET9c4jlC7M1Nnkz_qpP4HYkAEYomuR0Rcs7qqdcwxX-b6LSWxHE5jKFejBz4YNFncqPkVFkaT2noCzttSkUeMSN2ywIDaB6b5s01pXzzX3A0hgSyZjLgTokYH7dw8_HvqzWBFfAKDnhGD-r9o1K-WtY6l5vQwdQAe69-y6h4zLQbcrlQ9CetweqOtfYWrb6NDBXT6EVlZA2ymqwXkB5cqXYArP6cF_9X4BfwtBNf8WXa6q4nrprmNxtbe7DORw9rmFgS4QzIQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJOUkbpccTiKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

says Thuli is thrilled about becoming a granny.“She
knew long before I thought she knew,” Wenzile says.She’d
told her brother when she was 11 weeks pregnant and asked him not to tell
anyone – but clearly he couldn’t keep the exciting news to himself.He
told Thuli, who’s now a professor at Stellenbosch University’s Law Faculty,
making her promise not to tell Wenzile that she knew.“I
believed she didn’t know and I wanted to tell her in person so I waited until
about two months later when she was in the country, but she already knew,” Wenzile
says.“What
I really respected about that moment is that she never said to me that she knew
and allowed me to feel comfortable in the space to tell her as if this was new
to her.”When
her mother returned from a trip to America with larger clothing for her,
Wenzile grew suspicious that her mother knew.“When
she came back from New York she bought me some clothes and these huge, puffy,
maternity-looking clothes and I thought, ‘Surely not, she doesn’t know, maybe
she thinks I’m fat.’ So she was still trying to be a parent without imposing on
me.”As
soon as I told her she was supportive from the get-go. She’s just been an
absolute gem and I couldn’t imagine doing this without her,” Wenzile says.The
excited grandmother-to-be even bought the baby a romper with the words ‘I love
Harvard’ and ‘Harvard 2035’ on it.  1/5https://www.channel24.co.za/News/Local/pics-thuli-madonsela-to-become-a-grandmother-20180131
