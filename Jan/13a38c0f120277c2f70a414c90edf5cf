He tells us we like to complain,” said Kefuiwe. “We want him to bring his child here to see what it’s like to have no place to pee or kak. Our teachers are expected to produce good results under difficult conditions. This is unacceptable.”Parents toyi-toyied last year to get the department to refurbish the toilets. They say many toilet hire companies came to the school but ended up removing toilets due to non-payment by the department.Another SGB member, Rejoice Ramfate, said not only the toilets were rotten, but also the classrooms.“The mobile classrooms are dilapidated. Doors are falling off and the ceiling is collapsing.”The SunTeam saw broken ceilings and exposed electrical wires in some of the classrooms.The school, which is a no-fee paying school, has 1 029 pupils.Steve Mabona of the Gauteng Department of Education promised there would be temporary toilets at the school today.“We are working with the service provider to make sure the children have toilets,” he said.
