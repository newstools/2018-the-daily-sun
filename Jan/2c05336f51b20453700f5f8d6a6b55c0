He has been smoking for a year.  “I’ve realised I need to be rehabilitated so that I can go back to school,” he said.  “I was a good pupil doing grade 9 when I started using drugs.  “Now all I do is push people’s parcels so they can give me something to buy nyaope.” Hawks spokesman Captain Dineo Segotodi said a campaign to reduce drug use among the youth was growing.  “We’ve already approached some kids who requested us to assist them with going back to their families,” she said.  “And for us to do so we’ll engage with other departments to make this a success.  “Our target was three victims, but we ended up getting 10 and we’ll assist by referring them to a rehabilitation centre. “There were also four Mozambican who came to us for assistance and all were referred to the South African National Council for Alcoholism and Drug Dependence,” said Segotodi. The Hawks’ Brigadier Obed Ngwenya said their involvement was about ensuring the addicts returned to their families.  “We want to wage war against drugs and crime in general,” he said. “What we have noticed as the Hawks in Mpumalanga is that most crime is fuelled by drug abuse People rob and steal just to get money for drugs.”   Nozipho Mathokwane from Sanca said they will work with the Hawks to changepeople’s lives.
