This was after Siyabonga “Bhele” Nomvethe and Ovidy Karuru scored the all-important goals to secure their club’s first win of the new year.Johnson assured supporters that their team would not get relegated. Said the coach: “We are still building the team and will continue to work hard. Our fans will see their team continue playing in the Premiership next season, I can assure them of that.”The former SuperSport mentor said he was never worried about losing his job, as he believes his players are capable of turning their fortunes around.He added: “I have never felt any heat. I was always confident of my players, knowing that if we get our tactics correct and score goals first, we will win. Yes, in some games things didn’t go as planned, but that never meant we were a bad team.”AmaZulu host off-form Bloemfontein Celtic on Wednesday in a match that was abandoned in December due to a waterlogged pitch. Johnson says it’s a crucial match for them.“The SuperSport win doesn’t mean the monkey is off our backs. We are playing at home and we have to win. Having said that, we will need to tread carefully against them. They are dangerous despite their recent setback.”
