Stomach pain, upset stomach, strong headaches, nausea and flu symptoms. “Please, people. Take note as many in PE, Despatch and Uitenhage have been affected already. Don’t let the kids play in sand.”Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “The municipality complies with government’s strict legal and environmental requirements in terms of water service. “The water affairs department enforces water requirements and conducts regular inspection of the municipality’s drinking water plants.”Mniki rejected the social media posts. “These messages are sent by people who want to cause unnecessary panic.“We don’t know what they aim to achieve by misinforming our people.“If there was a problem, the public would have been informed.“The messages circulating on social media are mischievous. Only two cases of meningitis have been linked to the national listeriosis disease outbreak.“While the disease is treatable and preventable, the December outbreak has resulted in an unprecedented number of fatal cases.”Mniki said the national government is leading the disease control operation, in partnership with the World Health Organisation and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. “Everything possible is being done to ensure that the outbreak is contained. “With only two recorded cases in the metro, the situation here is stable.”
