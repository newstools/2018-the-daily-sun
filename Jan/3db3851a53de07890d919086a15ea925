The country cannot tolerate such acts.” Karam said Chonco, the father of seven children, did not think of his family.“Your children will suffer because of what you did.”Chonco’s lawyer, Advocate Marius van Wyngaard, filed an appeal against the verdict as he said the witnesses’ testimonies were not consistent. Karam granted the appeal.Mantombi Buthelezi (61), who lost her son Vusimuzi Buthelezi during the taxi violence, said she was happy Chongo will be spending a long time in prison.“This won’t bring back my son, but I am happy the law has taken its course.”
