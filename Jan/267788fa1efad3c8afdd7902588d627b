Their security vehicle was badly vandalised. According to Brian, they didn’t know why Aaron was shot, which angered everyone.“These people must explain because my uncle did nothing wrong,” said Brian.Silas said neither his co-workers nor the owner of the farm came to the house. No representatives from the security company visited them either.“We relied on Aaron for so many things. He provided for the family,” said Silas.Aaron’s older brother, Lucas Matavhatsindi (56), said they didn’t know where to start.“We have to arrange for his funeral and we don’t have any money to bury him. We still can’t believe that he is gone,” said Lucas According to the family, Aaron had been working at the poultry farm for almost 15 months as a tractor driver.MEC for Economic Development, Agriculture and Rural Development, Lebogang Maile, visited the Mutavhatsidi family to offer condolences.Maile was accompanied by Mogale City mayor Naga Lipudi to offer words of comfort to the family.
