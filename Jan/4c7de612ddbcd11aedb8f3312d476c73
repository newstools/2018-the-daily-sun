But it doesn’t stop there. I want to study for the rest of my life," he said.Mjikelwa, who matriculated from St James Senior Secondary School in Cofimvaba in the Eastern Cape, said the year was challenging for him after setting his goals."Academically, at the beginning of the year, when you start having those big dreams, you start giving yourself to the work. But then you realise there’s a lot of work and not enough time," he said.During preparations for his exams in his matric year, Mjikelwa said he would often work until midnight or later and be up around 04:00 or 05:00.Despite this, he still found time to finally play football for his high school after years of playing volleyball.Mjikelwa believes that anyone can achieve the same results he did if they changed their mindsets and worked hard enough.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/i-want-to-study-for-the-rest-of-my-life-says-top-performing-matriculant-20180104
