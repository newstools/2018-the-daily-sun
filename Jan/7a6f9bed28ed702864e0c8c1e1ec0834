DATING online or through social media has become a fundamental part of how humans look for love – but it has its own issues.Research from Kaspersky Labs found that sharing personal information on dating sites makes people vulnerable to scammers and cybercriminals. Even within minutes of getting a match or starting a chat, 11% of people admit to giving out personal information which opens them up to risk.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Success/Health&sz=300x250&c=1676477342&t=artid%3d49027834-653f-419f-ad4b-7aea190c28f5%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Success/Health&sz=300x250&c=1676477342&t=artid%3d49027834-653f-419f-ad4b-7aea190c28f5%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>Andrei Mochola, head of consumer business at Kaspersky Lab, said remote dating might seem harmless, but users of online matching services freely give personal and sensitive information without a second thought – many users put it on their public profile. “In Mzansi, 23% admit to sharing their full name on their public dating profile; 12% have shared their home address and 13% provide details about their work or trade secrets this way – and 8% have even shared naked photos of themselves with others!”Online daters are exposed to more cyberthreats – with the research showing that 51% of individuals in Mzansi who use online dating have experienced some sort of electronic security incident, such as having their devices or accounts hacked or being targeted by fraudsters or confidence tricksters.In spite of all of this, many online daters do not even use simple methods to protect themselves – only 26% do not allow dating apps to access their device data and 20% use some sort of security or anti-virus app.“Users need to be more untrusting of others when it comes to giving away information about themselves on all kinds of social media and public profiles. “Much as you would not tell a random person on the street your home or work address and phone number, don’t do it online.”
