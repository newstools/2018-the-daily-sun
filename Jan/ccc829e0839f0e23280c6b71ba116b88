Almost R24 000 in cash was also seized, as well as drugs,” she said. Sekgotodi said a follow-up investigation led to the arrest of Jozeph du Plessis (71) and his wife Susanna du Plessis (55) in Bainsvlei, Bloemfontein. The five suspects are believed to be part of a syndicate.The case goes back to court tomorrow.
