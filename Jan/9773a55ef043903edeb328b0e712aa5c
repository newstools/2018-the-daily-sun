A YOUNG man accused of being a drug dealer learned the hard way that there is no convenient time to break the law. Last Thursday the 24-year-old waited for sunset before driving through the Maseru border post between Mzansi and Lesotho with millions of rands’ worth of hidden dagga. He thought the officers who were working the night shift would be too tired and sleepy to search his car properly.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssgPxEb-u5srqOnV8oUsThj6JSNoyT7K-VbB2GRaU4JMnadSdJlTkmeMUplfbGDMNGhlImpsbk5kbYD60wbr7IA9Ivp_Z-N4aGVJ1mQ4SrsTHk05OMMD9etmJyzk2qjPjU4SdsBu3ValL2rtw_UomHITPqO7oGWWcmeYlDarGuNu1fVa_hLcnhMuBGxcYnLszbQ9M4_JpEqDX7yrX_-FVWy5Dzk2FDfoiVDflTmi4ZkoVbFZEeZvmAiNbChY-HCaznI9sixpxZqyQoUzxbnwZ1SLfxhfb8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKANeWBUWjC6EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It did not take long for the cops to realise the truck had a false compartment.“That is when the officers started to get suspicious,” said police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini.The driver – who said he was on his way to make a delivery in Gauteng – told police that whatever they found in the false compartment was not on the back of his truck. But his claim was not enough to convince police he was not up to no good. When the false compartment was opened the police officers’ suspicions were confirmed.“The officers found 147 bags of dagga in the compartment.“The uncovered dagga stash had an estimated value of R5 million,” said Captain Dhlamini.When he was questioned, the driver claimed that the bags of dagga did not belong to him. He was arrested, however, and charged with dealing in drugs. “The suspect will appear before the Ladybrand Magistrates Court soon,” said Captain Dhlamini.
