    MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane is as  angry as a bear with a sore foot following
their disastrous 3-2 loss to Polokwane City on Saturday. And the technical bench boss indicated after their loss that
he was “100% not well”, taking out his infuriation on his misfiring players
who, he said, lacked integrity. “I was saying I would take a point but unfortunately we
lost,” said Mosimane, who saw his charges travel 302km from Chloorkop to
Polokwane only to donate three points.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuPOVDmJUbxeANtdwBu87DFx90v-xanvwbfnTuhqas6ZkrujkoI6F328vR65MDz9EuVstxSeDvkqtV38rplHmUkvKJUI4ImwvVCLhZk-5j-cx3_-_PhqGgdMm8R_mACAJ4LJfb_dPCWC_p__G4MBrm0QkuyRv1_l2AyHPWnp6mPxvcUdndYdzcCtxTnqvpDDC90DHc2uoNS0rGb7lEoH9ZkSqkQ78Mm2iTGRqzcvQGkMs7GrYoeGkzJKKdUp7KFNbI_ynHbyEPk_bP4tov-\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDMde1CIf7WYEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

following their 2-1 defeat to the same side in the first round, where Rodney

the sidelines. gladiator, slotting in two goals.And on Saturday Ramagalela again drilled the final nail into
Downs’ coffin 10 minutes before full-time, adding to the goals scored by his
teammates Sammy Seabi in the 58th minute and Walter Musona a minute later.What irked Mosimane the most was fact that George Lebese had
broken the ice three minutes into the game but his goal and another by Oupa
Manyisa were not enough to stop City from winning the match.And the coach is now hoping that his players will respond
better against an out-of-sorts Ajax Cape Town, who gave up a lead to lose 2-1
to Maritzburg United in the Mother City on Friday.Ajax will host Downs in an Absa Premiership showdown at the
Cape Town Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm), where sparks will surely fly.Mosimane did not hold back: “I am very angry with the
players. “This is a very funny season. I have been around but I have
never seen anything like this. Two different halves. The second half was the
worst I have ever seen since I came to Sundowns. It was bad!“We should have wrapped it up in the first half. Why do I
coach when we play like that? “I mean, it was a freeway and we should have easily won it.
I was very angry – I had warned them of the challenges we might face,” fumed
the coach.“It’s difficult for us as coaches. Maybe we are still on our
Christmas break, hopefully we will come back. This is probably our wake-up
call.“But in football, the could haves and would haves do not
count. City played on the break and hit us on counter-attack.“During the break I told my players that I would be happy to
keep it at zero (not conceding). I prayed we could win zero to one. “I warned them that these kind of games will come back to
bite you.”But Mosimane is not giving up, as he told his players to
“play to stay on top”. Said the 53-year-old coach known as Jingles: “It is a mental
game now.“Against Ajax we will play the Sundowns way. We cannot talk
about being strong when we are not scoring. Football is about results.”However, he believes the loss will not dampen their spirits:
“We cannot predict the result of the next game. We cannot say because of this
and that, this is what will happen in our next game. We take it one game at the
time. The future will be determined in the end. It is a process.”
