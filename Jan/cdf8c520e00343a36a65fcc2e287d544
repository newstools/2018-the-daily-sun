said Prasa had decided to promote Swartz to acting CEO on January 3, ignoring
legal advice given at the end of December 2017 that he should be suspended.Swartz has
held numerous positions at the rail agency, including Western Cape regional manager
and, more recently, executive manager for mainline passenger services.UniteBehind
listed several reasons why Swartz should be fired immediately. It also demanded
that he be forced to account for his actions.Irregular
procurement processesGroundUp
approached Prasa to comment on all the allegations described in the letter.Prasa
spokesperson Nana Zenani said the agency had no comment.Sipho
Sithole, head of communications at Prasa, had also not responded to questions
by the time of publication.The
UniteBehind letter states that Swartz is still under investigation for his time
at mainline passenger services.The
allegations against him include corruption, irregular procurement processes,
intimidation and sexual harassment.GroundUp
has seen a document that confirms that an internal investigation of these
allegations is indeed taking place.Case
confirmed by HawksThe
coalition also states that Swartz is being investigated for alleged involvement
in the theft of rail lines and sleepers in Elliot, Eastern Cape, in 2013.GroundUp
has seen a police document related to this case. According to the document,
people were caught removing rail lines and sleepers in January 2013.The
suspects then produced a letter of authorisation with an employee code on it, a
Metrorail scrap form, a request for used rail form, and a map of the country's
railway lines.The
document does not state that Swartz is a suspect, but says: "The public
prosecutor needs the following statements from relevant persons (but not Mthura
Swartz) in Metrorail Cape Town" regarding the letter and the employee
code.Hawks
Eastern Cape spokesperson Captain Anelisa Feni, said she could only confirm
that the Hawks are investigating a case related to Prasa but could "not
reveal the identities of the suspects".Feni said
no other information could be shared with the public yet.Public
Protector investigationUniteBehind
alleges that Swartz appointed two junior staff members who did not have the
necessary qualifications and relevant security clearances.But
GroundUp was not able to confirm whether the employees named in the letter were
registered with the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (Psira).Psira
requires ID numbers to check registration and we do not have the ID numbers of
the employees.UniteBehind
claims that Swartz is being investigated for "a range of unlawful activities"
by the Public Protector.This week,
Cleopatra Mosana, spokesperson for the Public Protector, confirmed to GroundUp
that the organisation's Western Cape office had received an anonymous complaint
for "alleged maladministration in relation to mismanagement and abuse of
resources, irregular recruitment and labour processes" by "officials
at Metrorail Western Cape" in 2013.She said
the Public Protector's office received new information from Prasa for this case
on December 21, 2017."This
information still has to be evaluated and incorporated by the
investigators."R8m tender
controversyThe
investigation is ongoing, she said. But GroundUp has seen no evidence that
Swartz is the subject of this investigation.The
coalition said that Swartz's poor record started over a decade ago while
working as executive director at the City of Cape Town.In February
2007, a city disciplinary tribunal found Swartz guilty of eight counts of
"failing to perform his duties as a senior manager" for his role in
the controversial Jewellery City tender of more than R8m.According
to a 2007 article, Swartz approved the payment of R1 200 per hour to a
consultant from Johannesburg for managing the Jewellery City project.He appealed
against the ruling but it is unclear if his appeal was successful. City
officials had not been able to provide information on this by the time of
publication.Should the
Prasa board decide not to suspend Swartz, UniteBehind said it should give
legally valid reasons for this by the close of business on Thursday.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/prasa-appoints-a-ceo-who-is-under-investigation-for-corruption-20180111
