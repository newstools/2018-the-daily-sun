INDECISION, costly errors and some poor decision-making let Banyana Banyana down as they succumbed 3-0 to Sweden in their friendly international at Cape Town Stadium yesterday.These and other many facets of their game will have to improve significantly if they are to qualify for the 2019 Fifa World Cup.An own goal by Bambanani Mbane and a brace by Loreta Kullashi underlined the scope of the work Banyana still have to do ahead of the 2018 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations later this year, where a good run could guarantee them a World Cup berth in France.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss23z9fZlxg4gqlJJPBhLUN2xy8PoNADyPgq1Ozua86JEBPJXoZijmb-Pyf3xN896iEL-mON323WPmV-FCvHcmQiL9C3Pnpp3nze8RgpI9E9Jw_8ZAU5XV5Rn8ccXuRPlisd82KS9DlFEM8w-G21IGYVU8kyvxbgrUEd6_uScrsc-Xk2GkdUkz0bo71xEAclh_19xAsTghNLzunn0NYwY1Zhe9X0EJeXchCtHDuH05-b-wdq5FkxHzBOZb6RF2gzeVgH5JKfgaruX77DDf8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGYGiB08UL6BEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But they made it all too easy for the Europeans, as they just rolled over to be trampled.Ranked 10th in the world and fifth in Europe, Sweden barely raised a sweat in the scorching Cape sun, brushing aside the Caf Team of the Year.Banyana suffered an early setback as Mbane headed into her own net in her attempt to clear a free kick. But they soon got into their rhythm, Thembi Kgatlana coming close as Banyana searched for an equaliser. Her best chance came near the half-hour mark when released by Chantelle Esau.However, the UWC striker was let down by poor decision-making.And Esau, Queen of the Match, could not do better, also fluffing a good opportunity during Banyana’s period of dominance.Stina Blackstenius crossed for Kullashi to slot in the second goal two minutes into the second half. Kullashi then profited from a rare defensive error by Refiloe Jane to add her second of the match.Try as they could, Banyana couldn’t get back into the game. Judging from this performance they may suffer a similar fate in the second friendly this week.
