They stick candles into the bottles and decorate their tables,” she said.When the SunTeam arrived at her house in Goodwood, Cape Town, she showed us 16 bottles she had prepared for a special tea at a church.She started her business last year.“The response I’ve received from people is amazing, so I think it’s a good business. Sometimes I sit up past midnight decorating bottles. If I don’t finish my target, I can’t sleep.”She sells the bottles in sets of two or three. The price ranges between R180 and R250.
