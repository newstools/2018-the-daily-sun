A FAMILY in Port Elizabeth is angry with the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality for failing to fix a burst sewerage pipe.The flowing sewage builds up at the gate of their house.Nondumiso Layiti of Motherwell, NU13, said her family and other residents in the area have been living with raw sewage on their doorsteps since October last year.Her house is at the corner of Hani and Gwala streets.She told Daily Sun she had reported the problem several times to the municipality, but had no luck.She said: “We reported the matter to the municipality, but no help has been forthcoming. The sewage is right next to my gate.“My kids didn’t enjoy the festive season because of the stench coming from the blocked manhole. There are flies and large worms thatalso crawl into the house. The situation is not good for our health. We desperately need help.”Nondumiso lives with many children and she fears they will get sick if they play outside.Vusi Davies (47) lives in NU 8 and has a girlfriend in the area.He said: “The sight of it makes me think twice before visiting my girlfriend. The sewage is all over the street and has blocked a trenchoutside the NU13 community hall. Something must be done to make the place look better.”Nelson Mandela Bay mayoral spokeswoman, Sibongile Dimbaza, said: “I’ll bring this to the attention of our teams to quickly attend to it.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssvXVgnJPoL8FIIAIjkB9BRa4NGpzNlt6imnG4sc-UO2yMZEkrE6_UnsgGkVz50Nk_Zu_nDltG3Nm5OYjKEWzGlLHh04LNEomWtP8HG1fnr6Ws1gfoNdqdR3BIYr1nYnvpleS-RT8Bu5Lk1ovmzZ_6anhwqFOG4-QniJUdNY5BGgTmrm6LgWCIuSIOn01melT_J9J1tRLFEe9qB6qNWTovyEJGtSbL0m49dJGdLjFScVeEC-V7HGm6I9CT7hvXPIIQqsdCb2FqL2a3XlSeStWgZlsKoYcI\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YRMTC8C49OY4bU3v39OBKEABohgfF1N3b2yGXke2KfjAa60tQyUKrt6D4U8CDQuFK45fK7yoOk5FOiJMFVd883_WSP0tEK8SDDYehXX\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOR3lLOS-VYyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
