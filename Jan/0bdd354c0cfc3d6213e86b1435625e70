THE last thing Frank Mosita (61) remembers is withdrawing money from the bank on Saturday and walking back to his Isuzu bakkie.When he woke up, he found himself in the mountains outside Groblersdal, Limpopo with no money and no bakkie!According to Limpopo police, Frank, from Vleisboom Village in Nebo, was hijacked after withdrawing money.The hijackers then drove away with him.Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a search operation was launched following Frank’s disappearance and he was found alive.“But the victim was found with complications as he could not talk, had no money and his car was missing.“He was immediately taken to hospital for medical attention.”Police said Frank and his wife left home to go shopping in Groblersdal.“His wife left him in the bank queue to go shopping.“But she later realised something had happened to him when she couldn’t find him at the bank.“She checked where their car was and was surprised to find it missing too. Later, she saw their bakkie in town being driven very quickly.“She tried to call her husband repeatedly until his cellphone was answered by an unknown man who then dropped the call.“Police were informed and a search operation followed,” Ngoepe added.He said the couple’s white Isuzu bakkie with the registration number DZ 05 BV GP still is missing.The suspects are unknown and there have been no arrests.Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects and recovery of the bakkie should call the CrimeStop number, 08600 10111, or their nearest cop shop.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv49t17KXRbd9gejO5359N7CEyqCuHjTZZcG9QhxwxsipM-rk_xcrTijbmATolv7u4-O3F5gJzwmf51VRlQ2_XYMM0j_NOIV_HtH-QuuPuWH8dC-HpLhbSoy-EesSG2uJKUloxxKM0yTDaCtB4gkapsWXUv_6jMNrrGsMpNywIyv1HHWvzmcdVDJfRnTIpfmVAObYGDFszqt-P9gtKTR5FfQMPm1MOvWLqw0QkEJ4aq8_CNFUYxi88kBowBE4ZrPReqJho_WzK0DxhWQQuX0Pz_kAb5Gmw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNg1lbUqvqUXEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
