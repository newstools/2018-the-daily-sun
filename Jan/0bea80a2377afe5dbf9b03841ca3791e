Maybe they shot her elsewhere and dumped her body here,” she said.Malizole Jafta (62) said gunshots were always fired in the area. “We hardly go out to check when we hear gunshots. We live in fear because this place is ruled by criminals. “We do not have anywhere else to go. We rely on God’s protection,” said Jafta.Another resident said the minister of police should send a task team to search for illegal firearms.“There is no place that has as many illegal firearms as Western Cape.“You’d swear there is a shop that sells them,” he said.Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the death of four people between the ages of 24 and 27 years was under investigation. No one has been arrested. Anyone with more information is asked to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
