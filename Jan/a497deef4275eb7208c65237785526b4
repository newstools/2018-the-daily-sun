He mixes the camel pee with milk, as once recommended by Prophet Mohammed for its medicinal properties.But health authorities have since expressed concern at the practice and disputed the healing powers of camels’ pee. They warn that drinking it can put you at risk of developing Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), otherwise known as camel flu.Usir has come under fire for his extremist views. He has been accused of sending money to forces supporting ISIS.
