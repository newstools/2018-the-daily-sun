The inquiry was being held at the offices of the Chief Justice in Midrand on Monday.The Constitutional Court ordered last year that an inquiry be held to investigate whether she should be held personally liable for the costs incurred during the Sassa payment crisis.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvQDjmqHrN8Goi8dr7LwQBWsbpZjxkhywxFKMUvj9SqrGAMAiTxfCE7eV7M-QiiBwUGAoM0m7hUtuuJFmxBaAORpxMKnEAFhgpydhTJTgL6_Op_lve69XQ1gwbGhlBt7stgHpTgdJtD3evE8i55EvgsI6ii5hLqeg0qCW2NQQrZTW18Xq4sUPSYFgwQapGUKFWQP44nt96vdHGiYKEsqS9R6hlfBqRQVotqamwfDc2F6OQiYtzxbLu8c-Tsj36QFKCpmq_lPWkAJw_pdHvyC1m--wcd8lQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGivxsnH2DjXEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Can you also think of any other programme that affects 17 million South Africans every month?" Budlender asked Dlamini.During the exchange, the minister insisted that all her work was important, despite Budlender's repeated attempts to have her answer the questions.In a witness statement submitted by Dlamini, she explained why she failed to disclose to the Constitutional Court the reasons for establishing the workstreams and instructing them to report directly to her."The work of the workstreams, their composition, objectives, and technical reports were not, I believed, at issue or relevant to the question the court had raised," Dlamini said in the statement."This is all the more so because I regarded the workstreams to have been engaged by Sassa and to be completing technical work on behalf of Sassa."Last year, former Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza said in an affidavit that the workstreams were given a broad mandate to take over the implementation of the project and that the social security agency was instructed not to interrupt or delay them in their work.However, Dlamini said during her testimony that she was not aware that Magwaza or former social development director-general Zane Dangor considered the workstreams to be a parallel process to the work being done by Sassa.Dlamini's cross-examination continues on Tuesday.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/dlamini-denies-undermining-sassa-with-parallel-workstreams-20180122
