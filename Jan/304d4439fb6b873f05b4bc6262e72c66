found Dagada to have been involved in price fixing with a service provider to
the City, and in the process acted against his sworn duty to our residents,”
Mashaba said.“It is understood from the
investigation that Cllr Dagada has acted in a manner which has sought, either
directly or indirectly, to benefit service providers and officials closely
associated with him.“ In this process a series of
events have transpired that, in my view, could not have taken place
coincidentally to the exclusive benefit of these associates,” her added.Disciplinary action has been taken
against Dagada and other officials implicated, and they will face disciplinary
enquiries for their roles in the breaches of legislation and governance
procedures.Dagada has been replaced with
Funzela Ngobeni, who was the MMC of Development planning.Mashaba condemned the allegations
against Dagada.“As an Executive Mayor, I cannot
necessarily detect the willingness of people to engage in regrettable actions.
However, we can and will continue to ensure that no act against the residents
of our City goes unpunished, especially in those we trust to deliver change,”
he said.
