the court that the incident was not a racist act, but a criminal act."Racism
is a cancer that should be removed. From the evidence that the court has, it
was not an act of racism, but an act of crime. I cannot find that the accuse
[Durant] acted racist, but acted in a criminal manner," Khan said.Durant,
dressed in blue jeans and a white shirt, appeared in a packed court.The gallery
was filled with EFF and ANC supporters, but they were soon removed for
disrupting court proceedings.ALSO READ: CHAOS BREAKS OUT IN KRUGERSDORP COURT!Khan had
also denied the media’s application to broadcasting proceedings live.Forty-two-year-old
Mutavhatsindi worked at the Bartlet Poultry Farm. He was shot and killed in an
open field near the informal settlement of Matshelapad, outside Krugersdorp,
west of Johannesburg, on January 6.State
prosecutor Rungulani Mahlongo argued that it was not in the interest of justice
to grant Durant bail.Mahlongo
was of the view that if Durant was released on bail, he would be killed."Why
did he flee the scene and run to the police station? This is a clear indication
that his life is at risk," Mahlongo told the court.He said the
court needed to send a clear message that everyone is protected, whether you
are black or white.Defence
lawyer advocate Deon Pool argued that it was in the interest of justice to
release his client on bail."This
a simple man, with a simple job, who had unfortunate circumstances. There is no
reason that he would flee," Pool told the court.Pool said
there was no statement from anyone saying: "If this man gets bail, I’m
going to kill him. The court
ordered that Durant, as part of his bail conditions, must hand in his passport,
his 9mm firearm and he is not allowed to leave Gauteng without the permission
of the investigation officer.The matter
was postponed to April 13 for further investigation.Earlier
chaos erupted when Members of the public - some clad in ANC, EFF and PAC
T-shirts - disrupted court proceedings.One person
held up a placard, saying "No bail or else", as the magistrate was
about to hand down judgment.A man in
court was overheard saying: "If that was a white man, he wouldn’t have
killed him."Police
acted swiftly to remove the protesters from the courtroom.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-man-gets-bail-of-r10-000-in-krugersdorp-farm-worker-killing-20180115
