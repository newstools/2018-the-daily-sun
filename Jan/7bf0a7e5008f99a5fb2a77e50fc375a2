The piercings don’t bother her,” he said.While some people on the street admire him and take pictures of him, others swear at him.Zukile from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, said he was almost burnt alive after he was accused of worshipping the devil.“My body is the book. It tells the story of my life,” Zukile said.“Just like any other person, I have felt happy and sad. I love to express myself and leave a memory on my body. I don’t expect people to understand this. “Anyway, I’m used to being judged and criticised.”He told Daily Sun it all began with a small tattoo called Mama Africa which is dedicated to his mum.“She gave me life and nurtured me. I love her for that,” he said.“Some people think I’m creepy but others see pure art when they look at me. My body is my own business. I do what I want.” Zukile said his family was scared at first, thinking he’d lost his marbles, but came to understand what he believed in.By the time this story appears in the newspaper, Zukile may have given in to the urge for another piercing or two.
