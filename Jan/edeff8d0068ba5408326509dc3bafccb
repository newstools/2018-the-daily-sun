SCHOOL admissions in urban and highly populated areas such as Gauteng and the Western Cape are a big challenge. Speaking at a media briefing in Tshwane yesterday, Education Minister Angie Motshekga said admissions had become an emotional problem.She said this was evident at Hoerskool Overvaal in Vereeniging, Gauteng, where the admission of 55 pupils led to a court battle and violent protests. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssLLsswSPDtiY8gPO0AJEjDxL4wseYbJBN7IsO9UHAflOeVu8_J6fluVYV1seRU_SvpJu-EyzwBY-H6z3u1-4zFF3OoKNvQQVjtMJZU0_28f8VC-yCbVGGxpeB20T_HXIgcc4lVpeHufSovBY0jTGBG-t6cvqQAGkTSzf8PU7TNVr6b_j4hZ7TMbOy-4E2mwqIHjp8D8EVnJSBb1HT4b4Gr2HQJyzOdsh_PCr0QopIgLLFTzri4D3UGxGnOU6WhlwuoX5721wUQ8kl6TnJ9-eGxorqm6wY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJUYmm_qFcafEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Motshekga said families that moved to metros which seemed to have more potential for making money created a situation where there were not enough places in schools for all applicants. She said parents who applied and accepted placement in more than one school created the impression there were still many unplaced pupils. “The pupil remains on the school’s list, preventing the place to be offered to another pupil,” she said. Motshekga said there were still many late applications despite efforts to have pupils admitted and registered in schools before the end of last year. “However, we have managed to significantly reduce the number of unplaced pupils since the start of the school year,” she said. The minister said the department was also concerned about the status of schools in the event of Day Zero in Western Cape. She said the Western Cape government was considering additional water storage and water distribution to schools.
