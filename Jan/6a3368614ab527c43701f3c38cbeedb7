Two days after his story was published, Issack received an SMS from Home Affairs telling him that the particulars of death had been lifted from his ID. And on 27 December, he was issued with a new smart card ID! When the SunTeam visited Issack at his house, he and his wife, Angie Letlhage (37), were filled with joy.He said he wakes up happy every day. “When I received the notification, I was confused and had doubts because I struggled with this for many years. “I could not believe it took Daily Sun only two days to rectify the matter.“When I was given my ID smart card, I knew at that moment that the nightmare was over. “I felt for the first time in many years that I was alive and ready to live my life. “I now wake up every morning, stretch my arms and remind myself that finally, really, I’m alive and kicking.”
