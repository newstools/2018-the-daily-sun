involved, we can always amend the charge. "One of the women is the mother of the 14-year-old girl
and one of the men is the person who was going to be her husband," said
Tyali.The Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) has condemned the
practice."The abducted girl was forced into underage and
unlawful marriage," the CGE said in a statement on Tuesday."In line with the Constitution of the Republic of South
Africa, the CGE respects cultural freedom and choice. However, the abuse of
cultural practices and symbols at the expense of women and girl children is
totally condemned," said CGE chairperson Lulama Nare."It is important for South Africans to note that no
cultural and religious practices supersede the Constitution and cultural and
religious practices should conform and be practised within the ambit of the
Constitutional values and ethos."The commission said everybody must be vigilant about the
practice and work with the police and the NPA to end it.The CGE encouraged people to report underage forced marriage
to 0800 007 709 toll-free.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mother-arrested-for-allegedly-kidnapping-her-daughter-14-for-marriage-20180124
