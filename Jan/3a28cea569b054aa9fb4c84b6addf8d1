THOLAKELE Yende has been sitting at home doing nothing for two years and now she’s gatvol.The 41-year-old from Ivory Park extension 10, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun it’s because of a sore on her left leg which won’t heal.She said every time she tries to move, her leg feels like it is being stabbed by hot needles. It even led to her losing her job and all she wants is for life to return to normal so she can support her family.It started as a small blister but then became a big, open wound that attracted flies.“I never thought such a small thing could grow into this in just three years.“This wound was small but now I can’t even walk because it’s so painful,” said Tholakele.“I need help so I can go back to work and provide for my family.”She said she lost her job as she couldn’t walk and do tasks.“Last year I had to resign. Walking around seemed suicidal.“I couldn’t do anything and was told to focus on healing,” said Tholakele.She said she went to doctors, who gave her pills and creams but nothing worked.“The wound never healed. I also went to sangomas and they told me evil people were after me. But they were not able to help me much.”Critical care doctor Dr Kitso Morekisi said the sore is related to blood flow.“We have come across such situations. When the veins become blocked, we call it a venous stasis ulcer.“In this case, surgeons will help to put pressure on the leg muscles so the blood can flow.“Managing such a condition would need compression bandaging,” Morekisi said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu2Tp7zz5gYaoVemwwhkiLk7FiwLaYqshmBEJ2IMu-NkAlc0kVzyHMiQ1s82dKkil6597LnL2HXivMdsPXbXMYuD60qtoKf08uzo_n9wc4YV4lWX3KeiVwlTF-QvgLGzHH49rIxqVqvDtIKwTLw7nXU89ybvXZDy4aGHBXd5FyBnoz9wPeidlRDWkDnXkj6Kp6hwDzqiEdJiK06G9kTwdfEdWoEfxkgaOk4ypnRGirzRhfYBsiPj1hiG82OBURQowAYrjNHfYjtL-Uw_2PIy_NNzhmKres\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP87HsUFKxYeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
