I’m a professional and all that will be put aside. Yes, I had good time at Chippa but now I’m on the other side and all I want to do is achieve good things with my new team. For now I’m all about helping the team improve its log standing and a long-term achievement will be wining trophies with it.”Abafana Bes’thende are the first KwaZulu-Natal team that Zuke has ever played for. The central midfielder started his professional career with Kaizer Chiefs in 2007 and has also plied his trade with Mpumalanga Black Aces and Bidvest Wits.He said he felt it was time to give back to his home town when Arrows called for his services. The hard-working midfielder was also linked with a move to Ajax Cape Town before turning up at Arrows.He added: “When mama Mato Madlala called I had to answer the call. It’s my home town and I’ve never played in my home town before. I had to give back to my home town and that motivated the move to Arrows.”Meanwhile, club coach Clinton Larsen said his players were highly motivated going to this match and were looking to do well. “We’ve done well against Chippa in the past and we’re looking to do so again on Sunday (today),” he said.Yes, we did well in our last match against SuperSport United and that result has motivated us. "But that is behind us. Now we need focus on Chippa and the approach will obviously be different. We have to bring our A game to make sure we walk away with all three points,” Zuke said.
