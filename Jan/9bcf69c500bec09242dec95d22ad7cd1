five-year-old child headed to the clinic. A vehicle with two occupants, a white
Toyota Tazz offered her a lift, however along the road she was pointed with a
firearm, ordered not to scream and drove with her to the bushes," Mpumalanga

to Brigadier Hlathi, one of the men forcefully raped her at knifepoint in front
of her child. Hlathi
