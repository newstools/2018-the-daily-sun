EFF leader Julius Malema has threatened to fire all his partyâ€™s councillors in Polokwane. Malema said the councillors were failing to hold the municipality accountable on pressing issues of service delivery. Speaking at Westernburg Hall in Limpopo on Saturday, Malema said EFF councillors should demand answers as to why the contractor appointed to repair Thabo Mbeki Street abandoned the project five months ago. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssP1zYTA-IbGZXNMk-flZ_e_kf1F2kGH0dU5nrQ2WlbDnzRXglZrYosZ8ZinTi4SrHjRoHJ85elwzFDmF_7JzU2AUl__5KsR1BivRPG4TfoUi0zJSIc6xgC3cPXqgxcVhSMQnt8JV2makKWLxVEeiiwzTVfsU7DfjU53T5nzLUmFVWYKUkReyBbs6zmqFbmNnumIGKFK_Lk1rjorrENATacaetv8lE9Mo6-CjEyDOI_I1PFM61njM3Hir2dusasX8y2CsTtrFhQvNw3DFGZ8Q159p8xHWw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMi_ypn8_UZxEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The EFF Student Command said they plan to be at Chris Hani Baragwanath, Ann Latsky and SG Lourens nursing colleges to ensure double the number of accepted students are registered. The Gauteng Health Department last year set a training budget for 1 020 first-year students but has since dropped it to 700. Gauteng Health spokesman Lesemang Matuka said they could not afford the R57 million needed to offer bursaries to first-year nursing students.
