When I go to war I will be going with my warriors well prepared for any process that develops. I’m ready for anything they (Jordaan camp) can throw at me.“They have already tried to undermine my campaign by saying I’m not eligible to stand. They have also said I owe Safa money, which is total nonsense. The fact is Safa owe me money. But let them throw as much mud as they want, it will not worry me in the least.”He said the fact that Safa brought forward the elective congress form September to March did not faze him: “I have the backing and support to win. If they said the congress would be held next week I would be ready.”
