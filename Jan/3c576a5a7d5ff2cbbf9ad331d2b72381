IT’S always difficult for players to resist the lure of the big bucks.After all, professional football is as much about passion as it is about earning one’s keep.It’s the reality that Benni McCarthy has come to accept since he became Cape Town City FC head coach, seeing key members of his squad leave.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstNtqLX861Rbk8KD27zHq0NXYNzJeWAm5k3efQY6NXK3QWvX9VtNYjLnqTrZ4IlQwUUYE4dcqGmK9-SLJNahkXQu82Yyzmo8sgBpfMXbY2GAncCCXPdm__Arps8YD-2_nfWwHnH1QuMlN__rJvRA31Q3OHXRUG0lDEBA6LxozsTmhdqr1TsnLPUl368iXgKXDusMJ_xuNtbisx-bxSyCGmuuVCu_ifvIxbgwRGInU0F2tNs_z7Z8FT04G6B-PI-vTXXsUDbxuoOVbGQzo21bDGjxw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDxXe17YUQfqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But it’s part of the game.”
