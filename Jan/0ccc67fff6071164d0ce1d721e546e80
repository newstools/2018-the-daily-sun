We alert them when the thugs are roaming around waiting for their next victim, but the cops don’t respond quickly.” Captain Andre Beetge told the People’s Paper: “Police are aware of the issue of card skimmers at the filling-station. “Cops have increased police visibility in all areas that have ATMs, including at filling-stations and shopping centres. “It’s a battle, but it’s winnable because the police are really reducing crime in these areas.”
