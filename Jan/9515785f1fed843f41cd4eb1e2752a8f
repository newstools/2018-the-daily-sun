ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule has poured cold water on speculations that President Jacob Zuma’s future would be sealed at the National Executive Committee meeting currently underway in East London, Eastern Cape.The newly elected NEC was meeting for the first time before the party’s 106th birthday celebration. The party’s highest decision-making body traditionally meets before the annual celebration to map the way forward and set the tone for the year.Amid calls for Zuma’s head, it was speculated that his recall would be discussed at the meeting. However, Magashule told reporters committee members had decided the only item on the agenda would be the statement expected to be read by party leader Cyril Ramaphosa at the ANC’s birthday celebration at Absa Stadium on Saturday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstUFhU5Rnk3XBmvrBqbfCfnwd80iYPOG0tABnT9a2wREXAx9LpbkiBMIvFw8GA7bhVsOG_CDfskuC6YlF90S_PQJ-B_DjTc6SdZJTmxa1jTPaVylWY8eY6vtgT2NTG6eZCooR05k04iZCEKjCyWjcdi6rAL1BPTEkshySPzpEOnOl_KrNmFnmbPkFMi1Ik65basrwyYBK3VkVjadiVHx0s3GLQb204SzEZBHdQCewEqpSjhye1ji5aI0Q-6mZ6a_04d4HB8mc85BfUCBnYcgizw0z1fJmk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHz177r3WGY9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

That matter was not up for discussion or debate.” But while Magashule shot down any discussions of Zuma’s exit, senior members of the party told Daily Sun the matter would be tabled at the meeting.One senior ANC member said: “The NEC is going to agree that national officials should look at the matter and report back to the NEC. It is just a matter of time.”
