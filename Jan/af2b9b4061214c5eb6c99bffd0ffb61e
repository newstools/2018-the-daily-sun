The people of Protea Glen extension 16 in Soweto barricaded roads with burning tyres and rocks. They complained they were not assisted at all after the storm ripped off some of their roofs. They said they were just left to fend for themselves. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuBHPdy6OF8hxncq2YS80BDkxZbMogP7C3ptzD34k22zZ4vQ23Ya2tLNk56nohpOv5ompYIQ_Ky8XS88MPVxf-feIhjNS8I6t5M7s84gBltKd-a4Y3YePotmZndX7qK5JAydLHafnGAzO6ymfNIIV9T3heLWnAzs4fZaKnHaVscdgjC86ActINZNZITd-LFJYWUe0z075wd8YI6nWKVq7n2i2NUXUCpVHLS6UL10Wgg7hVPWywhhBUDmg8jSzAs5DSTBUMGWLf7YTWjKo4BDrs6Kmx-xhU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKksiMH1gUskEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

On Tuesday a disaster management team spoke to residents and an agreement was reached, but they were still not satisfied. They told the SunTeam their roofs were seriously damaged and their walls were cracked. They said they were scared to be inside their houses as they could collapse at any time. Sinhle Mchunu (42) said: “All this is not safe and we need to be assisted.” The storm, which hit the area on Saturday, affected 1 800 people and left two dead. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant Kay Makhubele said no one was hurt during the protest and no arrests were made.
