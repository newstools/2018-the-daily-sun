ON THURSDAY, a fire ripped through their shacks, leaving many without shelter. And on Monday, residents of KwaMashu Hostel, north of Durban, took to the streets in anger. They said they were furious because their councillor, who should have been looking out for their welfare, had not set foot in the area. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssfSui2hWTaDKJDopNDZTV0ZxNPZsRvkSfsJG9RUU3_qWJK9bPAy6T9BGYm5K0k4G3sIT1ZRS0x6ltYsYsKUVFQfakmfr-wuPU9lKPdJZFy4nP-cW8RFsZVC4Jso8jrI2dRm3yI-HEOspDRcuJqY9EJzfBb04PJ0nDZPgVwF4oAnlLVSTbwGk_sd1iKDjyel5TP59Re35Qef3sjcHTPGVYNcmxYCqGB8fby6vNkaDoiwBtWeYhBWiWtfk7ks1zG9ySnQ-dI5EsHJUZh-phAeQgubBq2iQ0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPp0vA6wTn_HEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Yesterday, the residents blocked the road and railway line at Thembalihle Station with burning tyres and rubbish. The train service between KwaMashu and Umlazi was disrupted in the early hours of the morning, leaving thousands of commuters stranded.The angry residents demanded that the councillor inspect the damage and provide them with temporary shelter, food and clothes. Thabile Kunene from Prasa confirmed there were disruptions but said the railway line had been cleaned up and trains were working. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “The situation is stable at the moment and members are monitoring the situation. A case of public violence was opened.” Councillor Lindiwe Ncayiyana said she had met residents. “They are not telling the truth. I sent committee members to take their details,” she said. “I assured them the matter is being dealt with. I asked them to be patient.”
