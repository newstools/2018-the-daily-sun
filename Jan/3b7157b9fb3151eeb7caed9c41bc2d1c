accident, when they arrived with emergency services, the zama zama was
certified dead.Mojapelo adviced members of the community to stop the
tendency of engaging in illegal mining as this was violating the laws governing
the mineral resources.He said since the activities of illegal
mining started mushrooming along the R37 road between Lebowakgomo and
Burgersfort, scores of people have already been arrested, several trucks and
mining machinery confiscated.
