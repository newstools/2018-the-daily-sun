We haven’t won,” said Sredojevic.“Now we need to keep it tight at the back, improve our build-up and create many more chances and conversion ratio, as per last two matches.“This is the strategy we’ve been working on throughout the week, giving full attention to detail. We want to make whoever comes on Saturday enjoy good football and lots of goals. Happiness should be delivered as per demand of our supporters.”Polokwane coach Bernard Molekwa is not overawed by the occasions, having already completed a double against Mamelodi Sundowns.He rightly considered his team unlucky to have lost narrowly to Amakhosi last Saturday, and has vowed not to lose to another Soweto team.It’s a damning indictment on Steve Komphela’s Chiefs that they are yet to register a league victory against Baroka.Two of their matches ended in draws last season and Bakgaga have already thumped their illustrious opponents 2-1 this season.“Wins will always ignite and inspire people,” said Komphela.“But the beauty of it is that when our people are happy then they give us that positive energy. When we perform well and win, we give them that positive energy. “So, which one came first” chicken or egg?Should we perform well that we are happy or should they give us energy for us to perform. We can’t let go of that energy. We have to maintain that good energy because we have found an environment where both the players and supporters can meet and enjoy.”
