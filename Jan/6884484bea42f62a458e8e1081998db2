THESE protesting villagers from Makobe Village don’t want their chief any more. They allege that Chief Phuti Matlala, from outside Mokopane, Limpopo is not their rightful traditional leader. They want him to step down. They allege the chief was only to be in an acting capacity after Chief Harry Matala was killed in 1950 as his children were too young to succeed him. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Yesterday, villagers marched to the offices of the Bakone Tribal Authority to hand over a memorandum of grievances.

Matlalane Community Forum chairman Lesiba Dibete said: “Coming here today we hope our message will be respected. If nothing is done we will come back but not peacefully.”In the memorandum, which was received by Joel Shai of the Limpopo traditional affairs department, villagers said they want the department to intervene.
