But with the burning passion, we kept on pushing until we cracked the into the main stream of the industry,” he said.Caiphus Semenya said he has lost a great friend in Bra Hugh. “We became friends when we were teenagers (15 years). “We grew up loving music and we performed everywhere in the country.We went overseas together and Gwangwa also followed  when we were in the United States. Semenya described Masekela as a hard worker who loved what he was doing. He could do everything with distinctions,” he said.Don Mattera said Masekela’s music is healing. “He was gifted and loved God.“Bra Hugh was a living legend,” said Don.He said Masekela healed the country and the people not only in South Africa but across the globe. “Bra Hugh was a Messiah who lived and touched many people.“He was born to be a Messiah and heal wounds. He was a little Jesus in the lives of many people,” said Don.Industry friend Bra Sam Mhangwani said he thanked these great musicians, Bra Hugh and Gwangwa for giving him a chance to work with him. “They gave me a chance, they believed in me and I thank them all.Bra Sam said he is appealing to government to come on board to support the artists in the industry who have potential to be recognised at a global platform.
