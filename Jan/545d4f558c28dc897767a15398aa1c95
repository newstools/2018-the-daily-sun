The whole
family feels humbled and blessed and excited."When they realised they were going to be in the
hospital over New Year's Eve, the family planned to celebrate at midnight in
the break room."But then it turned out Maria was in labour, which
was a surprise."It is such an unusual event that $3 000 (R37 000) worth
of baby supplies was donated to the family by the hospital and its community. Both Maria and Joaquin are farm labourers and appreciated
the support.
