WITH just four games left before the curtain comes down on the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC), Golden Arrows coach Vusumuzi Vilakazi has made it clear that they cannot afford any slip-ups.Arrows will make history if they become the first club to win the title twice. Vilakazi also led Arrows to their first MDC title in the 2015-16 season but the team was unable to defend the title the following season.He reckons that happened because players were no longer hungry and had become too comfortable.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuP2zPUul3iXnm9Ryyhh1tITVXIIX01j2XbgZRjQhkXMySH4JCdWvtO9Y9vqZOu_4xWli0c1S2durUrYgkk8H1Lt3-wgNTOKTZZ9brP0-fXFzeYbXUGzBC6xA1JBCohJqiUDNTTndDRU-5RWY8Kgxz1tA5wFIHZ3V4WT-dorcv7EkySpTq5oS77XR36otl5AGMxloNbme9vYDVD2MyKb54jhZkBzv2e3LZRjBpZpN1YmWrxdzO-XTE3wSg9ujapbvOrtpRRX24fliN0hY4g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDuawHDR-zM8EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They were too relaxed and that is why we lost to Stars. “It’s a wake-up call, the race is still on, they must not relax,” said Vilakazi.The difference between now and last season is that there’s more hunger this year, he believes.“The boys are committed and are hungry to break into the first team – 80% of them are new. They were not part of the team that went to the Netherlands and are also motivated by that. This year they get to go to Spain if we win.”
