Hospital. Speaking to Daily
Nation, Peter said: "Their mother had gone to a funeral at her
maternal home when I prepared them the meal. All was well till 7pm when I
rushed them to Ambira dispensary which lacked medicine only to be referred to
Siaya County Referral Hospital which had no medical personnel when my little
girl died."His daughter, Margaret Akoth, was just three years old.Peter then rushed his remaining four kids to the nearby Bama
Hospital, praying they had the resources to save the rest of his children.But fate didn’t favour his 10-year-old son Allan
Odhiambo, who died at the hospital.Thankfully, the other kids – aged one, five and 11 – were
treated and were eventually well enough to be discharged.Meantime, Selina had been informed by phone that her kids
were in a critical condition.  She rushed
from the funeral, but by the time she got there two of her children were
already dead.It’s possible that the cassava hadn’t been properly
prepared. The vegetable is poisonous unless it is peeled and thoroughly cooked.
If it is eaten raw or prepared incorrectly, one of its chemicals is attacked by
digestive enzymes and gives off the deadly poison cyanide.
