The man was charged with murder after his arrest, but the cops have released him as there was not enough evidence for the case to go to court. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun the docket was not placed on the court roll by the prosecutor.As a result the suspect never even saw the inside of a courtroom. “Police investigations are continuing, and once there’s further evidence the docket will be submitted to the prosecutor for a decision,” Mavela told the People’s Paper. Tsholofelo’s cousin Kabareng Moreri (34) said the family was not happy, while one of her best friends took out her anger in an open letter posted on a Facebook page. The letter reads: “You must not be killed instantly.“You must get far worse pain than Irene went through before she could pass on! “I want to see your stomach and internal organs come out of you before you die.“I want your one eye to be taken out. “I want to see your nipples, 4-5 and balls being chopped off.”The friend said she last saw Tsholofelo at work on the day of the incident. “I asked her to join me and my other friend for lunch,” said the friend. “I told her she could sleep at my place or I would get her transport home.”But Tsholofelo apparently couldn’t come because she had no extra clothes to wear.
