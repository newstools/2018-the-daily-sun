    LESS
than a quarter of matrics find jobs quickly, according to economist Mike
Schüssler of economists.co.za.Those
members of the matric class of 2017 who will not be studying further, but will
be looking for a job, will not be easily absorbed by the job market, he told
Fin24 on Tuesday.“It
will be tough for them to get work. Over 50% of our matriculants under the age
of 34 have not found permanent employment and it’s not getting better,” he

is part of the process young job seekers go though. It takes long to get a
first job - even for those with a degree it takes a while. You do not get a
degree and suddenly you are running the firm."The
overall unemployment rate in SA nears 28% in the narrow sense (excluding people
out of work, but still actively searching) and 37% in broader terms (including
those who have given up looking for a job). For young people this figure is
much higher. Schüssler estimates it to be well over 50%."To
get your first job is probably one of the hardest things in life and often
takes a while. If you have not had a job, you are regarded as not having
'proven' yourself yet," explained Schüssler."Unemployment
in SA is high already, but for the youth it is higher and for those looking for
a first job it is very tough."According
to Statistics SA, only 12.8% of people in SA between 15 and 24 have a job (in
terms of the narrow definition). For those between 25 and 34 years of age, only
49.6% actually have a job; and for those between 35 to 44 years of age, 63%
have a job."My
message to matrics is that a job is a job. The big thing is to start off doing
a first job. Yes, we will have minimum wages, but maybe we have to be careful
regarding how it is implemented," suggested Schüssler."Maybe
people getting a job for the first time could be excused from having to get the
minimum wage for the first two years of employment."Another
suggestion by Schüssler is for young matriculants who do not find a job quickly
to try and do volunteer work."Maybe
ask if you can just get money for transport. At least you will still be in the
process of learning. The next employer wants to know that you can stick to a
job and perform the tasks you are given. That is very important," said
Schüssler.Never
lose hope"Don't
give up hope. Everybody is suffering and employers often prefer young people
who are a little bit older - about 25 years - as they might be regarded as
being more mature and used to the discipline of sticking to a job."He
pointed out that this is a global trend as older people tend to be regarded as
having proven themselves - whether they have done so or not. "Young
people must try to offer a service - even start waitering, just start
somewhere. The best advice is not to give up. And if you get a job, work hard.
Employers want people who are productive and efficient," said Schüssler."Young
people must say to themselves: get a job, then negotiate and work your way up.
It is not an automatic thing. Yes, SA's unemployment is high, but all over the
world young people struggle to find jobs."
