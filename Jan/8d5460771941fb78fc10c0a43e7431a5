Witnesses said they saw him beating the dog with a wooden stick and covering bloodstains with soil early on Monday morning.” Sangoma Majoko Hlungwani said dogs’ legs were used by some traditional healers to predict their clients’ future.“Harming animals is wrong and the ritual killings of dogs must be stopped,” he said.SPCA Inspector Mishack Matlou said they were appalled about what happened. “We are appealing to law enforcers to help us to deal with such cases.” Police spokesman Constable Herman Moremi said the man was arrested at his home.“He faces charges of cruelty to animals and will appear in the Moretele Magistrates Court soon.”
