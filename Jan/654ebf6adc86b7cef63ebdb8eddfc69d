ATTACK will be the name of the game when Ajax Cape Town square up against neighbours Cape Town City at the Cape Town Stadium in what promises to be a high tempo Absa Premiership derby on Saturday (3.30pm).The Urban Warriors head coach Muhsin Ertugral has hit the ground running in 2018 since he replaced Stanley Menzo, and collected a vital 3-1 win over fellow strugglers Platinum Stars last weekend, which saw Ajax move out of the relegation zone.Ertugral, who is now in his fourth stint as Ajax mentor, said the derby was special, but he is not looking over his shoulder at third-placed City.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstOcQacAQdjzcaKUJhpD17KxiyyPZTWSIhHwZtXR-NR7gQ256WSp5dO9tBqJymWlv0-IJ8zW1YJCWg4Mjlxx2zhHBsW0FdhgcPHY302hAyUYQsS776LnmjwMVuoSRrU9-gDcIU13uZ6Y1R6ZaYUnfAoy3myynvL7PIzfCtoHXm9QSrC8j7ND1e_090oXM4Err-jLIafh90FUlygGqBoztD_UO0-2_0M5mypOZ1E9SZd1Z49cvlEXf0jYUFz7QAKbi8uFyqfNOJrZnywayNqy0Cy0w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzD8uEdht_WLoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We will be offensive and attack. Apart from it being a derby we need points to keep climbing up the table.”The animosity is off the pitch between the rival club bosses. There is no love lost between City chairman John Comitis and Ajax boss Ari Efstathiou. The animosity between the rival club officials is well documented.The Citizens, under coach Benni McCarthy, are third with 27 points – four behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns while Ajax are in 13th position with 16 points.Ertugral has been in charge for three games, a 2-1 home loss to Maritzburg United followed by a similar result away to Downs and a 3-1 home win over Dikwena.But he added: “We performed well in the second half against Sundowns, and there was further improvement against Stars.“But there is still a lot of work to do. There are a lot of things I still have to work on. But I can see the improvement.”Ertugral is thrilled with his new striker Tendai Ndoro who he worked with at both MP Black Aces and Orlando Pirates.The striker scored on debut against Dikwena: “Ndoro gives us another dimension. He is a top class player. He adds value and quality to the attack and team overall. But I have worked with a number of players in the squad such as (defenders) Mario Booysen and Tercious Malepe.”
