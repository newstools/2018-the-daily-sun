    President Jacob Zuma will remain at the helm of the country after the national executive committee (NEC) of the ANC did not deliberate on his future at its meeting in East London on Wednesday.At least two NEC members told News24 that Zuma's fate was not discussed during the short special NEC meeting ahead of the party's birthday celebrations on Saturday.The sources told News24 the issue was not raised with members, who instead focused on the contents of the January 8 statement to be delivered by Ramaphosa on behalf of the NEC at the party's celebrations to take place at the Buffalo City Stadium.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsulhY3YbUKnwFYJiktybeEeL9SwXNx2gs8QzezDGxbIhAG1wXaOtaVVDqigiogavp4xSw7hCbh_IcoFjXlbCZYJ_VxhzjN0ngOuKHppVKSd62aKX1CmJiZEQqQNlglQF6AH0UrEvX8QeC-sP0oEP7jmsWNIVd4zJcfOAF1fL_x-feBItDA0Axekwp04HDcON5X7MMR6KReLaL8wZ6_XzEC4FjoPDzzfaGlEzPDccl1iCBoTvZuHO5I47cXceKiGmfasa36qXFUNVYxIuOQJ48Ieut5SB7E\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIsjwOm8I8_lEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
