The suspects had allegedly kicked the door open in one of the houses and stolen a plasma TV at gunpoint. Residents hunted them down and they were assaulted and taken to the bush, but cops arrived and rescued them just when residents were battling to set them on fire. One of the residents said: “We are gatvol because these thugs are terrorising the community.“Today we took the decision to necklace them alive to send out a strong warning to other criminals. “We tried to burn them alive but the tyres wouldn’t catch fire. “They were lucky because cops arrived while we were looking for petrol to douse them.”The robbery victim said: “Three young men kicked my door down at about 1am on Sunday and took my plasma TV. “Later that morning I hunted them with the help of the community and found them, but we couldn’t find my plasma. “We caught the two and the third one ran away. I won’t open a case against them because it’s useless. “They will come back and terrorise us again.”Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said cops rescued the man and boy from the angry community, who accused them of breaking into a house and stealing a TV.“But no one from the community was prepared to open a case against them. The man was severely beaten and was hospitalised.”
