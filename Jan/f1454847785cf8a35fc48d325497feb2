Sundowns though, did lose to Cape Town City towards the end of the month in a period which saw them score 10 goals and only conceding twice.Kekana won the best goal prize for November with his stunning strike from inside his own half against Orlando Pirates.The Sundowns captain produced yet another brilliantly-taken goal to add to his catalogue already full of stunning strikes. The 32-year-old Kekana scored the second goal in his side’s 3-1 away Absa Premiership win against their rivals at the Orlando Stadium two months ago.Kekana, who also scored a similar goal for Bafana Bafana in a World Cup qualifier in 2016, wins the third Goal of the Month award of the 2017/18 season following Polokwane City teammates’ Rodney Ramagalela and Ndivuwo Ravhuhali’s successes, in the Absa Premiership’s exciting monthly recognition awards for the best goal of the month that were introduced last season.
