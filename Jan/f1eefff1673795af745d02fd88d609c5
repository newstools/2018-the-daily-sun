"We are still on strike [and] it has been very silent on management's [side]."Tomorrow, we will be marching through the streets to let the public know what is going on." Student 'traumatised' Due to the strike action, first-year students and returning students were unable to register for courses and accommodation, said Zamisa."We have students who don't have a residence to stay at, they have to look for temporary accommodation, and the lines are just ridiculously long," she said. Zamisa added that many students were upset by the queuing and strike action."Everything is upside down here at DUT and nothing is constructive," she said. "Potential students of DUT are being traumatised by the strike because of the gunshots and things are really bad."http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/rubber-bullets-fired-during-dut-workers-strike-20180129
