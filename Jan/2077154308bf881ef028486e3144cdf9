For a group like Distruction Boyz to sell tickets at R50 was careless.”He said when it was announced that the tickets were sold out, the crowd demanded free entry.“The bouncers tried to control the crowd but they were outnumbered.“The gate was also damaged in the process,” he said.He added that tsotsis took advantage of the situation.“Many people were robbed at the venue.”Another witness told Daily Sun: “Women were forced to take off their expensive Brazilian and Peruvian wigs.“They put them in their bags as they were being snatched.“Those with expensive takkies were also forced to take them off.”Lounge boss Sphiwe Mcanyana said what happened was very unfortunate.“Many people love Distruction Boyz and I agree with those who say the tickets were ridiculously cheap.“It was the fourth time the group came to perform at my place but this has never happened before.”He said he will meet the group to discuss future plans and discuss what happened.The Boyz thanked all those who attended the event on Twitter.They posted: “We really appreciate the support, Good Morning Everyone.”The pair refused to comment about the incident.
