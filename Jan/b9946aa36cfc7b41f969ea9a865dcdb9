Nontuntuzelo said: “We are still heartbroken. We were looking forward to taking more kids this year.“I still can’t believe our creche is gone. It’s difficult to come to terms with what happened.”And to make matters worse, residents who live nearby were unable to save anything, as the fire was too strong.“When we arrived on the scene, all our hard work was in ashes, including learning materials and mattresses,” Nontutuzelo told Daily Sun. “We are talking to parents regarding the way forward. For now, we’ll accommodate some of the kids in our homes. “We don’t know where we’re going to get money to rebuild the creche. “We don’t know what we are going to tell the parents who have been promised space for their children.” Parent Nozuko Peter (36) told the People’s Paper: “I’m extremely disturbed by the incident. “My daughter was supposed to start at the preschool, but now I’ll have to leave her with my neighbour.”
