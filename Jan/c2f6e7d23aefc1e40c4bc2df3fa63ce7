The king gave Ramaphosa an ox and he asked for it be slaughtered and enjoyed at the great place by the people.The top six had arrived with three cows for the king.The party’s leaders had a busy day that started in East London, where they laid a wreath at the grave of ANC co-founder Walter Rubusana.After leaving Willowvale, they visited Mngqesha Great Place near King William’s Town to see the Amarharhabe queen, Noloyiso Sandile.
