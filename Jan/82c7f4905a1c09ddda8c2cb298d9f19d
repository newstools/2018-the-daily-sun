At this stage, we’re perusing the complaint and can’t divulge any further information,” said Rikhotso.But Mokgatle didn’t beat about the bush, revealing that four of the implicated were still earning salaries as employees of the club, while the other was just an outsider, but was involved.He said over R30 million had been wasted by the prominent officials implicated in this case “over a period of four yearsand left it bleeding”.“People have been channelling money into their own pockets by clinching deals for their business partners and benefiting from its proceeds,” Mokgatle, who also has an interest in buying the club, said.The club is currently on sale to the highest bidder after its funders, mainly platinum mines, stopped supporting it financially.“As the Royal Bafokeng Nation Development Trust,RBNDT owners of the club, we give Platinum Stars about R30m each year for operational costs. “Added to that is money from the PSL, which gives each of the 16 clubs about R12m per season.“But the club is now insolvent because people were making personal financial interest out of it. No sponsors have been secured by the club until today, and players were signed at higher prices and money pocketed,” said Mokgatle.He claims to have proof of all the allegations and has submitted it to cops investigating the matter.He said the five officials implicated in this case should pay back the money and be arrested for fraud and “wasting money belonging to Bafokeng”.It has also come to SunSport’s attention that Mokgatle has further written a letter to the Bafokeng’s Kgosi Leruo Molotlegi to immediately suspend the accused to avoid further damage to the club.
