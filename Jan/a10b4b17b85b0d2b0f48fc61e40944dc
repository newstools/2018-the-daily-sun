CHAOS erupted outside of the University of
South Africa's Sunnyside campus as students started climbing over the gates to
get into the university grounds to register.

Hundreds of students gathered at the campus on Monday
morning. The university kept the gates closed, only allowing entry to 20
students at a time in order to prevent a stampede.Students became restless and started jumping over the
gates and proceeded to run into the university grounds as security looked on.Some students also attempted to break locks to one of the
gates in an attempt to gain access.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu4Orz2rr480HK_HMHu4vWMGXDbfMqKTjSAus6ZjyaVLIohz12DTXj1DSl94giOPRBkbRFGLArOl_EbCEmzzol3vQX7tIV4_Ta-INiVYpZ4A8RUZSsJyH-MkXe_qQY_EF7xZWT42Pr6gTqdFfuL0Mm0kasFdBbvIdPngAZ1M31_REbAagG07qBVWBnf-_hHbxSNmlzKLYSUVr1oKsUTYlX3ExWd2JKdwXZGfUthD5X8ZRplLNgqhkMPWCgpogq9aacwD--9rByZwsytANlQ7KbVvPXjM48\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPyUp-CvZ7wfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
