    BARELY weeks into the job and Muhsin Ertugral is already tearing at his hair in frustration.Winless in his first two matches, the new Ajax Cape Town coach is increasingly looking like he may be regretting having accepted the offer to return to top flight coaching.And it may get worse before it gets better for the Turk, who is facing a far bigger challenge in his fourth stint with the Urban Warriors than ever before.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsszmomJmx5EKbMxmDZMgx0htkYmarpfM-mXynVT9aOZi8nwtHclhtOaQwz8LiibTyToD_KDjYJ3JQbG-s2Kg8mPxzaE6HHXGuQLKjPJ3DEGsJS09UQ3kEjQAl8C4osv-rVqo2uYaV4wD1ACaeWjWFVWkRA-ebVXrN0WU7La7IgPbK_r369HFweVtZpQ9ktqOSXMoLD1TbLapiol3njvxKqv6S6qDLaJXpQq4NLnz8-CwlEG0M8eFr-J8o07Js6vvjHUZF_e4gcDFxzprRiDv6aqzg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEFgNA0h7NQwEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They currently lie 15th in the standings with 13 points.Said Ertugral: “I always hear ‘unlucky’ and ‘eish’ – and that makes me very angry. “It’s not ‘eish’ or ‘unlucky’. When Fagrie kicked over the bar with an open goalmouth, my bench said it was unlucky. That drove me mad. No! It wasn’t unlucky! “Why unlucky? Why do you want to kill the ball when you can just lift it into the net? “That’s all he needed to do. It’s not unlucky and we need to stop babying these guys.“In the end, one more pass, like Sundowns made, would have resulted in a goal. We also got into those positions. And that’s when I criticise my players.”The extent of the crisis at the Urban Warriors suggests Ertugral’s return might not bring about an automatic solution.But there is no man better suited to the task of helping the team avoid potential relegation than Ertugral.Despite the two defeats this year, the coach reckons the team has made some notable progress.And he expects more of the same when Ajax welcome Platinum Stars at Cape Town Stadium on Friday night.“You saw the team previously, and you can see the team now,” Ertugral said.“I think we are playing pretty good football. But I’m not happy with the engine, the midfield, and the understanding of when to stay and when to go. We have to work on that.”Dikwena are also in the danger zone and face similar challenges to the Urban Warriors.They lead Ajax by a mere two points and will be looking to open up a healthy gap over their nearest rivals.
