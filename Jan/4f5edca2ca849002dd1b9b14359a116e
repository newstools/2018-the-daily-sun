MILUTIN “Micho” Sredojevic has described the Nedbank Cup as the biggest, possible chance Orlando Pirates have of silverware this season.Micho, however, hastened to explain they weren’t giving up on the league.But the Bucs coach was seemingly being realistic, seeing as his team was far from being a formidable force that can successfully challenge for league honours.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst_NSfeaPorOOZmfR9SXBjK_XCOBWqCOCn0UtZfzNfsMTdcfJNqKgbwTTN-Cy3J0IUfEyblAZYDAHKirVfvlZh6nQkX-JosZeEROShbfZFaEu5wot2e44hjojWpd7ufBfxWWA8oF7YqYKjOsulXgNWMbDXppBG8kS_JgXxx3IBm_kuffguqT6keHtg3dUSh55e7Q_Q9H2N5-fVei0wRR8tFebWAK_6Ny9bko2sdjbnO17yvca-I8MRRQpyttirOhsqvy69hpmc3QVpS5puA68CFSg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLNRvTetEivcEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It does not mean we are giving up in the league.“It’s the nature of living in the big clubs, especially when we are playing with the emotions of millions involved. It’s the demand of soul food from the supporters, the demand for trophies. How you’d have played in a cup is not important. Winning is important.”Despite winning two successive league matches the first time this season, Bucs aren’t yet quite at the level Micho wants them to be.Scoring six goals in those matches was also key for the Soweto giants, who have missed more scoring chances than most Premiership teams this season.The Serb reckons the real test of character comes when his men are able to pick themselves up from each poor result, work hard from being “better to being good”. Said Micho: “Those two victories have injected us with motivation to enter the next matches looking to be better than we have been before. There is a huge room for improvement and that thought, as well as the supporters, is the driving force behind this team. The challenge is to satisfy the appetite of the highly demanding fans.”Pirates next host Polokwane City in their league fixture at Orlando Stadium this weekend.
