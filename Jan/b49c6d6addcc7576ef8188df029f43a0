He said health professionals were taught work ethics in colleges but behave differently depending on their facilities of employment. “They know that at private facilities they will get fired, but believe that in public facilities their jobs are secured. That will change. Government is in a process to make a change and act accordingly,” added Dlamini. MMC for community safety, Vivian Chauke, apologised on behalf of the city.“All of this is under investigation. Latoya’s death will not be in vain,” said Chauke.She will be buried in the Eastern Cape at the weekend.
