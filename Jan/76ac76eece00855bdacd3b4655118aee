telling her to stop dodging simple questions. "Minister, I'm going to have to note on record that you
are not answering the question," he said.Budlender had asked Dlamini why she was contradicting
herself on record. He said that, in her testimony on Monday, she had said that
former Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza had never brought it to her attention that
there was dissatisfaction at the social security agency over the established
workstreams. "Yesterday you said it was never brought to your
attention that there was dissatisfaction... that is not true, because Magwaza
brought it to your attention," Budlender inquired.Dlamini responded that Magwaza had only informed her later
when the workstreams had been established. 'Minister, please answer'Dissatisfied with her response, Budlender asked Dlamini
again why she had contradicted her own statements. "For any impasse to be noted happened after Magwaza
took office. This surprised me because he had initially agreed." Ngoepe then intervened, insisting that Dlamini respond to
questions. "For my own piece of mind, Mr Budlender repeat the
question... minister, please answer," Ngoepe said. The minister then said she could only answer the question
later, "after seeing Magwaza's submissions". Ngoepe, running his hands acrooss his forehead in
frustration, then told her: "We cannot keep repeating the same question,
so what is the answer minister?" A defiant Dlamini said: "With all due respect, I would
like to see submissions before I would be able to respond."The Constitutional Court appointed Ngoepe to head the
inquiry into whether Dlamini should be held personally liable for the costs
incurred during the South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) payment crisis.The inquiry is investigating whether Dlamini sought the
appointment of individuals, to lead the various "workstreams", who
would report directly to her.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sassa-debacle-inquiry-judge-tells-dlamini-to-stop-dodging-questions-20180123
