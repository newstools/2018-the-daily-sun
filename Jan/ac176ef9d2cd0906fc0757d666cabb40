ELDERS, religious leaders and parents cannot stand a song with offensive lyrics. But that has not stopped young people from listening to DJ Behind Bars’ Ba monyobile, which means “she has been poked”. The DJ from Mamelodi East in Tshwane, whose real name is Thabo Mahlare (39), says people dance when American artists sing about sex, but frown when Africans do the same thing. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstDr0PV6-GB8Pbk63m46_BgCdIT2evFYPfAP181r1iuB5RUSEwJ8fJQSXfMMT4vrGfMgn9scPwdk2N_1dBpm4ys5o-GjhN9DyeYFhpqi_6tOMxNZGgoSGOjTvlrT2bpZ9O1B6oEBRx5kS9fAKghXxxqNDU4-K04wiXuQHlla3IMUJopGg7Z6vLamBTEHbACAt7NObY96Ch0bRqVrfCUSs_UDYCnAlvnOxEwd-Qwzd_W8Dh1ZxSynjTzB6HQrNi9uJVpz4H2DMd8xzPHrCG-e4ZE4d77SCY\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YRwDEwBxyakEEdkZQsoFahlaotMTLxXDJzwPbWZACkiUciM0cFK239WE7njH9W5iFZa2pI4mdx_9ecXRR5HwNZmvfzsWkb02tgtQgU3\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzB1B3o80l7mgEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I give people what they want in their own language,” the DJ said. He said although most radio stations he had approached told him to change the lyrics, the song was very popular among taxi drivers. “I refused to change it. “R Kelly sings about sex, love and magic. Who has ever told him to change his songs?“My songs don’t need air play to be popular,” he said. “People have sex daily. I’m not telling them to avoid paying tax.” Prophet Seiletji Mangena from Mamelodi condemned the song, saying DJ Behind Bars wants to corrupt the minds of young people. “I first heard his song in a taxi and I asked the driver to immediately drop me off,” he said. However, taxi driver Ngwato Selepe (25) said he saw nothing wrong with the song. “Young people ask for it and use your taxi if you play it.“The song is a conversation starter. Our clients are tired of talking about the Guptas every day,” he said.Mum of four Sibonelo Mahlangu (45) said she chased her son’s friend out of her house when he played the song. “It belittles women. The poor artist needs our prayers.”
