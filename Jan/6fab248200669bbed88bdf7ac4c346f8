recently had removed in a jar with him in the studio!Roddy Doll, who now has a waist about 51 inches wide,
explained to the show’s presenters why he had four ribs removed."To express myself through fashion. My blazers have
to be altered. I had to always have a bigger blazer and get it altered. I had
four ribs removed so that I can do up my blazers without having to breath in or
have my blazers altered. I have a 20-inch [about 51cm] waist now."Roddy currently has to wear a corset to help support his
spine after the operation.He explained that his obsession with “sculpting” his body
into his ideal went back to being bullied at school because he was “fat and
misshapen”.But now he’s feeling great about himself."I'm perfect to my eyes, I like all of the way that
I look."If you can't love yourself how are you going to
love others?"Plastic surgery has changed my life from water to
wine."The 60 surgeries cost more than £508 000 (about R8,6
million).Jetsetting Roddy Doll also revealed that he has three
partners at present.He said: "There are three on the go right now. I
live between London, Los Angeles and Spain. So sorry I'm going to be honest,
there are three on the go right now."
