The Democratic Alliance has written to President Jacob Zuma demanding that he release the terms of reference for a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture by Friday.Zuma was given 30 days from December 13 in which to establish an inquiry, after the North Gauteng High Court rejected his bid to have former public protector Thuli Madonsela's recommendations on the inquiry set aside.Zuma finally announced the establishment of the long-awaited commission last week, saying "the matter cannot wait any longer".if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstWcEYyCsj52PiPgipkoWoxVK4e6i0CTy7as2Yw_AgmnrK5MnYVWLADiT4n2edhAhfpAT76D2N3xLMp1GAOAgVj-MTomApwzeafdweqdPHFJvGSqnEBnuUZT3bB_2eCF7sAsD6cGeesg3_PleUbMXC2xpb86lQ3P73edv0tkCCaT3hU5oEHBSjNhQyJJeDXK1wjvfJYRIa834WRyLksDj98MAXydd5UPZ673p7n3PMQk3epuNXhMoEYGBmLNur_aXgxt_zG9IGdPnb41ccGb8blitDE4t0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOLV7Qb9wporEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Failure to do so only confirms that the ANC under Ramaphosa will be the same as the ANC under Zuma."Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo will head the inquiry.Zondo was recommended by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, as recommended by Madonsela in her report.NEWS24
