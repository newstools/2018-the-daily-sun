I know myself to be a very warm person.”Moseneke was referring to a plea made by Mosenogi  to Mahlangu asking her for an extension in the Life Esidimeni termination.Moseneke said: ”He pleaded with you. He actually wrote to you that it will be dangerous to shut down Life Esidimeni and needed an extension.”Mahlangu said she couldn’t remember the details of the email because she was admitted to hospital at the time. However, she emphasised to have given three months extension after she was discharged.According to Mosenogi's testimony he made in October last year, at least 6 to 12 months extension was needed.  On Monday Mahlangu told the hearing that she advised families to establish a family committee and provided them with her mobile number to call her with their concerns. Mahlangu said she doesn’t recall receiving even a single call.Mahlangu was further asked about the testimony of the Former Head of Department, Barney Selebano.Selebano testified in December last year that he didn’t want to go ahead with the implementation of the project but he was scared of Mahlangu.Mahlangu said this was incorrect.
