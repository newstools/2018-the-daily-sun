Reading out loud proved to be the best way to remember the information, the study found. That "confirms that learning and memory benefit from active involvement," study co-author Colin MacLeod said in a news release from the University of Waterloo in Ontario. He's chair of the university's psychology department. 'Active' words become more memorable "When we add an active measure or a production element to a word, that word becomes more distinct in long-term memory, and hence more memorable," he said. MacLeod's earlier research involved how writing and typing words enhanced memory retention.As for the "practical applications of this research", MacLeod said, "I think of seniors who are advised to do puzzles and crosswords to help strengthen their memory. This study suggests that the idea of action or activity also improves memory."That adds to existing knowledge that "regular exercise and movement are also strong building blocks for a good memory," he added.The findings were published recently in the journalÂ Memory.More tips on improving memoryYou can also strengthen your memory by doing the following:Reduce large amounts of information by categorising it into smaller chunks.
