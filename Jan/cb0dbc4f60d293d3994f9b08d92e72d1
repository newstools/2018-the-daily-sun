After scaling Mount Kilimanjaro, SA singer Unathi Msengana let fans in on what the experience was like through a post on Instagram. “I’ve been struggling to articulate my emotions about this trip until I spoke to a friend of mine this morning @thabo_shogole who put me at ease as he shared his intentions of summiting this beautiful mountain and world and African Heritage,” the muso wrote. The singer, who was still in Tanzania when she found out about the passing of jazz legend Hugh Masekela, added that the trip took its toll on her emotionally. “It was a very emotional trip for me because of the alone time I had but more so in losing Bra Hugh the day after I summited and obviously constantly thinking of the incredible Gugu Zulu on my trip.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsswsKgtQy9wsOYdq30V9Bi6ygr0ck3i16gN74tEb-Yb8B0dp1AaiDQvK4I4epMZZhC6iHzKxif13SBZH6e-VyuC-eELWArhDgdViP7U-sDDHqBY0IZ8tKJLjz-2zn8I05m2Ev_duSoQFT9UU4QZL7Vn0l0kCB9cZX9spWCal0VmwJBzW0hAVtfaLmCyuMIuxp6bFc-s4Qs5vxYwijwBZLlb3LM7NgjnoSFuk59rTi7D9QAKfOICPwbYTwhl_EFhml_1oDeU5W9w1WlQ4rpPddRmyup02XBMXxyVrA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBkc1CTrA1K1EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It was a very emotional trip for me because of the alone time I had but more so in losing Bra Hugh the day after I summitted and obviously constantly thinking of the INCREDIBLE Gugu Zulu on my trip. I met Gugu through his wife @letshegozulu as we are old VG girls and that's how long I have known and loved them both. I communicated with Tshego on the trip which was special for me too. I realised that we are NEVER alone and that we are living on borrowed time. So these shoulders we stand on. The shoulders of GIANTS, alive and resting are powerful shoulders. These shoulders give us strength to be the very best versions of ourselves that we can EVER be. So to those who have shared their fears, hopes, reservations, excitement, anxieties around summiting her gracious Mt Kili with me. We owe it to them. Their belief in us will never waiver. It is now our time to explore and discover this beautiful continent of Africa in all her splendor and challenges! ??????????
