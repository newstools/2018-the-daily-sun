ZIMBABWE’S Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party
leader Morgan Tsvangirai has rejected reports that he is battling for his life
in South Africa where he is receiving medical attention.Reports last week said that Tsvangirai's situation had become
dire, with NewsDay saying that his doctors had indicated he had "three
months to live".Tsvangirai, a former prime minister, announced in 2016
that he had been diagnosed with colon cancer and had begun chemotherapy.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstjWvBDi3ssQuTWcYY4sP1HP4LuoEzPrJQI7mB7y6xoib9KfIe_-yYZPL0d3gHYozMDMoGMe_-Po_U6vG8e5PuSjfGAB9bg410ZpfHb3eC6DmTlFRYMU0zzjjlU5Ro4NgBLGUkVPUrt38RqdCCyuoKji0PFFp6AgwBl9lIc1xUkriScDKxjjspBVgHFDJQ84ZNnOLyxtnZKy82iKXh5QAhQjrj1ZQq5oWb1_SQqv09-Et097rEwA5kQ2t-B4Mj5qXNTnFEydhksAbLl2biVy0huYEcy0jzZjniPlQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMnbIoaUgkjnEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

opposition leader was "alive and responding to treatment, his health
continued to deteriorate".Tsvangirai, however, took to his personal Twitter page -
also quoted by the state-owned Chronicle newspaper
on Friday and dismissed the reports as "speculation".He wrote: "It is all speculation. No deadline has
been given to me and my family. I am getting routine attention like any other
cancer patient and i will be back in Zim shortly. Meanwhile lets all register
to vote and those who can attend the alliance rallies. Do not mind the
madness."Tsvangirai also thanked his supporters for wishing him
well and urged them to register to vote for the forthcoming elections."Thank you for your thoughtful wishes flooding my DM
(Direct Messages). Love strengthens even the weakest soldier on the darkest
path. While we are not progressing at a preferred speed, we are neither
stationary nor marching backwards. We are staggering ahead for complete &
in unit for the nextgen (next generation)."Tsvangirai left for South Africa on 5 January for his
routine check-up, and according to Daily
News, his party had not indicated when he would be back in the country."His visits are becoming more frequent and
prolonged, causing prickly debates in the MDC Alliance which is fielding
Tsvangirai as its presidential candidate in the country's harmonised
polls," the report said.President Emmerson Mnangagwa indicated while at the World
Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland last week that the country was
expected to go for elections before the end of July. http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/ailing-tsvangirai-rejects-reports-he-has-three-months-to-live-20180130
