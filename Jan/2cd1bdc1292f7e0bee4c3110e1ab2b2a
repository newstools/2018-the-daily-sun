    QUITTING is the furthest thing on Gavin Hunt’s mind.In fact, the Bidvest Wits coach says he would have to be dragged out kicking and screaming from his position.Never has Hunt been under so much pressure or “embarrassed” in the many years he’s been a coach.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstctJsg8R5ZLHUuiqWSaklTHt2Oab2B_GBvlZUBS4wr65eJFsE_xq5FkUpQ8LsCsuggS1vNP73mrRTye3XmwVddjv8tsoRjoJbWg-kVpWUBIwui8BGm9sgE0keHa4IolJ8jJkSZv76aHsYzvJ6EnKv91fS8MYISiOk1spFJ_b6o40jFv61658USqRGbjhjBueXkz2xLdhWHhBWtIDFTEFsfluY1jFxeymsx8heqjC6heLoQcmbrScFRTep-jn4QvZ6caP--Ki8CxDY1LIQA5DPQ1w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLz6VXQm_kk7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

You’d have to chase me out of here, boet,” said Hunt with a chuckle.“You’d have to pull me out with a horse and cart. I’m not quitting! Of course it’s embarrassing. I’m embarrassed for the team, the club, for myself. I’ve never been in this position in my 25 years as a coach in South Africa, never in my life.”Admittedly, panic has already set in for Hunt, though the club has backed him to turn things around.Said Hunt: “Of course I was pressing the panic buttons. I do with every game, even when we were winning the league I was panicking. We didn’t do enough business at the start of the season (transfer window) in my opinion. Now we are doing business. We have to freshen up.”Despite the midweek win reprieve, Hunt has quickly shot down suggestions they’ve recovered from their slump, insisting it’s only been one win.He reckons it’s going to be tougher against Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm).“We’ve only won one game. I can’t say the famous quote; ‘We have turned the corner’,” he said.“Let’s win a couple of games, if we can. I’m just trying to play to win and nothing else at the moment. We’re playing Chippa away. "They are the most improved team in the PSL this season in my opinion. They’ve made some good signings and I’m under no illusion of what’s going on down there. They beat us 2-0 here in our last match. The lack of goals, however, remains Hunt’s biggest worry.Defender Bongani Khumalo, who netted the opener against United, will sit out the Chippa match through suspension.But the threat of Onassis Mntambo, who scored a brace for Chippa on debut, looms large.
