I managed to escape with my son.“Moments later, I heard people calling my name, saying my shack was on fire.“When I got back, my place was in ashes, and my boyfriend was gone.”Ntombifuthi said her boyfriend called her sister the next day.“He said the fire was caused by a burning candle.” “Why did he run away if that was true?”Police spokeswoman Constable Cynthia Mtshweni confirmed that a case of arson and malicious damage to property has been opened for investigation.Anyone who knows the whereabouts of the suspect is asked to contact the local police on 017 647 9666.
