We demand to be treated the same. The whole department has uniforms – why not us?” He suspects someone is taking them. He said he had reported the matter to his manager several times but nothing has been done.“I thought I would get answers after I told my regional manager that I didn’t get a uniform but nothing has happened.” Health spokesman Thabiso Teffo said the matter is been investigated.“We have forwarded the matter to our office in Thohoyandou.”
