MUNSIEVILLE residents cheered yesterday when Police Minister Fikile Mbalula announced he would deal with local cops who were corrupt. Two station commanders from Kagiso and Krugersdorp in Mogale City have already been moved following an outcry from the community. People took to the streets a week ago claiming local cops were working with criminals. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvOUlGgZRIzYfu3NXVkT_hOIcSctpWO5x7hND5Q0CcCfTB3z74RfPM5KUCrxT1_OnFF2iJ-cLSWnvHWKid3OcwXrudRZs2_CIZIa1u5RA6lyC--jlAB3BP_ClLUbV4Vo_VddfhXTjEi86ZZjLLiUkhSUM3iNf491e2NOHm9pO8nZL3Q-Jrizm7Oq0aGPKq7kzmAcDDpSn-98ijW1B4wRiRvvf03Ez9RD1-2_v-QTyAPIhUHw0iRyktAPjqS5V4nVLtJP6UQ4sCfAMke_72msfdFPMiKA5U\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzD6AGGyqjEQCEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He said all the citizens of the world were welcome in Mzansi but they could not be here illegally. Major-General Fred Kekana was yesterday appointed the new cluster commander in the area. Mbalula said: “I’ll be back in the area in three months.” He warned the community that illegal activities should not be fought with illegal acts. A house that was allegedly used for illegal activities in Krugersdorp was demolished yesterday and the minister said more would be destroyed. “These buildings must be sealed and closed down. A programme to retake buildings back from criminals is going to unfold here and in surrounding areas.” Tsoki Mongwegelwa (44) said they had waited a long time for action to be taken. “Now we are hoping that things will start going in the right direction,” she said.
