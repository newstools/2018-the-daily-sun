When you open one side they come from the other side. When you close one side the other is open. So, they are actually a brilliant team.”Ertugral continued, “The first 20 minutes we could have had the second one (goal) and maybe the third (goal). Obviously after that we were on the back foot through a penalty.“Immediately after that we were disorganised at the back, but we came back in the second-half, we had three chances again. They did well but in the end, this is not our class.“We need to work on our patterns so we can be as fast as possible against teams we have on the lockdown,” Ertugral added.Ajax currently occupy 15th position in the standings and welcome fellow league strugglers Platinum Starts to the Mother City for an interesting match at Cape Town Stadium on Friday.Kick-off is at 20:00.
