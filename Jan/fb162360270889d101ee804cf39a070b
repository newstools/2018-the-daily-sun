    ZAMBIAN foreign affairs minister Harry Kalaba has
resigned because of "swelling" corruption in government and
criticising President Edgar Lungu.Kalaba, who was appointed in 2014, wrote a scathing
message on social media yesterday, lashing out at the state of the ruling
Patriotic Front party."We cannot proceed to manage national affairs with
cold indifference when the levels of corruption are swelling and being
perpetrated by those who are expected to be the solution," Kalaba wrote.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss7NsATf198zSbEhXZfmpoCrLbOR-aC_qWTxPdEKO0eWIAzwc49i2h8YCuWRDVVZfy9525KESOsDDlmuTrwWy0FRWxJ3rcn2S9V6iHJ5k_c5svmqNEkRKKgfGLwSzVVh7yz8Acm4tPfXpS2DB-2uKQAOL6dbpkOaNBzVTdhB1yoMmI3_McffdfIOse_3z_XA4D_FDIewYpJplHyjDMfI-NlOnFYvR40zsFLui2Dc7DWTMTmzJwDDsPvKe7hC8DX-OBT8s7YWUdVqYSWmDD7wpNVc79V_dvSRv5RKA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEKMOcoSyOy2EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

to be the reason we are holding power."Kalaba is seen as a successor to Lungu, but Lungu is
planning to run again for office in 2021 in a bid that his critics say is
unconstitutional as he has already served two terms - the maximum permitted by
law.Lungu became president in 2015 after the death of
president Michael Sata and was reelected in 2016.Kalaba said that he had submitted his resignation letter,
but the presidential spokesman said that it has not officially been received."We have not seen his letter. He has not brought it
here," Amos Chanda told AFP.Kalaba was not available to comment, but foreign ministry
officials confirmed to AFP that he had resigned.Transparency International's Zambian representative
Reuben Lifuka said that public anger over alleged graft was growing."The resignation of Harry Kalaba vindicates many
people who have expressed concern about the levels of corruption," he
said. "It's time we see real action from President Lungu."Recent allegations of corruption have focused on the
state's purchase of 42 fire trucks for $1 million (about R12,3 million) each, a
$1,2 billion (about R14,8 billion) road project and the purchase of 50
ambulances for $228 million (about R2,8 billion). https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/zambia-foreign-minister-resigns-complaining-of-graft-20180103
