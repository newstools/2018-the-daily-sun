they had been enjoying a New Year’s party when death literally fell out of the

leapt from his flat on the eighth floor, apparently with the intention of
killing himself.Yevgeny succeeded in dying – but landed on the
21-month-old boy, killing him too.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstv08j-ujFnW7exnhKC16gxmL7QdRunqrTWNnYk0hPz2WiOubumtH6M6_h2tpl1-As3wK5buZatQIGQZpwhWf-lPrV4x7GRvJngSZeHVRjOGARmejnSnfEPcWkTHyw730d_-3jCS2NYTXq_2rmPuZe6OVi4eBNxWEG_Vv930kM57WLHQfMbZ9CLV1Ga7aX7SZPmmeJs4gG6FN2dZS-xWFwodhbfmRHm9-1oXOChxEPJ-WEOOO7-oqPnVUK4TH2xPUTD9hMAGYC2H3ULsTrt9fEucoW_rzB6VL1K9Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBYKEUKEULaIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Mirror, this incredible tragedy happened in the town of Zaporizhia,
southern Ukraine.The unnamed boy’s mum, Anna Polishchuk, was still inside
the block of flats. By the time she discovered what had happened, paramedics
were already desperately trying to save him.Neighbour Sergey Borisov is quoted in the report as
saying: “I heard a loud thump.“Then the boy’s mother rushed out.“She ran to the ambulance where paramedics were seeking
to save the child, and understood everything instantly.“I had to shut my windows because there was so much
agonising pain in her screams.“I just couldn’t bear hearing them.”Senior paramedic Vitaly Reznikov said: “The man who
committed suicide fell right onto the boy.“The toddler crumpled from the strength of the hit.“We tried to reanimate his heart and lungs.“The boy died inside the ambulance.”Cops said they were investigating why Yevgeny committed
suicide.
