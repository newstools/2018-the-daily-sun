When Aggy first started her company, it was called Cakes by Aggy.“I struggled when I first started but I persevered. While it was not easy, word eventually spread, which is why I now have a great clientele and want to expand my business.“At the moment I still operate the business from my home in Theresa Park, Tshwane.”In March, Aggy will be opening her first bakery in Brits, North West. It’s why she rebranded her business to Cakes n ol Treats. “I decided to open a bakery first, which will later develop into a confectionary, but I will still offer a variety of handcrafted sweet treats, cookies and cakes.”Aggy is also busy in the taxi industry and is a Forever Living products distributor.“I work hard to make sure that I do everything with love.”For more information, email cakesnoltreats@gmail.com.
