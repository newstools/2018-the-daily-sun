She heard the baby crying from the pit toilet and called her sister and the neighbours. The suspect’s aunt, Lydia Maota said: “We were not aware she was pregnant. We only found out on Thursday when her cousin called us,” she said. The suspect was granted R1 000 bail and the case was postponed until 12 February for further investigation. The baby was taken to a place of safety. Packet Seaketso, the provincial secretary of the South African National Civic Organisation, said: “We urge government to intensify its programmes for pregnant women. We believe people like Refilwe must go through counselling.”He said Refilwe should have given the child up for adoption.
