what steps they will take regarding the matter.An investigation was launched by the DA after a report by a
subcommittee headed by DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen revealed serious
allegations against her.De Lille is not the only official from the City facing heat.It has been reported that City Manager Achmat Ebrahim and
Transport Commissioner Melissa Whitehead will possibly face disciplinary
charges following the investigation.However, the bulk of the pressure lies on De Lille to
convince her party before the end of the day why she should sit on the mayoral
seat.Â
