On Sunday, he did it again and we all laughed. I then heard a noise from the streets and remembered he was being hunted by some gang members. “My son refused to hide in the house and chose to run away. I know he did that because he was trying to save our us from any attack.”Matshiliso was shocked when her husband, David Mothai (47) told her their son was found dead in someone’s yard.David said: “Someone who knew him came running and said Tshepiso had been killed. I ran to the place and I saw my son’s leg hanging on the fence. “His body was lying in someone’s yard. It looks as if he was trying to jump the fence and his trousers caught on the barbed wire. “My son was going to start his new job on Monday and was looking forward to it. He was planning to put a fence around our yard.”Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said three suspects were bust for Tshepiso’s murder.“Three suspects aged 19 to 21 have been arrested and charged with murder by Bloemspruit police. The victim was allegedly hacked with a panga and had wounds on his head. The suspects will appear before the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court soon.”
