I hear BOP TV.RIP Ntate .— Mathanda (@MathandaNcube) January 18, 2018R.I.P Mr Lucas Manyane Mangope , Bophuthatswana pic.twitter.com/L3FgX1JH0A— KE SHARP (@danielmarven) January 19, 2018#LucasMangope For someone who grew up In bophutatswana..I have seen the development that Mangope brought to his people that ANC will never achieve.Mmabana,Unit houses,Your parliament in Montshiwa..your legacy destroyed by the ANC because of Popo Molefe...You a Legend Morolong— Mr Van Peeblez (@VanPeeblez) January 19, 2018Though his developmental initiatives cannot be ignored, Lucas Mangope was a ruthless apartheid stooge on those who opposed him. He literally broke our village of Mokgola apart into two. Our people lost lives during the resistance against him— Mk (@kmos007gp) January 19, 2018
