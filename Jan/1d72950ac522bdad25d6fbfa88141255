The unfortunate part of it is that I won’t able to fight on South Africa soil since I was banned,” he said. “This would be my third ring appearance and I’m looking forward to a tough contest against Didier. We met before inside the cage I gave him a hiding and now he’s coming to my territory and I will defend my title,” said Moyo.Moyo, a former World Boxing Association Pan African champion, says he missed the boxing ring while competing inside the cage. “I missed the boxing ring a lot as I enjoy fighting in the ring than in the cage. The cage is two times bigger than the ring and it takes time before getting physical with your opponent, especially if he’s scared of you. While in the ring you get the punches rolling a minute after the gong,” he explained.The hard-punching champion says that he will not drop any of the two sport as he will compete on MMA and boxing at the same time. His boxing professional record reads six wins, five defeats and two draws, while the challenger has equal victories and two losses. This would be a second title challenge for Didier following the fail ABU title attempt against Ruann Visser in March last year
