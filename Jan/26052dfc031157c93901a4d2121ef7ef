ON Monday, local cops spoke to Matthew Goniwe High School pupils in Khayelitsha, Cape Town about bullying. Captain Ntandazo Mncanca warned them it could result in a criminal record which would make it difficult to get a job. “If there are any bullies here, you must stop it now because it doesn’t make you a better person.” Mncanca said bullying could lead to violence if those who were bullied fought back. “The result of people fighting is a criminal record. We will come and arrest you.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvpOUb7eDYeelVxym5pcLqtjxwEdUPqGoanyED9scOLfvViPivzzEIaP4munwMv3QMy66648C8gFNqOk5139IjFmvf-hyEi_H4-bw2vdubcPq_ggbvCDPyC1_1cWGwAOvblUeNro8PHyBcpQZ2x4f_lBrUi2fIE1iTZPFv8rT6Qtf_KphMj8cF-yvx_5XgZpZEWPC0cIJCdk6-fDiu0AFd-hUMzBw6bGYKocqZzXE_uuA3i9-NatbnSHkW6CLLOVcmUBcXGzg8gJNxf5IRNMIg7asfn6s8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP487iAtUUkyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Focus on that and stop bullying others.” Mncanca said police will surprise pupils by visiting the school premises and searching for illegal weapons. “If you are carrying knives, guns or dagga you must stop that because we won’t tell you when we’re coming.” He said once pupils got on the wrong side of the law, police wouldn’t hesitate to arrest them and their photos would be put on the school wall for everyone to see.“Do what you are here to do,” he urged. Grade 10 pupil Lihle Mayeki (16) said bullies only stop if they are expelled.Principal Mzuvukile Ngumbe encouraged those being bullied to come forward.He said residents should work with the police as they can’t do it alone. “These kids are theirs. We need to work together so our children have a good future.”
