    THESE villagers say their rubbish has not been collected for months! The people of Ga-Matshwi, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo, told Daily Sun they had not even been supplied with bins by the Greater Letaba Municipality. At best, their rubbish is left on the streets in plastic bags, and at worst it is thrown on informal dumps. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsssvat3PlZISqQF6DW7i8ibZJD7FVUusBuZAh7MOMRsuPCdLfQxH6bNZ2Vf4NFnKYEaxbxnRBpS_HMOGsmQTIhcqNCLOomrZiK5M3aijx8zPkC6rFT7BaMPprRGonK7r47AEOZLV8Zqa5Hmi5f06iLMrA4VDvPPcxM5DnYQtSKXbQyDO-yVEflHhflqMlklv_KG9obPTkM8K8Yg7jWxjB0axZsYymhgszOI3BWxaHGn9FtIw8G-aVSds3Qcc-eE2WNCPdycplyu-9VYyq-cDfqz4XvWdw4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMc7dypx5ayeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

A 32-year-old concerned mum of two said one of her kids got sick after playing in the rubbish.“I’m now afraid of letting them play with other kids on the street,” she said.“At first we used to burn the rubbish, but it didn’t make any difference.” A 28-year-old man said if the municipality did not collect the rubbish, residents would take matters into their own hands. “We know the government only listens when we barricade roads and burn tyres and that is exactly what we are going to do,” said the angry man.DA councillor Timothy Maluleke said the municipality had to provide residents with skip bins and the party would write a letter to Mayor Peter Matlou. Municipal spokeswoman Lovers Mainetje said: “The problem is when we put skip bins in the villages people burn them, but we will investigate.”
