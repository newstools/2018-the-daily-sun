SUPERSPORT United coach Eric Tinkler has lashed out at his players for committing schoolboy errors in their 2-0 defeat to AmaZulu at Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium on Saturday.Usuthu strikers Siyabonga Nomvethe and Ovidy Karuru took advantage of silly mistakes by SuperSport’s defence, led by goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse.The former Kaizer Chiefs shot-stopper gifted the home side their second goal when his goal-kick fell short and ended up at Karuru’s feet. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu6KGCuKCtg5SFFr739CouLh4qehjPycIEHrIKQQKqiKW5ha-3O1dq7TQE8PbifmNa52-D8eFuMAEhrBYK1qTgw6JlKrdr4MBAHoFvOt76xrlywj1PxyeB3gZPX3Pb6esEYy8Mtw7ELk2Jqhm3da15WcdShKCvN_Q8KqhqliHZtJBI6a72rEhAxPSF_dxxYjSo5WWCLaAdWs7uOXRoCXcRqXU6A5U1SIgZDbYBs8Rl7oOJOe7J2uJSq9ZCw7qJEwkOx_bzntIyaWPDHaSrJ2hsMqg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzECEQszhd1ajEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Pieterse’s fellow-defenders also failed to clear a ball to safety, which landed at the unmarked Nomvethe’s feet for an easy tap-in.Tinkler stressed that such mistakes are unacceptable.Said the coach: “To be honest, we lost a match we weren’t supposed to. We had enough chances to score and win it. I must admit Ama­Zulu showed more hunger and desire than us. My players lacked that, they kept making individual errors. “Right now games are coming thick and fast. I don’t have time to fix all these errors. They are really costly, it’s very disappointing.”United came into the match high in confidence after winning their first match of the year, beating Maritzburg United 1-0. That win ended an eight-match winless run for them. But Tinkler’s charges have now lost three of the four matches they’ve played so far this year. The coach said their six-day camp in Durban had been a let-down, as they failed to reach their target of collecting at least seven points from three games.They also lost to Golden Arrows by a single goal last week, followed by the 1-0 win over United before their encounter with Usuthu.The former Bafana Bafana midfielder hopes his side will bounce back at the expense of Polokwane City when they meet at Lucas Moripe Stadium ton Tuesday night (7.30pm).“This trip has been a huge disappointment for me. We failed to reach our target. We were lucky to win at Maritzburg. “But there is no time to dwell on this trip. We have to shift our focus to our next match on Tuesday (tomorrow) to turn things around.”
