NKOSINATHI Mbanjwa’s family has not seen him since he was kidnapped in August last year.  The 21-year-old from Tshepisong, near Kagiso, Mogale City was taken by an angry group of people. This was after he was accused of being involved in the murder of a shop owner. Devastated mum Joyce Sithole told Daily Sun her son regularly appeared in her dreams and asked her to save him. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssOw6o1ZYbYl1W6_-kVOpIk-DXKs2RCjl7ggQeddoayJuQLsaUmCDVhotmgIwBt4Ikb3PUISuEeEPNputw4a_IqVjFVQat7U1r9NBiAZdEw8xRA2yuAW6EiyD-xPjbFplQX0lEcUnI-gIC97U6DTvmxGvAWvfh0i-7c8QBf8pmpNvcYXo7TyPppBo5bUIlLeu0BUHFYzGl2M35QJrufv7gyyRLCCY3C90R5jjjoZ-jgLT9VS_7J8Nh5zm0A_iAivYhKyTs1nKgw35TN_9Vcn6IO7lq_Dl0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzD4bxujMJ3iaEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Joyce said she visited a sangoma and a prophet who both said her son was still alive but they couldn’t say where he was. The mum said on the day of the kidnapping, friends of the shop owner swooped on her son and his friends and accused them of the murder. “The other boys ran away but Nkosinathi tripped and fell. They grabbed him and put him the boot of a car. He hasn’t been seen since,” she said. Captain Solomon Sibiya said they were aware of the case. “We conducted a thorough search for him but we couldn’t find anything. “A case of kidnapping is still being investigated.”
