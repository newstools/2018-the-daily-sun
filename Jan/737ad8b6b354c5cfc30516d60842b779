Local star DJ Tira has released a statement addressing questions about former Afrotainment group Big Nuz. “I really feel like I have to say this. I’ve ignored these questions for too long. Where is Big Nuz? When is Big Nuz album coming out?” Tira wrote, adding: “Firstly Mampintsha, Danger and I, we are fine. There is no bad blood. Big Nuz has a New Managament. So its NOT DJ TIRA’s call to say when should Big Nuz album be recorded, etc (sic).” In the statement Tira went on to say that he does not know what Danger and Mampintsha’s plans for 2018 are, but added the guys are always welcome to work with Afrotainment in future.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstmza2bI9caE2YyuAVoALqyKDCyV9yGU5bC7MXJ03hl_toVdp03uGbEDo8nMdMY2IxHF902ofIawHXJBLGisLr76yhd4YWYCKZpsft2UBNgU7Vu35RngWWKoatKPzeZZLkYPI_7PF6OwTR-_jT0pxJsx2Hd36OU_6INaB9FubEzv8tgPT1JH7zU6jE98rY70stnEO-Mobwalio7QKTDDwjHf1I7WqAWVor1VGQb-DstouFtu-EwRA5jnLOz-QBOX8rmm3Mu-pB3lDMR-T19_TwK9dADf06_N7SFMw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIkARJ7nUkSnEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
