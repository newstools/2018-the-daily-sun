TAXI drivers and owners from the Pietermaritzburg Taxi Owners’ Association say traffic cops must stop hiding behind trees!They have written a letter to the Umsunduzi mayor, Themba Njilo, claiming they are being harassed by traffic cops who hide and ambush them.“They must stop us and give us fines and not hide in trees, because we cannot see them. The next thing, we get fines we know nothing about,” said SA Taxi Council regional chairman Bheki Sokhela. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssx_YX1XEZ1oOpXnQr49V4yhb3QTlwj0ss8-eR6aeQoyu0AGLdY0fGHYwzEXaI5t_8jdmE9ZnyeEM3XGXE0UsOSQ4o8_2BgSp1RcFnd5pg2MWquIUtcI7ra5NNykn-cCAPeBXj4SdKNeCUIi_ariZrq3EHvpCKyTJpC0L1WQIweLdbmLY8LLuphB5Nd1srx_7QVbLAne3lr7XTcufuPZWscSlR1Lz77I2aIX4Hm2H6BfHvfp-SDF71rC5dHGxBShi_fBMk6t4H2Vdol1q3NXNeqEkbib9s\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM4HpJIeEj-SEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They complained that the cops give them expensive fines.The association has given the municipality five days to respond to their demands or they have threatened to cause chaos again.Umsunduzi municipal spokeswoman Thobeka Mafumbatha said they received the letter and were looking into it.“We will not comment because the letter is still being discussed. “But we can confirm we received their demands and respect their wishes,” said Mafumbatha.
