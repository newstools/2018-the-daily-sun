Sandile Biyela (34) from Cato Manor, Durban died on Thursday afternoon after being electrocuted by izinyoka cables.Sandile’s sister, Zibuyile Biyela (44), pleaded with cops and paramedics at the scene to release the body to the family.Zibuyile said if they took the body to the Buhleni Baptist Nazareth Church’s inkosi Mduduzi for prayer, the powers of their leader would revive him.But cops took the body to the state mortuary anyway. KZN cop spokesman Captain Khephu Ndlovu said police could not allow the removal of the body because the man had not died of natural causes. But Zibuyile was not ready to give up her efforts to save her brother.She went to the mortuary and pleaded with officials not to do the post mortem until prayers had been done to bring Zandile back from the dead.“Police prevented us from taking my brother’s body so we had to respect them because they said it was against the law to take the body. “We asked state mortuary officials if we could bring our local Shembe pastor to pray for the body and they agreed,” said Zibuyile.The SunTeam waited at the state mortuary for the family and the pastor on Saturday but they didn’t come. Zibuyile later refused to talk to Daily Sun on the phone.Mortuary officials confirmed the post mortem had not been done because the family asked them to wait. KZN Department of Health spokesman Agiza Hlongwane said the family had a right to see the body but that the mortuary could not release it until the post mortem had been done.“We believe the family needs counselling so they can accept that Zandile has died,” said Hlongwane. Shembe church spokesman Thokozani Mncwabe advised the family to ask their local pastor to ask inkosi Mduduzi to revive the dead man. “It can still happen but will depend on whether God has accepted his soul in heaven or not,” said Mncwabe.He said it had happened before under former leaders, including their founder, Prophet Isaiah Shembe. According to legend, Isaiah Shembe himself died at the age of three in 1868 but was resurrected after his relatives sacrificed a bull. Inkosi Johannes Galile, JG Shembe and Amos Shembe also allegedly also revived people. Mncwabe said it had not happened under inkosi Mduduzi as this was the first family to request it.
