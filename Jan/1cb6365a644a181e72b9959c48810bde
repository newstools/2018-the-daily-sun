Langa commuters have to walk over 3km to Mutual Station.“We do not know when it will get back to normal. We are getting to work very late because other transport is full since every train user is flocking to buses or trains,” said Nosiphiwo Madikane (40), from Kuyasa.“I bought a monthly train ticket we now can use on Golden Arrow buses. But we have to fight for a place on the buses as they have their own commuters.” United National Transport Union secretary-general Steve Harris said drivers will not operate on the central line until their safety is guaranteed.Transport MEC Donald Grant said: “The non-operational south-east corridor adds huge pressure to other transport. “We’re urging the Passenger Rail Agency to open the south-east line from Monday.Metrorail manager Richard Walker said: “Crime still threatens the Metrorail service. We can’t operate with the situation out of control.” Cop spokesman Frederick van Wyk said suspects robbed and shot a victim and investigations continue.
