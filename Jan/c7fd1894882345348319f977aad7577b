THE fighting over little Latoya’s death at Pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng’s church led to a number of cases being opened with the police. And last week, the drama continued when the child’s mum, Nontombi Gwam, attempted suicide due to stress over the cost of burying her daughter. However, the mum was discharged from hospital last week and the three-year-old was finally laid to rest in Ngqamakwe, Eastern Cape, on Saturday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsutt2HBEgW3Ml4-e3Jc8J3eqlJ3AnY5t20JLPOkWwqO8Zl0xz4I6U_lpMq-Fnaq8339uQfMqI3tVPu7N1EEEJ0RARauPZf2In-nnetjrqLMfP2QjoyDGgpeTWJkxg1Y3yUddbEhEeCZIEOD3apiNKLZgaKMB-xQMzbA2cSYUcfkQeh9fCYFFaRyNbHLIATucxizwrJVsVohPfdYudxMuU8SqCQvKQDKgwJNQAYsG0L1AiTMlPnTkeEQi2bxfJaEh5cwcz1rd_obCs6iao2If-pRprMilRU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDdjPoHbtYacEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Latoya died on Christmas Eve after her mum took her to the Incredible Happenings Church in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. Nontombi said Latoya died in an ambulance after a paramedic failed to give her immediate medical care. Although the family appealed to the public for financial help to pay for food and transport at the funeral, no one came forward. However, Mboro agreed to cover all the costs. He told the SunTeam: “Instead of waiting, I’ll cover the whole cost.“It’s not that I have enough money but I don’t want the mum to do something stupid.“She must know that she is loved and people are giving her support.”
