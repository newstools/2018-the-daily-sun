In the first round he made just seven appearances for the defending champions which is a clear indication that he was no longer in coach plans.His performances for Wits contributed to the club winning the Absa Premiership, MTN8 and Telkom Knockout trophies last season but since then he has fallen out of favour.Milutin "Micho" Sredojevic side are expected to make further announcements as the club looks to bolster the squad as the Absa Premiership season enters its final stretch.Transfer deadline is on January 31st, 2018.
