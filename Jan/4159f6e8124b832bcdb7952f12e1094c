    LIKE many Zimbabweans, Terry Mutema came to Mzansi in 2008 to look for a job.He didn’t find one, but instead of sitting and moping, he used his hands to create a job for himself. A sheet metal artist, Terry crafts toolboxes, baths, boilers, oil trays, chimneys and many more useful objects.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssCBW8c84gQ0hKpuk-gJn4BtwoMh791mzivKY-B-btZmL9EPWsAgaAQxxi1deNlwNLHSXrhDzd6j25k0rdaPEe65lpGqPPAOMlMWE3_g3dClw7z4OE2UA-kcUFhG54PEdSLjmvCFfXXFToO6ly4XYvOTat7_P45p3ZU_p57geftjs2DdpESsPxEm9A3dr3fAA5RIaI-F28IjNujwgx23NPn_O0p7SjS-AkHkpCqvR2WvFm1i7JOLnBaX0U5i8CzHJhANMpSGIGpuB1j6pAIUZ1GFXPeBLY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOybsHHDYiIiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Terry said he was trained in metalwork by his cousin. “I worked under him for three years until he died, and I took over the business. I have employed three of his children whom I have trained.” Terry and his cousin’s children also make wooden fences and dog kennels. Prices range from R50 to R500.One of Terry’s challenges is the thieves who steal his stock. He has been forced to hire a security guard to protect his stock at night. With the money he makes, Terry said he is able to pay university fees for his two brothers. He likes working with metal and wood because nothing expires, rots or has to be thrown away if it doesn’t sell immediately. His dream is to buy a bakkie to deliver his products. Terry said there are many things one can do with one’s hands to survive. “The tools are always there. It is a pity we don’t pay attention to detail.”
