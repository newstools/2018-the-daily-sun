has been facing a City of Cape Town investigation for allegations of
maladministration raised against her.The
statement also said that it recommends  to the DA Western Cape Provincial
Executive Committee, DA Federal Executive and the DA City of Cape Town Caucus
that Patricia De Lille be removed as the Executive Mayor of the City of Cape
Town.“Patricia
De Lille has lost the confidence of the Metro Executive, the relevant political
authority,” the statement said.“We are of
the view that the City of Cape Town requires stability, unity and functionality
- which we believe she cannot deliver.Twigg also
recommended in the statement that the proposed water drought levy be rejected
at the next council meeting.“After
careful consideration we have come to the decision that this proposal is not
viable and will create an undue burden on ratepayers.“We are of
the opinion that the City should reprioritize it’s budget as well as actively
and robustly engage the National Government on the needs of the City, as water
sourcing is their core competency.”Twigg said
that the decisions were in the best interest of voters.“All public
representatives are accountable to its party and voters, and as party
leadership we need to ensure that all deployees are acting in the best
interests of voters as well as the organization, and not themselves.“The Metro
Executive has not taken these decisions lightly but after careful consideration
and deliberation.”
