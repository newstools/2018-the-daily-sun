THE crowd at the ANC’s 106th birthday celebration on Saturday used the opportunity to make the party aware of what’s important to them.And it was not just former party president Jacob Zuma who was booed.During chairman Gwede Mantashe’s speech to introduce party president Cyril Ramaphosa, the crowd chanted “Dalindyebo”.Abathembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo is currently imprisoned in West Bank Prison, just five minutes away from the Absa Stadium in East London where the festivities were held.Traditional leaders and politicians, including UDM leader Bantu Holomisa, have called for the king’s sentence to be reviewed but Mantashe said the ANC event was not the place to discuss the issue. He told the crowd: “Please keep quiet. This cannot be discussed here. We are here for the speech.”On Tuesday, Xhosa King Zwelonke Sigcawu told Ramaphosa he needed to release Dalindyebo when he became president of the country.Last week, Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha told journalists only President Jacob Zuma could pardon the king. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstoeKvrV3Z6WvgECxLdzsbb57pB3DNRsNLPMy1QkakRmIjGVPMTeXm3VvvhihBqjW32KxaSkSL2kJXNGYhdOn3yH3zhiRCxO1Qo8jHlBqLO7SzrUUsxwtoWfXOwEBatO54pxGF6Ytnqd4n2EhFnuqjSSAzvEUoqHfgkxGDLdqZAKxSrVgt41Xl7Esd0yphUCDgR72qj4tagai6k6fXcBYWfvIE9noQflyhsCLHiNY1FolqylaUHDhx2yLFK8h9SW0iYlFrEVImaF0eo53pmDdnsmZRvXSo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBxD_pzyOuRSEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
