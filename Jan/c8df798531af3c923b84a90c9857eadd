THE gloom lifted for SuperSport United as they recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win over Maritzburg United in their league encounter at Harry Gwala Stadium on Wednesday night.Victory, courtesy of Aubrey Modiba, ended an eight-game winless streak, lifting Matsatsantsa out of the mediocre they’ve slipped into since their Caf Confederation Cup exploits.United have played as many as three matches a week, catching up with the rest of the PSL teams.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss1nDdP3QWiY8oSaYH7rD-QV9HtfwlYqkNZtPnNIepnslVRwnw7mCxRirgK6iVvwY8stgRFJ1okpJ6Sb4ozPolZBlxuCSNG-3x3WOq0P6oWkXC4ZegIENyOm8VvEVuK6WOnONosiWavN-ltA4luxj8lvpiRhXWns5a9lLFh8vR-islAcFT6DdNUARmYCpPQmuIf0bv6ayoP_8E1Re7dvHfK85WKxq94m2viQ6QPt8_8-JMn1vEbvf4-VFV2QEUFbvtUiZZf79DuU4lC29RIiGOLKg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIew0gNZJradEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The players were a lot hungrier tonight.”
