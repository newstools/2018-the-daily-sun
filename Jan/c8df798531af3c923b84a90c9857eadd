THE gloom lifted for SuperSport United as they recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win over Maritzburg United in their league encounter at Harry Gwala Stadium on Wednesday night.Victory, courtesy of Aubrey Modiba, ended an eight-game winless streak, lifting Matsatsantsa out of the mediocre they’ve slipped into since their Caf Confederation Cup exploits.United have played as many as three matches a week, catching up with the rest of the PSL teams.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstvZVF8qUlm4-gHd5vvnv7TCUNhZpRJvdeMiLuBS5si6liL6Mb70hl7Z0x2I-obwxqUJypzmHd98PSXGU3PY3h3ZYqrWsE9Etk7XKJmW3OwlVewIcf7p20pGfF2NqaB92CrzdBiWMpZm4wGzOzKmNk1EeCrAAvQYDIZfdFDsqy8a2trJCm4cPENpi2oedg1ddac9mz7bG0ZMWRF_SutJuyPPJfScvVykzKZY7T5RApKmqcqMyCNskBk4ZSwb-_aK7zhSnf0Ih0N2PF29Ji7GUVK1Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKN9vobEzUZOEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The players were a lot hungrier tonight.”
