THE gloom lifted for SuperSport United as they recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win over Maritzburg United in their league encounter at Harry Gwala Stadium on Wednesday night.Victory, courtesy of Aubrey Modiba, ended an eight-game winless streak, lifting Matsatsantsa out of the mediocre they’ve slipped into since their Caf Confederation Cup exploits.United have played as many as three matches a week, catching up with the rest of the PSL teams.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss_3a_yGN6s_DbzOqXlOfZgmgvN2EtgOJmG3yuKEYt-_sTxitRXuVUvsnPr9b4T2BYwA8NkEmJm2E9kZrVVIbPOOVdTdXPjo_ry_LC3B3JRNroDWBelf4vkvKJLkgRWFCSKzHS-o9rhh84GhUGRCmyBaf43PrCXk2YA1wGiyFG-zyOyYGajcMUIYHVeEYnFJqi2t2etKr6czFQ_P9YCgvFt-YF7uH_FNtMtj5_ideRLD_xuWTbhqfADE_i53FXJnmRSzEVV42VwFrKiNUhPBgpYYA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHiebMzS4dFNEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The players were a lot hungrier tonight.”
