Zealand Herald.The footage shows Madeline and a friend happily walking
through the crowds, Madeline’s breasts covered only in glitter. A man then
creeps up behind her, grabs her boob, and then runs off.Madeline and her friend immediately turn around, march up
to where the man is sitting with his friends, and repeatedly thump him.Speaking to New
Zealand Herald, an outraged Madeline said she and her friend had had their
chests painted at a gypsy stall earlier."I was walking to my campsite and saw this hand come
up. He got a handful of my boob. I went over and hit him."It was quite shocking. I'm used to love and
kindness, freedom of expression, equality."I was going to cover up but I didn't want to let
them win. My body and Katie's body is beautiful. It's completely natural. We
were born naked," said Madeline.
