    Do I have to take my dispute to court?A court case was brought against Jabulani for failing to pay a plumber for work done at his house. He was worried that he would not be able to afford court fees, as he’d heard they could be very expensive. Luckily, as a Scorpion Legal Protection member, Jabulani could speak to a legal advisor, who told him there was an alternative – the dispute could be settled out of court by voluntary mediation.What does the law say?Chapter 2 of the Magistrates’ Courts Rules says that disputes may be settled outside of court through voluntary mediation.What is mediation?Mediation is when a third party assists the parties involved in finding a solution to the problem. They will help identify issues, clarify priorities, find areas of compromise and come up with options to resolve the dispute.How does it work?When to refer a matter to mediationA matter can be referred to mediation before or after it is brought before a court, but must be done before judgment is given. If the trial has started, the parties must first get permission from the court.How to referParties must make a written request to the clerk of the court before and during the start of litigation. The parties involved must attend a conference within ten days to decide if everyone agrees to mediation.Giving notice If all parties agree to mediation, the clerk of the court must be notified. If the case is already in court, the court must be notified. It is then up to the adjudicator or magistrate to decide if a case can go to mediation at this point.Appointment of a mediatorThe clerk of the court, along with the parties, must appoint a mediator. If they cannot agree, the clerk of the court must appoint the mediator, as well as set a time, date and venue for the mediation. A written, signed mediation agreement must be provided.RepresentationThe parties have the right to be represented at mediation proceedings, but it’s not mandatory.Successful/unsuccessful mediationIf an agreement is reached through mediation, a settlement agreement is drawn up and sent to the clerk of the court. The agreement will be placed before a magistrate for noting. If no settlement is reached, the report is filed for the case to continue in court.The way forwardScorpion Legal Protection can give members paralegal assistance on similar matters.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/SunDefender&sz=300x250&c=2138961852&t=artid%3d3a55efce-8318-4cac-8c2a-724f424b173d%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/SunDefender&sz=300x250&c=2138961852&t=artid%3d3a55efce-8318-4cac-8c2a-724f424b173d%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>You can strike back legally too!Click here
