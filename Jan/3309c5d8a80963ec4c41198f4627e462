Cops came in and ordered us to lie down. “When I asked what was happening, I was given a hot klap and told to close my mouth. “They claimed I was hiding alcohol for a neighbour accused of selling booze illegally. All our alcohol was taken and we were beaten to a pulp. When the cops left I decided to go to the police station to report the matter.“But the cops followed us and beat us up again before arresting us.”A friend who was also assaulted, Matseko Khetsi (32), claimed: “We spent a night in jail for nothing. I want those corrupt men in blue to pay for what they did to us.”Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said: “An investigation is underway and a case of assault was opened against the officers.”
