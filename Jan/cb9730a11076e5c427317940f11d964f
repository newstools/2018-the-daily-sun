His neighbours told him their kids had accidentally torched his shack while playing with fireworks. The neighbours tried to put out the fire with water but couldn’t not save anything. He said after the fire was put out, his neighbours continued with their celebrations. Michael said the parents of the kids told him they would not be able to help him because they did not tell their children to torch his shack. “I could not believe it. I’m now homeless because of their children’s carelessness.” he said.“They were rude to me and continued to party as if nothing had happened.” Michael said the kids were allowed by their parents to continue playing with fireworks afterwards. “I was shocked to see the kids running on the streets with the fireworks,” he said. He said he was left with only the clothes on his back. “My furniture, important documents and money were all destroyed in the fire. My wife and kids are home in Nelspruit for the holidays. They will come back to find that they don’t have a home anymore,” he said. Michael is worried how he will rebuild his shack because he is unemployed. He said cops turned him away and told him to return with the kids’ parents.Mamelodi East police spokesman Captain Michael Mbewe said Michael should visit their station to open a case. He said police would investigate why he was turned away.
