WHEN she went to collect her children’s support grant in October 2016, something was wrong with her ID. Ntombifuthi Msane (46), from Mboza Village in Mhlabuyalingana, north of Durban said this was the beginning of her troubles as Sassa officials told her to go to Home Affairs and check what was wrong.“I was told I had died in Eshowe the previous month.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstgLlWonVM2SHFNvPMz-rH1Gdfb8SYb7kFa5LQs3_j2nUEKUTqoQ_sldAkBD3xpuEkgMyHvK3BLzQborwY5-CxJ5Y3EOHesOk1gLC8dAoILRZwVVO1PQO6eA-TD0fOKBfzWZ_LJy2CLG4CSEkeWWoEWnYQvxtn3RGs63E32X0he_oLSYy1vX6DCUDaMQHBR7rnvctwIU7k2FeU0n-GXByhE1KlJ3SBx_QfN-sKRA0Z1kYPMg4Anc5bPZ4c1Opjxtxw3NzgBsrK4PndXaLiXrG8KDp_vgQE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNJb29gzUvMDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I thought by last April my status would be sorted, yet I’m still waiting. When I go to check, officials tell me I need to keep waiting as head office in Pretoria is still working on my application.” Ntombifuthi said life is tough because she has small kids to look after, yet the life status problem makes her unemployable and blocks her kids’ support grant.Home Affairs spokesman Cyril Mncwabe said they usually do an investigation first when such incidents take place as they believe someone could be behind it for selfish reasons.“I will work on her matter immediately,” said Mncwabe.
