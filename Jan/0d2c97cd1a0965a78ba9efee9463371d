ABSA Premiership top-of-the-table clash between Cape Town City FC and Mamelodi Sundowns has been moved to Athlone Stadium to accommodate the Cape Town 10s.The match had originally been scheduled to take place at the Cape Town Stadium on Friday (8pm).However, it appears rugby has once again upstaged football by forcing a mouth-watering Absa Premiership tie away from the preferred venue.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvkh2c_MWmim65ZudQH-Odm0phVeFoDknPOlWxps4yXaw4rLJhHFdEd6qVOH5gNo8REXE6NO1hCaI-qlJ2UlpCw_rLFN-KQlf2MjUU7W1zN-MyTvefiGKcOUoVhOnLGsEXjbftDDhnjKQ5ue63vSFzVWE7ZdQj0EWudfdyU-kYaT-fwjJdXMC34ciYy1xRasT_JnosclxwsQyo393b3hYV4ggXuGtG03LHhwi_GGdUjKTmHNx98NM945BXiMg6UvQc98HcHs16nwAWzsGgTm_JM1w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHIYIwiPBsdnEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
