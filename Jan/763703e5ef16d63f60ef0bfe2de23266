THE grapevine has it that it’s a matter of days before President Jacob Zuma is shown the door as head of state.Sources close to the situation claim there is such a push from inside the organisation for him to exit that he might not even deliver the state of the nation address on 8 February.A senior member in the ANC who spoke on condition of anonymity said deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa was ready to take over as president.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstu2gb0tvxk6pFr8ojDLqRIWiQjaKNtyRBoZ3avC9pITCgr0pCY-A3Pu0TkwBk5bEnCERGzyMZZ0IrO-lAprncDGvXXEnQsuE-4qlL9QQotNHTTLnUNtCvwNQRP7TWnQxVCU_Fb0JDelSp_1GqqX88KU99IEfys96ig4NTC8cv5lXoM7OLeL_ECJ8q8cB2DutGY38GgSzq49o-8fDDZRyNOeLZyt5S2JAtpFTloIuxo728RFQjUacxh4uEO5bxST_8mftWbZ0mbxDrDkLbA5dLu6pAHCms\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzADFW4wlOKajEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
