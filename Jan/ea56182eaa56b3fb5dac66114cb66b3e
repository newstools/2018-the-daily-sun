His other hand was holding on to the wire that electrocuted him. He was badly burnt,” said Mbizo.An ambulance was called but took too long to arrive, so residents decided to take the boy to hospital.“Not long after we arrived, the doctors told me my son was dead. I could not move when they broke the bad news.”The boy’s mum, Nonzwakazi Dwili (26), could not hold back her tears when she spoke to the SunTeam.“It is hard to accept this. I was at work when it happened and heard the awful news when I got back home.” The family said they do not have money to bury Imakhe.Gogo Phathiswa Sembeyi (65) said: “My daughter is the only one in the family who has a job. She does not earn much and the child’s father survives by doing piece jobs.”Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: “An inquest docket was opened for investigation.”Six months ago, a 9-year-old boy was electrocuted by an illegal electricity connection just metres away from where Imahle died. The boy was playing with friends near a puddle of water when he was electrocuted by exposed live wires.
