only as RA was also arrested at his boarding house in South Kuta. Two further
drug suspects, apparently related to Karisma and RA, were also arrested.The four are reportedly part of what is known as the “East
Java prison drug trading network”. Convicted drug dealers reportedly continue to
operate their network from Madiun Prison in East Java, said Coconuts.
