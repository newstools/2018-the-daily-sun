The education and health departments made sure the kids were given proper medical assistance. But parents said they were not happy with the way officials treated them. SGB chairwoman Lucky Makola said: “We are hurt by what has happened to our kids. “There are a lot of issues with water at the school and the department has ignored our complaints. “In winter the geysers don’t work. We want the education department to intervene.” Education MEC Ishmael Kgejepe, who visited the pupils in hospital and at the school, said they would investigate whether the incident could have been avoided. “We will work with the school to see how we can resolve other issues raised.”Health spokesman Thabiso Teffo said tests were being done to find out what had made the pupils sick.
