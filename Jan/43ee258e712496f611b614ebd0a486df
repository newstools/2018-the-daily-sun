The work of DNA matching is ongoing," he said."The work of DNA matching is a laborious one, as our professionals are ensuring that every piece of the mortal remains is properly accounted for." On Thursday, January 4, a Klerksdorp truck driver apparently drove his vehicle onto the railway crossing near the Geneva station between Hennenman and Kroonstad when a Shosholoza Meyl passenger train, on its way from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg, ploughed into it.A section of the train had burst into flames following the collision. More than 100 people were injured in the accident.Those who had sustained injuries were treated on the scene, before being transported to nearby hospitals for treatment.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/kroonstad-crash-death-toll-rises-to-21-after-burnt-bodies-of-2-children-found-in-moms-arms-during-autopsy-20180119
