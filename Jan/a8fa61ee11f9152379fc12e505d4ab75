A SMALL community was left in shock after a man shot his wife and one-year-old child dead before turning his gun on himself at the weekend.  The cause of the incident in Khubvi outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo is still not known, but according to residents the family had domestic violence problems. Neighbours said they heard gunshots in the early hours of last Friday morning, but they did not know the shots had come from the home of former taxi owner David Tshiruruvhela and his wife Angela (46), until their bodies were discovered by a passer-by. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssmDiSC5uzHsmEkBEjm_e482uvGu-l9L6WHJsxHeo8qJRIABBZmNqDpEqT-qyr7xSX5fR5MyFqwOGZGGBqJCE1fE7x1_dh79XSrjAQvN5q40ET_E1QnokUtNsnD7dUS2W7Hz74WXeYV8_OrgAK-bsmNNZhJi9VwlHyyLSvQ2SfNqUor_ciU0ibOxG-x_0up51MxzvSjhBE2Vq-SJKHXH11AKFaKY4UD7Nnm0mF59Mznwo7iTlXm_oWjBUUbN96B6Wncez2345mWBsURTbpyR5ovRLOF5n8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOJbCCu4-GdGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Chief Thinawanga Randima said: “When I heard about what had happened I rushed to the scene to offer my condolences to surviving members of the family.“These things should not be happening. These days there are many organisations assisting families with problems. “We have our own court here where we deal with minor cases, but we have never received a complaint from the family.“We are going to meet other stakeholders to see what we can do.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo urged people not to resort to violence when they have problems. He said: “There are places that offer free services to solve issues relating to domestic violence.”
