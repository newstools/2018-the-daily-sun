THE missing couple’s families believe the two lovebirds were murdered.They are pleading with the killer, or killers, to give them their bodies so they can bury them properly.Langelihle Mazeka (41) and his girlfriend Nozipho Mnguni (27) went missing on 13 December.Their families from Mpola, near Mariannhill, Durban have been unable to trace them.Nozipho’s older sister, Lindiwe Zondi (34), told Daily Sun her sister worked in a restaurant a few kilometres from the cottage where she stayed with Langelihle.“Nozipho knocked off very late at night and Langelihle would always go to meet her as she had to pass through the thick Umhlathuzana forest,” she said.Lindiwe said her family believes the two were kidnapped and killed in the bush on their way to their home.“We heard from Nozipho’s work that she left work at the usual time with Langelihle.“Two days later, we went to investigate and found the lights on and Langelihle’s cellphone on the charger.’She said the two had no problems in their relationship and there was no chance of them having harmed each other.Langelihle’s cousin, Thembani Khanyezi (34), said they had searched the Umhlathuzana bush and other areas without success.“My family is in serious pain. We have accepted they no longer are alive but want to bury their bodies.”KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said two dockets for missing people were opened with the Mariannhill police.“We appeal to residents to help us with information regarding this to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111 or Warrant Officer Joseph Sithebe on 073 190 1442.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssRHaG61CITAubtzzOfDzyhvaeYWVofAX4T1AZSRRX6ondB21VmnBxA74anxb_45N_k_QKOh9GAYv9PQvPiV-jq92nLxzWrE1KH_MkhtG09tCMvPshCFC9o73vDzyOY-ms4zHudGgCrKQOKATViM2GGEQKGOV3GjjW804KC44XL8WlbWZnkhzpuxBvxYbLwD-HUl2dTcCQEufgLxV6zQrygJjDYvlVkozLqiKcojiTWTV0FTnoWIa9iv2_lpXq0PXabM_zAEN5zOB7633s-98dMSQPXGb0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFzW_mMU7EbwEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
