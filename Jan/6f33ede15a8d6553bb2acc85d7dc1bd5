information from the recovering mum fearing the shock will set her back.But it seems that some relatives have told her the tragic
news. Speaking to Daily Nation,
Phoebe said: “I hope to see my children, though I am not sure whether they are
alive or dead. I have received contradicting information from my relatives who
tell me they are alive while others claim they are both dead.” Phoebe and her family had been travelling from their
rural home in Kisumu, western Kenya, back to the capital for New Year.Eyewitnesses claim the bus driver had been speeding and
that the bus had been weaving back and forth across the road when it smashed
into a truck at about 2am.In response to the accident which has shocked the nation,
the National Transport and Safety Authority imposed a ban on night travel by
all long-distance public service vehicles.
