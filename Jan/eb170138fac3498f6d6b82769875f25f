In an affidavit on Wednesday, three-year-old Latoya's mother Nontombi Gwam, 42, explained that she initially took her daughter to a clinic, where she failed to find help. Her daughter was then taken to a doctor where a drip was administered and the doctor assured her that her daughter would be fine. However, when she woke up the next day, Latoya's condition had deteriorated. Gwam said she then went to Motsoeneng for help, asking the pastor to pray for her child and call an ambulance.   On Wednesday, the Promotion and Protection of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL Rights Commission) sharply criticised Motsoeneng, saying churches should not be considered hospitals.But Motsoeneng defended himself, saying people need "both prayer and medication if they so require". He denies assaulting a female paramedic when they arrived at the church. In the statement, Ntladi said the City's MMC for Community Safety Department, Vivian Chauke, and the local ward councillor have visited Gwam's family regularly to help with all relevant logistics building towards a decent funeral for the little girl."City of Ekurhuleni [sends] its sincere deepest condolence to the family of Gwam after losing one of their own," he said. "For the injured paramedic and Mrs Gwam, we wish them good health and speedy recovery because of this unforeseen tragic incident."SOURCE:News24
