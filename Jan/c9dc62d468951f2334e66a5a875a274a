Later I learnt he was only chasing my son,” he said. The father said on Friday the man caught his son and hit him in the face with a steel bar, leaving a large wound on his forehead. “The man disappeared after that and has not been seen since. I had to take my son into hiding because we don’t know when he’ll be back again.” He said his biggest fear was that the man might try and kill his son. “We don’t know why he’s doing this. Maybe he’s obsessed with him.” The worried father said he wants the man to be arrested as his son is traumatised and can’t sleep at night.Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said a case of assault was opened and the investigation is continuing.
