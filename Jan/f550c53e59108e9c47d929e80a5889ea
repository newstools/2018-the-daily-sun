THE squatter camp isn’t called Phuma Sibethane for nothing.Phuma sibethane is Xhosa for “let’s hit each other”.All you need to do is spend time in the squatter camp in the Vaal, south of Joburg, to find out how the kasi got its name.Community leader Maxwell Makhubo (43) said: “There are at least two fights in the kasi every week. We need a new name. Life can’t go on like this.”He said the fights always lead to serious injuries, with one or more of the participants ending up at the clinic.“We fear they might kill each other if the fighting goes on,” said Maxwell.“The residents have no patience. For example, when they get to the mobile toilet at the same time, no one lets the other person go first. They will argue and a fight will start.”Resident John Tau (39) said they were so used to people fighting they no longer bat an eyelid when fists start flying.“When we see a fight we just walk past,” John told Daily Sun.Nozie Ngwenya (36), another resident, told said: “Children see what is happening here and will eventually start acting violently.“They’ll use violence when they go to places such as boarding schools and universities.“Maybe the first step to stopping all of this is to change the name to something positive like Peaceville.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvcsEj-9Jx6xdQwFwUrrazfHW5vNiPZsbo-HXmShewXs1T1A9xWH5CIiPzccgzs102JxIbki1Z6hW-cBngR5OW9QBKyc3FcjAXVmWEF3P6zE72_JcBquRnvSEbO_gC12FAtz6S3ll8Ew4s2VhrZXEpdKYFuVd-DrM6LTQF3eCG9ugR658VS1Uk-Zb5ToCIJk19x3D8ZdxQNApAUWzPFSj4n9l0uVFDUE-kXPnGy65IMrmgzELvoCLJsAULGGh8a-lsPNQUV0AIN-l77ivFPQv9xtUzNjAA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPlct0rAA8O9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
