HE IS proud of his culture and tradition.Geoffrey Kenosi, also known as Ka-Shima, lives in Thabazimbi, Limpopo, and hopes to help preserve his musical heritage through his album African Time.It will be released next month.He told Sunbuzz he was inspired by Miriam Makeba and other singers from the 1950s.The album has 10 tracks, including MoAfrica, Tsie Ke Yeo and Nkadingala.“MoAfrika will be submitted for this year’s Satmas as it has some weight. Its African feel with instruments like marimba and acoustic guitar sets it apart,” said Ka-Shima.“The lyrics and African beat should make it popular.”Ka-Shima is known in North West and Limpopo for his singles Sananapo and Wig Ya Wa.“Senanapo was released last year and is enjoying airplay on Motsweding FM,” he said.“It’s an Afro house song that tells the story of a princess.“Wig Ya Wa was inspired by a woman who was rushing to catch a flight and then her wig fell off.“I was in an aeroplane on my way to Cape Town when it happened.“I found it very funny and immediately wrote a song about the incident. Women also think it’s funny – they sing along whenever I perform the song.”The veteran singer was a backing vocalist for the band Cheek To Cheek in the 1980s.He has worked as an administrative clerk at Prasa since 2011. He is also a second-year student at Unisa, studying law.“When I qualify I want to help artists and entertainment companies. My main subject deals with intellectual property and copyright.”He is in talks with Mercy Pakela of Ayashisa Amateki fame to work on a project he wrote. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssi0wC56AKzUCOP3WxEWWCfbOfyof2nz7c9SAbFjBiuycbX8cTyZXO9ApNoGeHOKdWgVYA-YFhE9nU_L2_Q6YITTQnXzHmP_JsX1CzPaPCJ8IqNgtkLw4VYEVyvaIYhC3QtiRlbz5gz6x7r5ubOAhHOwd4F1Uk6r9KivEybJiDN5YkTseuoH74MMqG4ecrHtEQnDIo0lrJt8k1FZpgBU6HbkZmuRaqhjw20kkQR44AIgHwXHE1GLRCGf40tyZMACektj7pbbG33ElScFwbOE5FYyDDbAZNozYK6Wg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzADb1uJiUHWMEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
