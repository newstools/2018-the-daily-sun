I then took a walk to the nearby bushes and saw lots of marula fruits underneath a tree. “I knew I had to do something about them. “I collected them and took them home. “I then peeled the fruits and squeezed the sweet liquid into a large bowl. “I then removed the nuts from the mixture and sieve it into a clean container. “I covered it and leave it for a day and the beer was ready.” N’wajojo said she went door-to-door in the village selling her mural beerThe response I received was unbelievable. People in my village bought my beer with such haste. N’wajojo sells marula beer to her fellow villagers and tourists who visit the Kruger National Park on a daily basis. Her beer is affordable as well. She charges her customers about R150 for a 20-litre container. A 2-litre bottle costs R10 and 500ml costs customers R5. Customer Salimina Shivambu (61) said: “Marula beer is part of our tradition. In olden days we used to drink it, sing traditional songs and dance all night long. It makes me proud to see tourists buying it too.”
