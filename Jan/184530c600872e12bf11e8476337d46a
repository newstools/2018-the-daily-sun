    FOR AS long as he could remember, all Makhado Sinthumule wanted was to be a pastor with a big church.  So after studying theology for four years, he travelled through West Africa to get muthi powers.  HOWEVER, HE ENDED UP MISUSING HIS POWERS TO PERFORM TRICKS SUCH AS MAKING PEOPLE VOMIT SNAKES! if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstPGSJXtI5A3tppo4sqsLkI1SbED5WwS87x3kPnUQNnGYpjxjtHKbcJ7kKGJkA8Kg42UonQE-aJIhoLIEQ_NbAPT_KDQ8YRiXnzvOeOhJpBadIFOnXMDmbPyJo8690MX7ehWU02kx_3phWAyzs_QWizZj_gOaKnLMC1X9lZvBM7Bcgq5lS5Ig9tpi_0yeWhHX5Mdh0e5IhN4BSPMOIF8qPeELdYD9llPOPi8QSIEjRwdzIalg6pUcFAl5OWiEAAik0Ik1EjwhzznfngJQ_BiJlLYIAyiTQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLvlMgb6Zzn0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I used the bad powers I got to make people do things such as vomit snakes,” he said.“I was in a rush to make money and see my church grow. This was what made me do bad things. The best way to get more followers was to perform miracles.”Although his powers brought him wealth and a fancy lifestyle, none of it made him happy.“I felt guilty day in and day out. I ended up getting people to pray for me and going for counselling,” he said.Makhado said he changed his ways and his evil deeds taught him about the importance of true testimony.“I confessed to the church. These days I am a new man and I can openly tell my followers what I did,” he said.“I told the congregants how I fooled them in the name of God, but behind closed doors I was up to evil.”He said he decided to travel around South Africa to discourage others from following his path. On Friday he spoke in Boipatong, the Vaal, after being invited by the Murendene programme, which deals with church-based evil- doers.He told residents: “Many people think stories like mine are just conspiracy theories, but the truth is that evil deeds do exist and many live with them every day just for wealth.“I was a good pastor when I started my church, but challenges arose and I started feeling I was wasting my time.“My mistake was to associate myself with pastors running big churches as they introduced me to these evil things.“Now that I am a changed man I preach the truth and nothing but the truth. I learnt that getting rich through muthi is bad.”
