THE father of a woman killed by five men said the family is not coping with the death.Thoko Mthethwa (31) was killed in cold blood when five men slit her throat and stabbed her sister Hlengiwe several times.Thoko was declared dead on the scene while Hlengiwe is fighting for her life at Tembisa Hospital.Their father Richard (63) from Ehlanzeni section in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, said: “I have never in my life seen such cruel people. How can someone kill a person by slitting her throat as if they are killing a chicken?“How cold-blooded are these people? I want them to remain in jail for the rest of their lives,” said a devastated Richard.He said his daughter had screamed for help as the men pinned her down.“There was blood everywhere in the house and the suspects were not ashamed to walk out with bloodstains on their shoes and clothes,” he said.He said Thoko was a quiet and respectful young woman who always wanted to help. I can’t believe she is gone,” he said.Her uncle Bongani (40) said they hoped the justice system won’t fail the family.“The killers must rot in prison and should never be seen in the community ever again. They deserve a death sentence.”Bongani applauded the police for their quick reaction in arresting the suspects, hours after committing the crime.Police investigations have revealed that the five were connected to the death of Thoko’s boyfriend in December.He was killed and dumped in the bushes and his bank card used to buy booze. One of the suspects is also linked to an incident in which a police officer was shot last year.Tembisa South police spokeswoman Captain Nelda Sekgobela said the five appeared briefly in the Tembisa Magistrates Court on Friday.They were kept in custody.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssVPkmcJRoow1o5t-4aee9KAm2TsgCnj9GhOHcw5MPvuNQ7LUNjpO46JztMVH_mrUwein29HFS4Wd9ERHO1q2JGc60kELpNH9kq3BjrmqRap8of9d7swM-1UCGEWZEFzYuSeox3TcTLWKd7Mj3Hlnm3gTOGd-QcuwuNXpjdG-o3cmKZJa4K9NNvPoSHdKIH6yG7cdUhX49BAHocfNQuf6LZE_zyMPWmYZoMJ7Fhr1nrjjbEJQpzWregQUGT7xNcrjKd3X1YwAcDv4QPaBzUTN_oFUnOlL0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAWZx6dOa7NJEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
