Nzama said hosting the conference and picnic was his way of giving back.“This is the least I can do for the artists. They support me and I want to support them. At the picnic, music fans will pay only R100.”On Thursday Nzama held a media launch and activation party at Desroches Hotel in Margate.Ray Nkonyeni municipal manager Max Mbili said the two events will help uplift the local economy.“We are grateful and happy our economy will be boosted,” he said. “We know Nzama as a businessman and did not expect him to do this for us and upcoming artists.” Budding DJ Lovemore from Gamalakhe said: “This is a chance I don’t want to miss.”
