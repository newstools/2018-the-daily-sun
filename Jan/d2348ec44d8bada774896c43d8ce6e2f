The people who don’t pay are the ones who should be targeted. “Look at the streets now. We really need water,” said the resident.The municipality had warned people about the water cuts. According to a statement issued last year, the large number of consumers who didn’t pay their bills. Yesterday Emfuleni spokesman Stanley Gaba said: “The municipality acknowledges the challenges. The intermittent water supply was caused mainly by the inability of the municipality to service its old debt plus paying the current account to Rand Water.” Gaba also said the municipality’s water account doubled from R41-million to R83-million.He said provision had been made to deliver water to the affected areas with tankers during the day. Hospitals and schools have been supplied with the JOJO tanks.
