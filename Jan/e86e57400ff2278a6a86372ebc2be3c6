The museum was eventually reopened after years of talks with residents. Community leader Nyebo Mbambisa told Daily Sun: “We received information from residents and we caught the thugs. We recovered the tables and chairs stolen at the museum. “It’s surprising that thugs target the museum even though there are security guards there.“This is the second incident in three months.“ In November, we also bust thugs with stolen property and handed them over to the police. But the thugs were later released. “We are going to hand these thugs over as well and hope they will be locked up for a long time.” Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge told the People’s Paper: “The police were called to the museum at 3pm after being told there was a break-in, but the security guards denied it. “There was a group of people near the museum and cops decided to leave because it was dangerous.”
