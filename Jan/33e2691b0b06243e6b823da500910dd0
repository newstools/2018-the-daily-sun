    FINANCE Minister Malusi Gigaba is feeling the pressure in
his search for money to fund President Jacob Zuma's free higher education plan
and has warned that drastic decisions must be expected in his February budget
speech."The concern about funding is genuine given the fact
that we have announced that there is a R51bn shortfall in the budget for this
financial year. We had indicated that any additional budget programme would
have to be funded in a way that does not breach the expenditure ceiling."Secondly, [we had indicated] that we would need to
implement certain measures, both in terms of expenditure cuts and revenue
enhancement, in order to take care of any additional budget pressure," he
said.However, he did not indicate where the cuts would be made.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv-AKMTmKELJtKLnqvdH2qWyd6gEcYX90URBJ4p7HqOrDpug3VO77Gp6CoUh-3RMQir1k-zde7f4sf7pkV-ULmh7p0Ll-lXuRlsKUmi-xqmvoR1qbQtLif4sn0goLRqPx2p7MXmsMUncN2L-gzA4tbbHTAV4bEgNWXeroUMcwYK3wLgigRyzgGXtqghl49O0PrEEWLjikzkNWQBWmG_KA-k9lto0FimGo8mw-7dYLL7DhY2MOBKcbrU4yo2qhhp6yqr0q54u_y1lb4u5aRntrimFr0UFm0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAU9sqddBiyFEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

the Eastern Cape Progressive Youth in Business breakfast as part of the party's
106th birthday celebrations in East London on Thursday.In December, Zuma made the surprise announcement for free
higher education for students from households with a total income of R350 000
or less.'The decision has been made'His decision came after the Heher Commission found that the
country could not afford free education.Opposition party EFF has been encouraging those who want to
study further to go to institutions of higher learning in their numbers to
demand to be registered despite some universities stating that they would not
allow walk-ins.Â Six people were injured following a stampede ahead of
registration at the Capricorn TVET College in Polokwane on Thursday morning.On the free education plan, Gigaba said: "It wasn't
going to be very easy to start implementing this in a seamless way right from
the outset. I think we needed to expect that there will be challenges and therefore
we need to deal with those challenges."He added that while this financial year would prove to be a
challenge for Treasury, the process would become more seamless over the next
two years than it was "at the present moment"."The decision has been made. What we are working on are
details to outline how the funding is going to be provided," Gigaba said.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/expect-drastic-decision-in-budget-speech-on-funding-free-education-gigaba-20180111
