fact that all 26 universities announced that they won’t allow walk-ins, the EFF
has repeated its call for students to walk in. In a
statement released by the party, the EFF also said that it will be at varsities
to make sure students are helped. “The EFF
reiterates its call that all academically deserving students must report to
colleges and universities if their choice this year during registration,” it

and reject the statement by Universities South Africa which announces that
there will not be walk-ins in universities. “They say
only students who applied last year will only be considered for university
entrance.” The party
slammed the announcement as a “direct participation and collaboration in Zuma's
grand-plan to mislead the public.” “It should
now be clear that Zuma announced free education on 16 December when
registration had closed. “Therefore,
universities should be working towards giving expression to the idea by making
provisions for all who did not apply because they did not have money to get a
chance to apply and be considered.” The EFF
said that all academically-deserving students must be given a chance to take
advantage of the free education declaration. “Management
in universities has always been able to amicably deal with walk-ins for as long
as universities have existed. “Why must
this provision not be made this year when the country needs it the most? It is
precisely that many did not have money that they did not apply; thus, since
there is a free education provision, let them be given a chance to apply and
their applications considered.” However,
Higher Education Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize has dismissed Malema’s statements as
reckless. “Mkhize
says Malema’s call is unrealistic. "There
is no way in which a person can walk in and expect to be registered. There is
no way to assume that because you have money you can just go to that particular
faculty. There is always a criteria people have to meet the needs," she
said in a recent interview. "We
are enhancing communication clarifying using all channels so that people
understand that announcement did not mean that we are changing what is a
standard practice in any institution of higher learning be at university or
TVET college," she said.
