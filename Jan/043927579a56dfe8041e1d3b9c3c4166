He was cornered by the cops and had to co-operate. The officers found he was carrying fake money to the amount of R77 800. “He was then arrested,” said Xuma. “We plead with business owners and the public to carefully check bank notes they receive, especially when doing transactions involving large amounts of cash,” he said.
