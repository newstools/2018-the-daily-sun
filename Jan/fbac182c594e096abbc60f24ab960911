He was my pillar of strength and always stood by me.“My father made a big contribution to my results. I just had to pass,” he said.“I also made school my second home and never skipped class.”Nkosinathi said he worked hard in memory of his mum.“I miss her and wanted to make her proud.” Nkosinathi’s proud dad, Gift Nkabinde (50), said he never dreamed his son would get so many distinctions, considering the challenges he faced after his mum died. “My son was also my pillar of strength when I was grieving,” said Gift.Unity Secondary School principal Wandile Makhubo saidNkosinathi has always been a bright pupil.“He used to stand in for teachers when they were not available. He taught some of his fellow pupils and was nothing short of a mentor.“Some of the pupils at the school owe their success to him. He went as far as organising afternoon classes for pupils who didn’t understand their work.”Nkosinathi obtained distinctions in English first additional language, Isizulu, physical science, life science, business studies, mathematics, life orientation and religious studies. He said he wanted to study either chemical engineering or actuarial science.
