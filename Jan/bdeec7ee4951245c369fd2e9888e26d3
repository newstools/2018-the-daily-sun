Ramaphosa said: “Bra Willie served the ANC with commitment and great passion during his years of exile. He wielded his pen with precision, choosing words that inspired, challenged and also provoked.” Mashile said: “Our poetry community has lost one of our greatest living libraries. “I often witnessed him introduce himself, while poet laureate, to young writers as a student of literature.” Struggle veteran Pallo Jordan described Bra Willie as a giant on the African literary scene. “He fought the good fight with uncommon courage and determination. He chose his side in the struggle against injustice at a very young age,” Jordan said. Legendary Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka sent a tribute, which read in part: “While the loss is keen, the memories remain fresh.” Bra Willie’s daughter Ipeleng Kgositsile thanked her father for everything he had taught her. “Papa was my best friend. Thank you for teaching us to respect adults but not fear them, for demanding that we keep our minds sharp and our hearts alive to love,” she said. Bra Willie was buried at Westpark Cemetery in Joburg.
