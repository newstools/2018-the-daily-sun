We are playing one of the big teams in the country, and in Africa. But I am happy with the way things are going at the club, and the mentality of the players is very positive. "We know that we have to fight for three points in all our matches, and the goal is to do the same against Downs. We have to beat teams like Sundowns if we want to grow our confidence levels and move away from the relegation zone.” At this stage the most important favour the players could do for the club bosses, Royal Bafokeng Development Trust, is to save it from being relegated.The 31-year-old N’gambi said the Hawks case and sale of the club must be left to office bearers, and not players.“Players are indeed concerned with all these stories, but at the end of the day, we have a job to do,” he said.
