The thug was bust stealing the members’ belongings in the temple and was chased by the MK veterans until he fell into a nearby river. He was given a hiding before being taken back to the temple. He was injured and was taken to KwaMashu Poly Clinic by ambulance. A member of the church said he saw the man hanging around bags at the temple. “He looked suspicious. We then saw him grab a bag and run. The MK soldiers saw him and chased after him,” she said. A Shembe evangelist said the man was sent by his ancestors to be cleansed of his evil acts. “We believe he was pushed by his ancestors to do this so he could be noticed and be cleansed,” he said.The ceremony was also attended by KZN Premier Willies Mchunu and Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala.
