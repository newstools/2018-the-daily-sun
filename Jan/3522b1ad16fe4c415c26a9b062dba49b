She was with a man. She doesn’t look traumatised.” After her baby disappeared she opened a missing person’s case at Protea Glen Police Station. “I couldn’t sleep. I left my nanny to look after my kids and trusted her, but look what she did.” The nanny said she was kidnapped and taken to Mogale City. “I was locked in a house with the baby but managed to escape. Luckily I wasn’t raped. I’m not familiar with this area as I’m from Lesotho.” Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng said cops would question the nanny and if she was found to be lying she would be arrested.
