They are also said to have had a hand in the operations of the country’s state-owned enterprises and the appointment of members of Zuma’s executive.On Tuesday, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo told journalists that he was ready to start working on the commission, but was waiting for the terms of reference from the president. Zondo was handpicked by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, as per Madonelsa’s remedial action, to head the commission.Zuma, who announced that the establishment of the commission on January 9, had been criticised for taking too long to release the terms of reference, with some claiming he was attempting to influence the debate at the ANC’s first National Executive Committee meeting, which was expected to discuss his removal from office.The justice department announced that Zuma had signed off on the terms of reference on Tuesday."The signed terms of reference are in the process of being translated into another official language, as per the legal requirement. The publication is scheduled for release on 25 January 2018," said spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga in a statement on Wednesday.The publication of these terms of reference would be followed by the release of the regulations which give the commission the legal competence to conduct the investigation, added Mhaga.He said these would include the chairperson having powers to subpoena witnesses and of search and seizure.Mhaga said the department would also assist the chairperson of the commission in setting up the required infrastructure and necessary resources to make sure the it fulfilled its mandate "efficiently and effectively".https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/state-capture-terms-of-reference-to-be-released-on-thursday-20180124
