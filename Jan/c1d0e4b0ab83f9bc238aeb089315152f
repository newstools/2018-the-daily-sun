This means that since the last press conference of December 5, 2017, a total of 170 extra cases emerged,” the minister said.“Of the 170, a total of 51 had already occurred before December 5, only we are discovering them now as the search continues, hence they were captured retroactively. “Therefore, there are 119 new cases that occurred since our last press conference,” He said. “Now out of the 727 laboratory-confirmed cases that we know about, we were only able to trace 134 actual patients.“One hundred and thirty four out of 727 is only 18%.This means that we still have a very long way to go in searching.“Out of the 134 traced patients, 61 had passed on.” “Our staff have been placed on alert to be on the lookout for patients presenting with corresponding symptoms, so that they can be detected early and samples taken for testing,” Provincial health department spokesperson Marika Champion said.Females account for 55% of cases where gender is reported.
