REJUVENATED AmaZulu players seek what would be their first consecutive Absa Premiership wins this season when they host Bloemfontein Celtic at the King Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi on Wednesday night (7.30pm). This is a catch-up game that got postponed in December last year due to a waterlogged pitch after the two teams had been on the field for not even 10 minutes.Usuthu go into this match with their tails up after beating SuperSport United 2-0 in their last game at the same venue on Saturday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuqv9xvrzOk4nO3sWUc6sUbg3KphCPUdzSV8rfmpuPM2Euf0CvdoOZRNQ3w63EVwmdJpxc1hHGA3w5xmwu1udmhI0fZDjtlJPRKMWEIFmk2ZCmFMGkLzcC-3WfQ-SH8Si0b0em7k8zFbq0dNOUAy8OEsLTAilIT0nA6j7QiOLYhSOokTL3gaelct6h81MNW3tTXJhPzFkehBOG-phP8VUr1NOW4n1Bs_eOnsjpAekp7uxIOJ3CJfWLWTJj8ie3C0Y0IB-g62QMhyuFW62IPL1MbhQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOLpVY9kCMlbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

And this was following a 4-0 drubbing at the hands of Maritzburg United a fortnight ago. AmaZulu are convinced they can take advantage of Celtic’s low spirits – but also mindful the opposition could use this match as a springboard. AmaZulu goalkeeper Siyabonga Mbatha, who was a hero during Usuthu’s victory over SuperSport, even saving a penalty kick, said they could not afford to lose to Celtic. He said Usuthu’s two games in hand would count for nothing if they could not bag six points.Said Mbatha: “We need to claim three points against Celtic, there is no other way. We need the points, just like we needed the ones that we got against SuperSport. “These points are huge, it means a lot to us. A win against Celtic would be massive.”Mbatha said Celtic’s recent slump in form did not mean they were a bad team, just that they were unlucky. They still deserve respect.He added: “We also lost consecutive matches before beating SuperSport. That didn’t mean we were a bad team. We were playing good football but we were unlucky, losing in the end. “Celtic are a good team, take nothing away from them. We need to go into this match with our eyes wide open. We can’t afford to get carried away. “They deserve respect from us, just like any other team we have played before.”This will be Mbatha’s sixth straight start this season, on the back of another clean sheet. He was named Man of the Match against SuperSport and says he is looking to pull off the same performance tonight.
