THE trending rumour that Platinum Stars have been sold to a consortium comprising businessmen from Cape Town, which could include head coach Roger de Sa according to some reports, seems to have left a bitter taste in the mouths of Dikwena players.Players put on brave faces on Saturday when they lost 2-0 to Orlando Pirates at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium after goals by Justin Shonga and Thembinkosi Lorch. But their angry and heartbroken captain, Vuyo Mere, came out guns blazing after their Absa Premiership clash, blaming the players for their slump, not the rumoured sale of the club. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvHMxkcJ1tghr1hMlNIbhhqd6wNN2ORwZCFlyD9O0SQ9ViB_mKdvdkBV5PntI6IjYqumwsf4DHVqBgOxA-ZHaWYfvJ9llWOaoUMPMUNxZDPv3Wrx3cglCz2KLly958tmRqHZb1erY6a9C0S__R7MgFnEcRdFGcSc-2GCPsNsubuwrzycElnsI-Bn8qxBimC0bmOqEHctXLOz1Tl6loghAMM5xriwHiWpP5qXTMXWSXd1A2bjinseB0OTieGnh-ekIOHnu4XY2BufCo6YnbARv-3zA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGD56SnpMlMlEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It would be very stupid of us to say that this is an excuse for us not putting in enough effort. “We are getting paid on time and players still have houses. Nothing has changed at all. We have the best training facilities in the country and the best coach. “The sale of the club is none of our business as players. We just have to do our job on the field.”There is a rumour that club chairman Cliff Ramoroa had a meeting with the preferred buyers of the club and went back to report to the players that nothing concrete had been signed.SunSport’s understanding is that the terms and conditions of the agreement have been signed by the club and preferred buyers, but they are waiting for the Premier Soccer League’s approval. It is further understood the asking prize has dropped dramatically, considering their current position in the standings – 16th with 15 points from 19 matches, two points behind 15th placed Ajax Cape Town.Stars are regarded as a club ready to conduct business with teams in the National First Division, where such clubs could fetch anything from R8 million to R10 million.Local businessman Thabo Mokgatlhe is believed to have put up an offer of R35m but got ignored following his outbursts that have seen top club officials come under investigation by the specialised crime unit, the Hawks.Such talk could certainly put players in panic mode, but Mere says they must focus on the job and let the management take care of the rest.Said Mere: “Players need to sort out their lives. Honestly, it is like some players don’t care about the supporters’ feelings any more. Our fans would use their last cents to come support us. And still we don’t put in enough effort.“That is the problem, we are not putting in enough effort. Some players walk around looking proud after we had lost matches – like nothing has happened. It makes you wonder. “It’s painful, it hurts those of us who have been with this club for years and know what this club is capable of. “The coach makes us train twice a day but at the end it’s up to us as the players to pull up our socks.”Asked if he had addressed such issues with his teammates Mere, who has been with Stars for eight years, said: “Every day, my friend. These guys are not kids any more. It’s about time players take a good look at themselves in the mirror.”Mere added that matches against Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns were lost even before they had stepped on the field, just because they are considered big brands. “And they would say, it is fine.“It’s completely wrong,” he charged. “If not these very big teams, then who do we plan on beating?” In the 19 league matches played so far, Dikwena have won only three, drawn six and lost 10. Up next for the Rustenburg side is a clash with tricky Chippa United at Port Elizabeth’s Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm).“We are now desperate for points,” said Mere. “Each and every game is like a cup final.”
