week, as students started climbing over the gates to get into the university
grounds to register.Hundreds of students gathered at the campus on Monday last week,
but the university kept the gates closed, only allowing entry to 20 students at
a time in order to prevent a stampede.Students became restless and started jumping over the gates and
proceeded to run into the university grounds as security looked on.Some students also attempted to break locks to one of the gates in
an attempt to gain access.
