They
were identified as the eggs of the extremely poisonous brown snake.The volunteers removed 12 eggs, but that afternoon more
eggs were discovered.The whole sandpit was cordoned off. By the time the
volunteers had finished digging three days later, they had discovered seven
different nests and removed 43 eggs.Everyone was very relieved the incident hadnâ€™t ended in
tragedy."Even when they are newly-hatched, brown snakes can
still be very dangerous to humans," Yvette Attleir, a Fawna Wildlife
Rescue volunteer, was quoted as saying."The venom is not quite as potent as it would be in
an adult snake, but if a child was bitten then they would have to go straight
to hospital."
