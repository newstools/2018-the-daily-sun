RETIRED Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt had a training session with Absa Premiership current log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns.The eight-time Olympic gold medalist Bolt is in South Africa as part of Athletics South Africa's (ASA) plan to bring greater awareness to the sport.Despite being the fastest man to grace the 100m and 200m distances, Bolt has always had a close affinity with soccer, often teasing the media that he will play the game professionally after his athletics career.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuPK9HcAqP89-DrT78eBZjrjxs-6NtF_kgl_0F9zL2GqDAobQEwaVSsfb9YnwMV07fpjuHgEyzXtokRm05Hp3Ia_iXuJR5iQfO1SXzFV6VmOYG5JWeyYYKTtpTBvdF3VfKlryiXRTMxW_DYsoH1koOHeyysCCfnpiR1NWWSu7jjubL31z-77zEImOVTuxGWYJNdNnTwdw6Kpl_yyWwS20uFZZ6raWiexLMA0hew7A9WYQEiyScdrqCsBXfchRgXFqdQdOT4mmR-UTAs0Mk78CtghA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzL49vkU31Km_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
