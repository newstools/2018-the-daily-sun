The current media activity appears to indicate that positive action is happening within certain elements of the prosecuting mechanisms within of the state,” OUTA COO Ben Theron said.“It certainly sent a strong signal of a new guard and a change of attitude when it comes to tackling corruption, now that Jacob Zuma is no longer at the helm of the ruling party,” Theron added.According to Theron, for now, the initial activity by the AFU appears to target a few corporate entities linked to the Eskom McKinsey and Trillian contract."However, in the near future, we sincerely believe that other cases and charges that include Gupta brothers, along with a host of senior government officials and other companies will begin to unfold," Theron said.
