We were even asked to go do newspaper interviews to protect Omotoso," Anele and Neliswa said in a statement.The twins say they lived in his Umhlanga house for a year, and it was the worst experience for them."We were actually pushed to please the man, we were told that God will punish us if we ever said anything against Omotoso. We lived a life full of threats and fear."According to the twins, elders in the Jesus Dominion International Church played a big role in making them run away from home to stay in Omotoso’s house."As kids we were made to believe that Omotoso, is the closest person to God and we can never have a relationship with God but only through Omotoso," the twins added.The twins say they were blind and their spirits were controlled by Omotoso."We could see all the wrongs, but we were never bold to speak out, we wanted to scream but had no voices."Anele and Neliswa said, they we were not allowed to study, but Omotoso's kids were furthering their studies.The rape allegations were not new to us when Omotoso was arrested."It is something that we knew long before he got arrested.The girls would talk immediately after it happened in the house and when one was called to the upper room we knew what was going to happen to them, we were made to keep quiet and never say anything," they said.
