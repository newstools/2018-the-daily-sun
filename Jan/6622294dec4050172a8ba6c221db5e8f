    PLATINUM Stars’ efforts to survive relegation have received a huge boost with the return of star midfielder Abia Nale.The forgotten former Kaizer Chiefs, Mpumalanga Black Aces and Maritzburg United player missed most of the first round of Absa Premiership action due to a serious groin injury. The last time the 31-year-old featured for the Rustenburg side in an Absa Premiership match was in September last year in Dikwena’s 0-0 draw with Chippa United at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssi_KSQ_Jc0RP_S_ZdnLmDLDI06DzxFS9RtZqrpZJpV6d3oSYVkET1UFcpgejrWPLOdReDe64vJ9qkQ83gUNt-Pn5F_Zg3h5hKgNRTUPy1WYsrjv6l_5xl46yVQ_YjrA3QyUif9JOK9nEFN0mnRUi2J_4XA0BN1Vfpr_D8TI15NuAQLT-gU6q8oLpl8vC6puJqAM3wIsIfX4-H582stJCvymiy_XWuHtlz21tm-YpCC8gq9vxQkyvwg7LFG2pIRiyr19R4HKkqX2ZL-cfgmhGlphg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHr2Fq5Ama43EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I am sure that if he continues to work hard he will return to the first team soon.”Added De Sa: “The only problem he will have is that other players have been doing well during his absence and he will have to work hard and regain his form fast to stand a chance of playing.”The coach revealed that he is likely to release some players before close of this transfer window.“You know, in football when some players come in, some have to go,” he said. “So far we have not yet received any inquiries about any of our players. “But there is still a lot of time before the transfer deadline.”Dikwena have signed midfielder Manti Mekoa and striker Letsie Koapeng so far.Stars are currently third from bottom in the standings with 15 points from 16 league matches.They face second from bottom Ajax Cape Town in their next league match at Cape Town Stadium on Friday  (8pm). The Urban Warriors are breathing down their necks and are only two points behind Stars.
