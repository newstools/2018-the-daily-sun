The people get to raise their concerns.NFCF spokesman Thabo Masombuka said the forum’s goal was to help get former Bafana Bafana captain Lucas “Rhoo” Radebe elected as president.Masombuka said they would contest a statement last week by the Football Transformation Forum (FTF) who backs Jordaan, that Radebe and former Safa vice-president, Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana were not eligible to stand. The Chief had announced earlier this month that he plans to oppose Jordaan.The FTF said Radebe couldn’t stand as he was not part of Safa structures, while Nonkonyana was fired by Safa.But Masombuka stressed: “We will table a motion before the congress to get Radebe, who is our preferred candidate, onto the ballot.”However, should that fail they would back another candidate: “SA football needs new leadership. The winds of change are blowing throughout the country and we have consulted widely. ‘We have spoken to Lucas and he will stand if eligible. We badly need new blood to restore the country’s football pride and take us back to the glory days of 1996 and 1998 when we won the Africa Cup of Nations and qualified for the World Cup in France. “Our football has been on a steady downward slide since those days and we as concerned people want change – not just from the top but from the bottom up.”Masombuka said former Fifa presidential candidate and ex-premier of Gauteng, Tokyo Sexwale, had also been engaged by the NFCF with a view to assisting the new forum.Former Bafana head coach Ephraim “Shakes” Mashaba represents the coaches while Ace Ncobo represents the referees on the forum.Like this story?
