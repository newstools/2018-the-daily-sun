THE notorious ANC secretary general and Free State Premier Ace Magashule is implicated in a property deal.According to News24, Magashule's long-lost daughter scored R9 million for doing nothing at the Free State Development Corporation (FDC).A News24 investigation shows that 27-year-old Thoko Alice Malembe, Magashule's estranged daughter with whom he was reunited in 2011, scored a controversial property deal with the FDC, a government entity whose chairperson is said to be a long-time ally of Magashule.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst70x-KLRJEb6-zZ2vqCSCEcOdYZtRUogzJXzpV-8HT-GtBG5J_VDI26_f_ya-jA9FhZn1DVtq-mtfxUZJ6mquXmWOm9IPFpe4k0ySbqFNkEDWvksPBblRKzNpXWlBYLu-b0XZBkoeJ99wcHJEhoscgZUnHHglgV1o9Wvcj3RDR9aTgACOaiKR62Ks-VmGIRyIHxXlam8i7Gbmx0Yp_-cayAnK1RgTq76rvDTcGVE2-MfcQa8-SVZ2qyYVB_cOsqUbYcsDkLlB_zswvdXhZ8IuF62wMB6k\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAqr3WHNU_CgEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
