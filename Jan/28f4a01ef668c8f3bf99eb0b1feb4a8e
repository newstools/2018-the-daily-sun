THE notorious ANC secretary general and Free State Premier Ace Magashule is implicated in a property deal.According to News24, Magashule's long-lost daughter scored R9 million for doing nothing at the Free State Development Corporation (FDC).A News24 investigation shows that 27-year-old Thoko Alice Malembe, Magashule's estranged daughter with whom he was reunited in 2011, scored a controversial property deal with the FDC, a government entity whose chairperson is said to be a long-time ally of Magashule.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuWhwO_7Vw5_1iJV4VrxZnzkY1sy7mt03ywdd67B5CLR4rJnsR02M-gFn9L4-wNvwtFFESdXqURDZgn7cJ6IYopoa0j1cKuLGN1sFBCEqyHiEHomLZIfbUm3T0kdaLSVxmVHjhGz61f3w5xUw5XmzOBw4GS2QPVVApvarO9barzAzCooR6D_0524T8wQZCojm1GAjvSsQ1J6LYClBy9P-ZN8tTCycaQxPeTrTl_etyFC670ZNJYYjHgERvx3Nq3xzg4Ou2IDMljFg1zNKWTZpx27vRZ8w4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOC8Ih68gW1bEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
