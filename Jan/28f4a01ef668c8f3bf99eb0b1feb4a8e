THE notorious ANC secretary general and Free State Premier Ace Magashule is implicated in a property deal.According to News24, Magashule's long-lost daughter scored R9 million for doing nothing at the Free State Development Corporation (FDC).A News24 investigation shows that 27-year-old Thoko Alice Malembe, Magashule's estranged daughter with whom he was reunited in 2011, scored a controversial property deal with the FDC, a government entity whose chairperson is said to be a long-time ally of Magashule.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssbBStvg5_U9-1DTBsQlezzwsizxkqIqLXs4xxp9L-G5OzV7GOnnh5IBSmhGiBRQVmlf53U4UzmSxd4FBJc4X9gpgvKpxWxpQUQEKBry7bpSowgwVZnKbynYWTq3qekcR1BdhP5-YqYTwQhmsIUCNBHB1ltsr28sEpnmxMxvbJKNanaRcrS4Az_Ys-AkAD1WlK_PuJ2Fq1KnajDh9x_ZMPPnpvAf7ZFAVJXF7Q3coF6hx86GH5sGUkpeLhU4AUuVDonrWjhjVMc-2IoOyKx8mRojmtm5N8\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YQAZILAIaqq-5hsA9ovCe-EYyHM9DB6ZrgF4YUSZ8pBOTPxXkcptS469RrLf0YURmf1DqUb9IUUcIK1VSWu8AjZ6E8INQsu2_hSYcar\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCWAdX2XKt-NEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
