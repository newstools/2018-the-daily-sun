THE notorious ANC secretary general and Free State Premier Ace Magashule is implicated in a property deal.According to News24, Magashule's long-lost daughter scored R9 million for doing nothing at the Free State Development Corporation (FDC).A News24 investigation shows that 27-year-old Thoko Alice Malembe, Magashule's estranged daughter with whom he was reunited in 2011, scored a controversial property deal with the FDC, a government entity whose chairperson is said to be a long-time ally of Magashule.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsup0AdTo5EOBkJ9sDbzbAfAqpcVCXE0j0o27ESQFBbIW9n-goFwwQQTb3wDC9wsfBdKLORYYeX5Dm8Z_k2lQFhsMjKg5mf-B-81V7GyySUPXNc-UW8xmrGOhOeIrpAEMdTwDhOHCFE9RQG5GhooA-qAJLG6CzlwHe0rPQewVwdADpFKE-WAj0nfLwJnRNMbpdErN-3YW_ZvOkSiPryQil3TqjBVz4_5jQ23ZLAglnjlcgUQyb3HATcnoHSCaLDTWZjQkRNi4blLA59xYe07iDXgT7WQCSI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLH90TCAFtx8EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
