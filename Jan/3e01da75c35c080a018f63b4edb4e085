It was trading down 3% by late Tuesday afternoon.“We have been informed of the allegations which Viceroy has made against Capitec Bank,” Capitec CEO Gerrie Fourie said.“We are committed to providing clear and transparent information that will show that these claims are baseless,” he said.The Reserve Bank on Tuesday, said Capitec was solvent, well capitalised and has adequate liquidity.
