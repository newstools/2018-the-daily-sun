attempting to strip me of my powers and duties before the disciplinary process
has been concluded.“All that I was asking for all
this time was a fair chance to clear my name from the aspersions which were
cast on my character,” she tweeted.De Lille also said that she will
defend herself against these allegations.“I will defend my case issue by
issue as I have done with the corruption allegations about renovations at my
home which I have shown were untrue,” she said on Twitter.“The Caucus of the City of Cape
Town will be asked to review the delegations in the City, to restore the proper
decision-making authority and functioning of the Mayoral committee, Council
committees and sub-councils,” the DA said in a statement.“That the organizational
restructuring is reviewed is looked at so that changes so required to ensure
governance that makes progress possible for all residents,” it added
