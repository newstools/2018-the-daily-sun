Now I don’t understand why this is happening,” said Zodwa.“Home Affairs must resolve this matter so my child can get her ID and move on with her life, now that she has finished her matric.” Cyril Mncwabe, a spokesman for Home Affairs, said: “Maybe the mum is not telling the truth about registering her daughter when she was born. But I will have to investigate the matter and see what happened during the birth certificate application.”
