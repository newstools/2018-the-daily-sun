These injuries could have been avoided,” he said.Yolanda is believed to have sustained injuries to her palm, index finger and ring finger.Buselaphi injured her thumb and index finger. Dhlomo said it was not yet clear if there were other similar incidents in other parts of the province.Speaking from her hospital bed, Buselaphi from Sweetwaters said the start of her new year was ruined. She said she found it hard to accept that she would lose her finger. “I can’t believe that a part of my thumb will be amputated.“I was outdoors and used fireworks to celebrate the new year like everyone else. “But the problem started when it exploded in my hand before I threw it away. “I had to be rushed to hospital, while other people enjoyed themselves,” she said.
