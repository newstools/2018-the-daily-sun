This was after a teen reported her boyfriend to the cops for stealing body parts.Grace’s mum, Tshifhiwa Muridili (40), said they didn’t ask for her daughter’s body to be exhumed and saidshe was very upset when cops told her. “My daughter’s name was on a list of people who could have lost body parts and people started accusing us of selling them. “It left my family heartbroken.“When they said they’d dig up her grave, I cried but we hope the accusations will stop.” Grace’s aunt, Virginia Ntwana (40), said now they will know whether body parts were stolen.“People were pointing fingers. It wasn’t easy for us.”Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the results will be released as soon as the body is examined.
