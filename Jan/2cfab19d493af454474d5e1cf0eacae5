Last month we closed another one by a Zambian prophet in his 20s. He was making a lot of money and drove the latest Range Rover. These fake prophets have made our people poorer.”@RealSugar_Foot tweeted: “Bushiri’s church is closed? Thank you, Jesus!”However, not everyone was pleased.Tiro Sedimo said on Facebook: “Jesus Christ was persecuted, so why not Bushiri? Whether he’s a true man of God is not my problem. I’m not the judge.”Julia Baikananyi wrote: “If this is true, then that would be the greatest mistake they ever made. They will regret it.”The Enlightened Church Gathering was not available for comment.
