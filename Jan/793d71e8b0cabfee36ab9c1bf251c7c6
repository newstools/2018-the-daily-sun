FORMER SA Football Association (Safa) vice president, Mwelo Chief Nonkonyana, has been discouraged from standing in the Safa presidential election in a bid to unseat Danny Jordaan, since he is “ineligible”.Nonkonyana has been on the  campaign trail lately as he plans to oust Jordaan, and claims to have the backing of the right people to topple the former mayor at the association’s elective congress on 24 March. However, the resuscitated Football Transformation Forum (FTF), big backers of Jordaan, told the media yesterday that Nonkonyana “is wasting his time”.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuJ7AfZHn4YE9czQVgcscKKxA7zoaa1m1H1aqvr38xmZv_hVIL-uuHO0M2JQZpJMeeW2MDg6JbXW7fK5uEgRqz-KW0UHf7DGB9Rw7U7qMLRb2r7PmpKr42rNMBmx0SElM1zyH3MPE6YhqAbtSOc6X784UhOy3F940uQ5b4Z_9KagFVhO4xpyFHPekSilR-Ax5fGjgKJgpDeznnApb0cTh6xF2CCJLGSLJy_wYKDT3RwRMkkJgwZ6JR1jyGv6T_zBhzENwkcZYxvlYQ__Bmp\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEV1grW9ynAcEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Now the Chief, as an expelled member, surely cannot stand for election. “He is ineligible on that basis alone. He won’t be there (on 24 March) and he shouldn’t be campaigning. His campaign is just a joke. If there is an eligible person, we would welcome the candidate.”FTF secretary-general  Mz-wandile Maforvane revealed that 31 out of 52 Safa regions have already endorsed Jordaan as president.“The election process is over for Safa, as regions have declared who the leader will be. They have endorsed Jordaan as president,” he said. “We have 31 (regions) backing Jordaan and are working on two regions to ensure we have the  full quota. “The move by the Chief to go to court (challenging his dismissal) is to create chaos. He was expelled in 2014 and lost. He still owes the association a lot of money.” Maforvane is disappointed that Nonkonyana has judged Safa’s performance on Bafana Bafana’s failure to qualify for the 2014 and 2018 World Cup.“We are building towards 2022 (Qatar World Cup). When you look at the performance of our junior teams we have youngsters like Sipho Mbule, Tebogo Mokoena, Wiseman  Meyiwa, Kobamelo Kodisang, Keletso Makgalwa and Percy Tau who are doing well, which shows the current Safa structures are building for the future.”
