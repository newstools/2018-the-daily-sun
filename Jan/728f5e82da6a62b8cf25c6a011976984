AN EXPLOSION at a power station has left residents in the dark for four days.The Tosa substation, just behind ArcelorMittal in Vanderbijlpark, in the Vaal, exploded on Sunday morning, leaving Vereeniging, Three Rivers, Duncanville and some parts of Arcon Park without electricity.Emfuleni municipal spokesperson Stanley Gaba told Daily Sun a technical team was on site to establish the nature and extent of the damage.He said they had found that a transformer overloaded and the explosion came from inside the Mittal factory.“They had to switch off everything at Mittal to fix things in their factory, including their substation, which also blew up. The explosion is believed to have been caused by circuit breakers that tripped,” he said.According to Gaba, technicians also reported an incident of attempted cable theft in the Unitas Park area.“There is an open field behind Unitaspark extension 3 that houses an underground cable distributing electricity from a mini substation in the same area,” he said.“Criminals have been targeting the cable and causing outages. This illegal tampering has created a fault.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvkPUoNp0CHrW3C7ZXCTF8VG7xb7H4RofnOMnZLn8DVmlJiRz0srD1zEVzL0JZkQznn6q4BUKqDSyJZmiZ8FSV0-HJccQ4uXVMW__NZHzrlrU3oqiORZ6nPNDFOsad0-FARgo3k4rYQs4lAPpT0Zmn-CaKkswrzckaN8w_ArlY71i7dPSw5IElMjvAdI96VJM_TezOzQg30ucU3po3PGHgJjeJrmqLyJQnDlWC1Py63KlzMpWdAGS7Q7_KmD_MBpQQgNY2cbulUSz-wWaxPR0_dvMr-QYM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGsL0m5uMKWVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
