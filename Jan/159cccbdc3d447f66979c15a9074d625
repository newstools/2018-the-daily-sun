VIRAT Kohli was in full flight at Centurion on Monday morning, cruising to his 21st Test century on Day 3 of the second Test against the Proteas. This innings, the first century of the series, has been a masterclass from the Indian skipper that has given his side a chance of winning the Test and staying alive in the series. Kohli has been sublime, with his shot-making providing an exhibition for the small crowd in attendance. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv9rTW7cX_sZvt2ZmLeaUs9T-iMFdZvcHEdAIDiJSZ1N2hsRZopOEVjOj_emybo3bsBjcVgHDdeDAOHG9SMg3AXetK9NuZkxvxFfCPSNotCkEq2kQY3M4vHRFrgdGfcsnFVKyaHZHQHLIC6fgwS3yejQ5xUnTSmt38RpiNirX1kcZ_qepV25Fpjwe2dMSTRvhvJ4HY2j8P-90MiiBQcIx4sgOkbc_pGq_r9jYnxqLpj6yABtVrK2r7Kq2pzgsUMbe6ZY4nQB7Ip95AQjSLj\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMugcK0DCkDMEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
