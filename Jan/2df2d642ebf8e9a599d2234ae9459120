Themba Zwane, Tiyani Mabunda and Percy Tau almost in disbelief as the shot-stopper came up with the goods for the visitors.Having weathered-the-storm, Pirates doubled their lead in the 18th minute. Makola with a rasping finish following a defensive blunder from Motjeka Madisha who coughed up possession in a dangerous position.Memela squandered a golden chance to increase the Buccaneers lead moments after the half-hour mark. Mabokgwane with the quick release to send the attacker on his bike, but with only Denis Onyango to beat - he could only succeed in guiding his attempt over the crossbar.The Brazilians finally found the back of the net with 38 minutes on the clock. Themba Zwane with the defence-splitting pass to tee up Percy Tau who made no mistake; firing an unstoppable left-footed shot into the roof of the net.Pirates, though, were not done as Memela rattled the woodwork after Onyango misjudged a ball into the area. The visitors deservedly in front as the two teams headed for the tunnel at the break.The action continued following the interval and with Sundowns turning the screw, it was no surprise to see Anthony Laffor make his way onto the pitch on the hour mark, and he should've pulled the hosts level with 66 minutes on the clock.The Liberia international skying his attempt with the goal at his mercy - to the frustration of Pitso Mosimane who ran down the touchline in dissatisfaction.Sundowns continued to dominate possession and territory, but were ultimately punished for their failure to convert a succession of chances as Memela put the game to bed.The Pirates attacker, who bagged a brace in their victory over Baroka FC last weekend, sending an unstoppable shot past Onyango in the 83rd minute to put the game to bed.
