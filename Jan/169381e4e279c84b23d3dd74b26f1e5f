How would we justify that, given what has happened."The former Health MEC, Qedani Mahlangu in her testimony last week also indicated she wasn't offered any package following her resignation in February last year.On Tuesday Makhura told the arbitration that resigning shouldn’t be perceived as enough accountability.He was responding to the question put to her at the hearing, whether is it sufficient enough that Mahlangu has resigned.He said: “Our system of governance will work better if everyone is held to account and responsibly, even if you’re not directly involved.”"Resigning should not lead people to think that when you resign is enough. There mustn’t be anybody who thinks we can’t go beyond that, but will leave it to these proceedings to decide,” added Makhura.Makhura said it didn’t take a lot of persuasion to fire Mahlangu after the interim report of the Health Ombudsman was released.Instead, Mahlangu said she will resign if he wanted her to. But she made it clear that she disagrees with the findings of the health ombudsman report.
