To mean, they were thousands others who could not make it to the event because of capacity issues.The Prophet clarified about stories going round about using FNB ticket money to enrich himself. He said that the entire event has a R11 million budget.The R10 tickets, he said, was too minimal that the money realised was only used to produce the tickets which were principally for control purposes.He underlined that much of the money used for the event came from his personal accounts.Prophet Bushiri is also said to own investment companies with various entities such as hotels, airlines, consultancy agencies, mobile networks, mining, to name but a few.
