It was difficult to open windows and doors because of the bad smell,” said Phumlisa at the time.She said nurses at the clinic told her the cause of her TB and that of her 10-year-old son could be linked to inhaling sewage. “That drain nearly killed us,” she said.“After Daily Sun intervened, our problem was resolved. Today we can open windows and doors and cook in a clean environment. Hopefully, we will be able to recover now that we can breathe fresh air.”Mthubanzi Mniki, a spokesman for Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, said: “We are glad to have a paper like Daily Sun working with us and bringing the problems of the community to our attention. “Our commitment is to make sure there is dignity for our people.”
