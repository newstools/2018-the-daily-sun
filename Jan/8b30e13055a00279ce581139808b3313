Day Zero in Cape Town has been brought forward by nine days to April 12 due to a drop in dam levels, City of Cape Town Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson said on Tuesday."Unfortunately, due to a drop in the dam levels of 1.4%, Day Zero has, as of today, moved forward to 12 April 2018," said Neilson."To those of you who are not yet part of the massive water-saving efforts that are underway in Cape Town, we urge you to join friends, neighbours, colleagues and team Cape Town as a whole in beating back Day Zero," he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvvuu0ns-1Hhioei6tr2SeGfskyVVwh5UNSDkbirsKH32xMMmLrAYtyI4t_e5xtDf6OIq-xb2oB5gDfxZGAZQjhW7z3LDG8U_g1CAks251gI_LAVUKpfq5xW9ojCZMspMckhJDVWgpjAgEqatcMkeXvxJ8d7Fyk6tOxjF7JB7FWVq_f_qaTw5kgYBmgBjD8Fp67jLB7iEaNnG2wNaPcUTH3Ahcvn5L3d2tj1gV-t_fHb6SKHvV8npWl_f_ci4UKPcIh6VFVA30pPwOBKllrOPEslHSAQc0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFIAL7JYyHo-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
