Day Zero in Cape Town has been brought forward by nine days to April 12 due to a drop in dam levels, City of Cape Town Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson said on Tuesday."Unfortunately, due to a drop in the dam levels of 1.4%, Day Zero has, as of today, moved forward to 12 April 2018," said Neilson."To those of you who are not yet part of the massive water-saving efforts that are underway in Cape Town, we urge you to join friends, neighbours, colleagues and team Cape Town as a whole in beating back Day Zero," he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv8yzMCsEy8ZslWdtNDXQ485EQ7LuOJ9lxuPu7ObgZP5JpG-bO_CCMZw2RTf7Exs19pn8WQWA-e2ifnQa8RNo0_8jg9k1iKyEFU9YJV5aXKHhsNjYzRpiOhltDVUTQqlwinuk8fzM98EzHFDLql29i5afTAc2DfXuyNfKJgl6ftFAaG0bnuSxVzXNRP4e1a4PWLKZ1BhFQfkvytftE3nt32o7SDrs0ttdVpxGbzulJVdccoct1e6XCjry0vocUlNXgSacPfwNTEdMSmHiS8kR7OyoDla0w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIVkR8KNvrtJEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
