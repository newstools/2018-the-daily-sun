Day Zero in Cape Town has been brought forward by nine days to April 12 due to a drop in dam levels, City of Cape Town Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson said on Tuesday."Unfortunately, due to a drop in the dam levels of 1.4%, Day Zero has, as of today, moved forward to 12 April 2018," said Neilson."To those of you who are not yet part of the massive water-saving efforts that are underway in Cape Town, we urge you to join friends, neighbours, colleagues and team Cape Town as a whole in beating back Day Zero," he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv5bQyypSSe9teGnCoz84iaLna423f2LBxcxFeTpa3Cv8G4WO4jhrYw66uUKmBwQIsP2xNR0vIFsQO1gmj3OJXLQOrYiwEcE_aEfnfRSg_Hnyq141FaZoNd9S1fVwwjtnz_yIjyf-_xs0c3q4tZ2Eeenom7mG3qwZVi9nkem4gxPOFHF9tw0Kcp6B54fYUmtb_k96_hH_nNLkWhfg4b9fuKAhJDI3fXFwJms87lNyYKAsHQ6nFc87DJXOfkULr0Uits8cAZLIp2z8JDNaQquKQDbtT-zNs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAsoA9gqMNJmEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
