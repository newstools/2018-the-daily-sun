Day Zero in Cape Town has been brought forward by nine days to April 12 due to a drop in dam levels, City of Cape Town Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson said on Tuesday."Unfortunately, due to a drop in the dam levels of 1.4%, Day Zero has, as of today, moved forward to 12 April 2018," said Neilson."To those of you who are not yet part of the massive water-saving efforts that are underway in Cape Town, we urge you to join friends, neighbours, colleagues and team Cape Town as a whole in beating back Day Zero," he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsunGIhHJuSIR78lJk58-FQnC1AV4z3Fm2yyemcmVOGnEMJXytuBQaAIN8s6ssprv2vW_ir2krqGWU-YklejH-FkQ949V7UxfvGPmuwh3L8Zzr_jluCuMztb9jL3RJ98FZCSgB8tckqkKn4rajQSfNs6DT0FfGB6dAmOa9EJuda1_7Not6p6GhXAg7luNhsx1yjlurV9p7u68xvuh2HytoKHsEM2ALnM6TdV9xzoskkLMgSetxq6m6xbA2fv7QmLD49YQyhYpZHlFk9_je2mtQp4PkbbfGA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEMg0AxxkudaEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
