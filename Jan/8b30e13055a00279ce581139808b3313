Day Zero in Cape Town has been brought forward by nine days to April 12 due to a drop in dam levels, City of Cape Town Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson said on Tuesday."Unfortunately, due to a drop in the dam levels of 1.4%, Day Zero has, as of today, moved forward to 12 April 2018," said Neilson."To those of you who are not yet part of the massive water-saving efforts that are underway in Cape Town, we urge you to join friends, neighbours, colleagues and team Cape Town as a whole in beating back Day Zero," he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssaF-utpveksoif8Qyq0A5XvRsfUA1opvxS9Qp6qtIRtszx5Q_2EU7J1s36LnRa6FgKMMn2lGeck5WMaJ6as1vK3jlPYa2_N7CS7Qcgt83N7Gm8a0d9iCslAqyFpbkmRoqWdn1X08ALn7Q9zEcntR4pSR2NoAseQBENVZeJHHOMOfxWHUwlkCX67_-YO2DJvrfJ7vS9cuTd7MCeUF5gq3pJMpaMJKlkcW_mQHro3m0ly53jotfqefeGjlfLQyJ5Knym-9_nvpFC6PY88zd8mLP2drKrpoM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEDXKbq2DTU9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
