Day Zero in Cape Town has been brought forward by nine days to April 12 due to a drop in dam levels, City of Cape Town Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson said on Tuesday."Unfortunately, due to a drop in the dam levels of 1.4%, Day Zero has, as of today, moved forward to 12 April 2018," said Neilson."To those of you who are not yet part of the massive water-saving efforts that are underway in Cape Town, we urge you to join friends, neighbours, colleagues and team Cape Town as a whole in beating back Day Zero," he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu_CKLhsv9AEgafHzaWsd8V5jJRlVfczmA2_DASdnUT77CNIJaLun4IlpRnCS_ViXfvnFTQVESSxZJMgGnFP-4k1LMEnaNO5VmG-U9J8KuLLJbaqPTHPDon5gya0_clgkns39ODm4cfNkL-6oVqeTj9Gra3ZykhmHsKDRNgfkPM1BD1Do60x1FoP_PHXkE2kG6Y9rKscvIU18mJvwjGEr1qVARMOM2ucwTDcVnRV1Q0RS5RWmYYsaePXrTXWtUJyCw1LPTAsOkW2LQaw5O9FagbprlR4Kg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIjyvOQNTfdEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
