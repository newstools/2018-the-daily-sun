Day Zero in Cape Town has been brought forward by nine days to April 12 due to a drop in dam levels, City of Cape Town Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson said on Tuesday."Unfortunately, due to a drop in the dam levels of 1.4%, Day Zero has, as of today, moved forward to 12 April 2018," said Neilson."To those of you who are not yet part of the massive water-saving efforts that are underway in Cape Town, we urge you to join friends, neighbours, colleagues and team Cape Town as a whole in beating back Day Zero," he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuTS4bbuboEArng-LRTQDAsIsGdvPFGVUDEMd6-gwuHhamVKVZVADQEm7dyBmpaAtRFsg1ZXh05e9SHkPHwE3yi0t_vPHQsi5jSiIwcR3JzbC5Cn4A7F7syqSNvqq-NqIAFPlxrDHYNlmjcr85GzRgLUbwwWrYCOps-nHQ2gASrcoqI8eb4DqXhF9W7TqsYi26WP0xz-Fz7ueUy8BEBBl2CjJ_qr-PLIDX-77lPSpVBuHT5V-HOyW92MtwWUSDk9QtTcvE61UYw4ssqAzOwHcI4VTly-Po\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJBxMNQSclkQEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
