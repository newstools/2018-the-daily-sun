Day Zero in Cape Town has been brought forward by nine days to April 12 due to a drop in dam levels, City of Cape Town Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson said on Tuesday."Unfortunately, due to a drop in the dam levels of 1.4%, Day Zero has, as of today, moved forward to 12 April 2018," said Neilson."To those of you who are not yet part of the massive water-saving efforts that are underway in Cape Town, we urge you to join friends, neighbours, colleagues and team Cape Town as a whole in beating back Day Zero," he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssoq1LPcv5Iu8IQpqyf_Fdsu2KrAsozWevdn79VKe0JtxXFx7ZqFqzAvHCpIooW-5V-zdJhdLnxz_r85CNOvZT0qFlqU8OleYKzIArmYyRxZEuXl4zIvvjEDNsYiOHSrOS32xZ7YoPCjif5P2FtIVqWkOBM1YkUoNu23IeIMBDok5X4C0Ja7uX2ARJDOh9c-OATA08PVii-0C9YqnircFlemXc4YfS71Bd28qr19LpCaZTIyTFd-tczimDVMAKnKAh_yeCb5pa8DNDHj45PW86x5P0s7jM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKDNWoiTCdpiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
