The thugs disappeared among the shacks next to road, but one was bust as he tried to run, and his friend was shot dead when he opened fire on approaching police.The road remained closed for several hours as cops collected evidence from the scene. Mathabo Sepalo (28) said she thought what they saw only happened in movies. “I’ve never seen such brave thugs in my life. It looked as if they were enjoying the shoot-out. “They were driving as if they owned the road,” said Mathabo. “The thugs are unknown in the area. Luckily, no one was hurt. Although they are thugs and they should be punished, they warned people to stay indoors. “This does not happen with most tsotsis.” Mamelodi West police spokesman, Captain Johannes Maheso, confirmed the shoot-out. He said four suspects stole a car in a robbery in Nebo, Limpopo. “The car was tracked and the police received a tip-off that it was heading towards Mamelodi. “When police spotted the car, they tried to pull it over, but the driver sped off,” said Maheso. “The suspects started shooting at the police and a shoot-out broke out. “Two suspects ran away on foot, one was arrested at the scene and the other was shot dead.” He said police were looking for the suspects who ran away.
