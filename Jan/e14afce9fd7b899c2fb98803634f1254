Now it's time to work!!! https://t.co/Bfnyglj0tt — Chris Maroleng (@ChrisMaroleng) January 30, 2018'Touch me on my studio'Maroleng was part of a now famous broadcast of a 2010 panel discussion on the relationship between farmworkers and their employers on the show Africa 360 on eNCA during which André Visagie, the former secretary general of the right-wing Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, lost his temper at political analyst Lebohang Pheko.Visagie ripped off his microphone and stormed off set only to return and continue shouting at Pheko.  Maroleng stood up and put his arm across Visagie, to keep him away from Pheko, and told Visagie: "Touch me, and you'll be in trouble."Maroleng repeated menacingly: "Touch me on my studio..." until an angry Visagie was led off set."Touch me on my studio" went on to launch memes, and was remixed into several songs.Former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng was fired by the broadcaster last June for bringing the SABC into disrepute and causing irreparable damage to his employer.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/new-sabc-coo-looking-forward-to-working-at-national-treasure-20180130
