The workers plan to march to Tshwane House and to the Union Buildings to demand reinstatement.They claim they were wrongfully dismissed after the city said their contracts had expired. One of the workers, Ellen Sunday, said mayor Solly Msimanga had replaced them with pensioners. “These people get grants every month,” said Ellen.“He never thought about the number of families that will starve.”The league’s regional chairman, Lesego Makhubela, accused the DA-led municipality of making empty promises. He said the party, before being elected, promised people jobs but fired thousands and replaced them with volunteers. Mayoral spokesman Samkelo Mgobozi said the intended march was unprotected and illegal. On Monday, protesters torched municipal offices in Mabopane as their march for jobs became violent.
