The family and community believe that Kenneth’s death could have been avoided. Youth leader Tshepiso Moleele said it was time for young people to take a stand.“Had the mine come to us and listened to us when we engaged them, we would not be here. It is time for young people to take up the fight led by Kenneth. He fought for what belongs to us and for our jobs,” said Tshepiso.Kenneth’s uncle, Rakgomo Mputle, said he was thankful to the community for their support. He said his nephew died a dignified man in his own land, not like a stranger in a place where he was not known.“I look at this situation and can’t help but think the attack was planned. What I understand about the law is there are warning shots and one does not shoot a person from behind,” he said.Local business forum chairman, Shoes Magodielo, said what happened was a declaration of war by the mine. He said this was a fight for everyone because Kenneth died for the entire community.Community members said they would visit their nearest police station to lay charges of murder and attempted murder.
