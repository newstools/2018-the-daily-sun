THE Department of Education in Limpopo has allegedly failed once again to deliver textbooks.According to the Democratic Alliance (DA) more than 222 schools across the province haven't been supplied with learning material in time for the new academic year.The DA says the department is now blaming the schools for not placing their orders in time towards the end of 2017 academic year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstdk-IlCCqIUIVMz-zoE1Aqv4Do6FU4mXdbNBQBYgb8ZAEyUqPTeqDOwNRmEIoyIRQqBNJwTf-CBn9n3TBp2wKA34GsiXsqy7VCCypRyeK2G2Sm7pLPWzl2GXn4zUswRGm9a7xT8LIYP2rBHxLmONivK27Kyzwa78rm2G81E71b6xdyRF0_0IXq4iMW6B0HK12hWlju_zOd56SOMGfmFrh1sUujCa4Dl4yk4yK7kx2UT8oEPhFO1uHBoIPP0EaPEMTHf2zT1rQmFv-ABrXm2xfh_bK04z8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOX4rtiAA571EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
