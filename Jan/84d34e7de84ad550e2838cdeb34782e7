    It
is now up to President Jacob Zuma to decide whether he wants a
"messy" exit.Or if he wants an exit that could see him consigned to the "dustbin of
history" without presidential benefits, or a "dignified exit"
where he steps down voluntarily.This
is the view of at least four members of the ANC's national executive committee
(NEC) ahead of the powerful body’s inaugural meeting in East London on
Wednesday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsshT1XjfpPWJnWE6e7nE2WcUK024PqLTV-P5Yo4pT5HmaWkxkVcCCq6zoxAQjz8DgO1iWNStuWMbZwSC988QrBsWy-49bVoM-opwGSnAMoG1LORDm3j8H1FfhVZJXvEx6GK9pT1cuoKyt0dj82coUDvOErpfUHlnmDllc33BWSA99gxibO8CbpXBSu6YdF_LyQIgbvUnjVBuzdN13o6gwUprmXExMmWCPbwqApHL4EgFZqbbO-1lhHc8eAjsFMt_T141Dks3RNlz2aoourfH9aIia_B3v8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOtQEe6FYeYAEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

the politicians, who spoke to News24, did not agree that Wednesday’s meeting
should be the place to recall Zuma should he refuse to step down.This
comes as some NEC members are pushing for the newly elected leadership to
recall Zuma and get the party on a "clean slate" ahead of the
all-important 2019 national elections. Zuma has shown no intention of stepping
down, with the presidency releasing a statement that he would meet with his
Kenyan counterpart, Uhuru Kenyatta, in Durban on Thursday - a day after the
scheduled NEC meeting.  The
NEC members, who spoke to News24 on condition of anonymity, all agreed that
Zuma was a "liability", but want the party to avoid a
"divisive" battle over his fate. A
close Ramaphosa ally told News24 that the best option was for Ramaphosa to meet
Zuma over the matter. He said it was expected that they would have had a
one-on-one meeting the past weekend in KwaZulu-Natal. It is unclear whether
this meeting took place."Ramaphosa
was supposed to tell Zuma that the odds are stacked against him. He could
choose a dignified exit or a messy one," the source said.Ramaphosa
was on a charm offensive in the province on Sunday and Monday, meeting with the
party’s rival groupings in the province, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and
paying homage to past ANC presidents from the province.The
visit was an attempt to soothe the wounds of the province’s embattled
leadership after none of its candidates made it to the party’s top six.The
sources all agreed that it was now a matter of when, and not if, Zuma steps
down. But the priority was not "alienating his KZN support base".Said
a source: "It would be better if Zuma stepped down so that they
(KwaZulu-Natal) don’t feel that their man was pushed out, but see that he had a
good exit as he decided on his own that he will step down."There is a fear
that an alienated KwaZulu-Natal could cost the already weakened party in the
national elections as it contributes the lion's share of votes."We
will get a report on the outcome of Ramaphosa’s engagements with Zuma and if
they were not successful, then the second internal process would be for the NEC
to remove him," the source said.One
source believed that, if the Ramaphosa/Zuma talks failed, it would not be
difficult for the NEC to oust him."People
who supported him (Zuma) are beginning to sing a different song to retain their
ministerial positions. They still want blue lights," he said.Zuma
ministers who made it to the NEC include Bongani Bongo (State Security), David
Mahlobo (Energy), Fikile Mbalula (Police) and Nomvula Mokonyane (Water and
Sanitation). The
Star reported on Monday that Mbalula told a mini-rally that Zuma's recall would
help to improve the image of the ANC. "The
ANC has not been criticised for implementing its own policies. It has been held
to ransom in relation to the presidential figure in terms of the issues that
arise around that particular individual. We have a new president now and going
forward, we are confident that we will build on where others have left
off," Mbalula was quoted as saying. ‘The
old man is a liability’Two
other NEC sources said it would be best to wait out Zuma's recall."We
understand that the old man is a liability to the congress. He is hurting us
but removing him when we are trying to champion the unity agenda will only take
us back," one source said. If
Zuma does not resign he is expected to face an "embarrassing" and
"messy" option of a Parliamentary recall or impeachment process. The
Constitutional Court ruled on December 29 that Parliament had failed in its
Constitutional duty to put mechanisms in place to hold the president
accountable. Parliament
has since called an urgent meeting of its subcommittee dealing with the review
of the National Assembly rules to finalise the drafting of the rules that deal
with the removal of a president from office. The committee is expected to meet
on Thursday and Friday.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/its-not-a-matter-of-if-but-when-zuma-goes-nec-sources-20180109
