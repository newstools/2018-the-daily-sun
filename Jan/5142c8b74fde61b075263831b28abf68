Khaya Xaba, the union’s spokesman, said the strike would spread to the University of Pretoria before the end of the week.Workers initially demanded a 12% pay hike but the university offered them a 6,5% increase. The workers have since lowered their demand to 9%. The union also demanded that the university must stop outsourcing its workers.Xaba said Nehawu believed Unisa could afford to pay the increase workers were demanding.“The university registers more than 400 000 students a year and has more than R400 billion in reserve. “Our view is that they are being dishonest when they plead poverty,” he said.Xaba said they were representing 85% of the workers at Unisa, from cleaners and gardeners to lecturers and management.Unisa spokesman Martin Ramotshela said the university and the union were still in negotiations.He said it was unfortunate the strike had to affect the students, but they were doing everything in their power to help them.
