    The lack of infrastructure to implement President Jacob Zuma's fee-free education plan should not be a barrier used to deny the poor access to higher education, EFF leader Julius Malema said on Monday.Speaking live on Limpopo's Energy FM breakfast show on Monday, Malema warned that denying the poor access to education would be a declaration that all universities' gates be locked. Malema said that universities' lack of capacity to accommodate thousands of aspiring students was "none of our business"."If you cannot take the poor into the university because of infrastructure... no one must go," said Malema.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstwAnbqxs68AUdgxQ9gjHW4qV0o8i2P1lw6-3P_vO29fpKnnnHryzTBJb7_SFoGzVqoTQFXVeKXI3I4c3GYE6wbgN8SsmSQJ2-b3cBuEr2luHPXzvtf9dGIM6hyKjmexe44aB9VYN14dxCcm0-gNk6EGqR6ioIpMmXbWrTJRq4H3v9-L_cyqNnzYNeBDi1CucGqJH69mJvox9q9cQmXSYR5IpvClez8aNlZIJsgKcvS2Klph8y3epyZBXrODEwHeIv8KSqsUzHO1UENFQQVqIkNUQLs8F8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPewYb8zri6_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

How do you announce free education while knowing that you don't have infrastructure? "Lack of infrastructure should never stop our people from registering at the universities," said Malema.He argued that Zuma's announcement was a good opportunity for a majority of impoverished families.Free education 'non-negotiable'Asked whether he foresaw any problems with filling universities beyond capacity, Malema said that eventuality would force government to act."It's a nice problem to have. Why do we avoid a nice problem? Let's have more students, then [it] will force government to build more infrastructure much quicker."He also insisted that free education was non-negotiable, as it was the ammunition needed to fight white monopoly capital. According to Malema, it was only through education that cheap labour and high dependency on grants would be eliminated.Thousands of aspiring students are currently queuing at institutions of higher learning, including in Limpopo's University of Venda and University of Limpopo.Malema said if the students were told to apply online instead, the EFF would deploy a mobile information and communication technology centre to help them enrol.However, some universities, including the University of Cape Town, the University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Johannesburg, have already announced that they will not be accepting any walk-in applications during the registration period, saying their application processes can be completed online.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/if-the-poor-cant-get-into-universities-then-no-one-must-get-in-says-malema-20180108
