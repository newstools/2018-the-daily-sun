I questioned her and was shocked to learn she was having sex.” The family laid a charge against the suspect. He was arrested and released on bail.“That didn’t stop him from seeing the girl,” said the aunt. “She’s moved in with him at his parents’ home. “She’s so young and I feel he has destroyed her future. “She doesn’t respect nor listen to us anymore.”She said the man has even stopped the girl from going to school. “I want him locked up for good because the first arrest didn’t teach him a lesson,” she said.The suspect’s mother told Daily Sun she didn’t approve of the relationship as the girl is a minor. “I tried to end the relationship because it brings shame to both families,” said the mother. “I tried chasing them away from my house but failed because both disrespect me. I’ve given up and also want the law to take its course.”Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that the family had laid a charge of statutory rape against the suspect. “We’re taking this matter seriously, and it has now been referred to the family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit for investigation,” Ngoepe told Daily Sun.The suspect will appear again in the Seshego Magistrates Court on 14 March.
