He was declared dead at the scene.” Herbst said that paramedics had to wait for technicians to isolate nearby transformers before helping the man’s seriously injured partner. “Once the connections were shut off, she was treated and stabilised in the car before being carefully removed using the jaws of life.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of culpable homicide was opened with the Tongaat police for investigation.“The circumstances surrounding the incident are still being investigated.”
