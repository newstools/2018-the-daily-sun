But unlike well-known speakers like Pastor Zondo, she encouraged women to use their punanis to make money. In a video recorded at a pool party in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga, Zodwa can be heard telling women to stop being used by men.“Ladies, you have power and you must use it. Take it from me. I am using my punani to make R35 000,” said Zodwa. “I don’t know how to dance. All I do is to shake my ass and get paid. So, my b*tches, use your punani and be yourself.”DJ Tira was not impressed by her remarks. On Thursday he tweeted: “On Monday I have a meeting with Zodwa Wabantu. Things need to change.”KZN Social Development MEC Weziwe Thusi slammed Zodwa’s comments, while lawyer and senior lecturer at the University of KZN Lesala Mofokeng warned that public indecency is still a crime. Javu Baloyi of the Commission for Gender Equality said: “This is opening the door for women to be degraded.Zodwa said: “I am sorry to those who were offended by my remarks. “I have no problem with constructive criticism but I urge my critics to guide me on how to express myself.”Tira’s phone went straight to voicemail when the SunTeam called him.
