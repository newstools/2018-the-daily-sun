THE grapevine has it that it’s a matter of days before President Jacob Zuma is shown the door as head of state.Sources close to the situation claim there is such a push from inside the organisation for him to exit that he might not even deliver the state of the nation address on 8 February.A senior member in the ANC who spoke on condition of anonymity said deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa was ready to take over as president.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst_mYNvTyfUXjvp7l2DyAUs7EKtn26Gagg8p5aXt-6RICbqhUMhj0-PgmAs3Cbgthmrk_owW7IBQgIGiMt4GLSY0ETEbK4iuPBsovSxdFqw4ce4Dfogu3KZ2sqHOQd-P73UtgwaJykwkp-v4-gCxuZyaz7Je5x176WONGEsKtf8gpBbiwAk4CMXd5mR6GessGnf09x7jsWxZ0lH6awingcxHDHIo2UOO-Swn1PkZP5O7kVtdpFpIwxSnoSv48E-T4TCfPTiS8WxwYddK7OkovlpqdgtQi4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOsg_Z4w0GuiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
