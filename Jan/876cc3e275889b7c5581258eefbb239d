THE grapevine has it that it’s a matter of days before President Jacob Zuma is shown the door as head of state.Sources close to the situation claim there is such a push from inside the organisation for him to exit that he might not even deliver the state of the nation address on 8 February.A senior member in the ANC who spoke on condition of anonymity said deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa was ready to take over as president.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuIOGKb98_SRq6sTTAfuOzKl4yrEe4jXN_ROGDL9rqSp5Z7NYI9ifKtkMT-gZZLradhBk4mzRM_9sP6MIwpvcUZrvKNjg4z_9_wsYvF4IVWxLmcxnL5jIUfd_jUfm9B_PT9n1txb4Yauje5MslkCbopMN0bTcAtOP_vZSiaFwm_nggLc6A0vOW10q8WQLiDkYKbZqPOXuFjTJ1klV1w08eyFP_XZK9P_QEz_94HYtfvlSYoL1RgFTVwRbAI5LFZ8yX75pbDmXeuL0CTD-Ye0MWcOdgDDWI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGwG6RONf5B9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
