THE grapevine has it that it’s a matter of days before President Jacob Zuma is shown the door as head of state.Sources close to the situation claim there is such a push from inside the organisation for him to exit that he might not even deliver the state of the nation address on 8 February.A senior member in the ANC who spoke on condition of anonymity said deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa was ready to take over as president.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuWcD0fhZZqZa91ReFthkhiWzBbQwwZQfLiSqE81gezmk3vLbwYCSnRAsaNndCLw_GJQkzoA8Z-CjRkxbqBLA-2x14nIgWUbXhbRW6lW7XoMM7p-u8B1FNzxQ7DVK_juHFM-bEbwhShYs1eU4zbdIOEdoVruVhML1coN_wP5gBdV-MBeMOkCqPkLZdl0YcO3CjEOWx3sJ-wWl1DUJSL3b1Cm0XevvCD_jiselHHJUzk-7Bj1cCizxLg5X01VcwoAi1SkV1wADnpUtuPVLuHMS5GZnXAVzo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPo8dpXDdDu4EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
