THE grapevine has it that it’s a matter of days before President Jacob Zuma is shown the door as head of state.Sources close to the situation claim there is such a push from inside the organisation for him to exit that he might not even deliver the state of the nation address on 8 February.A senior member in the ANC who spoke on condition of anonymity said deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa was ready to take over as president.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssQgyeaU_DyPL6QBEOpz9yL0OPDu9Kn7tsxlyMA6zOtdUb_cbqHMGISyM05PUVIxeAxMh-jIDTaQzpusmaev66EIoAan85W85mUA05nxqWb_CgBKUmpBeq81f5upVHR26TXkAHrJ8NmRrKofn6fgLdb6fsaM5r4k-E05dhcD1f6URcFx9HMxjYBxBpkQ9CtYBPN98rTS2WkfrYQ1EiI7L7vJhrQtNPLvwOgzRjk5UL-saoZrCUONBDe6ikfh11UMtXe4OrBgk4Jsdltk0X3plOgDsEcbfY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMqYUS1Lv7o6EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
