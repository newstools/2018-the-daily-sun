THE grapevine has it that it’s a matter of days before President Jacob Zuma is shown the door as head of state.Sources close to the situation claim there is such a push from inside the organisation for him to exit that he might not even deliver the state of the nation address on 8 February.A senior member in the ANC who spoke on condition of anonymity said deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa was ready to take over as president.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssbPVoV10D0kBsxBJPDIO98_7yHaIbeD9Dq6hfsDldyd5BTSMHgHPLx7plNUZiJU8N-anr3Yh7A1l5pjlOl0-1FZ-u68S106Xb5UyVLkCD6NlQMJqOi-J5p-runLZKxiUFtxOa3sBz3eRucvLohu-t6cPyLDBXA3NktoazRt_dqJeV5T-tD0xzwjzBoW49BtR-1qnbkFK-RVrDN7ia63jl47bzu4pfE6mTDisis1qXMsl9wyLD9nVTqxfyw9eRoM-5gx5Ww1K82GcyHTJ1yMCFjewrb3rw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzI3gOahmx-CkEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
