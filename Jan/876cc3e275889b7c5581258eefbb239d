THE grapevine has it that it’s a matter of days before President Jacob Zuma is shown the door as head of state.Sources close to the situation claim there is such a push from inside the organisation for him to exit that he might not even deliver the state of the nation address on 8 February.A senior member in the ANC who spoke on condition of anonymity said deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa was ready to take over as president.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuKgWTmLdO8XwBjSqgnwjatf4c009qxoIxDMNJUIKEZ6dXeJYzm4NZIth1m7YzNiRLAojfdBQiLahTleRmmoBoZ_9Pj5O-tVHmdUwXF36jZvGIDFST6OvngFHJoG-fhL7NBBk2ppRZkGTulZWU8EwnphKOR_o1SxSebCapy85qs9ra2uZIcZTJxOLvT8fUdiajFTp1eCg6CzqjxZVDpMH9eCcXEETdmSrL13Db-YV2LXhWSRv-GG_Nx8muSTMxB0gjSejGJVtEGS73mJhvk70KVvtizyi0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEmo45zCooSaEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
