THE grapevine has it that it’s a matter of days before President Jacob Zuma is shown the door as head of state.Sources close to the situation claim there is such a push from inside the organisation for him to exit that he might not even deliver the state of the nation address on 8 February.A senior member in the ANC who spoke on condition of anonymity said deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa was ready to take over as president.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssKsY-_F0mj6gEz7jakGXqn9P_LctXmTTMA9uNrpkX661vK4IgfDUN0eOHJCGOQP1yYtkLoAOqaIeGH9eLvkogr3efSb0T8kWs7jvdhPZxvk4q2CkIJ-wJCH7xVUHDB_LnYsaY5NynqXrsvQ7QLJJ8LsfJ6xDaMcOlDRpyYXVZ4RCdn1SyiufiW7-vzxLWRWFeXy2Zya9PCxCupuwGoBU-fdj4tPO7M9J2Kku5scTx13dBpWKBJljtZYBOQMt9KhfkRfgPhEnaO6HqoN7BaKTsp23J2sgw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPF1umEnjlMIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
