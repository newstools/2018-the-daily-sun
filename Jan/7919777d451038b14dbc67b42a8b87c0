Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has been
accused of intentionally failing to inform the Constitutional Court that Sassa
would not meet its court-appointed deadline to withdraw its contract with Cash
Paymaster Services (CPS). Dlamini was under cross-examination on Thursday at the
Office of the Chief Justice during an inquiry into her personal role in the
social security agency crisis.The inquiry is also investigating whether she should be held
personally liable for costs incurred during the crisis in 2016/17.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvPJoOlvemuWqEGR0fDLU56EvtqVIvPlXS_Ysjc_Pzlm7xVbXoMsqHhxwsNpg0-aS_D9u8ydTPXkeWa_a1APLJ7iqwhgwyvdAmptoTNSLLoMT4PooBJ2AKeqLcSa3Nz_Ymu9vfN1HeVQlGNSVtfAkRGeF7HBDukR4c6BIeKdTjhSRo-HpDZDNPUq2i5aDTrAGP-vOT26Cw7ZqkZH5WpIVXGaRFvLRpCt0aPSy4L1OKFdmlpj37Ca6pPT90SY9LV1u0wBgx6Vh68zsl59dkjyqRfN7lRnt0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOsvpoje7z1QEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

representing former Sassa director general Zane Dangor, said Dlamini was warned
that the agency would not meet its March deadline.The Constitutional Court had found that its contract with
CPS, the company in charge of distributing its grants was unlawful. The court
gave Sassa until March 2017 to find an alternative option for distribution.Maleka however, argued that Dlamini knew as early as October
2016 that Sassa would not meet the court deadline. He said Dangor had indicated to Dlamini that the Sassa grant
crisis would have a negative effect on her politically and the country's ruling
party, the ANC. Maleka said Dangor had also made proposals to mitigate the
problem, including a request to the court that it continues with a short-term
contract with CPS. "Mr Dangor was clear that you have to inform the
[Constitutional Court], but Sassa did not approach the court immediately to
inform the court of the delay," Maleka put to Dlamini.She admitted that she failed to inform the courts
immediately after Dangor's warning. However, she defended her action, saying
that they first had to rearrange the work phase and streamline their work. In December 2016, then CEO Thokozani Magwaza signed an
affidavit to submit to the Constitutional Court, which stated that the social
security agency would not meet its March 2017 deadline, but Dlamini withdrew
it, Maleka said.Dlamini responded that she withdrew the affidavit because it
was "arrogant". "We needed to own up and accept responsibility in
court," she added. The Constitutional Court appointed Judge Bernard Ngoepe to
head the inquiry to investigate whether Dlamini sought the appointment of
individuals to lead the various "workstreams" to report directly to
her.The three workstreams - which were "information and
business management", "banking services and project management,
legislative and policy requirements management", and "benefits and
local economic development" - appeared to exist parallel to the function
of the department and Sassa.The leaders of these workstreams acted as advisors to
Dlamini before they were appointed to lead the workstreams - a move that was
said to be illegal and irregular.The Constitutional Court also ordered the inquiry to
investigate the detail, including when the people were appointed, who they
reported to, and details of the dates and contents of the workstreams' report
to the minister.Lastly, the inquiry is looking into why the minister did not
disclose this information to the Constitutional Court.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/bathabile-dlamini-admits-she-failed-to-inform-concourt-promptly-about-sassa-deadline-delay-20180125
