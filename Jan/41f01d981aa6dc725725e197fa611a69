Zuma's opponents have argued that the party needs to start on a "clean slate" ahead of the 2019 elections.Magashule has, however, confirmed that the ANC NEC – the party's second highest decision-making body – discussed Zuma's recall.News24 reported on Friday that the motion to recall Zuma was raised by newly elected NEC member David Masondo and backed by Deputy Minister of Agriculture Bheki Cele.Magashule said engagements between Zuma and the officials related to the work of government."It is a matter of interaction. Ramaphosa and Zuma are talking about coordination between Luthuli House and government. There isn't any rumour or decision to remove Jacob Zuma as some say on social media," he said.He also denied that there was a deadline for Zuma to step down."So there are no timelines here, we don't do things that way. We engage, we process things, we discuss, so give us space as the ANC to deal with our matters."Earlier on Monday, Zuma indicated that he was staying in office, releasing a diary of his official engagements until mid-February that include giving the State Of The Nation Address on February 8.The ANC has also confirmed that it has suspended the provincial executive committees of KwaZulu-Natal, led by Sihle Zikalala, and the Free State led by Magashule.They have also been instructed to stop their appeals on court decisions that ruled that their respective elective conferences were invalid."We don't want to solve our matters in court. The leadership of the two provinces was engaged and it was agreed to solve problems internally," Magashule said.Previously Magashule had said that the provincial leaders had remained in office because they had lodged appeals.Magashule said the ANC's top six officials would visit KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday and the Free State on Wednesday to announce the members of interim leadership to oversee fresh elections.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/there-is-no-decision-that-zuma-must-go-magashule-20180122
