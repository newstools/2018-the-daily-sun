    We need real role models – not speedsters and drunk drivers. It’s clear that drivers don’t listen and obey the rules of the road. Thabo Rakhale’s arrest for drunken driving is an example of this. He should be fighting to regain his fitness and regularly get on the field for his new team, Chippa United. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst24Vy3zx-js2JRqB5nTZ3yK0QzH7wDflLB2foAAjNNaSXuoDDUSXRSX_wbNYSCkGHu5sXKv2dyoP4sBBp88DctBc1LJbXCYm2QiYHJAZ2dM-GJ200GjHOUbX0W9WQQOLEx23-kLzKxpIadvw7j1i6KRdIUfKXqRDF5oZ55hfZ7e4zawB_Q_YPCl2Esl6FhKfD3dgcThwJQzq-tn6rq6m_tIRt-jjbroFBXfN3pClChYBBDfxknVNdOxTuwjX8zjf8X0e6uUkuGG-diAtzu6YSnTWT4dgo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCZJU4sNTcUMEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Last year Happy Jele of Orlando Pirates was caught speeding. Our players are not responsible. They are an embarrassment to the soccer profession.Let us hope that this incident will not affect Thabo’s career. People should not even start justifying such unruly behaviour by saying that other celebrities did the same thing. Our players don’t behave like leaders. Players or celebrities must not drive when drunk because they will end up on the wrong side of the law. They must take a taxi after drinking or allow their girlfriends to drive them home. Drinking alcohol is not a sin, but it becomes a problem when you’re drunk and disturb others on the road or crash into houses. What players do off the field is their own business, but if it’s against the law and affects others, it becomes a crisis. Slight Ramphaka, Florida
