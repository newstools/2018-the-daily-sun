honesty!According to Daily
Monitor, Museveni was speaking at the opening of the East African
Legislative Assembly in Kampala yesterday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvJCFifMCBvkujxtjVk5gVnmQ0JGCf_Ql66XKLz1K11AA7bCnZi_IhgEea9yfSi7PoMng57pjVUUBDQ9G1LDf1qfgj_l6I5WDY0x5pxfBgkBT08L5YDEI9qT0qlj7KTfcOQT2NTLLT8A4Kb5ytZ-ysVQzCiDGUnGAlUm9Q1ja9x7aZrHZnbRLHoja22HDmWbIPxybtzcGgjPuyLSQCrnKrZAMfTijWuktOkhdMhDtSIYiXa5t6CPOVtsIxg0dHYnSFPQ0TVZjiny7VE2Hx1OpdoRe1i-QaOIxFO1A\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEmvgD9KgfQiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

quotes Museveni as saying: “I love Trump because he tells Africans frankly. I
don't know whether he's misquoted or whatever. He talks to Africans frankly. In
the world, you cannot survive if you're weak......that's why we need East
African integration." Earlier this
month, Trump caused yet another public outcry when he reportedly questioned
why America would want to have immigrants from Haiti and African nations,
referring to some as “shithole countries”. He reportedly said they
should rather get immigrants from Norway.Trump has since denied he said it.But the American ambassador to Uganda, Deborah Malac, is more critical of her
president’s alleged insult to African countries. According to the report, Malac
said: “Obviously for people like me and many of my colleagues who have spent
many years working in Africa, have many relationships and friendships across
the continent, [the comments] are obviously quite disturbing and upsetting.“…I can assure
you that we remain engaged and committed to working not just in Uganda but in
all the other countries that we work with on the continent and our programmes
continue.”
