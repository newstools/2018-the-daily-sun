Our lives are put in danger by people close to us,” he said.Western Cape police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said residents called the cops after they spotted a suspicious-looking vehicle in their neighbourhood.“Police tracked and searched the vehicle. “A preliminary investigation was conducted and it was revealed that the suspects had been involved in an ATM robbing in Strand.“The suspects, five men and a woman aged between 26 and 41, were arrested. “Once charged they will appear in court,” said Rwexana.The robbery affected the bank’s service and left some customers furious.Asanda Madiki (32), a resident, said: “The ATMs were convenient because they were close to our kasi. Now I have to travel by taxi to get to the nearest ATM. “These criminals must be locked away for good.”
