I’m glad the media is paying attention to this. Addo has many poor people who need houses,” she said. “Obviously this house has a beneficiary. The municipality should trace the owner and find out why the person is not living in the house.” Another resident said the cattle made a lot of noise and attracted flies and mosquitoes. “Since when have animals started living in houses? This is happening right on the main road where everyone can see. “What is the municipality saying about this?” Sundays River Valley municipal manager Sydney Fadi promised to investigate the matter. “It’s illegal to convert a government house for purposes other than living in it. You are not even allowed to operate a shebeen from an RDP,” he said. “If we get complaints from residents, we send in law enforcement officers. “The owner will be given a notice to comply with the outcome of the investigation.”Efforts to reach the owner of the cattle were unsuccessful. The residents said the animals belonged to people living across the road from the RDP but when the SunTeam approached them, they denied the animals were theirs.
