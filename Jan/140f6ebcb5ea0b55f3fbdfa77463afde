We decided to start here to interest pupils and teachers in the app. Feedback has been awesome so far.” She stressed that it does not replace teachers but is a study aid, complementing work done in the classroom.On Saturday, parents and pupils flocked to the roadshow at Circus Triangle Mall to hear more about the app and win freebies. Ikwezi Skill Centre grade 12 pupil Lutho Qashani said the app will make learning easier. “We spend a lot of money on tutors but with this app, it’s like having tutors on our phones. It will be easier to learn because we are always on our smartphones.”Excited Unathi Tsengwa (19), who passed grade 12 last year but wasn’t happy with her maths marks, said the app is the key to her future as she wants to study medicine.The app is available on www.sigmax.co.za, as well as on Google Play.
