On Friday, teachers who had come to issue results to pupils found the ceiling damaged and a window broken. Thugs had gained entry through the roof and again fled with two computers. Several offices were ransacked but nothing was stolen.SGB treasurer Mishack Sihlangu said there had been several attempted break-ins in December. He said the burglaries have left the school in ruins. “Several windows were broken by thugs. They also removed an iron sheet on the roof. Soon this school will look deserted.” He said he suspected the robberies were an inside job.“These thugs target rooms where there are electronic devices.“It could be that we are being attacked by someone who knows this school well.” He said the computer theft was a setback for the school. A teacher said the burglaries would stop if the school hired security guards to be on duty at night. “The school is guarded by CPF members during the day but at night there is no one here.” Mamelodi East police spokesman, Captain Michael Mbewe, said a case of business robbery was opened and police are investigating.Gauteng Department of Education spokesman Steve Mabona said they condemned the break-in and theft at the school.“We’ll work with the school to help them recover information they may have lost due to the theft of computers.”
