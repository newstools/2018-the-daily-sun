    IT has been dubbed the game of the weekend considering the importance of this Absa Premiership showdown between Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm).Pirates have not beaten Sundowns in their last seven meetings, and Bucs’ current coach Mulitin “Micho” Sredejovic has indicated that he wants to put a stop to this hoodoo against his team.And Pirates’ former captain, Oupa “Ace” Manyisa, who has since moved to Sundowns, says they will not apply anything special for this match but play their normal game.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu3MSZGJfSYWhoy199wLskTm3Yne5vGK4bHZxjNZnH2F0SddqHtFWpCVPur6ls8r6z0oALW_GL7DXVv5kOPq7td5qhNJNNqUKM7pTfESQ8fjQ_nTMaUMlc5eipVS5vktsz7t3-q3KeGZqm1EmvnSptaXjg3ZLCc5YfRpYYHwLmEYq_aar6vztFhoNX_XY9peX8L8KnOVgynLk20vc5gWTJdOfyJ7mJqVGNatJtYdnpwZS0HypA7H4rzo2PzenipgoWhobYWYY13QwDvv5blS6J0Dw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLplir4GSnSNEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

This is an important game that we have to win at all costs. A win for us is non-negotiable. We have to keep that smile on the supporters’ faces, and ensure we hold on to our position at the top. We need to engage each other and not hold back because fans need goals and entertainment.”There was chaos and pitch invasions the last time the two sides met at Loftus Stadium, after Sundowns put six without reply to Pirates, and fans started losing it. And the whole mayhem was caused by goals from Percy Tau’s brace, Thapelo Morena two goals and those from Themba Zwane and Ricardo Nascimento.The Brazilians are currently four points at the top of the log with 31 points, while Benni McCarthy’s Cape Town City FC are hot on their heels with 27 with 16 matches played.Pirates are gradually recovering from their bad start to the season, and they are now fifth on the log, equal with township rivals Kaizer Chiefs on 23 points, also from 16 matches played.Bucs’ 3-1 win over Baroka FC last week must have injected more confidence in the team like Luvuyo Memela’s brace and Musa Nyatama settling nicely.Bucs midfielder Bernard Morrison and rearguard Ntsikelelo Nyauza are not available for this match due to injury, but the club this week confirmed that Thabo “Section 10” Qalinge is back. Also suspended is Thabo Matlaba.) Meanwhile, Sundowns are believed to be patiently waiting on the arrival of their new South American signing, Gaston Sirino, from Uruguay and Jeremy Brockie from SuperSport United.Indications are that Sirino will be jumping in place of Leonardo Castro who has since moved to Chiefs.It is believed that Downs coach Pitso Mosimane is happy about the ex-Bolivar striker, but other technical team members are not sure about his scoring prowess.“The stats on him are not consistent,” said a Downs official. Sometimes he scores nine goals per season in the Copa Sudamericana but at times he would go six matches without a goal.”
