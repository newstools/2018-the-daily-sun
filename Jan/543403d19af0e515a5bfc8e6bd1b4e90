A nurse who stood outside the clinic with her colleagues said: “There’s no parking at the clinic and we have to park outside where it’s not safe. Several nurses have been hijacked and we are worried that our cars will be stolen.” Nompilo Mchunu (35) said she had to go to a clinic in Ntuzuma because when she arrived at Inanda she found the nurses were not working on Friday. “I think the department should act fast because this is affecting us badly.” Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that cases of attempted hijacking outside the clinic had been opened at the beginning of the year.“The sector commander gave the nurses permission to park their cars temporarily at the satellite police station,” said Gwala.Health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said: “The department wishes to convey its empathy to the affected staff members. “Officials visited the clinic and met management, the ward councillor, community health members and cops.“Steps will be taken to strengthen security in and around the clinic to ensure that healthcare continues. “The police will do more patrols in the area and the security company has agreed to return to work.”
