Little did I know that I’d be beaten for nothing,” he said.Bongani said had he not pretended to be dead, he would be lying in a grave today.“I was walking in the bush when I met the cops. They stopped me and asked where I was coming from. I answered them and they started to search me. “When they couldn’t find anything, they started to beat me. I was stripped, had water poured on me and was left for dead.” His mum, Nomsa Ndwandwe, said Bongani was brought home limping by a stranger.“The man said he found Bongani naked and unconscious in the bush.“We rushed him to Nigel Police Station and cops sent us back to Duduza, which is our nearest cop shop.”“Duduza cops advised us to go to the police station where the incident happened. But in Nigel they refused to help us,” said Nomsa. She said they were eventually given a form by the Duduza cops in order to take Bongani to hospital. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said: “Neither the cops at Duduza nor Nigel should have turned Bongani back. “He should return and open a case and if the cops still don’t help him, he should ask to see the station commander.”
