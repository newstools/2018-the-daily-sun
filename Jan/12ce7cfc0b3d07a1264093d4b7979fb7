UNDER fire Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille says it’s unfair of the DA to blame her for the downgrade of the City’s audit findings from clean to unqualified.“The Auditor-General said that the leadership of the City - that includes the Chief Financial Officer, the City Manager and the Executive Directors - all have got a role to play in terms of the Municipal Finance Management Act. So to make a blanket statement that I'm to blame for everything is simply not true,” said De Lille.According to Auditor General’s report the downgrade was as a result financial mismanagement in the city council under her leadership. The financial statements handed to the Auditor-General’s office in September 2017 shows irregular expenditure of more than R47m.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst_ixPOr7DIAqBCHiasEB62urJ5bP56xENLfHSJjaX1r0w699mso1-akd0J1UscQWdNQ-bM08Yq6v-L43Tkne6wctMSzpD5ud37K1xWot6nW6CJ9dpwLtz9iTu0fpKFoNii0SgAnJlBH_OzdaRIDA7jkHR7mlZJZh7JZYPtIyKa56RyTVcwX1aO8yFF_yaMpV067Ov2CbJoOW61WIwUCof_Uu0pN_mk8hl737-hsWVtavFt5p142ArjMrBLzPLhCpKmWvsQiRWIy4xuHLUayq1pxELsPuA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHHG2IOTm4SwEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

De Lille was accused of trying to bury the corruption.ANC leader in Council Xolani Sotashe also said a figure of R140 000 was recorded as an incident of ‘non-compliance with Remuneration of Public Office Bearers Act’‚ believed to be related to upgrades at De Lille’s home. The Auditor General’s office has allegedly flagged it as irregularity.In her defense De Lille said according to the law the role of the Mayor of the City is only to give political direction. She said the Mayor is not allowed to interfere with the administration and other City officials should also be held responsible for the Cape Town's audit findings and downgrade.Sotashe said the DA should take collective responsibility for the City's audit findings and not De Lille only.“The Auditor General has tried to expose some serious material findings in the report so heads must roll. These are issues we've been raising and people have been denying. The DA must own up. They can't reduce this matter to an individual now, this individual being De Lille. When they were doing well all of them claimed the victory. They claimed they are running a good municipality but now, faced with all these challenges, they are reducing it to one individual.”
