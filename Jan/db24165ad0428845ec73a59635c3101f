    Minister of
Police Fikile Mbalula has condemned the violence that brought Rustenburg to a
standstill on Wednesday afternoon and appealed with communities to work with
police."No
matter how justified people might think they are, taking the law into their own
hands does not make them different to the people they accuse of being
criminals."People
must know we are a democratic state, with competent institutions to resolve
these matters," a statement from Mbalula's office read.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst3pjUDZ6ogVMdEQYRTEGC00k2-InGR9T1BRID0ZBRjfDm5fUSP8bDmy5ma6QBm15MRNHdy9Ye_ZVGzE6xaz2yzewaxq2ccChR-x40mpJBcTeIZ09j11H5nWHTPykwzi2r2_Y4OJSGGQBiez8b97jejsNVl2Duzvx5-028YJkUDDKMLiuNCoi5R0IppEVGpNFBglNso6AHT0RQQt9nRMhqV30bN_YfZtZC2Fwhmz5CPHtvSfkqsTXsZeRLuPQJAClpT7KFFYOxXRIc1Nc_lmcbgp6qfBL0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGKDzx8Vd1N5EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

houses were torched at 18:00 on Wednesday, after violence erupted at a local
taxi rank.Rustenburg
Mayor Mpho Khunou claims that the protests were a case of mob justice."Members
of the community, together with the taxi drivers, targeted areas well-known for
drugs, prostitution and human trafficking," he said."We
worked with the police all through the night at the Rustenburg Civic Centre and
eventually we reached a level of calm. There have been no disturbances
since," Khunou added.Preparing
for possible unrestHowever,
police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone predicts that there may be
continued disturbances."Things
went quiet at around 21:00 last night, but we are prepared for more unrest and
we have deployed teams on the ground," he confirmed.Mbalula
also called for the local police to work with members of the public."Police
must smoke criminals out of our communities, but our people must work close
with the police. If the local police fail them, they must escalate the
matter."Police are
investigating the events leading up to the unrest."We
can't say anything at this stage, but we are investigating. At the moment there
are a number of people coming forward with allegations, so we can only comment
after the investigation has been concluded," Mokgwabone added.He
confirmed that a police officer was arrested, but made it clear that the arrest
was unrelated to the protests."A
policeman was arrested for allegedly dealing drugs, but this happened before
the protests. It is unrelated," he said.Both Khunou
and Mokgwabane warned the public against taking the law into their own hands."We
understand the concerns of the community, but these things must be dealt with
within the confines of the law," said Khunou.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mbalula-condemns-rustenburg-violence-20180111
