We are looking for at least a loan deal. But they have yet to get back to me. “I’m hopeful, though, that they will get back to me and that we will have him before the transfer window closes.”Kadodia has since abandoned his interest in midfielder Keagan Buchanan, rather opting for Twala “who will suit our style of play”.The Team of Choice boss also voiced his disappointment about his team’s 1-1 home draw with Chippa United: “I think a lapse in concentration by my players caused our downfall. We conceded a goal right at the end of the match. But we will learn from such mistakes.”He said his main goal was to see coach Fadlu Davids lead them to a top eight finish at the end of the season.Their next assignment is away to Orlando Pirates on Saturday.
