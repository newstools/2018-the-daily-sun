CAPE TOWN mayor Patricia de Lille has called on Capetonians to do more to save water.This week, Day Zero was moved to 21 April. Day Zero is when the City will be forced to turn off most of its taps and every resident will have to queue for 25 litres of water per day.During the past week, only 39% of Cape Town’s residents used less than 87 litres of water a day, compared to 54% during the first week of January.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuSkGx18LK_0MmUoGH1sMWG6EnEUfA68eA4is_yADWOvS93FEza-HkZFoXF-xIDaTgQyhqNzEDLlWm56zYROP0_e50zGYGI3mC_qBtr0fb6y27HZW-W3sHWIkMgfN0OSJLKC6hY3MIR-soKJXVblYffVKvtlW6XBtpHzrROoNeCV-HbMqrnwFRhMrFUVv8RxctUVmOdRz8HNhA4YT5F-b_E-YFHb93hHvW6LVJsntrk_LzrbONc_j3DFJYePSE4e4m8DZKYfTYEdjw0JioWOzJXP5Lhoy8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLS_N5OBklf5EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Cape Town’s average daily collective consumption is still too high. It has increased from 578 million to 618 million litres per day“For each day that Cape Town uses more than 500 million litres, the city moves closer to Day Zero. Dam levels have dipped to 28,7% this past week. Only about 18,7% of this water is usable as the last 10% is difficult to extract from the dams.“The City has ramped up pressure management to drive down consumption and stretch our water supply past winter.“We have identified 25 areas across the city that could benefit from this pressure management technology over the next three months and contractors have been brought in to speed up the programme.”Level 6 water restrictions, effective from 1 January, aim to drive down consumption. All households that use more than 10,5 kilolitres per month will have a water management device fitted to their water supply.“We must stay committed to saving water. “It is the only way Cape Town can avoid Day Zero. The City will continue working with residents to ensure Cape Town’s taps don’t run dry. “It is up to every resident to do his and her part to save water while we still have water to save.”
