It focuses on the need for businesses to have a purpose beyond profit. Setting up an employee volunteering programme and giving employees paid time off to volunteer for important causes is likely to enhance your employees’ skills, encourage team-building and create a positive business culture.

Research conducted by Cass Business School and Cranfield School of Management suggests a positive association between informal and formal flexible working arrangements and job satisfaction and organisational commitment. Try gamification Encouraging fun and healthy competition leads to better results. This is the idea behind gamification: It is the process of introducing game elements into various activities to help motivate, engage and keep employees and customers. Gamification typically includes badges, leader boards, points and progression and can be used for employee engagement in daily operations. With recognition often an important factor in high productivity and morale, gamification can be a way for employees to get quick feedback.
