Kagiso Police are concerned about the resurfacing of trucks/ bakkies hijackings. They cannot be traced to a certain specific hot spot, but can be spotted as far as from Johannesburg to Swaneville, Tshepisong, Soweto, etc. In 2017 Kagiso SAPS registered a number of complaints on hijacking of bakkies / trucks, but  later arrested a woman and three suspects believed to have been behind those crimes. The victims were allegedly lured into believing that they were hired to transport goods. Most hijackings took place between Johannesburg and Swaneville at  Kagiso. Most victims were dropped off on an open space near Swaneville.  Kagiso SAPS however warned truck/ bakkie owners to be more cautious about the common tricks that the criminals used. It is worrying that there are some people who still fall victims to the same old tricks. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvlkFYHvP2NEjvEU9pJGZoqMqlK4GXThW1GEQYZS1FoRMUlGr3pQJIW8rhUHkuRnaDluPhU0qL5HZ1EJb2vFbMxciDqou8VwzJ-XzctBlcnJRF34Pb8yozcKqoKwnRKmOXzjAnXxYT03_NAtR8-s3hUJxt2yq8INjz_RnDbfNG11J2IfRhhWlRS-leOitHBg_KCeTVrxGVkdWDjM5jXwtvD633jBM_yAcVWQWAGm43-KgRA8IL493Yj9IOpYDuK6A3vsNAKtRIp5HTcwcFG5MdQhj7JPIM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPMpqUdppL1BEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Both parties agreed on transporting costs and arranged to meet on Thursday at 10:00 at Moses Shops on Impala road. On Thursday morning before 10:00 am  an unknown man called and told the complainant that the woman asked him to assist her in picking up the goods. The man then met the complainant at Moses and they left for Protea. They further picked up three (3) other suspects who according to the first suspect, were also going to assist. The complainant was later pointed with a firearm and ordered to drive to Swaneville where his white Nissan LDV was taken. He was left on an open field with his hands bound.
