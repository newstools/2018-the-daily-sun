He likes large helpings of chilli. He eats fast, puts all the items worth stealing into a backpack and then slips away. Cops are hunting for him.Daily Sun spoke to some of the victims, who said they were still traumatised.“We didn’t want to die so we did as we were told,” said a victim.“It was about dinner time when he knocked. When we opened the door, he pointed a gun at us and ordered us to sit down at the table while he had his food. He warned us not to try calling the cops and promised not to harm anyone. He seemed like a humble guy.” Sergeant Manaka said although he hasn’t harmed anyone, the cops are taking the matter seriously.“Because there is a firearm involved this is still a very serious crime,” he said. “We need all the help we can get to nab this suspect because one day he might shoot someone.” Manaka said at least ten cases of robbery have been opened at Duduza Police Station.“The suspect is tall and dark and he wears a black T-shirt and a hoodie,” said Manaka.Anyone who has information is asked to contact Constable Mluleki Maphempeni on 081 316 1241.
