    FRANK Makgoba is a master of his craft and can make almost anything out of clay. The 49-year-old from Mohlohlo Village in Mokopane, Limpopo, makes vases, calabashes and water features. He told Daily Sun he grew up making sculptures of cows, tractors and humans from the clay he found in the Thwathwe River. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvPE7AgrM14VzjRc-A1gC5UMxKtPnohslljwtiPA9LGC3OBWLmvflYZda3o8GWLNXfU4c6NwTjdi-tL7KvS9bmmJAfPbl6NlxqgVA_mIS0qwXjczrExy8c4pnAay629Cfn7TLcjSyblG9Z1qtyUBBF4twnFQ5LH982W8deeOL2PzpKzyd_P1F7ISLNd7C9OLPHeIF5vmuGg-tvIWHRarU5ik8p9j_Di4BowoSCXYJ_tuK-fOrdr657XfL0SRfHZbGjx2XqApGtkFY6Mj3MEDcYTEhWIkzU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzL5D0wGeNOmeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I always thought ceramic materials were made from bones,” he said. In 1989 Frank started working as a general labourer at a pottery factory in Tshwane. “My boss noticed my passion for pottery and sent me to Babelege Pottery School in Hammanskraal, where I learnt the basics,” he said. Frank said he later went to work in Germiston, Ekurhuleni, where he made garden and water features out of clay. “This was where I implemented all the skills I was taught,” he said. Frank said he was taught many skills by his gogo, Ramokane. “I used to prepare clay soil for her and she made calabashes. Pottery has kept me away from bad company and I have been able to use it to build a future. I am a family man who makes my living with soil,” he said.He said he and four other people would be opening the Kerona Art and Craft Organisation in Mokopane next month. They plan to train 200 people. “We decided to start the organisation after realising there were a lot of people who had dropped out of school and were looking for jobs at the mines.“The mines cannot employ everyone. If we empower our community with pottery skills, they can supply mines with cups and bowls.”
