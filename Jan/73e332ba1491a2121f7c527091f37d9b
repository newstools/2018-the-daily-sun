We have to resort to manual authorisation of trains, which is slow and leads to train accidents.”Motampi said theft is affecting train services badly.“Theft and vandalism of Metrorail rolling stock and infrastructure has a devastating impact on the service and economy of the province, with direct replacement costs of over R200 million per annum for Gauteng. “We hope the cops will deal harshly with the arrested scrapyard owner, and send a strong message to anyone dealing with stolen railway component. “We are confident more stolen material will be found once the entire neighbourhood’s scrapyards have been thoroughly searched.”
