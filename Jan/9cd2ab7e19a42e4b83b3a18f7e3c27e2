FIRST year students at varsity must prepare for excitement and opportunities, but also make their own success.Dr Gillian Mooney, dean of academic development and support at the Independent Institute of Education, said the demands of school and the demands of higher education are different, and new students need to know how to handle new challenges.“This is especially true for students who excelled at school without too much effort – they need to understand that winging it is no longer an option.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Tshidi Mathibe, head of programmes at the institute’s Faculty of Commerce, said: “University is intimidating but by being prepared and informed, you will be able to respond in a mature manner which will dramatically increase your chances of success.”- Attend orientation week, or O-Week, which is held a week before classes start. It is not compulsory to attend but it is a great chance to meet new people and learn about campus life- Every new student is just as anxious as you are to make friends“You will meet lots of people who may be very different from you.“There will be people from different cultures, economic backgrounds and academic levels. “This is an opportunity for you to have new experiences.”- It is a very good idea to make a friend in each class that you have. This will allow you to discuss the course material and have someone to take notes for you if you have to miss a class – but don’t make a habit of it! - Understand the difference between lectures and tutorials. Lectures are generally large classes – often with hundreds of people in large venues – particularly if you are attending a public university. Make an effort to attend every lecture and tutorial, as lecturers and tutors are there to explain difficult concepts and to help you with your studies.”- You may feel invisible. At school, your teacher knew your name. But at a university with large classes, it won’t be possible for a lecturer to learn all the names of hundreds of students. “The most important thing to remember, as you enter higher education, is that there will be no spoon-feeding and that you are in charge of your own learning.“If you miss a lecture, or do not submit an assignment, no one will care or push you to do the work. If you are having problems, it is important to get help as soon as possible. University is where you sink or swim.”
