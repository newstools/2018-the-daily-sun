Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has promised residents of Kagiso, outside Krugersdorp on the West Rand, that he will get rid of corrupt police officers in the area. "If the police are corrupt here, I must get rid of corrupt elements. If there are elements here that are not assisting in law enforcement, I must deal with that," Mbalula said. The minister was speaking at the local sports stadium in Kagiso on Tuesday where hundreds of residents gathered. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuH7yZp0uK8L6BJLi2SKuaPLb6FlcNJHre4u3xph4qeOJ15ivaKCrjNnMhI5p-l4mwp4afFmXyr8HDoAaea0nyU45aa2-FPLdIkfdvepft4rANCo9yKiKmxyBZGwWMhMTILCWeHDo_Z1reb4NLnF5mOekdheHTRNJ8lpU2yneQikAEQUG2msxwEbnjRgTQC43EAf3WYfuxufutCOPCwoVehnR8g-2FHyKW0S1ZSml7pLvkujfAKBluj-ql8HOHWJrpYp6z4naiuiqGQ-aAUKw826-LMP6I\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGYr0ny6lRFNEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

For them to do what they are doing, it means I must come to the party. I can't complain from my Twitter box or Facebook."Mbalula said anyone who was in the country unlawfully and promoted criminal activities would be locked up. "Whether they are coming from Nigeria or wherever they are coming from, I must fix them and put them in their place and lock them up," he said.  Mbalula had also launched phase two of Operation Fiela on Tuesday. The first operation was launched in 2015, with its main focus on illegal immigrants.  "We can't agree to exist with criminal activity. Enough is enough."  http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mbalulas-promise-kagiso-residents-i-will-get-rid-of-corrupt-cops-in-your-area-20180123
