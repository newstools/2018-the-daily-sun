Kubayi-Ngubane said that all would be explained when Gigaba tabled his budget in February.Mkhize said the process would be phased in over five years.The threshold to qualify for financial assistance has been raised from R122 000 per household per annum to the sum of R350 000.Full bursaries for tuition and study materials for qualifying South African students will be provided for study at public TVET colleges and universities.There will also be subsidised accommodation or transport. This will be capped at specific levels for those who qualify, starting with students who first enter tertiary education in 2018.NSFAS packages already allocated to returning or existing students this year will be converted from loans to bursaries, provided that they meet the academic progression requirements.– NEWS24
