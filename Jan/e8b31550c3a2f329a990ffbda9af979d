Maritzburg, which suffered a 1-0 defeat on Wednesday, went back to its winning ways when it defeated Free State Stars 3-0.On Sunday, Kaizer Chiefs came from behind to defeat Baroka FC. The victory ended a four-match hoodoo that Bakgaga held over Chiefs. Amakhosi had failed to beat the Limpopo outfit in any of their previous four meetings in all competitions dating back to April 2011.Chiefs’ major January signing, striker Leonardo Castro, showed why they were so keen to sign him when he snatched a late winner six minutes from time on debut to earn 10-man Amakhosi a 2-1 Absa Premiership win over Baroka. AmaZulu also registered an important victory – and heaped more misery on SuperSport United – when they defeated SuperSport 2-0 in Durban. Usuthu’s marks man Siyabonga Nomvethe, who is currently holding the league all-time goal scorer title, continued banging in the goals as he scored the first goal of the match before Ovidy Karuru killed off the match in the dying stages, ensuring SuperSport went home empty handed.
