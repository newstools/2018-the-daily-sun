We must force them,” she said.“We have listened to the comments of thousands of residents asking for fairness. Council will on Friday be voting on a punitive tariff that will charge residents exponentially higher rates for water usage above 6 000 litres per month.”However, Zille spoke about how important it is for the City to be prepared for Day Zero.The SAB will also assist in bottling and distributing water which will be taken from the Newlands Spring.
