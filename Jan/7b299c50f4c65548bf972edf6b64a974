She said she had a small role for me with potential for growth.” Khayakazi has been playing Martha for over a year. She said she likes her character because she is kind and helpful.“Just like me,” said Khayakazi.As a teenager back home, the actress was an active member of the Masazane Club, which taught traditional dancing, poetry, singing and acting. They performed around the Eastern Cape and that’s when she fell in love with acting.“I also imitated church members. I used to mimic how they preached, prayed and walked. Little did I know it would become my career one day.” Khayakazi studied public relations and communications at the University of Joburg. She also attended acting workshops to sharpen her skills.Khayakazi said her craft taught her to be determined and to have patience. “I didn’t always have work but stood firm and believed my career would take off, no matter how long it took,” said Khayakazi.“I prayed for the role of Martha and got it. You name what you want,” said Khayakazi.
