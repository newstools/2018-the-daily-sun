In the morning I discovered the bowl and the muthi was gone. “I’m left with only the steel rod that I use to crush the muthi. This will affect my business badly.”She said she suspects the people who stole her muthi are going to sell it to other sangomas. “Nobody can buy the muthi except other traditional healers.”Sangoma Ester said she travelled to Swaziland during the festive season to dig for the roots to make the muthi.“Getting to the roots is not easy. You have to speak to the ancestors and wait for them to guide you and show you where to dig,” she said.“But these ruthless thugs just came in and took what they didn’t work for. They waited for me to leave my indumba so they could sneak in. They will pay a heavy price.”She said she is frustrated because the bowl was a gift from the ancestors. “It used to give fine muthi. Those people better bring it back.”Sangoma Ester said the good luck muthi is used to wash away bad luck.“This muthi is used for people who want jobs and who want their relationships to work and generally for anyone who wants things to go well in life. My special muthi is made from ingredients that come from a different country. But it will bring only bad luck to those who stole it.”
