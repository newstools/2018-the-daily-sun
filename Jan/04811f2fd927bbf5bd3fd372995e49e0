He
wanted to pet the horse.” But he admitted to cops that he had “molested” Polly.Worse, it seems it wasn’t the first time. Francine said
she had noticed that Polly’s stall in the barn had been messed with several
times through the last month.Francine told NBC15: "I would say seven, maybe 10, times."Toilet paper had been left. The hay stacks had been
removed."Items had been turned over. And that's as far as I
want to go."Bennett faces charges of sexual misconduct, criminal
trespassing and having burglar’s tools.The official warrant also lists the crime of bestiality,
which is sexual intercourse with an animal.His trial is set to begin on 18 January.Francine hopes that the judgment includes help for the
disturbed young man."I sincerely hope the judge mandates that he goes
for psychiatric help not a slap on the wrist,” she told NBC 15.
