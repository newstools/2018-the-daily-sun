Dineo was put in a wheelchair and had to wait seven hours before being helped.“We arrived at hospital after my daughter collapsed at home. “She only was given medical attention after she fell out of the wheelchair and she died the next morning.” Dineo’s cousin, Lehlohonolo Buthelezi (23), said staff made the family wait outside and shouted at them when they went into the hospital to check on her. “We begged them to treat Dineo but they were unwilling to do so until she fell. When they finally got her a bed, she was almost dead. We blame them for killing my cousin. “She was never sick before her husband died.” Lehlohonolo said the family laid criminal charges at Vosloorus Police Station. Captain Mega Ndobe said an inquest docket was being investigated.CEO Nomonde Mqhayi-Mbambo said they are very unhappy. Dineo waited for over six hours without been seen by a doctor and allegedly fell while in their care. She said the monitoring and evaluation unit had started to investigate and would contact the family. They requested a post mortem over the alleged head injury due to the fall.Long casualty waiting times is one of the hospital’s key challenges and an improvement team has been studying the cause. A plan will be put in place from next month.
