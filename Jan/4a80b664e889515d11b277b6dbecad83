Now she knows better than me.” She said Latoya died in an ambulance after a paramedic wasted time arguing with her and hit her leg with an oxygen cylinder.“My daughter lost her life because of the negligence of the paramedics. They refused to come into the church,” she said. “When my baby gasped and vomited on the way to hospital, they wiped her mouth and nose and tried to give her oxygen, but it was too late.” Community leader America Makarine said the area needed a proper clinic. Last week Nontombi opened cases of culpable homicide and assault against a paramedic, who also opened an assault case against Mboro. Captain Lesetja Mathobela said an inquest docket was opened and police were waiting for post mortem results. Latoya’s memorial service will be held tomorrow. Nontombi has appealed for financial help to bury her child.
