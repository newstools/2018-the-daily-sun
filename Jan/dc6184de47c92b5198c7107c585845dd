    MALAWIANS are expressing their outrage online at a whole
new low in scamming that happened recently at a local hospital.According to Nyasa
Times, a patient at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe had two visitors
last Sunday. Although the patient didn’t know the visitors, he thought they
were kind friends of his relatives.This impression was strengthened by the fact that the
friendly strangers appeared to have food for the patient. They handed over a
KFC box and bottles of juice.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuoikuVwNIZkvjbLQNRIFo_ry9z3spGFOL4LQ1mtIBRzatpwI8BnGq2cAmGM4YBrBXiXoPAUeHI4aZFBCeoLMf2AP80yQ1viwGg8T79Rn-BHu3cxLphA2s_kO77apmWjBxthmemYIIOMQ0GXQl9SNEpW4yT_Pv8IjP8I8mz-5FDG6B3_At_IA-7I_c0uEkr7hIisaT2fULmDtAXdT-bFU93HnDz0nGVEkSaNksN8gfRjdZkSRBJFgxNdoAzt20su4A_Bq5dqeZLd_Vvl_b8EleFriOyqtdHdfznQA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDjH9i--MkHDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

One of them asked
the patient to use his cellphone. He made the call right there and began
chatting to someone. He then indicated he was going outside to continue his
call. A short while later, his accomplice followed him out of the hospital.While the patient waited for them to return, he and a
hospital guard opened up the food and drink that had been given to the patient.
But instead of tasty treats and juice, there was nothing
but rocks in the KFC box and sand in the juice bottles!That’s when the patient realised he’d been scammed, but
the two conmen had long since disappeared with his cellphone.“Of course there are some patients in our hospitals who
cannot afford decent food and rely on the hospital ration which is not
appealing to most and the thieves must be going around the wards checking on
who seems lacking and take advantage of them like in this situation,” said one
sympathiser on Facebook.“This is really pathetic and heartless, stealing from
hospital patients. That’s sickening,” said another.
