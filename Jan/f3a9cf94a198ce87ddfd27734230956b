WHEN they started their squatter camp last year, residents expected the Red Ants to evict them. However, this never happened and the community leaders recently met to come up with a name for the settlement. Just because they’ve been left in peace, the people of the area in Nellmapius, Tshwane decided to name it after mayor Solly Msimanga! if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuaA5kA6AMp7cmywcaPUSHALYWBwOaNGVLWy5XOysGL1slQeZRWHUu_5fxi5B1UrgxBfAEnUy09TKQXkvqNhlX0XKedEpuhQ5EOCNxDTsacW7dyYxdlWAtjWkzcUCsV-fj_hxnrsi5ledDiyrvjgxBo7QP5VpLMHZKr1V67gLlrAgkR93hmf339wprik07TQdGIQCMJ4j74vb7eCIYutStoWOGfL1VpCxsV2dDs04AzCWdWiBVZcn7UtyIF0RLR2HdbfYPRqlnjwl9SRsMfv1myw6WLUZ8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBqOH2jr7SUpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Mayor Msimanga is a good man and we have seen changes since he took office.”He said they also chose the name because most residents supported the EFF or ANC. “DA members were outnumbered here and we decided to make them feel at home by naming the kasi after a DA leader.” Vickson said although the settlement was named after a political figure, people in the area were tolerant. “We are residents first. We all need water, sanitation and electricity. Politics comes second and everyone here has a right to support any political party,” he said. However resident Maria Mapela (27) said the settlement should not have been named after the mayor.“Msimanga is such an honourable man and this place is corrupt. It should have been named Sodom and Gomorrah. “Women here don’t have it easy. When someone doesn’t like you they will accuse you of sleeping with someone else’s husband and destroy your shack or cut off your water. I don’t think Msimanga would approve of such things.” Mayoral spokesman Samkelo Mgobozi said Msimanga was not aware a kasi had been named after him. “He was surprised. However, we don’t support lawlessness and those people illegally occupied that piece of land.”
