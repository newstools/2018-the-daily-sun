A resident claimed they had not seen any changes in the crime level and arrests were very few.Xolani Zikhali (52), a resident and CPF member, said people wanted government to bring back those vehicles which were stolen and taken into Mozambique.“Locals have been unable to go to work and schools due to the protest.“We really want this matter to be sorted out. We work hard to buy our cars and criminals come here only to rob us,” he said.Another resident, Mthokozisi Ngwane (32), urged the area’s local government to triple its efforts to curb crime.“They must ensure our stolen vehicles are brought back home. If this matter is not given the attention it deserves, people may become very unruly.” Kwanele Ncalane, spokesman for the KZN Department of Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, said MEC Mxolisi Kaunda visited the area earlier yesterday.“The department will issue a full statement once the discussions between the MEC and residents are done,” said Ncalane.The KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “About 1000 community members gathered at the sports ground. They will be addressed by the MEC for Community Safety and Liaison. The residents blockaded the R22 road with their vehicles. A total of nine suspects aged between 29 and 58 were arrested for public violence. They appeared yesterday in the Ingwavuma Magistrates Court. They were granted free bail and the case was remanded to 8 March 2018.”
