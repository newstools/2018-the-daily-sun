Speaking to Daily Sun, Bheki said the Mr Mpumalanga pageant is the second competition he has entered. He said: “I thank God because through Him all things are possible. “I’d also like to thank my family and friends for their support and the organisers for making the event a success.” Bheki said winning the pageant will help him inspire the youth.“I want to encourage the community not to overlook men. When men are protected and raised properly, they learn to respect themselves as well as the opposite sex. That is the only way to create a generation that does away with the men are trash stereotype,” said Bheki.Organiser Billy Brown said: “We would like to thank all our sponsors for their support.“Our plea to Mpumalanga’s public and private sector is to help us take this initiative to the next level. “We cannot do it alone but with your support, a boy child can be saved.”
