available avenues.“We will in the meantime approach the MEC for Cooperative
Governance in the province and the Minister of Public Service and Administration
to look into the matter. “We have also given our legal team all the required
documentation to start a process to have this appointment set aside,” the
statement said.“The unanimous recommendation is that David Sony Tembe is
the most suitable candidate and should be recommended for appointment subject
to him obtaining the necessary security clearance required by the City.“It should be noted that this candidate was the fifth most
suitable based on the interviewing process by the Panel,” the ANC said.The ANC stated that Tembe was the fifth most suitable
candidate based on the interviewing process by the appointed panel.The ANC also said that the Mayor had initially intended to
appoint General Phumzo Gela, but withdrew a report recommending him for further
consideration.“The reason for recommending the fifth candidate is that
this is a crucial position and the City prefers the candidate being able to
take-up the position immediately. “The advantage of this candidate is that he meets the
requirement of being a registered member of the Municipal Police Service. The first four candidates are unfortunately not registered
members of a Municipal Police Service and the process of ensuring that the
necessary training and registration would take months to conclude”, said the
statement.
