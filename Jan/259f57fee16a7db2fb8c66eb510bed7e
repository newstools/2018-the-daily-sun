TAXI drivers have a reputation for behaving like thugs and forcing passengers in their skorokoros to hold on for dear life.On Sunday, taximen in Kagisanong, Mangaung beat a drunk pedestrian who had apparently bumped into a taxi’s side mirror, to a pulp.Residents wanted to know what was happening when they saw an Iveco minibus taxi following three men.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst7Yj0tWuF69OMP1FZY4FoxEiRzew_3pO-C8vSruKIoZd89lh82FZzIjpZILwzaU22Br9MmCoVdZ0aC5BkI9TzNpAtg9rqrN1s8vHh6azjTZTyGvC5tjVz6qKorVRcb_L7or6eNDOI-6ne-25mllvDb5j-a6Z45xp5Xh6gzIEX9L7-dcWwn1RqPQnE90Fb-QWUaHwo53vfMaBormpabLHUw2kRVACtw0Lc2EaJNUUpo3sdNv03bIT487455V551YOP91qrCpxjKvCxx0UeGHKixo--lY4M\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzL0XMl5b9NxLEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But all hell broke loose when his mates arrived. By that time, one of the three men had left and the taximen approached the two remaining men. One managed to run away but his friend was beaten. He was moered until he fell down and then they kicked him. A third taxi driver arrived and stopped his colleagues, fearing angry residents would damage their minibuses.Thapelo Mpine (41) told Daily Sun: “I wouldn’t mess with those taximen. “The mirror wasn’t damaged but their victim’s face and body surely was.”All three drivers left after the incident.The Iveco taxi driver told Daily Sun the men swore at him after one bumped the mirror, but he refused to say more. The beaten man couldn’t say if he would be opening a case.
