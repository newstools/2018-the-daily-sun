For a player of his age who’s also doing well, there’ll always be keen teams in Europe,” said Mosimane.“But you’ve got understand, not all teams in Europe pay better than Sundowns. And as I said, I want Percy to go to one of the top five in Europe and represent us well there. Let’s have a player in the Uefa Champions League from South Africa. We are missing that. “Let’s have the players playing in the group stages like Dino Ndlovu, like when we had Steven Pienaar playing for Ajax Amsterdam and Dortmund, and Benni (McCarthy) at Porto, not Denmark or Sweden. Some teams in Sweden, I believe we can beat them.”Quizzed on last-minute signings, he said: “We are done with signings, unless someone comes with a free clearance. But we don’t have any specific targets.”
