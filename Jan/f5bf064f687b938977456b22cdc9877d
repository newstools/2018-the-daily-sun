Send in your applications. The most qualified will be married on January 6, 2018. Application closes 12 midnight, December 31 2017,” his message read.And as fate would have it, Sophy saw the message and sent in her application.“"Am interested, just DM me...lols," she jokingly responded to him.Sophy told CNN that she took the whole thing as a joke."I never knew he was serious about the post," she said.But, a determined Chidimma was not playing around.“"She likes and comments on my posts from time to time. I was surprised that she replied the message and so it piqued my interest and I immediately messaged her," he told CNN.The couple soon went on their first date and fell in love.Two days later, Chidimma proposed and Sophy said yes.It took four days for them to plan the wedding and meet each other’s families, who were apparently very supportive of the union.The couple got married on the 6th of January 2018 in a traditional ceremony."I am happy that I married him. He is my kind of man," said Sophy.
