tourist, had accompanied her up the stairs at the apartment a few hours before.Vella apparently panicked after she fell, and stole a
motorbike and fled. Cops launched a manhunt and detained him the following
day.Cop Lieutenant Narong Chantra is quoted in the report as
saying: "The police case is that on the day of the incident Mr Vella
visited the bar and paid to take Miss Wannipa away."Miss Wannipa and Mr Vella were having very strange,
extravagant sex on the balcony until she fell down below and died."Mr Vella was in shock and knowing that he had
overstayed his visa ran away and kept her mobile phone in his bag and left the
room."Mr Vella has been arrested on suspicion of negligence
causing others to die, overstaying his visa in excess of 59 days and stealing a
motorcycle at night."The foreign suspect will be processed and
prosecuted in accordance with the law.'"
