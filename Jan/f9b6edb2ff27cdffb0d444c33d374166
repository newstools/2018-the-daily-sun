The WiFi comes and goes at Cape Town Stadium, so we suggest you load some data to tweet about your defeat this evening.”Downs’ social media manager couldn’t take the disrespect from Ajax lying down, and replied: “I wonder if they’ll give you free data in the NFD.”Ajax posted a picture of Mosimane and responded: “Yoh, ku rough. Watch your tone; half your squad comes from Ikamva.”Ikamva is Ajax’s youth academy.Downs posted a picture of Ajax coach Muhsin Ertugral with the caption: “Start dreaming a little, gents. We bought those players, financed Ikamva and conquered Africa. We don’t borrow players.”Ajax’s admin fired back: “Hawu, stop lying to your followers #FormerAfricanChamps. Also, Ikamva was built before that yellow prison in Chloorkop.”Fans from both teams jumped into the conversation and tried in vain to reprimand the administrators.
