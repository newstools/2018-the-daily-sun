    Â A family representative of a woman and her three children, whose bodies were found in a submerged vehicle in the Sterkfontein Dam, said the woman had been having marital problems. On January 6, a Toyota Tazz containing the bodies of Portia Mkhize, 35, and her three sons Kgotso,13, Nyakallo, 8, and Bokang, 5, was discovered by private divers at a resort in the Free State. A separate case of arson has led members of the family to believe that Portia was struggling with marital issues. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuw-RR-ANghZy5bXi2VnZKICiR71v0jep5bMpe48NPCjFvMezyO7-D8gZJPoZ18wK2jQ925XM_NUtdNu6yRw0hEn_LeBZbC5DwIH7dqDyGmGbhrONuDQOwXACxoNGya44hvLEpq-Z9ysAcDeGA_TiT_YKlfOGcTxzq-g-xwL8KmMonfQDJNRHhtjibEKRRurrUSxhu5Ao55VsWEy2NJ1XrYv-kBdMW9S0H8lNlU_IGNR10dlL5KgOfPvsDAZyRr2bws8n3vzNEbSm0NkGxlKzLl0iwPSZI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzD_QkJwUvD3eEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
