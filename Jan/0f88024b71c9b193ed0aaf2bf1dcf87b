    Â A family representative of a woman and her three children, whose bodies were found in a submerged vehicle in the Sterkfontein Dam, said the woman had been having marital problems. On January 6, a Toyota Tazz containing the bodies of Portia Mkhize, 35, and her three sons Kgotso,13, Nyakallo, 8, and Bokang, 5, was discovered by private divers at a resort in the Free State. A separate case of arson has led members of the family to believe that Portia was struggling with marital issues. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst_Mr-sFDDDpaRDf7S3JFQemmMyY1GzepKkvHLi4aWNk1Gx_MT2PI5X_FiTfnmLhSWqxzb3Zv99O-iWH8j0syX1AgNBxOzsGD__V_um4BuoSPALXe5MrueDc6aLwhwOeaFqkdWKn9_nE48p3NkTSAkHtp7bzM_90nuT-5hv_cpqy1HeuBcrwJM1GikjLjOGR99DXqP441RWie7PUBK6R39GekM5PmrHW3LkbEjTOnUmRL92Z53yGXzGZhhtaPdPILaOvY1Z2UAnQ4xOGxANZ1X0qO7s3tA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOJWoJSDTKkYEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
