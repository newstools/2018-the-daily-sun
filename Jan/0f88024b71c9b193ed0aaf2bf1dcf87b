    Â A family representative of a woman and her three children, whose bodies were found in a submerged vehicle in the Sterkfontein Dam, said the woman had been having marital problems. On January 6, a Toyota Tazz containing the bodies of Portia Mkhize, 35, and her three sons Kgotso,13, Nyakallo, 8, and Bokang, 5, was discovered by private divers at a resort in the Free State. A separate case of arson has led members of the family to believe that Portia was struggling with marital issues. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuZlomKXfCQcfKw85T6L_0TpBopV9Lq2LBjQ1zoDWN4xcp9B8SbttDLyCkn3hDcCfp8XYExRDnXilrSVhxFEtLdy-Ho7lOsMilP_czKbHkIbijMc1qo-QQii0O7OxLkvPsSGXZP-mbk3aUr3mYauR28YphLXCh2FX5ZuZpcLECyCMCaKLgyvyR2L9i1BgXNS5KaAbYnzDPJP8R7jdnrO9PRpIZbqOSX3u1-0aq6GcR7MN38b1K6UU9Fx4oqmyAt62Cj04NhQLJGymb0wpeGekWIrWiTTJA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzF_gH2PknEQdEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
