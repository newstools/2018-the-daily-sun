    Â A family representative of a woman and her three children, whose bodies were found in a submerged vehicle in the Sterkfontein Dam, said the woman had been having marital problems. On January 6, a Toyota Tazz containing the bodies of Portia Mkhize, 35, and her three sons Kgotso,13, Nyakallo, 8, and Bokang, 5, was discovered by private divers at a resort in the Free State. A separate case of arson has led members of the family to believe that Portia was struggling with marital issues. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstqrUcV0hliFytjz9i_urXD604B1z4oeweXSSy8jVtQJ1w_Gt4gKRMIvjVAcHnLZBromCgVpVXfyzBj7jID00ekSP3WXwiF0Zp_Gvl0irTqxjrQ140_8rsmdo05c8E7dW3V0SmKPAFwGYkNaYidGZtJSJNArjIFelrBHDwLFQIa9Vt4F61Asjq92qOib3Pk-aeYswmWngZzyO8okK1lknrzpJW1CrV0gt9_gpMG_aMUR-i7H2wtfCPtztG-Xv5lIH5trKM390FY-_rgNyh49XSjSOh697U\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGCBrc2zzVh8EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
