    Â A family representative of a woman and her three children, whose bodies were found in a submerged vehicle in the Sterkfontein Dam, said the woman had been having marital problems. On January 6, a Toyota Tazz containing the bodies of Portia Mkhize, 35, and her three sons Kgotso,13, Nyakallo, 8, and Bokang, 5, was discovered by private divers at a resort in the Free State. A separate case of arson has led members of the family to believe that Portia was struggling with marital issues. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu0fNO17eoBr2iHcn7BADpHUppCYo-mYe0WD249MnIBrsml-sMk-oah-R-2xhfqvUe7czuVHY9_4HCUSNKSZJXjZ7sOIirQejOpd6kVSlCGs7h4yJFe5_TWBF1skkjn2jYvF2bsXTuopTsUl1QlHrVsFN2-T2i-r5gKcdNLqzpavf5cYGFZmiN_vVswFhf6YZPTn47PklygoMncGI7_GfQZ_kKu5-DgRQ_wuAz0YLtre-ginOgW-NmWHQ6BI5sBdXe7pa7I7vshqMTUGPZEDlKb6HMJ0KM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzF2OifSfR97MEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
