    Â A family representative of a woman and her three children, whose bodies were found in a submerged vehicle in the Sterkfontein Dam, said the woman had been having marital problems. On January 6, a Toyota Tazz containing the bodies of Portia Mkhize, 35, and her three sons Kgotso,13, Nyakallo, 8, and Bokang, 5, was discovered by private divers at a resort in the Free State. A separate case of arson has led members of the family to believe that Portia was struggling with marital issues. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuPuPaeSrUzEYnGmcuFYaqVJtHCOyo76UCJz-QmVfAlk0qg5RQxASwRaW7Bh5nsKUr2TH-ZNFlrIiRcWHFaZ95NDHWbMKXgfjS4eNO5AX3bepcu51X6YhTowDBzWMbecOIJ4e4Iw4tdIWS16Y7JnMmBTTRwqVjIj2D9RddiD_WJiTNbgMdVkt6OLXgVmsHiv5qOq1Knqzg7CfOCeU5g7_NL9DpnBONGlwvZRz5p4xajcNP64TGtcZJ7yuT4CAnx7tJILVKgaGZbew05360Q33_RmUiYSQk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKVTCxmmaF1cEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
