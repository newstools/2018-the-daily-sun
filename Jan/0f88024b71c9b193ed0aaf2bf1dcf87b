    Â A family representative of a woman and her three children, whose bodies were found in a submerged vehicle in the Sterkfontein Dam, said the woman had been having marital problems. On January 6, a Toyota Tazz containing the bodies of Portia Mkhize, 35, and her three sons Kgotso,13, Nyakallo, 8, and Bokang, 5, was discovered by private divers at a resort in the Free State. A separate case of arson has led members of the family to believe that Portia was struggling with marital issues. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstfwjluVBlQPcHwuYEhu5BazKktRVjfheSKrc4TJNXmBp9Y9yOq8E-A2adDhQBqgmd3Uq0jIVzzBAKbmePRMWwb0_3OQoHOMFLujWFF6OdaVsJCxHr1e4Ro1hmE3Yt-l0vqs8YwKZnZnzDCq9-k26lNmcKQSItTAtu5gtnma1xnoexeugdHGwEBSWYFooddKRmu7brKQ7tO9RIOyl4U4t0OLfa8zNdw03VbZdzgJ0gF8fg9ezlSkKjJS2owgPjiaVf08sb--fgggjsmwV2-oa_u6-RFlVo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNDbwrrrh0MPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
