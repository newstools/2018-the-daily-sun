    Â A family representative of a woman and her three children, whose bodies were found in a submerged vehicle in the Sterkfontein Dam, said the woman had been having marital problems. On January 6, a Toyota Tazz containing the bodies of Portia Mkhize, 35, and her three sons Kgotso,13, Nyakallo, 8, and Bokang, 5, was discovered by private divers at a resort in the Free State. A separate case of arson has led members of the family to believe that Portia was struggling with marital issues. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvgl6GkfOGueauU_418KDJDKMr1-sLh4Pg8OeYXB4l1soRV2T-5ikwiD9PpG-E1oLkMdg98SVLtkr9GWGhvxudiEa5FZtNz8m6i4XaYdd1lUWWSP7hFvaMHbzX-lCH0gpgUcIlyjBzwyUp-UNvb9DJ10RKbPSC3wcpBw-Vz3TPGhAg24TGwDPWusAaK-fC7CK0aqPn1cMBM2inbGdZZ3xkjRcNiiRlgzhY_SbgqIY2ePsRHbnkd4pW6rviLbgLDeoNipqY2GI7i78gQo0Uv4b7pLd76Ll4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMXtX1DClgRDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
