He closed my mouth with his hands and demanded money.” The gogo said she had no money and an argument broke out.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssVrBVQu9FtRx6Z3x0iullrUj0diPtGRi0kkAnhHm5FXvea1lL7XRFftipR44RoyYapiecT_K9LCUtrDvCU3e8PNSVPKhTk7tnk2bsGLuFdSwSAsGmKxYQa3w1TgvspBN0aMqM7lsZ5bCv-mTez4_6GzYpwZaVKGJdzzz_J_Knn03WWWXC0DaE9olAEsITTHMNWqYMff98Gum0RHZIBQtpKsne_QemoE3xHCTVs_49g9P5dqxwIUEpXdp_wTWMjBlz0MvdflGu1jnTm6f3vxHC20XTq9Yc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCVpjKTvQQvEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I thank God for giving me the power to take the knife from him. “I would have cut off his penis if he hadn’t run away,” she said. Thobeka Festile said: “As residents, we will not tolerate seeing elderly people being raped. “We will work with the cops to hunt down the rapist.”The gogo’s brother said: “I heard my sister crying after the thug had fled. “I saw him running towards his friend who was waiting across the street.”Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said: “I can confirm that the family violence and sexual offences unit is investigating a case of rape. No one has been arrested.”
