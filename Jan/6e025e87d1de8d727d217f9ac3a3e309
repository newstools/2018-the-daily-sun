    AN EVIL thug sneaked into gogo’s house through the back door in the early hours of New Year’s Day and allegedly raped her. The traumatised gogo (69) from Gunguluza, near New Brighton, Eastern Cape told Daily Sun: “I heard a strange sound and before I knew what was happening, I saw a man standing next to me with a knife in his hand. He closed my mouth with his hands and demanded money.” The gogo said she had no money and an argument broke out.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuJdSBeHAsoPgJlznAvKJmiRGS6W6e4dMQYvSgMXzeVcA7J0OQBvkv1eo5EdWWgSm5xYa3vYrXheCTf4KN0S98foqHeYWTAqe8eGR2A0n4IQ9artapnGgZitDsOS2WEX3xrB_GHqCN2yaNqWE3Ld-DqMH9Or3EfkZNcmJFGJ7V9lxLKeBiMBu0h_BK-rXqW0juhYTwEcMb0eobkan8f2qay1WmeiV8m_neVu33FUknVrj1GMZJgIIqR3v_2YBOAUjvIIm-mTWpr3M0j_LpEadd2FeQrZ2I\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNH1VysmHfJOEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I thank God for giving me the power to take the knife from him. “I would have cut off his penis if he hadn’t run away,” she said. Thobeka Festile said: “As residents, we will not tolerate seeing elderly people being raped. “We will work with the cops to hunt down the rapist.”The gogo’s brother said: “I heard my sister crying after the thug had fled. “I saw him running towards his friend who was waiting across the street.”Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said: “I can confirm that the family violence and sexual offences unit is investigating a case of rape. No one has been arrested.”
