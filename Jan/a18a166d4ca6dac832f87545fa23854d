We know we’re going to see results soon.”The pastor said the thugs gained entry into the church on Saturday night through a broken window.“They stole three brand new speakers, two microphones, an amplifier and cords. The equipment was worth close to R15 000,” she said.When church members arrived for the Sunday service, they found the church had been ransacked.“They left damaged speakers behind. It seems they had planned to take  everything, but we suspect their car was too small,” said Masuku.A case of theft was opened at the De Deur Police Station and cops are looking for the suspects.“We found some of the things packed next to the door. We feel so disappointed that people don’t fear God and his property any more.” She said they opened a case of theft but they were pinning their hopes on God to deal with the thugs. “We know our God doesn’t disappoint. The hand that stole from us is definitely going to suffer. We told ourselves this is God’s war and he will fight it,” she said. “If I was one of the thugs I would spare myself heavenly torture and surrender the goods.”
