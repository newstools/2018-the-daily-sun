COPS may not be able to catch them, but the church members believe their God will.They pray day and night for evil to descend on the thugs who broke into their church over the weekend and stole almost all their music equipment. They believe the Holy Spirit will burn the thugs one by one. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Pastor Betty Masuku of Victory Fellowship Centre at Lakeside in the Vaal told Daily Sun: “They must either bring back the instruments or face the consequences.”Masuku said church members pray daily at 6am, 9am, 12pm, 3pm, 10pm, 12am and 3am for justice to prevail.She told the People’s Paper: “We pray every day and the Holy Spirit will definitely hear us. We know we’re going to see results soon.”The pastor said the thugs gained entry into the church on Saturday night through a broken window.“They stole three brand new speakers, two microphones, an amplifier and cords. The equipment was worth close to R15 000,” she said.When church members arrived for the Sunday service, they found the church had been ransacked.“They left damaged speakers behind. It seems they had planned to take  everything, but we suspect their car was too small,” said Masuku.A case of theft was opened at the De Deur Police Station and cops are looking for the suspects.“We found some of the things packed next to the door. We feel so disappointed that people don’t fear God and his property any more.” She said they opened a case of theft but they were pinning their hopes on God to deal with the thugs. “We know our God doesn’t disappoint. The hand that stole from us is definitely going to suffer. We told ourselves this is God’s war and he will fight it,” she said. “If I was one of the thugs I would spare myself heavenly torture and surrender the goods.”
