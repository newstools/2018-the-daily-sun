RAMAHLWE “Rama” Mphahlele could be set for a surprise return to the Kaizer Chiefs lineup to face his former club Mamelodi Sundowns in their weekend showdown.Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela hinted the fit-again Mphahlele could make an injury comeback in the crunch Absa Premiership clash at FNB Stadium on Saturday. The Bafana Bafana full-back has not featured for Chiefs since the 2-0 win at Cape Town City FC in September but has been an unused substitute in the last three matches.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssEZUUDaClrargEKCwUMSQtyWdHhwU--rPEeTF65HPV-SKKIcCvKRA7ThpAJZ2aHMZJJiFotwP9pCYYCFbKyqU1Gg_Y5NkWm2rPDu5YT_owzfyNBhatqfWoo-oCYyF6grPBkOdg4ELOejxoOeIjHqYuN1d12gZxPZsvG3BblLUdhhfiBGkHM-ayiAOKrR1_-tLxRKtnvQHtHLLLXFbs0Rpkr6i8qEiFBcOUYn4nGHwYeDIowP7_hUP1TGfv-jqp9SE2kAi7ZDBYiFmuBssS8Ciz2g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBqk3ejnbOqXEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Who knows?“We don’t want to tell Sundowns who’s going to be on the team sheet next week – but there’s a possibility. We still have (Kgotso) Moleko, (Bhongolethu) Jayiya who can play out wide. “But Mphahlele is a top professional. It’s a pity he got injured – before he got injured he was on song.”There will be plenty of attacking options for Komphela, new signings Siphelele Ntshangase and Leonardo Castro already demonstrating their ambition.Castro scored the winner against Baroka FC on debut and, fitness permitting, the Colombian could start against his former employers.Komphela admitted their goal conversion rate could improve, adding that the experience of previous matches provides confidence ahead of the big clash.“It’s that time of the year when every point counts,” he said.“It’s a five-point gap. It’s game on, showtime all the way. There are 12 matches to go. “It’s important to keep within touching distance of the leaders. This makes for an interesting match. It’s a direct confrontation. And everybody has a desire to win.”The teams have faced each other in 65 league encounters since the start of the National Soccer League 33 years ago, Amakhosi winning 27, the Brazilians recording 20 victories and 18 games ending in draws.But Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane certainly wouldn’t want to lose to the Soweto giants twice in a season.
