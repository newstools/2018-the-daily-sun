this natural cycle. By showing this publicly, I think it shows that it's
actually ok to feel connected to it."Honouring all of oneself is where true power lies,
so when you start to realise it's not so taboo, that's when you experience what
life is about."This is about reclaiming that power. It's about
connecting with your whole being and exploring all of ourselves."The blood is an honouring of that. It's a very
creative energy, but it's also a life-force. If we didn't bleed, there would be
no life!"
