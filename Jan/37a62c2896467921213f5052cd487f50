member of the public reportedly came forward with information on where part of
the stolen fence was being kept and by whom. The sting
operation led to a block of flats in Eldorado Park where the stolen fence was
recovered. The owner
of the property was not home when the team arrived.The fence
had formed part of a series of upgrades to the Soweto Country Club.It has been
reported that the thugs have been cutting the fence piece by piece since
December last year.“The
project has already seen the building of a new club house‚ a new practice
facility‚ a conference centre‚ and a fence constructed along two boundaries of
the golf course itself.,” City of Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba said.The
existing storage facility at the Soweto Country Club will be turned into a
fully operational pro-shop and a South African Golf Development Board Academy‚
named after Rivonia Trialist‚ apartheid activist and avid golfer‚ Andrew
Mlangeni., Mashaba said.“It saddens
me to learn that the matter was reported to the police in the area but no
action was immediately taken.“I then
roped in a team from GFIS to investigate the matter and ensure that the
perpetrators were put behind bars,” the Mayor said.
