There must be records. We must be told what actually happened and who is going to be held accountable.”Cindy said the families were shown a file at the Elukwatini Police Station which indicates that a case of reckless driving was opened. But the file was empty. “Reckless driving for what? Who was reckless and how did they engage in that reckless conduct and who’s making the allegation?” However police said they have now collected nine witness statements and are trying to locate two more witnesses. They denied claims that the driver was drunk at the time of the accident.“Our information is that he doesn’t drink at all,” said provincial police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi. Hlathi refused to give any more details about the accident. “The victims are still in a critical condition. We’ll get statements from them as soon as their condition improves.”
