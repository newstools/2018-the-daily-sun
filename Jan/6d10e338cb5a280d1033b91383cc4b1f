Lebohang did his training at Jema Skating in Randburg but before that he skated for fun in his neighbourhood. “These days, I’m a skating coach for over 20 members of the Kathorus Skating Club,” he said. On top of skating, Lebohang is a percussionist, artist and dancer. He has travelled Africa playing drums and in Swaziland he earned the nickname Inyanga because people said he was the healer of their souls. Speaking about his art, he said he did engraving and drawings on tiles. “This is the art form I will stay with forever,” he said. Lebohang’s dancing focuses on the traditional Tswana style of Setapa. “I won the award for best male traditional dancer at the Sekunjalo Theatre Arts and Cultural Marathon Festival in 2011,” he said.
