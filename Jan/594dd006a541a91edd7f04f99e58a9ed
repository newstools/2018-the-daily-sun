    Not even labour could stop this American student from completing her finals. Nayzia Thomas, from Missouri, US, recently went viral on Twitterafter posting a photo of herself completing her final exam while in labour.  Her mom quickly snapped a picture of her typing away on her laptop while preparing to give birth to her son, Anthony Johnson.“My mom took this pic and it's the perfect explanation of my life,” she wrote. “Yes I’m about to have a baby, but final SZN ain't over yet.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstgtld6ohRjf3YtU9IJKCvgmDDDHdps0ukBom7GXozbayV8P6bWSJW0n-zZ1b3dzRdLJ5RwEYgMiI9-Wy8yZq_A3-gi7aje6z621lHk2VRl2dMAKpFDGoJIMPjfxmrGsuVWKO4e5H-q0bZdhKcPSAZxTzKMzt4fmvcXmCiJ8b4T8rw7nulM-LktmQZ-9LJ0YJu2Lq35hySzP4sUQ4dlvBskR1Kuu1V9Yzr431zy1cjKrx7MUuDe7XV0F53-8-jNoZTQpXI_YaA2j7yQWbZnLYjYdUmgexM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJZjRwSHHkgyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
