WHO is fooling who? Will it be Kaizer Chiefs or Mamelodi Sundowns? Both teams are playing mind games ahead of the weekend’s biggest Absa Premiership showdown. The Tshwane giants have bestowed the favourites tag on Amakhosi ahead of their top-of-the-table Premiership encounter at FNB Stadium on Saturday (8.15pm). if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss6kZO0-726zSeu5EqpcXnKcqIV5ESsy_FwEEjNtirnHKV0v7WJSmecDXdNOC0FHjAnj60WLxX5JAtZZJA_fCznUvSbYp9dHA4CRsVKlRNsx__Z3sGwylrheG2Qne4jhfStdp69vY8J-LCdOOFyKs7ofRA6GnSiiXqr1wDxUiwbgTN_IFNfRbgi58gkLPJKTaIBMFF1A_kIG6H4UEFxE5-nKK0av5x6b3uTT5_MPskuAqV_xb_-ArNpXmOi24mvgR-f6ToQuRmv9Kbbox5Ulql3yw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKUPdRrB8MUsEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Sundowns skipper Hlompho Kekana disagrees, as he strongly believes Amakhosi go into the game as the most consistent team in the league, looking at the past couple of match results. Chiefs have recorded back-to-back victories in the teams’ last two encounters and will complete the hat-trick if they get one over on the former African champions this weekend. The Brazilians lead the table with 34 points, just five points ahead of Amakhosi with 18 games played. If Amakhosi claim victory again they will cut that gap down to two points. The pick of the weekend’s matches will also see Chiefs’ new recruit Leonardo Castro face his former team for the first time since his January transfer. Former Downs skipper Ramahlwe Mphahlele is also poised to make his eagerly awaited return from injury against his former team. Kekana said: “We will be cautious against Chiefs. They beat us in the last two games. We won’t try to be smart and attempt to outplay them, they have the potential to hurt us. “We are scared of Chiefs, we will adopt a cautious approach. We go into the game as the underdogs. “We are aware of the threat they pose – we can’t be naive and open up, knowing what happened in the last two encounters between us.” Kekana missed the 3-0 victory over Platinum Stars due to injury, but says he is fully fit to face Amakhosi. Khune, on the other hand, rejects the idea that the Brazilians are the underdogs. He said: “We have to narrow the gap to two points. Coach Pitso Mosimane says he is scared of Chiefs but it’s mind games. “We’d be foolish to believe they think that way. We are preparing for a great Sundowns with quality and don’t entertain such talk.” Khune underlined the importance of preventing the Brazilians from pulling away from the rest of the chasing pack. He added: “We won’t allow them to open up a big gap at the top.”
