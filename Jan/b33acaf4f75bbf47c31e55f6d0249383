The girl told her rescuers she spotted a cop in uniform there, saying he came to collect money from one of the drug dealers. This sparked outrage and six guest houses were set alight in the CBD. Three cellphones were destroyed when people used them to take pictures and Daily Sun photographer Rapula Mancai was told to put his camera away.The mum claimed her daughter was forced into drugs and prostitution. She said cops’ failure to help her in the past when she wanted to report a drug den proved they work with drug dealers. “I was given the runaround,” she said.“I went there four times, and each time I was told they would get back to me but they never did.” Two foreigners, a local man believed to be a cop, and a woman were found at another house. Commissioner Baile Motswenyane said a suspect was bust on Wednesday for the rape of the 17-year-old. A cop was bust for possession of drugs.
