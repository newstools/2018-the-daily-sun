WITH the #MeToo and #womensmarch movements sweeping much
of the globe, the hubby of a plus size model decided to make his own statement
about the natural beauty of all women.Nick Holliday posted the naked photo of his wife, Tess
Holliday (32), during the Women’s March that happened in countries like America
last Sunday.Next to it Nick wrote: “Women deserve respect, whether
they are completely naked or covered head to toe.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuxOSrcBtOEd-KnpLkHqZx436dhRNCb0UG5hj581v9qtEcJhK9G9Ndi60Nlf04NinFODLSXHzuMAi3XqHwULZHPEzxaqN_MHTmB7IeI1u1TmZETta1TRZMaHCsy0diACNRiWNeXsyNm75N2CuQs_qvspCFs-2Ds4H2z8Szjh3sjwxAefEQcSIoeabwCg2h90qZyYuM-O0e0kAXd65ra5fY2FITbbmXXrLFpu8uV7bYHlkMr7g0E_HmrLjkaCPnsVEI28fGwTW8-rKdFnJklfbui1_98uNzGzW5N8g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPEZP1t-sUldEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

a few weeks ago to post today. No alterations to her body or bare face have
been made.“#effyourbeautystandards #nomakeup #unretouched
#womensmarch”While some comments were extremely vicious towards Tess’
figure, most were supportive.Tess later reposted it on her Instagram account as well.According to The
Sun, the couple met on Tumblr. They spoke online for seven months before
meeting face-to-face. They married in 2015, and Nick moved from Australia to America
where they live.
