Jobodwana said: “Yeah, Bolt is a cool guy. I had a cool time with him. Everybody is excited about him coming to Mzansi. Running against him remains one of my greatest highlights. His presence will boost SA athletes and motivate the young ones. He is that one guy that has managed to cool me down and issued a lot of advice. We talked a lot and running against him was exciting.” Jobodwana did not make the IAAF world championships in London last year due to injury, but he is eager to make his comeback on the international stage. Jobodwana said: “Everything has been going well so far. I’m training and picking up slowly. I’m trying to get back on the world stage. I have no injury  and no niggles and that makes it possible for me to be at the top of my game again. I just have to up my level.” Races will be coming in thick and fast in the new season. Starting with the Grand Prix series on 1 March at Ruimsig, followed by the SA Senior championships and the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast in Australia, but the Eastern Cape born runner is happy to take on the challenge. The 25-year-old added: “It’s going to be an interesting challenge that will need me to bring my A game. I just need to work on a few things and I will be good to go.”
