bodies off the mountain, using the cable car," said Wilderness Search and
Rescue (WSAR) spokesman Johann Marais."We were able to extract the surviving female off
the mountain last night, making use of the cable car as a rigging point from
which to abseil."if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst8FJQ0i1OzqIUWOH-wA_Jb0RLRrMREvrTh0bGFJPmdts6VTTOb2MzUBu9bu1pp7bh9xser096TEIMbz6OnfFunslz-wapSNY7PWh66vfFqByAZdA8wNYtznzcD8qXxP2UU1g25X-5hs6Hz7c33JGKjy0V0Ra4XCzyVKtvgyaldhm4orgSOv333Xtd7sSpPNu3Ri9Mr-TbO4-i6cVfYkLHoKqquclQIhNxddTkEzz0epX3aeAfIrNR3-7L1imRnBsrcd9H7cMhPgqMazrXvi7pW2Icyw-A\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJ7PE0Gf5g--EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

straight to hospital for treatment. The extent of her injuries was not yet known.Marais said that after rescuing the female survivor, the
cable car was then put back into use to bring down the approximately 800
tourists who had been left stranded on the mountain during the rescue
operation.The cable car company sent people up the mountain, on
foot, to reopen the restaurant, where those stranded could wait and receive
refreshments.Everyone was brought back to the base by 2am and the
cable car was then used to extricate the bodies.He said the exact circumstances of the accident, which
took place on Monday afternoon, were not yet clear."They were abseiling and were each tied to the rope
and all three of them fell the (full) length of the safety rope…There was no
more rope."  http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/bodies-of-tourist-guide-retrieved-after-table-mountain-accident-20180102
