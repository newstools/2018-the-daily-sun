I told him I was Jerry, and he said, ‘Why are you f***ing the dogs?’“I asked him why he was accusing me of this.” Jerry and the unknown man got into a heated argument.“He said blacks poke dogs and became aggressive. I said my job was to rehabilitate people and animals, and since I could see he had a problem, I wouldn’t mind rehabilitating him too.”The racist caller then told Jerry he didn’t accept help from k******s, and allegedly told him: “I want you guys to leave my planet now.”“I then hung up,” Jerry said.But it didn’t end there. The man started sending Jerry SMSes. Jerry said that the incident left him shaken. “I’m a proud father of three children and I am married so there’s no need for me to poke dogs,” he said. “I help people from all races and backgrounds, it doesn’t matter. I was shocked when this happened.” He added that he now also feared for his life. “I don’t even know this person, yet he attacked me.”Police spokesman Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng said a case of intimidation was opened against the caller.
