A CLINIC in the Philippines caused a stir last week when
it was profiled on TV for its punani whitening procedure.According to Coconuts,
the procedure is known as “angel whitening” and is offered at the Belo Clinic in
Manila, Philippines. The clinic is the brainchild of Vicky Belo (61), a local
celebrity dermatologist.Using laser technology, the procedure promises to “whiten,
tighten, relax and clean” the punani, said the TV feature.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssiwsY_dmoI2Z25gr0F9D8xYiiItK6x5R0WAIZ5608uB1BRhhmBJu0wGxJ3Cua8UEiUWVYJUza9dCtlwQWcBjiwjSLaZ4UiuH5-K0dcoaXNTydFWkfV2WARdlSjpsgEuW5VNESvC1gKJNkzveA8hGpF24gzDeWoA_7oHZpCriJDzL2vOyjSgsBTFM4wOXc3uEN-AxJQ2Vc3fZGvD97hj-n2zZTe2rokV_qx5WeAItKuj0JyU2AEreuCCro43xjmK-eReuBjzYyLUJRde6jzcWBIo9eSEI_675P7Fg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzI3WxNswTX9kEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

costs PHP50 000 (about R11 800).Dr Givency Ang, a cosmetic surgeon who works at the
clinic, is quoted in the report as saying: “This whitens and cleans the vagina
of the woman.”Belo Clinic also offers another punani improvement
procedure called Femilift. According to the Philippine
Daily Inquirer, that procedure takes about 10 minutes and tightens the
vagina so that women “feel like virgins again.”Being "fair-skinned" is prized
in the Philippines, as it is in many other Asian cultures.
