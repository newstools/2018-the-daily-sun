    A 17-year-old girl was lucky to escape with her life
after allegedly stealing a cop patrol car and then smashing it through a fence
and into a parked car.According to New
Zealand Herald, the unnamed teen was picked up by cops in the early hours
of Wednesday morning in Pukehangi, Rotorua in northern New Zealand. She and a
man with her had apparently been spotted “acting suspiciously”.Cops wanted to give the couple a lift home and put the
girl in the car, but the man refused to get in. As cops were trying to deal
with him, the girl jumped into the driver’s seat and fled.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstdX3T3LAid5wadF4LMkMJsO7zwoN5iTLRXEinmUL1WHsIV00pvjeOBeX8nHoUfmOtjd6pRZ-sY9bLg7QY2JbIEw8DSAEkisMYXmn5Ww6Y6VkGLF7LXkpyZIZFnQv_cJ2hHyGrU-DYNxk9tiYCL6VMQL3rwaF-q_SFI7aFVsoEuzaE16Ss8NNPIo_5hNPfy6du-TP0IBbdNER-OoT2ALVE6B3vKjI3V_sXIQBY5c5XYfg-D9idXgBWII8uT884TcSHSLWnvcTyzEeVosWNjLC1RnopvN-V3xe9Dcw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHgAn_QZMxulEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
