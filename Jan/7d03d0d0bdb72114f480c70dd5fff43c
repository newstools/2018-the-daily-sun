The fatalities include 21 pedestrians, 13 passengers, seven drivers, two motor-bikers and a single cyclist."The pedestrians killed included two seven-year-old boys and an eight-year-old girl. Nine of the 21 pedestrians killed lost their lives on the freeways. Three on the N3, three on the N12 and three on R21," said Kgasago.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvSDcG6suCL79J3FJ-lQEQWRrRVWXl0w3EiP48JufneZAKQM9VzKvXvCn40TNU-zdPdFbqc8zfK7yhEfLjVgVuOzbjrh2-_JXvyRp_F5g-dEsTcxeq_XyI4mEhdsCm7k2euZYnC5v-5NClXogl6DklsWA5BC3gIbs3JzN1ChXWqmQes7OlPVBMIICdeRqAUhgUpwPTQI3loIVJ09ugXaSrOdt0dKSqG_9Ngf0tvqE6Dh3lfXJJ0tCnb9BvoRX_hWSbgaN1nC5CjfwNc6xA6IadLEZkAOWs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA6eVAvHFMF5EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
