She said her two kids told her their classrooms still didn’t have roofs and they had to squat in other classes as there was not enough space for them.“We don’t understand what is causing the delay. If nothing happens soon we will take action because in this country you must fight if you want to be attended to.” Sihle Mlotshwa, the provincial department spokesman, said they hadn’t forgotten about the damage to Entuthukweni and promised the school would be fixed soon. He said that many schools had been damaged in last year’s storm and that Entuthukweni was next in line for repairs.
