The demands include the return of the death penalty and the banning of abortion.A senior police officer told Daily Sun they didn’t know about the march.Zweli Ndlovu, provincial chairman of Umbimbi Lwamabutho, said they were not marching but walking to the city hall to meet the president. He said there was no need to inform the police because amabutho are disciplined. President Zuma said: “I will take up your demands with the relevant institutions, including parliament.”
