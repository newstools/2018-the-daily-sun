AJAX Cape Town FC head coach Muhsin Ertugral has warned his players to be cautious when they host his former club Orlando Pirates in an Absa Premiership clash at Cape Town Stadium on Wednesday night (7.30pm). Ertugral resigned as Pirates coach after five months at the helm. The 58-year-old couldn’t take the humiliation of losing 6-1 to SuperSport United in a league clash at Mbombela Stadium last season, deciding on the spot that the right thing to do was to resign.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssOO1bcH_qqoH2hCsmEVuhBzcKio90cqR-tnAqJDqIcM9OrRxY-lgcZj4IvGlQc9YN7cNWxXTZnwobRuqEabYe8Cl6pZhX51cXrUMLAu9ZtSxe9Dca5wmOXUYV3pSOP6rMUAf_0HSfXIAQw9YWAGjqeeVI8xzzDL93-5bjRw2pep8NhQ0LzTZTzGvnFUMS1mulj_kpTxkiuha2pzO_kBL-7ZKMySJDgQ5Szo-wri_huekh9IV5HkIvyprPmae32D9ekG2wItXRkEyF7xhbeIePHqg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPLKE1zbc0EMEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Pirates are a big team and are doing well,” he said. “This kind of match makes our job as coaches easy. It’s motivating for the players on its own. Everyone is motivated for this clash and looking forward to the game. “It will be a tough match but we have to fight for three points and move away from the relegation zone. I am hoping for a good game and that we will win.” Ertugral is optimistic that they will survive relegation.“My focus is on helping Ajax move away from the position they are in, nothing else counts at the moment,” he said yesterday. “It’s not a good position we’re in but I am confident that we will move away from it.” The former Kaizer Chiefs coach warned his players to be vigilant against Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic’s Buccaneers. “Pirates are a quality team and have individual players who are very good,” he said. “We have to be extra careful and fully focused. But we will be ready for them. To us all the games are very important, we have to fight for three points.” Ajax are currently second from bottom in the table with 17 points from 19 games.They are only two points ahead of bottom side Platinum Stars.Ertugral will rely on the new signings from Mamelodi Sundowns, Yannick Zakri and Siyanda Zwane, to stop the Soweto giants. But to achieve that, the Ajax defence needs to be strong enough to stop Pirates’ star players Justin Shonga, Luvuyo Memela and Thembinkosi Lorch. The coach will have to make do without the services of John Takwara.A win for Bucs will see them take over second spot with 33 points from 20 matches. That would put them only two points behind leaders Sundowns.
