Overvaal claimed victory yesterday against the Gauteng Department of Education
at the Gauteng High Court.The
North Gauteng High Court yesterday ruled that the school's application to halt
the department from admitting 55 English-speaking learners into its school
would be heard in an urgent court. Judge
Bill Prinsloo discovered that the department failed to convince the court that
the application lacked urgency.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvpnbhhIMmKmm4sIsIGPwxhcPQE1WjaXQoaKJ_TSpYnznGE_pKK1tGCDWX6Qanlv8Y1RiMCMNmZT_qTlWLyTGW_q2zeZIEM4cJsgvHGYh_h8FL5fsS2NiSRsFUN-ktjAQHXLano9ZzOiWMBxpOM3PQrQwq7ehjN33JsTKSM2HseeSTONcRwLR6zKk9fL6u68lq3bWZ1A3gq8XBWqa5GKvU5cfxn9lVgi1WdiFo5yrndzowB1JwAQbktb6EyHezVH_0zTORG0UpMMBo78QMeqzy6BlEZfdI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBz_YQkXft4gEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

department of Education wanted to admit 55 English-Speaking learners in the
wake of a backlog of learners not admitted in schools.School
advocate Albert Lamey told the court that enforcing directives which stand
against the school's language policy contradicted the Schools Act."You
cannot expect the school, against its language policy, to admit English
learners in a school whose medium is Afrikaans," Lamey told the High
Court.Lamey
also argued that the school had reached its admission capacity and that the
department made no effort to determine the school’s capacity.Parents
who were affected by the decision said that they had to travel for longer
distances to take their kids to school when Overvaal was nearby. "It's
unfortunate that from where we are observing it, it's nothing but a racial
issue, there is high racism that is taking place in that area and we believe
that they are doing so to deny our children access [to] that school,"
parent Thloriso Mofokeng is quoted as saying..
