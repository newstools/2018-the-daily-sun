WHEN schools have bad matric results, it puts the department in a bad light and principals have to account for that.This is what provincial DA spokesman for education, Jacques Smalle, said during his visit to underperforming schools in Seshego Township outside Polokwane, Limpopo. Smalle visited ME Makgato Secondary School and Seshego High School on Friday.Both schools achieved less than a 40% matric pass rate last year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstlQBJXAcnjn6XD0iOpGkAYhQB-Tg1tyDA-R3qEUyevUBseWyHgBIK7QJZQhwnsHJ3w1uPU8ychBEs4WYojzr-zJ7YcOtNUkkCzmhYRjZ-POofAzvk7i1kRxZuVSSb3ukxi0Hz4neZIOVN2Zj2T1KbTbjV5CNYXMwGXrZKl-ycSvxrzR7Xm4TpLjYaDDq_01FMeehwodlto--CwQGDcurc_cjZo0qTjlxh7GIN-9BoX-OLYIRcBDoGUPulLg2sh-aHxXQI_UUNU_-boa5NN1Wr_xwJRlOM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzD7y6ZkZtlcwEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We just have to manage our curriculum well. One of the challenges we are facing is that more than 50% of the pupils are not ready for matric, but teachers will work hard to bring them up to scratch.”
