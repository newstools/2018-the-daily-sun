This is a challenge we need to face, mental strength and team work will see us go through.”The second leg is billed for Nigeria on 27 January.Banyana Banyana’s success in the Cosafa Women’s Championship last year will act as a huge motivation to the young players.Last year Basetsana players had to juggle between their school work and football, as most were still in matric.SunSport understands none of the girls have failed, which has proven to the coach they were coping and will do the same in these two crucial matches.Khumalo stated: “There’s not too much pressure on them compared to the last few months where they had to focus on schoolwork, and come back to the national team. They are much more relaxed now and some have played Nigeria before. “They are aware of what to expect and they are willing to fight for a World Cup spot. “This is one in a lifetime opportunity for some of them, as they are part of the Under-20 for the last time this year. It would be great if they could qualify.”
