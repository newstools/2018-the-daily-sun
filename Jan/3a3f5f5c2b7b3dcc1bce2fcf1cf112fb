DON’T panic about listeria! This is the advice authorities in Joburg have given residents following the discovery of strains of the bacteria at a supermarket in the city last week. The samples were taken to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases for testing. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv5gfpUe_VWI0Ovs7n3RzY-9PrK-fveYE-ptFOe5C7iVX1k6yFADOJmb2yAlT5BISLiu4V4egwpyKn7iDOjhdB295OXpwvIml4IdEKuEd3dNltCE4AjOnZD-Wh_JSUhl8DIxtRiTApUfrSHnZcQGnQtYpc7l7LF273yI2xQd2KQ7GxIfDT6SRdRlbNQpPUpDEVm7Zm1P6-OyDbSc1UmJWoYC9YGRjSg16lGlX7HpgHE5bUuuT1R4auWJ02aDhTldkrN4xO_n84MuIMUaB22J579pSp_XN8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAX1ZwmthXS4EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

According to the city’s health department, there are 17 strains of the bacteria but not all of them cause disease. Phalatse commended the city’s environmental health practitioners for uncovering the bacteria. “We are awaiting lab confirmation of whether or not this is a strain of the organism that causes disease.“We should have results in the next 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, residents should visit a clinic if they start experiencing symptoms,” she said. “Pregnant women, babies and people over 65 should be extra careful.” To prevent getting infected with the bacteria, all surfaces in contact with food should be sterilised.
