KAIZER Chiefs head coach Steve Komphela is a delighted with his team’s 2-1 win against Baroka FC in Limpopo on Sunday.What makes Komphela happier is that AmaKhosi bounced from a goal down to win the match, thanks to goals from Ryan Moon and new recruit Leo Castro to end their hoodoo against the Polokwane side. The only thing worrying Komphela now is fact they lost key member of their team in the red-card to midfielder Joseph Molangoane after an unnecessary elbow charge.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuN_TE3bja9MUXgim3NH6ELfEYl59uyx2_kGQqzpnvpYyaCv36IS5gxSKYleQGR_axtw0D0TQYW0cOatjBEtyqnHZmCsKydxcrQsXWUCKgVdAevv3Aar5DpO7mE6iEW7aH5SW7UR6AabcZSeBeEoAmDrg9XtO3qcXQYvKpIDbw3lkoNuz1uSu4m5QA74hq6j0mE1RhoYxNvFkqKj3YfozbjoO0qmKb1leyyVyHT3aChejlu7iRL1CmaHvuBL9IutI5LE-2O0IpDuDneEk22y0dISw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEQanlvalb1PEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I am delighted with the win and the character we showed coming from a goal down to win. This adds on top of what we have and we will try to push on. It’s that time of the year where all three points count.”He added: “One thing we need to highlight is that our character is built. In any situation there is no lose but learning. In any predicament it’s either you reveal or build.  Look, we also managed to get results at the back of a red card and won the match. The experience of previous matches is been built and the believe and confidence is there. I hope we shall carry on like this.”On their new sinningLeonardo Castro who scored the winning goal on debut and became hero to AmaKhosi faithful, the former Free State Stars and Maritzburg United coach said: “He (Castro) did well. The beauty of it is that each time we put in a new player he scores. You can go as far with the likes of Wiseman Meyiwa, Ryan Moon and Siyabonga Ngezana. “The beautiful thing about striker is that when they score the confidence goes higher. We are happy for them, let them score. They will get to the level which we will feel they are our fabric and cloth. It’s good to get results.”The former Bafana Bafana captain also praised another new signing Ntshangase, who also got his debut against his former team.Chiefs are currently third on log with 29 points from 18 league matches. They are five points behind leaders and their rivals Mamelodi Sundowns, whom they are playing in their next league match on Saturday at FNB Stadium (8.15pm).“It will be an interesting game and everyone will have a desire to win it,” he said.
