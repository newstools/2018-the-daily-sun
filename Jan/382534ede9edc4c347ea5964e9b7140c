Then I realised I could make a career out of it,” he said. “That’s why I decided to go to school and study animation.”Most of his sketches are of celebrities such as rapper Cassper Nyovest, DJ Black Coffee and presenter Maps Maponyane.“I’m inspired by local celebrities and their hard work,” said Heath.One of the highlights of his career was meeting Maps.The TV presenter thanked Heath for drawing him and posted a picture of the sketch on Instagram.Heath said he loves to draw portraits. “My sketches celebrate the uniqueness of every individual,” he said.Although Heath also does water colour and oil paintings, his preferred tool is the pencil.He said it takes him about three days to complete a drawing. “I’m planning a solo exhibition and animation series.“I want my art to celebrate the beauty of South Africa and address the issues that affect society.”
