About an hour later, four men were spotted with rifles fitted with telescopes. “When they spotted the Metro police, the men started shooting at the cops, who returned fire and fatally wounded three suspects. “When the area was searched, police came across 15 men and arrested all of them.” Among the guns confiscated by cops were a .270 rifle, two .303s and one .306. There was also a 9mm pistol with its serial number filed off. Kgasago said: “The suspects are expected to appear in the Boksburg Magistrates Court soon.”
