serious political developments, and court judgements which necessitate an
urgent parliamentary sitting to entertain a Motion of No Confidence against
Zuma," said EFF leader Julius Malema.Malema requested that the speaker start the process of
rescheduling parliament programme if Zuma is still president.Failure to do so, he said, will leave them with no option
but to take up issue during SONA.DA leader Mmusi Maimane announced through a statement on
Wednesday that he had asked Parliament to postpone SONA until Zuma had been
removed as head of state."As things stand, it would not be in the interests
of South Africa for President Zuma to deliver the State of the Nation Address
when there exists great uncertainty as to whether he will remain
president," Maimane said.Parliament
spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said presiding Officers of Parliament will consider
requests by the DA and EFF on the postponement of State of the Nation Address
and Motion of No Confidence in the President, and respond.
