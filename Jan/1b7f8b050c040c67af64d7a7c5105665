She said she felt emotional when she visited the family.“Their living conditions are terrible. Their RDP house was collapsing and they couldn’t see all the things wrong around them because they’re blind,” Marry said.“But since I met the mum and her daughter, I’ve gone all over, seeking help to improve their lives.” She has managed to get someone to donate floor tiles, and the man volunteered to tile the floor at no cost.“We have new inside doors that must be installed and painted, but we still need furniture. “We plead with people out there to help improve their lives,” said Marry.Johanna said life has been difficult for her and her daughter.“But it’s something that we are used to. My house is not properly electrified, which puts our lives in danger. We don’t have furniture and most of our belongings are on the floor.” She said she lost her sight when she was very young.“My daughter lost her sight five years ago.” Dr Mabowa Makhomisane said Johanna may be suffering from an age-related macular degeneration disorder.“This is a rare inherited condition where the visual centre of the eye degenerates and stop working at a specific age, leading to blindness. The mum and daughter should be examined to get to the right diagnosis,” said Makhomisane.
