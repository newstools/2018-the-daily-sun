KAIZER Chiefs’ major January signing, striker Leonardo Castro, showed why they were so keen to sign him when he snatched a late winner six minutes from time on debut to earn 10-man Amakhosi a 2-1 Absa Premiership win over Baroka FC at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday.The only sour note was the sending off of Chiefs midfielder Joseph Molangoane.The come-from-behind victory also ended a four-match hoodoo that Bakgaga held over Chiefs. Amakhosi had failed to beat the Limpopo team in any of their previous four meetings in all competitions dating back to April 2011. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuDPCCAtXy5gmxJJClgfqIOnI2jrC_B3IAMvpzgrtDMOWjqzDeH9T3ovMg1xTSTllT-1DpF1kPLrKbWDZUO3c3sCfWOjn82jyU47OSu2qxJREfGhisxvXi7WDjdnTN22FeOncLpRlbRloKjP3VJKt51m7HYz69pvB1FWmEb2Ycfgt4aGO3Xw6UJF7YNRdy1L7u1SjVrnsa1iEJE7IIvRWCdVIq35KEuGeloFVBW4oDxMD1FiRS5KBwDmcd-JawjjuzcJEM4eiD7uJo8LXZbX3BhRQ\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YQFhtvZEaj_7rKRwu5mxT6m_4CUIXMX6DKUTe2ty6-9P6svqKylFguFmRLcZ-OuxawqUot70FFKbZUZenp-wJ0yPRhjxJoCayAKhbWQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEpzgIuQ0QJYEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Chiefs are third – five points behind leaders Downs.Siphelele Ntshangase, signed from Baroka and one of Chiefs’ other major signings in the January transfer window, started on the bench. He did feature against his former employers when he replaced an out-of-sorts Siphiwe “Shabba” Tshabalala in the 58th minute.Bakgaga looked the better side in the opening period and fully deserved their 1-0 lead at half-time when Lucky Nguzana blasted home the rebound after teammate Talent Chawapiwa hit the upright in the 31st minute.After a fiery half-time talk from Komphela, Amakhosi came out firing and levelled a minute after the restart through Moon. But a rush of blood saw Molangoane sent off by referee Chris Harrison for elbowing Khutso Mohwatseleng in the 74th minute. ) Chippa United and Golden Arrows drew 0-0 at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in yesterday’s other fixture.
