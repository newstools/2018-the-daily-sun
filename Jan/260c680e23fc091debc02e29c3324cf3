He said he was sorry and helped me get dressed. Then he said we should start a relationship. I only agreed because I wanted them to let me go,” she said.

When she started crying, the driver tried to stop but she told him to keep driving.Police spokeswoman Sergeant Portia Maleka said the matter is under investigation.
