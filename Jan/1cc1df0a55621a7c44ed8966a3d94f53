But as a team, we can use this opportunity to prepare for the AWC,” said the former Under-20 captain.This encounter will also give coach Desire Ellis a chance to see the five new players: Yonelo Keto, Kgaelebane Mohlakoana, Neliswa Luthuli, Melinda Kgadiete and Sduduzo Dlamini, who will be making their debut in the senior national team after impressing the coach in the Sasol League National Championships that were played in Mpumalanga last year December.This year is a big year for Banyana as they have some tough task waiting for them, which includes qualifying for the AWC and finishing in the top three in Ghana to book a spot in next year’s Womens World Cup in France.Motau told SunSport: “Sweden is a very good country for us to test ourselves and see where we are as a team, our weaknesses and our strengths as we want to fulfil our dream of going to the World Cup.”Cape Town fans are expected in big numbers to fill up the stadium.Entrance to this clash is free of charge.
