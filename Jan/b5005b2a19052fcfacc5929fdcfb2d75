    GREED seems to have got the better of the driver of a well-off madala, who killed him while lying to his kids he’d been kidnapped.But his lie was bust when the old man’s body was
discovered rotting in a pit toilet.According to Punch,
Clement Ekuase was arrested on Tuesday in the southern Nigerian state of Edo
for his alleged part in the murder of Pa Nosakhare Omo-Osagie (87).if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuTg1HhN_a4Ljk7JLXzMZnRgvsY3UKgugBN8TTauD5d7I6wjQxolEHyoPyc8wwatF3kve3gMA-7_lcDXots21Mw4340skQB2mVAUt9n1xnWyB8Cm8ifsY43aJV41lc8NqkBPMQKi6E8seMYiB5SZBRyVdMsd4ONp9zTkBpE0vMcRxJV_pvAhClLQzoOOsOGN3oal9DCT7pyFNETBP_maDz_qaBRpTz-CbiY-KkPAolkQnlrX4I79kkFYJ9ucfPuDoVqXLqDCjuZ3u9c-uUBpIZxM3Ah2eczbvsslw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBEklN46FxqDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

whose Mercedes Benz wagon had been given to him by his kids who live overseas.Cops allege that he clubbed Omo-Osagie to death with a
pestle and dumped the madala’s body in a pit toilet.Ekuase then allegedly stole his car and sold it to a herbalist
who lives in a nearby village.Meantime, Ekuase had informed Omo-Osagie’s kids that
their dad had been kidnapped, and that a ransom of N2 million (about R68 000)
was being demanded.Omo-Osagie ‘s kids apparently paid the ransom, which was
collected by Ekuase.But the promise that the old man would soon be released
turned out to be empty when relatives visited Omo-Osagie’s home and found his decomposing
body inside the pit toilet.Cops caught up with Ekuase as he was trying to collect
the balance of N500 000 (about R17 000) from the villager who bought the car.Cops said Ekuase was arrested with two other unnamed
suspects and will be charged with murder in court soon, according to Punch.
