JOBURG metro police have bust a Nigerian man found with fake money in his white Peugeot 206 after it was pulled over in Heidelberg Road, east of Joburg.Metro cops spokesman Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said officers found R30 000 in fake notes in the car.They then asked the driver (35) why he had such a large amount of cash in his car.“He took the cops to where he lives in Elandspark,” said Minnaar.“The officers searched the house and found about R300 000 in fake money in one of the rooms.”The cops also found machinery which the suspect apparently used to print the fake notes.“The room had fake bank notes lying on the floor,” Minnaar told Daily Sun.“Some had been cut while others were still on an A4 page, awaiting cutting and trimming.“A printer, a pressing machine, inks, papers and offcuts were also found in a smaller room that could only fit one single bed and just a handful of furniture items.”Minnaar told the People’s Paper the currency found included South African rands, Nigerian Nairas and US dollars. He said from the way the offcuts looked, it appeared as if the suspect had been printing the money for some time.The suspect allegedly tried to bribe the officers with real money – R3000 worth of it!The man faces charges of money laundering, possession of counterfeit money and bribery.The owner of the house (45) said he didn’t know the suspect was printing fake money.“This came as a shock to me,” said the landlord.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstubeBxNC7mKQL2ULHmN008GwNtvPYIL3mGw1siwVV-vBfI17UfFAXnZ1I88_zixebYCYKsnDySvSIM7xpjeqLZj_KrXhEVruYx_AlLdBXo14D3R1ECmAfh2gkNohSl3iA5xVpFkqaCFxtdJCV_XHf0n6S60m6KFry-aUnV715XrzT6jNCb6YlHMd01_Sqef4U-BP1RHy5PnY1bgk-8FAkyUUd3ok2IapQfuGqXgnJMYPWb8qUUO_bQktjmJ2rEHI0LwpcZuRl0VsjUoPEpLS1PjMbu5A4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCbt73ZxLtGeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
