Every life matters, whether you’re disabled or not. “We want the truth but she is constantly lying.” Another family member of a victim, Elizabeth Phangela, said: “An apology without an explanation means nothing. She is lying like the rest of them. “She is arrogant, has an attitude and shows no remorse.”Protester Lindiwe Msimanga said: “I’m still hoping that Mahlangu will tell the truth about this mess as the lawyers grill her.” Yesterday, medical law expert Professor Ames Dhai told Radio 702 that Mahlangu’s actions were a crime against humanity.Dhai said Mahlangu is trying to deny responsibility. “It’s clear she didn’t know what was in the best interests of the patients. She lacks any form of ethics, both personal and professional,” said Dhai.Dhai said Mahlangu denied patients their constitutional right to healthcare, adding that 59 Esidimeni patients were still unaccounted for.“She knows that mentally challenged patients can’t defend or talk for themselves, therefore no one will know and she can get away with it,” Dhai said.
