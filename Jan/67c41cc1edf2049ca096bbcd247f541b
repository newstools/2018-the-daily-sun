Neither will hypnosis, acupuncture or aiming lasers at acupuncture points. “Those are probably the three worst ways to quit.”2.

Toss as much booze as you’re willing to part with too. “Half the people who quit end up returning to their old habits with the first trace of alcohol in their bloodstream,” says Fiore. The only solid solution is to eliminate alcohol for the first couple of months after quitting. The other predictor of a relapse is living with a smoker, so if you can convince your wife or roomie to quit while you’re at it, you’ll both have a better chance.3. Delay the gameWhen you get a craving you can’t seem to shake, promise yourself you won’t give in for 60 minutes. Almost every time, the urge will pass by the time the hour’s up. If you have to, spend the hour drinking water, walking around, doing deep breathing exercises or chewing something. “Try to chew something that won’t add a lot of extra kilojoules to your diet, since it’s common to gain a few kilograms when you quit,” says Fiore. Try carrots.4. SweatWhatever method you use to quit, combine it with exercise. A study by the American College of Chest Physicians shows that smokers who combine exercise with nicotine gum or patches are more likely to quit than those who don’t exercise.5. Go pharmacologicalPrescription drugs to help you quit have improved in recent months. Last year, Pfizer’s Chantix (known as Champix in Europe) was approved for use in the US. This pill packs a one-two punch: it mimics the effects of nicotine while simultaneously blocking the reinforcing effects of the nicotine you take in from cigarettes.SOURCE:Health24
