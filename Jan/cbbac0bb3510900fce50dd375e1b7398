Now he is part of the protection unit.Although some cops call him Baby Police because of his height, it is clear his colleagues have a deep respect for him.A photo of Joseph standing with another cop surfaced on Facebook with the caption: “Die kortste polisieman in Kagiso Saps.”Some social media users poked fun at the short cop. Tebogo Lu Oliphant wrote: “Can he climb a fence?” But Joseph’s fellow officers stood up for him. Police spokesman Captain Bashoabile Kale replied: “The police force needs brains, not height.”Othusitse Macomo wrote: “Mmusi taught me that perseverance pays off. “He was a reservist for more than 10 years and now he has been a permanent member of the South African Police Service for more than five years.”Joseph, who was born in Galeshewe near Kimberley, told Daily Sun: “I joined the police force as a reservist in 1996. “I hate crime and I love my job. “People can call me Baby Police; I don’t mind.”
