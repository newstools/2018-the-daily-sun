She said when she went to the Sassa offices in Katlehong she wasn’t helped. “I was told the money was being deducted from my account for stock payment.” Gogo Rachel said she doesn’t even know what stock payment is. “When I went to check my account at the beginning of the month I was shocked that all I had left was a measly R195.“This has caused so much strain at home. Sometimes we go for days without food and have to beg from our neighbours,” said gogo Rachel.She said she’s afraid her grandkids might take drastic measures to try and make money to survive. “This is stressful because I’m sick. “My grandchildren are going back to school and need uniform and stationery. That’s why I feel like I don’t want this grant any more because all it seems to do is cause suffering in my life,” she said.Social development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said: “Grants are provided to alleviate poverty. If anyone is found to have exploited that, they will be dealt with as the deductions are illegal. “We will follow up on this matter to ensure that gogo’s funds are released.”
