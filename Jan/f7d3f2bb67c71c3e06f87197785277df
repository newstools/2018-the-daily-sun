In the video, the suspected taxi driver asks the paramedic why he is using the ambulance to transport passengers instead of patients. The man demands that the paramedic hand over the money he made. Emergency medical services district manager Sello Mohlakoana said three unauthorised passengers were in the ambulance. He said the paramedic has been employed by their department for more than six years. Mohlakoana said: “The video clip was taken on Wednesday. The paramedic allegedly picked up hitchhikers and drove them to Wepener taxi rank. He was immediately suspended.“We are still busy with our investigation and can’t confirm whether the driver was drunk.”
