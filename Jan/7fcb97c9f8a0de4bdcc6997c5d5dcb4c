FOR as long as heads of African football associations put faith in European coaches, African teams will continue playing second fiddle on the international stage.This is the considered opinion of Samuel Eto’o, the most decorated African footballer of all time.Eto’o, who is in the country as the ambassador of the Castle Larger’s African five-a-side football competition, didn’t mince his words as he shared his views on the ills bedevilling African football.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvUy5GV_PVdCcQoIXwVpXyhTdrbCGg0Qgs1Fgz-8H23UqPF6Hlukbv-bXAIwA7NWLJOwdr5QdcFRwuwLTVMpawILDSWMqinkQhRpagqyTop6k3XIc9r-ZSSE3z71sro5VHnR03Ar4AwMwOz-eDZSVrqW14fzV0rMLlv4MqNb8FCKgZzzpD3aBG3dvhDJ3E7uTB69vwWrk4NIRvaIl4EU_UwIH_MVrBccbLfUXQF6YfIngN_CXBfplVrCEDnRBW93DLjQSi893VSbz00ZKtM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP4hOCCyYLWPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

When you go to the league in France, England and Spain, you never have African coaches. You have coaches like Benni McCarthy. But no one is going to give him an opportunity in Europe. Africans need to do the same. Put Africans first.”Eto’o, who plays for Turkish Super Lig side Antalyaspor, reckons South Africa has an abundance of resources, including financial.But he suggested authorities should organise better in order for Bafana Bafana to do well internationally.“Most players can stay in Africa if as a continent we are better organised,” said Eto’o.“The continent can develop, not only in football, but everywhere else. In politics and the economy.”Among the local players he is familiar with is Steven Pienaar, with whom he played at English Premiership side, Everton.But he spoke profoundly about Doctor Khumalo, saying he was one of the best African footballers ever. He further suggested Khumalo, the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations winner, would have won the Ballon d’Or if he were “white”. Eto’o, who turns 37 in two months’ time, didn’t rule out the possibility of completing his career in the Premier Soccer League, saying: “I want to enjoy today. Tomorrow is far. You’ll never know. I love football and want to enjoy it more.”The four-time Africa Player of the Year is also not bitter about not winning the Fifa World Player of the Year award, having come third behind Frank Lampard and winner Ronaldinho in 2005.But he believes an African could still win the Ballon d’Or, one of the two most prestigious individual honours in international football. And who’s the best between Messi or Ronaldo? Definitely Messi!
