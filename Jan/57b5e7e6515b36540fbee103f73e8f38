wearing blue overalls and pretending to be municipal workers entered the same house
and told the victims they came to fix the meter readings.When shown the entrance, the pair confronted the
complainants, produced firearms and demanded money.Mojapelo said when this failed, the suspects pounced on two
of the complainants and grabbed their necklaces and fled on foot."We want to warn our communities to be vigilant and
always demand positive identification before granting any person access to
their homes," Mojapelo said.
