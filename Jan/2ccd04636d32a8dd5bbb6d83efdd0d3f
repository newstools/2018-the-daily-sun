Both pleaded not guilty.Mdluli has also been charged with fraud relating to the unlawful appointments of family members as paid police officers in crime intelligence, as well as being accused of allegedly misusing money from the police's slush fund to purchase luxury vehicles for his family members.Mbalula also announced that the process to appoint the head of the Hawks was underway and that an advertisement for the position had been published. He added that an Independent Interviewing Panel would be appointed to advise him on a fit and proper shortlist of candidates to choose from."I invite our members and all South Africans who have this career passion to apply," said Mbalula.The closing date for applications is February 9.NEWS24
