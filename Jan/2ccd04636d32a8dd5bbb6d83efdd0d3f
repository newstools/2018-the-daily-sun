Suspended Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli’s position will, for the first time in six years, be vacant after he was granted early service termination, which includes benefits. Speaking at a media conference in Pretoria on Wednesday, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula announced that Mdlui - who held the position of Divisional Commissioner at Crime Intelligence, albeit under a prolonged suspension - was being relieved of his duties with immediate effect. Mbalula said that the termination was a mutual agreement. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstvVoloLWHelcJOYG1jwmOsDRNk3VEeJN-z__0yRPcFtRRMaxM365mBjpuFDFIY-oFPKvCvjm7X_vBZuQMpIvrXijUM6YWGgeGKrr-hyzFkhhfZ6A8sRmL367dSOi1Gz_gCT81RO_EJvdSrkFSQy-hoH9LDsEo37CIQkSvlWimFRvFiGVZoBO2LA51tZEQIF3h9AZBrhBx-LXaTbD7-RZYLppOIlXrQi3WMYl2_wreFxXTE604gcA-_bo3efKsWYrpPUBM5NinT9exNv1C4KCByVo5zCs8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNXo59uok-wBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Both pleaded not guilty.Mdluli has also been charged with fraud relating to the unlawful appointments of family members as paid police officers in crime intelligence, as well as being accused of allegedly misusing money from the police's slush fund to purchase luxury vehicles for his family members.Mbalula also announced that the process to appoint the head of the Hawks was underway and that an advertisement for the position had been published. He added that an Independent Interviewing Panel would be appointed to advise him on a fit and proper shortlist of candidates to choose from."I invite our members and all South Africans who have this career passion to apply," said Mbalula.The closing date for applications is February 9.NEWS24
