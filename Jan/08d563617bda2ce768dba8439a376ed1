The association’s spokesman, Lesiba Kekana, said a driver belonging to the association was robbed and killed last month.“Our drivers are sure it was the drug group because we know their actions. They rob people in the morning.“This is their second attack on our drivers. We’ll be burying the first man this weekend in Zeerust.” He said they didn’t find any suspects and have asked their drivers to leave the matter to the police. North West police spokesman, Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone, said no arrests have been made.“Two people were taken in for questioning but were later released. However, investigations continue.”
