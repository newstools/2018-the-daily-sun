    THE same hospital that offers “3D Vagina” treatment is
now offering to “end your dark penis problem” through laser treatment.According to Coconuts,
Lelux Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand put up its new offering on its Facebook
page. It calls the procedure “Pikachu laser” because “Pikachu” (from the Pokémons)
is Thai slang for 4-5s.In the Facebook post, the hospital says: “The most
talked-about treatment right now. [To achieve] pink, white Pikachu. End your
dark penis problem. It doesn’t hurt or require recovery. Ready to score right
after it.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvOyO7NCEti5EE_ltnMJsX5VrXrw3KJVTIbNisIy0yIwYIbhunmfarzrxwttiT3JS-vgJ6854V9MguGFHfHo-nRxxIvueRIYZOhMnXcbH9UViBjvtvQKmxUHqXxuF2fLzhVgJ1Vanjk8nnwl9_KBme7W3EWfEMdU0ILqkoL8k54WERTVxjUopVIijog6Cm53xG5XMN396WhgF0I46jQZwXQt_t6ggsacGjzNp7ozobBzs2mCQiAOw0XkuXCa9JEujsKE4spRtZ1KeMnIyNouzxNGktzP_tOgfk9YQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzC1jUZfl9L-jEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

treatments.It is unclear exactly how a laser can remove melanin.The report claims that Thai’s are obsessed with paler
skins and that millions of people have viewed the post.A man interviewed about having his 4-5 lasered is quoted as
saying: “It was much lighter. I’ve had three treatments and now feel better.”“I’m much more confident to wear swimsuits now when I
travel.”
