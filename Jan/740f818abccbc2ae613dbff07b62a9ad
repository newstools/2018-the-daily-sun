MARITZBURG United's Multichoice Diski team coach Siya Mdluli is confident that Ujaun McDonald and Lindokuhle Sithole who were recently promoted to the first team will live up to the expectations.The two 18-year-old midfielders have been marvellous to watch in the Diski Challenge and their hard work and dedication has earned them a place in the first team.McDonald is an attacking midfielder, and Sithole is more defensively-minded in the engine room. Both are joining the endless list of players that made their mark in the reserve league to earn a contract with the first teams, which include Mamelodi Sundowns starlet Keletso Makgalwa and Siyabonga Ngezana of Kaizer Chiefs.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssqobiLlRouXz85fXXRpNMKYwmAn-86_FYWuZbvbzDl5RaYFmPlkk_UyDmo49XZz7QLtTB5z1smlUQf2j19FdWLk-9AuKaFdpGyLjRu9il-oZwyScV9zLjJA8EcgRfaZ5kENGbbWY1lCMms5sMn6wNNTLSD7sH8AjlmVa8HBCl1LNYzaO3Cv7mRQBNEsQTKDPx5ohqqEkLaUJqs_m9TZSbVgGAwtoW8UOpt2UK3QvXmYmRmxfxrsDoSQY69j7LLFSR8pCKK_OmraujmAzTT\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPrSQnKmOXDYEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Then they came to the MDC team and did well. So it’s a matter for them now to really make use of their chance with the first team.“They have showed their willingness to work hard to take the next step forward. I think they will do well. Now it’s about how long they will take to adapt to the first team.”In the past few seasons, the Team of Choice have also promoted the likes of Bandile Shandu, Lebohang Maboe, Siphelele Ndlovu and Fortune Makaringe, who once played in the MDC.“Because of the way we train, everything is on the table and made clear. So for young players with such talent, I’m sure they will adjust quickly and will go far in their careers with the discipline and quality they have.“It’s also good for us as coaches working with these young boys to see the first team coaches appreciating our work.”
