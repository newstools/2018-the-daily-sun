    ANC stalwarts have a list of resolutions for 2018, and topping that list is a call for President Jacob Zuma to step down. In a media release with the heading, “Reclaiming our history for the sake of our future”, the stalwarts called for unity within the party.“Real party unity can only be built on our historic principles, values and integrity as practised by comrade OR Tambo,” read the statement.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/Landing&sz=300x250&c=1698644300&t=artid%3d54f276fc-d7de-4f88-9868-3984359a1b2b%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/Landing&sz=300x250&c=1698644300&t=artid%3d54f276fc-d7de-4f88-9868-3984359a1b2b%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>The stalwarts condemned corruption under the presidency of Zuma, calling on him to give the new leadership of the ANC an opportunity to prepare for the 2019 elections.“The perception of corruption and criminality in the presidency should not be wished away.“A starting point, and a clear message to the country, would be for our president to voluntarily step down in the interests of country and the ANC.“If he really loves the ANC and wants it to remain in power by 2019, he would assist by handing over the leadership of the country to the newly elected president of the ANC to better prepare for the election.”The stalwarts condemned acts against minority groups.“The ANC returns to being a unifier, committed to creating a non-racial, non-sexist society that has no place for tribalism and ethnic interests over those of our country,” said the statement. Political analyst Ralph Mathekga said Zuma’s resignation should be at the top of the agenda when ANC leaders meet next Wednesday.
