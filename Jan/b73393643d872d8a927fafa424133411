FREE State Stars’ Belgian head coach Luc Eymael has roped in fellow-countryman, striker Maxime Cosse (25), as Ea Lla Koto move to beef up their attack for the second round of the season.General manager Rantsi Mokoena confirmed to SunSport that Cosse arrived yesterday from third tier Belgian club Patro Eisden Massmechelen.Said Mokoena: “Cosse will sign a 12-month deal but we will probably sign another striker before the close of the January transfer window.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu5zEXBp778UITVA5lUP9VVJCFxfx9G1Y2cV9vTFpxaOFbK7Xc4lXibe1DyJRiJmEJr_6k3FrzstOV9t-rNTHifVMmtSf3a2RmceuKU1cOST6gBh0KcK0gstdsUgorw-UJcZ6YessvBKNf3fxTVnqqVLt6m0QjvojNHNWunkeXE7nqgeaIts9DQ-aNULUyx1yoHyNmrvtRc3Y2hFv63Rkg01lccu27JmOWqLq59goe619sLmu5TQv5Lib31BVbzYeLgI5iDjP0F9jbHXxZfAO6wwg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOSQVxSXoEQEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He did a fantastic job last season but he won’t just walk into the side. He will have to fight for his place, as we have Ivorian Badra Sangare in goal at present. But having Ngobeni back is a huge boost.”It appears that Sangare will keep his place for Friday night’s Absa Premiership clash with struggling Ajax Cape Town at  the Cape Town Stadium (8pm).Mokoena said Sangare was not to blame for last weekend’s shock 4-0 home defeat at the hands of Maritzburg United.Said the Stars boss: “That defeat was just one of those things. It’s no big deal – all sides lose at some stage. “It’s great that we are pushing for a top eight finish this season instead of fighting relegation. Overall this has been a good season for us.”  Mokoena also revealed that left back Patrick Phungwayo and coach Eymael have buried the hatchet and made peace.He confirmed the player and coach had a falling out but said the issue was sorted and that Phungwayo had signed a two-year contract extension.Explained Mokoena: “Disagreements happen all the time in all walks of life and football is no different. Patrick and the coach had a falling out but that has been resolved and we are delighted that the defender has agreed to sign an extension to his contract that will keep him at the club for another two years.”
