We swim in the canal as there are no parks and swimming-pools ekasi. “I’ll only stop swimming in the canal if the municipality builds pools,” he said.Sundays River Valley municipal manager Sydney Fadi said residents threw rubbish in thesewage system.He said: “One of the problems is that residents dump large objects in sewerage pipes. “These end up clogging the entire system.
