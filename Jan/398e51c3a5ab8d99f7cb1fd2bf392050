With every day that passed, more and more sewage spilled out into my yard and eventually reached the food garden, destroying my whole harvest!”Her festive season was ruined as her kids had to visit relatives for Christmas because of the kak that had taken over her yard.“My kids got sick and I had to move them away as the smell was unbearable and putting their health at risk,” she said.Nelly said she’s been trying without success to get the city to help. “I’ve reported the matter countless times only to get empty promises. I need my garden back. The municipality needs to come and clean my yard,” she said.She said only her peaches escaped harm as they were hanging from a tree.“I can’t reach them though because of sewage underneath the tree.” City of Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said the municipality had been dealing with a high volume of blockages in the area and it affected their response time.
