He said each bursary was valued at R130 000 per year and covered the cost of tuition, accommodation, meals, textbooks, academic resources and monthly allowances. “This translates to a total of R3,9 million invested for first-year students.” He said the pupils will study civil, structural, transport, electrical, mechanical and chemical engineering as well as hydrology, analytical chemistry and construction. Twins Koketso and Bonolo Rakgalakana (18) from Mamelodi High School, east of Tshwane, were among the recipients. They both got seven distinctions and will study chemical and mechanical engineering at the University of Cape Town. Bonolo said she studied hard for her exams because she always dreamt of going to university.She said: “I put in the extra hours and asked lots of questions.”
