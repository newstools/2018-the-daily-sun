I was only trying to please my ancestors,” said Tsietsi. “I was performing a ritual on Friday morning with some of my patients. I do it every year. Then out of nowhere, a neighbour peeped through a window and alerted the community. In minutes I was surrounded by residents who accused me of evil deeds. “They wanted to necklace me for doing what my ancestors want me to do. I took my stuff and ran away. Now I am living in fear that they might look for me and finish me off. “This is not the first time I have been accused of witchcraft. Last year, I was attacked and labelled a witch after I was caught sprinkling holy water in the street at night. I got hot klaps and my muthi was taken away. I didn’t open a case because I was afraid things would get worse,” said Tsietsi.Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said: “I advise Tsietsi to go to the nearest police station.”
