Unlike the fictional superhero that saves the day, Magasha of Section 17 in Mamelodi East is liked by many and loathed by some.The pensioner is a self-proclaimed attention seeker known for gate-crashing weddings and parties, and even stealing brides’ attention. He said he’s practising for when a black man is cast as Superman, so he can audition. He admits he has left many brides confused. “When I arrive at weddings, people turn their attention to me. This makes confident brides happy but insecure ones are bitter.” He said he will only retire from impersonating Superman when he appears in a film as the hero.He said some people think he’s drunk or mad but he’s just an entertainer. Olga Mongwe (32) said: “Even if you are sad his antics will make you laugh. But he should be careful as he’s an old man now. “He could trip and fall.”
