scathing statement, the EFF did not hold back.“The EFF
calls on Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to learn to keep quiet; for at
times, silence is golden.“Each time
she speaks, and because it is not even necessary for her to do so at all times,
she continues to tarnish the reputation of the respectable office of the Public
Protector,” the EFF said.“We say
this in relation to her recent comments that the remit of the Commission of
Inquiry into State Capture can be extended beyond what is directed by the
remedial action of the Public Protector’s State of Capture Report.“In so
saying, Mkhwebane seeks to give credence to Zuma’s ill-intention to overburden
the scope of the inquiry so that it never really arrives at holding him
accountable for his corruption with the Gupta family.”The Ahmed
Kathrada Foundation welcomed the president’s announcement.“We
reiterate the views of Madonsela that the commission should focus specifically
on state capture under President Zuma, and must investigate the allegations of
state capture against the Gupta family,” it said.“We agree
with Madonsela that the President has the prerogative to set up other
commissions that focus on pre-1994 cases of state capture. The Zondo Commission
however, must be very specific and not unnecessarily drawn out to include other
cases.”
