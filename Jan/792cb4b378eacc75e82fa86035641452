The news that radio presenter and comedian Tumi Morake and her family were involved in a car accident on Friday has been met with disparaging comments on social media, including that the incident was "karma".  Other users have stated that those who were criticising her following a dangerous accident were being racist.    Morake, who was travelling with her husband and three children, was driving towards Sun City in a sponsored silver Jaguar when the head-on collision took place on the R556. The occupants of both cars sustained minor injuries. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst7FzTUtk-FvlOpzS2zfzaS8QjKfljR4-3yg8QgtM5cvJggc22GAkH0adrtycBgSahiFD_H1Hi66tQYk1kJK5ovXr4f5eikrHVX3nb8z2S0-V0eI_LUqowfPHdapHqa6o5y5cFAyzyZj-xw88kbw52unJNlig1o7VDZHKt3IagAhCrtoD6G_L63ksZnVkiUV_zub3ZZcqZ81RlXYZO66GhJqWNWWWipgDEvH3aO8pEw8ZAzwWLGIplhkBH-e-VtDsG99Bec_B_bUgk0y3GLJgh22eiVfcSKewxvEw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNMwEqugVxzCEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Screen grabs from comments on the Intelligence Bureau SA post on the accident were being shared on Twitter. Users said the accident was "blind justice" and that "karma is a bitch".
