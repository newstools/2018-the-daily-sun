Today I let go of my future plans, the man I saw as the father of my kids and my future husband, love of my life, my best friend,” Khanyi said.This has come as a shock to the entertainment industry as the couple were said to be secretly engaged just two months ago.Khanyi and Tebogo had been together for eight years.
