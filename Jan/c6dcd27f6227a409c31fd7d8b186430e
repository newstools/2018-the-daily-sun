She said it was time to show the mayor the residents had more power than he did.  “Instead of accepting that his actions were wrong, he bragged to us that no one could unseat him,” claimed Mpotseng.  “We will shut this town down. If he doesn’t step down in four days, schools, clinics and shops will not operate.”  She claimed that residents tried to speak to the mayor, but he showed no signs of respect. Lebohang Mashiloane, co-ordinator of the Maluti-a-Phofung residents, claimed there’s no peace in the municipality.  There’s only one person who steals people’s joy, and it’s the mayor. We’re gatvol of his actions,” said Lebohang.  He claimed.  “We thought he was spending money for the community, only to find that we were helping him put money into his pockets.”  Masetjhaba Mosia-Lakaje from the municipality said they’ve heard about the allegations that people were hired improperly last month. “We also heard that they were paid before they started working. However, I can’t confirm whether these allegations are true because I was not part of the hiring process,” she said. She added that the municipality will wait for the actions taken by the residents in four days time as they have explained to make a shutdown.
