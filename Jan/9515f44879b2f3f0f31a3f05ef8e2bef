    THE scramble to register players for the Caf Champions League continues in earnest at Mamelodi Sundowns.With the deadline set for Monday, Downs coach Pitso Mosimane is yet to finalise deals for three players he is looking to recruit and possibly include in the squad for the upcoming 2018 Champions League.Among those tipped to join the Brazilians is SuperSport United striker Jeremy Brockie, who is hankering for a move across the capital city.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstVhzLGwKGDbXk3D7eo7S2FbGzVPqDUlKNNkG8dddvcSxJcM8q_MOOecrI59Kfll3DLfYLbOEaLXcIdYqgt3yzkC8zMZiNpUn-oz59rK2nEum4P4Tc0Ir5sO6Ldwm3pf_riAhfa22BC1g199D1-SctS-LJxn9xXYAE-QeUXDfWkusmIT-1CUdtZzr7yCBntS4JxesvSd4Oawqn18NmcjAGbLoHmgX5qzTbd1iCUkhuJ-UH97Nwd4N9SqTHWfGnAZFxvM8KJ16buT5Hp7juwu-MOUA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDOHKXQthA9iEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We need to bring at least three players before Monday,” said Mosimane.“This is the period we sign. We don’t sign in June.”According to Caf’s rules, all teams taking part in the Champions League should register their squad by tomorrow and no other players can be added until August.Clubs are allowed to register a maximum of 30 players for the competition in total.But if less than 30 are registered by the 15 January deadline, then extras can be added in the second period of registration prior to August.The regulations mean that the players Sundowns sign during the January transfer window would only be eligible to play in domestic and PSL competitions.But a piece of good news for Mosimane is that Caf has approved the new format for club competitions.The decision forms part of the implementation of the resolutions passed at last year’s football in Morocco that will see the competition run from September to May from next year.The current calendar for the Champions League begins next month and is set to be concluded in December.
