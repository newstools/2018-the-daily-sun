OUT of favour Baroka FC goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke aims to reclaim his number one jersey from Virgil Vries.Masuluke continues to warm the bench at Bakgaga despite being a hero last year when his overhead kick saw him become the first African player to reach the top three of the Puskas Award.The 24-year-old has not  played an official match this year and the last time Masuluke had the nod in Kgoloko Thobejane’s team was in June last year during the relegation/promotion play-offs. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstl5I2mK5Dg9-u0nKOymijxrdIdan6nDz51pRLIAGswtxlh7IiuCpyKCpdGPGCUa3YnHvoplsohRsSIrYPRCmjCDd04Hj1yM89Fo9TjYKqM0E4JXGCBng_NO7YIz5SROicyoueeHlvEwvWTqcsCgNcU-4sNIZj4h93ahy3hqh7hi15u6c9V8mnl27u4aF-i_FjFrmMeMs95iFzTS7JnFP6Xgado-0SdFgNWxUsDL5dvB_aeTHihD63taQ5Zn20Jl2V7R2ammO2t24Vd0mFUCyO7vg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBXukljrfrJYEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I have been working hard lately and Virgil (Vries) has been outstanding but I will not give up.”However, Vries seems to be struggling to keep a clean sheet as he has conceded 22 goals, which is the highest in the Premiership so far. But Baroka have surpassed all expectations this season, as they are sitting in sixth position on the league table with 25 points from 17 games.  Masuluke hopes to get the nod when Baroka host Soweto giants, Kaizer Chiefs in their next league match at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday (3pm).“I cannot complain about not getting game time.  I think Virgil is doing well and that is why the coaches prefer him. I understand that they cannot play both of us at the same time.“But I will work extra hard to reclaim my position because sitting on the bench is not nice either.”
