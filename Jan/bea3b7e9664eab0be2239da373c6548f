The Cyril Ramaphosa presidency must be causing Ace Magashule a pounding headache.So much that he even played a dietitian over the weekend in his veiled attack against Ramaphosa, warning people not to eat McDonalds because it will make them fat.It must be tough being Ace nowadays.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvfcVYbyxfYwM9FY81wz_kUmCa09axm7lBkt94HCzcjow2T9zcyRkxTnyrVHtxowhG7sjficppIhucrlZQUpv2JvAPQzZTwrJ-6fnNX_vtqlUkosp4DyBMcdeGctab4Xr2BDgozaGVXnM0MXfCjCd8AcAplowFfZoSG6ivBT3NI3IBYFOYHNs-R5DgUC4vFPphHtfuKwf1zBiGAu103SFLFun8lEiv2Hxf4x1XOIL994gMBVg25s-9g3cNtyN_XUVJd053aAP-oaXeviVOn0txoCUg_61Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGYDdQGq-BprEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The big daddy has become powerless and the ANC is taking a different direction from what he is used to.He is even telling members that it's just a matter of five years for the ANC that he knows to return.The question is which ANC is he referring to? Perhaps the one that looked the other way whenever corruption allegations against its members were mentioned. The KZN ANC and its members in particular must be careful of politicians who run to their province every time they have personal battles with the law. Every time Jacob Zuma had issues with the law he would run to ANC KZN to address the masses and make as if it is the ANC that is being attacked. Now Ace is using the same strategy and the ANC KZN must guard against such characters otherwise it will find itself not being able to influence conference going forward.  The people are awake now. Already, there is a group of ANC members who saw through him and picketed outside the ANC provincial headquarters in Durban on Monday warning that his remarks are dividing the ANC.Magashule must face the allegations against him head on and stop making it about his position as ANC SG.He must rest assured that he was elected to that position by the delegates and no one can just take it away from him willy-nilly.First and foremost, he must accept that Jacob Zuma's time as ANC and the country's president is over and he will go, eventually. Secondly, that Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma lost to Ramaphosa and that no amount of persuasion, politicking and rallying can change this fact.And then once he has factored that fact in, he must deal with the allegations against him.The Vrede Dairy farm corruption saw millions of taxpayers’ money landing in the pockets of the Guptas. And now there are reports of a dodgy property deal with the Free State Development Corporation (FDC) that allegedly saw his long-lost daughter score R9 million for doing nothing.All these has nothing to do with the ANC or the SG position ­- it's all about him. If he is clean he will come out of it even stronger.He must allow the Hawks space to do their job and not try to make this look like a political smear campaign.Magashule himself said the law must take its course and if any wrongdoing is found there must be action “without fear”.So why try to pre-empt the investigation? He must face his troubles with the law and stop looking to get blood out of a stone. You cannot extract what isn't there to begin with.
