    THE gap for the National First Division (NFD) title is widening with each game.Highlands Park have made the top of the table their own personal fiefdom having led the race for the better part of the current season. And their 1-1 draw against Real Kings at home, Makhulong Stadium, on Saturday did not make too much damage, as they still remain on summit with 34 points.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvuG4_ZkHzWhgsUF3LXcSJDOBBdN4R3FDSoyehNLJ49AC5XbtIFQdIwh9y1iSd-FM907fI63M6HwIJqcrX8qK-0G31-BLB49d-LXo4SThTVulsVb-MTtgAGh0Xqlvvi8RDSaMHajjLNyOZX3-iHcyaC3y4nHjCilH-RP3b58SCOntgQXyMTUbkh8wXv88ihf2JZzzVR700nzLUroDBv7daGTEfZwW14ynoHXsCb6v9HVhAITiRnThhrbm9s-oylQF7n21ecwPho-UZ5CI4lGXirUQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIVdBfqWYCDwEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But Highlands are watching from the top and see who is coming closer to them. It one season that is funny in its own right, as the team at the foot of the table, Mthatha Bucks, are just five points behind the team in 10th position Cape Town All Stars – out of 17 rounds of matches played, but All Stars have only played a game less.The other ex-PSL side – Pretoria University – look set to spend another season in first division as they are still rubbing shoulders with midtable teams on position five with 25 points from 17 outings. Saturday ResultsWitbank Spurs 2-0 UthongathiHighlands Park 1-1 Real KingsMthatha Bucks 3-3 Royal EaglesMbombela United 1-2 Ubuntu Cape TownRichards Bay FC 2-1 Stellenbosch FC Sunday fixtureJomo Cosmos v Cape Town All Stars (Vosloorus Stadium) Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila v Black Leopards (Thohoyandou Stadium)Both matches starts at 3.30pm.
