    Universities South Africa said on Tuesday that institutions around the country will not allow walk-in registrations for the 2018 academic year.This comes after President Jacob Zuma announced free tertiary education to poor students and working class from this year, and after calls by EFF leader Julius Malema for matriculants who passed in previous years and couldn’t afford university fees to report to academic institutions."We must make sure that in 2018 all academically deserving students are admitted freely in SA universities and FET colleges," Malema said in his end of year message.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvdjEpWCkq-IyI8udaZ2Tn6fUyeWnbY9UM1861dh_LSGHU1OE_Lggvm3VZCeSPrnXK0dIW3BQke6Wgs48phbEJuuuX4X6b7PsfZDuRDIJbbodi25yOSe47Pn-y2og_0brBh2-gW3nYkZG9UOB8iN_P2FsBC6FiW1LiBq9K0gzGcz-1SLJrrQkRGWKbDglsV7Qe6HwE1FVvbmEC0QoiCz6iot5wAs0DMXDn5F2FGVSKkcs9gEZEEWq1IKeOjIp3fJZwoBtxW5DdZyZ8V9auGJ6yAyZGU690\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMoC61f4RduMEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

A clearly defined pathway should be established for such potential candidates," Bawa said."South Africa’s 26 public universities were taken by surprise by the announcement made by President Zuma on the 16th of December 2017."We have raised our concerns about the timing of that announcement and the absence of a clear implementation strategy, implementation plan and adequate roll-out time for such a significant development in the funding of our public higher education system," he said.Bawa said it would have been "ideal" if universities were given a year to roll out the new system instead of "two to three weeks"."We have repeatedly raised our concerns about the use of the student fee issue as a political football. This is not just disingenuous but also opens the way for the issue to be used for purely political purposes as we have just seen," he said.SOURCE: News24
