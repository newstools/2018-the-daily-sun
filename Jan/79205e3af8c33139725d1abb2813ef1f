Former deputy director Makgabo Manamela, former department head Dr Barney Selebano and Marathon Project leader Levy Mosenogi all pointed fingers at the former MEC.Mahlangu resigned the day before the release of the Health Ombudsman’s report last February.She was initially expected to testify in December but her legal team said she was in London writing exams.The DA’s Jack Bloom said Mahlangu should explain why she misled the Gauteng Legislature by saying, among other things, that only 591 patients were moved when the move involved over 1 700 people.“I hope she testifies openly and truthfully without arrogance,” he said.“She should acknowledge her responsibility for this terrible tragedy instead of blaming officials.”Other witnesses expected to testify include Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa and Premier David Makhura.
