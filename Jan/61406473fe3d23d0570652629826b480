    A MAN is in hot water after marrying the daughter of his
wife – without divorcing his wife first.According to Pennlive, Christopher Hauptmann (44) from
Shamokin in Pennsylvania, America did not try to defend himself against a bunch
of charges when he appeared in court last week.Among the charges was that of bigamy, which is the
offence in America of marrying someone while already being married to another
person.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuvzLfT4NGHMpzcK583CDFHKzyGZtqWy24-BpaDK9eV9qZ2Qvfh0o7Yq1TSEDLLMrjso55nr3c0X387f2-3rDrwueISRuLvuYMRElQzm2aCt7g-l4ZhFIpJjuBcltgG0IkTIX_f6T91JxRVlO4ToXhqaaQn6ZWoE0RV_YwNCf-xITkii3R3AOn8EjRtTKJ3YZXJCgok8v1WJe3yTT6m1u1mogsW01htfA6PemTHQaxbj4me1ZuvKhaGsqhONyrVHOeWwR5AGaQtL3s2WHmBbgIvNtccdOosDH7UNA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEd9RaRg5EZAEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But then a year later, he wedded Kaylee Durovick, Deitrich’s daughter. He was
still married to Deitrich at the time. Durovick and Hauptmann are still together.Other charges Hauptmann faces are the illegal possession
of a firearm. He apparently lied when he applied to buy guns that he didn’t
have any previous convictions. Actually, Hauptmann did have a conviction for
drugs, which means he can’t own a gun.Judge Paige Rosini sentenced Hauptmann to a year minus a
day to two years minus a day in prison followed by 10 years' probation. He was
given credit for the 332 days he has been in jail, unable to post bail.
