WHEN newly registered grade 8 pupils arrived at Vaal Reefs Technical High School outside Orkney, North West, they were told they must go to the schools in their kasis. The pupils are from Khuma, Kanana and Jouberton near Klerksdorp. On Monday, kids went to the school with their worried parents. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst6MmRvWHnnbVK9e7dGeMHDJGytpXrVhfqL0jRcLShFqUTkpJFkS-OwHlibvGSRHvZvKn07IuI73K6sATIHXPx0Bmy28nB1pMSwcYA67nMVe5-sR4APqtYV95zKe1JEWcGaL8PtkBBroIlbKqbefaqL04vl0ooJgveUlqOitM_V4IQsMA0qUwtHhPxh6XbplSnhipD0uNBgvqjrawdvzZTcmN20QKpTJVHYsPpM7BQCdXlmCszLTRlEW98bJCHbUAjIhjOaS_kjbMVWEqpQzj0cAtElQJE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAnSNN_Yud5PEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The desperate parents called Daily Sun, and when the SunTeam arrived at the school, they found them in the school hall. The pupils were dressed in their school uniforms but their bags were empty. Their parents showed the SunTeam receipts of R1 000 for school fees.“When we registered and paid last year there were no problems. We bought uniforms and organised transport, but suddenly they are chasing the kids away,” said a parent“This principal is so arrogant. She doesn’t even talk to us properly.”When the People’s Paper called the provincial education department, officials promised to send representative to the school. An agreement has since been reached for the pupils to be officially admitted to the school.Acting North West education spokesman Elias Malindi said there was a communication breakdown between the principal, school management and admin staff.“Earlier, it was agreed the pupils would not be accepted and would have to attend school in their areas.“The admin staff was wrong to admit them,” he said.“But it was later agreed that they bought uniforms and paid school fees, so they must be admitted, even though the school has a high number of pupils.”The parents thanked Daily Sun for its intervention.
