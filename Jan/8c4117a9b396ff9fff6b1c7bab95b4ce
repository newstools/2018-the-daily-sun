After being shot, the wounded man collapsed and was stoned to death by furious residents. The customers, who were also hit by the bullets, managed to drive to local security company Rusa to get help. Rusa spokesman Prem Balram said one of the men was shot in the arm while the other was hit in the backside.“When our members arrived at the crime scene, we found the suspect lying in a pool of blood after being stoned to death,” he said. “We suspect the other three fled the scene after the shooting.” A resident who didn’t want to be named said residents rushed to the scene after hearing gunshots. “Three thugs ran away but one man was lying on the ground with a gun in his hand. Residents attacked him with stones,” said the witness. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “One suspect was fatally shot and the other three managed to flee the scene. “Two bystanders were shot and transported to hospital. Cases of business robbery, attempted murder and murder were opened at Verulam Police Station for investigation.”
