    1.    Take surveys, they really pay outYes, they are annoying and will probably give you a headache after ten minutes, but filling them out online can be worth it. Finding the right survey is quite hard, as there are so many out there. However, there are trustworthy companies that need feedback or data and they are willing to pay you for your opinion. Getting a PayPal account is a good start as most survey companies use this to pay out freelancers.2.    InvestLiterally, anyone can do it and you don’t need to know the ins and outs of the stock market, that’s where your broker comes in. All you have to do is invest in shares in a company, which starts off at 1% and depending on the popularity and success of the company your investment can range from R20 to R1 500.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssN0_vyp868fCUs8-EXbIpHZEwTZhsHEIVjdxSRCOy7mXI42MBMpJkd7gVxc0HHLRGVUdaWJVa04qPKPkMDrdnGadZtnBEmham22jeB_YtlakLKRLm9TPRdH4-HlynOETUghgOJE8iqZ_uMNxlRgPXuBJbAoONdd0jwwOjf6uc74zOA2AGO4DAIjXokIx9sP4CsbVkK-IfmJ9zgUj8aLgncDX1V9sjgvPHtvlJ4939abIYknNrfLUbK3mAvbhJ6qow0v7vL4JjnvaOOYj9ggvVw9rug94s\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAZk3hRPnfnIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

You shouldn’t limit yourself as you never know when the markets will go up or down. In five or more years, your shares could pay out at an interest, and fingers crossed, you have invested in the right company.3.    Use the classifiedsThis is becoming one of the fastest ways to make money off things you already own. All you have to do is roam around your home and find forlorn disregarded items that could still be useful to people. Place an ad and your price and see if someone is interested in buying those miscellaneous items. This is also a fantastic way to declutter your home.Remember: One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.4.    Become an extraSome people make money for literally standing in the background on a film set. Since filming in South Africa is predominantly cheaper than in other countries, a lot of movie executives and producers cut their costs and move an entire production here in order to save money. All you have to do is sign up to an agency; pay a small registration fee (normally something like R150) and the agency will provide you with details on upcoming shoots. Being an extra pays well, but you need to be on standby and possibly be on set for four to six hours at a time, depending on the scene.5.    RecyclingThere’s a tiny ploy to why companies recycle more nowadays, yes it’s important for the environment, but there’s some cash involved as well. Recycling your waste material is actually profitable and although it won’t make you instantly rich, it does pay well. According to Moneybags, Collect-A-Can gives you R10 per kilogram for aluminum cans and steel cans fetch 60c per kilogram.  SOURCE:W24
