first thought she was about 10 years old.At the house cops discovered half-starved, filthy
children, some of whom were tied to their beds. The siblings were aged between
two and 29.The discovery has stunned their neighbours, who claim
they didn’t even know 13 kids lived in the house.Speaking to The Sun,
neighbour Leiticia Gomez said: "They never used their back yard ever. I
never heard a sound, I never saw them."To be honest we always thought they were drug users
or those kind of people because we never saw them and they didn’t take care of
their front yard or back yard."We sit outside all the time and we never heard one
single sound or saw them come out - and with so many kids in one house you
would expect to hear noise all the time. They didn’t let those poor kids live."How someone can do this to their own children it is
terrible."The parents were apparently committed Christians. They
had told authorities they were schooling their kids at home.The parents are due in court tomorrow, with their bail
set at $9 million (about R111 million) each.
