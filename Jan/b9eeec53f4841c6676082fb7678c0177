Already, there's a smell
of fresh air in the corridors of government.South Africa is starting
to look like a country that takes itself and its citizens seriously. The cockiness that
accompanied the Jacob Zuma administration is slowly disappearing into thin air.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu6RVi_fCO1rsmdquH-2dyZ-NX6ArxhvthU7JQoz6tKUBQrFUZQZDWnpxU2oAJBeGf0RB_VkZQsJzaFYhzUzEEth3CXz8c5D9hz0IHkh7NLqTJI805WYHRf0hXDiHbcj3rIxXAZvZatQqFJO2HTXuYV7BvY3n5rxRpJCTdKQ-jTe10y4PJwEdFrTyUbwre2ZI1SkCwhs-HwZUqZztA96tTPm_DWY-eKjTwm5jk0UZj6gukEDFJoXf0_I6n-nZWugLJyjreYXI8EYOBLd2DoCjG4x0oUBYc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPVrAQEESZNmEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

talk by those elected into power is also fading. Finally, officials have the
urge to do their jobs.There's so much happening
that I had to pinch myself just to be sure that I'm alive and all these things
I'm hearing are real.It's a rude awakening for
South Africa. Since the election of
Cyril Ramaphosa as ANC president there are movements in places where there
would normally be nothing. The first shocker to me
was not Zuma appointing of a commission of inquiry into State Capture but news
that the Pretoria High Court has authorised the freezing of R1.6 billion in
assets earned by global consultancy McKinsey and a firm linked to the Guptas
after a request by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).It is then that I knew the
chickens were coming home to roost.The new Eskom board also
breathes fresh air into the state owned company. A big change from the Ben
Ngubanes who spoke as if they owned Eskom. Another highlight is the
latest news that the National Prosecuting Authority has seized control of a
Vrede dairy farm in the Free State, including the bank accounts of Atul Gupta,
companies co-owned by Duduzane Zuma and other entities in the Gupta empire.This are the first few
nails to hit the Gupta coffin and I hope there are many more on the way until
the very last one.One can now tell that
their chief protector has become less powerful if not at all powerless. The
Gupta family members have been untouchable for many years, from the day they
landed a plane at the Waterkloof Airport, a national key point.But in life, every story
has an ending.The ship is surely
starting to sink. It's all thanks to the
selection Ramaphosa as ANC president, even the law enforcement agencies are
starting to grow some balls.Soon after ascending 
to power,  Ramaphosa demonstrated a sense of urgency and professionalism
when he started his first two events on time, doing away with the so called
African time, which often sees politicians arriving an hour late at scheduled
events. This showed government
officials and his fellow politicians that he means business and he is here to
account to the people of Mzansi.That sense of urgency
seems to be rubbing off to others, including the Zuma administration hardliners
such as Bathabile Dlamini.Even though she is saying
nothing about anything at her appearance at the inquiry into SASSA, at least
she showed up.She is not the type to
show up that easily. She had already developed a habit of not showing up even
when parliamentarians wanted to hold her accountable.Let's not forget that It
took the courts to lecture and force her into doing her own job.Under the Zuma
administration,  ministers such as Dlamini and Faith Muthambi felt
untouchable, just to mention a few. As long as they were loyal to Zuma that was
it. All of us got the middle finger. Muthambi presided over the rot at SABC
while Dlamini nearly brought SASSA to its knees. Both are still ministers. They
have done absolutely no wrong in their boss's eyes.But now the tables are
turning. There is a new boss in the house and he will soon get the prerogative
to shuffle and reshuffle as he wishes. You can tell that there is
trouble coming. Even the likes of Malusi Gigaba, who have been silent about the
mess at Eskom for many years, is now taking a tough stand, urging Eskom's
embattled executives Matshela Koko and suspended CFO Anoj Singh, to resign in the interest of the country.It's refreshing that people are
now thinking of the country's interest when they do things. It was a foreign
language all along - again thanks to the new chief of the house, South Africa
will get working.The time of massaging corruption
and ministers acting with impunity has come to an end.  In Gwede Mantashe's own
words "the ANC now has president that is rich and will not steal from the
people". Let's hope this president will also deal harshly with those who
steal from the people. Crooks must be punished.
