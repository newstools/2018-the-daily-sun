Apart from charges of murder and kidnapping, the women also face an assault charge.The suspects were bust in November after the bodies of 10-year-old boys Njabulo Mankayi and Luyanda Msomi were found dumped after they had been missing for weeks.People thought they were beaten, fed poison and strangled.Daily Sun reported the 28-year-old woman suspect allegedly was dumped by Njabulo’s father. Desperate to get him back, she allegedly consulted a traditional healer who told her to get Njabulo’s blood for a love potion.But Njabulo’s father, Thandaza Mankayi, said he dated the first suspect and had to break up with her after she disrespected his wife.
