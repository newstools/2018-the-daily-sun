She is our only child,” pleaded the heartbroken mum.Siphesihle disappeared on 31 December during a church service in the area. Thabisile said: “The church leaders asked those who were attending church for the first time to come to the front. Three of us stood up. I left my child where I had been sitting, and when I got back she was not there. “At first I thought she had gone to pee, but we searched the toilets and she was not there.” Thabisile said she visited the church after she was invited by a woman who had not been seen since Siphesihle’s disappearance. “She came to our house that morning and told me to come to church with my daughter and aunt,” she said. “When my daughter disappeared I told the cops about the woman, but they told me they cannot act without tangible evidence,” she said.Siphesihle was last seen wearing a pink dress and white shoes.KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a missing persons’ docket was opened.Mbhele appealed to anyone with information to contact the police.
