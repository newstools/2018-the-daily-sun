RAPPER Gigi Lamayne has taken a stand on cyber bullying. This comes after she was insulted on Twitter on Sunday over a photo she posted of herself lying on the floor in a black bodysuit with money scattered around her. Although many Twitter users mocked the photo, which Gigi told the SunTeam was taken from her upcoming music video Isaga Lam, the real trouble started when CapeTalk and 702 presenter Gugu Mhlungu made comments. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst2oL7izOfeVjf2VdOvtozGKWVJGEcfPtIXSZox2tkC_PbCe4MUN01cBop6qP-3Swl_U2IecWvNKbJQ_03c7n8McvSoXOMr8A-ZJ_2q-K-aMVPo8ShO80rg8SUIHM3QoQp47rO8DQGulR4UsSWnUgwER4Ym9B6QwfsaM3bFgWul3m4LdYkVkyhi2xJtBU2j16byGzpm9jqfw_RWkXEF8UeATsN4evDNLHBczk3VmAEXucCOPHglf93CYDJXQHA47yivhrM30TC8ROKv4bwTaxyLO-t7fA9Bh9u6MA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMKDJwFQXtjKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Gigi responded by tweeting: “Someone decided to zoom in and claimed to have spotted a cockroach. “First of all, I don’t know why someone such as Gugu would do something like that if she claims to be a feminist. “When she was attacked for the spelling mistakes in the book she wrote for Bonang Matheba, I was one of the people who supported her. “Girls need to start supporting each other instead of body shaming and embarrassing each other.” After Gigi’s attack on Gugu drew attention, Gigi explained herself yesterday by tweeting: “I decided to break my silence this morning. “Last night after I posted a picture trying to promote my foundation, I was met with a lot of criticism, body shaming and most of all, people saying these ugly things about me. “Enough is enough. I have been quiet for far too long. “People do not know what they want. Instead of talking about the right things, they would rather embarrass some of us.”
