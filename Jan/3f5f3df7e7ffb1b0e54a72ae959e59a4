IT’S the new year, so many people take the opportunity to review and change their medical aid plans.  They can adjust their cover, keep the same policies or consider downgrading to a more basic hospital plan.Tony Singleton, CEO of Turnberry Management Risk Solutions, said reasons to downgrade a plan are usually because of financial pressure. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Many families are looking to cut costs wherever they can while protecting themselves.But he said downgrading your medical aid may be a hasty decision, with negative effects later on. Do NOT swap medical aid for gap cover One of the biggest problems in private healthcare is rapidly rising costs – especially for specialists, hospital care and other medical experts. Gap cover has emerged as a vital tool to make sure you’re not left out of pock et – even if doctors charge up to 400% higher than medical aid rates.However, that doesn’t mean that gap cover should replace your medical aid. Gap cover only works if you already have a medical aid policy – it doesn’t work without one.“The starting point when considering health cover is the choice of your medical aid and the medical aid option. One should generally choose the most comprehensive package that you can afford. “Part of this process is reviewing potential shortfalls with your broker who may advise you to take out gap cover.”Listen to your broker Your broker needs to explain what three-month waiting periods, 12-month exclusions, co-payments, sub-limits, designated service providers and prescribed minimum benefits mean.“If your plan doesn’t cover a critical procedure, special financing may be needed to bridge these additional medical costs.“To make sure that you avoid this type of heavy financial burden, a gap cover policy, at a reasonable monthly rate, helps to protect you from these extra expenses, making sure that you don’t need to take out loans or dig into savings or retirement planning.”
