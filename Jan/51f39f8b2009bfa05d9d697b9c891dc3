When the 30-year-old girlfriend received the message, she rushed to the cops and they went with her to the boyfriend’s house, where his body was found.While cops are still waiting for DNA tests to confirm the kids’ identities, people believe two were the girlfriend’s while the third was her sister’s son. The woman didn’t want to speak to the People’s Paper apart from saying she was waiting for the tests and would mourn when she was sure the bodies belonged to her children.The man’s niece, who only gave her name as Maena, said: “We don’t know what happened and will never know. “The whole situation has affected my gogo, who is sick in bed.” Captain Kay Makhubele said the motive for the killings was not known. A murder case and an inquest docket were opened.
