HOMELESS people living under the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Freeway bridge in Durban were left with no choice but to sleep out in the open.  This was after guards employed by the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa burnt their temporary structures on Monday. The security guards had their hands full chasing away the vagrants and clearing the railway line of their structures.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuFNC5o4pMnLAY3qD-Nzw5N7HCaYeK4A4A-VWwQbxKH4rVQrGWUnNyYZoRSDP7IIGwiGcT5hfPeT05F3MDo_rUEcBrwT8cmSqumez58glOpGgZmXhfrBVPb1aBWq8Wovb82jWZhLW9WvVCrgEYaOhohezAPCdLsASRygLTFsBrYI7x1qdF1gUvP_ECyIqx_2wlHcoLD2i-UxTYX_R2-Re2ShP5mk3ZtA0gYFyMfOktgdqYoeQejulln4Dpu0mKA72ZccI1i974jH9K_Up5ZTETv1waqigc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLkCD7cVgrK-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

During the 2010 Fifa World Cup the vagrants were evicted from the park but they returned a few days later. After the city erected a fence around the park, the group found shelter under the bridge and built their new homes there. Residents living in a block of flats near the park said they are tired of being mugged and having their houses broken into.Nompilo Mchunu (35), a resident, said they are happy the structures were burnt and pleaded with Prasa to find a permanent solution to the problem.
