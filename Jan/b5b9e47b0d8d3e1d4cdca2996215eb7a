SOMETIMES a bad start doesn’t always define the end result. National First Division (NFD) strugglers Ubuntu Cape Town seem to be turning things around in the second round after struggling to make an impact in the first round. Ubuntu have registered two victories in a row, defeating Mpumalanga-based outfits Mbombela United away and Witbank Spurs at home with the same 2-1 scoreline, and are confident they could bring down Highlands Park.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssGIgvpor13vpU6okLjRPc9bEz7PKUfs1QF4Qdvdkphyttil0gF0ehq9JjUT-CcvozB7OwgHaRVLOqQ6-pBHoSukqRslsz4XDocQ44BaQez4UeRdYyew0U1ncOcYWSrYVNOmYsgklH-ayqRHJ0KPCvhPJauRiZflXppYysrwY6yVbcYtxmzNLn38c5hirldcB0oLWC6064E8oQ92uIQ6qZFS7uua6GE1GLT2nYpz2VWUx6z2qmuuhI354C6UXOawtEYj3nRdo5CKfm2tZLkzvKDGQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBIlTRcJ84rLEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It will be tough and we are up for a challenge.”The two clubs are going to this encounter under pressure as Highlands want to extend their lead at the summit after playing a 1-1 draw against Real Kings last weekend and Ubuntu want to dodge the dreaded axe as they are in the mix at the bottom of the log with 16 points after 17 encounters. Highlands are one of the most scoring teams having scored 25 goals so far and their defence has been tough as rock to crack as they have conceded less goals (nine) than any other team this season.
