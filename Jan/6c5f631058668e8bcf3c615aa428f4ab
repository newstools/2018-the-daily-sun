They also said the principal promised them quarterly meetings but there had been none. So to express their anger, they closed down the school yesterday, disrupted lessons and sent their kids home. Teachers were also prevented from entering the school’s premises.Parent Jack Monyela (45) said even when they try to arrange a meeting with the principal, they are insulted.Said Jack: “We want the school’s financial books and we want to know what happened to the money our kids paid for civvies. We also want to know about new developments because we’re kept in the dark. The school will remain closed until our demands are met.”This is our school but we are kept in the dark on everything that’s happening Another parent said: “We want to know why the security guards are working only during the day and we want to know about the unqualified maths teacher.”They locked the schools gate and started chanting outside, carrying placards.  The parents said they sent their School Governing Body to resolve their complaints but the principal refused. The third parent said: “We didn’t get our kids’ September 2017 reports and when we enquired, the principal said we were stupid.” We’re being disrespected here and we can’t take it any more.”Some teachers said there was nothing they could do but return home.Limpopo Department of Education spokesman Sam Makondo said they had not received any report regarding the school but would investigate. “Closing a school and disrupting lessons is totally unacceptableWhen there are complaints, let them be resolved on the sidelines while teaching and learning continues because this disadvantages our pupils,” Makondo said.
