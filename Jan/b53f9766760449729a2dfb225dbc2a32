He said he was happy that this time the culprits were found and the goods recovered. “This was the fourth time they have broken into my church. This time they broke into my office and took a ladder and blankets. After they were caught we drove around with them to find the buyers. I managed to recover all the goods,” he said.One of the nyaope addicts said they couldn’t resist their addiction, and stealing was their only option. “We don’t sleep at night because we have to rob to get money to buy nyaope the next day, so the church was our target.”He said they were grateful they didn’t have to face the cops, and begged the bishop to help them quit nyaope. Masombuka said he had decided not to open a case. He said he gave the young men a task of cleaning the church yard as punishment. “I believe they can be rehabilitated.”
