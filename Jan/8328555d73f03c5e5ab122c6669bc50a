SCHOOLS re-opened today but there are problems already. Parents of Mmadikete Lion Secondary School pupils in Maboloka Village, near Brits, North West, are planning a protest after they came to the school on Monday to try and resolve last year’s problems.Many pupils failed badly but parents say it is not possible for so many children to do so badly.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvqZR0215TdgtlhoDnLn0Kk5614z_PhO_mdhDvtMOZNwpr4yrMXCYkAYFtaOAlXKEoZn66kbVTr7M879VfndwAhKPUJqwBWJnFiPAlyDo-jdXWR94g8w5L3UMPuRvfTJnFpZ5HZViIPJ0J1pJDoubXV4PFYjE5qNXzc7WSkY-IPEyuSUhUuUyKKa36vDOobS9z8gF9315o7mCjiu7W9mvG8DLtAZq9f-FoWSs3HxEbZI15IkJHoBG_30FAiqwFeJq8e7FO8XhMRoPEgOcJzYL0kT04L3xE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCtIF7eaxuNxEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

One pupil had two reports, the one giving a pass mark and the other failing the pupil.Parents said when they tried to speak to specific teachers, they referred their queries to the principal.On top of this, the report cards were different from other schools which noted pupils’ historical performance from term to term.These marks were totalled to decide a pass or fail mark, but Mmadikete’s reports only gave the final results. North West Department of Education spokesman Elias Malindi said the department would look at individual cases and intervene.
