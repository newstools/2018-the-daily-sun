Now they are pleading with anyone from SunLand to help them get him back.The madala’s nephew, Olebogeng Magamo (40), said: “My uncle is slightly disabled. “He used to go out and would be back before dawn but the day he went missing, he never came back and we have looked for him everywhere without luck.“I dreamed about him calling me to help him. “He told me he was in a lot of pain because he is being used to feed the cows and pigs at night.“I told my gogo my uncle was feeling cold and is in a lot of pain,” said Olebogeng.“We went to five sangomas to help us bring back my uncle but they are struggling. “The sangoma we recently saw told me to buy some stuff and bring it to him and my uncle would come home after three days, but he never did. “I really want my uncle to come home. I miss him very much. There is no place we haven’t looked for him,” Olebogeng said.Cop spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng confirmed the incident. He said a missing person’s case has been opened and investigations continue. Anyone with information should call investigating officer Constable Teko Shomolekae on the number 078 654 5927.
