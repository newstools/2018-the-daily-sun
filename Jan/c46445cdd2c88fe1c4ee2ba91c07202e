Luckily, police arrived and called firefighters but I lost everything,” said Paul.Abebi Igbo (34) said he heard about the missing teenager from residents. “We don’t do drugs or prostitution in this neighbourhood but people accuse us of doing those things,” he said.He said people must confirm information with authorities first before jumping to conclusions that all Nigerians are involved in illegal activities.Sergeant Tshepiso Mashale said the kidnapped girl was brought to Kagiso Police Station after being found near Chief Mogale kasi. She was taken to hospital and police are investigating. He said it seems the violence started after a report of a kidnapping. “While the preliminary investigation was underway, residents mobilised, allegedly fuelled by unsupported social media reports.” Major-General Anna Mateise praised police and residents for finding the teenager. “But I strongly condemn acts of violence. Vigilantism is not an answer to any situation.”
