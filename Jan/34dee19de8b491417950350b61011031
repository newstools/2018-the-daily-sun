Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said they were continuing with operations and had confiscated many cigarettes and arrested suspects.“We appeal to the public to work with us and inform the police about illegal traders, because we know illegal cigarettes are being sold to the community.”
