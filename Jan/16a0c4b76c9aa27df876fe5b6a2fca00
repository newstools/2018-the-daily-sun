Testifying at the Life Esidimeni Arbitration in Parktown, Joburg, yesterday was responding to statements made by former Gauteng health MEC Qedani Mahlangu and other senior officials. They said they tried to save costs because they were under financial pressure from Treasury.Regarding the massive spending on consultants, Creecy said she was not in a position to justify the amounts as she didn’t have the documents with her.This was after Advocate Adila Hassim of Section27 argued that millions were spent on consultants.Hassim said over R60 million was spent in a period of 10 months on consultants.“R300 000 a day seems outrageous,” said Hassim.Creecy said the health department had no reason to terminate its contract with the Life Esidimeni Group because there was more than enough money to keep the agreement going.Creecy said Mahlangu and the former head of department, Dr Barney Selebano, gave her the impression that the aim was to provide the same service provided by Esidimeni but in state institutions.“There was no mention of patients being moved to NGOs,” said Creecy.She said that Treasury made it clear what should be targeted to cut costs and the areas where these costs should be cut did not include core services.It also emerged that the health department was under administration as it owed R4,5 billion to service providers supplying goods and services to central hospitals.Creecy said management was not clear what the budget allocation was, and it was unclear whether anyone was held accountable for the mismanagement of funds.Creecy apologised to the grieving families.She said: “I am filled with as deep sense of shame that I was part of this government when this tragedy happened.”Gauteng Premier David Makhura, who also took the witness stand, said there had been a lot of blame shifting and excuses made, but the government was responsible for the deaths of the patients.
