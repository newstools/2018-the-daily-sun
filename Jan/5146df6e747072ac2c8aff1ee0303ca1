He had friends throughout Africa and he had friends all over the world,” she said.“The world has shown us how much they loved him. To him everyone was a family. We had cousins in every corner of his life.”Fans, celebrities, friends and family have made this the weekend of Bra Hugh Masekela.Among the many people who attended the Bra Hugh Masekela Memorial Service at the hall of the UJ Soweto Campus were Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa, Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete and Gauteng MEC for Sports, Arts and Culture Faith Mazibuko.Lifelong friends such as musician Abigail Kubeka and poet and author Don Mattera were among the many artists at the event.Nathi Mthethwa said he would remember Bra Hugh for his love of Africa.“He loved his roots.“He understood his stature,” said the minister.At a service in Alexandra, Joburg, on Friday Jonas Gwangwa said they had earned peanuts when they first formed a band.“But our burning passion kept us going until we cracked it in the mainstream,” he said.Caiphus Semenya said he had performed with Bra Hugh all over the country before they went to America.“Masekela could do everything with distinction,” he said.Don Mattera said: “Masekela was a little Jesus in the lives of many.”Bra Sam Mhangwani said Bra Hugh and Gwangwa gave him a chance: “They believed in me and I thank them all.”Dorothy Masuka said she was already performing when he was still in school.“But he grew up to be a global giant,” she said.A message from Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya’s president, read at the memorial said: “Hugh Masekela gave the world a reason to dance through his songs.”Masekela died last Tuesday after a long battle with cancer.According to an article in Sunday Sun he was cremated at a secret function on Friday. The paper reported that according to a close friend the cremation was in line with the trumpeter’s final wishes.
