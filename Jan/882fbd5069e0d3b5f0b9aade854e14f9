AJAX Cape Town coach Muhsin Ertugral has extended an olive branch to Benni McCarthy to do away with any potential animosity.Emotions boiled over on the sidelines of the Ikapa derby at the weekend, leading to a verbal altercation between Ertugral and his Cape Town City counterpart, McCarthy.His comments afterwards about McCarthy being a “baby” didn’t help the situation either.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstJaS2Gb_WM9tZuEWXbD17rHXX8xVBKIkJCAuaTp4roXkeBU20wcuNBj-cNaEBR0qxyfaElaASjGeGS3OtvhSnHV1SlZK9K20ZBtQCBnII5segxXeo8zzKctPbyakehA05DetjB1cRTRlyoLnwi25Coy9WgKBsCs86uRYd8RNLJbokF3OZrSFCoy7ODDhAL52Z5SBxRqO4G4PZAGj_On8XRrl4OHGpg2SR8vGr733ZYmX97KIrEOyDSAiEPtr0SmpOTfZgayUYGbL0AHDWbp6sNag\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzD693xlEYsmCEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I actually told John (Comitis) it was a great decision when he brought him in as a coach,” said Ertugral.“I’ll surely sit down with him for a chat. He needs to learn to be calm – I know what it’s like in that position. I was like him when I was young. “But for him to come out like that and accuse me of bullying the referee was uncalled for. The fact is there were 12 men on the pitch – as a coach I have the right to inform the ref.“I’m not a person who holds a grudge and I’ll be happy to meet with him and talk. Football is about emotions. I’m emotional too. “But after the 90 minutes it’s all over. It’s on the field, it’s done.”Ertugral, however, would do well to focus on the relegation trouble ahead.Despite roping in some fresh faces, including former Orlando Pirates striker Tendai Ndoro and Mamelodi Sundowns’ Yannick Zakri, Ajax haven’t quite turned the corner.Winless in their last four matches, the Urban Warriors are still trapped in the relegation quicksand with 16 points from 18 matches. They host the unpredictable Free State Stars at Cape Town Stadium on Friday, mindful of the fact that they can’t keep dropping points at home.Ea Lla Koto have been transformed into a formidable force under Luc Eymael and are no longer minnows who succumb to PSL heavyweights.“Things aren’t looking good,” admitted Ertugral.“The boys are doing well, but we still need time to rebuild this team. Unfortunately we don’t have time. We need to get out of relegation trouble. After that we can work to consolidate our position higher up in the standings.”
