BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic Ladies FC striker Melinda Kgadiete is itching to make her Banyana Banyana debut when they play two matches against Sweden this week.Banyana will play Sweden behind closed doors on Thursday, before a full international friendly three days later at the Cape Town Stadium (2pm). This is a match that will give Banyana’s interim coach, Desiree Ellis, a chance to see where she needs to reinforce in her squad before this year’s Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (Women’s Afcon) qualifier in Ghana.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssGIDK-YJGl2DMwll0kkEv5YaWrfOqgo-YaN_0QAe6-v4OAi4wzubmC6bRMvYs2zaB9wQgz2xN0NLUXYIASli2gBUAD9cwwV8QGpV2WS3Kpc4x4YEvE679Zdf96a2PBeJ31KGAGfhIMPooC6smESLQwhBNkqfqqW8DuJzL93RzUrb1QGTQJFvIt7FSnYa2TxIc2l3ipWEbeyKdeFARH9UdSZ1jGnqW4pk8nA42rAit1lGZ69AwyiLCM1UgG_2JfWMLahaKnslzOLWPuPsT2\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCqFSVc0MlvmEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I must make it count. I’ve always had a dream of playing for my country, and now it is about to come true. I will play to be remembered. I am obviously nervous, but looking forward to the challenge. “The best debut will be winning both games. I know it’s never easy but with the hardworking teammates I have, we can do it.“There’s always pressure to bring out the best in yourself. But I’m going to learn a lot from experienced players such as Leandra Smeda and Jermaine (Seoposenwe).
