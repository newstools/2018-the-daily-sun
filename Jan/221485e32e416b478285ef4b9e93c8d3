I must make it count. I’ve always had a dream of playing for my country, and now it is about to come true. I will play to be remembered. I am obviously nervous, but looking forward to the challenge. “The best debut will be winning both games. I know it’s never easy but with the hardworking teammates I have, we can do it.“There’s always pressure to bring out the best in yourself. But I’m going to learn a lot from experienced players such as Leandra Smeda and Jermaine (Seoposenwe).
