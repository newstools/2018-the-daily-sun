Police intervened but the attacker turned on them. “Police shot at him in self-defence,” he said. The attacker was declared dead at the scene while his victim was taken to hospital. Makhubele said more than 900 suspects were arrested for crimes ranging from driving while under the influence of alcohol to assault, possession of drugs, theft, robbery and malicious damage to property.“We will intensify deployments to concentrate on the opening of schools and universities, as fraudsters are known to target tertiary institutions during registration periods,” said Makhubele.He warned students and parents to avoid carrying large sums of cash. “Online applications and registrations should be considered as a safer option,” he said.
