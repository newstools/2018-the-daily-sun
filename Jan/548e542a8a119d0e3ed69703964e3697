Sadly, some were at the beach or visiting friends or family when the fire started. Yesterday residents were clearing the site looking for materials they could salvage and use to rebuild their shacks.Resident Lwando Jack (37) said he lived with his mother and was home when the fire started. He managed to rescue the man trapped in his shack at the source of the fire.“The fire spread fast due to strong winds. We use gas so it just made the fire worse,” said Lwando.“I just ran to my shack to grab our ID documents. Everything else is gone,” he added.Councillor Boy Boy Kalani said the Buffalo City Metro was still in talks with the Eastern Cape department of human settlements regarding temporary houses for the fire victims. Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Hazel Mqala said a case of arson has been opened.
