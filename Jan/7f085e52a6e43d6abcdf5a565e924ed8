She had tummy pains for a few years and then about five weeks ago, a scan showed she had a tumour.“We have been going to the doctors since 2014 as she has lost a lot of weight and had bad pains in her side but it was always passed off and she was given paracetamol.“She died during the operation but before she went in for the operation I told her I loved her and that I would see her later.“When they told me I was in shock and my head went into a spin. You could see they were upset but they did all they could. “It is a shock. Ellie was out on Christmas Eve with her friends.”According to Emma, doctors said it was likely that the growth in Ellie’s tummy would have killed her in the next few months anyway.Her mum is at least grateful that Ellie hardly suffered and had no time at all to stress about her deadly illness.Many friends of the teenager paid tribute to her on social media.
