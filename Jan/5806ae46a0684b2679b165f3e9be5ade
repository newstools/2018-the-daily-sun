Perhaps the most calamitous was a miskick from Denis Onyango, but no harm came of it.Chiefs were presented with a golden opportunity at the other end eight minutes later, but Willard Katsande headed over the crossbar from close range. In the end, nothing could separate the two sides.SaturdayPlatinum Stars 0 – 2 Orlando PiratesPolokwane City 0 – 0 AmaZulu SuperSport United 1 – 4 Bidvest WitsKaizer Chiefs 0 - 0 Mamelodi Sundowns
