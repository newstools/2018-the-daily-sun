    THE driver of a blue Volkswagen Citi Golf had a higher power on his side when he narrowly escaped death in a terrible accident on Wednesday. The car crashed into a guard rail which smashed through the windscreen, ripping out the boot of the vehicle and missing the driver’s chest by inches. Witnesses on Monument Road in Bloemfontein were shocked that the driver managed to survive the accident, which happened just before 8am. People advised the driver, who was covered in blood, to wait for an ambulance as he tried to crawl out of the vehicle through a window. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuDqhBH2B87zfmxxk-EakX96Wve4hkcNvvLBMeQUtmZMSCbIduUeaJIrIsFQihuAZw4xQ1u7O3RUNG57fbHKTzK_VAUsv38ueZrvl18QR0Av4rkQhFDnRSeN8jA6Kp1aLjKDQa3eoOux4_4V5MyorwKPBia2ZShP1qhn1wXCQnaUEdBb5G5Uaiyo7KO2QF1z9tEmFBwmuVUiVujw2nyWcQ5MRsUUflgqyfEPhlctYbm0w8VX67GaUsUXGzws8rUQcnlUUlKln5nlhTrKiQwG2bai63iAO8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOKe62yPzAVlEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It should have hit him hard and penetrated his upper body before going through the back window. “The only way to explain his survival is that his body disappeared and reappeared right after the crash. It’s really amazing and shows that angels of mercy do exist.” Thapelo Sinakgomo (27) said the accident reminded him of former Orlando Pirates star Rooi Mahamutsa’s crash. “I read about Rooi’s crash on the front page of Daily Sun in 2014. Just like Rooi, this man cheated death. It’s a real miracle,” he said. ER24 and a fire truck were soon on the scene to help the driver out of the car and take him to hospital. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sinah Mpakane said the 22-year-old driver was alone at the time of the crash. “A case of reckless and negligent driving was opened at Parkweg cop shop. The driver was badly injured and trapped in the car after the accident.”
