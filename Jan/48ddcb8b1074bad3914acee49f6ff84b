FOLLOWING the North Gauteng High Court ordering Brian Molefe
to pay back the R11 million he received from Eskom, he might face criminal
charges.Speaking to Fin24, trade union Solidarity chief executive
Dirk Hermann said the next step for the union would be to pursue criminal
charges against Molefe.A full bench at the North Gauteng High Court found that
Molefe was never entitled to the pension money.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstuYSdL0QZwIMZBYKYw-00skUVRIiwWaU_FRC0KVDl8Qlx0isB756gtjrWcQVawe1xICZHsoi1wyJezSDY6Bnz4weWlvHmmPXSrVqFWPfVMytRw5UUtMI3BgbtKORiFrNPWupzQX8FYoV1Dd1IdWPsW94nPE-MmE3QUj1CAVDy5U72jKGa6nOstgGmK-g8Xw8usexC45L8c6mstFahTWcKOpEech7HMdsFSH2N9DcxFBLS-BGUK2StyVdI-EL1QD03dTrBCPXpMpyKcDY8rN5yRKLL0r48\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzN7WsS3cAM_mEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

was false.Molefe received the alleged pension fund money in 2016, when
he left Eskom after he was implicated by then-public protector Thuli Madonsela
in suspicious deals between the power utility and the Gupta family.Anton van der Bijl, head of Solidarity’s Centre for Fair
Labour Practices said on Wednesday that Molefe acted unlawfully and was in no way
within the framework of Eskom’s pension and provident fund.Solidarity approached the high court on November 29 2017 to
declare Molefe's controversial pension award of about R30m, as well as the more
than R10m already paid out to him, unlawful.Molefe’s laywer Barry Farber said the ruling came down like
a ton of bricks, adding that Molefe would be disappointed with it.
