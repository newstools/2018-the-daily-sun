A NEW way to “naturally grow” bigger 4-5s may soon be
offered by a British company.According to The
Sun, StemProtect in Nottingham, England is boasting about using a technique
currently used to boost women’s boobs and tighten their bums.The technique involves taking fat from the tummy, and
enriching it in a lab. The lab process increases the number of stem cells in
the fat. Stem cells are extra powerful life-giving cells.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvQy7xrSawNstRPR9SiT-jx6rZsNXBFHO44UB15EpwUPf7ZIJpIFDW6XK04kl3ptp-0YaObH1DKgrtZhFohoVRScceAEU3-n4I0FV_I_FFCYDVkOSFXXezbmof1nJ2r7M0aj54_PDSfuCafx_ntHkvxycXRQv0MAongWCfiuMDabiD1yaza_0QOw96IEUakZ_mgfx2HDnKW9EDDW8MMiWC8xtC0XWBwSvBseIiDaxOOZQNZ888f7en_GD3PeMUJH-Tmr3qDuGmEPlbWYpvtlUyIB3DmoCTbzvaoyg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNXN0vOWOMTWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

4-5. The more fat that’s injected, the bigger the result.It is hoped that the result will be natural-looking and
long lasting.It is also thought to be a healthier alternative to
procedures that use silicone or artificial fillers.Mark Hall, from StemProtect, a stem cell bank, is quoted
in the report as saying: “We’re entering a new age of cosmetic surgery.“People are now very aware that natural is better, but at
the same time they want to improve their appearance wherever they can.South African men will have to do a whole lot of saving.
Besides the expense of travelling to England, they will have to fork out about £5
000 for the procedure – about R84 500.
