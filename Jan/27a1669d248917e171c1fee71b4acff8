The scheme includes Kouga Dam and the downstream canal system.According to Van Lingen, in July the department of water and sanitation reduced the towns’ maximum withdrawal for use by 25% because of the ongoing drought.“What has made the decrease particularly challenging is that even under normal rainfall conditions, these allocations have been insufficient in the past.“We will be pumping water from the Klein River to the Hankey treatment plant. “If necessary, water will also be trucked in.“These measures, however, might not be enough. We also need residents and business owners to play their part. “Please use water sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.”Resident Chamu Maneli (46) said: “I have stopped watering my vegetable garden because there is not enough water in the taps.”
