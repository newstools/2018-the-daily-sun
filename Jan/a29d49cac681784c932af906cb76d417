black business by top government officials such as the Director General
Mogokare Sekese of the Department of Public Enterprises and National Treasury’s
Dondo Mogajane. We encourage SOE’s (state-owned enterprises) and government
departments to follow suit” he said. “The winds of change

are keeping our hopes alive that we shall realize RET (radical economic
transformation) in our lifetime,” said Rasethaba.  The BBC also wants the new board to be given timelines to

executive team at Eskom, addressing Eskom’s going concern and to “get rid” of
those executives under investigation for corrupt activities.“This is one of many opportunities to place South Africa
back on the path of economic growth and job creation,” he said.  “Government will need to provide clarity on what immediate
actions it plans to take to re-establish both domestic and international
confidence in South Africa as an investment destination,” Coovadia added.He also believes the new board would help restore confidence
