Living here is torture,” she said. “We vote each time there’s an election, hoping that our lives will change.”Wellington Zwane (52) told Daily Sun his room was struck by fire twice.“Electricity was only installed last year,” he said. “Previously, we got electricity through izinyoka. The wires caused my room to catch fire twice in 2012.” Councillor Sibongile Khanyile, who only started in the position in 2016, told the People’s Paper: “I know residents of transit camps have issues, but I can assure them that the municipality is dealing with them. As a councillor I will never forget about them and their concerns.”Khanyile said a housing project in Cornubia will cater for people living in transit camps.And municipal spokeswoman Princess Nkabane told Daily Sun she has asked the housing department to check why the transit camp people have had to wait such a long time for RDPs.
