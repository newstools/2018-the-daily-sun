The suspects were charged with dealing in drugs, failing to safeguard firearms, assault, crimen injuria and resisting arrest.After being briefed, Mbalula visited the house where the suspects were arrested. When Mbalula arrived, a 19-year-old woman who is believed to be the daughter of a man and woman who were arrested, was also found in possession of drugs and was immediately arrested. Speaking outside the house, Mbalula said it was clear that the people living there were well known key people in terms of drug distribution in the area. He said kingpins and their dealers would be brought down. “The daughter was continuing with selling the drugs. Cops should stop arresting the drug users and they should focus on the sellers,” said Mbalula. He then went to the Durban CBD, where they raided a building and found 26 hobos.The hobos were taken to the cop shop to be screened to see if they could be linked to any crimes.“Those who need help will be attended to by the KZN Department of Social Development,” he said.Mbalula wrapped up his activities at the Police Day celebration in Hammarsdale, west of Durban.
