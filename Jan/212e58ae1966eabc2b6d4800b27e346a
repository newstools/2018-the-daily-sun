SUSPENDED Gauteng mental health director Makgabo Manamela resigned yesterday.She is the second health official to resign because of the Life Esidimeni tragedy.It claimed the lives of 143 psychiatric patients in Gauteng.Last year Manamela blamed the tragedy on a number of factors and said her department alone shouldnâ€™t take the fall.At the arbitration hearing in Parktown, Joburg, she claimed she still believed she was right to issue operating licences to the NGOs who received the patients.The hearing was set up last year, with former deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke chairing it, to get to the bottom of how 140 mentally ill patients died after being moved to under-resourced NGOs.It continues today.The tragedy happened after the Gauteng Health Department ended its contract with Life Esidimeni, which was caring for over 1 700 patients.The long awaited testimony of former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu is expected to be heard in coming weeks. She is one of three key witnesses, with former mental health care unit director Makgabo Manamela and former health department head Barney Selebano, who testified last year.Selebano resigned earlier this week after taking responsibility for the tragedy.But he and others said they were under pressure from Mahlangu to move patients as quickly as possible. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstbsHwvb9bnpt2MnAYHptz_bcqjL7XGCF187cMXEzJ_vSioUhM-ILVDJOmYkeeMFVYBIqeYRPm6lvyXN08XoVhsUMhxdEXvom_S0j7dWxUS3brAySFrm986TQYJkRrydnf4Sb1LKCRx-IKJDv1HPAvilV_75sVTm8CP34B9QbdTfWhslEGHBoLMwt6qwd0Vg9p3wWudvuqS0DaytrRLFw1YsSvJtWnYqoy6H6-Eb613WoiCYrmji0wb3aJzhlPWT4NY2BBKzrQtt2ixSExrrU-q1Pv6uuQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzE2w9JKL1sVPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
