WILL President Jacob Zuma exit the Union Buildings willingly to save himself the embarrassment of being pushed, or will he hold on to the bitter end?This is the million dollar question as the move for his exit grows stronger daily. Reports suggested the party’s newly elected top six used its visit to KZN at the weekend to convince Zuma’s support base that letting him go was good for the party. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssAoC6uuebSVlQFLXcpa1KgjYSMXN9NuRCKVDlpq_zG2NY5pGWqOyKWMeEJ9LYOlltQ1WHxseJO66yoF6Znn-O8ZKkuSNzqx86oVhU2rIVNhbFeFbKuLAuygdESnqKJoGMzmwOhygZh-E5qVlKYNR93aQ0e8X730qEkEKKo8bTb5uAAGnMLZw7vBKNWrRbuBkPm0xSGbNI8_6cfJ4qDGXCCs7UlEFsfDlyYUPq0_isKv0QKpuG2IT0LLimWF3-ylPhXZ05IFtXewi4TuC4oESepJIlRf9Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGD9KHxl8aRlEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

City Press yesterday reported that Zuma’s backers are planning for Ramaphosa to take over the reins in the next few weeks. They allegedly even want him to deliver the State of the Nation address in February.The paper reported fears that an immediate takeover might backfire among structures and provinces that supported Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. However, the senior member who spoke to Daily Sun said Zuma’s supporters, especially in the NEC, are concerned about their political future. “These are careerists who are more worried about themselves.”The NEC is set to meet this week before the ANC’s 106th anniversary celebrations. The removal of Zuma is said to be on the agenda.
