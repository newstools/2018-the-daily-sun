I grew up next to her and she used to send me to run errands for her.” He asked local businesses and organisations to help make gogo’s party possible. Grandchild Nomthandazo Motaung (27) said although gogo cannot see properly these days, she believes she was happy with the celebration.“To see her living to this age makes us very happy.” Bishop Tsietsi Makiti of Gabola church said they were happy to have been invited.“As residents of Orange Farm, we were invited to celebrate her special day. “We wish her many more years and believe God will bless her,” he said.
