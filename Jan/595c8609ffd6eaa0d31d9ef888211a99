    ODIRILE Makwati wishes people would stop saying bad things about animals. The 34-year-old from Zweletemba outside Worcester, Western Cape told Daily Sun it made him very sad when people said animals, which were created by God, were used for evil deeds. “Why is it acceptable for white people to keep animals in their homes but when a black person does it, people have issues? That needs to stop,” he said. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuQdELlhPF-ct_YtDZjr3W21051CdDiWNJgt-cENf9SHBAz6CtAeay-mKJyzhfXo87f1_QEZGb8W2fw7kwZCKOI7c64Nv7j94mnJ_tbFq7j9nQYdyUyIIUW6SOp80WoV3i75A8rizH7UYZviYIuLuaQya__Rl6V3SkdGZafaVJ-rRzQq8KsN-7Fv_LZ-wOWeXRe573UXyDjRNbPA9yvlxNowwjDOQdQ99QbrohjLJD5_wHWpC64zaksfT3avud5N1rSnJ7zfoAYL4cPGUyZXL9yN97T1Ps\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNpkMEaGoc-LEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

My friends liked eating birds but I wanted to keep them and fed them. “I bought myself two doves in 2011 and they lived in the house at first. Later, I built them a nest outside the house because I wanted them to fly free.” Odirile said his birds tell him when something is wrong. “At night, they make sounds on the roof when a tragedy is about to happen. I wake up and pray for things to pass. Some people accuse me of witchcraft because when I leave the house, one dove stands at the gate waiting for me to come back,” he said.He said people have offered to buy his doves but they are not for sale, because they are like his babies. Odirile said his dream is to retire to the Eastern Cape with more than 100 doves.
