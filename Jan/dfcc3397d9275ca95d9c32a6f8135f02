He also has three ambulances. “I had this idea last year and quickly found a site. I’m happy the hospital is operating. “I divide patients according to their gender and illnesses. I heal illnesses like persistent feet and ankle swelling, piles, hallucinations and so forth.”Nkomonde said he was still planning to sort out registration with the Department of Health.“I am a traditional healer registered under the Traditional Healers Council,” he said. Resident Ntombi Makhathini (42) praised the hospital.Traditional Healers Council president Sazi Mhlongo said: “We do not want what happened at Life Esidimeni in Joburg to repeat itself in our province. “The department has to know about this place and give approval. Nkomonde may be a member of our council, but his facility has to be registered separately with us.”KZN health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said the department would comment once it had gathered all the facts.
