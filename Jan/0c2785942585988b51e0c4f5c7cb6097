I would wait for them to go to sleep and then start studying.” In the morning, she would wake up early before everyone else and revise again.“That became part of my life and I got used to it.” Life has been difficult for them at home. Her father died while she was still young.“But I didn’t want to let that stop me from succeeding. I wanted to be the one to bring change to my family and take us to a new level,” she said.Esther’s mother, Puleng Shuping (48), said: “I’ve never seen someone work so hard. My girl wanted this and she got it.”Puleng said it confirms that if one wants to achieve something, no matter what the obstacle, it can be achieved as long as there is enough dedication and perseverance.
