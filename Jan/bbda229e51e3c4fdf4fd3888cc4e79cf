He was admitted to hospital and discharged the following day.He died at Langa Police Station when he went to open a case on 2 January. “The hospital discharged him, even though he was in bad shape,” he said. “They even said he might not make it because his injuries were bad. “We tried to open a case on his behalf while he was still alive, but cops told us to bring him in person. “When we went back we were told to wait as the detectives were in a meeting. “My brother went outside to the toilet and died on his way back without having opened the case.”Mlamli said the post mortem results stated that Madoda died as a result of lung failure.“My brother didn’t smoke or drink. He was perfectly fine before he was attacked,” he said. “We were so surprised to see one of the women’s Facebook status. “It read: ‘he didn’t die because of us but because of lung failure’. How do they know the results?”Western Cape Emergency Medical and Forensic Pathology Services spokesman Robert Daniels said: “We are not at liberty to divulge or discuss the findings.”Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana told Daily Sun: “Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.”
