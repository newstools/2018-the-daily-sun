The people didn’t know where the parents went to, as they are both unemployed. Police spokeswoman Captain Namhla Mdleleni told Daily Sun that cops found the two children locked in the shack. “They were both very hungry. “A cop broke the lock on the security gate to get to the children. “They were taken to the victim support centre at Queenstown Police Station. “They were cleaned and fed with the help of social workers.“Both children are in good health and are in a place of safety,” said Mdleleni. She said the father was arrested in Queenstown on Thursday and his wife handed herself over to the police later the same day.The parents, aged 35 and 30, spent the weekend in police custody. They will appear in court today on a charge of child neglect.
