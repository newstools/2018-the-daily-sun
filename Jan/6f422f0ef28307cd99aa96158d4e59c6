investigation by the IPID which uncovered that contrary to the version of the
officers that they were shot at, they, in fact, killed the deceased and staged
the crime scene to cover their tracks," Dlamini said.The investigator was commended by IPID executive
director Robert McBride."Police [officers] are expected to act within
the bounds of the Constitution and the laws of our country. This case shows
that tampering with evidence will not protect those who should be held
accountable from their responsibility."Nare 'very brave'Author and journalist Julian Rademeyer at the time
of Nare's death wrote in Zimbabwe Digital News that the freelance journalist
had worked with him as a fixer, during research for a chapter of his book,
Killing for Profit. He said Nare had also helped him gain access to a gang of
cigarette smugglers operating in Musina. Rademeyer said Nare had also worked for the BBC, Al
Jazeera, the New York Times, the SABC's Special Assignment, eNCA and Deutsche
Welle.Jacques Pauw, author of The President's Keepers,
described the late Nare as "very brave"."He was kind of like a one-man show. He would
go where others won't dare to tread," Pauw told News24.He said that Nare had served ten years in prison
for armed robbery and when he came out he wanted to start afresh and educate
himself. He approached Pauw when he was still with Special Assignment and said
he wanted to turn his life around, and asked for a chance to work with him.Nare had access to zama zamas, rhino smugglers and
bank robbers because of his past, and was "absolutely fantastic", he
said.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/3-joburg-metro-cops-arrested-for-murder-of-journalist-godknows-nare-20180125
