    ARSENAL midfielder Jack Wilshere sustained an ankle injury during Wednesday’s goalless draw with Chelsea in the first leg of the League Cup semi-final and is doubtful fr Sunday’s Premier League trip to Bournemouth, manager Arsene Wenger said.The England international appeared to have finally overcome an extended period of injury frustration by starting Arsenal’s last six league games and captaining the side at Stamford Bridge, but was substituted in the second half.Wenger rued his side’s injury woes in midfield as Wilshere joined playmakers Aaron Ramsey (hamstring) and Mesut Ozil (knee) along with long-term absentee Santi Cazorla on the sidelines.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Soccer6/Landing&sz=300x250&c=822701368&t=artid%3dd6282fe1-0778-4109-8ee1-b77791f276b5%26accreditation%3dreuters%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Soccer6/Landing&sz=300x250&c=822701368&t=artid%3dd6282fe1-0778-4109-8ee1-b77791f276b5%26accreditation%3dreuters%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>“I don’t know if he’ll be available today, but it’s definitely an ankle sprain,” Wenger told reporters after the match.“At the moment, we have five big injuries and we’re hoping to get some players back. The earliest to come back is Ramsey and that’s quite welcome because it’s an area we’re a bit short.“If we didn’t lose Jack tonight then we would have had Ramsey back and then maybe Ozil on today, but we could look a bit short.”German international Ozil, who is out of contract at the end of the season, has missed Arsenal’s two cup games this month amid increasing speculation about his future at the Emirates.Ramsey last played in Arsenal’s league draw with Southampton on 10 December.Arsenal, who are sixth in the table, travel to Bournemouth and host Crystal Palace in the league before the second leg of the League Cup semi-final on 24 January.) Meanwhile, Wenger has revealed that his midfielder Francis Coquelin is set to join Valencia. Coquelin had been linked to the La Liga side before the January transfer window opened after making only one Premier League appearance for Arsenal this season.The 26-year-old Frenchman was also reported to have attracted interest from West Ham and Crystal Palace as Wilshere’s return to prominence with Arsenal blocked Coquelin’s chances of a recall.Having been left out of Arsenal’s team for Wednesday’s match, Wenger confirmed Coquelin would move to Spain.“He goes to Valencia. He didn’t get enough games for us this season. He had an opportunity and I let him go,” Wenger said.  – Reuters/AFP
