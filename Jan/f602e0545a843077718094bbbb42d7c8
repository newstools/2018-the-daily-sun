We must remain humble and my philosophy is to take it one game at a time.”Eymael has no mandate other than to make sure Stars are not in another relegation dogfight, and said a top eight finish would be a bonus. But he stressed there is no pressure on him or the players.Said Eymael: “Last season the club avoided the relegation play-offs on goal difference. Finishing in the top eight this season would be fantastic. But first I’m looking for another three points to get over that 30 point mark that will see us safe.”Stars are on 28 points and clubs see 30 points as the safety mark to avoid being relegated.He praised his players: “To do well a club must have good players, a good mentality and good fighting spirit. It’s all coming together,.” Eymael has been like a breath of fresh air to Stars who have been struggling against the relegation axe for the past number of seasons.But all that has changed under Eymael who is expecting a tough battle against the Team of Choice at Goble Park on Saturday (3.30pm).Said Eymael: “We beat Maritzburg 1-0 in the first round. But despite winning, Maritzburg impressed me. They have a very good coach (Fadlu Davids) and good players. So we need to stay focused.”
