It must be something that all parties agree to and not just what one person says," he said."We must have reforms in order for those elections to be free, fair and credible in line with the constitution. Reforms are fundamental otherwise that election can't be possible and we can't have that," Chamisa added.According to the constitution, Zimbabwe can hold elections between July and August, however parliament can decide to dissolve itself, triggering an early vote.The opposition is pushing for the Electoral Act to be aligned with the constitution, which would allow postal voting and the appointment of an independent election commission.The MDC also demands equal access to a register of voters.During elections in 2013, the electoral commission's refusal for MDC to access the electronic voter roll led to a court dispute and the MDC's boycotting of subsequent by-elections.Since the rise of the MDC in 2000, elections in Zimbabwe have been marred by political violence as well as allegations of bias by state institutions, as well as vote rigging.With tensions at their peak in 2008, almost 200 opposition supporters died during the presidential poll.The political crisis led to the MDC, the ruling Zanu-PF, and other parties forming a coalition government.NEWS24
