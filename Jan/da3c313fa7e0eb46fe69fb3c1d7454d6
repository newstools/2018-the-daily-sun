    THE family of Joseph Ngale have been desperately looking for him and his son since Christmas Eve. Joseph (57) from Soshanguve extension 14, Tshwane, and his son Lebogang Khoza (10) were last seen on Sunday morning. Joseph’s partner, Johanna Khoza (40), said he took their son to buy Christmas clothes and never returned. When she called him on his two cellphones, he didn’t answer. “I kept on calling until midnight and eventually both phones were switched off,” she said. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuzjxn7-t_9gRT0KS5aeb1C4LtgUuNJjgJ52FzEpfxTHGKRDjcLWvRBNwQgr0i0fAKtGRjhl3C1OumiY5o3yrMq1vjCvVnHR44eXO1r86hKtpSg8lDerkdf8lk5np73oCMEpoUf-9yf9iitNHB4EP3NKDrK3NjGkf_eFNgPoROi0RrWRBVkKUpad67avxZ25H5k-2C8NqKgnA8bLab7ILVaJPxWEzforujnQWJc3TLc6lFoXsEzMuuVXFg058JYFhvffUzSLEgiOO4oij6M1-5zqlqAhWo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzK5iei8vzqysEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Ga-Rankuwa police spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi advised Johanna to speak to the station commander. “If she was refused help, she can call me and I will see what I can do to assist,” he said.
