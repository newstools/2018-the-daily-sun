Reegan Dhanapal, the owner of the college, had a heated argument with Shaheeda Essack, the director of registrations for private higher education institutions. Dhanapal claimed his college offered international courses which were registered with the UK qualifications authority. “You cannot come to another country and open a business without proper registration and approval of that country. “So what you are doing here is unlawful,” said Essack.She warned that if the department visited the building again this week and found the college operating, the owner would be arrested and charged with fraud. She said the department launched an awareness campaign last week in North West and Gauteng and was now in KZN. Officials will go to the Eastern Cape soon. She warned the public against enrolling at fly-by-night colleges as they preyed on unsuspecting people, mainly from rural areas. She said they offered qualifications which would not be worth anything in the end because they were not recognised.
