In 2016, only one pupil failed and last year 220 pupils wrote the exam, with only two failures. The pupil who failed in 2016 has rewritten matric and passed, said principal Martha Ngoma, and the two pupils who failed are receiving support. “Pupils should know that failing matric is not the end of the world. “They should use all the options available to them and forget all the negativity,” she said. The principal added that her school is the envy of other kasi schools. She said the secret to achieving top marks was nothing other than hard work. “Put in the extra hours, work hard, involve parents and you will see the results.”Tshifhiwa Shonisani (18), who got five distinctions, told Daily Sun he never thought he’d be the school’s top pupil. “Our teachers are accessible and they don’t mind many questions. My mother and gogo also encouraged me,” he said. Tshifhiwa said he was going to study to be a chartered accountant at the University of Pretoria.Tshifhiwa’s mum, Rudzani, who is a teacher, said Tshifhiwa’s late dad must be proud. “He has honoured him,” she said.His gogo, Sarah (66), said her grandson had made the entire family proud.
