This opportunity is a sign that if I do well, I stand achance of being part of Banyana for the World Cup qualifier – and maybe even my first World Cup in France next year if we qualify,” said Dlamini.In order to avoid a repeat of what happened last year, Dlamini said she would need to have better communication with Banyana’s technical team so that there aren’t any complications this time.Coach Ellis has also rewarded some players that participated in the 2017 Sasol League National Championship staged in Nelspruit in December with a place in the squad. Those players include Yonelo Keto (Thunderbirds), Kgaelebane Mohlakoana, Melinda Kgadiete (both Bloemfontein Celtic), Neliswa Luthuli and Sduduzo Dlamini (both Sunflower FC).
