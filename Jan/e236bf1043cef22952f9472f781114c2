The Togolese signed an 18-month contract yesterday, the club’s general manager Lunga Sokhela confirmed on Tuesday.Said Sokhela: “Yes, I can confirm that we have finished signing him (Abraw). He is our player now.” The 27-year-old was first introduced to the Absa Premiership by Free State Stars in 2014 where he played only one season, before joining Amakhosi in 2015. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu_uskeZizpIl6elXT8I_n8U8Qndmz5RdYmVswzWy8ba5AXQ-4Gz35hUkibuufBhGtMTJOEksVwYcRjqBUt6oaTTV01wuIQl8L8Le426Hcr5jNmTGR2cbD_kClWorSBFt8A252KuvkKuuhwoT2k39kWWe-pnS0yc_4mzXZDYWLHMcwBNlskICC5-CAEWaI_3U9QH_jtKIj1SNe7CXzG6ROkiEY58UAQP4X00bgivHn3clWG0ikAfQFFNXCQevD6SixlUjWfeeO1feX9r4U6rFkVsQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHAHGCg9yJrWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We won’t do that because we are not in a crisis. “What the team is going through now is bigger than the coach. There are some issues that needs to be sorted within the team structures, and even if we can employ (Jose) Mourinho nothing will change.” Usuthu haven’t won in their last seven Absa Premiership matches, and the last time they won was back in October when they beat Mamelodi Sundowns 2-1.Their recent defeats saw them drop to 14th in the PSL log with 15 points after 15 matches – equal on points with Bidvest Wits and Platinum Stars in 16th position. On Saturday Johnson and his lads face SuperSport United at King Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi (3.30pm).
