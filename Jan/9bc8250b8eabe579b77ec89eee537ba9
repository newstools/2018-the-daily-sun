VIRAT Kohli was in full flight at Centurion on Monday morning, cruising to his 21st Test century on Day 3 of the second Test against the Proteas. This innings, the first century of the series, has been a masterclass from the Indian skipper that has given his side a chance of winning the Test and staying alive in the series. Kohli has been sublime, with his shot-making providing an exhibition for the small crowd in attendance. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvKV_P2PBye5L5AMesxeaQYY4ax4JmZrnTtjIUAXMHsXyK8qp_kvnCWzB4DGB7y2t5CzplyGAkiTwgAEkcTztJPda3ZUqWMKXw4assrZoo1HoUjkrEi-2KM3Bfi9MhDsdcT2WQIdMjGC_CAnSIc6BBN34JmzFGud75P7HGRk1OGoUefk8MucURCav2i9iF6yDbaXc6MGo5KTfs27zaVaRaoheIXuB_gDuzMTgaS_waz6sQ3fdFhdA1b5scnD-UmH-DzLce99kxc364919RE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKMWOGRfm1aWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
