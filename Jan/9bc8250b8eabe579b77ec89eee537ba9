VIRAT Kohli was in full flight at Centurion on Monday morning, cruising to his 21st Test century on Day 3 of the second Test against the Proteas. This innings, the first century of the series, has been a masterclass from the Indian skipper that has given his side a chance of winning the Test and staying alive in the series. Kohli has been sublime, with his shot-making providing an exhibition for the small crowd in attendance. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuvPR-COupaxvfI2FsHk9VwaP65Dt0MW631neWsTjwyYKDQHeCbjY7rSqwpvHsO92lcreUuA6xek2zTFL0nthDKiHUSIb-NYIHrVlrwDEXPVG75pfAcnKJa8_MKQ643SWSy8qZJ0kNG06XaK_wu2NZMLnciAmhK7tEZJgjiGnpfHFc4_XsGP68vW7S0c3RoeIU4NgdkOYy1JQR4yx_FBqvxq5emCCIj1vFjx4lMe9gxRE12ZqGj16cCZ-8nrvcSGxokwCKXIvsQ8TTkJsfo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIerEkAZwTHAEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
