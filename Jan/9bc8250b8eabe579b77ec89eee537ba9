VIRAT Kohli was in full flight at Centurion on Monday morning, cruising to his 21st Test century on Day 3 of the second Test against the Proteas. This innings, the first century of the series, has been a masterclass from the Indian skipper that has given his side a chance of winning the Test and staying alive in the series. Kohli has been sublime, with his shot-making providing an exhibition for the small crowd in attendance. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuQ9K-YJm1VgLIkiK5eCm7rqD_CbKsRubml-84CIOQ1ERaq90vnotQsh8ZhZbRS2e3gGs_6G697b1cA4INkhO4rEo3dVj0GP0tfevxYxMUUWsSSv7mxHzb-LFQ7Y9TVHveF-uzsL24bT2Yl1ig4CqRlk48X1OkNM8xrJN7eamVXfXdXhMGANR7jone8HpQHrpzCttpynMKpnyCTfBzuzD5nN_No2XhcdjHZ4ZmUN2sNLNDsFv2MXxKP1l1Ygj02U_YCMg2LgiYsuyvelUs_\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJ4Trx-a9--7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
