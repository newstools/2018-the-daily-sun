investigators'According
to IPID, Makhele, who was appointed to her acting position by Phahlane,
instructed her subordinates to lie to their investigators in an attempt to
cover up her involvement in the counter-investigation conducted by Crime
Intelligence and a North West investigative team led by Major General Ntebo
Mabula.She has
also been accused of procuring equipment to frustrate IPID’s investigation and
of authorising payment to private companies to spy on IPID, as well as
civilians involved in the Phahlane case.  In an
affidavit seen by News24, an IPID investigator stated that Makhele - along with
provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Baile Motswenyane - established the
North West team in order to "interfere with witnesses under false pretense
of (a) security breach"The IPID
investigator said he went to the Crime Intelligence boardroom to interview
Makhele and had called an officer to explain certain aspects behind documents
which were in dispute. As the officer started to explain the documents, Makhele
allegedly stood up and interrupted her and then left the room with her, the
investigator said.'Hiding
some evidence'He said he
then asked to interview the officer later and she told him that, when she stood
up, Makhele had winked at her and had told her not to say anything when they
were outside the boardroom."It
was clear that Major General Makhele was hiding some evidence in the matter, as
those letters in question have evidential value in the investigation," the
affidavit said.Footage of
the meeting also showed Makhele indicating with her finger that the officer
should not talk to IPID.For the
past year, IPID has been pursuing a case of corruption against Phahlane, focusing
on how he, a career police officer, could afford to build a house worth around
R8m.Allegations
of cash payments of at least R700 000 and money stuffed into plastic shopping
bags to pay builders, as well as questions around a number of vehicles that
were in his name, formed part of the probe.IPID
spokesperson Moses Dlamini said it is concerning that senior police officers
had attempted to interfere with a legitimate IPID investigation, in an effort
to shield Phahlane from being investigated for serious allegations of
corruption."Unfortunately,
she is not the only one, but the wheels of justice will catch up with all of
those involved," said Dlamini.The matter
against Makhele has been postponed to February 19.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/former-free-state-crime-intelligence-chief-arrested-for-covering-up-for-phahlane-20180111
