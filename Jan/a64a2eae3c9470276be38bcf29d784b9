WHILE most of his peers answer to the title of mkhulu, Hugh Masekela was still fondly referred to as Bra Hugh.The title of Bra is not easily bestowed on any Tom, Dick or Harry ekasi.And no one carried it better than the jazz legend who died yesterday.Bra Hugh battled prostate cancer since 2008, when he was first diagnosed.The Emalahleni-born musician’s music journey was started by apartheid activist and priest Father Trevor Huddleston, who encouraged him to play the trumpet.Letta Mbulu paid her respects at Bra Hugh’s home.
