ANC regional secretary Tholi Gwala said the party was shocked by Mlambo’s death.“It seems these hitmen are out to kill politicians all over the province, and are now targeting my region,” said Gwala, who visited the family yesterday. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said Mlambo was shot in the back while off-loading goods from the bakkie.“The suspect fled the scene in a getaway car. A case of murder is being investigated by Esikhaleni police,” said Mbhele.
