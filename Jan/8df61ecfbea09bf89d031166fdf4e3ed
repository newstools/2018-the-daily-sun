    THE DA in Limpopo is worried that some of the 44 328 pupils expected to write supplementary exams next month could miss out because they live far away from exam centres.Some pupils missed their exams completely, while others only have to write one or two subjects.The DA has accused the provincial education department of failing to provide transport for them. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst_VXaWSGgpjh0r6INSg6smu_-753OQSJDn4QJuNP8uI_2dyydtHFpCv3Ss1lVQaKX2vKx_xz-TbCkf-DdwmfXdYTOBLziKq99d9tF9nnWeV-JCT3w9bqFIZYamaypqwIUmqt8zlTeYEfawJoBARoSWyf82gboKMLqs7BJPSIL4k17jnAxm2b3yTXJkJ0lFSpp88RH3WjO0gF1shxwfjaI7KYEjIPYlabDjhzEEO-c2uPHM2ULvVjz5vaKpM9AKiQbg9PpQnGrYeU7ILFxRCtNHMHXE2oo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzB2c_vHyb3X1EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But education spokesman Sam Makondo told the People’s Paper: “Pupils always have been able to go to their respective centres because the department has scholar transport in place. “By February and March during supplementary exams, schools will be open and scholar transport in place for all qualifying pupils.“Pupils qualify according to October/November results to write supplementary exams but aren’t writing because they missed a certain exam.”
