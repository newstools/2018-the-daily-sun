But education spokesman Sam Makondo told the People’s Paper: “Pupils always have been able to go to their respective centres because the department has scholar transport in place. “By February and March during supplementary exams, schools will be open and scholar transport in place for all qualifying pupils.“Pupils qualify according to October/November results to write supplementary exams but aren’t writing because they missed a certain exam.”
