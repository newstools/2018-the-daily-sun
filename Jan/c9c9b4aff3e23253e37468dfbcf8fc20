That’s not on!Thabang was angry and wanted to take his matter straight to the high court, but Scorpion advised him it would first have to go to the magistrates court.But Thabang wanted to understand why because he thought the high court had more power than the magistrates court.What does the law say?

Specialised courts ensure the right cases go to the right court.Mzansi has the following courts: Constitutional Court – the highest court in the land, their decision is final and can’t be changed by another court.Supreme Court of Appeal – except for the ConCourt, this is the highest court and only deals with cases sent from high courts. Decisions can’t be changed by any other court, except if it’s a constitutional matter.High Courts – only hear cases too serious for the magistrates court, or appeals from them, or lower courts in their geographical jurisdiction.Magistrate Courts – deal with less serious criminal and civil cases, divided into regional and district courts.Labour Courts and Labour Appeal Courts – tackle labour disputes between employees and employers and are the highest courts for labour matters.Small Claims Courts – hear civil matters involving less than R15 000, except for divorces, wills, malicious prosecution, unfair arrest, seduction and breach of promise to marry.Specialist Courts include: Special Income Tax CourtsLand Claims CourtThe Water TribunalTruth and Reconciliation CommissionChild Justice CourtsMaintenance CourtsSexual Offences CourtsChildren’s CourtsCourts for Chiefs and HeadmenWhich court can help?
