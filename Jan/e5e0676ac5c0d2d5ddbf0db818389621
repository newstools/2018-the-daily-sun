Sundowns have accepted that Billiat will be leaving.”Our source said Downs were not happy with the way the player had messed them around, keeping them in suspense by refusing to renew his contract: “His tactics appear to have backfired, as he has not only wasted the club’s time but also his own – no PSL club has approached them with a view of obtaining his services.”The source said Billiat would have to move overseas to a rich Middle Eastern club, or somewhere in Europe to earn what he gets at the big-spending Chloorkop side.“Billiat earns a big salary. There is no club in this country that can match or beat what he earns with Downs. So the only way out for him is to go overseas.”Sundowns had no festive season break and were back at training on 27 December, preparing for their first league clash of 2018 against Polokwane City at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm).
