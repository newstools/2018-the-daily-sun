Eskom boss Sean Maritz, in which he stated that if Eskom wants to dismiss him,
it must follow the letter of the law.Koko faced a disciplinary hearing over allegedly not
declaring a conflict of interest while his stepdaughter Koketso Choma was a
director at Impulse International - a firm which benefited from about R1bn
worth of contracts awarded by Eskom over 11 months.WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
