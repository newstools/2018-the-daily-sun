The suspects got angry and pulled out firearms when they were told all three shacks were occupied.” The tenant said the lovers are unemployed.“They earn a living from the shacks they rent out. There is nothing valuable the thugs could have taken from the house.” Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said Nomfundo was wounded in the face and her partner in the hip. “The lovers were taken to Dora Nginza Hospital for medical treatment,” he said. Beetge said a case of attempted murder was opened at New Brighton Police Station, and asked the public to help police with information about the suspects. “Anyone with information should call Captain Jerome Mackay of Motherwell serious crimes unit on 076 018 0713.”Motherwell cluster commander Major-General Dawie Rabie said: “We will not rest until these callous suspects are arrested.”
