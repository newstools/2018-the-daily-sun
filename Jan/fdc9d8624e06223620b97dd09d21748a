He said some residents hadaccused others of being involved in evil practices and killing the girl.“Residents went on therampage and started pursuing one family, but police reacted swiftly,” he said. “The family is now under police protection. Members of the public order police have been deployed to the area to help stabilise the situation.”Mojapelo said after police had left, residents gathered and burned down the houses of four people they accused of beinginvolved in evil practices. “The houses that were burned belonged to the Maepa, Mampuru and Mojele families. All these families are residents of the village under Khoshi Thobejane,” he said.  Provincial police commissioner General Nneke Ledwabasaid: “Members of the community are warned to stop making accusations against others and resorting to attacks and destruction of property,” he said. “Those responsible will be hunted down and dealt with accordingly.”The suspects are due to appear in court soon.
