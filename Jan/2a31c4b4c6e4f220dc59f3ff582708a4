MMUSI Maimane is confident Capetonians will push Day Zero back. Speaking in Cape Town yesterday, the DA leader said Day Zero had been pushed back from 12 April to 16 April. “It may not seem like a lot but it’s a significant victory. It shows residents are coming together and cutting water consumption.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvwDvlIOpYXLhMntqODXzaPWYi8iLObF_aQJlVavYQ47HWFCd9v1amTyWPBLck5VfK-J3pwdxreARX8XM7I9GWeBu11eYnsl4G6M4fqrr-XSyA16oeUBpAHj_JkaYqfg69wEQYppgwZ1_U_RdW-oyEkaTO_epqrcbzR9LPhNZRJQ2FanLR4MbpYOSe2g6G3P4BpWM3yryC1SSYs07ROz7RpH7niXaTScS1QiuHuPlzdh2JPpT1z8OYoXZV-1lcA0if0_dVUBSzLTeAHVssnQx9aSMRRmXE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPQAUdvbi9dzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Flanked by Cape Town deputy mayor Ian Neilson, Councillor Xanthea Limberg and Western Cape party leader Bonginkosi Madikizela, Maimane said many residents have already begun to panic about the possibility of Day Zero and have begun hoarding municipal water. “It increases consumption and is counter-productive. “If we are clear about what we need to do and commit to it, we can defeat Day Zero completely. “We need residents, community and religious leaders, and the media to help us and not to contribute to any sense of panic.” Asked why he was leading the campaign, Maimane said it was because mayor Patricia de Lille had failed to spearhead the crisis.
