Mall of Africa general manager Johann Fourie said the H&M store would be closed until further notice. He confirmed the protest was being monitored and had been secured by mall security, Fidelity Security Services, and the police to ensure customer, staff and tenant safety. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstWYvGSIxvFcmP90YGkSO1G73Vq6zj0k81D0SNHcA8irVp9Xk2YkUiDbxnBgHYcu0CeXLpgRgsHWu32xmSyn5YMS_1PT5IW7JxhrHj3Gq_mTzpsXo47i_2g3LgkwaeAHFKh75hX0xgdkHMpjlPaiiuXmskIzD4qcWfKTfgPjDU1UQ6Uii7QnLt8EIlB1WFxmkXawfKdzo3WRL0eXPSlu6dcP6es0c3EHCX75RIOpKsMM6GwrLMdtSs5E6vaXq0PJ2yONlxJP1-1x1haOW0PXnIZPfzL6hU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzARRVNY-kIPKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

H&M has since apologised and removed the image as well as the sweater from retail, saying it was "investigating internally to ensure this canâ€™t ever happen again". Police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said mall operations were otherwise mostly continuing as normal."No violence has taken place so far. There has been no criminal activity," he told News24.A Mall of Africa store employee, who was standing near the protesters, said it was decided to close their doors as staff were "scared"."They are just singing but you never know [when the situation can change]," she said.Most shoppers were avoiding the area, she added.On Saturday, EFF supporters trashed stores in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town in response to the online ad.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mall-of-africa-tenants-close-up-shop-as-protesters-descend-on-hm-store-20180115
