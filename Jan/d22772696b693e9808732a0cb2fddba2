I played drums, sang and danced for them. That is how I learnt Zulu.” He said he became a sangoma after dreaming about the car guards at his work being beaten up by thugs. In his dream, he even saw what the tsotsis were wearing and where they had parked their cars. He was shocked when three days later, the incident from his dream happened in real life. He then consulted 15 sangomas before meeting gobela Nomsa Gumede, who told him he had healing powers and his ancestors lived in the water. Nomsa said Mamb’emhlophe’s ancestors told them to go to the river, and since then that is where he goes to connect with them. Mamb’emhlophe said he specialised in muthi for protection, removing spells and for stopping people sent to kill his clients. He has also released two albums, Iphalamende and Ingilosi, which featureIzingwe Zomhlaba. He said his daughter has followed in his footsteps and became a sangoma last year. “We got this calling from my father who used to hear the voices of the dead,” he said.
