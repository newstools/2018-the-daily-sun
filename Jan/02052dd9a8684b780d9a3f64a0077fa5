So far cops have arrested about seven people in connection with Metrorail vandalism. One suspected cable thief was electrocuted last week.Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott told the People’s Paper: “We have adopted a zero tolerance approach to crime and will fully co-operate with the police investigation. “The ongoing collaboration between the community, cops and rail agency has led to a number of arrests. “This is encouraging and sends out a strong message that criminals will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.”Western Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula praised the cops and their partners in fighting crime and ensuring the arrest of the suspect.
