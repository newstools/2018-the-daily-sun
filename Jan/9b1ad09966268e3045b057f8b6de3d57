A NIGERIAN housewife will have to give up her comfortable
lifestyle for a while after being found guilty of treating her domestic workers
as slaves.According to The
Daily Post, Gift Nonye Ukatu was handed a 13-year jail term on Monday by
the Lagos State High Court for the horrible way she treated the two girls who
worked at her house. Both are under 12 years old.The details of how exactly she abused the girls were not
reported, but she was bust by people who had seen how she used the girls for
forced labour and denied them freedoms.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>She was charged in December 2015 under the country’s
Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons law.Ukatu apparently tried to flee justice, jumping bail in
2016.But she was rearrested and her trial began in July that
year.She pleaded not guilty to the charges.A statement issued by the National Agency for the
Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons said Ukatu was “slammed with a six-count
charge of harbouring two girls that are under 12 years old and using them for
forced labour, domestic workers and treating them as slaves”.The 13 year sentence for the six charges will run
concurrently.Director-General of the agency, Julie Okah-Donli, said
that the judgement signalled the beginning of a crackdown on human traffickers
in Nigeria.
