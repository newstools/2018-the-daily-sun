DEPUTY President Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday said that policy certainty and fighting corruption would give investors confidence in South Africa.Ramaphosa was addressing a Pre-World Economic Forum breakfast gathering at the Hilton Hotel in Sandton before leading Team SA to the forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.He said he would be taking a message of unity to Davos to attract investors.“The key message is policy certainty across all platforms. We want to make SA an attractive domain or country by addressing those issues that stand in the way of investment,” he said. “Yes, we are all going to sell SA and increase investor confidence. Yes, we have been downgraded. It’s going to be a mammoth task.”Ramaphosa said they needed to stabilise state-owned entities and place good people on the boards.“Another important issue is to address the issue of state capture and corruption. In this regard we welcome the establishment of a commission of inquiry,” he said.“We want to see action taken against those who have done wrong and we have started seeing the beginning of that process. The prosecuting agency is beginning to move.”Ramaphosa said he was asking all South Africans to be committed to the process of addressing challenges facing the country so the world could take us seriously.“Government cannot do it alone, nor can the private sector. As I end, I believe we have a good message we are taking to Davos,” he said. “We are taking the message that we’re ready for investment... we have green shoots that are beginning to emerge.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsudgD9htAARMQX4hr4FM2bU3AUnCh88AcECFAr6QwplLAUlST05X7Pd6k82_oJExaGEHPFDfvExwQjbm4NekoA3VVTKPuoaye2ghAiJ-4P2ljHWDd8jhBeqHvmio04593YZNhaum-K7PO094M8C6ab0I4fEpWXIw9U00VAa1PV4-3VpCIHw0Sg91XQAaB6tK3zH-BVtx21XyxChmZj47fzMaWzUlnTK2m5duwxpnJPooJsfRW89y__Ec9_5TbDuruyLPZLyQkNWWMvRrr_djdz2SLqJRhA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLBSwYcLFHU9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
