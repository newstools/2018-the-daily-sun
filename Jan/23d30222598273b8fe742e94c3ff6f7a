"The raid resulted in two female victims, both aged 22, being freed and taken to a place of safety," he said. "The victims had allegedly been forced to work as sex workers after they were reportedly lured from Mpumalanga and [the] Free State respectively in 2017, with offers of employment."The case was postponed to January 15 when the man, who is in custody, is expected to apply for bail.The investigation continues, Ramovha added.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/human-trafficking-suspect-nabbed-in-cape-town-2-women-freed-20180108
