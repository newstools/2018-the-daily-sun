I’m done with my visa and other relevant documents to travel.”Ndlovu enjoyed a fine spell at Qarabarag, helping the team win the league earn their first ever spot in the Uefa Champions League group stages.He has been the toast of the Baku team, earning a cult status for his immense contribution.But the club could not offer him a new contract, going into the last six months of his current deal. Said Ndlovu: “I told them I’m happy at the club, but I’m not young anymore. “I cannot stay any longer if they didn’t offer me a contract, as I needed a new and improved deal.“But they didn’t put an offer on the table. I couldn’t delay and let the next opportunity slip away. I have to put my family and career first.”Ndlovu hasn’t played since early December, but could return to action as soon as next week.Meanwhile, Bafana Bafana teammates Bongani Zungu and Keagan Dolly will square off in the French Ligue 1 clash tomorrow.Zungu played for 72 minutes for Amiens as they went down 1-0 to Nice while Dolly also came on as a second substitution for Montpellier in their goalless draw with Monaco.But the interesting news is that the two might meet on the pitch after Dolly made his first appearance for Montpellier since September.Elsewhere, Kamohelo  Mokotjo featured for Brentford in their 2-0 victory over Bolton Wanderers in their English Championship match.
