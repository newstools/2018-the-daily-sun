A neighbour said: “ We always hear the two fighting but we would later see them laughing as if nothing had happened. So when we heard them fighting no one tried to stop them.”The baby daddy’s relative said: “We didn’t even know that our relative was in Durban. The last time I heard, he was in Cape Town. The two had a three-year-old girl and had been together for several years.”Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of murder was opened. The suspect will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court soon.
