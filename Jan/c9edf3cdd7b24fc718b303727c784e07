Two people were killed, and five others left injured in a crash in Pinetown, early on New Year’s morning, said paramedics. "Just after 04:00, Rescue Care Paramedics were called to the scene to find that a vehicle had somehow lost control and come to rest on its roof in a ditch on the roadside," said the service’s operations director Garrith Jamieson.  The accident occurred on the Dumisanya Makhanya Freeway just outside Claremont."Unfortunately, a male and a female, believed to be in their 30s, had suffered major injuries and there was nothing more anyone could do for them."if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstICB0pBcuwkXnxs55ErUZjfMOMAJR7opwJ4oEVYNvJptYIGyN_YJQUUSYeLWUcLyPpU4XU0tBwMIEVkl34SODyySqz_Hip-zNqhy9nPBtjpAsqrDN7Hm897Lyw62ClPYjvv4Hf4jZvP8WQVn1XdfuavzHl8-hDX0bl6wX9lDH5Oi7hhOD2l7z5LYZ-iTiHZKS7pd6MjZrz1QJzrv5sc1xbf5sLl47QRws5DJeBxIrpQPsmNcSWO9Mo_yleq1hs1S4S-fng93nLy4v-6H50ztN9Oa5XwpU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEJoWkQFb4YREAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
