According to Zwane, more than 5 000 drivers have been arrested, with 3 000 of them bust for driving under the influence of alcohol. Gauteng takes the lead followed by Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Western Cape. The other 2 000 were arrested for various traffic offences including speeding.Heavy traffic volumes have a tendency of attracting accidents, so for some Arrive Alive tips, this is what Zwane said:Planning is crucial and people should leave early. That way they won’t be impatient on the road. Since fatigue is one of the main contributing factors in most accidents, Zwane said: “Motorists should take regular breaks, avoid alcohol and also avoid speeding.”Motorists should ensure that their cars are roadworthy as unroadworthy vehicles will be impounded. The top five offences based on written traffic notices issued were: Speed, with 46 029 drivers fined.Driving without licences, with 15 538 drivers fined.Driving unlicensed vehicles, with 14 174 drivers fined.Driving without seat belts, with 13 554 drivers fined. Overloading of goods, with 5 388 drivers fined.More than 924 000 cars have been stopped and checked at various roadblocks throughout the country since the start of festive season.
