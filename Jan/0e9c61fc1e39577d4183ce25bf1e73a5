The eight suspects were arrested at a safe house in Sandringham, north of Joburg on Monday.The first group of suspects was arrested on Sunday night in Kwa-Thema, Ekurhuleni, after cops responded to a tip-off involving a safe bombing at the local petrol station.Dlamini said a substantial amount of money was stolen by 15 suspects but only three were arrested.He said: “A quick police response resulted in a shoot-out and one of the vehicles, a Nissan van, was abandoned at the scene. “One of three suspects arrested was shot and wounded. He’s under police guard at a local hospital. “Twelve other gang members escaped in three vehicles with false registrationnumbers,” said Dlamini. In a separate incident, eight other suspects were arrested at a safe house in Sandringham, north of Joburg on Monday.Dlamini said the house was raided by cops following the arrest of a suspect in Alberton, for a house robbery. He said: “On questioning him, he led police to where other gang members were hiding. After police arrested them, they were linked to the ATM bombing at Jeppe last year. The stolen vehicles found in their possession are suspected to have been used in serious and violent crimes including business robberies and ATM bombings.” The suspects are facing cases for contravention of the Explosive Act, attempted murder, business robbery, possession of suspected stolen vehicles and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition.   The arrested suspects are part of 321 suspects arrested for serious crimes at the weekend. These arrests include 24 for armed robbery, 21 for rape, 10 for murder, 126 for assault and others for attempted murder, common robbery and house breaking. Sixteen firearms were also seized.
