To the amusement of others, Senzi turns around in farm girl style and says: “He he! Ungidividiyelani manje?” It seems she doesn’t know the difference between a video and a DVD. However, this is far from the truth. Senzi is a happy and outspoken nurse who works and lives in the Durban CBD. She told Daily Sun she wanted to make her friends laugh.“I made the video last week when I was at home in Empangeni,” said Senzi. “I’m not embarrassed despite people assuming that I’m dumb. “As long as people are laughing I’m happy. “I never thought the video would make me so famous. “I now see even actors imitating me as they go on a DVD challenge.“I asked a friend to take the video and the words just came out. “I sent it to my friends on a WhatsApp group and from there it went viral. “Many people who saw the video said it took their January blues away.”
