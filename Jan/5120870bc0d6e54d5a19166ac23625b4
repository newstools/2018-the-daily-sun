That number rocketed from 28 000 to 32 000 as 4 500 late applications came in, said Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi.He promised that every child would be placed in a school. But parents won’t be able to choose because some schools are already full. “Parents who still have admission queries in relation to grade 1 and 8 are advised to visit admission centres,” said Lesufi. “The centres will continue operations until the end of January.”He said he believed all has been done to ensure a smooth start to the school year.It remains unclear if the troubled Klipspruit West Secondary School will be operational today as there are reports that parents are planning a protest.Lesufi said: “Given the underperformance at the school, the department is considering the option of re-establishing the school.Meanwhile, he said his life was in danger after two people posing as the media clashed with him.“They are asking the whereabouts of my children,” he said. “I am not scared. This revolution was never won by those who were scared. “I am quite convinced they know what they are doing and where I stand. I am more committed than ever before.”
