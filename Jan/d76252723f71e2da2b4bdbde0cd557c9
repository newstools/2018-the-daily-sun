sidelines of a special NEC meeting held on Wednesday, just days before
Ramaphosa delivered his first January 8 statement in celebration of the ANC's
106 years of existence. Magashule however, denied that
there was any debate around two centres of power, adding that the party had
resolved that the ANC was the only centre of power.Sources inside of the NEC had
earlier told News24 that Ramaphosa was scheduled to meet with Zuma during his
visit to KwaZulu-Natal at the weekend. Ramaphosa was said to be
negotiating Zuma's resignation as head of state.He was on a charm offensive in the
province on Sunday and Monday, meeting with the party’s rival groupings in the
province, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and paying homage to past ANC
presidents from the province.The visit was seen as an attempt
to soothe the wounds of the province’s embattled leadership after none of its
candidates made it to the party’s top six.The sources all agreed that it was
now a matter of when, and not if, Zuma stepped down. But the priority was not
"alienating his KZN support base".Some NEC members are pushing for
the newly elected leadership to recall Zuma and get the party on a "clean
slate" ahead of the all-important 2019 national elections.President Jacob Zuma however, has
shown no intentions of resigning.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ramaphosa-zuma-in-continuous-talks-as-speculation-of-a-recall-mounts-20180110
