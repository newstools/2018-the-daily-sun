I always wake up with a shock and I find muthi spread all over my yard.“I have suffered enough and I need help. This must stop.” She said she ignored the muthi but it stops her sleeping. “My legs are swollen and I am always sick. I want to get help – I don’t want to go through these horrors every day.”Ethel said the fight with her neighbour started in 2014. After her grandson found a job in Durban, her neighbour started acting strangely. “She threatened me and told me she would make me suffer. She died two years later and then the horror started. “I now hear noises like a football game but there’s nobody there when I check.”
