    BENJAMIN Tafari has not cut his hair for 18 years and doesn’t plan to do so any time soon!  The 37-year-old from Zwele-temba in Worcester, Western Cape, believes that, like Samson in the Bible, his power comes from his hair. “When you cut your hair, you are cutting your energy and your ability to get messages from the Almighty. Even Christ never went to the barber when he was on earth,” he said. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuSj-awVIwIsu2p2HTiJ4onm0FrzGmlStDaDWpoyYjWIHEUllU8pPVnQL9qpCQtdRARr-yYdMx0c15QYIFjHvHpnbZrKPJZwzMakOxrA14QeZ-u1MWchfJ8lw8UwNRBQzvfq498Q9dco7lm537MJH_hDIqW7MGqOwOaHaQ0XtdjEV3OGMPV3d9lBx0TlEAS4qCc_rOIT2ORWtrEI1oW9tm1i1_tsbCD8RQal5S6Tumvp2z4Nrv5RV3kiYZPiXMj-S750KtoyaHIg_1GJ2WIchM4wYhppOE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOn7ayLgwUsBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They would be angels delivering messages,” he said. According to Benjamin, colonisers introduced haircuts because they were scared of the power people would have if they left their hair long. He said a lot of disasters around the world could have been prevented if people hadn’t cut their hair. “People are not in their natural state and that is why we miss messages warning us of tragedies.” Benjamin said he used only natural products to wash his hair. “I use things like lemon, cactus and rosemary. “I don’t eat grapes or vinegar. “We are here to bring light to people in darkness but some think I’m trying to sound smart,” he said. Zuko Simelane (27) said although he cut his hair, he believed there was truth in what Benjamin said. “Most wise people I have met have long hair and beards.” Benjamin also teaches youths how to behave well.
