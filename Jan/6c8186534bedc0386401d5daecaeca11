But that’s football, there is nothing you can do when it comes to injuries.” In addition to the Usuthu encounter Ndou will miss City’s match against Ajax Cape Town at the same venue on 4 February.Following their draw with Matsatsantsa a Pitori, Molekwa said: “It was a tough game for us, especially after we lost Ndou in the early stage of the first half. “We lost shape after he got injured. But overall I am pleased with the attitude of my players, as they worked hard until the last minute of the game to get the goal. I will take the point with a smile on my face. It’s a good point against a strong side.”United opened the scoring through a header by veteran defender Morgan Gould after a free kick by captain Dean Furman, but City striker Puleng Tlolane broke United fans’ hearts in the last minute to share the spoils.
