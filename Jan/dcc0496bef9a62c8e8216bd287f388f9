Councillor Thulani Mthalane said gogo’s granddaughter told him that the suspect came to the house late on Sunday and attacked them. He said the granddaughter said the man raped and strangled gogo to death. The granddaughter managed to escape and alerted neighbours. Mthalane said the suspect was handed over to the cops by his family as they feared he would be killed by the angry residents.He said neighbours had rushed to the house and chased the suspect but gogo was already dead. “The residents are angry with the police because the same suspect had allegedly tried to rape the dead woman three months ago and they did nothing,” said Mthalane.He said cops allegedly told residents to look for the suspect themselves. One of the residents told Daily Sun that they wanted the police to release the suspect to them. “We are angry that they want to protect the suspect when they failed to protect gogo from this monster,” said another. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a 39-year-old man was arrested and will appear in the Howick Magistrates Court today.“Post mortem results will determine whether the woman was raped before being killed,” said Mbhele.He said the reason the suspect was not arrested following the alleged incident three months ago was that no one had opened a case against him. “But cops cannot tell people to look for the suspect themselves,” Mbhele added.
