Amos Maswanganyi (49) told Daily Sun the school has had bad luck. He said it had become the playground for thugs and that valuables were stolen shortly before the schools opened earlier this month.“When thugs feel like stealing they come to this school. The future of our children is being destroyed here.” Nomsa Masango (33), who lives very close to the school, said she heard people shouting on the street that the school was burning. “I saw people run towards the school early in the morning and I saw dark smoke coming out through the roof.” Jasper Zwane, spokesman for the department of education, said officials had been sent to the school to assess the damage. He said anyone with information should contact the police or the department. So far the cause of the fire remains unclear. KwaMhlanga police spokeswoman Sergeant Zimkhona Mahlangu said a case of arson was opened.
