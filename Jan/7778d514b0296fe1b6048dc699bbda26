PARENTS and teachers must work together to support pupils during their school years. This was the message from the acting principal of MH Joosub, in Lenasia, when he welcomed grade 8 pupils and their parents at the start of the new school year.“Parents must be involved in their children’s education. Gone are the days when parents were part of their children’s school life.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Success/Education&sz=300x250&c=414595758&t=artid%3d398b7104-b8ac-4553-bae3-793bd5c63ee3%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Success/Education&sz=300x250&c=414595758&t=artid%3d398b7104-b8ac-4553-bae3-793bd5c63ee3%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>He said the grade 8 pupils may have been big shots in primary school but now they were in high school.“Do not act like a bully because bullying is a no-no and we will discipline those who bully others.”Cindy Glass, co-founder and director of Step Up Education Centres, agreed that the parent-teacher relationship is important.“As parents, it is important to develop healthy relationships with our children’s teachers.” Studies show that children whose teachers and parents have a trusting relationship were likely to be a positive influence on the child or children.Tips for parent-teacher relationship Communication is key: Take a moment to meet your child’s teacher. Teachers use the meetings to explain their expectations of pupils to their parents. Remember, teachers will not know what your expectations are unless you tell them. Parent-teacher partnerships: You and your child’s teacher have a common goal: the personal and academic development of your child. Your child’s teacher is human: This means that mistakes are possible and that things will probably go wrong from time to time. Get involved with school activities: This is not always possible for many working parents but if there is an opportunity to be an active part in an activity at your kid’s school, you should take the chance and support them.
