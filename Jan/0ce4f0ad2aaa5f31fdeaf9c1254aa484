    AN AMERICAN woman fears for her life after a man came
into her house masturbating, and then offered her money to poke.Worse, the cops in the southern Thai town of Phuket where
she lives don’t seem to be taking her complaints seriously.According to The
Phuket News, the 56-year-old unnamed woman was at her home when a man
arrived on his motorbike. The woman told the newspaper what happened: “He came
to my house twice, once on 24 December and then on 30 December.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuGfazh7guEsxOQF8rx5YOOtIfuDP0nZ87BZ7K3hikzOAF0_aHRpjjDlZdRQIRHlp0Nv3G_uE8GYTAnjFS84uuBdCaxK5XCyNW7w4xDITNGn4_wVHiFJEsRXLiC2m2msNJRNURKsqMjbJxpBR8uI6T1uSC9KQKj0tT_16k12JmPFLlBY8OOWkvyXU3xUudMlVbs7yQejTJkzP7Gv2vLwLNtQek-gRjk3DQSM-UuHbOXNfpHE2rdWGiaBYefLr9Y6JDo6l9Kb8ZMSbGo7QyybixYLoc_0HlvgkMRCw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJIMlMLpTWfqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

‘Vichuda Hills’, which is a complex I suspect he worked at as a security guard.
I was there last year, so he had my number and was sending me messages last
September, which I have a log of.“He then asked to use my bathroom and was rubbing his
penis through his pants. He walked around the side of the house and offered B2 000
(about R760) to have sex with him.” Then on 30 December, she spotted a motorbike on her
property.  When she went to investigate,
she discovered it was the same man – this time masturbating on his motorbike!“I locked the door and grabbed my camera, then unlocked
the door and filmed a few seconds of him. I was so flustered, furious, mad and
scared, unfortunately I didn’t manage get the license plate number on camera,”
she is quoted as saying.She is now desperate for the man to stop before something
really terrible happens to her.But cops are “not treating it as a priority”, they say,
mainly because it happened over New Year when they’re busiest. However cop Maj
Jirapat said they are investigating.
