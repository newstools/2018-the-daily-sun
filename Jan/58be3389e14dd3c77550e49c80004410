Daily Sun tried to speak to Boitshepo’s parents but they were at the government mortuary and were too traumatised to speak.A relative at Boitshepo’s home claimed the boy had been complaining about the teacher.“Boitshepo said the teacher beat him with a hosepipe and it was very painful. He complained that the teacher enjoyed mocking him and other pupils, and encouraged the kids to tease him.”The relative said Boitshepo killed himself because he was tired of the treatment he received at school. Terrence’s mother, Nontsokolo Molwele (37), said: “My son told me he was going to kill himself but I didn’t take him seriously. He hanged himself with a skipping rope on the day school re-opened. We discovered his body in the backyard shack in the morning.“He failed grade 7 and was going to repeat it. He wanted to be a doctor.” Terrence will be laid to rest on Saturday at the graveyard in zone 2.Police spokesman Sergeant Martin Xuma confirmed both deaths and said inquests have been opened.Free State Education spokesman Howard Ndaba said: “We express our deepest condolences to the families. We are disturbed by these incidents. “Corporal punishment has been outlawed and action will be taken against anyone practising it.”Ndaba said the department will investigate.
