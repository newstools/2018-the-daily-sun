The video shows alcohol being passed around by the other kids.After seeing the video, the girl’s traumatised mum (43) laid a charge at the Sophiatown cop shop.But on the way to the cop shop she went to the home of the alleged bully and showed them the video.“I went to the girl’s parents and showed them the video. They didn’t care and told me: ‘Do what you want to do, we don’t care’.”“I am still angry and need justice for my daughter. “It was only after I interrogated her that she revealed it had happened at school as well. “That bully is going to kill my daughter next time and I have to put an end to it as a parent. “She was silent all this time when such horrible things were happening to her.“I can’t believe this. I am so angry I don’t know what to do.”Warrant Officer Jerbus de Bruyn of the Sophiatown cop shop confirmed that a case of assault was opened.“Police are investigating the matter because the suspect is a 12-year-old,” De Bruyn told Daily Sun. “She was returned to the custody of her family. Investigations are continuing.”
