A NEW Hampshire man was arrested for biting a cop dog
while officers were investigating reports of a shooting in the town of Boscawen
in America.The incident unfolded on Sunday when police reported to a
home where they were told a person had been shot. Two people at the home were
wanted on outstanding warrants and tried to flee when police tried to arrest
them, said Lieutenant Jason Killary of the Boscawen Police Department.“Both of them resisted arrest and one very strongly
resisted arrest. He bit the dog, the dog bit him. He ended up getting Tasered,”
Killary said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst5njxQ_FNxxz2bTb1pVFdKNc47kA7f5U0y4zKo6x0F681k3JkQW1hUeHjL-rSeNLUIgV8CJZycSk8r_jUG8WJxzGZgPl09hHzBSodb6CnI47McJSeVieSa6KnfxCe0GpMh_GLZL1rWhtlu1rzwRS0z-oHT7anfd53G0dcJ-e8OccY_aP46IpZKKzsUnpLdO4yB3kFt8Kf8hMyplJrM8abYydMWvUU9w_u0Rkcxj-LKolAsTJtfu90wQMYGu0p8hsojH5fbyzpCjudUp9b599DxLmLkkkXzzsk19w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGCfvEGwOHCFEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Association Facebook page as K9 Veda of the New Hampshire State Police, was
uninjured and cleared to return to duty.State police officials could not immediately provide
further details.Killary said he had never heard of an incident in which a
human attempted to bite a police dog.“If you get into a biting competition with a police dog,
you’re not going to win,” Killary said. “They’re pretty good at that.”
