We will also help the family with the burial in Eastern Cape.” Anathi’s gogo Reginah (60) said she was happy people cared for her family. “We realise as a family we are not alone. We thank all the people who helped us,” she said. Gogo Reginah said her son, Anathi’s father, was the breadwinner and was planning to marry the boy’s mum. “My son built our house in the Eastern Cape and looked after his kids, sisters and nephews,” she said. The family is still waiting for DNA results from the police before the funeral can be arranged in Queenstown. Anathi told the People’s Paper: “I remember what my father spoke about and I want to fulfil what we discussed.“I want to be a doctor one day and help people who are hurt.”
