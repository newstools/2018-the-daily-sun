THE City of Tshwane has condemned the torching of its offices in Mabopane yesterday by angry former employees of the expanded public works programme.The group of about 45 people whose contracts with the Vat Alles programme had expired arrived at the waste management depot in Block A, Mabopane at about 8am.“They broke down the security gate, burnt the stock of waste bins, an asbestos office and a kitchen,” said the city.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu27f75BBeCL_YDK9KksVkcoCC_5yquoVZR1IlJ7RSX2ivftuvSWoWIjD6zndH2LShni9W9rYJaHE50GVV-Cj2lmgGl94LL4yv_x3Z6NRm9mNuPp-x3_Zv50Hlx8Eu4ow_2ISV-8ijNi-ggSGC6zoUyQBs2EkIt0DxAXcxVM46TlCBA4ZbFQyH0bn00yaLMVO_GgggmutRKEMNSrQg5RMQhFIAuZdstuuta_karX49Bnxk2fEbY1C8RxVvQsZMbgaidEPfg6Q3JTp1PIrEAsLFbLlaCwDg\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YQPPxmyNwRBAA9YbBpVzXVbDx7w9wTWQcaFnMJSNpx7Wqt6g4PvP2AnFKh7pU3Cy-k42jLlUjpPBFIHmW-btzE7Qmd70o0Bys4G6wmKPQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAVoOMB2hsOpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The Rosslyn fire division was quickly dispatched to the depot to put out the fire.” Selby Bokaba, the city’s director for strategic communication, said the former Vat Alles employees were responsible for a series of service disruptions.He said they’ve caused chaos across the city since the beginning of this year after their contracts expired. “We call upon law enforcement to take action against those who have vandalised the city’s assets and intimidated our employees. No amount of intimidation and thuggery will deter us from continuing to deliver services to our people. A case docket has been registered with the local police.” The former workers said they had been working for the city for about three years.“From what we were told by the previous administration, we were on permanent contracts but now we’ve been fired without notice.” Nicholas Munyai, the ANC’s regional spokesman for Greater Tshwane, said: “These people were making a living with the little money they were earning, but torching buildings is not the way to solve problems.”
