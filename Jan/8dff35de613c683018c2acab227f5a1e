These young prospects are inspired by Mamelodi Sundowns defender Matjeka Madisha, who was the captain of the Brazilians MDC side two seasons ago.Madisha, who has shown a lot of maturity, has been a regular in the Sundowns first team and his outstanding performance saw the likes of Wayne Arendse and Thabo Nthethe falling out of coach Pitso Mosimane’s favour.Early this season Kaizer Chiefs Wiseman Meyiwa became the youngest ever player to score on debut (at age 17) when his side defeated Cape Town City 2-0 in Cape Town last September.While many were still in awe, Chiefs coach Steve Komphela unleashed another gem in Siyabonga Ngezana (20), who became the second teenager to score on his debut this season, helping his side collect maximum points against Downs.Darren Smith (21) of SuperSport United is another youngster who found the back of the net on his debut in the Premier Soccer League. Other players, who have tasted playing in the top flight from development, are Neo Maema, Kabelo Dlamini (Bloemfontein Celtic), Keletso Makgalwa (Sundowns), Siphosakhe Ntiya-Ntiya (Chiefs), Thabo Maphakisa (Free State Stars), Sibusiso Magaqa (AmaZulu) and a quartet of Ajax Cape Town Masilakhe “Scara” Phohlongo, Sergio Kammies, Grant Margeman and Yagan Sasman.On its fourth season, the MultiChoice Diski Challenge has made its intended impact in the PSL.
