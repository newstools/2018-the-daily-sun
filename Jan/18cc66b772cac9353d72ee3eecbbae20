We booked a limo again this year but it never pitched. However, the funeral was still very flashy.Mohale said they had the DJ play gospel songs, which were the gogo’s favourite.  “Gogo loved Sfiso Ncwane and we played his music. We’re happy to have given her a good send-off to show she was loved.”We continued to celebrate her birthday as we normally would. We had a decorated tent with 100 people inside. Surely, gogo is resting in peace knowing she was loved.”The family even had T-shirts printed with the gogo’s face, which they wore to her burial.
