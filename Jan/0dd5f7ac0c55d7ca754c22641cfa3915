Tabraiz Shamsi returns to the squad as a second spin bowling option.“This is a continuation of vision 2019 as we develop our squad for the 2019 ICC World Cup in England,” commented CSA National Selection Panel Convener Linda Zondi. “Lungi has achieved a remarkable double in being named Man of the Match on both his T20 and Test match debuts and he now gets the chance to show what he can do in the 50 overs format.“Khaya has been on the fringes of selection for some time now which included leading the South Africa A side on their recent 50 overs campaign against the England Lions. He forms part of our vision to give opportunities to fringe players and we will continue this policy throughout the build-up to the World Cup.“It is good to have both Morne and Chris back in the squad as the 2019 World Cup is little more than a year away now,” concluded Zondi.PROTEAS ODI SQUAD: Faf du Plessis (Multiply Titans, capt), Hashim Amla (World Sports Betting Cape Cobras), Quinton de Kock (Multiply Titans), AB de Villiers (Multiply Titans), JP Duminy (World Sports Betting Cape Cobras), Imran Tahir (Hollywoodbets Dolphins), Aiden Markram (Multiply Titans), David Miller (VKB Knights), Morne Morkel (Multiply Titans), Chris Morris (Multiply Titans), Lungisani Ngidi (Multiply Titans), Andile Phehlukwayo (Hollywoodbets Dolphins), Kagiso Rabada (bizhub Highveld Lions), Tabraiz Shamsi (Multiply Titans), Khayelihle Zondo (Hollywoodbets Dolphins) FIXTURESFebruary 1:         D/N @ 13h30     1st Momentum ODI, Sahara Stadium Kingsmead, DurbanFebruary 4:         Day @ 10h00      2nd Momentum ODI, SuperSport Park, CenturionFebruary 7:         D/N @ 13h30     3rd Momentum ODI, PPC Newlands, Cape TownFebruary 10:       D/N @ 13h30     4th Momentum ODI, Bidvest Wanderers, JohannesburgFebruary 13:       D/N @ 13h30     5th Momentum ODI, St George’s Park, Port ElizabethFebruary 16:       D/N @ 13h30     6th Momentum ODI, SuperSport Park, Centurion
