WHEN the kids saw the old car dumped outside the shacks, they couldn’t help themselves and had to have a look.But being curious almost cost Zama Moji (9) her life last Thursday, when she was trapped in the car. When she tried to open the door, her hand was cut and she had to be taken to hospital.Now residents of Zandspruit, Joburg want the owner to take the car to the scrapyard or they say they’ll dump it in her bedroom.They said the owner parked the car in her yard for years but now that she was extending her house, she’d put it in the street.“We told her to take her car to the scrapyard but she said she wants someone to pay her R4 000 for the scrap and until then, her car will stay where it is,” said a resident.“Now look what’s happening.“Our children get injured because of her.”Zama’s mum Molebogeng Moji (32) said: “I was hoping the owner would help me with medical costs but she didn’t offer.”Busi Thubane confirmed removing the car from her yard because she’s extending her house but she told Daily Sun she often warned kids not to play in the car.“There’s nothing I can do if they don’t listen. I can’t go around guarding children. I’m waiting for scrap dealers to take the car.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssGG4Zy8sNUEsUqFoDY8X_gG3i2C3GkMO5BQgh7IcQnSmxazXpbaCGZzC4xyqkfbS0z3vH-j_Di6lgwLYS_4Q3QRlBQBcKQ0RgdFBM9AL5mMMQH0M4jz0R57iMK4ftzOCr5AaYSQPYlEYUXbN7hs011eFE2U-jG29Wlh-mX-BSleAJTgMClqM9x3yroYG_m2fDTXAKu-i3M00SaiwtB0zlt3UZjH7DjlNLpRlgIwaXbnjE_cRcbWJTP89vHy2P6eVVYwSZLln8vGvjb23-4QXjuQyywUnQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOg1AovE2sWiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
