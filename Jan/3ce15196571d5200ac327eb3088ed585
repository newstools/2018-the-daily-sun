    Men, as breadwinners, should use their money wisely and stop wasting it on booze. If they don’t change their behaviour, they’ll fall into the debt trap for a long time. I was worried when I saw men standing in long queues, waiting to buy booze on New Year’s Eve. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvUYnsfjsi0KbMh9OV4eoZD1jYKq6ftm7EMewWHyd4yTszrh9oHH4BKhvBsmIBPlR1QE7Pywx0OuXKRQ4_r43DBrXnxVksliNQRQiy65h5PE7bOLgN-5k9GnRmLHUZmWCTOPtZQflfACKNO8iLEwsw6QBph7chP600yyZP23XuIJgD0t6jfe8hDcZ3Z61SuXE6kgOQPJawDroo8BRkhQu0GcwQ2ok3TQEn40FGVxATJPnk9Kh1B7sof549Q9dmnsG1Cbi3ZJljTiuSxZcwzw_gCqquSVHw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM_ZXfgRTKaSEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Most men are careless and forget there’s still tomorrow. Some even forget to put money aside for kids’ registration fees. We need to take responsibility as men and show that we are the heads of our families. Let’s stop prioritising alcohol. We should change our attitudes and think about the future of our kids. It’s okay to drink alcohol. But don’t abuse it. It was sad to see people competing over who drank the most. Good men put their kids first, not alcohol. We lack planning and don’t use our money wisely. January is a month many dread. It’s important to plan properly to survive the festive blues. Norman MaakeTembisa
