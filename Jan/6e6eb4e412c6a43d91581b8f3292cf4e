SQUATTERS from Overcome Heights in Muizenberg didn’t enjoy the festive season because of the sewer that burst and spilled human waste in their homes.Monica Mashaba (34), who lives with six siblings, said they are afraid that they would wake up surrounded by kak because the pipe is right in front of their shack.“I sweep human waste away from my door every day and it’s not nice. We can’t use the room nearest to the pipe. We are afraid we are going to die because of this,” she said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsskF_ybmmd9L3fwXXZ4t8KJBoEyzQT6DA9Ge3frTCRFY67XpHtJX2ObYAxEEWIYGh-_3BkVVXQ8hOA2p5AbbzsEbpe78xqr0QLw6WBLpglH1biyvkeUqG5HWMtpFdaDoAVYWzm96tZTnYcwL8BjiYnw50HhDmtwLqmcEkvIxtBDa1vB4c-4ri_ltGQwB-uUw9wZRgbToIr8SqdugQ-SpbBGYR9byU6OP__oWeyb5J278j1UtmdyAKSVNoQcm1vEjkK0xB4cgsUokOToYg-PAWLAj7R040Y\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNrObp_n42CFEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We can’t even smell cooked meat because the stench coming from the kak is too strong,” said Monica.Remember Mkhonto (43), who lives near the burst pipe, said they have reported the matter to the City of Cape Town.“Some people just came and took pictures last year but left without saying anything.“I wonder what the officials will do if we sink and die inside these shacks because of this pipe.“The People’s Paper is our only and last hope to get help. If you fail, we will never get help,” he said.Councillor Xanthea Limberg, the mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water, waste services and energy, said she has asked for a report on the matter and will take action to have the pipe fixed as soon as possible.
