have been pelted with stones during a strike by minibus taxi drivers in the
Pietermaritzburg CBD on Thursday.Pictures of roads barricaded with burning rubble, concrete
rubbish bins and a burning car have been circulated on social media.South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) Umgungundlovu
region chairperson Bheki Sokhela told News24 that the strike was organised by
minibus taxi drivers who are not happy with the "expensive" fines
they get from the Umsunduzi municipality's traffic officers when letting
passengers off in the CBD.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstkDAesA7AtfP_rKLOhrLwyNXbeF6crMH6ED71qFLE6mBmYpPmozg3s-RM332RGT0XtTfj3yXA123I358-eXOPr5Es80bHAkLfNgPF5J64cnunvN4dvOWlxtQ37wqq4pssFCzQX53UE9xo-7qElftBszqAETcZPGKu6QPshmQ4M3TeSqPeHrYZytDiQ18eIHoC-ao9WxhE8Fq_Bxri2agKTu56HVqfnr6hHn7YYbtad5dH84ADMO1TFjOt2Dt8YBB_Vf1Msoz_7hd-X7GyGxXFsNbo6bH4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDNogSFDNLdVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

were already on strike. When they spoke to us as taxi operators in the region,
they told us that the Umsunduzi municipality's traffic officers were charging
them a loaf and a half when fining them for minor offences such as offloading
in the CBD," he said.Traffic finesHe said some of the drivers showed them traffic fines that
were as high as R7 000.In the CBD, there are no designated passenger offloading
zones for taxis, he said."They asked where are they supposed to offload when
there are no offloading zones. The drivers are not against the traffic fines,
but they are asking for reasonable fines that they can afford to pay," he
said.The drivers also demanded that traffic officers not conduct
road blocks between 05:00 and 08:00 in the morning.Chaos in Pietermaritzburg during taxi strike. (Supplied:
Niksha Deeplaul) Drunk driversSokhela said Santaco had met with the municipality's
officials and had given them a memorandum of the drivers' grievances."They'll get back to us within seven days," he
said.He denied any knowledge of cars being pelted with stones and
set alight."I haven't heard about that. I was in the meeting with
municipal officials at the city hall. I can't confirm if it happened or not.
What I know is that police attempted to arrest some of them," he said.He said he was doubtful that taxis would resume operating on
Thursday afternoon."Most of the drivers were drunk during the strike and I
don't think they are in a good state to drive. I can't put people's lives at
risk by allowing them to drive passengers home because they might cause
accidents now," said Sokhela, adding that he "thinks" the
minibus taxis would only start operating on Friday.Municipal spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha told News24 via
WhatsApp that the municipality condemned "the illegal strike in the
strongest possible terms"."We have received the memorandum from the taxi
operators and we will be responding to it through the organised taxi body."We would like to extend our sincere apologies to the
residents, visitors and businesses that were affected by such. We are working
with the police, municipality security to ensure the situation is contained. We
condemn vandalizing of property and the law will take its cause where
necessary," she said.Chaos in Pietermaritzburg during taxi strike. (Supplied:
