promised to do,” he is quoted as saying.“We are ready to assist the ANC to do the right things.”Speaking to Daily Sun, Political Analyst Ralph Mathekga
believes that Mbeki should “give Ramaphosa space to figure things out.”“I don’t know the status of the relationship between
them, but we know that they didn’t get along when Mbeki took over as ANC
President, because that was when Cyril departed to do business,” he said. “Perhaps Mbeki
wants to get an opportunity to build a better ANC. He understands what is going
on in the party as he was president.“Some of the factionalism could be traced to end of his
leadership.“He has had his own term. As important as it is that he
wants to help, he must give them space because things have changed,” he said.Mathekga believes that Mbeki should not be making a hasty
comeback to politics.“No doubt they could use his advice, but I don’t think he
should be taking such an active role.“Conditions are different from when he was ANC president.“Ramaphosa must find a way to maneuver within the party
structures,” he said.
