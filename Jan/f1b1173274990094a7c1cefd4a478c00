These boys must watch out. They are also going to be killed,” he said. Thomas Chauke, from the South African Wildlife Trade, was shocked to hear about the boys swimming in the dam.“We advise parents in the area to monitor their kids. If they swim in the dam they could end up being killed by crocodiles,” he told Daily Sun. “I can tell you the dam is very dangerous. There are also many hungry hippos living in the water.” But Vongani, Victor and Thomas from Nthlaveni don’t take warnings seriously.They said they had heard crocodiles had attacked people in the area but they believed they were safe.“We look out for crocodiles and if we see them, we throw rocks at them. They move away and then we can go and swim,” said Thomas, dripping water and smiling brightly. He said they started swimming in the dam in September. “We don’t have swimming-pools in our villages. We will continue coming here after school and on weekends, whether there are crocodiles or not,” he said.Freddy said he has also seen other boys in the dam.“A month ago I had to save two boys from drowning. I was net fishing when I heard them scream. I ran there and jumped into the water to pull them out. Although I was happy to rescue them, I was unhappy that the parents of the boys didn’t even bother to compensate me.”
