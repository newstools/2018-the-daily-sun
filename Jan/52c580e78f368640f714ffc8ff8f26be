I was told that I was late and that the house had been given to another person.”He said he visited the municipality several times to see if they could resolve the matter, but had no success.“No one was prepared to help me. I finally gave up because the whole process was stressful. I am really angry.”His wife, Miriam Vena (58), said: “It’s bad that after being on the housing waiting list for so many years, we were told that the house was given to someone else. We can’t afford to pay rent. No one in the family is working.”Councillor Rooi Nodonti said Enock should come to his office so his case can be resolved. “I don’t know about this case. But Enock should come with all his documents, as well as proof of the house he claims was given to another person.”
