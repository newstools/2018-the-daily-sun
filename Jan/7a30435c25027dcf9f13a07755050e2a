TROUBLED Platinum Stars have promised tight security for their Absa Premiership clash with Orlando Pirates at Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). This is in light of some of their diehard fans threatening to disrupt this match due to the looming sale of the Rustenburg based side. In preparation of this showdown with the Soweto giants and the expectation that thousands of fans will attend this game, there will be increased security at the stadium.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstxPrn1R_1O9l1qc2twFDJ8iFrMt0ABNUCNpCNrd5_M9CwGmU4xVIQBoI0pPnZTW_OUwfzMHT7Qv8Djgd2KZKCdi0qAbDOvQetZJLikheqP9REwXbc3oFTCCIuoY3MNr20ASAjsjALZdasX05uWVeGgyIYeN8rpocMK0-LgYyzQW2vQSMr0gUF54iSHruNDFYYjelopk2UheLclI-yUOT3tvwIqTLEKhavuTltR9OECdZl2w-rJKG--loogL_f29sJYAujetflVZYf-YRu-Onl70A\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIv0y3ft-7YIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We have taken major steps to ensure the safety of football fans who do come to the game. We have our safety officers and the police who will enforce those safety measures.” Dikwena urged their players to ignore the ructions and concentrate on the game. “We are aware that the players will have seen these stories in social media and also on radio.“But they know they need to focus on the game and let the management deal with this off-the-field issues. This is an important game for us and we want all our players to be fully focused.” Commenting on the game, Mochadibane said De Sa had a nice headache, as all their players were available for this clash.“This is big match,” he said.“The coach does not have to do much motivating among the players, as they are already motivated by this clash. “It is a must-win game for us, we want to move away from the relegation zone. “The mood in camp is amazing, the boys can’t wait for tomorrow.” On-form Pirates come into this clash on the back of a 1-1 draw with Polokwane City FC, while Dikwena suffered a 3-0 defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns most recently.Pirates head coach Milutin Sredojevic will banking on Ntsikelelo Nyauza, Mpho Makola and Amigo Memela to bag maximum points, while Stars will be relying on experienced players such as captain Vuyo Mere and Robert Ngambi.Sixth-placed Pirates, who are currently seven points behind leaders Sundowns, are desperate for a win to boost their chances of fighting for the Premiership title this season. A win for Stars could move them away from the bottom, but only if Bidvest Wits and Ajax Cape Town lose this weekend.
