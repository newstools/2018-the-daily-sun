    FREE State Stars have been warned to keep their feet firmly on the ground and focus on their first goal of reaching 30 points.The high-flying Stars are currently third in the Absa Premiership table with 25 points from 16 games after winning three league games in a row. They’ve beaten Orlando Pirates, Bidvest Wits and SuperSport United in succession. Ea Lla Koto, who face second placed Cape Town City FC at Goble Park on Saturday, are six points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, having played the same number of matches.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss_9BHZrbO-blV6lP7PM0YcKpt4zTSY-qeumnjK4AUjjU6y8FZ4t_HHUzLtFugaEQyHTI1BVQcqeLr4OEEs479VdJKNuN8dIh5lGLsnNPKlSF4E0giTiDoz6j7iuiUNpGo0fPRTyfjJq_Ccbjg8rnB-bbM_d2txEuxeuFgBbrCAtBwec2zmvc-9tux4T-GbF2q8uudOp88LcgMzYm2i0lnZ9QodB5qlZQdtSISEjp58sS9qwy9IzVIuLMnFYkvRb1rCA-rfwbkEMprvSTr2UFe8uA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHZcg2bpAaWfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We are aware that people might start saying we should challenge for the title, considering the position we are in. “If we get to 30 points, we will know for sure that we are safe from relegation. We want to reach our first goal and then we can talk about finishing in the top eight. But for now our goal has not changed.”He added: “We want to keep working hard and get better throughout the second round.”But no one will blame Ea Lla Koto fans for thinking they could very well mount a challenge for the title under their new Belgian coach Luc Eymael, who has been impressive this season. Under the 58-year-old Eymael, the much improved Stars have won seven games, drawn four and lost five so far. Only Sundowns with 10 wins and City with eight victories have won more games than they have this season.Mokoena also revealed that they will be adding two or three new players before the January transfer window closes.
