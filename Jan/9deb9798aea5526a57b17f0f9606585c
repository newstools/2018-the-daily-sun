There is a time for everything and I know for sure he lived his life.”Author and journalist Bongani Madondo, who was close to Bra Hugh, said: “I referred to him as Hughskie, which is what the late soul icon Marvin Gaye called him, and he referred to me as Die Dondiez. Hughskie will live forever.“He was of his era but also saw the future. Thus he was a futurist. Personally, I’m at a total loss. He was more than a mentor or an uncle I never had. He was a friend. Age and pain disappeared when we were together.”Bra Hugh’s son Sal wrote on Instagram yesterday: “It is difficult to comprehend that this moment is real. To me my father has always been ageless and immortal.”Award-winning superstar Angelique Kidjo posted a picture of her and Bra Hugh on Twitter with the caption: “Today I lost a friend. He was a pioneer.“He was one of the first musicians to spread African music all over the world. But most of all, he was a funny, generous and beautiful soul.”He was a pioneer.
