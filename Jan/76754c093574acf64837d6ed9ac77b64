This is appalling,” Oscar’s wife can be heard saying in the video.In his Facebook post, Oscar said they confronted the waiter who said it meant nothing.“After not falling for the waiter’s poor excuse, we then asked to see the manager, who came up with a different excuse. “He claimed all the tables were colour coded.” He said the people seated next to them helped prove their allegations about racial profiling.Oscar wrote on his Facebook page: “All thanks to the guys seated next to us who showed us their bill. It proved that the manager’s story about colour coding does not exist. Their bill was labelled whites.” He said his family was angry because when they requested answers from the manager, he just walked away.Oscar said after a few minutes the manager came back and told them they didn’t have to pay for their meal.“It seems as if they are used to black people not paying their bill, so they labelled the bill in case we didn’t pay. “We are capable of paying our own bill,” Oscar’s wife said.When Daily Sun contacted the restaurant, the hotel’s reservation manager, George Mathebula said they were investigating the matter.He said they never had such incidents in their restaurant and their billing system had no race labelling code.
