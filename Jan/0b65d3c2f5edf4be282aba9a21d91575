public protector Thuli Madonsela has advised her successor, Busisiwe Mkhwebane,
that an extension of the Zondo Commission's brief will amount to "scope
creep"."Anything
else (than alleged state capture committed by President Jacob Zuma, his family
and the Guptas) would not only be in defiance of the court order, but derail
and delay the investigation," Madonsela told News24 in response to
Mkhwebane's statement released on Wednesday.Mkhwebane,
a former State Security Agency (SSA) employee, offered Zuma her assistance in
developing the terms of reference for Deputy Chief Justice Ray Zondo's inquiry
into state capture, adding that it should not be limited to the issues
investigated or identified by Madonsela's probe.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstmfSg4wioSSUfeQ1oCX7JJv5QmINOXOQIVEYQuH73ia0yEDcR3xA4BUfxlD2wH1JME33qDmq0J6ic4pJoKdb1_QTixWuBa_v2HT06OPbo79OIMUCSc-bGRYb0_SRDK9xiAlq6vpHXFqC0WrJCN0R0i6nLTEKpa6fk3PxbMAkZseQr12PWBfqncGG8eNs-9ME7PLFZbVIls_XzaspcvILecjr6zbxatsVDhk-WAj6B-pLDDBDptuulgnP-6iNGhKs-4PRAC1SxcjH3x20rN1-9It3AbfS0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFskBXieUAwyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

investigation was triggered by numerous complaints about reports that the Zumas
and the Guptas have conspired to capture state-owned enterprises for their
personal benefit.Zuma
unsuccessfully challenged Madonsela's report in the North Gauteng High Court in
Pretoria last month. The court agreed with Madonsela that a judicial commission
of inquiry should continue the probe she had started into the Zumas and the
Guptas.'Expand the
issues'But
Mkhwebane, like many of Zuma's supporters, has argued for a much wider
investigation."In
order to ensure that no stone is left unturned in so far as the allegations of
state capture are concerned, and in order to avoid any further allegations of
state capture being lodged with the Office of the Public Protector, the Public
Protector calls upon the president of RSA to ensure that the terms of reference
for the Commission of Inquiry are not limited to the issues investigated or
identified in the State of Capture report," Mkhwebane said in her
statement.It is a
matter of public record that Black First Land First leader Andile Mngxitama has
complained to Mkhwebane about "white corruption, including white state
capture".Mkhwebane
has called on Zuma to ensure that Zondo has the power to "expand the
issues to be investigated, should any relevant evidence of state capture be
brought to him during the inquiry", an approach Madonsela differs from
vehemently."Any
state capture allegation not identified in the report (State of Capture) cannot
be part of the investigation, unless they are incidental to the main
allegations. Should the commission come across state capture allegations that
are not incidental to the main allegations or matters identified for
investigation in the report, those will be scope creep," Madonsela said.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/madonsela-hits-back-at-mkhwebane-over-scope-creep-20180111
