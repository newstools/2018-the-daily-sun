December 2014. The drugs were hidden in a secret compartment in the backpack
she was carrying.The court accepted her explanation that she had been
tricked by someone she had met online called “Captain Daniel Smith”, who
claimed to be an American serviceman. After a long online romance with Captain
Smith, they arranged to meet up in Shanghai in eastern China. They failed to
meet up, and instead Exposto met a stranger who asked her to take a backpack to
Melbourne in Australia. She agreed.When Exposto arrived in the Malaysian capital to catch
her connecting flight to Australia, she got confused and went through customs
by mistake. This is when the drugs were discovered in the backpack she carried.Judge Ghazali Cha said at her trial: “I agree with the
defence lawyer that the accused did not have knowledge about the drugs.“I believe that at that time her feelings of love towards
‘Captain Daniel Smith’ overcame everything, including her own husband, her
family and her future.”Speaking as she left the courtroom, Exposto said: “I’m
happy now that I’m free.”There are at least 900 people on death row in Malaysia,
according to the report, but few have been executed in recent years.
