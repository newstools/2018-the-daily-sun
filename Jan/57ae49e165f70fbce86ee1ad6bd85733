TOO much wine, champers and beer could have some bad
health effects.If you celebrated hard during the festive season, you may
have experienced Holiday Heart Syndrome: palpitations and irregular heartbeat,
or arrhythmia.Nicole Jennings, spokeswoman for Pharma Dynamics – a
leading supplier of heart medication – said holiday heart is a condition that
typically occurs during the holidays. It’s when people who don’t suffer from
heart disease, experience irregular heart rhythms after heavy boozing.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>“Holiday heart is typically associated with the
consumption of an excessive amount of alcohol in a short period of time. It can
cause arrhythmia and other heartbeat irregularities, shortness of breath and
chest pain. “The effects are reversible if you greatly reduce your
drinking, but can be alarming when you first experience it.”The link between boozing and the onset of cardiac
arrhythmia has been well documented. It was first reported in the 1970s when Dr
Philip Ettinger noticed an increase in cardiac rhythm disturbances in patients
following heavy holiday drinking.Most of the arrhythmia associated with holiday heart are
atrial in nature. Atrial fibrillation – heart palpitations, fatigue and
shortness of breath – is the most common, but atrial flutter – a fast heart
rate of more than 100 beats a minute – and ventricular ectopy – when your heart
skips a beat – are also common. Jennings said the mechanisms of holiday heart aren’t
fully understood but it is known that alcohol affects the conduction paths of
the heart, which explains the onset of atrial fibrillation. “When the heart develops a rhythm like atrial
fibrillation, the atria stops contracting in unison, which decreases the amount
of blood moving through the heart. This causes a drop in blood pressure that can
result in dizziness and in response, the body increases its heart rate. “Stopping all alcohol for a while is usually the
recommended treatment, but it’s best to see a doctor who will check for a
dangerous drop in blood pressure or signs of acute heart failure. “Slow down your alcohol intake, especially if you have
congenital heart disease or have an increased risk of heart disease as a result
of obesity, smoking, high cholesterol or hypertension. Don’t overeat and reduce
your salt intake. Too much salt causes water retention which increases blood
pressure, and that puts you at greater risk.
