AN overflowing pit toilet has caused a rift between two neighbours. Rebecca Seeletse (69), from block T of Soshanguve in Tshwane, told Daily Sun her neighbour’s toilet has been leaking sewage for the past three months. Now she and her neighbour, Charles Moodie, are no longer on speaking terms.“He doesn’t want to remove his waste from my yard. My house used to be beautiful but now it’s filled with sewage,” she said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The angry gogo said when Charles’ pit toilet started leaking, she built a wall hoping it would help keep the waste out of her yard. “The sewage ruined my wall. Now it’s starting to eat away at my house,” she said.Rebecca said after she realised there was no reasoning with her neighbour, she went to seek help from Councillor Phumzile Hlatshwayo. But even the councillor’s intervention made no difference.Hlatshwayo said he asked elders in the community to talk to Charles, but the gogos and madalas claim he disrespected them.“I feel sorry for the gogo but there’s nothing we can do if the man is not bothered by all that sewage in the yard,” said Hlatshwayo.He said he asked Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga to set aside money for the construction of flush toilets in the area.“The process might take time. I hope the residents can bear with us and try to be considerate to their neighbours.” When the People’s Paper called Charles, he refused to talk to the SunTeam and hung up the phone.
