Right there he knew he’d found one of the thugs that had broken into his school a week before schools opened for the first term.He went to his car, pretending to be getting money, but he was actually calling cops!The thug was arrested for theft of school property and the goods were taken to Etwatwa cop shop.Police spokesman Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said several primary and high schools were broken into just before schools opened.“The thugs stole school shoes and stationery. We bust two suspects last week and are happy that we’re continuing to make more arrests.“We appeal to community members to keep their eyes open and report anyone selling stolen goods. We want to bring it to an end.”Maqabe said they were waiting for representatives from the school to come and identify their property.The suspect will appear in court soon.Anyone who has information that could lead to more arrests should contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
