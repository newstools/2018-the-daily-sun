BIDVEST Wits boss Jose Ferreira has squashed rumours that their key defender and captain Thulani “Tyson” Hlatshwayo will join Orlando Pirates.SunSport has reliably learnt that Hlatshwayo will don the black and white jersey in a swap deal that will see versatile Abbubaker Mobara and midfielder Riyaad Norodien joining The Students.Norodien has seen little action since he joined Pirates from Ajax Cape Town in July 2016. Wits and Bucs have always traded players with the likes of Daine Klate, Sifiso Myeni and Lehlohonolo Masalesa among players who moved between the clubs.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv9_MNJxI150b5WQ1QWfzhMrTVBfLyvq89dv71zt6sDzqFGRojNq_i7rSOapu_f0gGd2NbPaSdsLljzPICw7pJToCCC4AKJGZ5pVgk1oFIGpkBTzV5Ledegs6GHOu1dRQ90XXsb8lf4yWyvCPKJ080okNGgXMkwYymp916LcmANFcYGjyuOevlVQwzWkNIqiP1LKRQir3fWtQmZdNzwyBIdNgjI-Idl6TMk8TlSNmemBlNAWzWXawiH4J3NGXBBGVfZq4AVeWbKwes7BhD9EAFZwA\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YSXHBmVppGwviIM6rPiHZv2CI6CmD90d0rjNMbyLpp_Y2blif5CEE8zl595qqVrpdOw32oYhk-I8Pt6thSYwqV2SmvjrtAbuDSKS6uh\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzK6GQ7rjaKw1EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Pirates have never approached us and we have never discussed Tyson with them. It’s clear that someone is sending out the wrong information to the public.”Ferreira revealed that their door is still open to beef up their squad before the transfer window closes on 31 January. Wits have recently signed Keegan Ritchie, Edwin Gyimah, Denis Weidlich and Lehlohonolo Majoro.Explained Ferreira: “You will never know what could happen between now and the 31st, we might sign or release players. If there is quality player out there and we reckon he will add value to the club then we will sign him.”  Ferreira is positive the club will move away from the relegation zone.Wits are second bottom, tied with basement club Platinum Stars and AmaZulu on 15 points from 17 matches. But Usuthu have a better goal difference.  Wits have also been inconsistent in the new year as they lost 1-0 to Free State Stars, beat SuperSport 2-0 and drew 1-1 with Chippa United.“I am happy with the team’s performance so far.”
