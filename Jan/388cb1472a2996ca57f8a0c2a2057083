However, Oliphant came to the defence of the SABC and her department. She said the department buys space in different magazines and print media and they choose where and when to place them. “Our responsibility is to provide content and sometimes artwork and interviewees. The minister is the face of the department and its agencies,” said Oliphant. SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago told Daily Sun: “The matter is with the board. Once they are done with the investigations, we will communicate our findings.”
