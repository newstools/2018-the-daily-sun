    THE KZN provincial leadership of the ANC was not dissolved and is still in charge.This was revealed by the party’s secretary-general, Ace Magashule, yesterday. The ANC’s new top six, except for Jessie Duarte, visited King Goodwill Zwelithini at his Osuthu Palace in Nongoma, northern KZN. Magashule pointed out that they were not there to discuss the KZN leadership because the provincial executive committee was not dissolved, as many people were made to believe. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsugRppGMH2rwLhfEkUo8W6iKKk0GeQkHNtb4aLh3bqcusLtWAxUmWuz-e6hX4v_EvWoVLIqkYMAeifY-WQC-ox7Gz6q4IFllBetdqghXTZxnimjIooFSNBvyWy2GMJePj9G80y1FDxRCPIJX80ZwbD3It2W1UrFnnFUJRyt0p2hxaDLfTywcz5Gaco-n9iRuDfAZ3zDIRkITalr3NwlkSOyoGhwjcLL6YEq5iL3ck-T5OkmeQ97NWuluOs8yslArG7yswwi9XrmrxUX8hZokW3kbBgJ8T8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHdmv8sV1I66EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

His explanation dismissed rumours that the party’s top six would appoint a provincial task team as part of its visit. A day before the 54th ANC conference in Joburg, the Pietermaritzburg High Court ruled that the provincial leadership could appeal the decision but remained dissolved pending the outcome of their appeal to another court.Ramaphosa said his leadership felt it should visit traditional leaderships throughout the country to report the decisions taken at the conference. He thanked the Zulu king for his unifying role in the country. NEC members Senzo Mchunu, Bheki Cele, Bathabile Dlamini and Malusi Gigaba accompanied the visitors.Today Ramaphosa will lay wreaths at the graves of former ANC presidents Langalibalele Dube and Josiah Gumede.
