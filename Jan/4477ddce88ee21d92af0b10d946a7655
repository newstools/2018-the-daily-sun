They forced her to open her door and, when she opened it, they took her in front of her helpless son," she said.Mabaso said Mthuli's other two children were with her on the night of the incident.Mabaso said it was close to midnight when the men allegedly attacked Mthuli's house."We want both the men to rot in jail. They must pay for what they did. Nomusa's children are now orphans because of the two men," she said.Mabaso said Mthuli's mother and herself would now have to take care of their grandchildren."We now have to share responsibility and try to raise them," she said.Mthuli's mother, Phumephi Mthuli, 69, said she was still too angry to speak about what happened to her daughter.DA KwaZulu-Natal leader Zwakele Mncwango said Mthuli's brutal murder had shocked the party."We're here in court to say we've had enough when it comes to violence against women and children. We're worried about the young boy who was with Nomusa on the day of the incident. We've taken a decision as the DA to arrange counselling for him," said Mncwango.He said the party was calling for the court to deny bail for the two accused.Some DA members protested outside court during court proceedings.The court adjourned the matter to January 16, for bail applications.The State asked for the adjournment so it could verify the addresses of the two accused.Both of them were kept in custody at the Westville prison after Mkhize told the court he was allegedly "badly assaulted" by police at the Tongaat police station where the two had been previously kept.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/alleged-killers-must-rot-in-jail-family-of-da-activist-murdered-on-christmas-day-20180109
