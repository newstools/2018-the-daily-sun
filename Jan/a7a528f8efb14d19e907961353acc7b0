retailer Steinhoff amid an accounting scandal in early December, is a noted
horse racing owner and enthusiast. The PSA had previously called for a boycott of the event, one of
the most important dates on the SA horse racing calendar.PSA spokesperson Tahir Maepa told Fin24 on Wednesday afternoon
that while a protest was still set to take place at the race, it would be a
broad “solidarity protest” against Jooste, and not against the NHRA or the race
itself. “Our fight is not against the Sun Met or the National Horseracing
Authority, but against Jooste,” he said.Further details would be announced on Thursday.The race is set to take place on Saturday in Cape Town at the
Kenilworth Racecourse. Investigations The PSA said it would also on Thursday release the preliminary
findings of its investigation into Steinhoff. This after Steinhoff, which is headquartered in Stellenbosch, last
week allowed Fedusa and the PSA to access financial documents dating as far
back as 2002.“The PSA obtained financial and administrative information in
support of planned civil and criminal charges the union intends launching
against the Steinhoff’s directors and prescribed officials owing to pension
investment losses suffered by PSA members following Steinhoff’s collapse,” the
association said in a statement on Wednesday.The NHRA, in a separate media release, said it was “currently in
discussions with the PSA with regards to the Sun Met and Mr Markus Jooste’s
participation”.“Further announcements will be made after the discussions with the
PSA have been concluded,” it said.https://www.fin24.com/Economy/our-fight-is-not-with-sun-met-but-against-markus-jooste-union-20180124
