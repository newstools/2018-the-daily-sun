I am focused on getting a job or study opportunity so I can live my life positively. I have been clean for two and a half months and am not going back.“My family is happy for me as well.”An emotional Seipati said she felt such joy, she was at a loss for words.“God is great. I never thought such a day would come. I used to have sleepless nights because of my son, but now I sleep like a baby. Thank you Daily Sun and all the people who contributed to his change. May you keep helping others as you have done with my son,” she said.
