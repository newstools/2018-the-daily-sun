A GRUESOME video showing four young men in balaclavas torturing a medium-sized dog in the veld has been making the rounds. The men are apparently from Donkerhoek kasi in Kimberley, Northern Cape. One of them stands on its back legs as it lies on the ground and another hacks it until the flesh on its chest is exposed. Then, as the dog struggles to free itself, it is stabbed with a knife in the neck.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstYg9_bFrGRZkEpQ_pZzISnP7KxGRgWAphYMtUGNWoKLaHEwhg18HhPxlooMdT1DthELY-7MV8Q5jkZN-ouMqlVSBnNOBQof-BnosDAHZWM3ZK_9a-vsB-kap6Bkb06kmkAzEuJZuaczFWAp5aGCftycqtZKGWDKT9hB5-tmUxcjKjofisEAB7h4UW5HhYXJQ_CAbFLnBcXP8NXybEdnnsyUBTyPaXBHAoeGMry41DsfpT5baBuUBUMlfkrLPMflrMTqKwAAAURe34HpvkyDEG43dh9ktc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGE1HJGWC0KGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The carcass of another dog is seen hanging on a pole.  Now residents want the men to be arrested.  A resident said: “This video shows that they are going to grow up knowing how to kill.  This is a very cruel thing they did to the poor dog. I am worried for their future. They are growing up as monsters. If they can kill an animal like this, what about a human being?”  Daily Sun contacted the owner of the dog, but she would not speak except to say commenting might obstruct the investigation.   Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock said: “The SPCA has taken over the matter and is investigating.  “As soon as they have identified the suspects, a case will be opened and we will take the matter further.” Northern Cape SPCA spokesman Mario van der Westhuizen said: “The suspects will be charged with cruelty to animals.”
