This club belong in continental football and we want to see ourselves up there with the big names next season.”Before their home game against Polokwane City at the Orlando Stadium last night, Sredojevic’s charges had won their first two league games of the new year. The outspoken Serbian said despite being on the continent for many years, he was still learning and hoped to become a top coach.Sredojevic said: “Over the 25 years of coaching I’m learning every day. I want to move Mzansi football to the next level and to achieve that we want to play attractive football.“We want a competitive squad to deal with issues of fatigue when we go to Caf competitions.”Sredojevic added that he was happy with the depth of his squad as he embarked on his goal of qualifying for the Caf competitions next season.
