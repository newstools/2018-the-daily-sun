<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>It is a case of eat or be eaten for Kaizer Chiefs and their Tshwane rivals Mamelodi Sundowns in the fight for the top spot in the PSL standings.All eyes will be on Downs’ new top striker Jeremy “Mandevu” Brockie, who has promised to hit the ground running this weekend.But Chiefs’ Leonardo Castro, a product of Sundowns, has already hit the back of the net for his new employers in Naturena last weekend against Baroka FC.The goalkeepers of both teams – Downs’ Denis Onyango and Chiefs’ Itumeleng Khune – can stop goals, even in a tight corner, and tomorrow should be no different.If Amakhosi lose to the Brazilians they will end up eight points off the pace in the Premiership title race. As things stand, Downs enjoy a five-point lead over Chiefs with 12 matches remaining before season’s end. Sundowns can afford to take a draw but a win would open up a big gap between them and Cape Town City FC, who face Bloemfontein Celtic on Sunday.The Brazilians occupy top spot with 34 points, followed by the Citizens four points behind and Amakhosi third with 29. They have all played 18 games.Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela has underlined the importance of getting the better of the Brazilians  under coach Pitso Mosimane – like they did at Loftus Versfeld in October last year when they beat Sundowns 2-1.Said Komphela: “There is a big gap of five points. But a win will narrow that gap to two. Victory for them wouldn’t mean they’ve won the title. If we win we will be in contention for the title.” While nothing will be decided on the night, Khune said this match would be a turning point for his team. “We have to be close to the leaders, and this is the perfect chance to narrow the gap.” The Brazilians’ former skipper, Ramahlwe Mphahlele, is also poised to feature in his first game after a long injury lay-off. Mosimane said Amakhosi had turned the corner, so he would exercise extreme caution: “Five points is not much of a gap. We need to give ourselves breathing space. We lost our last two encounters with them and they are more consistent at the moment. “Leo is gone, we’ve accepted that. We’re not worried about him scoring – you can’t control such things.” Chiefs will be without suspended Joseph Molangoane.
