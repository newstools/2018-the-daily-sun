THE SANZEA Netball Quad Series ended on a disappointing note for the SPAR Proteas, who went down 52-47 to the England Roses at the Ellis Park Indoor Arena on Sunday.After trailing by as many as 12 goals at one stage, the Proteas fought back bravely in the final quarter, but were unable to close the gap.In the early stages of the match, the teams were exchanging goal for goal until a wayward pass by wing attack Bongiwe Msomi gave England the chance to get ahead. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvEWv9iaD3r-DTXfho88XsOqyPLgRxD2WdlAxAAFq-_XLg54wS_6ihHb6EutN73FEL2T_sljNaDu_aoP3WZ3nzdrWJeVffuPsVFfjJARNPqi55uDidS7nXWNfSXli64rWiHPpdYDx_JTWhiX7LCpuUo3d5VU6osD9l0CFpj98ZLLS2sRcCfGgI3WJmedVdQ_36ry6a75V1tD-JnGp9kz3L1og3p7t3XC1MksBK02nxIx0T4LrvH0ZXLtY04JT3ioYOiRHItqRwQLWXUTltY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHLAidVERXQIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The players have to learn to hang on in those crunch situations.”Captain Msomi said the team had failed to capitalise when they had the ball in hand.“We know where we went wrong, and we have to fix that,” she said.“But we’ve had good results against the top three countries in the world, and we feel prepared to take on anyone at the Commonwealth Games”.
