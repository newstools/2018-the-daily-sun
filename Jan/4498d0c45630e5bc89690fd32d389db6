But there was nothing I could do to save her. When I got to the scene her body had already been removed from the pit.“The pit was dug by my neighbour some time ago. I heard it was going to be a sewer but it had not been completed or covered.”The pit has since been filled with soil and covered with concrete to avoid similar incidents in future.He said the circumstances that led to the incident were still unclear as the other child who was playing with Olwethu was too young and shocked to tell the tale.“Even though she liked to play outdoors with her friends, she barely spent time with them when I was home. “I know she would not have gone out if I was at home.”KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident and said an inquest docket had been opened.
