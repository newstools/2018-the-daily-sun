The estimated street value of the drugs is R100 000. Police spokesman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said: “Detectives from Mount Road SAPS and members of the flying squad and cluster crime task team went to a house in Sakela Street, KwaZakhele. “They arrested a 42-year-old man while they were looking for items stolen from a business in Pickering Street, Newton Park on Monday.”  The cops did not find the stolen goods but confiscated about 2 000 mandrax tablets. Naidu said: “Early on Monday, TVs, speakers, cameras, laptops and other items to the value of R260 000 were stolen during the robbery. “With the help of a CCTV camera, the cops were able to see the registration number of the suspect’s vehicle.  That led the police to his house.”  The man will appear in court today on charges of robbery and dealing in drugs.  More arrests are expected as cops search for the stolen goods.
