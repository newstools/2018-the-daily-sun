one of the Facebook users on Tuesday evening.In a thread, the comment read: “Solly, former MemelodI
beauty kind, we are coming 4 you this Friday, bloody white puppet.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstjmRqwSP2V2W2DnRCu_wtichOUSqN2sob5HZzQTjojyDIpgxx58jl6Sg19d96XJlROb6ko5wfmoLBDyl2iz_Ladb2mqZqaSBLH1NLmoBvsG_ce411X4sU3PSyIE8lioT9cCO08aAJqf93JFu2sXttpLFNBPwokuXvWyQwBUDg5X9Rrcf9iUnjtGT1SinCZNgRA6v_9hNSV2mbNiFBJfXl0Spg0aJ5pGR4lk36QN66eXwKVLG3KJn67WJ0mmiito-qwFRh7q5Qwnrmoyc6Q6ICtDVg52Lk\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YTa0Nl8S8Kaxi1LIITnZTpNis6o1tG-S8kP4ydKZUCugUjJIREDT1RS-5b-VKU-sSqPnk_l-lsWdE8V2ccOrmEplxAJYyqi5J6PWhIpYA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIPhnPYcTEHyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

monitoring the situation.He also said that if the threatening behavior persists,
he will be forced to press charges.“This sort of utterance is completely unacceptable and
has since been deleted by the individual who originally posted it,” he said.“ I will monitor the comments made by this individual and
others like him who elect to use these communications platforms to launch
insults and send threats instead of lodging genuine concerns about service
delivery issues in the city.”He also said that the comment “was likely made in
anticipation of the march scheduled for Friday in which the ANCYL in the
Greater Tshwane Region have threatened to shut down the City in blind service
to their agenda.”“This is a march for which the city received no formal
application and should it continue it will be unprotected and unlawful,” he
said.“No person in Tshwane and SA alike should make or receive
comments such as the ones distilled above,” he added.“There is no place for violence in South Africa and it
must be dealt with whenever it occurs.”
