BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic Diski team coach Ditheko Mototo has vowed that they will not allow Golden Arrows to walk off with the title without putting up a fight.Celtic, last season’s MultChoice Diski Challenge runners-up, will have to be mentally fit in order to avoid the mistakes they made last campaign. The Bloemfontein outfit, which produced last season’s top goal-scorer Tshegofatso Mabasa, these days a regular in the first team, was in the driving seat for the better half of last season until losing 3-2 to Ajax Caper Town in the penultimate match. This saw Mamelodi Sundowns overtake them to clinch the title.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstz6axeBt-iRSALldsoHQDntMyxH66c_u7Mv58zbq5KBOjB0IKwUoC0lMbhZ4hhfLHhsMvQeeIhW-pmVWS_cfWKkK7f2rOXldKo_ByfyfU8mTDtbl115qbgdkW1-Mdh9dM0XW9Qbpx_t_XlS_UD5jO2kwH40Qs_TT1XsEiop-_0YvFDdzJ-wQY0_PdRDCB4aLLMCSR6U4yR8PSWIbkQitF6e_OnG6zUN-MxtPAHj8hHgr4xYtbqCfNrRupM9LjwYp8D6eNYpBlnKnN52zUh\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNZ6Oksgg_KgEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We don’t want to repeat them again. “The boys have taken this development tournament to another level – they know what is at stake.”In other matches this weekend, pacesetters Arrows will visit much improved SuperSport United at Lucas Moripe tomorrow (12pm) while Ajax Cape Town and Maritzburg United, who are mathematically still in the title race, will lock horns at Ikamva Stadium on the same day (10am).
