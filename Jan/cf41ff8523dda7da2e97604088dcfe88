Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said R120 million would be set aside to repair damage at vandalised schools. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssz1QUf08xLb2nAbM4V1m-Yp1EcUUTuqa2PhVEcO0P6HQyQ-pI7G5eccLdyr2aCsvbaIWRj0cF-CXrr7Fnp-lO3S_26aKFs6gXQMNeyS_F7RhPac9VaoVLn-mZRZhf2CwkzyciAnKtN8MTdrvw_FXmmc2vkZfKZ7_VXS_4wQwQvzB0--gIvSzWTKfqRXdHbmPK-K4GQIUxGwFdZxT8a7oUA-EU1xwQWmt4gt4-jkz85f0eLaDmMFKtq-X0ICQoPkr0lGBGFGLMwE5Hf5N-9UMYVteaUPLg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOJkCcEm5cD5EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Deputy SGB chairman Ntjatja Sebothoma (45) told Daily Sun he lives near the school and was woken by the sound of gunshots and an alarm.“Luckily, the security guards quickly arrived and found nothing was stolen,” he said. On Tuesday, Daily Sun reported a break-in at Gatang Secondary School in Mamelodi East. Vezukhono Secondary School in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, was burgled last Monday. The thugs stole chalkboards, burglar doors and computer cables. Sazakhela Primary School in Etwatwa was also burgled recently. The thugs stole four computers, CCTV cameras and the school’s financial books. A classroom at Heidelberg Primary School was recently burned down. Several school’s roofs were blown off during a heavy storm that swept through Protea Glen in Soweto two weeks ago. Meanwhile, education spokesman Steve Mabona said the department was concerned about the crime and vandalism taking place in some schools in the province.
