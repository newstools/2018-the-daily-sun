give what I have to less the fortunate people like orphans, the disabled and
poor people,” said Nkuna.He said his mission is assisting young people in getting
educated, he mentioned that he wants them to grow and go into business like him.
Nkuna said when he sees a person suffering his heart bleeds,
because he knows and understands the background.Despite giving food parcels, he also honoured learners in
local schools who performed well specially in crucial subjects like Maths and Science.Local traditional leader Bill Nkuzana said his community is
very fortunate to have a person like Nkuna because he is not only giving food
parcels, he also invests in young people's education.Nkuzana also urged other business people to emulate from
Nkuna to help poor people.
