business owners, managers or employees were involved in Mutavhatsindi's
killing.The company said it had assisted
Mutavhatsindi's family by facilitating the prompt payment of his funeral
benefits in terms of a pension fund.Suspect in courtAccording to Bartlet, the security
officer was employed by a company contracted to provide basic security-related
services including access control, biosecurity and patrolling. He said the
security company acted independently and privately.On Monday, News24 reported that
Mutavhatsindi was allegedly shot and killed by his employer, a farm owner, on
January 6. This was confirmed by Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay
Makhubela.However, National Prosecuting
Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane later confirmed on Monday that a
security officer appeared in the Krugersdorp Magistrate's Court on Monday for
Mutavhatsindi's murder.In a statement sent out by Tarlton
police spokesperson Constable Lucky Matome on Monday said at the time of the
incident Mutavhatsindi had been driving a tractor from the farm to his home in
Matshelapad and was followed by security officers.Matome said the shooting took
place in an open field near the informal settlement."THe victim was allegedly
followed up until Matshelapad were he was shot at by the security officer. The
victim suffered a gunshot wound [to] his head." Belief that incident was
'racially motivated'The officer later handed himself
over to police.Gauteng MEC for economic
development and agriculture Lebogang Maile and Mogale City Mayor Naga Patrick
Lipudi visited Mutavhatsindi's family on Tuesday morning.During the visit, Maile told
journalists that he was tempted to believe that the incident was "racially
motivated".He said the manner in which the
incident occurred was an indication that the alleged killer was
"hell-bent" on committing the crime."He did not even ask any
questions, he just took out his firearm and shot the deceased," Maile
said.Maile added there was also an
allegation that the suspect has a previous case of assault against him in
Rustenburg, North West."We still need to verify that
with the police," he said.He said he was
"disgusted" by the incident."Whatever the reasons, it is
not justifiable, it remains disgusting [and] senseless and we condemn it in the
strongest possible terms. We are also going to make sure that justice is
served," said Maile.Call for police role to be probedThe role of the police at the time
of the incident would also be investigated, he added.According to Maile, a police
officer had prevented an ambulance from accessing the scene, leading to the
death of Mutavhatsindi.He said the 43-year-old did not
die immediately after the shooting."When paramedics did not
arrive, the nephew said he loaded him in his car and drove him to the hospital.
On their way, they met paramedics who put him on a stretcher and at that time
he died."If that version was true, action
needed to be taken, he said.Gauteng police spokesperson
Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said police would not be drawn into commenting on
what she said seemed like "hearsay"."We have not officially
received a complaint nor is there any case opened with the police in relation
to what you purport was uttered by MEC Maile."Having said that, anyone who
might have witnessed or have knowledge of the said incident is encouraged to
come forward and submit a statement to the police for further
investigation."Agricultural organisation AgriSA,
has lashed out at the police for reporting inaccurate details to the media
around the incident.AgriSA president Dan Kriek said
Gauteng and Tarlton police had tarnished the image of farmers by initially
reporting to the media that Mutavhatsindi had been shot by a farmer."The police and the media
have an enormous responsibility to ensure that crime-related incidents and the
identity of the guilty parties are correctly reported," Kriek said in a
statement.https://www.news24.com/Video/SouthAfrica/News/those-white-men-didnt-have-to-shoot-him-community-member-where-farm-worker-was-murdered-20180110
