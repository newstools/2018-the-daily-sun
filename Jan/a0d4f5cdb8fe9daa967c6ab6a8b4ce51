He said three men were stealing from a local hardware store on Saturday night when they were frightened by a security light and ran away. They ran through shacks around the shop but one of the men went in the wrong direction and fell into a water trench on a construction site. Masela said the man was identified by one of his friends, which led to a confession that they had been trying to steal gas cylinders from the shop. The police arrested the friend and charged him with theft. He said two gas cylinders the three were trying to steal were found but 20 are still missing. They were believed to be in the possession of the third suspect, who is still at large The police appealed to the community to help arrest the third suspect and find the missing goods. “This is a lesson. We appeal to the community to work with the police to reduce these kinds of incidents for the safety of everyone,” said Masela. He said the arrested suspect would appear in court soon.
