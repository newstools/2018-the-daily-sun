Dear MizzBI am a 24-year-old guy and I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for seven months.   My problem is that I didn’t see her the whole of last month. She told me she wanted space to have fun during the festive season.   I am worried that she might have cheated on me.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Umswenko-Wasesun&sz=300x250&c=445449944&t=artid%3d082a61ae-87cc-4368-8307-f9f1f4c427b9%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Umswenko-Wasesun&sz=300x250&c=445449944&t=artid%3d082a61ae-87cc-4368-8307-f9f1f4c427b9%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>- ConfusedDear ConfusedYour girlfriend doesn’t seem to be as invested in the relationship as you are. She has shown you the type of woman that she is, so you should decide if this is the kind of woman you want to build a life with. It’s vital to be with someone that wants to share their life with you, in every season. Don’t allow anyone to treat you badly because you love them! You deserve better.
