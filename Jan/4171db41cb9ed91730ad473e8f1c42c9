Amir Adams (36) told the SunTeam he travelled all the way from Worcester: “I came with my entire family because nobody wants to miss such a great event. It helps set the tone for the year. When you start on a high note, you overcome many of your challenges.” Kaapse Klopse Karnival Association director Muneeb Gambeno said people had a feast for the eyes. “The minstrels’ carnival, or Cape Town Street Parade, includes all sorts of artistic expressions.” Entertainers included Loukmaan Adams, Austin Rose, Monox Adams, The Woodstock Darlings, the Tiervlei Vastrappers van Ravensmead, NovaCaine and more. Brigadier Hansia Hansraj said cops were set up at strategic points for safety.
