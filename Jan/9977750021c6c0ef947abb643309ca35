THE Dube Brothers are bringing a new flavour to the music scene.Brothers Mtho (29), Sihle (26) and Buhle Dube (20) are ready to release their second album after the success of their debut Step Up, released four years ago.Buhle told SunBuzz said they were inspired by their father, Benjamin Dube.If it weren’t for his involvement in music, he doubts they would have chosen this path.“Our father inspired us to spread the word of God through music.“We chose gospel because it has a permanent impact on people.“It is not like other genres.“It enables you to receive Christ through music.”Their new single Blessed was released two weeks ago.The song is a declaration about becoming prosperous.They claim it wasn’t by chance that they were lucky and experienced success.Buhle said: “This song talks about being blessed by God.“People are receiving it very well, especially the younger generation of believers.“It brings colour to the industry because of its sound.“Our sound is urban and still has a traditional Western touch.“The single has a hip hop influence,” he said.Buhle said when they make music, they come together and brainstorm their ideas.“We are three different individuals and that is what makes our writing process so much fun.“We come up with different ideas and merge them.“We brainstorm the type of sounds we want and people then hear them on our album.“We will be launching it at Soweto Theatre on 11 February.”Buhle said their new album will show how they have grown as people and their deeper understanding of music and God.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuiaqP9sk--tV5bppA_J6rRE7yVUTJEfRk_5z853atojHl-g7-RvjWXaNxdIoOm4V_x4U5enW1MDnJTVgWDI-JdMgia4PcgqXftgupqk7uawRc8uyNjRcyLUdrpm19biUh4_KbUwPOI3yK81YeRpLS5gzlsvemdcaWyYipo0vbE0K9Zzr5yfVxGo7KdKTcVmY6IOGJKkJMF1sdeUjDTc1fY0f540LwwSQD_ntUsEdy376JrkCYij15ghNPIsRZHcsSDEECGVl2bKAc4j4O2TPDcQR7kBAzRX4HqPQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM_427FmxRk0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
