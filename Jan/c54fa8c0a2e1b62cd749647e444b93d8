ORLANDO Pirates coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic is concerned about his side’s lack of consistency.The Serbian made this statement after Pirates rescued a point when they held Polokwane City to a late 1-1 draw in an Absa Premiership match at Orlando Stadium on Saturday.Lyle Foster cancelled out Dominic Chungwa’s first half goal in the dying minutes to give Bucs fans something to cheer about.A lot was expected from Bucs, who started the second round of the Premiership like a house on fire, recording impressive back-to-back 3-1 victories over Baroka FC and Mamelodi Sundowns.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstihjodp_WOdUJcnUnR8gLyoVy8JrM3ufUBGgXWp1rM-F6FkiXMUodEznG_yPu-Rb2ZWI5eNEP7Gz2DdrUXHylOxNv9CnarZEQWGj4xPpxPJucN9oyKcasfSTjFZ_ki5svs-mDydF-mtnCt-4s-b8UyE_Fi5gQPcP3U3Bs9OXDyri9erCZUaM1kqUIM38gydTN6Fe16NS8ZTgzcdi2Dx8TtrvBS1ZLOaml_T-xOHdIF7ZC8QqZuOto3WtTbC14BAbNNEL2AlJ1bImxHAFUmbqPV-A\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFeENPUVE9qZEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

You could see we went two steps forward and one step back. “We have been a bit complacent and needed to dig deeper in order to win.”Pirates have collected 27 points from 18 league matches. They are seven points behind Downs who are at the top of the Premiership standings with 34 points.Sredojevic hopes Bucs will pick up the pieces when they visit struggling Platinum Stars at Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Saturday.He said: “We expect our next matches to be much better. We’ll do everything possible in all aspects such as technical awareness and mental strength to keep  consistency.”
