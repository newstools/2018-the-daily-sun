We’re happy associations are working hand in hand with us.” Community Safety MEC Makoma Makhurupetje said South Africa’s road safety is everyone’s responsibility.“As the department we have had several roadblocks throughout the province during the festive season.“We’re happy the number of road deaths is lower when compared to the 2016 figures.”
