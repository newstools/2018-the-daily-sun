When we asked who it was, they hung up.“She said she was woken by a scary sound of knives being sharpened in a flat in Sunnyside. Fortunately, she managed to run for her life.”“It looks like they were going to kill her but by the grace of God, she has come home alive,” he said. He said she was also abducted in 2009 when she was 13 and found in the CBD. “We don’t know who keeps kidnapping my daughter,” he said.Captain Thomas Mufamadi said a case of abduction was opened and no arrests have been made.
