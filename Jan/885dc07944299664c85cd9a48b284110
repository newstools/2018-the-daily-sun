    THE decision to reappoint Eskom Executives Matshela Koko and Prish Govender has been met with shock and dismay by the business sector.In particular, Business Leadership SA's Chief Executive Bonang Mohale has reportedly slammed Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown for the reappointment of the two executives.“The decision shows Ms Brown’s poor grasp of governance, Eskom’s role in the economy and the potential contagion it has on the rest of the economy,” he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvhs2MaIAkGtVSRl7nsa_IDWVAN6-8weUaGWTOEX2OSZNHHusSRzIqb1Wjq3-XKIkMXdYiRkNQEJGUHeD9tdeadXZIdWdUmNNPMiUE3s-2qLiBc1vZyb8lF9b-fk7uFzbYKxpii-SSL6BzaeUlQZ69FgUFQ0X83hpdH59mb8WEAvEwN1gngGSMvsqdClVa9ubnUHgeIUcMXVOh6KdE_zLS84l7BdUSxKgXtLpBtRbRGwOu-gfXqch25-grWWpO8jxIcqG_jwUOXd0vIWeKqp_07A6X1X4U\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDUqH1v-o1QpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
