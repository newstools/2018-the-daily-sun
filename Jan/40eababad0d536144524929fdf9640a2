 Miggs enrolled for a DJ course in 2000 at Flipside Records in Hatfield, Pretoria.

 And in 2004 he started his own deejaying school in Hatfield, Pretoria, but later closed it.

 In 2015, DJ Miggs was approached by Soul Candy Records to become a teacher at Boston Media.

 He told the People’s Paper: “It’s an honour to teach young people about what I know best.

 “I hope one day they can emulate me and I can become their fan.”

 He said teaching up-and-coming DJs and musicians didn’t only make him happy but was an astounding moment that reflected his true character.

 “Teaching is a beautiful thing because one makes a huge difference in the community and empowers the youth.

 “What I love most is seeing my students progressing in music rather than engaging in drugs and alcohol abuse,” he said.

 The DJ explained that standing in front of students was the best feeling ever because he was able to share his musical experience with them and also guided them.

 DJ Miggs Foreal is in his third year teaching at the campus and students are happy to be taught by someone who knows the ins and outs of the local music industry.

 He has made a name for himself as a DJ teacher.

 Some of his former students are making waves at big media houses.

 Driven by passion, the DJ sometimes struggles to sleep at night because students keep coming to him for mentorship and guidance.

 
  He said being a teacher at the campus is a best feeling because he can give a hand to the students.
 
 To date, he has released a few compilation albums including Foreal House Styles and Beep House Chroniclesunder Soul Candy Records.

 Last year November, the DJ hosted the successful Menlyn Fashion Experience at Menlyn Mall in Pretoria, where fashion gurus like David Tlale and Paledi Palse also showcased their latest brands.

 For almost two decades in the music industry DJ Miggs Foreal has done extraordinary performances in other countries including Gabon, Rwanda, Dubai and Greece.

 Up-and-coming 20-year-old DJ Thulani Masombuka, who graduated last year March at Boston Media for his deejay studies, described DJ Miggs Foreal as a source of inspiration to many youngsters who are new to the field of deejaying and music production.
