The men had come to teach him a lesson.Vusi was bundled into the Quantum and taken to the house, where he was assaulted with sticks, pipes and sjamboks. In a video taken at the scene, an elegantly dressed woman is seen beating the young man with a sjambok.His screams attracted neighbours, who gathered around the woman’s home and begged the men to stop, but the attack continued.Then Vusi died.It seems his attackers then tried to hide the body by wrapping him in a blanket and burying him in the back yard of the house.A neighbour alerted cops, who found Vusi’s body buried behind the house.Zodwa Mhlongo (68), Vusi’s mother, said they are still trying to understand what happened to their son.“Vusi was a hard worker. He would never steal anything from anyone. He makes money by washing cars in the street.“We got a call to say Vusi had been taken by people who accused him of stealing. We went to the house and found blood everywhere but we couldn’t find Vusi,” she said.They didn’t know that his body was buried in the back yard and left.Pam Mhlongo (56), Vusi’s aunt, said they couldn’t believe what people had done to him.“We were shocked to learn that Vusi was buried in the yard. His grave was covered in weeds to hide what was under it. His body was wrapped in a blanket,” she said.Police spokesman Captain Mbulaheni Netshivhodza said a woman suspect has been arrested.“We can confirm that a 52-year-old woman was arrested. Police are investigating a case of murder that took place in Jabulani, Soweto. The suspect remains in custody pending police investigations. “She will be appearing in court soon,” said Captain Netshivhodza.
