years later. He strangled Yvonne Bennett with a belt at their home in London.
He was sentenced to a few years in a psychiatric unit.After his release, he met mum-of-four Best in 1995. Best was
reportedly unaware of his previous killings but discovered the truth in some
letters.At the time of her death, Best had ended the relationship
and was involved with another man. Johnson started stalking her.On 14 December, Best made the fatal decision to visit
Johnson at his home. When she didn’t answer her kids’ calls later, the cops
searched his home.They found her body in his living room. A post-mortem
showed she had been slammed at least six times on the head with a hammer.Hours after killing her, Johnson threw himself in front
of a train. He survived, but both his arms were sliced off.Prosecutor Mark Heywood said in the most recent trial:
“This is a man who is controlling and violent to the women in his life and who,
when crossed, will kill.”“Best did nothing whatsoever to bring any violence in her
direction: she had gone to his home to help him with an appointment he had that
day.“Instead of accepting her help the defendant set on her
with brutal, merciless violence. He did it for a simple reason: after all that
time she was no longer prepared to remain with him and his controlling ways.“She had recently met another and began a new chapter in
her life, seeing that other man. The defendant is someone who would rather that
she did not live if that life was to be with anyone but him. And so, quite
simply he killed her.”He will be sentenced soon.
