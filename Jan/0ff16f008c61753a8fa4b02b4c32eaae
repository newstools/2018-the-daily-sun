SUPERSPORT UNITED’s star defender Aubrey Modiba didn’t expect to be leading the club’s goal-scoring charts midway through their league campaign.Being Matsatsantsa a Pitori’s top-scorer with five goals in 15 matches has caught the Limpopo-based footballer by surprise.With goal poachers such as Thabo Mnyamane, Bradley Grobler, Kingston Nkhatha, Thuso Phala and Jeremy Brockie, who left to join rivals Mamelodi Sundowns earlier in the week at the club’s disposal, the 22-year-old didn’t expect to have more goals.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstspf985rbgJKWGBgwE1PR3ltGgnnyHWQeOIgYRlsfNVdrJfMidpQlKsf_m7qV32B15dbrbxj2CX7Ulm26JI_qUEFXq5vjUsOv7GYozOvPhu6aUvG61lm6gDEqc1xar2DJ5mMoynzZAybxD9v4yDjcy2MfmeFVYQ1r_V2TmnqT1Wa_AuUbhW1pNPIsVrBzVTVg33zNSalvTgOyN5Sd5Ndwhw8WZ0NDzn1OTBzNc_BtYkMsdo8gj_Y5LCu4_uY-7K4mZKmHDb7dkBmvO5KdPgQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzN3HogE-zzrpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I didn’t expect to score five goals at this stage of the season. I thought I’d score three goals the entire season. I’m happy I’m scoring goals and it gives me confidence. Grant Kekana and I practise our dance celebrations in case I score goals and that seems to be happening a lot. We plan these celebrations.”The talented footballer pushes forward a lot and capitalises on set pieces. He said it’s the team’s responsibility as a whole is to score goals and not just the strikers.Matsatsantsa are like a fish out of the water in the league since they were beaten 2-1 on aggregate by TP Mazembe in the Caf Confederation Cup final in November. Yesterday they played against struggling AmaZulu in Durban in the Absa Premiership.But Modiba is confident they will secure a top three finish by the end of the season.He said: “We have to keep pushing and fight for every point available. We can still finish higher up the table.”Modiba said he looks up to Kaizer Chiefs veteran star Siphiwe Tshabalala as a source of inspiration.Modiba said: “Shaba inspires me and am also pushed by the senior players at the club.”
