Mbewe said the suspects escaped on foot and the car was recovered after they abandoned it.Residents who live nearby said they ran into their houses as a shoot-out between police and thugs broke out.Mahlomola Ramphele (25) said the area is becoming dangerous as it was the second shoot-out in two weeks. “You could be hit by a stray bullet while coming from a store. “It was in Phase 2 last week.“Which area will be next?”He said residents should cut off thugs and work with the police to combat crime.“These thugs live in our neighbourhoods. We must expose them and inform the authorities before someone is injured. We’ve had enough of their evil ways.”Mbewe urged SunReaders who have information about the incident to call 08600 10111 or 012 815 7080.
