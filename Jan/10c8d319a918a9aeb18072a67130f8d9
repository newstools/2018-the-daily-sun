noted that the displacement of learners could potentially increase towards the
end of this week as many prospective learners will be returning from the
holiday period, which may lead to further overcrowding on the first day of the
academic year.“We can confirm that Polokwane has the highest
number of stranded learners, with 6 996, followed by Musina with 3 028,
Ba-Phalaborwa with 1 747 and Tubatse with 1 016," Smalle said.He said he has identified the root cause of
overcrowding in certain schools largely as a result of the lack of quality
education and opportunities within recreational activities these areas.

However, he said the DA urges the department to actively
pursue establishing more schools in urban areas, as the demands for
urbanisation and a growing economy requires more schools to be built."The DA is deeply concerned that overcrowding,
especially in quintile 1, 2 & 3 schools across the province, may affect the
quality of education offered and hamper future educational outcomes,"
Smalle said.Limpopo Department of Education spokesperson
Sam Makondo said the department is busy especially in the hotspot areas like
Polokwane.
