It was an easy decision for me to make because I’m always looking for new and exciting ways to help my community. My job is to simply share my thoughts on how people can set themselves economically free. It’s simple, if you have items that you hardly use, somebody out there needs them. OLX baba, OLX,” said Skhumba. Talking about the campaign, OLX South Africa’s Country Manager, Thembani Biyam says “We wanted to strike a balance in not taking ourselves too seriously while addressing a topic that’s important to everyone in an engaging, relevant way. We want to show people that OLX offers a fast, simple, safe and local way of being financially smart”.
