We are playing a team that doesn’t concede easily.”As far as their defensive record goes, United have conceded the fewest goals this season, letting in only 10 in all 18 of their matches. They are just ahead of Chippa and Kaizer Chiefs, both on 11 from the same number of matches. But while the Chilli Boys are defensively strong they will be looking to improve in terms of scoring. They have scored 14 goals, while United are good net-busters, having scored 21.United have scored nine goals this year alone, conceding just one in three matches. Chippa have only scored three and have let in one in the same number of matches.Said Davids: “The consistency I want from players is not only for the coming match but for all upcoming matches. “We are already in the top eight. To maintain that we need to be consistent performers. “Against Chippa we will need to give a good and strong performance. We are playing an unpredictable team who are good in attack. I expect my senior players such as  Evans Rusike and Bevan Fransman to continue leading our young stars.”
