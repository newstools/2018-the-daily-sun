Meanwhile, LifeLine is on standby to offer counselling to nervous matrics. Counselling manager Nicole Imerman said: “Some will be happy and those whose results don’t favour them will think suicide is an option and it isn’t.” She said young people often find themselves under pressure from society to do well in their final exams. She urged parents to support and speak to their children as soon as they notice behavioural changes.“They should keep lines of communication open.” Those feeling down can go to LifeLine centres in Alexandra, Linbro and Soweto.Alternatively, they can contact 0861 322 322 or WhatsApp on 065 989 9238.Meanwhile, the EFF seems to be standing its ground on calls for matriculants to show up at university campuses.The party’s spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said: “We condemn and reject the statement by Universities South Africa that there will not be walk ins at universities.” Higher Education and Training Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize said: “There is no way in which a person can walk in and expect to be registered.”
