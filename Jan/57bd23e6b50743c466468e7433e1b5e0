They go into the Absa Premiership encounter against Golden Arrows, at the Princess Magogo Stadium on Sunday, a bit fragile and another defeat would further knock their waning confidence. “What we’ve achieved means nothing. It’s about the now. The challenge now is we need to collect points,” said Tinkler.More than the loss, it’s the manner in which Matsatsantsa meekly capitulated to the Clever Boys, which concern Tinkler.And without swift improvements, the Tshwane giants could soon be out of the race for the league championship.“Our possession is too negative and our transitional play way too slow,” Tinkler pointed out. “But you’ve got to remember that we’ve got one day to train. One day, yes, that’s what you have. So it becomes difficult to allow players to adapt to that situation when you’re able to have maybe five, six days to work on it.  But if you only got a day, you can’t expect miracles. Yes, I expect a lot from them. They’re professional footballers.”
