But after that, the taxi got stuck and couldn’t move.” He said Mthokozisi went to his boss’ house to try and explain. “When Mthokozisi failed to give him any money, the boss apparently locked him in the house and tortured him with an axe.” ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said paramedics were called by cops. They found Mthokozisi with serious multiple injuries. “It’s understood the man managed to crawl home after being attacked on Monday night and was only found on Tuesday.”Police spokesman Constable Mandlakayise Zwane said a case of assault was opened and is under investigation. “Anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who knows the whereabouts of the taxi owner, is advised to contact the Olievenhoutbosch police or call Crime Line on 08600 10111,” he said.
