GAUTENG Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa said  there was no way they are not going to be taking first year students in their institutions this year. Speaking at George Mukhari Hospital in Tshwane yesterday, she said: “We’ll take them. It’s just a matter of making sure that by the time we take them, there are finances so that we are able to pay for the bursaries, accommodation and training material.” As the MEC spoke, would-be nursing students clashed with cops outside the Chris Hani Baragwanath Nursing College in Soweto. But calm was restored.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstz6lUCm-QQiq0fOs8ZwmvcY4JXCcFULf4wU_0MLMaZMhUx_1SOltFvh8GGrBd2A4DY0Tr5pLwO7wYyLxScbppKlWUOdmnUjMtKlqhn4JAeFHFm6uUKoV1JVhfahvandtNYL7EcHNGTaFKxWST4rkWiiG47hqVgf5XnardG0-MI1gMX4JSJgzvkAZg16PEgV8TeqTzruiVH0IdTSwzi8ZRf8-XC3BGxU6X1jDUKDCg0ox87ZwHcM4hmhZ3BiOeHQ4x1ue7MrFNzpy1SQkQLtSvj2MiS2Os\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAsNBRQ0ae4nEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
