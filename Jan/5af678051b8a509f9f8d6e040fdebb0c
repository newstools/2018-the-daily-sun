WHILE panic about Day Zero is real, some people are grateful for the natural spring water they get every day from a mountain in Muizenberg, Cape Town. Residents said the queues started getting longer during the festive season, with people walking away with between five to 20 litres of water every day.Nomsa Mjova (35) told Daily Sun the best thing about that water is that it’s free.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv5aYGb2AJ1gQ9YjiMw8Vgh28hCaMyU7IlVELSZV6_rmxHiyqzZO-o61cjAG8e6-Bq8HeP-BitkvRsYzQ14nEyVNxc7-eDCMyD-792dQQp0DioJcYI1NCFbD2J-zswb257-StfR0LQWli2xfqVT8iM4_QSjTqzo9hfYRZjIOiYArtuYGpsuNbHM7K4cWGQdDRafcwXMp4YkRUUS0fcoMOBNINI2hxCr97AI2xNSAS5g8ADzxzvzmA7uIVcd_U1fICr-RE6uUhhCQMslcrtV__8rR2a4d88\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzO2hnsYLz5P4EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

No one has a right to charge for it because it’s from nature.” Nomsa said her biggest concern about Day Zero was that many more people will flock to the spring.Lulamile Magaqa (42) said fetching water from the spring has saved him a lot of money. “I’m from Mitchells Plain and I make sure that when I come this way I stock up on fresh water for my family,” he said. Robin Kent Yon (23) said he was frustrated by buying water all the time.“This spring water has been here for many years. The queue has never been this long.” Meanwhile the Day Zero shutdown date has moved forward to 12 April.Cape Town’s deputy mayor Ian Neilson said: “It is still possible to push back Day Zero if we all stand together now and change our current path. Now is the time to do so.”DA Leader Mmusi Maimane said on Wednesday that dam levels are currently at 27,2% with 17,2% usable water.“If we stick to the maximum use of 50 litres per day, we can push Day Zero out. “Every day, I want you to join me to defeat Day Zero. “But I’m going to do more. I’m going to ask my wife and two kids to do more. “We will aim to use 40 litres a day. It will be hard but far easier than the taps running dry.”
