People have accused her of not running the centre properly and of serving protection orders on anyone who opposes her. Zone 1 resident Rejoice Mphiwe (45) said the manager will never set foot in the centre again. She claimed the manager behaved like a dictator and abused centre resources. Rejoice told the People’s Paper: “We are not going to be yes men.“If we don’t approve of her abusing the resources of our people, we will tell her!” She claimed the manager was hardly in her office.“If anyone dares tell her to stop, she runs to the police. And they come running to serve a protection order while crime is escalating.” She claimed people wanted the education department to remove the manager and appoint a permanent manager. “She has been acting for too long and during her time, the centre’s performance went down. “The buildings are crumbling and the garden is untended. We suspect she spends the money on herself,” she claimed. Education spokesman Steve Mabona said officials called the district office to find out what happened.
