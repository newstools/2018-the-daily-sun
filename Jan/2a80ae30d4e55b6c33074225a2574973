SIBONGILE Madonsela is pleading with Umkhonto we Sizwe Veterans to help bring back her brother’s remains from Angola.Sibongile (59) from Umlazi, south of Durban told Daily Sun her brother Sikhumbuzo Madonsela died in Angola and his remains never were brought home for reburial.She said her brother left home in 1982 to join the ANC’s armed wing.“We didn’t hear from him after he left until we heard from other members he died in a camp while they were in Angola.“We have tried to get his remains back home with no luck.“We know if we get his remains back we will have closure.”Sibongile said although they never have had any bad dreams, they need to bury him here in Mzansi so he can rest in peace in his place of birth.MK veteran Themba Ngobese said he knew Sikhumbuzo, who died while he was with him in Angola in 1985.He said he and Sikhumbuzo were on their way to their camp in Kibashe, Angola when they were attacked by members of military leader Jonas Savimbi’s Unita.Sikhumbuzo was shot and died.“I know where he was buried so I could help to point out his grave,” said Themba.MK Veterans Association chairman Themba Mavundla said members who died fighting apartheid but whose remains were never returned should be brought home.“We will never rest until we bring back all the remains of the soldiers we knew,” said Mavundla.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstui9sIy-9h-6_J0ynXAd4V6KCzwEIxt955oHUgMBuwK8ZtjHWE8mSP5e19p8VxSvUALhwS4vvBT6-yjiR8BPW4xsEd1R8Zprw1DnJrO0QXBBydjz8dvIVdkNt9ok8mkP_zz3r0FDdojmC5Rrp9VjP6ME7zzilDNkmjm70V8KoUAjyR00cTeA9KbzxnDRP-DL5j_XQtN8olLJ-PqdF7G1G8D1d1z2fqtsR0gvgXfD68CYXu4s9q8DaBpv_m0fa52StqWJmabkUG7fQy1n-vHxm3aP8Upls\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHTF6YlkxoQWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
