After she had been granted bail, the woman admitted that she made up the story to cover up her extramarital affair.She said she had planned the abduction and the baby had been taken by the biological father, not unknown hijackers, as she had previously told cops.The mother told social workers that she had a brief affair and fell pregnant.When baby Siwaphiwe was born, questions were raised by her husband and extended family members.The little girl, who is now 11 months old, was immediately removed from her mother after the arrest and placed in care.However in December a childrenâ€™s court magistrate ordered that Siwaphiwe, who is now in the care of the Mbambo family, be returned to her mother with the supervision of a social worker.During her sentencing yesterday, Mbambo covered her face with a cloth and shied away from the media.
