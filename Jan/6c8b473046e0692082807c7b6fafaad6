<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Mbambo sent the entire province on a serious panic in March last year when she announced that she had been hijacked at Greyville and the hijackers had driven away with her daughter.She gave several interviews to the media, including a radio interview, pleading with whoever took her child to please return her safely.The car that she claimed had been hijacked was later found but the baby was not there.When the cops followed up on the matter, things did not add up in her story of the hijacking and the abduction of her baby.Mbambo was immediately arrested and several fellow residents who had initially sympathised with her were angry that she had worried them all for nothing. After she had been granted bail, the woman admitted that she made up the story to cover up her extramarital affair.She said she had planned the abduction and the baby had been taken by the biological father, not unknown hijackers, as she had previously told cops.The mother told social workers that she had a brief affair and fell pregnant.When baby Siwaphiwe was born, questions were raised by her husband and extended family members.The little girl, who is now 11 months old, was immediately removed from her mother after the arrest and placed in care.However in December a childrenâ€™s court magistrate ordered that Siwaphiwe, who is now in the care of the Mbambo family, be returned to her mother with the supervision of a social worker.During her sentencing yesterday, Mbambo covered her face with a cloth and shied away from the media.
