You could see that when teams play with us, they are totally different side. I think now our players need to see that and be clever in our next league match.”He added: “The other problem we have is lack of application for the players and complacency. We are playing good football, but we are missing chances.” AmaTuks face Mbombela United in their next league match at Kanyamazane Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm).A win for the 45-year-old’s lads could see his side move to fourth spot which is currently occupied by Mbombela, who are two points ahead of them.Despite his side’s current bad spell, the Cape Town born coach said it’s still early to give up on their hop of promotion.“The good thing is that we still have 13 games to play and we are not that behind on points with first and second team on the log,” he said. “Teams are still going to drop points at this time and all we have to do is to won matches. “Bartlett also mentioned that they are still negotiating with PSL team with a hope of getting some players from them on loan. NDF weekend fixturesSaturdayUthongathi FC V Jomo Cosmos (Princess Magogo); Stellenbosch v Mthatha Bucks (Parow Park); Witbank Spurs v Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (Puma Stadium); Royal Eagles v Richards Bay (Harry Gwala Stadium); Black Leopards v Cape Town All Stars (Thohoyandou Stadium); Real Kings v Super Eagles (Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium); Mbombela Stadium v Pretoria University FC (Kanyamazane Stadium)SundayUbuntu Cape Town v Highlands Park (Parow Park)All NFD matches start at 3.30pm.
