HASHIM Amla forged a lone hand for South Africa as his unbeaten half-century helped his side to 143 for six at tea on the second day of the third and final test at the Wanderers on Thursday.South Africa trail India’s first innings total by 44 runs on a wicket that is offering pace, bounce and lateral movement to the tourists’ all-seam attack, conditions they have exploited superbly.Amla (54 not out) reached his 37th test half-century, in addition to 28 tons, and will resume in the evening session with all-rounder Vernon Philander (13 not out) as they seek to earn their side a precious lead in a low-scoring game.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu3wwGb0xZSSPnjUEUHD_oTaGZ5CHRP7nMvA5lqrtkgpFPSJtPHJ9S-pJH3qTq_MuMgNlP_nq4LAFMqv0KhdYOIj5D3-V7GcYJO-fRylNPK-jxyi0xrcqNqxAQVVgQBwgPslE4_GzI-g6iSgCrgkP3syhdQqxxZxHladMN54ExL741ZYWd4mGtJA_Ks9Sfg9FdSs29bNSYRBwjLQYnRdstZndrzpJOhLnEA6FLPE8ThRZlDyZ1nHjmVFDB-y85lZ6LrMgERVeBS4hk2fOvD\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzC1zWQBN1RNFEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
