I’ve been waiting for a chance like this to speak to the DA leader.” Another resident, Thembeka Ngidi (43), said they were promised RDPs but nothing happened.“We don’t even know how they select people for RDPs. Our names have been on the waiting list for a long time.”Residents also told Maimane they were worried about the abuse of drugs in the area.Maimane said it was important for politicians to address the issues that affected people in their communities.“I will take your grievances to parliament. This year has to be better than last year. I am very grateful that I started off the work in your province,” he said.
