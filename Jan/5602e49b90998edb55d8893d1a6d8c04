    AT 63, she is a pensioner on a social grant of less than R2 000.But the City of Tshwane bills her more than that for their services every month. Gogo Agnes Nhlapo of extension 4 in Nellmapius, Tshwane, is left with nothing after paying for her municipal services. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/National_Article&sz=300x250&c=1299936343&t=artid%3d4939d7b1-7b5f-43b3-b697-8e2acb2dbf3d%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/National_Article&sz=300x250&c=1299936343&t=artid%3d4939d7b1-7b5f-43b3-b697-8e2acb2dbf3d%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>She has to rely on the money she makes as a sangoma. When clients don’t pay, she and her two grandchildren go hungry. Gogo Agnes told Daily Sun that in October she paid R2 000 for services but in November she was billed R3 000.She does not know why and when she was removed from the City’s indigent list. In any case, she does not think it’s possible for her to use services worth R3 000. “Before I used to pay about R700 a month, but this year things seem to have changed in a big way. I think there is a billing problem.”When the first big bill appeared, she said she thought she might have used water recklessly. “I paid the R2 000 they billed me and decided to use water sparingly. I checked for leaks and used rain water for washing. But I was surprised at the end of the month when the bill came to R3 000!”City of Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said the city will investigate Gogo Agnes’ services bill.
