We see a small skull, like that of a baby, and a snake that turns into a pipe,” said Isaac.“The tokoloshe sleeps with us and we can’t even make love.”He said the noise often happens when they try to sleep.Isaac said a prophet told him he has a gift but some of his relatives were jealous of him.“They are making me suffer by sending a tokoloshe.” He said he was worried because the problem has affected his wife. “I fear that my wife might leave me. I’m appealing to anyone who can help save my marriage,” he said.Isaac said he has spent a lot of money on sangomas, without any results.“Some of the money came from sympathetic friends who wanted our problem solved.”Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said: “Some of the dreams are happening because their ancestors are trying to communicate with them while others may be because they are being bewitched. They need to perform a ritual at their house.”Anyone who can help Isaac should call Daily Sun’s Tshwane offices.
