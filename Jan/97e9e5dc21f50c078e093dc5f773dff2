    RESIDENTS of Siyathemba, a township outside Balfour in Mpumalanga, have accused Dipaleseng Municipality of depriving the community of water. The water problems started in 2011 with occasional interruptions that later became more frequent. The outages matched a decline in water quality so that, by last year, only dirty water was available, and only between midnight and dawn.Community leader Thomas Mngomezulu said the interruptions forced the community to protest to get the attention of the authorities.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstw2rksZdXId5nj-vDBMLZSxIUoJsGJSlyzXx3LDQZaJZSy4d24_ByE67qsO52GWNQQ1OautTW6rVYWBhnxnf5Cv-QPAP_g8NUC3oDCkKcimEZRgkRatxRk00-x_9ux2fJix22T6C_Gw8DszrLwlG0eUXz_ias-ySQ0u8SqlzV-gu_09Ok4XaNsIzRNPLgT9egCdDXOaqFrfprvCM_G-GlTliHIdw8WyQjidrXWq-w0GWz52MA82i5_YGODUuEbmpd7ix7x7ZEzBnU-U5OQM8vD9U1D6-Y\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMCa_GaOmQ8aEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We don’t know what is in there – it could make us sick or kill us.”Resident Mandla Mabuza said: “We have been writing to the municipality and going to the offices, but they’re ignoring us.”Daphne Maseko said she’s tired of having to wake up at midnight to secure water. “Tell me who is up then. It’s not possible to do that every day!” Dipaleseng municipal officials declined to comment. They referred the SunTeam to the Mpumalanga Water and Sanitation Department. Acting department head Masala Mulaudzi said they were busy with a half-billion-rand project to improve the water supply in the Balfour area.“It’s a massive project that includes a new water pump station to improve current water sources, a bulk pipeline and an extension of the Suikerbosrand Dam wall.” A team has been sent to find out what is happening and the municipality promised to improve communications.
