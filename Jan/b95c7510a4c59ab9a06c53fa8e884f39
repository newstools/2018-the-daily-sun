the court rejected Zuma’s arguments that he alone could set up the commission
and ordered him to pay the cost of the case.President
Zuma has appealed the cost order and the judgment regarding the duties of the
president to appoint commissions.“I
am concerned that this matter has occupied the public mind for some time now
and deserves urgent attention,” Zuma said.However,
speaking to Talk Radio 702's Karima Brown, former Public Protector Thuli
Madonsela said she is encouraged by the president's action to comply fully with
the decision in the report.Madonsela
added that Zuma complying with the order, two years after she had ordered him
to do so has implications on the outcomes."We
wouldn't be talking in a situation where some of the evidence would have been
lost, as some of the cell phone records are kept for a limited period,'
Madonsela said.
