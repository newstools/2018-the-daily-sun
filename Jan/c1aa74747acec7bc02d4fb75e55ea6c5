which contracts were allegedly set up and signed in the premier's office.Fifteen specialist members of the unit descended on the
premier's office and the head office of the Free State department of
agriculture in Glen outside Bloemfontein.It would appear the team is busy with investigations for the
whole day. It is understood arrests could follow.Kapong Ralikontsane, director-general of the Free State
provincial government, confirmed this to Netwerk24.When asked if Magashule's head would roll, he said:
"How can I say the premier's head will roll? The Hawks know who they are
looking for."He added that he himself was involved as he was "part
of the cabinet where decisions are taken".In terms of a court order, they had to deliver certain
documents to the Hawks, which they are in the process of doing.The searches are being conducted in the offices of the
premier and the department of agriculture.The media are being made to wait outside as the searches are
conducted.The Free State provincial government said in a statement
just after midday that it will co-operate fully with all investigations into
the alleged impropriety in the farm."It is in our interest that this matter is brought to
its finality to allow the Free State provincial government to continue its work
of changing the lives of the people for the better," said Ralikontsane.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/free-state-dairy-raid-hawks-know-who-they-are-looking-for-20180126
