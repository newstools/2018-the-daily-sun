FROM the very first ball that he faced at Centurion on Sunday, Indian captain Virat Kohli looked like he was going to be the difference. Often criticised for being a global superstar who struggles to impact Test matches against quality opposition away from home, Kohli played with purpose from ball one and immediately found the middle of the bat. He survived a South African review for an LBW off the bowling of debutant Lungi Ngidi, but aside from that Kohli was all that stood in the way of a South African procession on day two of the second Test at Centurion on Sunday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstpu1IrqKM_QIAcp-z0nZOsIKll2xpq2zkVwGC5llbIApySL_RIOlaZWaenmrAF8pNiyRRH6s0_ncBV_Go67ZT5pUDc3uqdNfCdPPLYKi6IFe4Bd6Abzn5hb9eIU-AynCWqvSXpXHzEDA5X_CSmdyKWzyBZRfSIVlujFYuXoYS7I5Kp5BmQergVLW9L6V7sIa698x8uvEgp7u-Z6qcQ6BFMG--dGxZB3zeq2wFC-YCJdz54J6d13CXnUL-ijfuTQC6NoyAhZPFl1a9-Ds5F\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLz6aX9xHwzoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I thought he had hit the ground so I was very confident and then when I saw that edge I kind of dropped a bit, but I knew I had to get back on the ball."An inside edge had saved Kohli on that occasion, but he was faultless either side of that moment.The Proteas have made a point of underplaying Kohli's potential impact on this series up until now, but if they get him early on Monday, their celebrations will show just how much they value his wicket. _Sport24
