    FOR ALL intents and purposes, Banyana Banyana’s qualification for this year’s Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (Women’s Afcon) is guaranteed, says acting head coach Desiree Ellis.Banyana will play the winner of the clashes between Lesotho and Swaziland home and away for a place in the tournament hosted by Ghana from 17 November to 1 December.The top three teams in Ghana will automatically qualify for the 2019 Women’s World Cup in France from 7 June to 7 July.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstwJBTOkp9_xFjea0Xv61K31A1EUqO0G359vxAQ5jCsnFns3mCox3ERPHzpHgzxnD-UrBCDOZh46_t2WjNwfgONv5f5xJR1sYhAO5WngwS60Bepa7Ei-fGWfQtzJSeW-3xnjBrdaUARFOeKUZpAdbcFu5PWwiilBfgwPMK59yeAamn1DNodivDRe-bEQXAeNotJGYpmBGOVvfWSpjjCcGCXe7v3GJ3kUB4LVM4gRPJsHUBYem3gwmo7LPdb_NofwPdHdI6K5bqUd9-xOgMU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFdKNEhyX9k_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I have put all the plans in place and am hopeful that they will pan out.”Next month Safa will announce Banyana’s position regarding the Cyprus Cup billed for later in February.The 26 players assembling in camp on Sunday for the Sweden friendly will not be guaranteed spots in their upcoming Afcon qualifiers, as Ellis says players must fight for their places.  And Banyana, the African Women’s National Team of the Year and reigning Cosafa Cup champions, will not be eager to part with the title or accompanying honours of being the continent’s best.Sunflower FC midfielder Xolisile Mnikathi, based in KwaZulu-Natal, has been called up to replace former Banyana Banyana captain Amanda Dlamini, who retired on Tuesday.) Stephanie Malherbe, Robyn Moodaly and Nomvula Kgoale aren’t available for this friendly.
