I have put all the plans in place and am hopeful that they will pan out.”Next month Safa will announce Banyana’s position regarding the Cyprus Cup billed for later in February.The 26 players assembling in camp on Sunday for the Sweden friendly will not be guaranteed spots in their upcoming Afcon qualifiers, as Ellis says players must fight for their places.  And Banyana, the African Women’s National Team of the Year and reigning Cosafa Cup champions, will not be eager to part with the title or accompanying honours of being the continent’s best.Sunflower FC midfielder Xolisile Mnikathi, based in KwaZulu-Natal, has been called up to replace former Banyana Banyana captain Amanda Dlamini, who retired on Tuesday.) Stephanie Malherbe, Robyn Moodaly and Nomvula Kgoale aren’t available for this friendly.
