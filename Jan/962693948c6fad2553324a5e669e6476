A FOUR-YEAR-OLD boy became a hero on Friday when he saved his mum from death. The little boy and his mum were sleeping at their home in Umlazi, south of Durban, when a fire started. The boy was the first to notice the house was on fire and rushed to his mum, who was sleeping in another room. When his mum didn’t wake up, the boy tried to go outside to call for help but his gogo, Rose, had locked all the doors when she left for work earlier. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstY-vkOIm-SbMYYZqOjmTpb0bTElVMQ4l2LTrahmWdl7wGSz2ZSwqktAfDpDOoBndBssy15msB04FlFELn5tv8mQS7NSRPzyjl1tgf5KMAKJ1XOVGEAl30AphLzGLE5ZocnOXw9xmxDG49FRwJjqu8639q_fcbH67vVoKuKUDtk6Mb7-N2xyRRYLIY1LSQU6v675GGuvJ_dOvcRoi42X5B5sjiIn_ifl__RVJrX1nlRDw9ISx3W78VLccx0xFXhGkhEvxo10RfF37R8iWU7ZYG8dLkoQec\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzO4dWxqbdmXwEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The boy’s mum, Mpume Masuku (24), said she was fast asleep and only realised something was wrong when there was a loud bang at the door. “I woke up and saw smoke everywhere but my son and the motorist had already broken down the door, so I managed to get out of the house.” Mpume said the driver used his van to smash the locked burglar gate at the door.She said her mum had forgotten to leave the keys in the house after locking the doors. Rose said if it wasn’t for her clever grandson, her daughter would have died. She said everything in the house was burned but she was happy no one died. Councillor Zoe Shabalala said she had sent a team to assess the damage and see how the family could be helped.
