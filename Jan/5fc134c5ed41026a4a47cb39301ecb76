I will call them again today because we really want his services.”If signed, Ngobeni is expected to battle it out with Ivorian goalkeeper Badra Ali Sangare and Samkelo Mbambo for the first choice position. Although, Ea Lla Koto have done well so far to occupy second spot with 28 points from 17 matches, their goalkeeping department has been a concern for Eymael.Stars have conceded 17 goals so far.Stars host Maritzburg United in an Absa Premiership match at Goble Park on Saturday (3.30pm)Meanwhile, Eymael revealed that they won’t be signing striker Amido Balde from Guinea-Bissau as he is deemed unfit.Explained Eymael: “We are still waiting for a new striker that I cannot divulge. But Balde lacks match fitness, and he will take longer to be on the same par with the rest of the squad.“Time is something that we don’t have. I am happy with the commitment of our new number 10 (Aris Chilumbu) from Congo Brazzaville.”
