In one of the videos he gives the men R500 each and tells the one to buy food and the other to fix his ID.In the other video, a gogo and her granddaughter are seen in a clothing shop buying school shoes for the girl.But before she can pay, Malcolm X offers to pay for their purchase and advises the girl to study hard at school so she can take care of her gogo.Malcolm X said his actions are all in the name of giving. “I love to help the needy where I can. It really breaks my heart to see people without homes, food or essentials.”“I know it’s not enough but I try to give them hope and encourage them to overcome their worries.“I have blessed the needy all of my life and share with them what God has blessed me with.”Malcolm X is originally from Sebokeng in the Vaal but he settled in Sandton in 1988.He said he visits old age homes, orphanages and homeless shelters to offer help.“We also have a yearly initiative to hand out blankets on the streets during winter. Other concerned people and I regularly visit such places to drop off R5 000 as a donation.“My heart goes out to everybody in need.”After seeing the video of Malcolm X giving to the homeless at Christmas, social media went crazy.Elvis Meje wrote on Facebook: “Malcolm, I have learnt something. Since I’m not a church member at least I can buy food for the poor every month. You are a Good Samaritan.”Ref Wayne wrote: “Whatever they buy doesn’t matter, what matters is the hand that helped them. God bless you.”Thuto Daly commented: “Ooohhhh my brother! You just opened my heart! May God bless you. The world needs people like you!See video below:
