WHEN asked who paid for his trip to Dubai in 2016, former Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh said it wasn’t the Guptas.“Why would you say it wasn’t the Guptas? Anyone could have paid,” said evidence leader Advocate Nthuthuzelo Vanara.“It has been widely reported that the Guptas paid for it. That’s why I mentioned them,” said Singh yesterday at parliament’s inquiry into corruption at Eskom.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvjycXruh1oUpzRLvAwb3O9H-j2el729VHJ0z3Sb1iYe-bFTL2zQ5Fm3LxjWPyrgawom0Ny3_FlHhtZ4lsAz9F7Tl9OgWHbOxKroP9TsStS5efmxkOHlAw-A4nPBPOAKZCndJcHtLaGiD0SfmKCH4k7QHYsJp6P4g2itp99JwKRZrKhr_kjfHCwcYknXh0E3je9uAlAacb9lqmkJCO0_0yQU0L61qoEkS-chCLLUPRAoGCiTPhpyw2auWngztkdKlLPF5AhO1yxdnSWaiyQIQT3evOBJK0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNa-LdDGtzSTEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

However, an invoice presented by Vanara suggested otherwise.“Why is the invoice directed to Sahara Computers and not to your acquaintance?” said Vanara.Sahara Computers is an information technology distributor linked to the Guptas. Singh questioned the authenticity of the invoice.After a gruelling question and answer session, Singh said it was possible that he was in Dubai at the same time as the Guptas. He also said they might have stayed at the same hotel and possibly passed each other unknowingly.Former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and EFF MP Marshall Dlamini kept mumbling while Singh responded. Gordhan eventually said: “He is playing games!”Meanwhile, the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse wants Singh to face criminal charges and civil action to recover the “missing funds” at Eskom.The civil rights body said Singh’s resignation should not allow him to avoid being held to account.
