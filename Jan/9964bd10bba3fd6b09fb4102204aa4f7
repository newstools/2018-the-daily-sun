    PARENTS whose daughter died after they kept her locked up in a tiny room for about 15 years have been arrested.According to Japan Times, Airi Kakimoto (33) was found dead on 18 December at a home in Osaka, central Japan. Investigators believe that Airi’s mum, Yukari (53) and dad, Yasutaka (55) kept her shut up in a room as small as a prison cell since she was a teenager, apparently because she had a mental illness that made her violent.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstGRbIOs3ocNWYxsRzv6r0QA7FftY2sKbULy6eXFwBVhhexE7CyTTxRRG17tM92sAITs8uqc_NUDdorng8PE4nuNO3U4ExDAmzu9Y_-fivpBlvYwHEbMZ4oXrP5vgP_w7ExmiwOXuRMymgomnpAwzgrGRPTOqFmxz497OpbZTYPeY_FEZye7OAffw0AQVPp-DpLb-6XgAORRPWDHoe8CIJkOSkaAga85hmxzdNygaqAAmvyvh8vpP8ClsVk8ssWx1xwDqKgepOB88VkMHBza6cWqZtVhEVJQI1o7A\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOaktKak0F4KEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

At her death she only weighed 19kg. An autopsy found she had frozen to death.Some neighbours said they did not know anyone lived in that house, while others said they had hardly any contact with the family.There are state resources available to those with mental illnesses in Japan, but the parents had never registered her for them. This is most likely because of the stigma attached to mental illnesses.Masako Kageyama, an associate professor of public health and nursing at Osaka University is quoted in the report as saying: “It is not unusual for families of patients suffering from mental illnesses to think that the condition brings shame, and instead choose not to consult anyone and isolate themselves.” Airi’s parents have been arrested on charges of abandoning the body of their dead daughter.
