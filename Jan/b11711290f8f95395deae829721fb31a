want to say someone else’s name. I only realized afterwards what I had done.
I’m sure it happened to us all,” he said in a statement.“It was an honest slip of the mind. Sorry,” he also said.Sports presenter Mpho Maboi, threw her support behind Ndoro on
social media, saying that nobody is above live TV.“With all the experience in the world, it sometimes gets the
better of you,” she said.“It happens to even the most seasoned veterans. “I really think he made a genuine mistake but because live TV
doesn’t give us that moment to recover, it was difficult for him to make a
comeback.”Maboi also believes that Ndoro genuinely forgot Mangope’s name and
the autocue just had Buthelezi’s name on. “I really am not sure but it went south very quickly,” she said.
