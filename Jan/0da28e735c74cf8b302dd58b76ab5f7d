His uncle Moshate Khunou told Daily Sun: “He was forever laughing, and never wanted to see anyone sad.”Moshate said he last saw him on Wednesday afternoon.“He told me that he was planing to host a traditional ceremony. I asked him to lend me his big belly so I could fill it with traditional beer and would return it later. He just laughed at me,’’ said Moshate.“It never occurred to me that I was sharing jokes with him for the last time.”Community leader Tommy Mtande said: “We do not know why they shot us, because we were not armed.”Royal Bafokeng Platinum bosses said the shot that killed Kenneth did not come from mine security. “Based on preliminary evidence, including video footage, it is believed the shot came from within the protesting group,’’ read the mine’s statement. Lieutenant-Colonel Adele Myburgh said a case of murder was opened for investigation.
