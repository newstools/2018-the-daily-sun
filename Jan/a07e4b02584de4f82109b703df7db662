WHEN it’s time to take a dump, dozens of squatters on Majuba Farm in Bloekombos, Kraaifontein cross a railway line to go to the nearby bush to relieve themselves.The farm was abandoned by its owner many years ago and there are no toilets on the farm. Nambitha Lisaka (34), who lives with her husband and three-year-old son on the farm, said: “It is dangerous to cross the railway line because trains hit unwary squatters sometimes.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The squatters also face armed robbers when they venture into the bush. Nambitha said at night they use a bucket and empty it in the bush the next morning.She said they used a gas stove to cook and a paraffin lamp to light the shack.Nomfuneko Kiva, who also lives on the farm, said: “We want the City of Cape Town to give us mobile toilets and electricity.”Suzette Little, Cape Town’s member of the mayoral committee for the north, said: “For the city to provide services to the site, an investigation will need to be done. “We need to verify the land ownership, existing infrastructure and capacity available, as well as space and other geographical constraints. “An investigation of the site will need to be conducted, together with the community engagement before any commitments regarding services and time frames can be made.”
