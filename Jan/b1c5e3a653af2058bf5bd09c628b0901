a beauty parlour in a foreign country. She applied for the post and was
immediately requested to travel to Gauteng from East London. "On her arrival she was advised that she
will be travelling to Africa on Thursday," said Captain Anelisa Feni. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuUVmJ_HsBBAl9l6MdkFxoccRxswfu7zUPGBckiml7MyFbr83TuJVe1Of6a5gli8dmQTFYJJqMY0RqNVmLkEnlMYYWn-Xoh9WVuhk4HpBF3LHl01USEZbdnPvTNaczIovuKcf5tc4NF7q9sBw7dRUqTGAvwirWWk1V-Ho_BKtlq4-F8Qq7Vqt5h4sykJ2vYObXFLQf_TkkYN2cGcpVl8FsioSbNuTJmgsZZ8UoJoMz2XBHB9IRfO-rph6Yfk8lgw10Z5Ylh57z_L88azCYSyAo6VHDIhkg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGAXJhALdTPkEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

suspicious about the entire trip.  Feni said It was found she had no work permit and was
only allowed to visit the country for 1 month yet according to her prospective
employer she was to work there for 6 months.  The mother contacted the Hawks in East London who contacted
Interpol in order to establish the legitimacy of this beauty parlour.Investigations revealed that the beauty parlour was in
fact a restaurant. The task team  members
travelled to Johannesburg and managed to rescue the victim at the Johannesburg
International airport as she was about to board a flight to the foreign African
country.Investigations continue.
