immediately requested to travel to Gauteng from East London. "On her arrival she was advised that she
will be travelling to Africa on Thursday," said Captain Anelisa Feni. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuQWqD_laURfcVx4ZlLoY4kwENZKUCFNKi49MorWzsuIMg3mq_sKHGVmDUY4ycPh0DOqOUrwtLahQe6ByGrKHfuadUrIQS3vHJpyLYlXS5iklW17BSoZycwaU_-oMBGWAVHy27uozMYDbs0sHhinUWpTWd6-rVLgkmaZ34BU5pL1HTWNGgBr5axch4GELTngTVuU6QcREnPBft5PbgpduMGNs1YPjUrplOEX5zAw5siYuJxmJjjNrVKgymyiuN5obCfw_hCiHt2UAE9ycAXXaNKP6WiJ38\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBAm1oRl9PYqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

suspicious about the entire trip.  Feni said It was found she had no work permit and was
only allowed to visit the country for 1 month yet according to her prospective
employer she was to work there for 6 months.  The mother contacted the Hawks in East London who contacted
Interpol in order to establish the legitimacy of this beauty parlour.Investigations revealed that the beauty parlour was in
fact a restaurant. The task team  members
travelled to Johannesburg and managed to rescue the victim at the Johannesburg
International airport as she was about to board a flight to the foreign African
country.Investigations continue.
