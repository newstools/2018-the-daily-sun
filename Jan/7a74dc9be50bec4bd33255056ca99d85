banks in the area and when arriving at respective homes and these criminals
would then ambush them and rob  them of their
cash at gunpoint. Ngoepe said members of the Community in the Giyani area have
been subjected to a reign of terror by a group of criminals who were targeting
them from different banks within the Giyani CBD.The arrested suspects will appear before the Giyani
Magistrate Court on charges of a series of armed house robberies and possession
of unlicensed firearms. The Provincial Commissioner LT. General Nneke Ledwaba has
commended this Team of Detectives on the job well done especially for solving
such a chain of criminal acts which was causing a hell on the daily lives of
the residents of Giyani.
