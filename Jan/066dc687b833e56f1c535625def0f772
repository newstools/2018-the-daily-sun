intimate moments but hadn’t yet poked. Her “boyfriend” apparently told her he
wanted to wait until they’re married.At the time, Wang didn’t suspect anything. She met his
parents and things seemed to be going well. But the veil was lifted from her
eyes when he suddenly dumped her and vanished.Frustrated that she couldn’t contact him using the usual
numbers and websites, Wang did some digging.She discovered an identity card belonging to “him” –
which showed her lover was in fact a woman!Angry Wang is now considering legal action against the
imposter. She reportedly lent her “boyfriend” money and now wants it back
because she was deceived, said the report.
