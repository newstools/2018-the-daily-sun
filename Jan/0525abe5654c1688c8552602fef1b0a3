We had agreements with Rand Water but we thought we must come and fetch water since the kasi is still dry,” he said.Over the weekend many kasis held protests, blocking major roads.“The water has been shut off since Friday and residents spent the weekend without water. This caused frustration.” Khawe said the water was cut off because the municipality didn’t commit to its deadline to pay R42 million.“We sat down with the board and made an arrangement to pay R15 million on the 17th of this month. “This is only a short term arrangement as we need to pay more until we settle the bill.” On Monday, Premier David Makhura visited the municipality and requested a briefing from the mayor and his senior officials. Makhura advised the municipal leadership to find a lasting solution to address the current basic service disruptions. Both the premier and the mayor extended their apologies to the people of Emfuleni.
