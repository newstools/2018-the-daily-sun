poisonous but seldom kills.Among Dan’s most favourite snakes was one called Tiny,
which is a 2,5 meter-long African rock python. These pythons kill by squeezing
their prey to death.Babs said Dan had had Tiny since she was a tiny baby
snake, small enough to fit in his hand.Coroner Andrew Bradley recorded a verdict of misadventure
as the cause of Dan’s death. He said: "The most likely scenario is that
Tiny was engaged with Dan - I have no doubt about that.”It is believed that Tiny wrapped herself around him and
strangled him to death."She was coiling around him. There was a point at
which either she took hold of him unexpectedly or tripped him up."Bradley said the snake then hid, probably "because
of the shock of him falling or because of his reaction".Babs told the coroner that Tiny loved her son, and that
Dan thought of her as his “baby”.
