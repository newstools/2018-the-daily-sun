We come here every day to play until there is a winner.” Thomas said they first started the game in November. “The first time, I beat my friend by reaching the highest spot but he won the next day.” Asked if he knew pylons could shock them, the other boy said they were careful not to touch the power lines. The SunTeam asked him if their parents knew about it and he said they were old enough to do what they wanted, so there was no need. Tsatsawani Maluleke (40) said adults in the area didn’t know about the game. “We’ll do everything in our power to make sure they don’t go near those pylons again. I’ll report it to the local tribal authority so parents can monitor their children,” she said.Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the boys are playing with their lives. “Climbing pylons can be very dangerous. We urge parents to stop kids doing this.”
