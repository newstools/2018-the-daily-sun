THE tokoloshe that has been terrorising madala Tebello and his wife started speaking and said its name was Sweetboy.  After news of the new development spread on Saturday, residents rushed to the couple’s home to hear the evil spirit. Tebello Mapetla (80) and Makgotso (77) from section J of Botshabelo in the Free State have been suffering since last month. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuIq_WwIvL2zuHAQt80vOgU0fBjB1r3_T_E-IiEVw7jJYSwlfcIBDiiG2_xtXMh9ChyhKh7JzNWihCvKI_jEwsxB7YasbG-4FbEnf7Mr3bGBsFLoSXr_X41F2Dksx5bvDSq4ZFjrRJ_wz42L3twbrsiylffZ1nxAW-_hlp-JhvOnvaSnQ89hzPza0eos0sNFQt14sQkmzDwpVrglicdZGkrj9ovPdvkc2euDKQ-KsZHUzlKxtWIXj8bOKTEzczwBwtW5Z7GxL3a_3-cGJyBHjnEn-i04yA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJPGPOf7hbapEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Gogo Makgotso said she and her husband were asleep in their bedroom when they heard the voice of a young boy. After greeting them, the voice introduced itself as Sweetboy and said he had been sent to kill the madala.  When gogo Makgotso turned on the lights, they couldn’t see anything.  “But we still heard the mocking voice telling us no prayers or sangomas were strong enought to defeat it,” she said.  The madala said the voice told him it had been peacefully living in the land of the dead before an evil person sent it to kill him towards the end of last year.  “The tokoloshe told me it had failed to kill me with boiling porridge,” he said.  “It said it would use boiling water while I slept and claimed the person who sent it wanted my wife.” One resident said they tried to record the tokoloshe but it stopped talking. Prophet Maria Ledimo said the family, including the grandkids, had to be cleansed to get rid of the creature.  “The tokoloshe is now a part of them. They all need to be cleansed.”
