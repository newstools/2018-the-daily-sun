MEDICAL advances in the management of children living with HIV/Aids, as well as reducing the number of new HIV infections in Mzansi, have occurred with the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, a major medical success. Dr Julia Turner, paediatric medical advisor at Right to Care, said: “In just over 10 years, the programme, led by the department of health, has reduced HIV transmission in babies from about 30% to less than 2%.”Right to Care is a non-profit organisation that supports and delivers prevention, care and treatment services for HIV and TB. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Success/Health&sz=300x250&c=81458693&t=artid%3dfff5240d-74f7-4706-880f-40fcc111ec3e%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Success/Health&sz=300x250&c=81458693&t=artid%3dfff5240d-74f7-4706-880f-40fcc111ec3e%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>The mother-to-child programme The 28% reduction in HIV transmission in babies has been achieved by making sure that all pregnant or breastfeeding women are regularly tested for HIV. They get ARVs as soon as they are found to be HIV-positive. Babies born to HIV-positive mothers are given preventive ARVs for the first weeks of life. Birth testing and diagnosis The advances in testing allows HIV-positive infants to be diagnosed at birth and get immediate treatment. Since its introduction in 2015, birth testing has made sure that infected infants get treatment as soon as possible. Children with HIV Early ARV Therapy The Children with HIV Early Anti-retroviral Therapy study, conducted in South Africa, has shown that the likelihood of infants with HIV dying declines by 75% if they are given ARV treatment in the first 12 weeks of life.Patient database The National Health Laboratory Service runs an advanced database which identifies and provides weekly updates on all HIV-positive infants. This allows health workers to track vulnerable patients and start life-saving ARV therapy as soon as possible.Easy drug treatments Another challenge is getting babies to take the bitter-tasting drugs but scientists are also working on this challenge.
