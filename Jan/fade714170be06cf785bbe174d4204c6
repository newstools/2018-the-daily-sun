Men can be heard cheering and clapping. A man dressed in white pulls the woman towards him and pushes his body against her bum. The other men start shouting “Wazi!” – seemingly the woman’s name. She then goes to sit with her legs open on the coffin and continues speaking while banging the lid. Phumla Mhlungu wrote on Facebook: “Those men are just happy to see a punani. It’s sad to see a woman behaving this way. She needs Jesus.”
