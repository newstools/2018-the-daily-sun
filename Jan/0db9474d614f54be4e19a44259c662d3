He went to war; he
was jailed fighting for the people."Zhuwao's utterances came just a few weeks after Mnangagwa
promised to look after the soon-to-be-94-year-old during his retirement.Mnangagwa's government recently published regulations
stating privileges owing to former presidents. They included a huge personal
staff of cooks, waiters, gardeners and security officers, two houses, a fleet
of cars and four international trips per year. Zhuwao was part of a faction loyal to former first lady
Grace Mugabe. He insisted that Mnangagwa's government was illegitimate,
adding that "our ancestors are not happy with what is happening". Â http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/mnangagwas-government-is-ill-treating-my-uncle-mugabes-nephew-claims-20180108
