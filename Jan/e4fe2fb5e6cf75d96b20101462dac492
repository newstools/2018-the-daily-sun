The men have ruined my life.”Teboho said when he went to the cop shop to open a case, he battled to get help.“The cops turned me down for no reason. When I called the municipal officials to intervene, I was told that my contract had expired.“I can’t understand how it expired as I’m still paying for the site. I was forced to move my livestock to my house and build a smaller kraal. “I want the municipality to intervene because my contract is still valid.” Moroesi Gaba, a spokeswoman for the municipality, said: “Teboho is a municipal worker and it’s against municipal policy to conduct business while in the institution’s employment. “Based on that, his contract was terminated in July last year. “There’s a new lessee on the site who signed the lease agreement last year. “This was after Teboho’s contract was cancelled.”
