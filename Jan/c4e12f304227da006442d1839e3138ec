celebration of his educational achievements, particularly the Doctor of
Philosophy degree conferred on him by Wits University in 2017. "The affirmation of Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi is certainly
an affirmation of his excellent representation of EFF policies. "Itâ€™s a celebration of his courage in confronting
corrupt and sleeping politicians in Parliament. It is a celebration of his
great oratory skills, and ability to cogently communicate the messages of the
EFF." Malema said the EFF is proud to accommodate within its
ranks, the best and most influential youth, who should be role models to
younger people in high schools and universities. "The EFF is also proud that South African society is
beginning to celebrate young people due to their intellectual and educational
capacity, and not on how well they dance. The EFF will continue to be home of
excellence."
