Before that, Tinkler’s side had played eight matches without victory. They then returned to their winless run on Saturday when they lost 2-0 to AmaZulu. It was Matsatsantsa a Pitori’s third game in six days – and they looked exhausted.Tinkler has played down the element of fatigue, however, saying his players are professionals and knew they would have a busy league schedule after the Caf competition.Tinkler’s army soldiers on tonight when United face Polokwane City at Atteridgeville’s Lucas Moripe Stadium (7.30pm). It will be United’s fourth match in nine days and Tinkler fully expects his charges to turn things around. After tonight’s match the coach will have three days to prepare for their next game against league champions Bidvest Wits on Saturday. United will be looking to get one over Wits, who beat them 2-0 two weeks ago. Said Tinkler: “Unfortunately we don’t have the luxury of time to sit down with players and prepare tactically. As a coach you field the best 11 and hope they will win the match. We need to turn things around against Polokwane City. We just have to!”He added: “I don’t want to make excuses and say my players are suffering from fatigue. No, that’s not it. “This is the harsh reality of playing in Caf matches. League matches are coming thick and fast, there is no time to take a breather. But we need to soldier on and prepare for our next match the best way we can.”
