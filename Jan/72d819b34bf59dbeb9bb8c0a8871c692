Before we knew it, everyone on our dad’s side had disowned us.”DO NOT CUT ANY OF THIS COMMENT Martha told Daily Sun the reason the house was in her name was because her brother didn’t want his ex-wife to get it.“On his deathbed he told me I should take the house before the mother of the kids came back to claim it.” She said the house was being sold as it was not yet fully paid up.“I told the kids they could stay with me or I’d buy them a stand but they refused.”
