Dear MizzB I’M A 21-year-old woman. Last year my boyfriend and I got into a huge fight at his home. Things got out of control and his family tried to intervene. I was fuming. I started swearing and called them terrible names. My boyfriend and I later kissed and made up. The problem is that I’m pregnant and his family hates me with a passion. I am worried that they will not accept my child. Please help me to make things right. Ladyif(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Dear Lady It is understandable for his family to behave in this way because you disrespected them. You should apologise to them. I suggest you ask your family to go with you when you go there. You should make peace with them for the sake of your unborn child. You will be first-time parents soon, so you both need to learn to solve problems constructively together. Should you need to talk any further, send a Please Call Me to 083 323 1023. A counsellor will help you to deal with the situation.
