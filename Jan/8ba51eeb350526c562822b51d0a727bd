Mahlangu, the former Gauteng Health MEC of the allegations made against her.Testifying before the Life Esidimeni hearing in Parktown yesterday, Mahlangu said she did not run away from the tragedy.Mahlangu said she resigned because she thought her resignation was sufficient to indicate that she had taken responsibility.“I left under the impression that nothing was going to happen because no one indicated anything. I didn’t intend to run away, it is not in my nature to do so.”Mahlangu said she was never warned about the risks involved in carrying out the project and she never lied to the legislature.She accused former Gauteng health department head Dr Barney Selebano and the former Gauteng director of mental health, Dr Makgabo Manamela of misleading the nation by saying she instructed them to implement the Marathon Project.“The Life Esidimeni project was to ensure that we delivered care but clearly it didn’t go according to plan,” said Mahlangu. “I don’t think anyone planned that people would die or be killed.”She said she was given a positive assurance that the project was ready to be rolled out.She said the project intended to de-institutionalise and cut costs without endangering the lives of the patients.“This is certainly the most painful thing in the history of the health system. It is painful and regrettable. I want to express my sincere condolences to the families following the termination of Life Esidimeni.Mahlangu said that Gauteng Premier David Makhura knew about the termination but Selebano and his team provided them with false information.Mahlangu said: “I didn’t approve the plan.”Retired deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke asked: “The head of department did not need your permission?”She answered: “Not at all.”She said issues of food and blankets were not presented in the meetings.“I had no reason to doubt their professional conduct.”Mahlangu insisted that the first time it came to her attention that there was a problem was through media queries.She said: “I said they should establish a family committee and gave them my mobile number. That has been my standard practice. I don’t remember receiving a single call.”Mahlangu said when she picked up faults with a few NGOs she was assured by Selebano that they would be sorted out.She said it was a collective decision to terminate Life Esidimeni, saying that in government people do not make individual decisions.
