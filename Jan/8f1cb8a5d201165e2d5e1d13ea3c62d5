Last year, Prasa CEO Cromet Molepo and Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker visited Bonteheuwel and Netreg on the central line to assess the damage caused by thugs.“This is a war,” Molepo said at the time.“Several holes were dug up in search of copper cables, and the substation was torched by thugs. “One would think there are people employed to dig up the copper cables.”Cosatu’s Western Cape general secretary Tony Ehrenreich told Daily Sun a lot needed to be done to deal with the crisis affecting workers.“The central line is still not running after more than two weeks. “We blame the political leadership and Metrorail management. “They’ve come up with all sorts of gimmicks, none of which have responded to the needs of the people.”“We need a plan to fix the system and ensure there’s proper security,” he said.
