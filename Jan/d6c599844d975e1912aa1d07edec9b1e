The police questioned him before letting him go. The boy looked like umkhwetha, as his expensive shoes, trousers and top of his body were covered in a white powder.He told Daily Sun that he was neither a member of the Top Spenders nor Smart Tenders and lived in Khayelitsha.“I was rescued by a parent who shouted voetsek to the boys who threw the sticky stuff over me. The boys ran away. I don’t belong to any group of izikhothane.”A boastful member of the Top Spenders told the People’s Paper: “We are the legends and Smart Tenders should know that. We can’t be intimidated by them as we wear more expensive clothes.” The boy had to wash himself at the taxi rank toilets before going home.Eastern Cape Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said the department is against izikhothane and the things happening outside schools. “The children who dress in expensive clothes come from our communities. This behaviour doesn’t form part of any school programme. “Parents should look in their children’s cupboards and talk to them as we cannot allow such behaviour.”
