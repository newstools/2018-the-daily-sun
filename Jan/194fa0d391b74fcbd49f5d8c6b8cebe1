Such applicants will be placed where there is space.” Due to the cost of accepting additional pupils, Lesufi said the department has to consult with the provincial treasury to provide more funding.He said schools that were damaged during the recent storm would cost R140 million to be repaired. The revamped Everest Primary School in Westbury will be opened on time for the first term. The MEC also condemned attacks on scholar patrollers at Freedom Park Secondary School on Friday.
