WHEN the little goat wouldn’t stop crying, Polelo Mkhabela got up to see what was going on.When the gogo (70) from Klipgat in North West got to her kraal, she found her 18 other goats were gone. Devastated, she looked around, thinking maybe they had wandered off. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstTz64l7J0GgDjICBj0jT71zpU382DEzWwkyTJf5E9uWx4briVrTOTruJIF0MmYkeIXihNtNVnPDq8YFoKWiEhaJD3hUfu6uGac5SJj-qza0Y7k-Wb22-YV9sCqIqZ1fFBJqtt8X2QyymRSxa2M_j_VlNcC6pDbAkCRXodbkxkFCihvAba_hbDQLvIigGDmDX_aoIpXkxpqJ_ryDkx7ODWqsx1_iAeni04S0KdcSbc5-hOzA2gy1DUxxGP_yMe09pkyo-bmuN77oQGyFipxjZeRxrT51Eo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMTObfiRikPkEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They advised her to open a case. She said she usually wakes up at night to check on her goats but had gone into a deep sleep and suspected thugs used muthi to make her fall asleep. “Goats are noisy but the neighbours heard nothing. I think this is a syndicate of stock thieves,” she said. “My husband left them for me when he died in 2012 and I hoped to pass them on to the next generation. This is a blow.” Association chairman Norman Ntuli said stock theft has increased. “Every month we get reports that livestock has been stolen. Nobody has yet been arrested,” he said. “Police need to take stock theft seriously. Goats are valuable. Sangomas and people use them for rituals. “Cows are sold at shisa nyamas. It would be easy to catch the thieves if cops wanted to bust them.” Lieutenant-Colonel Adele Myburgh said Polelo has a case number for cow theft and not for goats. “She should visit the police station to find out why she was given that case number.”
