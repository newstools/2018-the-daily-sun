implicated in a few of the utility’s corruption scandals.The utility
was reported to have admitted last year that the contract was unlawful.They also
stated that their executives ignored advice not to sign the contract with
McKinsey on numerous occasions.Senior
officials including suspended CFP Anoj Singh, Prish Govender and Edwin Mabalane
are said to have resigned.The utility
has given Maritz until Tuesday to give reasons, as to why he should not be
slapped with a permanent suspension.Executive
Matshela Koko was given a choice to resign or to be sacked.However, he
has taken his battle to the Labour Court, and will remain in his position until
they appear in court early next month.Maritz had
also allegedly appeared before current CEO Phakamani Hadebe last week Thursday
to explain why the letter concerning McKingsey was sent.
