was months after Modack was named in several media reports as heading a group
of men taking over nightclub security, mainly in Cape Town, from a more
established grouping. The
takeover resulted in violence, including several shootings.Duduzane
and Modack were photographed together about a month after Modack, in an
exclusive interview with News24 in September, spoke about how he had apparently
received more than 50 death threats up until then in 2017 due to his links to
private security.Duduzane
is central to a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture, led by
Deputy Chief Justice Ray Zondo, that was announced by President Jacob Zuma on
Tuesday.Duduzane
is suspected of being the Zuma family’s proxy in the Gupta family’s business
network, that benefits from massive spending by state-owned enterprises.In
the September interview, Modack acknowledged knowing Duduzane and said he
"looked after" him when he was in Cape Town. Modack,
during that interview, denied he was an informant for the state as many sources
have insisted he is.Duduzane
did not respond to a News24 query sent to him via email on Monday. He also did
not reply to messages sent to a cellphone number provided and identified as
his.After
several rings, a man answered the cellphone on Tuesday, but could not seem to
hear what was being said to him. The phone was not answered afterwards.Modack
previously confirmed knowing Duduzane and said during the September interview
that, aside from nightclub security, he was involved in several private
security companies and debt collection.Modack's
alleged links 'from the top down'He
said he worked with several wealthy international clients, "foreigners and
big investors", and provided security to "people right from the top
down".Modack
had not denied working for politicians."You
get a lot of government officials in business," he had said.Modack
has been in custody since December 15, the day on which he was arrested on an
extortion charge in relation to the nightclub security takeover.The
photograph of him and Duduzane was sent to News24 outside and independently of
these court proceedings.Duduzane's
other controversial dealingsOf
all the president's children, Duduzane has been in the spotlight the most. In
August last year he defended his business relations with the Gupta-family."I
don't think they wanted anything from me. They liked me. As I liked them. I
think I’m a likeable guy," he had said, speaking with BBC World News in an
interview for Focus on Africa.Earlier
in August complaints of treason, extortion, racketeering, fraud and forgery
were lodged against three Gupta brothers - Atul, Ajay and Rajesh
"Tony" Gupta - and Duduzane by the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse
(OUTA). This was at the Randburg police station. An
affidavit in the matter alleged Zuma, since becoming president in 2009,
improperly used his influence to help the Gupta brothers in placing those
accepting of the Guptas in crucial positions.Duduzane,
it was alleged, had been sent their CVs.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/exclusive-duduzane-zumas-mystery-meeting-with-underworld-figure-nafiz-modack-20180110
