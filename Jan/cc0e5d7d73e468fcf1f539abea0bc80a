Police fired rubber bullets to disperse the resilient protesters who threw back stones at the police.Many residents in the area have said they are tired of Nigerian drug lords who kill their communities by feeding young people drugs and turning them into prostitutes.Maria Nkabinde (42) from Kagiso said the problem is the police have made friends with drug lords. Police know where the drugs are being sold.But Instead of arresting them, cops allegedly become friends with them and get money from them.She said many young girls have been turned into prostitutes in the area and were also being kidnapped by Nigerians."We don’t want them and we need to leave in drug free society,” said Nkabinde.   1/3
