    Two people were killed, and five others left injured in a crash in Pinetown, early on New Year’s morning, said paramedics. "Just after 04:00, Rescue Care Paramedics were called to the scene to find that a vehicle had somehow lost control and come to rest on its roof in a ditch on the roadside," said the service’s operations director Garrith Jamieson.  The accident occurred on the Dumisanya Makhanya Freeway just outside Claremont."Unfortunately, a male and a female, believed to be in their 30s, had suffered major injuries and there was nothing more anyone could do for them."if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssrV_kWIXEcEowpcoNzPpY0FdP6yJw-0r4b58JxgTMDXgerdH1ll59NVdEbbc5VKfMvh3A1TUGJpAu_hy2CDAOheQ12I85USDW77AIjXkyUCAUM5fnbR_wHZi6MCLyTZlpTnpcIWcwUtOZGcRBAC8iYd2B8JcTRgTa-UuNTj2nSnjGfh0ODSOW3DTwKbJ1JvTpHKMRopHSVdcSsHcH_i1Vz_BSdIOFFCaMWL-g8zfg2wgHOXJaFQ3hzBIva2O-BaxBXjxzYDOUWjX8HsRgucdNtGkZfBLc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJwBmHIyG4ZmEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
