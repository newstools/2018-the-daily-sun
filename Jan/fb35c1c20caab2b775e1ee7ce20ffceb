    Two people were killed, and five others left injured in a crash in Pinetown, early on New Year’s morning, said paramedics. "Just after 04:00, Rescue Care Paramedics were called to the scene to find that a vehicle had somehow lost control and come to rest on its roof in a ditch on the roadside," said the service’s operations director Garrith Jamieson.  The accident occurred on the Dumisanya Makhanya Freeway just outside Claremont."Unfortunately, a male and a female, believed to be in their 30s, had suffered major injuries and there was nothing more anyone could do for them."if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssYE4a6GVw94i_Buio-uHdzUBbKmclcFuQ0ApHpgvip04ALaFCZclhFxDMkt2YgKji7kUitc5KaPZ_nSYUzMOP9mvSKWmhUV5vzzVKl_BVymMdEPlUdnVK0TmX850NoO-wE2VbC63YEARkFNtExHMTtHHWALIMayY5bd0GccW73HIFqeWRLu8FrdaG6F2V0hmI_nmiLOEBNYcygeP0wBbUVscni4QivbmIGQ0FEh9twR1kVc9KqIW2EGzkMca0kkgvLfVO85TMZy2az4iR4oTxp5pDNsVQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBq3nUxEU62dEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
