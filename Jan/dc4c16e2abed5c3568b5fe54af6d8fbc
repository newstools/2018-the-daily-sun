I was shot in the left breast, right thigh, stomach and left arm,” she said.Andile said the police arrested him and took him to his home in Qumbu. “They beat me and vandalised my house. I was told I’d been linked to a robbery in Bizana. I was not charged and they let me go the following day,” he said.
