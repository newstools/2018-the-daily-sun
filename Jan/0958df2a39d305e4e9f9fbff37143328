    2017 was a good year for this thug because he and his gang allegedly robbed a cash-in-transit van of R5 million. Even after cops nabbed his three accomplices and his girlfriend, he still managed to evade arrest. However, the new year started in the worst way for him. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvs2-9dxtvO9nECDHBM-2f94JtUIsRneso6ASznpVyu2mGS4t8DfhkVAvgjrawAr7r-c3hwIZpCLzlWvT8DH4qtH1_L2jl1J8VoVIauUHUNCklgfeSIYKGwsLdfKX86KReNRqgV7smiTJZKcZffiq6LvsXVQGNpnCNvzsASdo3mGkrc4BXgJNt60-XMYvPmztjxGB8XWMs5DBo5BxH-PlSmVy1vGYqfs5pB_syKV34PIdgvwCAaBgitO2tiCC1PSg1quOf2nQl_mmHDVP0kEO9hP-EZFHQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPrxsxtFPqGiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Western Cape police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said the flying squad spotted his Golf in Delft.“A chase ensued and the driver made a turn on the R300. “He lost control and his car flew into a ditch,” he said. Witness Jeffrey Grootboom told Daily Sun: “I had to give way when I saw a speeding car behind me and a helicopter hovering in the air.“After the suspect turned, he lost control of the vehicle, which slammed into a guard rail and flipped over.”Jeffrey said he couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw the driver getting out of the car unharmed. “The car was damaged beyond repair but he jumped out of the car without a scratch,” said the witness.Residents of Leiden, in Delft – where the suspect used to live – said the police had been visiting the man’s place almost every day since the heist. “The police asked residents to call them when they saw him. A large amount of money was found inside his wrecked car,” said a source.Van Wyk said the suspect sustained minor injuries. “We can confirm that the suspect was arrested after a high speed chase on the R300 by members of the flying squad.“He is due to appear in court soon. He faces charges of theft and defeating the ends of justice.”
