    TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila will host their rivals Black Leopards in a Limpopo derby flying high this afternoon after receiving a huge boost of three points from the Premier Soccer League (PSL). On Thursday the National First Division newbies received good news after the PSL found Mbombela United guilty of fielding a suspended player, Mxolisi Mayongo, in their league clash which took place in November last year.Mbombela won the that 3-0, but PSL fined them R50 000 (R25 000 which is suspended) and docked three points and handed them to Tshakhuma. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssQKMJIUE0EFgJW4gC2ORMXAcuXQ4cm1fizQv-gvRVWYk7u-2TEL3MNJXSE9tZH8jqGqdDDDc5I8a8oAumyW5jC8DhT48gkaTd5JdcjGXa6DQ6-cXpj3RbB5e6Cl5GKRujRoGLvunEo3j5CYcopTUzql429_XXGosT0YnEeCvLSKXjPiwRrsnBwBYeVR1NxVC69tcoTp0WvqTGdoL_endYNJSNX4m15HYD24hfUrp4GbERbZoy2bnT7NnS4pw6uzo_uGWxoJA5uYOXdcy4OIIKDAw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOM_Qk3CJC2ZEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Leopards can score many goals as they can so we must not allow the play their normal game because they will punish us.”After 16 games in their first NFD season Tshakhuma have exhibited what damage they would have caused in the league if they had enough seasoned campaigners in their squad. They have collected 26 points so far, while Leopards have managed to gather 21 points from same number of games.In the first round the two sides played to a disappointing goalless derby at Giyani Stadium. Chokoe said: “At the beginning of the season no one gave us a chance, many though we will be donating points to other teams but up to this far I think we have done well. We will continue taking one game at the time and see where we finish off at the end of the season.”Leopards coach Joel Masutha will be facing Tshakhuma for the first time since he left them for Lidoda Duvha last year.
