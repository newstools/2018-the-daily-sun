The police had to be called in to disperse angry protesters. H&M closed their shops across Mzansi.EFF leader Julius Malema said: “We make no apology about what the fighters did today. We are not going to allow anyone to use the colour of our skin to humiliate us.”H&M international apologised last week and withdrew the image and the product, which was never available in Mzansi.Some people took to social media to say that the EFF was only trying to steal the limelight away from the ANC birthday celebration.Anoxolo Amangwevu said on Facebook: “We can’t at this time of rampant unemployment be doing this. But guess what? The likes of Floyd and his whole cohort go to bed with full stomachs. It’s sad how they think about the poor.”EFF members protested at a store in V&A Waterfront in Cape Town on Saturday.
