I believe I am doing a good job. “I don’t even think about being fired because if I did, I might get fired! All I am doing is staying focused on my job – and I try to get a good night’s rest. I also need to stay calm and not panic.”The 47-year-old bemoaned injuries to key players, including their No 1 goalie Ronwen Williams, as well as Tefu Mashamaite and Bradley Grobler, saying it too had played a role in their poor run.“I am not making excuses, key players are injured and that has worked against us,” he said. “We need these guys’ experience mixed in with our youngsters. You saw that we played mostly youngsters. “We should also avoid making individual mistakes, which cost us games.”The former Cape Town City FC coach admitted that losing their main striker, Jeremy Brockie, to Sundowns was a huge blow to his team.“Jeremy was our main goal-scorer and he’s left,” Tinkler added. “So we are looking for another big player who can come in and add value for the club. I am not talking about just scoring goals. We are looking for a player our squad will respect. “We have identified such a player and are working on bringing him on board before the transfer window closes.” Tinkler blamed referee Victor Hlungwane for their most recent 1-1 draw with Polokwane City at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Tuesday. Rise and Shine equalised in the last seconds of the game to break Tinkler’s heart.“The referee’s optional time was four minutes but Polokwane scored in the sixth minute,” he said. “I am not trying to make excuses. That’s the reality.”
