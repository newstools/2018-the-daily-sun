And Samkelo Mpotana (23), who wrote his matric in Westville Prison, said it was not easy studying in jail – but he worked hard and got five distinctions!Dlungwana said they were pleased to announce that last year the province improved in maths and physical science.“The overall mathematics pass percentage is 41,59%, compared to 37,91% in 2016, and 65,11% in physical science, compared to 57,76% in 2016,” he said.He said that they are seeing a steady increase in schools achieving a 100% pass rate. “There were 109 schools with a 100% pass rate last year, compared to 85 schools in 2016.“This is indeed good progress for our province and the signs are there for everyone to see that we are on the right track. The province has reduced the number of schools that achieved a 0% pass rate from seven in 2016 to only three last year. All these schools will receive maximum attention this year,” he said..
