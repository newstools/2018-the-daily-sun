MALUSI Ntshangase (52) from Piet Retief in Mpumalanga is a gatvol man. In June Malusi, who wanted to invest in a business, saw an advert for affordable franchises. He contacted the person whose contact numbers were on the advert. The man sold Malusi a franchise of what was called the Pro Car Wash for R185 000. He told Malusi he would have his business by September. “Everything went smoothly and he seemed really genuine,” he said. “I was excited to be investing in something I was passionate about. “I was looking forward to not only making money but also employing people.” Malusi’s dreams were dashed when September came and his Pro Car Wash didn’t materialise. He now wants to warn others not to fall for the same trick. The man who had sold him the franchise kept postponing. “He was like ‘I’ll see you on Friday’, then Friday would become Saturday and Saturday would be next Friday. “I soon realised the man was dodging me and demanded my money back.” The man promised to pay back the money but started avoiding him again. October came and went and the man kept postponing the payback day. “He finally gave in and told me he didn’t have my money,” he said. The gatvol Malusi has now opened a case of fraud against the man. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed police were investigating a case of fraud.
