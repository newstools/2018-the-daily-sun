THE five zama zamas were sleeping when suddenly, gunshots rang out. It seems somebody wanted to kill the illegal miners in their sleep early on Friday morning at Grootvlei Mine in Springs, Ekurhuleni. One zama zama died and four survived the shooting. One of the miners who was sleeping in a different area said the first shooting attempt was last Tuesday night. “The men managed to run away and the attackers didn’t find them.” He said they fired several shots and left but came back on Friday morning. “These miners weren’t fighting with anyone. “They looked for gold dust on the surface and not underground. “I don’t know why they are being targeted,” said the illegal miner. He said they did this work because they had families to feed. “If it weren’t for that, we wouldn’t be risking our lives.” He said all the victims were from Lesotho. Cops suspect the fight could be over gold dust. Residents from nearby Grootvlei Estate said they heard the gunshots early on Friday morning. “But we thought they were fireworks, because people were celebrating Diwali,” a resident said. “In the morning, we saw police cars going to the scene and then we knew something was wrong.” She said they live in fear because one day a stray bullet could hit them. Grootvlei shaft is closed and most zama zamas are working on the surface. Captain Johannes Ramphora said four illegal miners tried to flee after being shot but didn’t get far. “We found them lying wounded on the ground and they were taken to hospital. “One illegal miner died at the old mine building they used to sleep in.” Captain Ramphora said murder and attempted murder charges were opened.
