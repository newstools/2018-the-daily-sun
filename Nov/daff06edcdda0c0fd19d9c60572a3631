WHEN everything fails, there’s one refuge – and that’s under the wings of God. These were the words of Reverend Nditsheni Khodoga at a prayer service organised by the South African Council of Churches. They were praying for all those affected by the VBS Mutual Bank saga. The bank shed 100 jobs while many of its clients lost almost all their savings. The troubled bank is about to be liquidated and there are already cries from many quarters that it should be saved. The council of churches is one of those voices. Yesterday, pastors, former VBS clients and members of the community gathered in Thohoyandou, Limpopo, for a day of prayer. “What happened at VBS is a disgrace. As a church we could not sit back and do nothing. “We’re informed by the Bible that if we come before God and humble ourselves, he will take care of us and change our situation. “We’re here to kneel down and speak to God that he intervene in this situation,” said Khodoga. Pastors then marched to the VBS Thohoyandou branch. They handed over a memorandum to Anderson Mudunungu of the ANC in Vhembe, and another to VBS curator Nditsheni Tshithavhane. Council secretary Reverend Parkson Mohlala said they were on the side of VBS victims. “We consider ourselves as the voices of the voiceless,” he said. “We ask the ANC to address the plight of the victims who invested in the bank and those ripped off by their municipalities. “We ask that the victims be reimbursed their money as agreed with VBS. “We also ask that the employees be assisted in retaining their jobs.” The church gave a deadline of 30 November for the necessary steps to be implemented. “We’ll seek divine intervention from the almighty to instil the spirit of determination in government to have pity. “We shall not rest until justice is done.”
