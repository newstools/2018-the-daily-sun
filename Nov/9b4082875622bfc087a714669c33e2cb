THE SA Police Service (SAPS) and other security agencies will be on high alert leading up to and during tomorrowâ€™s Telkom Knockout semifinal between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates at Moses Mabhida Stadium (3pm). The joint planning by the police, security clusters and the Premier Soccer League (PSL) has been ongoing for weeks. A pro-active approach, which has already resulted in the successful arrest of four people, has been adopted for this event. SAPS officers and personnel are on the ground around Durban and surrounding areas to tackle the problem of fake tickets and resale of match tickets. Police will continue to follow a zero-tolerance approach to fake tickets and resale of tickets. Police and other law enforcement will monitor the event and ensure that there is peace and stability. Those who do not have tickets to the match, can visit the FREE derby Public Viewing Area at New Beach (top of Dr Pixley ka Seme/West Street) from 12pm-10pm. No alcohol will be allowed inside the stadium. Masabalala Yengwa Avenue will be closed in both directions from 11am until after the game at about 6pm. Isaiah Ntshangase (Walter Gilbert) Road will also be closed for traffic from 3am. Motorists are warned to stay away from the area around the stadium if they do not have match tickets and are not on their way to the beachfront fan park.
