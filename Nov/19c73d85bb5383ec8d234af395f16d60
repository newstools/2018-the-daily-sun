MOTHER of two Esethu Adam (23) from Town Two in Khayelitsha, Cape Town was a victim of a devastating fire in Khayelitsha two weeks ago. She was pregnant at the time and took shelter in a church with the other fire victims. On 23 October, she gave birth to baby Ivakele in the church. “I lost all my baby’s clothes in the fire. It destroyed everything we had,” Esethu said in the story Daily Sun published on 26 October. She is very grateful to the People’s Paperfor running her story. Last week, Shoprite visited her in her new shack with a donation to help her and her kids. “I am so happy. I am surprised by all the baby stuff, because I didn’t expect a donation but since my story was published, many people have brought gifts. My new baby has brand-new clothes.” She doesn’t know the people who made the donations and said:“I want you to know you played a huge role by helping to take care of my baby. “You’d never say we had just lost everything we had.” Esethu received donations including blankets, nappies, toys, clothes, food and household items. Lunga Schoeman from Shoprite said they couldn’t just sit back and do nothing while Esethu needed help. The group has been helping people affected by the fire. “Our mobile soup kitchens have provided meals, with the Gift of The Givers, and donated goods to those affected by the recent fires, especially mothers with kids.” People who want to help can donate goods at the collection trolleys at Shoprite and Checkers stores or donate to the group’s #ActForChangeFund at till points.
