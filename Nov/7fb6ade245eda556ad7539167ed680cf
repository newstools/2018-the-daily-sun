TWO young pupils have become the latest drowning victims at Port St Johns’ notorious second beach. The grade 7 pupils from Marubeni Primary in Libode went on a school outing to celebrate their last year at primary school. Principal Cornas Nomkopo said the two pupils, a girl and a boy, both 13, were among of a group of 32 pupils on a farewell outing. He said the school did this every year. “What happened is unfortunate and devastating,” he said. He said the incident happened at about 11am. “The pupils were eager to swim. They went into the water with two teachers. But hardly 10 minutes later we were told that three kids had nearly drowned, and two more were missing,” said Cornas. He said they took the three to a nearby health centre while they waited until 5pm for divers from Mthatha. Eastern Cape Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said the department’s superintendent, Themba Kojana, and MEC Mlungisi Mvoko, had sent their condolences to the families of the dead. Police spokeswoman Captain Nozuko Handile, said the bodies hadn’t been recovered yet. “We’re busy searching.”
