THE Eastern Cape Department of Education, in partnership with other organisations, launched disability awareness workshops in Madzikane kaZulu Memorial Hospital hall in KwaBhaca on Tuesday. According to the department’s director of special programmes, Andile Mtikrakra, parents, children and teachers should declare their disabilities. “We want inclusive education for all. “If the department knows about your disability, measures to accommodate you will be taken. “We are still dealing with a problem of taking people and shipping them off to live in their own world and expect them to be normal in society. This workshop is advocating to change that. “We also want to highlight the relationship between gender-based violence and disability,” he said. Eastern Cape Disability Economic Empowerment Trust CEO Thabiso Phethuka, said inclusive education was the only way forward to end discrimination. “The journey begins with the level of education that is offered, then the work opportunities available to people with disabilities. We want to facilitate skills development and link it to employment.” Zininzi Mpurwana said: “There is nothing wrong with me. I am normal. “The only thing that is disabling is the environment and society.” She sensitised people on the appropriate wording for the disabled community: “We are not living with disabilities, but are people with disabilities. I am not wheelchair bound but it is an assistive device – it does not define me,” she said. The workshops will be held in different districts in the province.
