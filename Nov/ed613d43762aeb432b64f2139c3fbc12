ERIC Tinkler is happy with the way his plans are progressing at Chippa United FC. The Bafana Bafana legend replaced Dan Malesela three months ago when the Port Elizabeth side had collected just one point in their first three Absa Premiership matches. The former SuperSport United and Cape Town City FC head coach has been in charge of six league matches since, with the Chilli Boys collecting six points. United are currently 13th in the standings with eight points from nine league games. They were knocked out of the Telkom Knockout Last 16 after suffering a 1-0 defeat to Pirates. “I am happy with the way we’re performing,” said Tinkler. “I think there are games we could have won, especially our 1-0 defeat to Highlands Park.” The main worry for Tinkler is that Chippa are not getting results despite playing according to his plan. “We need to play good football and get results,” he said. “It means nothing to play good football without results.” Now, having faced Bucs in the Telkom Knockout and defending Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns in their last league match, Chippa’s next game is against the other PSL giants, Kaizer Chiefs, at FNB Stadium next Saturday (6pm). “It’s good to play big teams like Pirates, Chiefs and Sundowns,” he explained. “Players are motivated and work hard at training, as all of them want to play against these teams. But I will not make many changes, consistency is important.” United lost both the games against Pirates and Downs 1-0 and they will be aiming to upset at least one of the big teams in the top flight. United are not in action this weekend, as they are out of the TKO. They will have enough time to prepare for Amakhosi, who face SuperSport United at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Sunday.
