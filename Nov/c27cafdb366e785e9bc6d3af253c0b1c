VERSATILE Orlando Pirates defender Asavela “Shoes” Mbekile has his sights set on getting the nod to play in the eagerly awaited Soweto derby, round two, against rivals Kaizer Chiefs. The two giants will battle it out in a Telkom Knockout semifinal at Moses Mabhida Stadium next Saturday (3pm). Mbekile had waited patiently on the sidelines for his chance to play since joining Bucs from Mamelodi Sundowns before the start of the season. He finally made his debut in Bucs’ 3-1 win over AmaZulu in the TKO quarter-final and hasn’t looked back since, cementing his place in coach Milutin Sredojevic’s starting lineup. He also helped Pirates beat Polokwane City 2-1 in an Absa Premiership match and feature in the goalless draw against his former side Downs in Tshwane at the weekend. Said Mbekile: “It felt good to play after such a long time. Hopefully I will get more game-time. The derby is a big game watched by many people throughout the world. I want to play and will work hard to ensure I am in the team on the day.” The 32-year-old says patience was key as he waited three months to finally get his chance to play for his new club. “I trust the people I work with and waited patiently for my chance. I knew the process would take longer considering the team has quality players and any coach wants to win. When you are on the sidelines you often work more than those playing. I put in my best performance when I got the chance – I never doubted my ability.” Mbekile said it’s important to have a strong mindset when you are not playing. “Having a clear mindset is so important. I worked on my fitness and spent time with people who make me happy outside football. It kept me motivated.”
