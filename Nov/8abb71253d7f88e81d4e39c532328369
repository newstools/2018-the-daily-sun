THE Ndumakude Great Place in Flagstaff was a hive of activity on Monday when Thembu king Azenathi Da- lindyebo met with Mpondo king Zanozuku Sigcawu. The aim of the meeting was to discuss shared challenges which their kingdoms are facing and to strengthen their working relationship. Speaking to the community in a packed tent, Zanozuku called for respect among traditional leaders. “We should not undermine each other as traditional leaders. Let us work together for the betterment of our communities. Chiefs should also respect headmen. Government must help us identify false chiefs, because that is what divides traditional leaders,” he said. Zanozuku also asked the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders not to interfere with the decisions of family-led kingdoms. “There cannot be someone coming from one clan and telling another clan what to do. “We should follow protocol and respect the decisions of each family. We can discuss and talk about challenges facing our people, but making decisions is the responsibility of the kingdom,” he said. Azenathi called for unity among traditional leaders and for government not to divide kingdoms. “Government should give the kingdoms the space to make their own decisions and exercise their power as leaders. I came here to assure this kingdom that we can work together and share our knowledge for the betterment of our communities,” he said. Chief Zwelenqaba Mgudlwa welcomed the steps taken by the two kingdoms. “This is a great union for our kingdoms. We should always work together to advance the lives of our people.” Each of the two kings brought cows as a gift to his counterpart.
