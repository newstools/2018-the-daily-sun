THE Eastern Cape Liquor Board held an imbizo in Rode Village near Mount Ayliff. The imbizo was aimed at creating awareness about responsible drinking and alcohol trading. Spokesman Mgwebi Msiya said: “Even though this district consumes the least amount of booze in the province, our inspectors said residents abuse alcohol and liquor traders don’t adhere to regulations. “We’re also concerned about underage drinking. “Taverns might be complying with regulations but members of the public buy alcohol for minors.” Police spokesman Captain Zanemvula Mkula said some crimes were caused by alcohol abuse. “We get a lot of complaints about men who beat up women and children when they return from taverns,” said Mkula. Tavern owner Sebenzile Khumalo (45) said: “Everything I do is scrutinised, but those without licences get away with everything. “Our patrons don’t drink in peace because broke people sit here and expect others to share their booze with them.”
