CHAOS broke out as shots rang out in the crowded court. The shooting happened in the Durban Magistrates Court yesterday after a cop filing for divorce suddenly opened fire. The cop allegedly shot his ex-wife and her brother and then turned the gun on himself. His ex-wife and her brother died, while the cop was rushed to hospital. Apparently, after his wife’s lawyer refused to give his lawyer her new address, the suspect walked out of court and then returned to fire the shots. A witness said the man walked into court, pulled out his gun and fired five shots. “I ducked for cover. I didn’t know which direction he was shooting. “People were screaming and running out. The woman lying next to me was covered in blood. The two men were lying on the other side of the court.” The witness said the magistrate left the court. A man believed to be the ex-wife’s new boyfriend was outside the court during the shooting and then came into the room. Seeing the bodies, he started crying and injured his arm as he hit a glass door. Another witness said it seemed the cop heard his ex-wife would be in court with her new lover. “Perhaps he was angry that his ex-wife came with her new boyfriend,” the witness said. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a 32-year-old cop shot his wife (33) and her brother (26) in court before turning the gun on himself. The wife and her brother died and the cop was injured and rushed to hospital, where he is under police guard.
