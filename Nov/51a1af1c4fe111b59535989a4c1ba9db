HE BROKE up a fight between villagers, but now he’s the one in the firing line. Nzuzo Dlamini (20), from Nondweni Village in Nquthu, northern KZN, fears for his life. And it’s all because an angry villager lost a tooth! The man missing a tooth and his family allegedly sent threatening SMSes and made phone calls to Nzuzo’s family demanding that they either search for the tooth and return it, or give him R3 500 to buy a false or gold tooth. Nzuzo’s mum, Nonhlanhla Dlamini (44) said she feared for her son’s life. “My son finds himself in this mess because he broke up a fight. “One of the villagers attacked him and when Nzuzo fought back, the villager lost his tooth,” said Nonhlanhla. She said a few days later, the villager arrived at Nzuzo’s school and demanded his tooth. Nzuzo is in matric at Klwana Combined School. Nonhlanhla said when her son told the villager the matter was being handled by the elders of both families, he stabbed him. She said they were also receiving threatening SMSes and phone calls from the suspect and his family. She said Nzuzo’s madala had also received an SMS as “a final warning”. The Babanango Police Station commander said: “The matter was reported to us when a villager stabbed a pupil on school premises.”
