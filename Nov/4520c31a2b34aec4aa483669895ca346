CHURCHES have the responsibility to give politicians a moral compass. This is according to ANC national chairman Gwede Mantashe. He was speaking at the Assemblies of God Church in Stream Village in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Sunday. This was part of the party’s Thuma Mina campaign. “The church has a responsibility and authority to always guide politicians and give us a moral compass,” he said. “Politics is rough. If you are weak, you will not survive. “You must be strong. You must deal with all sorts of dirty tricks that come your way.” He said the church must have the authority to point out mistakes and say what politicians are doing is wrong. “The ANC is coming out of a very difficult period. Our movement was equated with everything wrong,” he said. He said they were getting out of that now. “If the churches do not pray for us, our work is going to be difficult,” said Mantashe. “Now we have Ramaphosa, who must take us forward, and if he does wrong things the church must come to him and say, ‘Ramaphosa, you are wrong’.”
