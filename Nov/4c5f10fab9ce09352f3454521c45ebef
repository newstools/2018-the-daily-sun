FORMER president Jacob Zuma was repeatedly advised to stop his toxic relationship with the Guptas. Former public service and administration minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi told the Commission of Inquiry Into State Capture yesterday that the ANC’s NEC became very worried about Zuma’s relationship with the family. Ramatlhodi told the commission at Parktown in Joburg that the Guptas disrespected Zuma and the country. Zuma told the NEC the people were his friends. “He said they helped give his children jobs when he was not welcome. “We were worried because they were humiliating him.” Ramatlhodi said the NEC was a paralysed structure, which could not take any decisions about Zuma. “Zuma was supported by a strong faction in the NEC, which backed him no matter what,” he said. “We were asking ourselves what hold the Guptas had on him.” Ramatlhodi said there was tension among officials soon after Zuma was elected for his second term. He said former minerals minister Mosebenzi Zwane and former finance minister Des van Rooyen even boasted about being Gupta ministers. Ramatlhodi said the landing of the Gupta jet at Waterkloof Airforce Base could not have happened without Zuma’s approval. He said a chief of protocol who was later blamed confirmed that Zuma approved the landing. Ramatlhodi also told the commission how the Guptas put pressure on him to meet them in Saxonwold, which he repeatedly turned down. He said Zuma’s son Duduzane tried to pressure him into meeting the Guptas. The minister said he spoke to Zuma twice about the Guptas and twice, Zuma just replied, “Kulungile, mfana kithi” (“It’s okay, my brother”).
