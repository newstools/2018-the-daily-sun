HE is widely known as the king of kwaito in the music circles, but Arthur Mafokate is also a doting dad, who away from the spotlight enjoys spending time with his girls. He shared an intimate rare video of what happens when he drives his two daughters Owami and Kelello, to school. In the Instagram video, the 56-year-old star is taking his daughters to write their last exams and documents their humorous anecdotes they share on their journey every morning. “Never mind my dirty mouth with milk on it and the bubblegum. Just decided to show you what normally happens in our car everyday as we never really give it away. But since it’s their last day of Exams together I felt it’s important to show the other side of Owami Mafokate and Kelello Mafokate, more especially the DJ. She was a mathematics genius before the music bug and that’s why her mum is sometimes mad at me for allowing her to do music. I had to act like I was about to shoot a photo so that they don’t think I am doing a video, otherwise they would have stopped talking #100DaysDaddyChallenge #TheMafokates to be deleted," he captioned the video.
