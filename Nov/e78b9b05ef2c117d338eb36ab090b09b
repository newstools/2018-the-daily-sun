MATRIC pupils who wrote Tswana paper one yesterday left their exam halls in a good mood, with most saying the paper was a walk in the park. - FREE STATE: Refliwe Khaile (17) from Sehunelo High School in Batho, Mangaung, said: “The comprehension question wasn’t that hard. I think I did exceptionally well because I love my mother tongue.” - NORTH WEST: The exam was also a breeze for pupils at Itumeleng Secondary School in Ledig, outside Rustenburg. The paper was made up of comprehension questions, summaries and an advertisement analysis. The pupils said Tswana was the home language of most of the people in the area. Keamogetse Maledu (21) said she managed to answer all the questions. Mmapula Maneedi (21) said the exam was one of the easiest she had written. She said the paper was easy to understand and didn’t have a lot of troubling questions. Remoneilwe Mali (20) said she expected to pass with distinction. “I wrote well and I expect to score 68 out of 70,” she said. No exams will be written today as it is Diwali, the Hindu celebration of light. The celebration symbolises the victory of good over evil.
