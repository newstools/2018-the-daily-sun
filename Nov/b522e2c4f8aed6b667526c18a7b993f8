MUM Anna Mahlangu (40) last saw her daughter alive on Saturday afternoon when they were together at her aunt’s place. The dutiful daughter, Hope (19), left to go to her grandfather’s place in Mandela Village to fetch something for her mum. The next time Anna saw her daughter was when she was identifying her body. Anna said she could not recognise her face. It was so swollen. But she was able to identify her by her clothes. The sad mum from Vezubuhle, near KwaMhlanga, said a herdboy discovered her daughter’s body at a dumpsite on Sunday. She said Hope’s body was found wrapped in a blanket and coiled with rope, and blood was coming out of her mouth. Anna said she wanted to know who killed her daughter, and why. She said her daughter’s body was found in Mahlabathini Village, near KwaMhlanga. “On Sunday at about 10am, her boyfriend called and said he wanted to talk to Hope. I told him she was not home. He told me he had waited for her since Saturday as they were supposed to meet,” said Anna. “The boyfriend told me he called her and confirmed that she was coming. He said after 30 minutes he called her again but she did not answer. He said he called three more times and there was no answer until her cellphone was switched off.” She said Hope was a good child who had taken care of everything at home. “Her boyfriend is the last person she was with on Saturday as they both went to the mall,” she said. Captain Nonhlanhla Kgosana said a case of murder was opened and the police were investigating.
