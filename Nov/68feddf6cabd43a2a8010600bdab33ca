Mzansi’s most vocal and politically-opinionated puppet, Chester Missing has scored himself a brand new show and to celebrate, he is throwing some shade. Almost News with Chester Missing will make its debut on eNCA at 19:30 on the 25th of November. According to the channel, “the show will take an irreverent look at the current affairs landscape and put high-profile politicians through their paces in interviews only the country’s most famous puppet can get away with”. Chester also told the media that he still can’t get over how ridiculous the whole thing is and even took the opportunity to throw some shade at former SABC COO, Hlaudi Motsoeneng. “I have my own TV show. I’m a puppet. Have any of you realised how crazy this is? Someone tell Hlaudi. He broke ground for puppets everywhere,” the puppet said. The man behind the puppet, Conrad Koch also said that he couldn’t be happier to be working with the biggest TV news source in SA. “South Africa has huge room for incisive, hilarious satire as we move towards elections next year. We want to make Almost News with Chester Missing both well researched and really, really funny,” said Conrad. Catch the weekly “24 minutes of 100% undiluted tjatjaragness” on Almost News with Chester Missing from Sunday, 25 November at 19:30 on eNCA (DSTV channel 403).
