THE anti-gang unit is squeezing the air out of the lungs of Cape Flats gangs! This is according to Police Minister Bheki Cele, who said since the unit was launched by President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this year, the number of murders on the Cape Flats had been reduced. He said at one point there were 63 murders a month, but in the past month there were 28. Cele said the leader of the 28 gang, Ralph Stanfield, and six gang leaders of the Fancy Boys were arrested and denied bail. He said since Operation Thunder began, 16 300 people have been charged in the province, of whom 14 000 were in Cape Town. “We’re taking the oxygen out of their lives,” said Cele. Western Cape Community Safety MEC Alan Winde said the minister had chosen to sideline the provincial government. “This clearly shows that this event is being used for political gain and nothing else,” said Winde.
