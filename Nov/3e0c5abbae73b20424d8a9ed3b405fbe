PEOPLE from Mandela North, Maseru and Magwaleni in Worcester are struggling. These kasis in Zwelethemba have been without water since last year. Magwaleni is a new area formed by people who fled gang violence in Irvin Park, while the other two have been around for longer. The residents said living without water is something they do not wish on anyone else. “We pray the municipality brings services to us so we can taste what freedom is like, because now we do not feel like this is the case,” they said. Ward councillor Moses Mangali said he had been reporting the issue to the municipality. “We are still waiting for it to help these areas with water, because they are really struggling,” Mangali said. Xhego Bhejule (42), who must walk for more than an hour from Maseru to Mandela North to reach a tap where he can get water, said: “We are struggling. We are forced to walk very long distances to get water and it is not easy to do this every day.” Limise Nakani (39) said they queue for hours before getting water, but the municipality is still quiet about the situation. “We recently protested about the poor service delivery from our municipality and we hope they will fix it soon.” Breede Valley municipal spokesman Johan Botha said Magwaleni was occupied illegally. The area was privately owned and there was a high court order forbidding any further occupation, he said. “There are no services in this area provided by the municipality. North Mandela and Maseru are municipal-owned areas and are not formalised. “The municipality provides chemical toilets and water standpipes,” Botha said. “Based on a detailed survey of both areas to determine the required services, the current resources may not be sufficient. “The final report will be completed before next Friday. “Additional resources will be allocated, based on need and available funding. Both areas are outside the urban edge and the municipality can provide only limited services.”
