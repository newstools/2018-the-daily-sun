Black Leopards are currently searching for a new coach after showing Joel Masutha the door. The Limpopo side announced on Monday that Masutha had “resigned from his position as head coach.” However, SunSport has learnt that Masutha was shown the door with immediate effect after they landed from their 3-1 loss to Cape Town City FC at the Cape Town Stadium on Sunday. This has left a lot of tongues wagging on social media with fans expressing their opinion on the matter. While a few welcomed the news, many questioned the club’s decision to let Masutha go. Meanwhile, the rumour mill has been in overdrive with regards to Masutha's replacement. Names of other coaches have been bandied about as possible options for Lidoda Duvha Leopards are currently 14th on the Absa Premiership log with only two wins from 11 matches thus far this campaign.
