ZANOKHANYO Children’s Home in Makhasa, Khayelitsha, lost everything last Wednesday. Manager Nolubabalo Ndita said a group of thugs who were stealing from the home’s backyard shack started the fire. When the story was published in the People’s Paper on Friday, the home received a call from Gift of the Givers. “We are thankful to the paper for letting the charity know about our misfortune. Now we are back on our feet. “When Daily Sun got here right after the fire, I didn’t realise we would get help so soon,” said Ndita. She said she was happy a suspect was arrested. “We caught a man on Thursday and he confessed to starting the fire. He said it was a mistake.” The suspect was moered by a group of residents before he was handed over to the police. The Foschini Group donated blankets to the home. Corporate Social Investment consultant Deidre Vrebe said the company couldn’t sit back while people from its employees’ kasi suffered. “Besides that, this was another way of giving back to the community,” she said. Gift of the Givers project manager Ali Sablay said: “It was our aim to help where we could because the home lost everything.” Police spokesman Captain Siyabulela Vukubi said a 25-year-old suspect was arrested on a charge of arson. “It’s alleged that the suspect broke in and stole some items before setting the shack alight,” said Vukubi.
