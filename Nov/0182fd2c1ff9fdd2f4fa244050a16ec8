Local rapper, Genesis Gabriella Tina Manney, better known by her stage name, Gigi LaMayne has been discharged and is back home. The 24-year-old rapper gave everyone a scare when she attempted to take her own life over the past weekend. This while the country is still mourning the tragic loss of Mostwako rapper, Jabulani ‘HHP’ Tsambo who allegedly took his own life after suffering from depression. GIGI AFTER SUICIDE ATTEMPT: IT WASN'T TIME!

She has since been discharged from hospital and is back home, expressing her gratitude to everyone who has been supporting her during this difficult time. “Thank you to every single one of my friends, industry mates and supporters. I’m sorry to you all. Clearly I’m alive to tell my best story yet. I love you for loving me at this time of weakness. You made me strong. Now I work on myself. Now I love myself,” she said.
