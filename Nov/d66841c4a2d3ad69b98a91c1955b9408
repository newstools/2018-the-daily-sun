WEDSON Nyirenda’s weekend would be complete if Baroka FC booted Bidvest Wits from the Telkom Knockout – the competition the Students won last year. Wits hold the TKO bragging rights, having beaten Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 in the final last year. Nyirenda is hoping to cause the biggest upset yet to pave their way to the final against the winner of the clash between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs. In fact, the former Zambia coach says he wants to win this Ziwa’Mo trophy for their club chairman Khurishi Mphahlele and the people of Limpopo. Baroka, who are in their third season in the top flight, host Gavin Hunt’s Wits in the second semifinal at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday (3:30pm). “We have been working hard to be where we are in this tournament,” he said. “It will be a huge thing for me to get to the final. I am crossing my fingers, praying and working hard with the boys. But we don’t just want to make the final, we want to win it. “It would be a huge achievement for me to win the first trophy in my first season as a coach in the PSL. “But first things first: We have to focus on the semifinal game and not get ahead of ourselves.” Nyirenda is treating this clash with the defending champions as the final before the real one. “Wits are a big team, like Mamelodi Sundowns, Orlando Pirates and Chiefs,” he explained. “We will give a 150% performance on Sunday. The good thing for me is that as a coach you don’t do much motivating, as playing a big team motivates players in itself.” Bakgaga will be without Onkabetse Makgantai, Mpho Kgaswane and Talent Chawapiwa due to fitness concerns and fatigue after their return from national duty for their countries. Makgantai and Kgaswane played for Botswana in their 2-1 defeat to Mauritania, who made history by qualifying for the African Cup of Nations for the first time, while Chawapiwa was part of Zimbabwe’s team that lost 1-0 to Liberia.
