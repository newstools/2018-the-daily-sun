Dear MizzB I am 28 years old. I drive an expensive car and I maintain a luxurious lifestyle. I have always wanted to be successful but my biggest problem is that I live above my means. When I get to parties I splurge on drinks and girls but at home I am unable to buy groceries that last the whole month. I want to stop this. I feel people in my life only love me for what I can offer them. Please help! - Brother Hey Brother The main person you have deceived with your lifestyle is yourself because you are not true to yourself. It is time to do some introspection to understand why you need to be affirmed by other people above yourself. This lifestyle will leave you broke and at worst, bankrupt. Remember that success is about being content and making the most of who you are and what you have.
