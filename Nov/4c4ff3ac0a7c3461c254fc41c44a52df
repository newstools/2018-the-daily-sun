SEXTING is sending someone sexy images to turn them on or
seduce them, but frexting means something different. It still involves sexy images – usually of yourself - but
they are ones sent to close friends, not lovers. They are a way of sharing the sensual, erotic side of
yourself in a playful way with your besties. If your best friend frexts you, don’t panic! You’re not
obliged to say how sexy they are or that you desire them. Nor do you have to respond with a frext of your own. At the very least, you should affirm them by sending
positive emojis as a response. One writer who enjoys frexting writes on bustle.com: “I've
sent my flatmate Snapchats of myself prancing around in nothing but a thong and
high heels, doing my best Nicki Minaj impression, and she's sent me ones of
herself sunbathing. “It goes way beyond her — a lot of my friends have seen
photos of me naked, or damn close to it.” Of course, it could make for awkward moments, especially
if your friend just thinks you’re being wildly inappropriate and weird. But it can also be liberating, say dedicated frexters.
For men, sending each other dic picks or images of naked torsos can be a way of
male bonding. For close girlfriends, it can also be a way to share an
intimate and yet usually hidden side of yourself – you as a sexual human being.
