BETHAL police in Mpumalanga are concerned about the increasing number of women being raped by traditional healers in the area. According to Constable Cynthia Mtsweni, they have received reports about women being raped by traditional healers. But the women are afraid to open cases because they fear being bewitched. These women visited healers apparently seeking muthi to help them keep their men to themselves. “The traditional healers allegedly insist on applying the muthi to the women’s genitals and then proceed to rape them. It is believed the muthi drugs the victim and the healers can take advantage of the situation,” said Mtsweni. She said no cases had been opened yet but the police were appealing to victims to come forward so the law could take its course. Mpumalanga Traditional Healers Organisation chairwoman gogo Phephisile Maseko said the victims must come forward so that the culprits could be dealt with. “We cannot work with healers who take advantage of women. They must be removed from the work we do.”
