COPS are turning up the heat against thugs and criminal activities in Westbury, Joburg. Police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the heavy police presence dealing with drug-related crimes in Westbury was successful. He said residents have gained confidence about reporting general crimes which affect them daily. According to Dlamini, over the weekend eight people were arrested for crimes relating to domestic violence, including assault, malicious damage to property and defeating the ends of justice. “Two suspects were arrested for murders committed in July and August. Another two were arrested for possession of drugs,” he said. On 24 July, Bradley Sauls was found dead behind a silver Toyota RunX with bullet wounds on his upper body. “At the time of the incident, the suspect was unknown. Police investigation and information from the public led to the arrest of the suspect who is due to appear in court this week. “The second suspect was arrested for Heather Peterson’s murder. She was killed on 27 September during a drug-related shoot-out. The suspect will join others who are already appearing in court for murder and attempted murder,” said Dlamini. He added that the JMPD successfully arrested 11 suspects for driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. “All the suspects were arrested over the weekend and will appear in the Sophiatown Magistrates Court soon. “Police appeal to members of the public to report all criminal activities. Any information may be anonymously reported to CrimeStop on 08600 10111. Information on serious and violent crimes may be rewarded,” said Dlamini.
