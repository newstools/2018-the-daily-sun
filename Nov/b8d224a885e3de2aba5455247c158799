Entries for the prestigious Liberty Radio Awards 2019 are officially open and the race to find the best talent on the airwaves commences. Liberty made the announcement this week while simultaneously opening the entries which will remain open until 25 January 2019. “By recognising those who create excellent radio content, we provide a measure for radio professionals to be evaluated against their peers. Through acknowledging excellence, we are securing the long-term sustainability of the industry as a credible source of information. The higher the quality of the content produced, the longer people will retain their relationship with a particular radio station,” said Liberty Radio Awards CEO, Lance Rothschild. The awards have also clarified that they will not be introducing any new categories for the 2019 ceremony but they have decided to separate Public Broadcasting Services (PBS) and commercial radio stations within each category. This means that in each category, winners will be announced for the four main broadcast pillars of radio: Campus, Community, Commercial and PBS, as well as some awards for online radio. There is no fee to enter the Liberty Radio Awards and all entries must be submitted through the online portal which can be accessed here. Awards will be bestowed upon the very best in the following categories: AFTERNOON DRIVE PRESENTERBREAKFAST SHOW PRESENTERSPORTS PRESENTERTRAFFIC PRESENTERNEWS BULLETIN READERFIELD NEWS REPORTERCONTENT PRODUCERBRIGHT STARHALL OF FAME NOMINATIONRADIO INNOVATION AWARDAFTERNOON DRIVE SHOWBREAKFAST SHOWBUSINESS AND FINANCE SHOWDAYTIME SHOWRADIO DOCUMENTARYDRAMA PROGRAMMEMUSIC SHOWNEWS AND ACTUALITY SHOWNIGHT-TIME SHOWSPORTS SHOWWEEKEND RADIO SHOWSTATION OF THE YEARCOMMUNITY PROJECTMULTI CHANNEL PROMOTION AWARDSTATION IMAGINGPROMOTIONS STUNT/EVENTBEST INTERNET-ONLY RADIO SHOWBEST PODCAST Entries for the 2019 awards must have been broadcast on FM, AM, or in the Internet-only category, online, between 01 January 2018 and 31 December 2018.
