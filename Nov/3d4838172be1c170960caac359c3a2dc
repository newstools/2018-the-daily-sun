SECURITY guards are meant to look after people’s property. But in this case, they stole from the place they were hired to guard. On Sunday, City Power security officers arrested seven suspects accused of stealing the power utility’s equipment. The officers spotted a suspicious looking Hyundai truck and attempted to stop it, but the driver sped off. The officers gave chase and the vehicle finally stopped in Braamfontein, Joburg. City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena said seven suspects were found in possession of 48 metres of copper cable, two flat TV screens and 136 circuit breakers. “The suspects said they stole the items from the Bank of Lisbon building which caught fire two months ago. One of the suspects is a security guard who worked at the building. Cops were called and the suspects were taken to Hillbrow Police Station,” he said. City Power CEO Lerato Setshedi said the company changed its security strategy. “This arrest proves that criminals are after our copper cables and equipment. But given our efforts to safeguard our tunnels, they have now turned to softer targets. The bravery of our security officers should be commended,” said Setshedi. Millions of rands’ worth of copper was recovered. To report cable theft and damage, call 011 490 7900/7911/7553.
