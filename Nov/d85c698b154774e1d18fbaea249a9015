A MUM from Asanda Village in Strand is angry with cops. Nolusindiso Plam (23) was left with a broken arm after she was hit by a truck last month. “My son and were coming back from the shop when he ran into the road. I threw myself on the road and a truck hit me, instead of my son,” she said. “The ambulance came and the cops allowed the truck driver to go. They said they took the driver’s details and as soon I was discharged from hospital, they would visit me at home,” she said. “I was discharged from hospital after a day with bruises and a broken arm. I waited for the cops, but they never came.” After three days Nolusindiso went to Lwandle Police Station. She said cops told her the investigating officer was not available. “When I went back again, the investigating officer was there, but the cops didn’t help me,” she said. “The officer told me it was my fault that the truck hit me. But I just want the case number and the accident report so I can claim from the Road Accident Fund.” Lwandle station commander Colonel Xolani Williams said: “Nolusindiso must come to the station and open a case. We’ll investigate the allegations about the conduct against the investigating officer.”
