THESE residents believe their municipality is not fixing potholes in their roads because the villagers belong to the ANC. The people of Hankey in Kouga, Eastern Cape, accused the DA municipality of neglecting them. Residents ended up fixing potholes themselves last week. They said the holes were so big they were causing accidents. Councillor Margareth Peters said she appealed to the community to develop her ward, which includes Weston, Rosedale and surrounding farms. “Service delivery is almost non-existent and this can only be because the DA municipal leadership doesn’t like ANC wards,” she said. “I have complained to officials via email, in council meeting and during standing committees.” Municipal spokeswoman Laura-Leigh Randall denied that certain wards were ignored. “Over the past two months, the municipality has been handling repairs internally. The September rains caused extensive damage. It was too much for municipal staff to repair in such a short space of time,” she said. “Hankey was on the list after Patensie and the repair team has already started repairs on Tshume Street.”
