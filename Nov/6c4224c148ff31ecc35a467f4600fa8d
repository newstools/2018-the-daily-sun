Mhala police in Mpumalanga have launched a manhunt for thugs who tried to kill a 53-year-old man with his own pistol. The victim wanted to wash his vehicle when he started quarrelling with a group of men at a car wash. He ended up being shot twice in the upper body after pulling out a gun. This happened on Monday night at Marry Pebble Stream Village outside Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge. One of the suspects is known as Clearance Dlamini from Kumana Village. The 28-year-old escaped from a police van in 2016, while being transported to court from prison in Mbombela. Now he is wanted for attempted murder. A witness told Daily Sun that the victim arrived to wash his car but the car wash had already closed. “A few minutes after chatting to a group of men he found fetching water, gunshots were heard and people ran for their lives. “We ran for cover because we didn’t know why there were shots. Then we saw a man bleeding and another one fleeing in a bakkie,” said the witness. Mhala police spokeswoman Sergeant Abigail Nxumalo said a case of attempted murder is being investigated. No arrests have been made. Villagers are urged not to approach the suspect as he is dangerous but instead call Constable Frank Masinga on 079 908 1338 or Lieutenant-Colonel Nomsa Mkhwanazi on 082 469 1250.
