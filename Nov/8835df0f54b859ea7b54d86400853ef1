TV host and musician Nandi Madida’s son Shaka is turning 2 years-old today and she could not be prouder. The star and her husband Zakes Bantwini, welcomed their bundle of joy exactly two years ago and their lives have been filled with joy ever since. To share with the world how proud she is of her son on his birthday, Nandi shared a cute picture of baby Shaka wchich she captioned: “Happy 2nd birthday my all King Shaka! Where do I even begin? Can’t believe you’re 2 years old already? “You light up the room wherever you are as you bring so much joy. Thank you for making mommy and daddy so happy every day! May God continue to protect and guide your beautiful jovial spirit. “Know your creator has such big beautiful plans for you in life. We love you so much!” Little Shaka is undoubtedly one of the luckiest babies in Mzansi, her mother revealed earlier this year that she had bought him a piece of land for his first birthday – we can’t wait to see what he gets for his second.
