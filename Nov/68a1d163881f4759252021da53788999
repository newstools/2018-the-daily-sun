MORE than 20 years ago, Herman Tlhabano (49) had a child with a woman he was seeing at the time. And today that decision haunts him. Herman from Boitekong near Rustenburg has been rotting beneath his toes since early this year. All the sangomas he has visited were clear that finding his child was the only medicine. Herman is pleading with SunReaders for any information about his ex so that he can see his child. Patricia Molefe left Herman when she was several months pregnant. The pair met in Kroondal, where Herman worked and Patricia lived. Before he started looking for his child he discussed the matter with his wife, who agreed that the child had to be found. Herman said many traditional healers told him they couldnâ€™t help him until he had found his child.
