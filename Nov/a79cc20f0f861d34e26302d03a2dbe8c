Orlando Pirates striker Lyle Foster says he cannot wait to work with “one of the best strikers” in the world in Monaco head coach Thierry Henry. The 18 year-old is set to join the Ligue 1 side in January on a long term deal after impressing the coaching staff during his time on trial. The youngster could not hold back his excitement about the opportunity to work with legendary striker Henry. The Frenchman remains Arsenal’s record goal scorer with 288 goals in all competitions, he also has 51 goals for Le Bleu in 123 caps. This is the kind of goal scoring knowledge that Foster hopes Henry will share with him at Monaco. “Anyone would be looking forward to working with him, he was a top striker and now he is a top coach so I just want to learn as much as I can from him,” he said. “But for now my head is still at Orlando Pirates, I don’t want to think about that a lot. “Obviously it’s a massive opportunity that i have to grab with both hands.” The star will have compatriots Keagan Dolly, Lebo Mothiba, Lebohang Phiri and Bongani Zungu to help him settle in France as they also ply their trade in the Ligue 1. “I went there to train with the team and I got to watch one game, Monaco and Lille. After the game Lebo Mothiba gave me his jersey so that was nice.” Before he departs, Foster is looking to make a proper impact in a Pirates jersey. He has found game time hard to come by so far this season, largely because of his school commitments as the club allowed him to focus on completing his matric. With that out of the way, the young marksman can finally focus on breaking into coach Milutin Sredojevic’s team, particularly with the CAF Champions League kicking off. “The guys are excited to go back into the Champions League, it’s a tournament that has great history with our club, we were the first South African club to win this competition so it’s going to be a big event and the club is ready for the challenge.”
