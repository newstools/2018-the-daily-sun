Cape Town mayor Dan Plato has announced that the City’s water restrictions will be lowered from Level 5 to Level 3. This means from Saturday every person will be allowed to use 105 litres of water a day, up from 70 litres. Plato said the City viewed next year as a recovery year after having successfully emerged from the severe drought. He said the City’s water users could also expect a considerable reduction in the cost of water in their municipal invoices from next month. So if residents use less than 6 000 litres a month they can expect to pay 35,5% less. “I want to thank all residents, officials and visitors to Cape Town who played their part in helping us get through one of the worst droughts this City has seen. “While the drought is not yet over, we have seen there is room to bring some relief to residents. “I know it has been tough and I hope this reduction in tariffs will bring some comfort over the festive season,” said the mayor. He urged residents to continue to use water wisely as a way to deal with rainfall uncertainty next year and in 2020. “We are no longer in a period of extreme scarcity, but it does not mean we should forgo some of the great water-wise ways which have become a part of our daily lives – and for which we have become world famous.” The decision to lower restrictions follows meetings between the national water and sanitation department and provincial water users and various stakeholders. Plato said the 40% restriction on water usage applicable to businesses had been removed. However, he encouraged businesses to continue to implement and investigate new ways to save water.
