NELSON Mandela University’s FishFORCE Academy will receive about R1 million to fight crime. The money will be used to train guards, supervisors and managers at South African ports. Crimes that take place at ports include illegal fishing, human trafficking, forced labour, fraud, forgery, money laundering and tax evasion. FishFORCE and the Norwegian ministry of foreign affairs signed an agreement on Monday. University spokeswoman Zandile Mbabela told the People’s Paper: “These crimes pose a massive challenge to police. “Criminals use the ports to transport drugs and firearms, as well as for human trafficking.” FishFORCE director Hennie van As said: “Port security officers are tasked with the control of goods entering and leaving harbours, and they are on duty 24 hours a day. “However, they’re not trained to differentiate between species and to identify fisheries products that aren’t supposed to leave the country. “The training of port security staff is a means to reduce fisheries crime by increasing officers’ ability to detect any criminal elements. “That is why we called the project StopGAP.”
