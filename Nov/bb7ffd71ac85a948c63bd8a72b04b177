MEMBERS of 10 poor families cried tears of joy on Wednesday. The Mtubatuba Municipality in northern KZN handed them keys to their new RDPs. Most of the households are headed by people who don’t have IDs, which made it hard for them to apply for the houses. Among the beneficiaries was gogo Nelisiwe Ncube (74). Nelisiwe has six grandchildren in her care. Her kids work in big cities while the rest died years ago. “Over the years neighbours have taken some of the kids in,” she told the People’s Paper. “I’m excited that I’ll now be able to live with all my kids under one roof.” Nelisiwe said she couldn’t believe she was now a homeowner, after living in a one-roomed shack for many years. “I don’t have an ID.” she told Daily Sun. “When people went to apply for government services such as RDPs, I threw in the towel, thinking there was no way I could own a house. “The municipality has made it possible. I wish that the government could give houses to other residents who’re in a similar situation.” Another beneficiary, Nomathemba Mfekayi (52), said: “I don’t know where to begin to thank the municipality for what it did for me. “When the builders came a few weeks ago, I thought it would take ages before I could move into my house.” Mayor Velangenkosi Gumede said: “We urge the beneficiaries to look after these houses so that those helping us with funds continue seeing the need to lend a helping hand.”
