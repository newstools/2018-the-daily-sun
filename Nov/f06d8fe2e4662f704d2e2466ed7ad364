Ayanda Boqwana from Ndlovini squatter camp in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, has been trying to get an ID since 2001. He told Daily Sun it broke his heart to see his younger siblings with IDs as he is 32 years old but has never had one. “I can’t take care of my family properly because of this problem.” Ayanda lives with his wife and three kids. He said he had applied for an ID in his home town of Mthatha in the Eastern Cape, without success. He said after he moved to Cape Town in 2016, he hoped things would finally work out for him. However, when he visited Home Affairs in Cape Town, officials told him his fingerprints matched someone else’s in Mthatha. “I’ve run out of options. When I went to apply for my ID again in May, I was told the fingerprint problem was resolved. Officials said I would get my ID soon but I still don’t have it.” Ayanda said he wanted to vote in next year’s election but he can’t. “It’s even difficult to get a job because an ID is life, and mine is meaningless without one. That’s why I phoned Daily Sun to help me so I can enjoy life like other people.” Nomthandazo Mati, Cape Town Home Affairs’ acting manager, told Daily Sun Ayanda was not registered at birth. “In 2012 he went to the Tsomo office in the Eastern Cape and applied for his birth to be registered and not for an ID. She said Ayanda received his birth certificate on 30 May 2016. According to Mati, Ayanda went to the Khayelitsha office to apply for an ID in September that year. She said it was found there was a problem with his ID number as it appears to have been duplicated. “The office is currently in contact with our head office to try and resolve the matter,” said Mati.
