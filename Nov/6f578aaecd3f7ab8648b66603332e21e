 PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will announce changes to the
national Executive on Thursday afternoon. He is set to make the changes following the passing away of
Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa and the resignation of Home
Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba. Molewa, who was minister of environmental affairs at the
time of her death, died of Legionnaires ’ disease, an extreme form of
pneumonia. Meanwhile Gigaba has been under fire in recent weeks after
the Supreme Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court upheld an earlier
finding that he lied to the High Court in the Fireblade saga. The Public Protector also recommended that Ramaphosa take
action against him in terms of the Executive Members’ Ethics Act.
