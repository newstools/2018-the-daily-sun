Stroop: Journey into the Rhino Horn War is an emotional
rollercoaster. The film by wildlife filmmakers Bonn√© de Bod and Susan Scott
takes viewers on a journey and puts them deep into the rhino horn war. The local Premiere for the film was held at the Nu Metro
Cinema in Hyde Park on Wednesday. Anyone who wants to know about the complexities of this war
needs to make time to see the film. The producers manage to take the audience, tell them about
the parties involved in this war, from the poachers, the people who hire the
poachers, the people fighting the poachers, the people fighting the people who
hire poachers. The film manages to tell the story of how at the
inequalities in South Africa and the beliefs in Asia are adding fuel to the
fire. But perhaps the magic of this movie and the reason it has
won many international awards like the Newcomer award at the Wildlife Film
Festival in Rotterdam, Best Documentary Award at the San Diego International
Film Festival is how it manages to do all of that but also connect you with the
animals. You leave the theatre wanting to do something; you leave
that room feeling a connection with the animals. You leave the room and you want to get involved because you
don't want more animals to face the brutality in the film. There are some tickets left for special screenings happening
in Menlyn Pretoria. The tickets for the screening in Cape Town have been sold
out.
