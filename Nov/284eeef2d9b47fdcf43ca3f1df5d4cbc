JOHANNA Matowa’s life has come to a standstill – she doesn’t have a birth certificate. This has prevented her from getting a birth certificate for her child and looking for a job. The 19-year-old from Newlands in Joburg said she went to the Orlando Home Affairs branch earlier this year to apply for the birth certificate. But she was apparently told the branch only dealt with children under the age of 15. She then went to the Joburg branch, but officials said she needed to apply in her home town. When she went to Hammanskraal, Tshwane, she was referred to the Joburg branch. “This is frustrating. I’ve wasted a lot of money looking for help. “I have a one-year-old daughter who also needs a birth certificate.” She said her mum had spent more than R2000 on transport for her to go to different Home Affairs branches. “We don’t have money to waste,” said Johanna. She said she couldn’t apply for a social grant. “I need to apply for a grant so I can buy a few things for my child, who will be going to creche soon,” she said. Johanna said she was looking for a job but couldn’t find one because she didn’t have an ID number. “I need to take care of myself, but I can’t do that because it’s as if I don’t exist in South Africa,” said Johanna. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said he had referred the matter to the provincial manager. “We’ll assist her,” said Mokgola. “The manager will assign an official to contact her.”
