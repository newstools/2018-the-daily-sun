south africa has many problems but no one can say its slow or dull. One of the more surprising bits of news to hit Mzansi was the court ruling that decriminalised dagga. In a short time, that ruling led to a rush of invention by entrepreneurs, and one of the most promising new products is Durban Poison dagga beer! Graeme Bird, co-owner and founder of Poison City Brewing, the business behind the cannabis lager, said: “A lot of people were sceptical of how our weed and beer flavours would mix. “Hops and cannabis are closely related plants and share many similar chemical qualities. This means that hemp is an interesting alternative ingredient in beer-making. “Most light beers sacrifice body and taste, which makes them watery, but the hemp oil in cannabis seeds allows us to deliver a beer that has a fuller flavour on the tongue while being light and refreshing.” To make the lager, the brewer said they used even the THC – the main psychoactive compound in cannabis. The THC made the lager an exceptionally easy drinking beer, lighter in alcohol while being fuller in taste. The adventurous brewers have decided to be the first to release a cannabis beer in Mzansi. They have already become a big trend worldwide trend. “We live in a world that is re-examining everything. “Our own lawmakers are changing their attitude on cannabis. All around the world there is new research and exploration about the many varieties of this once infamous plant. “With Durban Poison we wanted to be at the forefront of that change. “We want South Africans to rethink their drink.” ) Durban Poison has only limited availability at selected stores and venues nationwide.
