THEY tried to steal a car but got more than what they bargained for! On Saturday, residents at a gated complex in Waterloo, north of Durban, caught two would-be car thieves. A resident said the men were covered in blood, peed on themselves and almost passed out. “We believe they’re in a serious condition in hospital,” said the angry resident. Another resident said it was good that the suspects, who they believe are whoonga addicts, had finally been caught. “They got what they deserved. Because of them we feel unsafe in our homes.” Prem Balram from security company Reaction Unit South Africa said they were called to the scene by residents. “When we got to the housing complex, officers found a burning Toyota Tazz. “Two men were being beaten with knobkerries, stones and boulders by a crowd who accused them of trying to steal a vehicle.” He said a resident had seen a car enter the complex in the early hours of the morning. The car allegedly dropped off two suspects who were seen tampering with a resident’s car. “Hundreds of residents then blocked the exits,” he said. They stopped the getaway car, threw out the driver and began to assault the two suspects before they set the vehicle alight. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “A case of attempted murder and another of malicious damage to property were opened at Verulam cop shop.” He confirmed that two men were allegedly assaulted by residents and the Toyota Tazz they were travelling in torched.
