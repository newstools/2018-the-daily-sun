THERE is nothing wrong with cooking a pot of tasty phutu, but leaving it on the primus stove when you go to the shops is a bad idea! Sibusiso Zungu from Mkhanywa squatter camp in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni went to buy tomatoes for gravy on Friday but came back to find his shack burning. He did his best to stop the fire but soon it was out of control. And when residents came running with buckets of water, it was too strong. The flames spread to nine other shacks and destroyed them, along with everything inside. Angry neighbours who had bought clothes and groceries to take to their families for Christmas have lost everything. Gertrude Mahlangu, whose family lost two shacks built next to each other, said: “I’m ashamed of going to my kids with empty hands. “You can’t tell them the shacks burned and their new clothes were destroyed.” Zandile Zulu, who lost everything, said people should be taught about the dangers of fire. “People leave candles and primus stoves unattended and when one shack catches fire, all others follow. “We are relieved nobody died.” After residents rescued the victims and gave them a place to sleep, the affected families now are appealing to SunReaders to help with building material. Captain Pearl van Staad said ten shacks were destroyed.
