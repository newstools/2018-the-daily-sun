COPS in the Western Cape believe their fight against gangsterism is on the right track. This is after they arrested six suspects in Philippi on Tuesday for possession of three unlicensed firearms and drugs valued at R 1 129 950. “At around 15:30 the AGU members responded to a tipoff about drugs at a residence in Oasis squatter camp and conducted a search operation. “This operation led to the discovery of two 9mm pistols, a .45 calibre pistol, 70 rounds of ammunition, dagga valued at R 1 million and heroin with a street value of R129 950,” said cops spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut. Traut said that six cellular telephones and R11 550 cash, believed to be the proceeds of drug trafficking were also confiscated. The six suspects aged between 23 and 35 are due to make a court appearance on Wednesday to face charges of the possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition and dealing in drugs. The Provincial Commissioner of the Western Cape, Lt Gen KE Jula praised his members for the valuable contribution in beating the scourge of gang related crime in the province ahead of the festive season.
