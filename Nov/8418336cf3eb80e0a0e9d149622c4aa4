“WE see this as part of Ramaphosa’s war on black
professionals.” This was said by the EFF in reaction to news that
president Cyril Ramaphosa has fired SARS boss Tom Moyane. EFF said that Ramaphosa fired Moyane because of the
recommendations and the advice of the interim report by the Nugent Commission. "This is clearly unlawful and unconstitutional because the
Nugent Commission may itself be declared unlawful by the Constitutional Court
as it has been taken under review. Thus, Ramaphosa has no business pre-emptying
that court decision," said EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. The party said another absurdity is that by firing Moyane
through the Nugent Commission Ramaphosa has effectively killed his own
disciplinary hearing into alleged misconduct by Moyane. "This shows confusion and lack of character and leadership
and for the record we repeat that the EFF does not hold the view that Moyane is
innocent. We believe that Moyane is part of he problem that characterised the Zuma
era of kleptocracy. “However, we can’t allow Ramaphosa, Pravin Gordham, the
media and other agents of White Monopoly Capital to suspend the constitution
for the flimsy excuse of a state capture clean up. The rule of law must always
be respected, regardless of who is suspected of wrongdoing,” said Ndlozi. Ndlozi continued to say that “all those who are clapping
hands as the constitution is being eroded must be warned that by the time the
system come for you there may be nobody left to fight for you”.
