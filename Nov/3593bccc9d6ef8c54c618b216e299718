JOY was the order of the day for more than 100 young people at the Maritime Youth Development Programme send-off a few days ago. The 180 young people will work for the Mediterranean Shipping Company. The programme was launched as a joint initiative by the office of the premier and the South African Maritime Safety Authority. Lulama Mabhiza (27) from Nyanisweni Village in Mbizana said she was happy to be a part of the programme. She said she would be the first person in her family to ever board a cruise ship. “I will miss my two-year-old daughter, but work is work,” she said. Parent Andile Mdingi said it does not feel good to see your kids idling at home while you work hard to send them to university. “We are expecting you, our children, to make us proud.” Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle called on the young people to make the most of the opportunities given to them. He said the province needed its own cruise liner and a generation of dedicated young people. Masualle said the youth needed to be hands-on in the maritime industry. “These 180 youths are at the shore, but we want them to go further. “We are clueless about what happens at sea, so the youth must go there and come back with knowledge. “In that way, we can also participate in the industry. “But that requires a group of dedicated people.”
