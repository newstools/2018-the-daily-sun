WORK continues at KZN Co-operative Governance while those who witnessed a robbery at their offices receive counselling. Four armed suspects wearing balaclavas allegedly stormed the department’s offices in Mayville, Durban yesterday morning. After the four suspects entered the offices, they allegedly pointed a gun at the security guard, forced him into the guardroom, and went into the offices. It seems they turned everything upside down, stealing computers, laptops and TV screens. Before fleeing, they apparently also hijacked a 52-year-old worker at gunpoint and fled with her car. The vehicle was later recovered in Newlands. A worker said the offices have been closed and work is carrying on at other offices. “We can’t say how many offices were affected and the kind of information the stolen computers had, because cops are still investigating.” KZN Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said she was shocked at the incident, when many people’s lives were in danger. “This could have easily resulted in a loss of life. The bold nature of the incident was astounding and the harshest penalties need to be handed to the criminals,” she said. Dube-Ncube urged people with information that could lead to the arrest of suspects to come forward. “Those who have been affected by this incident are receiving counselling.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that four armed suspects confronted a security guard at his work. “They allegedly robbed a 52-year-old woman of a vehicle, IT equipment inside the offices and her valuables. They then sped off in the vehicle. A case of robbery has been opened at Mayville Police Station.”
