THE IFP’s planning to take the e-tolls matter to another level by tabling a motion to have them removed. Its plan will be debated by the City of Ekurhuleni Council today. If all fails, the party said it would call on society to occupy Gauteng highways, particulary those with e-tolls. The party’s Gauteng secretary and Ekurhuleni councillor, Alco Ngobese, said they would put pressure on government until it eventually did away with the “unfriendly expensive e-tolls”. “There’s no political will on the part of the ANC to do away with them, but the pressure we are going to exercise will show them we’re not playing. “We hope the mayor will be on our side as we saw the same ANC toyi-toying not so long ago in Pretoria,” he said. Ngobese said his party rejected e-tolls from the onset and warned they not only made a mockery of the poor but were also irrational and unfeasible. The motion calls on Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina to engage with the provincial and national departments of transport to terminate e-tolls and write off all debt owed by road users.
