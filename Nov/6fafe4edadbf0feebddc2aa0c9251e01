A reverend has told government to deduct tithes directly
from church member’s salaries and give it to the churches. The Ugandan Catholic Archbishop Cyprian Kizito Lwanga was addressing
congregants at St. Mary’s Cathedral. The Archbishop says non-payment of tithes affects
project development in churches. “Whenever we ask for tithe, everyone gives only what they
have at that time.” “But the Bible says a tenth of whatever you earn belongs to
the church. Give me your support as I front this proposal because it is good
for us. Aren’t you tired of putting money in the baskets all the
time?” Lwanga said. According to the Nigerianmonitor.com, Lwanga said he wants
Uganda to toe the line of Germany, where citizens who are registered as
Catholics or Jews have a church tax (Kirchensteuer) of 8 to 9% deducted from
their annual income. Lwanga said he was told Germans make agreements with their
government to deduct monthly tithe from their salaries and forward it to the
church. He says this money is used to build and renovate their
churches. “In Germany where I have recently been, if an employee is
supposed to be getting Shs1 million, the government deducts Shs100 000 and they
walk away with Shs900,000 and it is working very well,” he said.
