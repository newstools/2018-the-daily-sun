AKA’s third solo studio album, Touch My Blood recently went platinum and the rapper has been in a good mood ever since. He boasted about not having had to beef with anyone for his album to reach platinum status, unlike many rappers usually do. The Fela in Versace hit-maker also showed his appreciation to fans who support his music. “I just want to thank all the fans/fam who support me,” he said on social media, “In fact, who support this entire industry. “It’s because of you that we can feed our families. You are the reason this entire industry is thriving, because of your support. Thank You.” He said it was easy for artists to take their fans, to whom they owe all their success, for granted. “If tomorrow you stopped coming to the club, stopped coming to the shows, stopped buying the music. I’d have no way to provide for my family. Sometimes it’s easy to forget that you put me here and you can take it away,” he said.
