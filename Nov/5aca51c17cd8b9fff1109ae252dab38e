IT’S not easy to have a successful career in the entertainment industry. To make it to the top, one must understand how it works. This was repeated by various speakers at the Face and Voice of the Future workshop last Thursday. It was held at the Nozaza Community Hall in Ntuzuma, north of Durban. The youth of Inanda, Ntuzuma and KwaMashu braved the cold weather to attend the workshop. One of the speakers was Durban fashion designer Mamsi Phoko. Mamsi said it was important to look good at all times when in the public eye. Speaking to the Daily Sun, she said celebrities always had to present themselves in a respectable manner. “Finding the right designer who will dress you well is important. “One should know your own personal style and look. That way it will be easy to know how to dress,” she said. Sipho Mtolo (25) from Ntuzuma F said he learned a lot. “We were taught the importance of eating the right food and why we should exercise,” he said. Nombuso Mzobe (25) from Inanda said she wanted to become an event organiser but lacked funding. She told the People Paper she had learnt how to draw up a business plan and proposal. Workshop organiser Zaiboonissa Pheerbhay said they were glad people gained knowledge and appreciated what they did for them. “They interacted with the speakers very well and showed an interest in the topics. We hope they will take everything they learned and practise it in their lives. “A lot of successful artists and event organisers are created through such workshops,” she said.
