WHILE many workers are waiting for their Christmas bonuses, nurses at the Capital Haematology Hospital are fuming. Yesterday the nurses at the private hospital in Westridge, Durban, deserted their patients after not getting their bonuses. They protested outside the facility and held placards while they sang. They threatened to keep protesting until they got a 50% bonus and a 5,5% increase. One of the nurses (33) told Daily Sun: “We were supposed to get our bonuses this month but when we got paid we did not get them. “How does the hospital expect us to do Christmas shopping without bonuses?” She said they worked hard but were not appreciated. Another nurse said they received letters two weeks ago informing them they would not get a bonus this year. “We did not take that letter seriously as it did not have a letterhead and was not signed. “The letter did not say why we won’t get bonuses. “When we received our salaries this month we did not get the bonus. We are angry!” Hospital manager Vino Moodley said the matter was resolved and workers would return to work. When asked if they would give the nurses the money they were demanding, she said: “I won’t be commenting on that.”
