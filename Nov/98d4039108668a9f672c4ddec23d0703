A 21-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly stabbing his older brother (25) to death on Sunday. The incident took place at Tala Trust in Selosesha. According to witnesses, the accused got angry when his older brother asked his mum for money. Police spokesman Sergeant Martin Xuma said: “The suspect allegedly told his younger brother to stop asking their mum for money. “The two argued over the money issue and the younger brother allegedly lost it.” A witness said: “The two argued before the older one asked his mum for money to enjoy himself with his friends. “All hell broke loose when the mother gave the older man some money. “We never thought something like this would happen in our area. “The situation could have been solved without any bloodshed,” she said Xuma said: “The suspect has been arrested and a case of murder was opened. “The suspect is expected to appear in the Thaba Nchu Magistrates Court soon.”
