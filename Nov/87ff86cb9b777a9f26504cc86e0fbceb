HEATWAVES make drivers vulnerable to heat stress or heat stroke, which is not only a health risk but obviously impairs their ability to drive safely. Here are some tips for driving in the heat: - Avoid driving at peak times. Leave earlier or later to avoid gridlocked traffic. - Use the air conditioner because open windows cannot regulate the temperature. If you do not have an air conditioner, avoid driving between 11am and 3pm. - Drink lots of water. Signs of dehydration include dizziness, lack of energy and even fainting – which is very dangerous when driving. - Keep your car maintained. Make sure that your car has the correct levels of coolant. - Underinflated tyres cause more friction on the road and generate more heat which increases risk of a blowout. - If your engine overheats, pull over and call for help. - Park your car under cover or use a sun shade to cover the steering wheel. It’ll protect you from being scalded by the steering wheel and seat – cars can reach 50°C within an hour.
