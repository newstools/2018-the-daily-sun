KING Monada’s hit single Malwedhe is being played all over and driving fans crazy. From Nigeria to Malawi, from Botswana to the UK, people are posting #idibala challenge videos of themselves fainting to the song’s lyrics. The People’s Paper reported that South Africans were having fun posting videos of themselves fainting. Now the Khelobedu singer from Bolobedu, Limpopo is getting lots of gigs. He’s fully booked for the festive season and promoters are still begging him to squeeze them into his busy schedule. Monada’s manager, Makwela Makwela, said they’ve received lots of international calls. “The requests have been there. We’ve agreed but at the moment we’re just finalising logistics. “King Monada will perform in Nigeria, UK, Tanzania, Botswana and Malawi early next year. “We also did a radio interview with a radio station in the UK on Monday,” Makwela said.
