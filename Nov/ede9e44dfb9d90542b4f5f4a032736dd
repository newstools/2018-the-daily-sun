SPECIAL Investigating Unit advocate Andy Mothibi told MPs they are in the process of recovering R364 million from the SABC. The unit is investigating irregular expenditure and corrupt activities at the public broadcaster. Former SABC boss Hlaudi Motsoeneng was found to have benefitted after being awarded a success fee, salary increases and had R1,2 million in legal fees paid for by the SABC. The investigative unit has issued a summons demanding Motsoeneng pay back the public broadcaster over R21 million. James Aguma and a company called Lorna Vision are expected to pay back R62 million. Mothibi said the investigation has produced evidence to initiate civil action in the name of the unit and the SABC in five High Court matters. The unit was praised for its progress. MPs said they were happy that the team was producing results that would benefit the people. “It’s a breakthrough and I suppose it will be a major step in ensuring that these matters are resolved timeously,” said committee chairwoman Hlengiwe Mkhize. DA MP Phumzile van Damme asked about the timeline and when the SIU is expecting to conclude its investigation to ensure the money is returned to the SABC. Mothibi said that would be determined by how fast the cases can be heard in court. “We want to see the recovery as soon as possible and we won’t allow any legal technicalities to delay the process,” he said.
