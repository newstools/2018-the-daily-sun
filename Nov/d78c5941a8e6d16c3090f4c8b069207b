PATIENTS have been complaining for years about the service at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. And the latest controversy came when a nurse was recently caught napping on duty at the hospital in Soweto. There was an outcry this week after Facebook user Kefilwe Modika posted a photo she took on Monday of a sleeping nurse. She said she was unattended to for four hours. Kefilwe, who had taken her uncle to the hospital, said a security guard threatened her after she took the photo. “If she is working double shifts, she is getting paid to be there, and if she is not feeling well she needs to go to the sick bay,” she said. “Patients are not supposed to be inconvenienced because people are working double shifts. “Let us not condone bad behaviour.” Hospital spokesman Zenzo Ndabula said Kefilwe was not refused service. “We called her and requested that she send a written complaint. The written complaint has been acknowledged and the matter is being investigated,” he said. Ndabula said the nurse and security guard would face departmental disciplinary processes.
