POVERTY is a huge problem in Nkqonkqweni, Berlin, near King William’s Town. The kids suffer most because they often go to school hungry or only have rotten food to eat. But one resident decided to do something for the children in her community. Cingiwe Felejane said she was going home when she saw a group of kids playing on the street. “One of the kids was nearly run over by a car. Those kids were playing on the road because they had nowhere else to enjoy themselves,” she said. “In 2008 I decided to open a Nompumelelo Preschool, which looks after 54 kids “I approached Caring for Orphans in Rural Areas and asked them to support us. “I wrote a letter to founder Kathy Schultz and she gave a good response. She buys food and clothes for the kids and pays the teachers’ stipends.” Parent Nomvuyo Mfulathela (48) said life is hard. “We wake up early in the morning to look for food at the local dump. When get back home, we wash the maggots off the food we found. “But now I’m happy because our kids have a place to eat fresh food,” she said. Schultz said: “I was moved ed when I saw how the kids in this village were suffering. “I heard the kids who used to come to Nompumelelo are doing well at school. “That makes me happy because I want them to have a bright future.”
