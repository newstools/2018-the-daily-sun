Globally-recognized actor, Michael B. Jordan has officially premiered the much-anticipated movie, Creed II in South Africa. The hunk had fans screaming at the official premier, press conference and screening in Johannesburg over the weekend. He was accompanied by fellow actor and Creed co-star, Florian “Big Nasty” Munteanu who also had fans losing their mind. Creed II, written by Sylvester Stallone and Juel Taylor, is an American sports drama film that is the sequel to 2015 movie, Creed and the eighth installment in the Rocky film series. The film follows Adonis Creed, played by Michael, as he trains to defeat the son of Ivan Drago, the powerful athlete who killed his father in the ring more than 30 years prior. It is set for nationwide release in Mzansi on Friday, 30 November 2018. Definitely gained more respect for this gentleman.
