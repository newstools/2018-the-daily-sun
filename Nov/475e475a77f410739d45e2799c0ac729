DAVID Rangateng makes life easier for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. He works as a sign language interpreter at church and at his internet cafe. The 42-year-old from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun he was inspired to learn sign language when he realised a fellow church member could not understand the word of God. “At the time, I was a student at Access College in Doornfontein, Joburg, and they were offering sign language lessons,” he said. David, who is known ekasi as “Papa D”, said most police stations and clinics did not have sign language interpreters. “Deaf people get frustrated whenever they visit these places,” said David, who has been an interpreter for eight years. David runs an internet cafe from his house. He said he had 10 deaf regular customers and he helped them type CVs, make photocopies and use the internet. David said he chose to help people living with disabilities because he needed crutches to walk with. “I was born with post-polio syndrome, which affected my legs. I need to wear heavy shoes or my legs shake a lot,” he said. David said his parents were a pillar of strength. “They never hid me and they found a special school for me when I was seven,” he said. David studied human resources management and worked as a switchboard operator, administrator and HR practitioner for 13 years.
