STEVEN Jakane (36) from Botshabelo in Mangaung is a community builder. He started the Songezo Steven Jakane Foundation in 2015 after seeing the challenges faced by many kids in his area. Steven said most kids were part of gangs and it pained him to see them living such negative lives. He told Daily Sun the aim of his foundation was to help poor kids and refer them or intervene where necessary. He told Daily Sun: “My vision for next year is to adopt 50 pupils. “I want to help with their school needs, including school trips. “I visit schools during anti-crime events and talk to pupils about the risks of being members of gangs. “I also warn them about going to initiation schools at a young age, the disadvantages of not attending school and the disadvantages of tattoos. “I sometimes work with the provincial education department.” Steven was a finalist at the 2018 South African Men of the Year Awards. He was nominated in the category of community builder. The event took place in Joburg yesterday. The awards recognise those men who bring change in their communities and go the extra mile to make lives better.
