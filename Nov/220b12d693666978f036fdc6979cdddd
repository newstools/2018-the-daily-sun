A MOURNING family has decided to move their night vigil to a different place. This was after gunmen struck while the family were mourning at the service in KwaDabeka, Durban on Friday night and two family members were shot. Family member Ntombi Ntshiza (61) told Daily Sun that during the night vigil, they suddenly heard gun shots while the ceremony was taking place in the tent. Gunmen allegedly sprayed bullets at the tent and fled. Deon Ntshiza (25) died, while Xolani Ntshiza (27) was injured when they were shot on Friday. This was during a vigil for their uncle Themba Ntshiza (51), who was himself shot dead on Saturday, 27 October. Ntombi told Daily Sun her brother Themba was shot and killed in his house, allegedly by a man from the area. “The man threatened to kill Themba because they were fighting over a building site. The same man also shot two other people,” she said. “When he was trying to escape, he was caught and also shot to death.” She said the situation was very tense and they suspect the people who attacked them were probably taking revenge for the man who shot her brother. She said they buried Themba in the presence of cops. “Immediately after the funeral, we decided to leave the house and mourn Deon’s death somewhere else because we fear for our lives,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that the two men were shot by unknown suspects. “One died while the other was injured. Charges of murder and attempted murder were opened at KwaDabeka Police Station for investigation,” she said.
