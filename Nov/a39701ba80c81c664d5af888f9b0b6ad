A PROMISE made is, at last, a promise kept. Following scores of cash in transit robberies almost every week in Gauteng and other provinces, Police Minister Bheki Cele vowed to make arrests. And last Tuesday, Cele announced that 237 suspects had been arrested since April. Yesterday, cash management company SBV Services praised the minister for a job well done. The company said Cele and the police had made headway in the ongoing battle against heists. It said cops’ perseverance resulted in a 36% drop in such crimes compared to the same period last year. The company said it was pleased to see police prioritising these crimes and was working to keep vulnerable victims and innocent bystanders safe. “As always, SBV Services is committed to supporting the police and all stakeholders, including other private cash services companies, to help make the transport of money safer.” Its CEO, Mark Barrett, also commended their risk and compliance team. “We work tirelessly with the police to apprehend the criminals involved in these attacks. “No case is ever closed until the criminals involved are brought to book,” said Barrett. He also expressed his gratitude to their shareholding banks and board of directors.
