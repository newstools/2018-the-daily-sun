A 39-year-old suspect has been shot and killed by the
police during a car chase in Manganeng village, Ga-Sekhukhune. The deceased and his accomplices had just committed a
business robbery. COPS spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said a
security officer at the Clinic was allegedly accosted by two suspects and robbed
of her 9mm pistol with ten rounds of ammunition. He said the other suspect remained in the car. The
suspects, driving a grey Toyota Avanza, moved from the Clinic and proceeded to
a local Tuck-shop at Manganeng village and robbed the owners three cellphones
and an amount of cash. "The police were informed, responded quickly and
after noticing the vehicle matching the description given, a car chase ensued,"
said Mojalifa. The suspects abandoned the car and ran towards the
mountain on foot and in the process, started shooting towards the police who
responded by fatally injuring one of the suspects. He said a firearm with serial numbers filed off, was
found in the vicinity. The deceased is unknown at this stage. The three
cellphones that were allegedly robbed from the Tuckshop were also found inside
the abandoned vehicle. He said investigations are continuing to determine the
ownership of this vehicle. The remaining two suspects have since fled to the
mountains. Members of the K9 have been activated and are also assisting in
tracing these suspects.
