HE sits on a chair in his shack and wraps himself in a blanket just before he dozes off. And he fears no evil. He’s protected by seven dogs, which he says are his security guards. Madala Zongezile Mbombozela (61) from Mokgoba extension 37, near Daveyton in Ekurhuleni, has been sleeping in the open since his shack was demolished two weeks ago. He says Manqoba Sarila, a councillor, had told him the area was earmarked for a school. “Three other shacks were erected, but we were removed to make way for the school. I think it’s all about money. If you don’t have money, you get sidelined.” After being evicted he went to nearby Mgababa squatter camp in Putfontein to beg for a place to stay. But the same councillor apparently destroyed this shack as well. Daily Sun saw his demolished shack. The one next to his was not harmed. “I don’t have money. That’s why I’m being treated like this,” he says. At his previous place in Mokgoba, the SunTeam found three more shacks had been erected. They even had electricity. Sarila confirmed that Mbombozela’s shack was demolished. He accused him of invading land and advised him to come and see him at his office. Mbombozela has opened a case of malicious damage to property at Putfontein Police Station. Police spokesman Constable Justice Ramaube says cops are investigating.
