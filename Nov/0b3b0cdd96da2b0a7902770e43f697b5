ALTHOUGH she’s lost most of her memory, gogo Nyaniso Hlungwane is surrounded by a loving family. And on Saturday, her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren came to celebrate her 102nd birthday with her. Gogo Nyaniso was happy to be sitting comfortably and enjoying a delicious meal. She sat outside the family home in Soshanguve, Tshwane, surrounded by friends and relatives. Her daughter, Martha Shivambo (56), said gogo is loved by everyone. “She doesn’t recognise anyone. You need to speak into her ear for her to recognise you. Although she can still walk, she needs a bit of help here and there,” Martha said. “She never went to school and can’t read or write. But she’s the most hardworking person I know. I never went to bed hungry as a youngster,” she said. Gogo had buried five of her eight children. She has 35 grandchildren, 54 great-grandchildren and 80 great-great-grandchildren.
