LIMPOPO cops have arrested two women for allegedly
killing their partners. Cops in Thohoyandou arrested a 19-year old woman after
she allegedly stabbed to death her 25-year-old boyfriend during a drinking
spree at Mbilwi village outside Thohoyandou this weekend. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the
couple was with other patrons at one of the local liquor outlets when an
argument erupted between them. The suspect took out a sharp object and stabbed her
partner. The police and the medical emergency services were
summoned to the scene and swiftly responded. The man was taken to the local hospital where he was
certified dead on arrival. Ngoepe said the police immediately launched a manhunt
until the suspect was arrested after she handed herself to the police late on
Saturday. Meanwhile in the Lephalale area, the police have arrested
a 31-year-old woman for killing his 36-year-old former partner at Marapong
location Extension 4 outside Lephalale this weekend. Ngoepe said it is alleged that the deceased asked the
suspect to accompany him to his home, but the suspect declined. The deceased later went to the suspect's house and
allegedly found her with another man and a fracas ensued until the suspect
stabbed this man to death with a sharp object. Both suspects will appear before the Thohoyandou and
Lephalale Magistrate courts respectively on Monday on charges of murder. Ngoepe warn members of the community to refrain from
resorting to violence in case of any sort of dispute including the domestic
related ones which sometimes lead to the loss of lives.
