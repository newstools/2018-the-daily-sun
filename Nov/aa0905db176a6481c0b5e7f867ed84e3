THE young couple were just two weeks away from their
wedding date. And then the plane crash happened. According to news.com.au, medical doctor Rio Nanda
Pratama (26) was one of the 189 people killed when the ill-fated Lion Air plane
crashed into the Java Sea off Jakarta on 29 October, minutes after takeoff. He had been on his way home to Pangkal Pinang where his fiancé,
Intan Syari (26) was eagerly awaiting him. They had started dating 13 years ago when they met at
school.  Intan worked in the finance department of the same hospital. They were due to get married on 11 November. A few days before the tragedy, the couple had gone shopping
for their wedding outfits. In a heartbreaking Instagram post, Intan put up photos of
herself in her wedding dress on the day that should have seen their happy
marriage. She wrote: “There is sadness that I cannot describe, but
I have to smile for you. I shall not mourn. I have to stay strong like you
always told me,” she wrote. Intan told AP that Rio had joked about coming home late
and missing his own wedding shortly before his death. “We were just
joking at that time,” she said. “He asked me to still wear my wedding gown that he chose
for me on our wedding day, put on beautiful makeup and hold a white rose
bouquet, take good photos and send them to him.” Alongside another photo of her and Rio’s sister, she
wrote: “Although you are not beside me, your sister was with me to fulfil your
most beautiful last wish. I know you are happy up there …”, according to the
Strait Times. The causes for the Lion Air plane crash are still a
mystery.
