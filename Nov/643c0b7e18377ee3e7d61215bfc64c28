DURING Kessie Nair’s appearance in court last week, his lawyer Chris Gounden asked the magistrate to postpone the matter. Gounden said he wanted a chance to present new facts in Nair’s case after he was denied bail on 17 October. But yesterday, Gounden didn’t pitch and Nair’s case was again postponed, this time to next Thursday. Prosecutor Carlson Govender yesterday told the Verulam Magistrates Court that the state was still waiting for Nair’s medical and forensic reports as the investigation officer had not updated them. Nair was arrested in September after he called President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a Facebook video. He was charged with seven counts of crimen injuria and two of stirring public violence. Magistrate Ncumisa Gcolotela had previously ordered that Nair be sent to Fort Napier for mental observation. Before denying him bail two weeks ago, Gcolotela said: “Nair’s action isn’t only an offence to the president but to every peace-loving citizen who witnessed or experienced the painful past of this country.” She said Nair apparently didn’t understand the seriousness of his offence. Yesterday, magistrate Vera Alamchand postponed the matter to 8 November and said his new bail application, based on new facts, would be heard on 21 November. Nair remains in custody.
