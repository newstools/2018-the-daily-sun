TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila boss Masala Mulaudzi has landed himself in hot water following allegations that he assaulted the SA Football Players Union (Safpu) general secretary Tebogo Monyai. SunSport has reliably learnt that Mulaudzi, a well-known businessman, allegedly punched the former Moroka Swallows and University of Pretoria star at a nightclub in Cape Town on Friday. This was after his National First Division side drew 1-1 with Stellenbosch FC at Cape Town Stadium. Said the source: “Masala was fuming when he met Tebogo Monyai at Cubana nightclub. They had a heated argument as he accused Monyai of being a nuisance after his players allegedly went to the union for help due to unpaid salaries. The incident got out of control when Mulaudzi allegedly punched Monyai.” Safpu president Thulaganyo Gaoshubelwe confirmed that Monyai has opened a case of assault in Cape Town. “Yes, the incident happened and Monyai has opened a case of assault at Greenpoint police station. We cannot tolerate this and we will allow the law to take its course,” said Gaoshubelwe. He added: “This is bad. No one has the right to tell anyone how to do his or her job. This is not a banana republic.” Gaoshubelwe has threatened to report Mulaudzi to Fifa if these allegations were found to be true by a court of law. SunSport tried to call Mulaudzi and Monyai but their cellphones were switched off at the time of going to print.
