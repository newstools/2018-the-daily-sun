POLICE are offering a reward for information that could lead to cop killers’ arrest. Two officers were killed in separate incidents in Kamvelihle and North End in Port Elizabeth last year. Both were robbed of their service firearms. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said: “In August last year, Sergeant Linda Mzuku (43), who was stationed at Bethelsdorp, was found with several bullet wounds to the neck and body at his home in Wells Estate. He was off duty. “It’s alleged the suspect was seen fleeing the house and was picked up by a white car,” said Naidu. In December, two officers were shot while on duty. “Suspects fired on them while they were responding to an alarm at a business on Paterson Road in North End,” she said. “As they were waiting at the gate, they were attacked by unknown people and several shots were fired. “Constable Caroline Mjandana (38) suffered a fatal gunshot wound to her neck while 43-year-old Sergeant Anele France was shot on the right ear. “Both their service pistols were taken.” Naidu said the police were offering a reward because several attempts to gather information on the suspects were unsuccessful. “Police are calling on communities to stand together and expose these ruthless killers. “Police are there to serve and protect and should be able to do so without fear,” she said. Naidu said anyone with information about the suspects should contact Detective-Captain Tembinkosi Zanto on 071 225 7461 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
