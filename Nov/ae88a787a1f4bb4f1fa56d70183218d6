IT seems stores in the suburbs are just as bad at complying with safety standards as kasi outlets. On Wednesday, Nelson Mandela Bay environmental health inspectors conducted a food safety campaign at the Moffett on Main Lifestyle Centre and Walmer Park Shopping Centre in Port Elizabeth. The teams assessed food handling, storage, preparation and waste disposal. Officials were shocked when they found a cockroach and rat droppings in the butchery and bakery sections of one centre. They also found a pair of shoes under the butchery’s sink. The operation was led by environmental health services director Patrick Nodwele. He said: “This is a continuation of the campaign that started in June. “We wanted to make sure everyone who sells food complies with the health regulations. “We have been to different places across the metro and we are showing people and shop owners that food safety is important to the municipality. “When we visit shops, we look at various aspects of food safety. We also look at whether the premises meet our requirements.” The officials warned store owners to keep their stores clean.
