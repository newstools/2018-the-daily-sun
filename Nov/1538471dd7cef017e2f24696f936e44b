SOUTH Africa’s almost forgotten road runners Mapaseka “Speedster” Makhanya and Lebogang Luthuli, formerly known as Phalula, are planning to stage a big comeback next year. The two prominent runners have been out of the spotlight due to poor form, injuries and personal commitments. But they are itching to get back on the road and do what they know best. The pair left the Central Gauteng Athletics (CGA) awards ceremony empty handed last week and were quick to admit they had under performed. Makhanya’s partnership with running club Massmart ended on a sour note. After a much publicised public spat that involved a fight over her clearance, the club finally succumbed to the pressure and released her clearance. Makhanya is now free to join a running club of her choice. The last time she caught the eye in a competitive race was when she finished second at the Old Mutual Soweto marathon in 2017. But since then her performance has taken a nose­dive. Makhanya said: “I received my clearance and now I want to focus on regaining my form. I still have a lot to achieve on the road and I’m planning to come back strongly. “2019 is a new year, I want to start with a clean slate and get back where I belong: at the top.” Luthuli, who got married in December last year, said marriage had taken a lot of her time, but she’s determined to bounce back to her winning ways. She didn’t win a single race this year and only managed to secure 13th place overall at the Spar Ladies 10km women’s challenge Grand Prix series. Luthuli is also struggled with injuries and poor form. Luthuli said: “I’m not done yet. I still have to prove that I’m the best and for that to happen I have to get back on the road and perform at the highest level.” Luthuli and Mapaseka are targeting the Grand Prix Series and the IAAF World Championships in Doha, Qatar next year. Luthuli added: “I’m going to a training camp in Kenya next month to join some elite athletes there. I’m ready to take back what’s mine on the road.”
