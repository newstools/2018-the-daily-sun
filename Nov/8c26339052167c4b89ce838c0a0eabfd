POLICE in Mpumalanga need your help to bust Mihle Zingamo’s killer. The 14-year-old’s body was found on the street in Embalenhle, Secunda, her  hands and feet tied up. According to Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, Mihle had accompanied her eldest sister to the salon on Tuesday. She apparently left her sister at the salon and went home because she was hungry. She never got home. “Her father reported her missing at the local police station. “Cops launched an intensive search with the help of residents. “But her body was found the following day dumped on the street in Embalenhle extension.” Hlathi said it was not the first time this year that a child had been raped and killed in the area. He said 11-year-old Lerato Nkutha was sent to a nearby shop on 7 May, and her mum became worried when she took a long time to return. “She went out looking for her with no success,” said Hlathi. “She then reported her missing to the police. Cops searched for the little girl with no success. “On 9 May, cops were called to a house where a body of a child had been spotted.” The body was that of the missing Lerato. Anyone with information that could help cops bust killers in both incidents should contact Detective-Captain Sakhile Mlotshwa on 082 970 5774 or 08600 10111.”
