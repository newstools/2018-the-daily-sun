THE topic of depression and suicide is currently a hot one in Mzansi following the death of Iconic Motswako rapper HHP who struggled with the mental illness. The topic almost became hotter as fans on social media were convinced that another rapper tried to take their own life on Saturday. Gigi Lamayne, who also previously opened up about her own struggles with depression, caused a bit of concern on social media on Saturday with her “suicidal tweets.” The 24 year old tweeted her birth date and her date of death – which left a lot of her fans on Twitter worried about her well-being. “7 july 1994 – 3 November 2018,” her tweet read. A day earlier the Ice Cream hitmaker had posted “The end” on Twitter. It was then alleged that the star had been taken to hospital after trying to take her own life. Concerned fans left messages of encouragement for GIGI, whose real name is Genesis Gabriella Tina Manney.
