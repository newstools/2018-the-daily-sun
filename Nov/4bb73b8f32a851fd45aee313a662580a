RESIDENTS are in shock because of claims that zamas zamas have been having sex with underage girls. Daily Sun has learnt that young girls in Bekkersdal, Rand West City, drop off their books at home after school, put on short skirts and go to the nearest mine to sell their bodies. Frustrated parents said they had confronted the men who are mostly mine workers, security guards and zama zamas and told them to leave the kids alone. One frustrated parent said: “They tell us the kids are making lunch money for themselves and we must leave them alone. These are our children and why should we be told what to do? I fear my child will get HIV.” It is claimed girls as young as 13 go to the now closed Sibanye Cooke 3 shaft to sleep with men at the hostel. The SunTeam spoke to some of the girls, who said they needed money to buy nice things, which they could not get from their parents. A 16-year-old girl said she was selling her body to help her siblings. “My mother works, but she drinks all her money and we end up going hungry,” she said. Another 16-year-old said she used to visit the hostel, but her gogo told her to stop. The security guards who patrol the area said they had tried several times to stop the girls but they insulted them. A guard said: “It’s difficult to control the movement of people going into the hostel because the mine is now closed. Officials also tried to stop the girls, but they are hard to control.” Gauteng Department of Social Development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said they would send officials to investigate the claims.
