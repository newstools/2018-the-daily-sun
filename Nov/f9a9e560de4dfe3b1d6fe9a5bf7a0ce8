PARENTS of pupils at Gamula Secondary School in Bomvini Village, Ingwavuma, said their kids study in classrooms surrounded by tall grass. “We’re worried this grass might be hiding snakes,” said a parent. Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said the department did provide funds earlier this year. “We’re pleading with the school to use the funds it was given to ensure pupils study in a safe place,” he said.
