PROPHET Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng on Friday told the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg he was arrested illegally in 2011. He filed a lawsuit for an undisclosed amount of money only in 2014, however, saying his arrest harmed his reputation and caused him physical and emotional suffering. Mboro said he and his three bodyguards were bust at a shopping complex in Befordview, Ekurhuleni, for allegedly being in possession of unlawful firearms. He said only two of his guards had weapons and they were licensed. It is understood the incident happened after cops received a tip-off about a possible armed robbery. Mboro’s lawyer Advocate Gideon Raath said the cops accepted they were wrong and the trial was to reach a settlement agreement. Mboro said: “I was not in possession of a firearm. “I was pulled by my private parts, hit with fists, called a fake prophet, sworn at and thrown inside the van. People at the mall and motorists driving by were looking at us. It was very traumatic.” Mboro said he spent a night in a jail cell and was mocked by the police. “I was later released as they were at fault.” Mboro said the incident brought shame to him as he was a public figure. He said he suffered backaches and headaches as a result of the harassment. “People were talking about it. There were placards, posters and headlines about my arrest,” he said. The state said it was unusual Mboro waited three years to consult attorneys. They said he could not claim he did not know his rights at the time of the incident. They also said he could have seen a doctor if he was in pain following the incident.
