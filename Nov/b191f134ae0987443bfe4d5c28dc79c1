THEIR voices have finally been heard. This was what human rights lawyer Richard Spoor said yesterday when the North Gauteng High Court ruled in favour of anti-mining group Amadiba Crisis Committee. The group from Xolobeni, outside Lusikisiki, went to court to prevent Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe from issuing a licence to Australian company Transworld Energy and Mineral Resources. “Residents are the ones who suffer once mining operations begin. They have the right to say no,” said Spoor. “They aren’t saying no to development. They’re saying no to mining.” Residents have opposed mining in their area because they claim it will affect their crops. According to Judge Annali Basson, the fears of the community are not without merit. He said communities such as Umgungundlovu tend to suffer from mining activities as they are directly affected by pollution. The mineral resources department said it would study the judgment and respond in due course.
