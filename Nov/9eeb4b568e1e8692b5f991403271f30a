THE sight of a woman giving birth is one that most men do not wish to see. But for SunHero Paballo Lobone, it did not shake him one little bit. The jobless qualified paramedic was quick to jump into action when he saw a homeless woman giving birth on the side of the road. Paballo told Daily Sun the “midwife in him” kicked in when he saw the woman last week. The 22-year-old from Klerksdorp, North West forced his way through a crowd in the middle of Hillbrow, Joburg to offer assistance. “He is too young. Will he be able to do this? Please save the mother and the child!” were some of the things people in the crowd said as Paballo made his way towards the pregnant woman. He said at first the mum-to-be looked like she did not trust him, being a young man. “When we got there, the person in charge was an elderly woman. I asked if the baby had a cord” he said. Explaining the steps he took to ensure the baby was safely delivered, he said as he began working they did not have cord clamps and had to opt for cotton as an alternative. “I asked some of the bystanders to go buy a razor so that I could cut the cord when the baby was out. She pushed and the baby came out without any complications.” He handed the baby to its mum so that they could create a mother-child bond. Paballo said he then gave the baby to the elderly woman as he removed the placenta from the mother. “The mother of the baby thanked me and asked if she could name her bundle of joy after me. I was touched, because I was doing what I am trained to do.” Paballo left Klerksdorp for Joburg over a month ago to look for a job after volunteering at several ambulance service providers in his kasi, but he has had no luck so far.
