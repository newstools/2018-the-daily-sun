Not only is rapper, Sizwe ‘Reason’ Moeketsi a front runner in the boyfriend (soon to be husband, obviously) Olympics, but he is now proving himself to be a very loving father. The proud father-to-be cannot stop gushing over his baby mamma, TV and radio presenter, Luthando ‘LootLove’ Shosa. Reason and Loot are expecting twins who will be born in 2019 and will be their first children. The couple kept the pregnancy under wraps for the first three months but eventually had to break the news in October. Since then, they have shared adorable moments along their journey to parenthood on social media, leaving everyone green with envy over their young family. PICS: INSIDE LOOTLOVE’S FABULOUS BABY SHOWER This past weekend, Reason, together with Loot’s family and friends threw a baby shower for the radiant mother-to-be in Johannesburg. Shortly after the baby shower, Reason put out a heart-melting post in honour of the mother of his children and bae, LootLove. “To be able to carry the life of 2 is an unbelievable sign of Godliness no one can put into words. It is by far the most challenging yet gratifying experience I’ve had to go through with anyone, and Lord am I happy that it’s you,” the post begins. “There are many unspoken realities that come with the blessing of having twins, however, your strength is one that needs a shout out to God & the ancestors. I guess my point is... I don’t know how you do it. But you do. Therefore, I am and I will forever be grateful to you and your ability to give your body and mind into manifesting Gods blessings. God bless the king,” Reason said with a beautiful picture of the couple attached. LootLove chose to only respond to the post with emojis, but we can only imagine what her real response was like offline. Its taken me 2 days to describe the fascination i have towards whats happening inside you. To be able to carry the life of 2 is an unbelievable sign of Godliness no one can put into words. It is by far the most challenging yet gratifying experience ive had to go through with anyone, and lord am i happy that its you. There are many unspoken realities that come with the blessing of having twins, however, your strength is one that needs a shout out to God & the ancestors.
