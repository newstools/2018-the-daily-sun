WHEN the defenceless gogo heard her window break in the middle of the night, she shouted for help but no one came! The evil man went straight to the gogo in bed and raped her repeatedly. Speaking to Daily Sun from her home at Eluxolweni kasi in Hofmeyr, in the Karoo, she said the man raped her from midnight until morning on Sunday. “I was asleep and alone in my RDP when I heard someone break the window of my room. I shouted at the top of my voice for help, but no one came. “When the assailant, a tall man wearing black clothes, was inside the room, he came to where I was sleeping and started strangling me. “He raped me for the rest of the night without giving me a break. “My screams of agony and pain didn’t even alert my neighbours. “After he had finished he went out through the main door and vanished into thin air. “I managed to drag myself through the kitchen door and a passerby alerted people who called the police.” Gogo’s son (40) said: “When I heard about what had happened to her, I travelled from Schoombee to see her and take her to the hospital. I’m very angry.” Sicelo Ntoni, a resident, said: “The elderly have become targets of criminals. What kind of generation are we raising?” Captain Lariane Jonker said a rape case was being investigated by police. “No one has been arrested yet.”
