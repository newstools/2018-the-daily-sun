RELIGIOUS leaders joined hands yesterday to spiritually cleanse the N1 highway. They gathered at the Kranskop toll gate near Polokwane, Limpopo, to be led in prayer by pastors and bishops. The cleansing was done at the spot where 27 people lost their lives last month in a horrific accident involving multiple vehicles. The ZCC brass band also blessed the road with a few songs after the prayer session was done. Most of the victims of the horror crash were travelling in a minibus from Bochum in Limpopo to Tembisa in Gauteng. The accident shocked the entire province. It is believed the accident was caused by the front tyre of a truck bursting, leading to the driver losing control and hitting several vehicles. The deadly accident happened about two weeks after another crash that involved a bus a few kilometers from Polokwane. Ten people died and 34 were injured in that crash. The families of the people who lost their lives also attended yesterdayâ€™s prayer session. Officials have said if nothing is done to improve the N1 between Tshwane and Polokwane in the next 10 years, more people will die as the road is not able to carry the high volume of motorists that use it.
