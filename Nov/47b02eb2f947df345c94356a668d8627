Santiago Solari will become Real Madrid's permanent coach until the end of the season, according to papers filed with the Spanish football association, theÂ sports channel ESPN reported on Monday. The 42-year-old Argentine has led the team to four wins in four games since replacing Julen Lopetegui at the helm of the European champions two weeks ago. Spanish rules prevent an interim coach from staying in charge for longer than 15 days, which expire on Monday, without being appointed on a permanent basis. The Spanish Football Association (RFEF) told ESPN that Madrid had filed papers to hire Solari on that basis. With victories over Melilla in the Copa del Rey, Viktoria Plzen in the Champions League, and Real Valladolid and Celta Vigo in La Liga, Solari has enjoyed the best start of any manager in the club's history. Lopetegui was sacked after a run of form that saw Madrid sink to ninth in the table, but after Sunday's 4-2 win at Celta, the capital club are sixth, four points behind leaders Barcelona.
