A PUPIL has been suspended from class after allegedly seeing teachers kissing during school hours. The grade 5 pupil, from a school in Seshego in Polokwane, Limpopo was suspended after teachers at the school allegedly held a meeting at which his suspension was discussed. The boy’s uncle said the family was frustrated because the boy had been home since last Thursday. He told Daily Sun the teachers denied suspending his nephew. “The department of education called us and the school to MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe’s office and we were told a different story. The teachers were spinning the matter, accusing us of forcefully removing (the pupil) from the school, and they denied suspending him,” he said. “We are angry because they suspended him based on the allegation that he was spreading information about the teachers kissing. We were not there and for now we are treating the rumour as allegations. But kicking him out of school has angered us.” He said they were worried his nephew might not pass grade 5, even if he went back to school. “I doubt he will pass because I saw hatred on the faces of those teachers,” the uncle said. Limpopo education spokesman Sam Makondo said it was unfortunate that a pupil was suspended for such a reason. “The pupil is expected to return to school as there was a serious misunderstanding that led to the suspension. The circuit manager will be facilitating this whole process and ensure the pupil is back at school,” said Makondo.
