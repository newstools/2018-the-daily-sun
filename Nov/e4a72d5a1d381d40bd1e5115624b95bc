LIFE is already hard but it becomes worse when you don’t have an ID. Mzomuhle Ngema (27) from Folweni, south of Durban has been going to Home Affairs in Pinetown since last year. “Officials keep sending me back home to get documents. When I return with them, they send me back home again. “I don’t know what else I need to do.” He said they gave him duplicate documents and told him to wait but after time passed without any result, he went there again and officials made him start the application process all over again. “The most challenging part is they told me to obtain new documents from the first school I attended and the induna. “On top of that, they wanted me to come back with my mum, who is very old. “It’s very difficult to move her around.” He said his mum only got her ID in 2014 when she was 70 because of her fingerprints not being picked up by Home Affairs. But he doesn’t believe this is why his application is being delayed. “My mum successfully applied for my other four siblings’ IDs as soon as she got hers but when we tried getting mine last year after I was released from jail, I was never lucky.” Mzomuhle also doesn’t believe his spending time in jail from 2009 to last year could have complicated things. “I don’t think the Constitution says former jailbird can’t have IDs.” He said hardship drove him to become a thug after teachers told him when he passed grade 11 that not having an ID would get him kicked out of matric and he decided to quit school. KZN Home Affairs spokesman Cyril Mncwabe said: “There is no way he would have applied for an ID document without a birth certificate. He is obviously a late registration case for a birth certificate. The Pinetown office will call him as they are copied in this email.”
