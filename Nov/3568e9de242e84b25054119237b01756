A DAD and his son are in hot water after being bust for stock theft on Monday. They were found with sheep worth R87 500. Cops in Selosesha, Thaba Nchu received information about the theft. Police spokesman Sergeant Martin Xuma said: “A 55-year-old man and his son (31) were arrested and charged with possession of suspected stolen stock. The crime prevention unit members had received information about possible stock theft in Selosesha zone 5. “Members acted swiftly and went to a given address. “Police found a sheep carcass in the fridge and arrested the suspects. “As police were busy with an investigation, they received information about suspected stolen sheep at another house in the same area. “Police went to that house and found six stolen sheep. The suspect at the second house was the son of the man bust at the first house.” Xuma said later that night, cops received information about more sheep being kept in the veld near Tiger River. “When our members arrived at the scene, the suspects ran away. “Police managed to recover 29 suspected stolen sheep,” said Xuma. He said the rightful owner was traced and was happy to get his stolen sheep back. “The suspects are expected to appear in the Selosesha Magistrates Court soon on charges of possession of suspected stolen stock,” Xuma told Daily Sun.
