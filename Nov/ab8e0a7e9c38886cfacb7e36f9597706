LIZZETTE Williams has alleged that her sister is being mistreated at a frail care centre. The 52-year-old told Daily Sun that whenever she visits her sister, Sandra Freeman (48), at the centre in Mitchells’ Plain, Cape Town, she finds her tied to a chair. “She cannot move around freely. She spends the whole day tied up, meaning she sometimes soils herself,” she said. Lizzette said her sister has a condition that makes her shake and sometimes even fall over. “She was better when I was looking after her, but her condition has worsened since she was taken to the centre. They are not taking proper care of her. “I want my sister to be moved to another place, because my fear is that she might die if nothing is done.” Lizzette said her sister had developed bed sores on her buttocks because she was always tied to a chair and left in wet pants. She said Sandra was taken to the centre in July after spending time at another facility in Green Point. Lizzette said one nurse took care of 18 people at the centre, which was actually meant for people older than 60. Lizzette’s partner, Collen Bacela (48), said they visited Sandra twice a week and found her untied on only one occasion. “Last weekend we found her with a black eye and bruises on her forehead. We do not know what happened to her,” he said. Lizzette said they used to live in a Wendy house in Bonteheuwel, but it burned down earlier this year and they ended up in a shelter, making it impossible for her to take care of Sandra. Social Development MEC Albert Fritz’s spokeswoman, Cayla Murray, said they would investigate. “We presently fund 119 frail care facilities in Western Cape and work tirelessly to ensure minimum norms and standards are being monitored,” she said.
