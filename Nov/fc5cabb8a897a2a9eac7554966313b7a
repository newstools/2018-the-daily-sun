WHILE gospel fans worshipped and danced the night away on Saturday night, thieves were hard at work breaking and stealing from cars in the parking lot. Eliyah Papole (39) from Makgodu Village in Limpopo, a film director and producer, regrets going to the Thobela FM Gospel Festival at Cricket Club Stadium in Polokwane. He lost his laptop and a hard drive. Eliyah said he had unedited movies and wedding videos that he had recently shot and kept on the hard drive. He said he did not know how the thieves managed to open his friend’s Toyota Tazz because they did not break the door locks. He said he hid the equipment inside the spare wheel chamber in the boot, but the thugs searched and found his stuff. “I am so frustrated because the content on the hard drive belongs to my clients. I don’t know what to tell them. I thought I was the only victim, but I was shocked when I arrived at the Polokwane Police Station to find a queue of people who came to open cases of theft which happened at the festival,” he said. Eliyah lost a Lenovo laptop and I7 Lenovo hard drive. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a case of theft out of a motor vehicle had been opened. “Items stolen include a laptop, cash, bank cards, IDs and a computer hard drive. Suspects are unknown,” Ngoepe said.
