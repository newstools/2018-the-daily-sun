AFTER two years of searching with no luck, the Sanderson brothers from Olifantsfontein in Ekurhuleni are desperate to find their missing mother. Angel Sanderson (51) went missing on 20 January 2016 when she left for work and never came back. Now her family have turned to SunReaders for help. Her son Kevin said they could no longer cope without their mum. “My mum was always happy and smiling. “I don’t believe she’d leave us on purpose.” His mum woke up that morning and, as always, prepared to go to work at Olifantsfontein Library, where she was assistant librarian. When she didn’t come home, Kevin, his younger brother Joseph (17) and their dad Percy started searching for her. “We went to her workplace and asked her colleagues and they told us they last saw her when they knocked off that afternoon,” he said. “We searched everywhere. We even went to hospitals and local mortuaries but all our efforts were in vain.” He said his dad (67) was ill and needed someone to take care of him. “It’s hard for me because we’re running a family business and I’m taking care of everything. “We really need her to come back home. We need her support,” he said Kevin’s uncle Lesley told Daily Sun the two brothers and their sick dad were struggling without Angel. “We hope my sister is still alive. We need her to come back home. “Anyone with information should please contact the police,” said Lesley.
