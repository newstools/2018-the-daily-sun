THE cop who shot his ex-wife and her brother in the Durban Magistrates Court on Monday has died. Sergeant Phumlani Chiliza (32) worked for the protection and security services unit in KwaMashu, north of Durban. After killing his wife Deboseng (33) and her brother (26), Phumlani apparently turned the gun on himself. He was rushed to hospital but later died. Phumlani and Deboseng were due to appear in the divorce court. The matter had apparently been ongoing since Deboseng filed for divorce two years ago. Phumlani allegedly became angry when Deboseng’s lawyer refused to give him her new address as she had moved to Joburg. After being turned away by the lawyer in the morning, Phumlani left and returned during tea break, pulled out a gun, and fired shots. It’s believed he was angry because Deboseng arrived in court with her boyfriend. The SunTeam couldn’t get hold of the victims’ families. Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that Phumlani died in hospital. She said an inquest docket was opened.
