THE woman wearing a white shirt with long hair and sunglasses on top of her head is seen on CCTV cameras walking out the building with a heavy bag over her shoulder. Then she is seen walking at full speed and getting into a blue taxi. The woman allegedly stole an expensive SABC camera during state capture inquiry proceedings at the Tiso Black Star building in Parktown, Joburg. SABC staff members said she also took microphones, batteries, bank cards, identity documents and licences. Spokeswoman for the public broadcaster, Neo Momodu, said: “We have opened a case with the police, who are investigating the matter. The details are still sketchy. We will have an internal investigation to find out how the incident happened.” Captain Kay Makhubela said the police were investigating a case of theft after SABC camera equipment was reported stolen during the inquiry. “We do not know who the suspect is, but are following all leads.” Meanwhile, senior political reporter Mzwandile Mbeje tweeted: “The SABC’s camera equipment was stolen today at the commission while I was on a break.” Mbeje shared images that identified the middle-aged woman as the culprit. In a recent incident, a news crew in North West was attacked and robbed of their equipment by a group of people at a filling station. The crew, covering violent protests at Jouberton in Klerksdorp, North West, reported the matter to the cops.
