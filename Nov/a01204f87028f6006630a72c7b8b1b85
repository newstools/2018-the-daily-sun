THE term “extreme poverty” isn’t just something people in government talk about to gain votes. It’s a real experience for thousands of needy people in Mzansi. Welleminah Madiya (48) and her two sons, who are 14 and 17 years old, are living proof of this. The single, unemployed mum and her kids live in a one-room shack which could collapse at any moment. The family from Klipgat in North West have no form of income. Welleminah told Daily Sun her sons were her only hope for the future. “I feel like I’m living like an animal but there’s nothing much I can do about my situation. “It’s hard to get a job as a chronic patient because I’m always weak.” She said she had been living like this for years. “People from churches are our saviours as they give us food to eat at times and that helps us a lot,” she said. Welleminah said she hoped her kids could get an education and save her from the situation they are in. She said her dream was to live in a safe house. Resident Amos Matlang (34) said the family needed help. “They need a good shelter urgently as their shack could collapse any time. When it rains they sleep in the water.”
