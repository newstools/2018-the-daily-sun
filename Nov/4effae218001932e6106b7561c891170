LOCAL undertakers want government to help them save their businesses. On Tuesday they launched the provincial branch of the National Undertakers’ Association of South Africa in Mthatha. Provincial deputy chairman Lindeni Mxabano said: “Undertakers cannot grow their businesses because they do not have certificates of competency. “They cannot even offer services such as exhumation. “We want to be recognised as small businesses so government can support us.” Undertaker Nwabisa Mqungqutho said they struggle to get designation numbers from Home Affairs. These numbers allow undertakers to get a death certificate on behalf of a family. “Undertakers from other provinces have designation numbers. “We don’t, so we ask those who have them to help us. “We contribute to the economy of the country by employing people but our government does not recognise us. “We are asking the government to help us,” he said. OR Tambo environmental health practitioner Nomaitaly Mbini said funeral parlours needed to be certified. She said an undertaker’s funeral parlour must comply with the health department’s safety standards before it was certified. The building needs to have running water, chemicals and electricity and the fridges must be set to the right temperature. The building must also have a back-up power source that can be used in the event of load shedding.
