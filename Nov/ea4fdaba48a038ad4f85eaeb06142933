A MAN (47) suspected of killing two kids has been arrested. The siblings, a girl (9) and a boy (8), went missing on 14 September while playing outside their home in Tshepisong‚ Mogale City. Their bodies were later discovered in Slovoville, Soweto, by a passerby. They were buried in shallow graves with their hands tied up. Police said the mum’s ex-boyfriend was a suspect after he disappeared following the incident. Gauteng Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane praised the cops for the arrest. “The family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit in Krugersdorp made a breakthrough when they arrested a man believed to be the ex-boyfriend of the dead kids’ mum. “He was arrested in Mpumalanga on Thursday night. “The killings of women and children at the hands of people they love and trust are reaching an alarming rate and can’t continue unabated. “It’s important for people to make every effort to know the background of the people they bring into contact with their families at all times.” She hoped the arrest would help the family find closure.
