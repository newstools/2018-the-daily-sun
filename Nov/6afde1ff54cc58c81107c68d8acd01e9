MONICA Kgomontsho has been living in fear for months, but now her worries are over. The 46-year-old from Marry Me squatter camp in Soshanguve was terrorised by her neighbour’s dog for a long time. Her story was published in the People’s Paper on Friday. Now the SPCA has taken the dog away. Monica said the dog sat next to the squatter camp toilets and whenever it saw her, it chased her. She said last month it bit her on the thigh. Monica told Daily Sun she tried calling the SPCA, but never got help. Residents said the dog owner was arrested and has been in jail for some time. They said the dog acted as if it was guarding the owner’s shack. SPCA inspector Misheck Matlou said: “The neighbours said the dog was on its own. “But we’re taking it because it’s a danger to the community.” Matlou said residents should call the SPCA or go to their local police station if they were terrorised by dogs. Monica said she’s happy that the dog was taken away. “Now I can walk freely and in peace around the area.” Squatter Annah Ngobeni (65) said she used to feed the dog. “Many people had thought it was my dog because it loved me. “I’m going to miss this dog. But it’s good that it has been taken away so that people are safe.”
