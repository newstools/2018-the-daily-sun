Local actress Thuso Mbedu got a lovely send-off from friends and family as she tries to bag her first Emmy Award. The SAFTA award-winning actress has once again been nominated for her role in the second season of the Mzansi Magic drama, Is'thunzi. She will be going up against other actresses from Brazil, Germany and the UK in her bid to bring home the Best Actress award. The 27-year-old’s industry friends and family put together a lovely send-off lunch for her as she looks to make it second time lucky. Her co-star on Saints and Sinners Nthathi Moshesh and her best friend Makgotso M, were among those in attendance.
