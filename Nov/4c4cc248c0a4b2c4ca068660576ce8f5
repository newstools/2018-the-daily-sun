HE LOST his eyesight when he was seven years old. But Tshepo Nkadimeng didn’t feel ashamed of being blind. Instead he pursued a singing and acting career. Today, the 35-year-old from Monsterlus Village outside Jane Furse, Limpopo, is a well-known gospel star. He recorded a song called Lentsu La Gago with Joyous Celebration 22. He is also a voice actor, currently playing Saki on Mahlakung, a drama series on Thobela FM. His fans raved when he released his first album, Evangeli, in 2013. He will soon release his second album, titled Spiritual Injection. “Being blind has never been an excuse for me because I regard myself as able as a person who’s not blind. I have learned that when you live with a disability, you have to accept your condition first before you can expect others to love you,” he said. Tshepo said his life changed when he came to Seshego in 2009 and met Judith Sephuma and Paul Rapetsoa, who helped him pursue his career. “When I get a script for a radio drama, I get someone to read it for me. Then I practise so that when it’s time to record I don’t forget my lines.” Tshepo urged people living with disabilities never to feel sorry for themselves. He will be perform at the Thobela FM’s Gospel Festival at Polokwane Cricket Club on 17 November.
