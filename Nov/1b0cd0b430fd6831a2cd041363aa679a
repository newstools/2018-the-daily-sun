SHOCKED bystanders, traders and shoppers ran for their lives from flying bullets as thugs fired at a heavily armed police Quantum kombi approaching the scene. But when they realised the police were about to corner them, the thugs quickly jumped into their car and sped off. The cops gave chase. The gunmen ran away empty-handed after trying to rob an SBV cash van at a garage at the Thulamahashe Plaza, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga on Wednesday. “We saw gunmen running towards the SBV cash vehicle as the guards were getting back into the vehicle after collecting cash from shops,” said a witness. “But they were interrupted by a police kombi that spotted the drama and approached the scene. The gang started firing at the kombi before jumping into a silver Mazda 3, and speeding off.” The police chased them to on the road to Acornhoek but the thugs got away. Police spokesman Sergeant Gerald Sedibe confirmed there was an attempted robbery of a cash van at a shopping centre in Mpumalanga. He said cops responded quickly and the suspects fled in a silver sedan but didn’t steal any money. He said anyone with information about the suspects should contact Mhala police on 013 7730 331.
