THE Congress
of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the South African Municipal Workers’
Union (Samwu) have shut down the Vhembe District Municipality. They are demanding
that all implicated officials in the VBS explosive step down.   Chamano
said Cosatu fully supports the Integrity Commission about its recommendations. Sanco’s
Ben Mawela said the VBS looting saga saw almost R2bn looted by 53 individuals,
forcing the South African Reserve Bank to place the mutual bank under curatorship. Mawela
said Sanco has always argued that it was completely untenable and absurd for
those politicians and administrative officials to hold office.
