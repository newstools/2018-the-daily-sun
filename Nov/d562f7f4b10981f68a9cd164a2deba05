A video of a BMW i8 crashing into a wall has surfaced on social media. In the video, the black and white i8 can be seen slowly reversing on a driveway. As the driver slowly reverses, the car all of a sudden spirals out of control towards a wall and crashes. Towards the end of the video, a woman wearing a black dress comes out of the car and starts walking barefoot. It is not clear when and where the incident happened.
