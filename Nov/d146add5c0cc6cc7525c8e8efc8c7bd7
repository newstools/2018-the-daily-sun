WHEN Tseko Ramatsha was murdered at a tavern several weeks ago, his family went to a sangoma to get revenge. But now they’re at war with the sangoma over the bloody T-shirt they took to him to smear muthi on! Sangoma Moeketsi Sekantsi said he would only release the T-shirt once the family had paid him R1 500. But Tseko’s relatives said they had already paid R600 and the sangoma was trying to rip them off. Moeketsi said he wanted R750 for smearing special muthi on the T-shirt, and R750 for casting a spell on a knife so the killers would be stabbed. The sangoma said he had gone all the way to Rustenburg, North West, to get special muthi to make sure the people who killed Tseko (35) from Spooktown in Bekkersdal, Rand West City, paid for their crime. “I spent money on travel and they want to pay me peanuts,” he said. “They came with community members thinking they would get the T-shirt, but they wasted their time.” Tseko’s sister Puleng Leduma (30) said they were devastated by her brother’s death. “We just want his killers to pay for what they did,” she said. Puleng said Tseko was stabbed and left for dead. The family was informed the next day that he was lying in a pool of blood. “When I got to the scene, I found my brother lying on the ground,” he said. “He had been stabbed multiple times. “We want them to feel the same pain.” Constable Linkie Lefakane of the Bekkersdal police said a murder case was opened.
