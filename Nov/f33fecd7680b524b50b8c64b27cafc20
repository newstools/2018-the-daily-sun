TENSIONS were high yesterday as Metro cops and the SAPS raided shops. The operation in the Joburg CBD came after officers were attacked with stones by shopkeepers on Thursday when they tried to search for drugs and fong kong goods. One angry stall owner said he was not selling fake goods and that the police took all the stock he had bought with the last of his money. “I don’t sell brands so I do not understand why they are taking my stock away. I have children to feed back at home. Why are we treated like nobodies?” he asked. The cops also entered buildings and demanded that people inside produce documents proving they were in South Africa legally and had permission to trade. Those who did not have documents or had expired papers were arrested. Sihle Makhanya of the Umkhambathi Forum and United Brands told the SunTeam that selling counterfeit goods was a serious offence. “It finances child and human trafficking. As brand protectors, it is within our rights to do what we are doing today. Clothing brands that have investments in this country do not feel safe any more,” he said. Makhanya said they had been monitoring the sale of fake goods for over 20 years and were getting the support of the City of Joburg for the first time. Joburg Metro Police spokeswoman Tessa Adams said only people with no identity documents were arrested.
