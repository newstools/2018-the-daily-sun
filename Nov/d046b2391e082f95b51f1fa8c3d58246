COSATU deputy president Mike Shingange says the fourth industrial revolution threatens most jobs. He was speaking on Wednesday at the young workers seminar in Mbombela. It aimed to find solutions to ensure future jobs and look at the role of young workers on the shop floor. Shingange said most jobs will be replaced by machines, leaving people without work. “We need to define our roles correctly and make sure we don’t sleep on duty as it will cause huge retrenchments. “We want to encourage young workers to play their role because the next generation will be affected. “Preserve jobs. Young workers must fight privatisation at Eskom, closure of power stations, coal mines, retrenchments and high electricity rates,” Shingange said.
