THE City of Cape Town’s Law Enforcement Department has destroyed
16 926 bottles of alcohol. According to the City, the disposal of the alcohol is
symbolic of one of the biggest public safety headaches for the City. “In the previous financial year, our staff confiscated equating
to 11 515,62 litres of alcohol. Nearly half of the alcohol was confiscated on three priority
days over the 2017/18 Festive Season,” the city says. The City says most of the alcohol was confiscated on: Switching on of the lights event: 1 818 bottles Boxing Day: 2 126 bottles New Year’s Day: 3 805 bottles “The statistics prove that, for some, there is no fun to be
had without alcohol. The reality is that this blatant disregard for the law and
the impact of their drinking and antisocial behaviour forces us to dedicate
enforcement resources that could have been better utilised elsewhere,” the City
added. People who have had their alcohol taken are fined R500 and
provided with a receipt listing the exact items confiscated. Should they wish to reclaim their booze,  they pay the fine and they have to pay an impoundment
release fee of R624.
