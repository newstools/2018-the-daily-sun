EVERY year people are warned to be careful with their stokvel money, and every year people get robbed, some of them murdered, for their cash. On Monday three men were shot and killed while driving to the home of one of them to share out their R28 000 in stokvel money. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the incident happened along 4th Street in Mvuzane, Clermont in Durban. Gwala said the driver and his three passengers were driving in a Mazda Etude at about 2.45pm on Monday when their car was blocked by a red VW Polo. “The people in the Polo fired shots at the Mazda and pushed it off the road. “The victims sustained gunshot wounds. Three died at the scene, while the fourth one was taken to hospital,” said Gwala. She said the suspects took the cash that had been withdrawn by the victims, and fled. The police are looking for the suspects. “Charges of murder, attempted murder and robbery are being investigated by the KwaDabeka police,” she said. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “To avoid such incidents, we urge people to consider using other ways to handle their stokvel money.” Zwane said people should transfer the money directly into the bank accounts of stokvel members instead of withdrawing a lump sum. “Thugs are on the prowl. Carrying huge amounts of cash is an invitation to the robbers to steal the stokvel money,” said Zwane.
