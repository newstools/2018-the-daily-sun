GERMISTON police arrested two suspects aged 26 and 28 on Sunday for robbing a bread delivery truck in Marlands the previous day. Police spokesman Sergeant Styles Maome said the driver was about to knock off when a crew member asked him to give his cousin a lift. After the driver had given the two a lift, the cousin threatened him with a knife while he was driving. The cousin instructed him to drive to a local scrapyard, where he asked workers to open the safe in the delivery truck. The staff member and cousin instructed the driver to drive towards Marlands. A community member who saw the suspects thought they looked suspicious and called a private security company, which arrested the men and handed them over to police. The suspects appeared in the Germiston Magistrates Court, where they were denied bail. The first incident happened on Saturday in Primrose while the second took place in Sunnyridge the following day. Both suspects were detained at Primrose Police Station. “Police are appealing to the community to seek help instead of taking the law into their own hands,” said Maome.
