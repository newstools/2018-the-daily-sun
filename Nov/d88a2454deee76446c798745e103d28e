THOUSANDS of former president Jacob Zuma’s supporters are expected to gather outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court when he appears there today. Bishop Bheki Ngcobo told Daily Sunthey had organised buses for people to go and support Zuma. Ngcobo said churches, business forums and Andile Mngxitama’s Black First Land First still stood by their word, that they support Zuma. He confirmed that Mngxitama was travelling to the province to support Zuma. “Nothing has changed. We still believe he is being persecuted. “He is innocent until proved guilty,” said Ngcobo. He said the ANC was not involved in organising people to support Zuma. After Zuma’s last appearance in July, the ANC leadership in KZN said they were concerned that people like Mngxitama were using the case to campaign for their parties. Secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli toldDaily Sun last week they were waiting for the NEC’s response on whether they could take over the preparation of Zuma’s case or not. Zuma is facing 16 corruption charges including fraud, money laundering, bribery and racketeering.
