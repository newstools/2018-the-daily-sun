IT APPEARS the corruption charges against former president Jacob Zuma have not harmed his popularity at all. Zuma and ANC KZN chairman Sihle Zikalala campaigned on Friday and they were greeted with loud cheers wherever they went around the province. They met supporters at a taxi rank in Pinetown then went on to C Section KwaMashu, where he met gogos and madalas in the kasi. Speaking in KwaMashu, Zuma said the process of expropriating land without compensation should proceed without any blood being spilled. He said no one should refuse when their land is being expropriated. “There was no compensation when our land was taken from us so there should be no compensation when we take the land back.” Zuma then asked the residents to vote for the ANC next year. “We cannot vote for someone who never struggled. The ANC is our organisation. Next year we will win the elections,” he said. Zuma donated walking sticks and wheelchairs to the gogos and madalas. Gogo Ntombi Khumalo (69) said she loved the ANC because it took care of the elderly. “We get our pension every month without fail. If I vote for another party I do not think I will get that pension,” she said.
