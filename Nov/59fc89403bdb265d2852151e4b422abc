THE taxi industry is known as the playground of men. However, Zikhona Shologu is changing this. The 27-year-old from Nomzamo is the first and only woman taxi driver in Strand, Cape Town. “My older brother who died was a taxi driver. He bought his own taxi. I used to drive the taxi around while I was at school and I enjoyed it,” he said. After getting her driver’s licence in 2015, Zikhona was determined to join the taxi industry. She said at first, people doubted her. “There are drivers who say they won’t drive behind a female taxi driver but I shrug it off.” Zikhona said some of the men also tried to ask her out. “I have seen how women are done in by some taxi drivers. I would be a fool if I were to date here, knowing how these guys operate.” The mum of two said she loved driving and that she wanted to drive buses. She encouraged other women not to be scared of becoming drivers. Zikhona said it was not always easy though. “Your mind has to be sharp. Always be proactive and avoid being in the traffic officer’s book.” Fellow taxi driver Thembile Madonono (49) said: “You can’t tell it’s a taxi driven by a woman when she’s behind the wheel until you take a closer look inside.” Commuter Lubanzi Ngqoshela said at first he doubted Zikhona’s capability but she has provd to be a better driver than some men.
