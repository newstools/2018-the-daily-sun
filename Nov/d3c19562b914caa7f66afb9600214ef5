DJ Tira has given the year 2018 to Limpopo musician King Monada. He said that as the minister of entertainment in South Africa,  he gives the year 2018 to King Monada. This is after Monada released a hit song called Melwedhe. His latest hit Malwedhe even has fans “fainting”. The single, which means disease, has become the toast of the internet. The song talks about a person who gets a disease when his or her partner cheats, resulting in the person fainting. In one verse, King Monada sings: “If you cheat I faint. If you don’t come home I faint. If your phone is off I faint. “If I call and a nyatsi answers I faint, and if you don’t give me money I faint.” The hit has seen people around the country posting videos of themselves pretending to faint to the lyrics of the song. Some record videos of themselves playing the single and pretending to faint in their cars, while another video of people at a tavern also fainting while others cheer for them has gone viral DJ Tira tweeted: "Congratulations #KingMonada as the Minister of Entertainment in South Africa I give you 2018!
