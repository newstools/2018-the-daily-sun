If diabetes
is left unchecked, it will continue to kill and harm hundreds of thousands each
year. These were
the words of Joburg’s MMC for Health and Social Development Dr Mpho Phalatse. Phalatse
was speaking in Soweto on World Diabetes’ Day, which took place on Wednesday. According
to statistics released in 2017 on mortality data by Statistics SA, diabetes is
the second leading cause of death in Mzansi. There are
approximately 1.5 million people living with diabetes in South Africa but may
not be aware. The stats
also revealed that 65% of people will die from some form of heart disease or stroke. It was also
revealed that 5 out of a hundred adults in the country had diabetes in 2017. Every 30
seconds, someone loses a limb from diabetes. Dr Phalatse
also said that the cause of type I diabetes, also known as childhood onset
diabetes, is unknown. She also
remarked that type II diabetes is 90% preventable. Yet in
spite of this, she said, the country is seeing a rapid rise in the prevalence
of type II diabetes. “More work is
needed to fight diabetes, which is proving to be a silent killer,” Phalatse
said.
