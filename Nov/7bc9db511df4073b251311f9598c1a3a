THE massive sinkhole in Jean Avenue, Centurion which has inconvenienced businesses and people living and working in Tshwane has been fixed! Mayor Solly Msimanga on Tuesday visited the areas affected by sinkholes recently. “I visited the Laudium sinkhole to provide an update on the progress made with regards to repair it,” he said. “I also visited the sinkhole in Jean-Avenue, Centurion, and assisted the road-marking contractor with the road markings so that the road could be officially opened on Wednesday. “This sinkhole, which has caused massive disruption to the business and traffic flow in Centurion, has finally been restored.” He said the repairers were hard at work at the 2nd Avenue site in Claudius. “Due to the massive size of the sinkhole, excavation and repair work is being done in phases,” said Msimanga. The repair work timeframe was on target and, provided there were no unforeseen delays, the road would be opening at the end of February next year.
