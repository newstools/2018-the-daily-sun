MZANSI’S irregular spending has increased to R51 billion. This was what Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu told parliament when he delivered the 2017/18 audit report yesterday. He said the figure did not include spending at Transnet and Eskom, which spent R28,4 billion not in line with laws governing public finances. On top of this, Makwetu said, fruitless and wasteful spending had doubled in comparison with the previous financial year and was sitting at R2.5 billion. He said Western Cape and Gauteng received clean audits while Free State and North West were the worst in terms of accounting for public money. “These provinces were in a very bad state. Their financial health was the worst of all the provinces. Delays in the completion of projects, poor quality work and payments without evidence of delivery, especially in Free State, resulted in poor service delivery and allegations of fraud,” said Makwetu. He said the audit outcomes in Eastern Cape had gone backwards as a result of the slow pace in addressing the findings raised by his office every year. Mpumalanga was the only province where the audit outcomes improved. Makwetu said outcomes in Northern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal had not been reliable over the past four years, as they would improve one year and then worsen again the following year. He said there was a lack of urgency in these provinces in responding to the root causes of the problem.
