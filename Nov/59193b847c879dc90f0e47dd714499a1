CATO Manor residents in Durban have urged the municipality to use all vacant land to prevent land invasions. The residents said this during a prayer service at Wiggins High School on Wednesday night. The prayers came after the school was burned down last week, allegedly by people who are demanding to build their shacks on land that belongs to the school. It was the second time the school has been attacked. CPF chairman Mandla Xulu said: “Cato Manor is closer to town so people from rural areas and townships are targeting the area because they want to be closer to town. We urge the municipality to find something to do with all the vacant land around the city to prevent illegal invasion by squatters.” He also asked all the schools in the area to consider donating their used land to co-operatives for gardening because if the school land is unused, squatters will always target it. Xulu said Wiggins School had lots of unused land and had been invaded several times. Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said land invasion is a crime and police must deal with the invaders. He said schools were allocated big spaces for future purposes because the school may see a need to build classrooms or sports fields. eThekwini Human Settlement head Mondli Mthembu said they had already intervened in Cato Manor issues. He said he held a meeting with the residents on Wednesday and formed a committee to deal with land invasion.
