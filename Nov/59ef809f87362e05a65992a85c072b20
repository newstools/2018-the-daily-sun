R&B DIVA Toni Braxton is engaged to be married to hip hop megastar Birdman, but she doesn’t have her ring, because she forgot her handbag on a plane and even though she later recovered the bag – it was without her engagement ring and some of her other jewelry. So, in a desperate plea, the star took to her Instagram to ask whoever “borrowed” it to please bring it back. “Hey everyone @Delta located my LV train case. Unfortunately most of my jewellery items are missing, including my engagement ring. Whoever borrowed it, please return it. I promise no questions asked,” the star pleaded.  Feeling back to my old self again, yay! But I’m sad today ?? my engagement ring is missing ?? but I’m optimistic that someone will find Bonnie and return her home!
