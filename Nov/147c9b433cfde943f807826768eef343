RESIDENTS took to the streets yesterday to show their anger over the bad service they receive at their local hospital. The people of Matibidi in Mpumalanga said the situation was putting their lives at risk. Resident Peter Makhubela claimed when one drops a relative off at Matibidi Hospital, the chances of them returning home are slim. “Everything is out of order. They employ you according to your political affiliation. The board members are also appointed according to which party they belong to. We don’t want this and we want them to disband the board,” he said. Peter said there were rumours that the health department wanted to downgrade the hospital to a clinic. “This is the closest hospital to us and if they do this, we’ll be forced to travel to Sabie, which will be expensive. “We have had several meetings with them to discuss some of the issues we have but no concrete solutions have come of them.” Lefa Molapo, whose niece died at the hospital, said he didn’t have any faith in the staff. “We lose our loved ones, the service is bad and we have to travel as far as Sabie to get proper treatment,” he said. Their memorandum of grievances was received by acting hospital CEO Khinias Mashego, who promised to hand it over to the right people.
