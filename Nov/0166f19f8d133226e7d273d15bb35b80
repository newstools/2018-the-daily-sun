LWANDLE Police Station in Strand, Cape Town is facing a vehicle shortage. The cop shop has had to borrow vehicles from Harare Police Station. According to deputy provincial police commissioner Major-General Mpumelelo Manci, the Lwandle cop shop has 12 vehicles and many of them have thousands of kilometres on the clock. Community leaders raised the issue with portfolio committee on police chairman Francois Beukman. He and Manci said the matter needed urgent attention. Beukman said: “The deputy provincial police commissioner is going to look into the problem and ensure it is solved. “The portfolio committee wants to assure citizens there is a large number of vehicles available for visible policing. “If a resident of Lwandle or Nomzamo calls and there is no vehicle available, it affects the trust between the community and police.” Beukman said the portfolio committee was expecting a report from Manci on measures that will be put in place to ensure there are enough vehicles to serve the community. Lwandle police spokesman Sergeant Mothokozisi Gama admitted that the station has been using Harare cop shop’s vehicles. “The station borrowed two vans, as ours were sent for servicing and repairs.” Gama would not disclose how many cars the station has at the moment. “We recently got back some of our vehicles and we will continue to provide service to the community.”
