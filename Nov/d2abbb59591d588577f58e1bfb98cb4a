One mentally ill patient has died, and 200 other patients
are in danger. This is because 90 workers at the San Michele Home for
the mentally disabled in Brakpan are protesting over a wage dispute. According to the DA San Michele Home for the mentally
challenged is a registered NPO, which has been in existence since 1945, relying
mainly on government funding and donations from the public. Many of the
patients in its care, who are between 18 and 84, have no family and no means of
support other than that provided by the home. The DA alleged that it had also been brought to their
attention that residents at the home are not receiving any adult diapers or dry
food from the Department of Health, making the daily provision to residents
difficult. â€œLast year, San Michele approached the North Gauteng High
Court to force the Gauteng Department of Health to pay more than R2-million
owed to it in subsidies. Although the court ordered the department to pay up,
which they subsequently did, the home finds itself in the same predicament,
wrote a statement sent by the DA. The statement explained that the home is paid R4 100 per
month per patient to cover food, salaries for staff members, medical treatment,
toiletries, clothing and bedding. The DA calls for the portfolio committee of health to
speedily intervene in the current wage dispute at the home and ensure the home is paid all outstanding
subsidies to keep its doors open.
