WHEN they saw bricks being offloaded from a truck near their home last week, they thought their nightmare of living in a house that is continually flooded was over. But they were soon disappointed when they found out that the bricks were to build toilets instead. The couple from L section in KwaMashu, north of Durban said their four-roomed house was on a verge of collapse due to water that seeps up from underneath. Lindiwe Ngobese (44) said they reported the matter to the councillor and asked for the house to be demolished and rebuilt. “The water only affects our house. I’ve reported this to the councillor several times but he hasn’t done anything,” she said. She said the walls were cracking from inside and outside. “We had the walls plastered in 2016 because of the cracks but I can’t do anything about the cracked floors. This has cost me so much money because all my furniture was damaged by the water,” she said. She said they didn’t use the back door any more because of the water. “My husband and I took our children to my family home because we couldn’t live with them here,” she said. Lindiwe said she didn’t understand why the councillor included them in the toilet project. “We are desperate for a house, not a toilet. I want them to demolish this house and see where the water is coming from. “Then they will need to rebuild it properly,” she said. Councillor Muziwenhlanhla Shezi said the problem was caused by old pipes. “Those old pipes will be replaced with new ones when the toilets are being built,” he said.
