THE investigating officer in the murder case of Sam Radebe (53) has asked the court not to grant the accused bail. Warrant Officer Gopal Naidoo was testifying during the accused’s bail application in the Verulam Magistrates Court on Thursday. He said the witnesses were known to Radebe. “The accused saw the witnesses on the day of the incident,” he said. One of the witnesses apparently received a threatening call from the accused’s family. Radebe’s lawyer Mondli Mthethwa asked the court to postpone the matter. He wanted to prepare for cross-examination. There were several issues he still needed to discuss with his client. Radebe is accused of killing his lover Nombuso Dube (33) and her mum Thokozile (70) last month. He allegedly went to Nombuso’s rented house in Magwaveni, Tongaat, and demanded to see her. The accused allegedly shot Thokozile when she tried to intervene. Radebe handed himself over to the police. Magistrate Vera Alamchand postponed the matter to Wednesday and  Radebe was kept in jail.
