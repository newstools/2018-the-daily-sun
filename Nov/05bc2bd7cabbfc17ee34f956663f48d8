PUBLIC Enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan says he advised
former president Jacob Zuma to follow proper processes on the nuclear deal. According to Gordhan, this was to avoid it becoming caught
up in scandal like the arms deal. Gordhan told the commission that in November 2011, a nuclear
cabinet committee was started. He says it was clear that the Department of Energy and Zuma
were intent on pursuing a R1-trillion nuclear deal with Russia. In 2013 Gordhan says he was called to a meeting at Mahlamba
Ndlopfu, by Zuma and told him he wanted the nuclear deal to continue. He says Senti Thobejane, who was an adviser to then Minister
of Energy Ben Martin was also present at that meeting. President Zuma reportedly took over the chairing of the
nuclear energy committee from then deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe in 2014. He says it was not so common that a president would chair a
cabinet committee in place of a deputy. Asked what event made him realise the difference between
corruption and state capture: Gordhan said "Individuals acts of corruption
were known" referring to bottles of water and price escalation. He says they noticed state capture when board members were
being changed. “Looked like an ordinary set of events "still wasn’t
clear when more of these pictures were being made, things were hazy." Gordhan says they started seeing signs of state capture late
2014 but things became clearer in 2015 when the #GuptaLeaks reports were made
public.
