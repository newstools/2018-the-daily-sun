A FORMER Kaizer Chiefs development player accused of murder has pleaded guilty. Thabo Lubisi (21) from Mkhuhlu near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga appeared in the Mhala Regional Court yesterday. He stabbed and killed Jonny Ndubane (43) during a fight at a local tavern on 31 December 2015. He admitted killing Ndubane and said he acted in self-defence after the dead man hit him. “I admit my action which led me to commit murder. It wasn’t my intention. I’m sorry.” His lawyer, Lucas Hlungwane, told the court the accused was doing second year business management studies at Richfield College. Magistrate Elmarie Theron said the court couldn’t prove that it was a premeditated murder, but found him guilty. She postponed the sentencing to 12 December for social workers to compile pre-sentencing reports. Devine Chicane (29) pleaded not guilty when his lawyer Erwin Sithole told the court his client denied all the allegations against him. Magistrate Tanya du Preez postponed the matter to 25 January for further investigation.
