MZANSI being hit by drought affects many villages which are suffering as dams run dry. Over 30 Mopani villages around Bolobedu in Limpopo will be left without water, because Modjadji Dam is close to empty. The Modjadji Water Scheme cannot supply water to villagers as a result. Lepelle Northern Water also cannot extract water from the dam, which is at 7,1%, as water pumps cannot pump when the water is so low. Municipal spokesman Witness Tiva said this serious situation will lead to water shortages in many areas. “The district municipality’s special council sitting approved water restrictions across its five local municipalities due to low dam levels. “The levels of most of our dams are much lower than last year,” he said. “Most affected are Middle Letaba Dam at 7,6%, Modjadji Dam at 7,1%, Nsami Dam at 28,9%, Tours Dam at 28,70% and Tzaneen Dam at 20,8%. The Thapane Dam in the Greater Tzaneen Municipal area is completely dry.” The municipality is holding meetings to find a short-term solution to the problem. “We are organising resources to help us activate water supply, using tankers in affected areas. More boreholes will be drilled to boost supply in many parts of the district.” Tiva said Mopani Municipality, Lepelle Northern Water and the water and sanitation department are meeting to find an urgent solution. “Villagers are urged to use any means necessary to save water at all times,” he said.
