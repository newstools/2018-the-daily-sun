MATSHIDISO Labasa and her two sons are homeless after a fire destroyed their shack on Friday last week. The 24-year-old from Itsoseng squatter camp, Tshwane, now suspects her jealous boyfriend started the fire. She told Daily Sun they had an argument on the day of the incident, after the man had accused her of cheating. Matshidiso said the shouting match quickly turned violent. “My boyfriend assaulted me and I ran towards my gogo’s house.” When she came back with her gogo, hoping to calm the man down, things got worse. “My gogo chased him away,’’ she said. “But 15 minutes after my gogo had left, my boyfriend came back and assaulted me.” She and the kids fled to her gogo’s house. While there, her neighbour came and delivered the bad news . . . Her shack was on fire! “We rushed there but the fire had already destroyed everything. “We’re now homeless. I suspect my boyfriend started the fire.” Matshidiso claimed her boyfriend would often threaten her when she wanted to end their stormy relationship. “He’d tell me all hell would break loose if I left him,” she said “I guess all hell did break loose because, now, my kids and I have lost everything,” she said. Sergeant Tumelo Menyatso said cases of arson and assault were opened. The suspect was arrested and appeared in the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrates Court.
