MYSTERY surrounds the death of a teenage girl. The lifeless body of Sibahle Ngco- ngo (13) was found on Sunday. She was lying on the veranda floor, with blood running from her nose and a rope around her neck. While her family suspect she was killed by a tokoloshe sent by evil people, they also think she may have hanged herself. They said they will get closure only once they have received the post mortem results. Sibahle (13), from Mbumbulu, south of Durban, was found dead by her mum, Maliza Ngcongo (41). Maliza said that on the day of the incident they had been sitting together in the house, but then Sibahle got up and left. She said she later decided to go looking for her daughter and was shocked to find her dead. “She showed no sign of wanting to kill herself. “She did not even complain about anything. I have a suspicion that someone sent a tokolo-she to kill her,” Maliza said. The family would consult a sangoma while they were waiting for the post mortem results. “We could not even see where she hanged herself, as we found her lying on the floor. The rope around her neck was not very tight.” Sibahle’s uncle, Damba Ngcongo (22), said she was a quiet child who spent most of her time at home with her mum and gogo. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Mbumbulu police were conducting an inquest and investigating the circumstances around the incident.
