Dear MizzB I am a 21-year-old woman who is in a relationship with a 19-year-old guy. We usually use protection, but my boyfriend recently stopped using condoms. When I asked him why he did that, he said there was no need for protection if I was being faithful to him. The problem is that I don’t trust him because we’ve only been dating for a month. What should I do? - Lady Dear Lady It is important to understand what you and your partner want. That means you have to talk about sex. If you’re uncomfortable with unprotected sex, it’s important to make your voice heard. It’s important to know your partner’s status. You have the right to use birth control and female condoms.
