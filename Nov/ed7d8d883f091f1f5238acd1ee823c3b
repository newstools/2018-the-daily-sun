THESE young friends are putting their village first. Themba Mgidi (22), Mduduzi Mahlangu (24) and Dumisani Mahlangu (25) from Mandela Village near Kwamhlanga, Mpumalanga have started cleaning the illegal dump in their area. They said they wanted to turn the space into a park. Mduduzi said they saw an opportunity after realising that illegal dumping was big problem in the village. “As unemployed friends, we decided to clear the illegal dump and turn it into a park,” he said. “Villagers will be allowed to run their small businesses in the park. “We want the park to benefit everyone in the area.” Themba said they didn’t want to be involved in criminal activities and that’s why they decided to clean the site. “Once we have finished, we will open a car wash and a gym for the residents. “We’ll also plant trees so we can host events like weddings and parties.” Dumisani said even though they were trying their best to clean the area, some people were still dumping rubbish. “But we won’t stop clearing it up. This area is going to benefit the villagers.”
