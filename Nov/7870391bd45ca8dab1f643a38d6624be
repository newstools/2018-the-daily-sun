LIKE dry ground after rain, this small society has blossomed with growth. Twananani Burial Society started with just 10 members a year ago, but now boasts 150! The society, based in Makuleke Village near Malamulele in Limpopo, is made up women. They meet once a month at the local sports grounds and contribute R20 each. Group leader Claudia Malulele (42) said: “My friend and I started this burial society in July last year. We had a problem: most burial societies in out area are too expensive for us. We cannot afford to pay R100 to R200 a month. “We knew you could not be alone, so we started our own which required a contribution of R20 every month. “We went from door to door asking our neighbours if any of them would be interested in joining Twananani. We found there were and still are many interested people – more join us all the time.” Malulele said if a member’s close relative dies, the society will pay R2 000 towards the burial. If a member dies, the society will pay R3 000 to the grieving family. Member Tsakani Majavula (41) said: “Our society is different from any other in the area because when we meet, we do not hang around and eat food. We pay and go. “It is important we all go together, to make sure the money is deposited in the society’s bank account. “We do this on the same day because we do not want to risk the money getting stolen by tsotsis in the area.”
