A BODY was washed up on the banks of the Vaal river. It was partly decomposed when residents at Tahiti Estate in Vanderbijlpark found it last April. It is not known whether the man drowned while fishing or was attacked as he had injuries to the face. Police spokesman Sergeant Simon Mofokatsane said the man’s body was wrapped in a green fishing net and his legs were tied together. “He could be about 35 years old and he was wearing a black T-shirt with Rogue Rebel written on it,” he said. Mofokatsane said no identity documents were found on him. He said although some people did come to identify the body, it was difficult because of the state of the body. “DNA tests were conducted but they did not match,” he said. To get the body identified, experts have drawn a picture of what the man might have looked like. “The drawing is 98% correct and we hope it will help us find the man’s family,” he said. He appealed to SunReaders to help find the family of the man. “Anyone who recognises the man in the drawing or has a family member missing should please visit their nearest police station or call 08600 10111,” said Mofokatsane.
