While other people were going to church to pray, robbers were busy with their evil deeds. Bank robbers made off with an undisclosed amount of money yesterday morning when they robbed a bank at Maitland. A witness told the SunTeam that men arrived with tools to cut open the ATM. “They jumped out of a car while another one was parked in the distance. I thought they came to fix the ATM because they were wearing work suits.” The 32-year-old man said all this happened in under 10 minutes. “They opened the door and I did not know it could open like that. They were fast and started taking boxes out of the bank and then left.” When police arrived at the scene, they found an empty ATM with the thugs long gone. Members of a church right next to the ATM were astonished. Churchgoer Michael Adeyemi said the police should bust the thugs before they pounce again. “It’s the festive season and they will be back again. This area is no longer safe and there are no patrols. Criminals do as they please. They must be arrested quickly.” Police Lieutenant-Colonel Andrè Traut said police were working hard to bring those responsible to book. “A housebreaking and theft case was registered. No one has been arrested yet.”
