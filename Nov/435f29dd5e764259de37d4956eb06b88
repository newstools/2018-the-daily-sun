LIFE was very difficult for us here, but we don’t feel like a deserted community anymore. This were the words of Thandiwe Springbok from Postmasburg. Thandiwe spoke to Daily Sun when she brought her sick child to the newly built clinic in the area. “We are grateful to Kolomela Mine for this clinic.  “All of us in the three sections of Postmasburg used to go the hospital for the services that we get here at the new clinic. “The hospital was not enough because sometimes people went back home without getting any help,” said Thandiwe. People from villages near Postmasburg in the Northern Cape had to travel, sometimes on foot, about 30 kilometres to get to a clinic. The arrival of Anglo American’s Kolomela Mine in Postmasburg brought not only opportunities for the local people, but also healthcare support. Keaobaka Matilo of Kolomela Mine told Daily Sun the project brought relief to patients and created jobs as they employed people who drove the mobile clinics as well as nurses to help patients. “The clinic, which has been split from the hospital, has six consulting rooms, a pharmacy, a reception area and a medication storage area,” he said.
