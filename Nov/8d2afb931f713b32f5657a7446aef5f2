TWO weeks ago her friend’s ex-lover beat her up. He threatened to harm her if she didn’t tell him where her friend was. But she never thought he would cause her a mother’s worst nightmare. Lindiswa Khuboni (37) from Copesville in Pietermaritzburg, KZN Midlands, was devastated yesterday to learn that her son Andile Fihla (11), who went missing on 9 November, had died. According to the cops, the suspect (28) was bust after handing himself over at the Pietermaritzburg Central Police Station. He apparently took police to the bushes in Bluebell Drive, Northdale, where the boy’s head was found under a rock covered with clothes. He led them to another area, where the boy’s decomposed body was found. Lindiswa said: “I can’t speak.” On Tuesday, she told Daily Sun that on 7 November the suspect beat her and fractured her hand while looking for her friend. “I opened a case against him,” she said. When he saw her on 9 November, he told her that her fractured hand was nothing compared to the pain he was going to cause her. A few hours later, after she had heard from a neighbour that the suspect was seen talking to her son while the boy was on his way to school, she called the school and heard Andile had not arrived. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “A murder case was opened at Mountain Rise. “The suspect will appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court soon.”
