IDOLS SA season 14 is fast drawing to a close and there were so many unexpected surprises, some pleasant and some not so much, but there’s one fascinating underdog whose rise to prominence shocked many. His name is Thato Makape. While is not the most gifted vocalist, he oozes determination, drive and resilience – all the qualities needed in such a cutthroat competition. Having travelling from Delft out of Cape Town using buses and taxis, it’s clear to see that Thato is hungry for this and maybe this is one of the reasons he is in the top two. On the other hand, Yanga Sebetwa was always edged out of the top 16, but she fought to keep her place in the competition. Week in and week out, she has shown Mzansi why she deserves to be the competition, but now it remains to be seen which of these incredibly tenacious singers will take the coveted title this coming Sunday  as they vie in front of millions of viewers.
