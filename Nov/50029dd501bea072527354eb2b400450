A PROMOTER wants to take Babes Wodumo to court following a no-show. Babes Wodumo, whose real name is Bongekile Simelane, was billed to perform in Leicester City on 27 October and in Dublin, Ireland, but only showed up in Dublin. DJ Mkhukhwini, whose real name is Ndumiso Dlamini, cancelled the Leicester show. Fans were enraged. Babes took to Twitter to apologise, saying her gogo had died and there were hiccups with the promoter. She warned artists about DJ Mkhukhwini on Instagram, saying the UK venue wasn’t paid for when she got there. Mkhukhwini apologised to everyone who bought tickets on Facebook and promised to refund them. A source told Daily Sun  Babes never got to England. “They didn’t have visas. Mkhukhwini flew to Mzansi to fix her problems and paid for things they didn’t agree on so his event would be a success. “Mzansi must see her for who she is. She always ruins promoters’ reputations.” Mkhukhwini said he was suing Babes. Her sister and manager Nondumiso said: “Travelling to the UK, we heard about our gogo’s death, but because Babes didn’t want to disappoint people, we went to England. “When we got to the venue, we were told it wasn’t paid for. Mkhukhwini still owes us money for the gig, but we decided to let it go.”
