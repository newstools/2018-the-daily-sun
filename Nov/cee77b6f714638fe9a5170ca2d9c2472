PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa spoke at the National Gender-based Violence and Femicide Summit in Irene, Tshwane, yesterday. As he delivered his speech, women protesters held up panties with the names of victims of sexual violence. The day got off to an emotional start, with many panellists telling stories of abuse and victimisation. Ramaphosa and National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete listened to stories about gender-based violence victims. People shed tears and sympathised with their testimonies. One of the women identified herself as Martha. The inmate, who’s serving life, told how she was bust over her abusive husband’s murder. He attacked her while she was pregnant. She spoke about her daughter, who was four when she was bust and now is 19. “Every day she would ask me, mummy when are you coming home?” People in the hall shouted: “Release her!” The president said families often put pressure on women and children not to lay charges against abusers. He was sure that, by working together, a society where all women and children are safe could be created. “I call on all South Africans to become champions in the fight against gender-based violence.”
