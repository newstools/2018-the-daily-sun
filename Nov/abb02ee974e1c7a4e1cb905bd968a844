POLOKWANE City are anticipating a tough clash when they come up against on-form Cape Town City in their Absa Premiership match at Limpopo’s Peter Mokaba Stadium tonight (7.30pm). Benni McCarthy’s charges come into this clash on the back of two consecutive league wins against AmaZulu and Black Leopards respectively. The Citizens scored six goals in those two games, beating AmaZulu 3-1 and recording an impressive 3-0 win against struggling Lidoda Duvha, leading to Joel Masutha falling on his sword for the Venda side. Rise and Shine’s Slovakian mentor Jozef Vukusic has warned his players to expect a tough clash tonight. “Cape Town City are a big team with a good coach in Benni,” said Vukusic. “They have done well in their last two games, scoring many goals in the process. So we have to be good to get the result against them. We cannot afford to underestimate them. We have to fight for the result.” The last time City lost a league clash was last month, to Bidvest Wits. They are currently eighth in the table with 13 points from 10 games. Rise and Shine are seventh, five points ahead of the Citizens, but have played one game more. Johnny Mogaladi’s side has enjoyed a good run in the first round of the season. They have won five, lost three and drawn three of their 11 league games and Vukusic aims to finish the first round among the top eight. He said: “Our aim is to be in the top eight when we break for Christmas. We know all four our remaining games before the break will be tough, starting with the clash with Cape Town City. Things will remain challenging when we come back for the second round and we want to make things easier for ourselves in the first round.” The only hiccup for Vukusic is the news that his trusted goalkeeper, George Chigova, is doubtful for this clash due to a knee injury. But the coach will rely on veteran captain Jabu Maluleke as well as Rodney Ramagalele for goals up-front, while McCarthy will put his trust in Siphelele Mthembu and Thabo Nodada.
