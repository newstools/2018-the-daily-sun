THE mining town of Welkom was rocked by a kidnapping incident on Wednesday. A gang of nine men kidnapped a 43-year-old woman, hoping to score loads of money. But their greed was their downfall when the Hawks bust them on Friday with a solid gold trap. The Hawks also confiscated almost R1 million in cash, six cars and gold nuggets. Free State Hawks spokesman Captain S’fiso Nyakane said Hawks, local cops, mine security and Bidvest Coin Security conducted an early morning raid that resulted in the arrest of the nine men. Nyakane told Daily Sun: “The delivery of gold they demanded was made in Welkom and the victim was released unharmed. “The members continued to track the suspects and eventually arrested them in Welkom CBD and Odendaalsrus. “The suspects, aged between 31 and 38, were charged with kidnapping and theft of an unwrought precious metal. “Some of the suspects are from Sebokeng and Vereeniging. They will make their first court appearance at Welkom Magistrates Court soon. Investigations continue.”
