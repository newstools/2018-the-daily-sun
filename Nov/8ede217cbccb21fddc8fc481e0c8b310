The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) staff is wearing black in protest of the broadcaster's plans to fire half of its employees. While they plan to protest on Friday and plan to protest daily from next week. The public broadcaster is preparing to retrench over 981 workers. SABC chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini, said 1200 freelancers will also be affected. According to Makhathini the public broadcaster looks at taking productions of several shows in-house, instead of outsourcing it to production companies. The SABC issued a notice to all staff informing them of the SABC’s intention to proceed with Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act (“LRA”). “It is envisaged that all employees and at all levels in the SABC will be affected by the restructuring. This would include Group Services, Provincial Operations, Commercial Enterprises, Media Technology and Infrastructure, News, Radio, Sport and Television,” Makhathini said.
