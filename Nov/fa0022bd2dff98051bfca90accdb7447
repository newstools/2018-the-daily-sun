BAROKA FC advanced to the Telkom Knockout Cup semifinals after beating Absa Premiership giants Mamelodi Sundowns 2-0 at the Peter Mokaba Stadium yesterday. Baroka were on fire and produced a knockout performance to kick Downs out of this competition which has a purse of R4 million to the winners. The home side’s goal was scored by Mduduzi Mdantsane and an own goal by Downs keeper Reyaad Pieterse. In the first half, both Baroka and Downs did not create many scoring chances. The home team’s only chance was the penalty which Mdantsane converted. Downs only dominated the ball position but lacked the creativity of their captain Hlompo Kekane, who was not part of the team. But whatever Mosimane told his lads at half time, seems to have worked, as the Pretoria side came back much stronger putting pressure on the home side. Seeing that his striker Toni Silva seemed to be tired and struggling, the former Bafana Bafana coach introduced Jeremy Brockie in the 59th minute. Thopa introduced experienced defender Matome Kgoetyane for striker Talent Chawapiwa as Downs were attacking them at all angles. Baroka extended the lead in the 67th minute after a mistake by goalkeeper Pieterse as he was trying to stop Kgoetyane’s ball. After extending their lead Baroka started to enjoy themselves played with confidence. Baroka created many goal scoring chances, but they were let down by their final touches. Mosimane should also have himself to blame for this defeat as he underestimated the Limpopo based side.
