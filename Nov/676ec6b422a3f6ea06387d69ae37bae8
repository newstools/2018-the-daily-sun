LIKE an old tree that has survived all kinds of weather, so has their friendship. They first met when they started playing soccer as children on the dusty streets of Winterveldt in the 1970s and 1980s. Their team, Roman Catholic Football Club, was a force to be reckoned with at the time. But once they reached adulthood other concerns pushed them apart in different directions. Fate played its hand, however, and they all rediscovered each other over the years. They reignited their friendship, and to keep united they decided to start the Maroma Social Club. Maroma was formed in 2015 with just 10 members but over the three years, its membership grew to 25. It was a club for socialising but it has become a society too. In the third week of the month the members meet to talk business and contribute R250. General secretary and community leader, Moses Ndaba, gave the SunStokvel team a detailed breakdown on how contributions work. “R110 is saved for burial cover, R40 is for food and refreshments, R50 is for the stokvel and the last R50 is for the club’s finances.” Their meetings rotate around different venues. While it seems like an old boys club, disciplinary committee member Thomas Mlombo was quick to dismiss the notion that women were not allowed to their club. “Our doors are open to women. Unfortunately, no women has decided to join us yet.” Mlombo said: “Our 10-year plan is to grow even bigger and invest our savings by buying shares. We aim to become self-sufficient.” They are now printing T-shirts branded with the club’s name.
