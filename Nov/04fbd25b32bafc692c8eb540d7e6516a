RESIDENTS of Kanana squatter camp, Gugulethu are unhappy with the decision to move them. They claimed ward 40 Councillor Bongani Ngcombolo told them they had to move and make space for a housing project in the area. Luyanda Msongo (28) said: “If we have to move to allow a housing project to take place, I want to know who is going to live in these houses? I’ve lived here for more than 10 years and now we have to move. This is not fair.” The squatters said they would only move if houses were built for them. “We’ll only move if they can promise us that we’ll occupy the houses once they’ve been completed,” said Lulama Vabantu (53). Ngcombolo said the space in Kanana would only allow for 700 houses to be built. That’s why they were moving people to another area. “Less than 30 people came to my office to say they wouldn’t move, even though the camp has about 5 000 households. We’re moving them to an area which already has houses.” Ntomboxolo Makoba-Somdaka, spokeswoman for the Western Cape Human Settlements Department, said: “The housing development is meant for squatters. “But there is not enough space for everybody. Some people are being moved to Mfuleni.”
