“The desire to prevent our family from giving Jabba a
dignified send-off is insensitive and atrocious at best.” This was said by the family of Jabulani “HHP” Tsambo in response
to the court order by his partner Lerato Sengadi. Sengani brought an urgent court application seeking to
prevent the burial of Jabba this coming Saturday. The family said that at worst, the action is tantamount
to an act of violence on the memory and legacy of Jabba, who touched millions
of lives through his music and personal interactions with his fans. Tsambo family spokesperson Nkululeko Ncana said lawyers
are currently dealing with the matter. “As law abiding citizen's we have full confidence in our
courts and believe that a reasonable outcome in the interest of justice will be
arrived at. In the immediate, we will not be responding to Ms
Sengadi's outrageous and sensational claims contained in her founding
affidavit, which seek to impugn the good image and person of Jabba. “At the appropriate time, the shameful untruths peddled
with the aim soliciting sympathy from an unsuspecting public will be adequately
addressed. It is deplorable and in bad taste that rather than mourning Jabba,
matters of self-interest and grandstanding are elevated above all else,
especially during this painful period. “It is a shame that our beloved Jabba is not around to
dismiss off hand the lies that have been peddled about him. Everyone that ever
crossed his path will attest to his loving nature,” said Ncana.
