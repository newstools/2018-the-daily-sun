WHAT started off as a teenager being naughty ended in tragedy on Saturday. After going for a joyride in his parents’ car and causing an accident, a 17-year-old boy allegedly killed himself dead at the Gamalakhe Community Health Centre on Saturday. A health worker told Daily Sun the boy’s surname was Ngcobo and he was from the ZG area of Port Shepstone, KZN South Coast. Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo said the boy arrived at the centre with cops. “It’s alleged the youngster had stolen his parents’ car and gone on a joyride. However, he got involved in a crash with a minibus taxi, which resulted in some of its occupants being injured. He was caught and severely assaulted by residents. Cops then came to his rescue and took him to the healthcare centre to determine whether or not he had been drinking.” Dhlomo said the boy overpowered a cop, grabbed his gun and shot himself. “To lose a child over something that started as mischief and ended in such a tragic manner must be unbearable to deal with.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “Police at Gamalakhe cop shop are investigating an inquest docket and a case of reckless and negligent driving.”
