Soccer legend Mike 'Sporo' Mangena has been granted R50 000 bail in the Randfontein Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Mangena appeared with three other suspects. They were charged with manufacturing drugs at a drug lab situated on a property owned by the former soccer star. The co-accused have been denied bail and will remain in custody until their next court appearance on February 21. Last week, cops  pounced on the plot in Hillside, Randfontein, and discovered drugs with an estimated street value of about R50 million. While cops were combing the scene, a white bakkie arrived driven by the owner of the plot, the well-known soccer star. According to sources, when police raided the plot the star was not on the property. “He was called and came to the plot. Then he was taken to the police station in a cop van,” said the source. Three suspects who were found on the premises were arrested.
