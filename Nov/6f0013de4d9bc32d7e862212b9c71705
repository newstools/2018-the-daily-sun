THESE days many people do not care about their neighbours or look out for them. But these two families are showing the rest of South Africa how neighbours should treat each other. The RDP houses of the Tshepe and Matheba families in Fateng Tse Ntso near Paul Roux, Free State, have painted their walls with similar art and help each other whenever they can. Nelly Tshepe (33) told Daily Sun: “I arrived at this house and immediately clicked with my neighbour, Nkemeleng Matheba (36). “Most neighbours have beef with each other, but you will never find that between us.” When the SunTeam visited the area, Nkemeleng was not home, but she confirmed everything Nelly said over the phone. “I am not home because we have to attend a family traditional ceremony. “Nelly has my key so she can check if everything is still OK in the house,” she said. “We trust each other and I love her family very much. We want to show other people how to love and respect their neighbours. This will reduce housebreakings and promote love.” The two neighbours said they got the same art painted on their walls last March. “There was a woman who approached the community and asked if she could donate paint. “Most residents were not interested, but we decided to take up the offer,” said Nelly. “We decided to have the same art on our walls because of the love and respect we have for each other.” Resident Thabang Sejake (41) said he wished everyone in Mzansi could follow the two families’ example.
