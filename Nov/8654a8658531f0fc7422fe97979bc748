TV and radio personality, Anele Mdoda has joined forces with two of her 947 colleagues to form a brand new content production company. Anele and her fellow 947 Breakfast colleagues, Frankie du Toit, and Paul Buys who has been in the television industry for over 15 years, have launched Rose and Oaks; Anele being the rose and Frankie and Paul being the oaks. The company’s aim is to create original concepts for television productions from series to advertising. Speaking to The Media Online, Anele said that they hope to have their shows bought by international TV channels. “You know how shows make it around the world, so there’s a flagship one and then franchises around the world, like Survivor. Those are called original concepts and that’s what we’re coming up with. They are started in South Africa and then can be sold around the world,” she told the publication. Anele and her co-founders are currently developing three original concept shows and she says that there is some interest in the shows already. She went on to say that we need to get the point where the international audience no longer just takes our talent and turns them into stars, they must also buy our ideas. “We’ve been feeding them our talent for a while now, they’ve been taking our people, now take our content, now take our ideas,” she continued.
