NDUDUZO Mthombeni (47) has been missing since 6 October. His family from Umlazi Z section, south of Durban said Nduduzo wasn’t feeling well when he disappeared. His mum, Sizakele Mthombeni (64), told Daily Sun that Nduduzo had suffered a stroke, which affected his mind. “He had started talking to himself and he had to use nappies, because he couldn’t feel when nature called and he’d end up soiling himself,” Sizakele said. She said she couldn’t stop thinking of Nduduzo every day and wondering whether he was safe. “I looked after him following the stroke. On the day he disappeared we had a chat and he went to his room. “But when I went to check up after a few minutes, he was nowhere to be found,” Sizakele said. She told the People’s Paper it was the first time her son had gone missing. “I’m worried about his whereabouts. “I just pray that he’s found alive because I haven’t been myself since he disappeared.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that cops at Bhekithemba are appealing to residents to help them find missing Nduduzo. “He was last seen wearing brown trousers and black shoes. “He is mentally disturbed. “Anyone with information about his whereabouts should contact police on 031 909 9923 or 08600 10111,” said Zwane.
