COPS are looking for a mine shift boss who disappeared after visiting his girlfriend on Friday. Police said the disappearance of Fernando Mungoi (56), who worked at Phakisa Mine near Welkom, was possibly linked to an attack at his house. Free State police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said Mungoi was not home when thugs stormed into his house at Kutlwanong on the 19th of last month. Thakeng told Daily Sun: “His son was sleeping when two unknown men stormed into the house. “They tied up the son and demanded their money, saying Mungoi had taken their friend’s R200 000 and they were looking for him. “He wasn’t at home but at work and the thugs tied up the son with a wire hanger. They stole three wrist watches, a plasma TV and a Toyota Conquest. “A case of house robbery was opened but no arrests have been made.” Thakeng said Mungoi, who is originally from Mozambique, was reported missing by his girlfriend. “He had visited his girlfriend in his silver grey Toyota Hilux with registration number ANANMP FS. His two cellphones were switched off when contacted,” he said. Thakeng said anyone with information should contact Lieutenant-Colonel Dirk Reinecke at 082 466 8041, go to their nearest police station or phone CrimeStop on 0860 10111.
