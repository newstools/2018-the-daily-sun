SHE quit her job after a fake sangoma convinced her to do so. He ran away with her life savings. But as fate would have it, the man recently walked into the supermarket where Phumelela Jacob (41) worked. “It is God’s way. I know this man thought he would never see me again. But that’s why I called the police,” said Phumelela, from Philippi East in Cape Town. She said the man from Malawi ruined her life last year when he conned her out of R375 000. He promised to double the money. “I wanted to start a business and I saw his number in one of the local newspapers. I called and met him. “He told me to resign from work so he could double my money,” said Phumelela. She said she followed his instructions and resigned. The con man visited Phumelela at her house, where he took R6 800 and mixed it with eggs and locked it in a box. Once Phumelela’s pension was paid out, she contacted the man. She said they went to Promenade Mall in Mitchell’s Plain to withdraw the money. “When we arrived at the bank, he had a dirty white plastic bag where we put all my money. “We then went back to my house where he dropped me off, saying he had to take the money to the beach to the ancestors,” she said. “That man planned everything carefully.” Captain Siyabulela Vukubi from Harare police confirmed that a 38-year-old suspect had recently been arrested. The man appeared in the Khayelitsha Magistrates Court last Monday on charges of theft under false pretences. He remains in custody.
