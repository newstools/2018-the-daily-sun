It has been just over a month since the passing of iconic Motswako rapper HHP, real Jabulani Tsambo and the loss has not sunk in just yet for his loved ones. The feud between his customary wife Lerato Sengadi and his family dominated the headlines in the days that followed his passing, giving neither party the chance to grieve properly. With the bitter feud seemingly dying down in the past few weeks, Sengadi has shared how she is coping with the loss of her husband. “It’s been a month. Feels like an eternity. Feels like yesterday. Feels so surreal. But the grief is so real. I know the strength God has bestowed upon me is a gift from you,” Lerato captioned a picture of herself with HHP. It’s been a month.
