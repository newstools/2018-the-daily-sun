ANOTHER cop has been shot dead in Ladanna, Polokwane, Limpopo on Thursday. National police commissioner General Khehla Sitole has condemned the killing of the constable. Sitole said: “Constable Petrus de Lange (30) was on duty observing possible drug dealing in Ladanna at the time of his death. “A group of suspects driving in two cars stopped near the constable’s vehicle and four men started shooting at De Lange” Sitole said the constable died on his way to hospital. “It’s been reported that during the shooting, a truck driver was also shot. “He was caught by a stray bullet and sustained an injury to his hand.” Sitole has ordered cops to urgently identify and bring the culprits to book. “The number of cops being attacked and killed remains at an unacceptable level despite proactive and reactive actions,” said Sitole. De Lange’s killing brings the number of cops killed to 42 since April. Sitole said 18 cops were killed in the line of duty, while 24 were off duty. Police have appealed to anyone with information about the attack to call 086000 10111. Sitole said callers may remain anonymous and all information will be treated confidentially.
