THE gogo’s daughter used to check on her every morning to see how she had slept. But on Tuesday morning, Mokgaetji Hika (72) of Naledi Village in Ga-Mashashane was found lying dead in her bed, in a pool of blood. The family said the trunk in which she saved her social grant money had also gone missing. It seems the gogo, who lived with her 16-year-old nephew, was hacked to death with a panga. Because it was raining heavily, her nephew allegedly slept at his mum’s home on the night of the murder. Villagers came in their numbers to pay their last respects when they heard of the tragedy. Gogo’s firstborn, Anna Maapola (50) said she was at work when she was called to her mum’s house, only to find her dead. “The people who killed her are heartless. She had six stab wounds in her head and stomach. “She died a painful death.” Suspects gained entry to the house through a back window. Anna also told Daily Sun she used to call her mum at 4am and was worried that morning when she did not answer her phone. “I didn’t suspect anything. “I thought she was still sleeping. We are so sad she was murdered like this.” Constable Mienkie Ramakgoakgoa said they are worried about elderly people’s murders. “We condemn the victimising of elderly people. “Residents are urged to look after them to avoid these incidents and stop neglecting them, because it makes them targets.” A case of murder is being investigated. Anyone with information that could lead to an arrest should call Constable Sidney Hlaku at 072 8418 704, or their nearest police station.
