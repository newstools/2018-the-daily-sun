GOGO Mellitah Mamabolo (68) has been living in pain for many years. The gogo from Sizanani squatter camp in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, lost her husband and three children in a car accident in 2008. But the worst was yet to come. “After an operation in 2013, both my legs became swollen and I struggled to walk.” When the SunTeam visited Mellitah, she cried and said she needed a powerful sangoma to help her. “If my children were still alive, they would be taking care of me,” she said. Mellitah is struggling to cope with the unbearable pain of losing her family and failing to find a cure for her condition. “Death is better than what I’m going through. “I don’t have food, relatives or an RDP,” she said. Mellitah said she had spent all her money on prophets and sangomas but none of them could help. She said she felt a lot of pain at night. The gogo said doctors told her the condition was a result of old age, while prophets and sangomas said she was bewitched. As there are no roads where Mellitah lives, her new husband James Tjatjie (58) helps her use her wheelchair whenever she wants to get around. James told Daily Sun: “It’s sad to witness my wife going through this painful condition. “We have spent all our money trying to help her. “We don’t know what to do now.” Provincial health spokesman Lesemang Matuka said Mellitah was taken to a nearby hospital for assessment. “It’s our duty to serve our communities. “We will do our best with the limited resources we have to provide the best healthcare service we can,” he said. He said whenever community members called for help they tried to provide it. Matuka said in extreme situations, people shouldn’t hesitate to call Gauteng EMS on 011 564 2000. Social Development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said: “The department is working on the matter. “We will send social workers to attend to Mellitah.” Sangoma Humphrey Nkomo said Mellitah was bewitched by people who were jealous of her. He said she needed a powerful sangoma to heal her.
