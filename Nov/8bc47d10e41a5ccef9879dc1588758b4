South Africans have, of course, reacted to the shocking and sudden passing of Lerato Khanye who was the mother of Leano Tsambo. This comes just one month after Leano lost his father, Mostwako icon, Jabulani ‘HHP’ Tsambo. Lerato died at a Johannesburg hospital in the early hours of the Monday morning but the cause of death has not yet been revealed. Family spokesman, Nkululeko Ncana confirmed the news to Daily Sun yesterday and also asked that the nation respect the family’s privacy. The news also comes amid a lot of feuding between the Tsambo family, HHP’s wife Lerato Sengadi, and baby mamma Lerato Khanye.
