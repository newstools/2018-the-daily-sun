MABUYI believes the hospital is responsible for her mum’s death. She said she was disappointed with the way nurses treated her mum while she was in hospital. After being admitted to GJ Crookes Hospital in KZN, Lindiwe Mkhize (59) died a week later. She was buried on Saturday. Her daughter Mabuyi (27) from Umzinto in KZN claimed the hospital is guilty of negligence. She said her mum was recovering well during the week she spent at the hospital. “The family was happy that she would be coming back home.” But when Mabuyi visited her mum on 2 November, she saw her condition had worsened. “I asked her what made her weak again. She told me she fell from her bed at night and called for help but the nurses ignored her. “She said she cried for help while on the floor but none of the nurses responded.” Mabuyi said her mum told her even other patients called the nurses but they still didn’t come. “She told me she was eventually put in her bed in the morning. “She spent the whole night on the cold floor.” Mabuyi said she strongly believed her mum would still be alive if the nurses had helped her when she fell out of bed. “I want them to be investigated. They must explain why they treated my mother in this manner,” she said. KZN Health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said: “The department would like to convey its deepest condolences to the family. “We are concerned by the serious allegations in the query and confirm this matter is being investigated at a high level. If anyone is found guilty of an offence, the appropriate action will be taken.”
