A 24-year-old woman has spoken out after she was left
with a 'botched' boob job. Kara Antonio, from Perth, travelled to Bali to undergo a
breast augmentation. She paid a surgeon $8,500 (R118000) to fix her
asymmetrical breasts on November 14. When she woke from surgery, her new breasts were not what
she had hoped for. The Daily Mail reports that Kara Antonio had her first
boob job in 2013 - but she decided to get them done again after they were left uneven
from breastfeeding her daughter. So, on November 14, the 24-year-old mother from Perth,
Western Australia, flew to Bali and paid a surgeon $8,500 (R118000) to fix
them. But when she woke from the procedure, she was left
devastated by what the doctors had done. “I was distraught, my breasts were disgusting,' Ms
Antonio told Daily Mail Australia. “All he'd done was move my nipples and put bigger
implants in thinking my boobs would be lifted. I started crying as soon as he
took the bandages off. “I didn't pay for my nipples to be moved up, I paid for a
breast revision with a lift and bigger implants. My boobs are ruined.' She said. She claimed when she complained about her new breasts,
she was told there was 'nothing wrong with them' and they 'looked fine'. 'No one in their right mind would tell someone their
boobs looked good when clearly they are f***ed,' she told the publication. Antonio was then offered a 'complimentary' corrective
surgery to fix her breasts. 'I was desperate to have them fixed so I accepted the
offer,' she said.
