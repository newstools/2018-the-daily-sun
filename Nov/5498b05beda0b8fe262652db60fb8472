Local music sensation, Sho Madjozi has announced the official release date of her much-awaited debut album. The songwriter, rapper and poet whose real name is Maya Wegerif has been so busy, booking TV gigs, event performances, international trips, awards, endorsement deal and a massive fan base, it is almost hard to believe that she actually hasn’t released a single album. Talk about star power; that a Xitsonga-speaking artist from Limpopo who was unheard-of artist two years ago can create such a firestorm of success around herself with no album is almost unimaginable. But Sho Madjozi has done it and her star will continue to rise with the release of her debut album. No one in the entertainment business right now can command a stage like she can, no one raps over Gqom beats (or Swahili Gqom as she calls it) like she can, and no one is as humble as she is while doing it. And on the 14th of December, when she releases Limpopo Champions League, of which she is the MVP, her staying power will be settled once and for all, and a brand new era in South African music will dawn. The 13-track album will feature the already wildly successful singles, Huku and Wakanda Forever. It will also feature industry pioneers like Kwesta, PH, and Ycee. We, together with her adoring fans, cannot wait to hear Sho Madjozi’s full body of work and look forward to seeing what she comes up with at the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 showcase. My first album #LIMPOPOCHAMPIONSLEAGUE drops Friday the 14th of December. Flourish and Multiply, forever ???? A post shared by  Maya (@shomadjozi) on Nov 26, 2018 at 5:37am PST
