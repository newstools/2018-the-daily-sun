WHAT was supposed to be a day of watching soccer together at a shebeen ended in death on Saturday. Three patrons were shot and one of them was killed in a tavern at Airport Valley squatter camp. A fight apparently started while Bafana Bafana were playing against Nigeria. A 30-year-old witness said: “We were watching soccer when the suspect pulled out a gun and shot someone dead. “The suspect had apparently bought some ladies booze. “He got angry when he saw one of the ladies speaking to another man,” said the witness. “The victim was shot in the chest while trying to stop a fight between the suspect and the other man.” The witness said that patrons started running out of the tavern and the gunman left. “Five minutes later the suspect came back and confronted another patron who was outside the tavern. “He said he felt undermined by the other patron. He shot him and another person several times. He then fled the scene,” said the witness. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said a 36-year-old was arrested for murder and attempted murder. “A 24-year-old man was shot on the left side of his back and died at the scene. A 27-year-old man was wounded in the shoulder and another man, whose age is unknown, was shot several times,” she said. Naidu said the suspect was expected to appear in court today.
