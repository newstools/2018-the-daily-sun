NOBODY wants to be reminded about cancer all the time but it is an important consideration. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer suffered by South African women after breast cancer. Due to limited access to HPV vaccinations, early diagnosis and treatment, cervical cancer is often fatal. While cervical cancer strikes, on average, about a third of the women breast cancer strikes, cervical cancer ends up taking more lives. The fight against cervical cancer needs to broken down into three stages. Vaccinations Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccines need to be rolled out. The vaccinations will reduce the infection rate, which later greatly reduce the chances of cervical cancer forming. Vaccinations need to target all schoolgirls between nine and 15 years old. Currently the vaccination programme is offered through a school health programme. It targets girls in grade 4 but all schools, public and private, the neediest, special schools and most wealthy need to be included in the roll out. Detecting cancer Cervical cancer is detected through a screening system. Women who are 30 years or older are encouraged to request the cervical cancer screening or Pap smear when they visit the facilities. If your blood tests positive for HIV, you are also encouraged to request the cervical cancer screening, regardless of your age, as long as you are sexually active. Treatment If cancer or pre-cancerous growths are discovered, the timing of treatment becomes critical. The earlier any cancer is diagnosed and the sooner treatment can start, the better your chances of defeating it. If the cancer is too old, fast and aggressive, fighting it becomes increasingly difficult. For this reason it is important for an annual screening – people who detect and diagnose cancer before it starts hurting them have the best chance of defeating it. Don’t ignore a problem that’s bothering you – get it checked out by visiting your nearest clinic or healthcare provider.
