DENZIL Jafta’s son was buried as a pauper at Turffontein Cemetery in Joburg while his dad was still looking for him. Dean (19) went missing in May last year. Understandably, his dad is hurt. After all, Denzil did post photos on social media, asking people to help him find his son. He said he was not given a chance to identify the body, which was apparently found in Midrand, north of Joburg. Denzil from Eersterust, Tshwane, told Daily Sun he only heard about his son’s death last Thursday. According to him, police said his son’s body was found in May last year in Blue Hills, Midrand, and he was buried in August of the same year. “I’ve been in the dark all these months, asking, searching, calling and using all means to find my son, who’d been lying in the wrong grave for many months,” he said. He said when he heard the news on radio that a body had been found in Midrand, he enquired at the Eersterust Police Station. He was told that the body was that of a man in his 40s. Denzil told the SunTeam he wanted to bury his son properly. “This is torture. I’m suffering emotionally. “I want those who killed my son to be prosecuted.” He said he wanted police to conduct a thorough investigation. Gauteng Community Safey MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane visited Denzil on Monday. He said the MEC had assured him that those responsible for the murder would be brought to book.
