A PROJECT vendors thought would improve their lives has become a disappointment. When vegetable sellers from Machibini Village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, found out the municipality was spending R1 million on market stalls in 2016, they thought their days of suffering in the sun were over. But two years later, they are still forced to stay home when it rains because they have no shelter. Street vendor Thuleleni Mthiyane (37) said the project was completed within three months but was never opened. “We don’t know why it was never opened for us because when the weather is bad we’re forced to stay at home and not make any money,” she said. Florence Mkhwanazi (41) said the money spent on the project just went down the drain. “We can’t even use the stalls because they’re behind a fence and the gates are locked,” she said. “The building has been damaged by rain and other bad weather.” Councillor Mxolisi Mthethwa said he had asked the municipality what was going on with the project but had got no answers. “They keep on telling me they have plans for the stalls but fail to outline their plans to me,” he said. Municipal spokesman Mduduzi Mahlinza confirmed the stalls were built by the municipality but said there were arguments over who would benefit. “In recent months we have been engaging with them so we’re looking at handing the stalls over in January,” he said.
