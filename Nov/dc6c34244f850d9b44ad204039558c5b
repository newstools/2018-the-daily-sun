RESIDENTS of Ipopeng in Mangaung live in fear because the Maroma gang terrorises them. On Saturday the gang broke windows at five homes during its recruitment drive. Members of the community promised to take the law into their own hands and accused cops of not doing their jobs. Resident Ntswaki Shokwe (45) said: “A group of about 50 boys came to my house and broke my windows. “They demanded that my nephew join them.” She said the group previously attacked a house close to hers. “I never thought my house would be next. My family and I went to the local cop shop to report the matter, but the officers told us they couldn’t leave the station as there were only two of them on duty.” Ntswaki said the violent recruitment drive started last week after a boy was murdered for refusing to join the group. “We do not want gangsters in our neighbourhood. “If the cops don’t do anything we’ll take the law into our own hands.” Itumeleng Sello (33), another resident, said: “The members of the group rob everyone they see. “I can’t even go for a walk because I’m afraid they might stab me to death.” Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said the local cop shop was not understaffed. “On Thursday, 12 members of the rival Born to Kill gang were arrested for a murder that occurred the previous weekend. “Four cases of malicious damage to property were registered after windows were broken by members of another gang. “Public order policing and crime intelligence officers managed to stabilise the situation. “Members of the public order policing unit remained in the area to monitor the situation. “There was never a time when the police station here was short-staffed.”
