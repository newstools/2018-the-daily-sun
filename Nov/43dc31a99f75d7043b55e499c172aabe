K ENNY Maistry has had a lifetime of uniting listeners through music. The 49-year-old DJ from Pietermaritzburg, KZN can be considered a veteran of radio. He uses his soothing and comforting vocal presence and songs to bring people together. Through the radio he creates a personal interaction with his listeners as they relate to the music he plays and the stories he tells. Kenny is at 702 Talk Radio and presents 702 Music on Saturdays from 10 am till 2pm and Soulful Sundays from 10am till 1pm. He joined the station in 2013 as a music compiler and presenter of Solid Gold. “I play mostly 80s and 90s old school music. With Solid Gold we played mostly 50s, 60s and 70s music,” he said. “My shows make me feel young again. Listeners enjoy great memories whilst making new memories with family and friends. Kids and grandchildren are introduced to the older, soulful music.” Kenny said it is creating a connection between the old and the modern generations. On Saturdays, Kenny plays five songs from a particular year in his Time Tunnel feature and listeners have to guess which year it comes from. “The aim is to trigger memories when listeners talk about something significant in their lives,” said Kenny. “This makes radio more enjoyable because listeners are given the opportunity to interact with the music in a personal way.” He started his radio career 30 years ago as a teenager on Audwax Radio, a campus station where he played R&B, Soul, local and dance music. His nick name was Kick Ass Kenny. “At the time my love of music inspired me. It still does,” he said. After campus radio he joined Metro FM where he was known as Mafutha Jam. “Metro FM gave me the opportunity to become a household name,” said Kenny. Kenny is writing a book that will be published next year. “It is an inspirational book that speaks about my journey and my relationship with God,” he said.
