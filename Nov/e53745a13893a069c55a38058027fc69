Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Andile Jali has been ruled out for three to four weeks with a hamstring injury he picked up in the 0-0 draw against former club Orlando Pirates last Saturday. Jali had been returning to top form for Sundowns in recent times and was unfortunate to suffer the injury blow against the Sea Robbers in a APremiership clash. After making a barn-storming run across the length of the field to set up Jeremy Brockie for a good chance in the opening minutes, he sustained the muscle tear to his hamstring. As such, Brazilians coach Pitso Mosimane admitted it is a setback for his team. He told reporters: "That was a big one for us. "Eish, we lost a guy that always gave us box-to-box [movement] in the last three to four games. You could see even in the first two minutes, you could see where he was when he got the injury. "We lost a very good football player, but I think (Tiyani) Mabunda did exceptionally well when he came on. Honestly, I think it's three to four weeks and he doesn't need it when he is playing so well." In addition, he added that he hoped key central midfielders Mabunda and Hlompho Kekana wouldn't get injured on international duty for Bafana Bafana when they face Nigeria on Saturday in a crucial Africa Cup of Nations Group E qualifier. "Kekana is also going to the national team and anything can happen there with the national team. Mabunda is also there. You must understand that anything can happen there. "I don't have three central midfielders. You see how we lost 'Vila' [Sibusiso Vilakazi] with the injuries," he concluded.
