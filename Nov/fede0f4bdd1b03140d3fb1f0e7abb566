MZANSI was left shocked when the curtain closed on Idols contestant Basimane Moleto, better known as King B this past Sunday. He was always touted as a favourite, but that soon changed when was voted out of the competition. In an interview with Channel24, the flamboyant singer said he was expecting the outcome at some point. ““I honestly don’t feel sad. The dream had to start and this part of the journey had to happen in order for me to be able to go out there. Now the doors are open and I can go out there and do my thing.“At some point I did expect it to happen. I had to prepare myself from the moment I got into the competition. So, I’ve always been prepared,” he said. He said he got used to just performing every week, not thinking that it could all come crushing down if he lost focus. He said: “When we were in the top 10. That was the first time I was in the bottom two and it hit me that someone goes home. It really wasn’t in my mind until then, I just kept on thinking that I go on stage to perform and next week I sing again.“But that time it really hit me. So I had to prepare myself.” Well, with that kind of talent, we are certain doors will open for him. Mzansi hasn’t seen the last of him.
