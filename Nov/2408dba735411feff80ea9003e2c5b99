THE South African Communist Party in KZN has urged eThekwini Municipality to remove people who occupied RDP houses by force. James Nxumalo, chairman of the communist party, said he was told that people who were given houses by the municipality were forcibly removed by armed criminals. Nxumalo and ward 79 Councillor Sithenjwa Nyawose were part of the residents’ march against people who illegally occupied houses. The march took place in Umlazi, south of Durban on Sunday. Nxumalo said they spoke to the municipality and urged officials to act quickly and remove people who are occupying RDPs illegally. “We’d like to urge mayor Zandile Gumede to urgently intervene in this matter because things will get out of hand when people take the law into their hands. “We can’t allow a group of criminals to do as they wish,” said Nxumalo. Councillor Nyawose said he supported the march because he was one of the people who gave the houses to the right people. He urged the municipality to use police to remove illegal occupants. He said 37 houses were illegally occupied in the area. A resident said they were given houses last year but only occupied them for two weeks. Then a group of armed people kicked them out. “The group is known in the area. They have since sold the houses to other people,” said the woman. “After waiting for many years to get a house, I was disappointed to spend only two weeks in the structure. I was threatened with death after resisting going. “I had to leave the house for fear of my life. Now I live with my neighbours, even though I own a house in the area.”
