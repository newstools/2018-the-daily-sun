A 45-year-old man got the surprise of his life when a hungry python bit his 4-5 in a toilet The man went into his office bathroom in Bangkok, Thailand. As he was sitting down, the hungry python slid up, through the toilet and bit his 4-5. Following that he screamed in pain, and his colleagues found him wrestling with the python. According to Metro.co.uk he ripped off the snake, which had clinched its mouth around its penis. He then rushed into a car with blood pouring from his 4-5. The snake went back into the toilet bowl. Terdsak Kaewpangpan received 15 stitches in the tip of his penis and rescuers arrived to handle the python. The python had been living in the pipe work for a several works. I saw a snake in another toilet in the house two months ago so I was using this one instead. But I didn’t realise the toilets could be connected.’ Workers used the bathroom they felt was safe. However, they are both connected with the same plumbing. Terdsak added: ‘There are two bathrooms in the building and the snake had been seen before in one of the bathrooms. ‘We stopped using that toilet and thought it would be OK. This was a mistake as I didn’t realise they were connected. ‘Even in the morning my boss had joked ‘be careful of the snake’.
