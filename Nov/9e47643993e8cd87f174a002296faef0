ABANDONED rooms have left residents of Mandela Village near Kwamhlanga fearing for their lives as they have turned into a crime nest. Residents said the rooms have been left empty and unattended for many years and now contribute to crime and drugs. They said they have tried many times to locate the owner but without success and that the only solution now is to demolish them. A resident living close to the rooms, Sizakele Zulu (49) said the empty rooms were used for all sorts of sordid things. She said people from nearby taverns had sex there. “We don’t sleep well at night as we hear a lot of groaning and moaning coming from these abandoned rooms. “By day the rooms become a drug den as nyaope boys smoke in them,” she said. Another resident, Mkhuzelwa Mbonani (57), said they wanted the owner to do something about the rooms. “These rooms pose a serious danger to the community. All kinds of bad things are happening there. “The rooms should either be demolished or fixed and made safe for the sake of everyone who lives here. “The festive season is around the corner and thugs will have a field day. People will be robbed when coming from the nearby shopping complex. It threatens our safety and increases crime,” he said. Captain Nonhlanhla Kgosana said the community had the power to deal with the situation. She said people should join hands and meet the local chief to decide about the rooms. She said many wanted suspects had been found hiding there and that it affected the safety of the community. “There are many empty rooms in the area. Something must be done about these.”
