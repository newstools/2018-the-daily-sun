SALVATION bellowed from the speakers of the church in Observatory, Joburg. But soon loud voices were raised outside the church, too. This after cops stopped the church service and confiscated the sound system yesterday! Metro cops came to church in numbers – not to pray but after complaints by neighbours and residents about noise. Congregants watched helplessly as the church’s expensive speakers were loaded onto a police bakkie. Pastor Elisha Elijah claimed the cops targeted them because they were Nigerian. “Cops will invade our church and claim someone called them complaining about it,” he said. Elijah said if the church had belonged to South Africans, police wouldn’t have targeted them as much. “I don’t understand why they fight us. Anyone who’s fighting the church is fighting Christ. Cops are supposed to support churches, not fight them.” Public safety MMC Michael Sun said: “This church has been the cause of many complaints. “JMPD had to again impound sound equipment to stop the noise. We’re not against any place of worship, but lawlessness must be dealt with decisively. Enough is enough. We will be shutting this one down.”
