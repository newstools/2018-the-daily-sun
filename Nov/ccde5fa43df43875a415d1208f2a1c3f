A MANHUNT has been launched for three men who fled after shooting at cops on Friday. The trouble started when the police spotted a stolen Toyota Corolla and gave chase. The suspects fired shots at the police but luckily no one was injured. The police managed to catch three suspects while two, believed to be armed, escaped. Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock said the incident happened in Kuruman, Northern Cape, on Friday. “The Kuruman police task team arrested three men for being in possession of a hijacked vehicle. On Friday at about midnight, the men shot at the police after cops received a called from neighbourhood watch members about a suspicious car and gave chase,” he said. “The suspects abandoned the white Toyota Corolla and fled on foot into the veld next to the N14, just outside Kuruman. “Three of the five men were arrested. After further investigation, it was found that the car was hijacked in Pampierstad in July.”
