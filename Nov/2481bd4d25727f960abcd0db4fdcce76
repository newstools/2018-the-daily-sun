THE Retief Street taxi rank in Pietermaritzburg has become one of the most dangerous parts of the city. It is full of people who live on the street, many of whom are said to be whoonga addicts. After complaints from passengers, taxi drivers allegedly bought sjamboks and whipped the addicts, known as amaphara, until they left the taxi tank. They also burned their belongings before cops intervened. One of the whoonga addicts said without help from the police, they would have been in trouble. “We saw them having a meeting in a corner. Then they went to the shop and bought sjamboks. Some were even carrying bush knives,” said one addict. For most of Friday morning, trading was disrupted as shop owners and street vendors stopped selling, fearing for their safety. Santaco Umgungundlovu chairman Bheki Sokhela said he had not heard of the incident as he was out of town on Friday, but would look into it. He said they were aware of the problems at the taxi rank and had met cops and the municipality to help solve it. “Our main concern is the safety and welfare of commuters. The presence of people at the taxi rank who do not use taxis, are not trading, or going anywhere is concerning. We have seen how the public toilets at the rank have become unusable because of people who live there.” He said they hoped the Msunduzi Municipality would deal with the problem before it got out of hand as there was a high level of crime at the rank. “We do not want to be put in a position where we are forced to defend the place where we do our business,” he said. Police spokesman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident and said members of the public order police were sent to the scene. “A case of public violence was opened at Pietermaritzburg Police Station for investigation. No injuries were reported to the police.” Msunduzi municipal spokesman Ntobeko Ngcobo was not available for comment.
