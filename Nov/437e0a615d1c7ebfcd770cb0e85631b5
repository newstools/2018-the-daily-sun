COPS in Thabong, Free State, arrested a 22-year-old man on Tuesday for possession of illegal firearms and ammunition. The arrest followed a tip-off that a Lesotho man had illegal firearms stashed in his shack. The suspect was renting the shack at New Stands in Thabong kasi. Captain Malebo Khosana told Daily Sun: “When the officers arrived at the shack, cops found a 9mm Norinco pistol with six rounds of ammunition under a pillow.” Police also found a rifle. The guns were possibly used during house robberies and other crimes in the kasi. The suspect tried to flee but the cops cornered him. Thabong cluster commander Major-General Apaphia Modise congratulated the cops who made the arrest. “This valuable information is appreciated as it assisted us in reducing the number of firearms used to commit crimes against law-abiding citizens,” said Modise. Khosana said the suspect was charged with possession of illegal firearms and ammunition. He was due to appear in the Welkom Magistrates Court this week.
