THE DEPARTMENT OF International Relations and Cooperation
(DIRCO) has confirmed that the two Mzansi journalists who were detained in
Tanzania have been released. The Mail & Guardian editor Angela Quintal and her
colleague Muthoki Mumo were released by Tanzanian authorities around 4am on
Thursday. This after they were held by Tanzanian authorities. In a post on her Facebook page, Quintal said: “SOS we are
being taken away for interrogation in Dar. We don’t know why. Taken Away from
Southern Sun Hotel.” The she later tweeted before 1am on Tuesday morning that
she and her colleague had been released, but Quintal’s family raised concerns
that the tweet did not sound as if it had come from Quintal whose Twitter
account was subsequently suspended. @DIRCO tweeted that "SA journalist, Angela Quintal
& colleague are back in their hotel. SA’s High Commissioner Mr Thami
Mseleku is meeting with them to discuss last night’s events. He will then
engage Tanzanian authorities. @DIRCO_ZA spokesperson, Mr Ndivhuwo Mabaya spoke
to Ms Quintal this morning.”
