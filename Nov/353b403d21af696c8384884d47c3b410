AT 21 years of age, she already had 100 sexual partners
and she stopped counting after that. We often hear about threesomes, but this woman wants to
go way beyond that. If all her plans succeed, she will have 1000 butt naked
people in one room – having sex. The Polyamorous events planner revealed her ambition to
smash record for world’s largest ORGY … by having 1,000 people at marathon sex
party. THE SUN reports that Pearl Derrier's partners, Dan
Patrick, and ‘homemaker’ girlfriend Tomi Tailey, are also happy for her to get
involved. Pearl Derrier, 29, from Denver, Colorado, goes to orgies
at least once a month as one person can't fulfil her "every physical and
emotional need". Her partners, boyfriend Dan Patrick, 35, and "homemaker"
girlfriend Tomi Tailey, 30, are also happy for her to have casual liaisons with
other people at orgies. She hopes her sexual extravaganza will create a "sex
positive revolution" so attitudes will change towards orgies. Pearl said: "I’m not sure what will happen, but I
just know I want to be part of something I consider historically monumental to
the sex positive community. She first discovered her love for orgies and
non-monogamous relationships when she was working as a burlesque dancer in
2012. She told The Sun: “The moment I walked in, I saw someone
involved in an intimate act and was caught off guard a bit, but I soon realised
it was just like any other party, with people chatting and dancing, too. “People could have sex and be intimate, or just watch if
they wanted to."
