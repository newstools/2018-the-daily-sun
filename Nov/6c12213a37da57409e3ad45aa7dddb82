AS A heatwave held the central parts of the country in its grip, residents of Clocolan outside Ficksburg had to go for five days without water. Resident Kafi Falla (50) said: “It seems the municipality does not care about us. “We reported the matter to them on Friday, but no municipal officials were available. I was told they were all at a cherry festival 30km from our kasi. “I had to stay away from work to avoid heat stroke.” Mapaseka Mofokeng (40) said: “I have a four-month-old baby and I need clean water to make her formula milk. “I use towels as nappies, and I can’t wash these in dirty dam water because my baby might develop a rash. Livestock drink from the same dam we collect water from,” she said. Setsoto Municipality spokeswoman Moroesi Gaba said the shortages started when the pumps at the local treatment plant were burnt. She said the municipality fixed the problem. “Some areas have already received water. Once reservoir levels pick up, Clocolan will receive water,” she said. “Trucks were sent to deliver water to the residents during the disruption.”
