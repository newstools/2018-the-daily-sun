PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will grace this year’s Old Mutual Soweto Marathon as part of his Thuma Mina campaign which encourages healthy living for South Africans. Ramaphosa will take part in 10km race alongside professional athletes competing in the 42,2km and 21,1km events on Sunday. A field of about 30 000 runners are expected to line up on the day, with all three races starting and ending at FNB Stadium. The gruelling marathon, which pays a satisfactory R250 000 for the first man and woman home, will start at 6am, followed by the half marathon 30 minutes later, while casual runners will hit the streets at 7am. Ntsindiso Mphakathi, who runs in the colours of Nedbank, carries Mzansi’s hopes of keeping the men’s gold medal at home this time, while last year’s women’s race winner Irvette van Zyl is dreaming of back-to-back victories. Sintayeho Legese of Ethiopia completed a hat-trick of victories between 2014 and 2016, and he is back hoping to go one better than last year when he secured second place. He played second fiddle to Lesotho’s Tsepo Mathibele in 2017. Van Zyl says she is ready to make history, just five months after giving birth. She said: “It’s going to be a tough race, but I’m confident in my own ability. I will give it my all and see where I finish at the end of the race. It’s one of the toughest races I have ever run, I know the challenge that awaits me.” Soweto Marathon Trust chairman Sello Khunou expressed excitement about Ramaphosa’s involvement. “The president is equally excited about running in this famous race. His participation will boost its popularity. We urge runners to arrive early so they can get to their starting places on time.”
