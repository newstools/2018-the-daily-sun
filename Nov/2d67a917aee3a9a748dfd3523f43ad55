A video of a man being knocked over by a bus, is doing the
rounds on social media. In the video, the man called Smanga can be seen in a cheerful
mood, announcing to his friends that he is going live. While he was announcing that he’s going live, he sees a bus and
gets super excited while walking onto the middle of the road. As the bus turns into the intersection, it knocks him down
and the friends try to pick him up asking if he’s not hurt. It is not  where the clear when and where the incident happened.
