LUC Eymael has resigned as Free State Stars coach with immediate effect on Monday afternoon. Confirming his resignation on Monday, Eymael said it is best for both parties to part ways while they are still in good terms. "They (management) were not happy with the results, and I was also not happy with some things," Eymael tells SunSport without elaborating further. In his Twitter page, Eymael said: We separated on mutual agreement. Thanks to the committee, staff and players whom I have worked with for over a year. We had the biggest achievements together. Happy to have worked with you guys." When asked if he going to Black Leopards, who fired their coach Joel Masutha on Monday morning, Eymael responded: "Did Leopards fire their coach?" It has been rumoured that Eymael has been in talks with Leopards behind closed doors, but no one could have guessed when the whole exchange of positions will unfold. He told SunSport that he has had offers from Al Hilal of Soudi Arabian and many clubs locally and in Belgium too. Stars have not won in their last three matches and Eymael dumps the Free Staters on the eve of their Caf Confederation Cup clash match against Makura VictorySports on 28 November. They are ninth on the PSL log with 13 points from 14 matches.
