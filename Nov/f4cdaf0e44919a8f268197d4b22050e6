Bafana Bafana head coach Stuart Baxter has named a 23-man squad to take on Nigeria in a crucial Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier. Bafana Bafana welcome the high flying Super Eagles on Saturday 17 November 2018 at FNB Stadium (3pm). Baxter’s charges will be eying victory over in form Nigeria to ease the pressure that was built by their disappointing draw away against minnows Seychelles. Bafana currently sit second in Group E with 8 points, one point behind the Super Eagles who are on 9 points. South Africa will be buoyed by their unbeaten run so far in the qualifiers, as well as the fact that they were able to beat Nigeria away in UYO last year. Bafana will be without a number of key players as injuries are proving a nightmare for Baxter. Kamohelo Mokotjo, Dean Furman, Bongani Zungu, Keagan Dolly, Sibusiso Vilakazi and Bradley Grobler are all out with injuries. Thulani Serero will make his comeback to the National team setup after somewhat of a hiatus.
