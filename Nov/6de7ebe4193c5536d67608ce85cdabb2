THREE suspects were arrested for their alleged
involvement in a case of R78 Million fraud. The three suspects from KwaZulu Natal are alleged to
have conspired in 2014 and defrauded a deceased’s estate which was due to her
employee. “The deceased was an elderly lady from Germany who
was residing with her employee in her Durban North home. She nominated him as the sole beneficiary in her
will,” police spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said. Mhlongo said after she passed on, the employee went to their
neighbour to seek assistance and advice on the administration and winding up
the affairs of the deceased. “The neighbours allegedly gave him a few thousand
rands and allegedly requested him to go back to his smallholding whilst they
start with the process on his behalf. Upon his return he noticed that the three had
allegedly altered the deceased signature on the will, putting themselves as
beneficiaries,” Mhlongo added. It is alleged relatives of the deceased came to
know about the death of the deceased and that her estate was allegedly stolen. A case of fraud was opened at Durban North Police
Station the same year. In 2016, the case was transferred to the Hawks
Serious Commercial Crime Investigation for further investigation. Last week Thursday the Hawks investigations
culminated in the arrest of the three suspects and they immediately appeared at
the Durban Specialised Commercial Court.
