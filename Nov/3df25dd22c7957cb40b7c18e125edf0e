RESIDENTS of Mnquma, Eastern Cape have been without water for the past three weeks. Resident Thobisa Balani (24) said life was hard. “We thought the shortage was caused by the drought, but a municipal employee said workers are striking. “Now we hire trucks to fetch water from Gcuwa Dam. The water we use isn’t purified, but we don’t have a choice. “Those who can’t afford to hire trucks are suffering a lot because they have to travel long distances to fill their buckets with water. “We want the government to answer these workers because we are the ones who are suffering. Shop owner Mohammad Sheik said the strike was bad for business. “I no longer sell fat cakes because I need a lot of water to make them,” he said. Luzuko Yalezo, provincial deputy secretary of the South African Municipal Workers Union, said workers distanced themselves from the water shortage in Mnquma. “We heard that workers are no longer going to their plants. They told us that they stopped working because they hadn’t received protective clothing. They said they had been asking for the clothes for years,” said Yalezo. Amathole municipal spokeswoman Noni Madikizela-Vuso said there were back-up plans in place to provide water. “But the strike is delaying these plans. “The municipality is approaching the courts for assistance,” she said. “Numerous meetings have been held with the workers, not only to reach an agreement on their demands, but to point out that they are taking part in an illegal strike that’s impacting service delivery in the area.”
