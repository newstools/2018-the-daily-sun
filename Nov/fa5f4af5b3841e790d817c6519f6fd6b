Premier Soccer League have announced general tickets for the Telkom Knockout Soweto derby semifinal between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates at Moses Mabhida Stadium have sold out inside just two hours from going on sale. Tickets for this season's only other Soweto derby - at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on 27 October, were sold out eight days before the game, but took five days to sell out. The second Soweto Derby of the season will take place at Durban's Moses Mabhida Stadium on 24 November, (3pm).Â The fixture was moved from its traditional home, FNB Stadium, due to a prior event booking by Stadium Management. TKO reigning champions Bidvest Wits will visit Baroka at Peter Mokaba Stadium for the second semi-final 24 hours later. In the firs Soweto derby league match that was played at FNB Stadium last month, Pirates defeated Chiefs 2-1.
