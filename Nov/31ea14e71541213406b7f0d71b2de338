The Daily Show host, Trevor Noah has postponed several stand-up comedy shows in The United States because of illness. Trevor posted a screengrab of a note on his social media platforms on Friday explaining that what he had thought was only a mildly sore throat was actually bruised vocal chords and that three of his shows had to be rescheduled so that he could recover. The postponed shows were due to take place in Milwaukee, Illinois and Connecticut.
