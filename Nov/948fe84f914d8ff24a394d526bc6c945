THESE cops have big hearts. On Friday, cops from various police stations around Cape Town donated clothes to Town Two fire victims in Khayelitsha. Major-General Mzwandile Mzamane said: “These are our people and that’s why we decided to help. “We know that some victims had already bought Christmas things when the fire broke out last month.” He urged the residents to work with cops because they were there to protect them. “People must know that we’re not only about arresting criminals, but we also love our communities and are not isolated to the troubles they go through,” he said. Mzamane said he was grateful to other communities that donated the clothes. Community leader Malanga Mkhatshwa (48) said: “We’re grateful to the police for helping Town Two fire victims. “We never thought they would have time to visit the victims because they’re always busy chasing criminals.” Fire victim Lusapho Tshofela (56) was happy with the donation. “We’re not stressing about Christmas because the police and other communities have shown us love. “We’re also grateful to Metro Food Town Hyper for the R500 food voucher given to each fire victim in Town Two,” Lusapho told Daily Sun.
