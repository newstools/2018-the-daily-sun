THE South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has urged
social grant beneficiaries to urgently swap their old cards for the new one. SASSA says if beneficiaries don’t get the new gold card,
they run the risk of not getting their grants in January 2019. It says it’s concerned that some beneficiaries are still
holding on to the old cards, which have reached their expiry date. “The danger of holding on to the old card is that affected
beneficiaries risk losing their benefits. We also wish to warn beneficiaries that soon we will no
longer make any social grant payments into these old cards. For this reason, affected beneficiaries have to visit the
nearest SASSA or post office to do a card swap,” SASSA Acting CEO Abraham
Mahlangu said. Mahlangu said individual letters have also been sent to
beneficiaries as part of government's mass communication campaign. “November is the deadline for obtaining the new SASSA cards
and unfortunately there will be no extension.” According to SASSA, just over half a million out of about
10.9 million beneficiaries are still in possession of the old SASSA cards.
