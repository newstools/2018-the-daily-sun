THIS abandoned building is a nightmare for residents of KwaMashu P section. They said the structure near the kasi shopping centre is a crime hot spot. Resident Nothando Mzolo (35) said three men robbed her of her money and groceries recently. “I didn’t report the case to the police. Many people have been robbed near that building, but nothing has been done about it,” she said. “Thugs hide in the building because they know they won’t be seen or caught.” Another resident, Mbuso Ngidi (45), said cops must regularly patrol near the building. “The route is also used by people going to KwaMashu Clinic. “They become easy targets for the thugs,” he said. Councillor Muzuwenhlanhla Shezi said he once asked young men in the kasi to use the building as a gym. “If they don’t use it any more, I’ll have to find other people who can use it,” he said. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane encouraged residents to report cases.
