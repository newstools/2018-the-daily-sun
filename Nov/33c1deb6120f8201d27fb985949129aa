SCHOOLS are reflections of their communities. And instead of using equipment such as golf clubs and hockey sticks for sport, in these schools such equipment is used as weapons. On Wednesday Randfontein cops, social crime and sector management and the local community policing forum, as well as the departments of education and co-operative governance and traditional affairs, conducted raids at local schools and those in surroundings kasis. One of the schools included was Ithuteng High School in Brandvlei kasi. Cops addressed issues such as gambling, gangsterism, substance abuse, drugs, possession of dangerous weapons and sexual offences. Randfontein police spokeswoman Constable Carmen Hendricks said they now regularly carried out raids at schools. “We often receive complaints from schools and residents about misbehaving pupils. “We conduct these raids to make sure teachers and other pupils are safe. “We have a weekly plan to hit these schools, but the plans differ from week to week,” she said. Afterwards, social crime sector managers, Cogta officials, CPF members, ward committee officers and patrollers held a road activation and door-to-door crime awareness campaign in Extension Five, Mohlakeng, on the West Rand. “The aim was to address sexual offences, housebreakings, car theft, human trafficking and other crime-related matters. “Cops interacted with the community, especially the youth, to promote safety.”
