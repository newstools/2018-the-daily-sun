A 38-year-old former police Sergeant will appear before
Motetema Magistrate's court outside Groblesdal on two counts of attempted
murder soon. The suspect has been arrested for attempting to murder
his girlfriend, who is a Social Worker and her twin sister in Mmotwaneng
village outside Marble Hall. Limpopo cops spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said
that according to the information received, the suspect went to his
girlfriend’s home and on arrival, broke the window of the room in which the
victims were sleeping and started stabbing his girlfriend. The twin sister was also stabbed when she apparently
attempted to come to the rescue of her sister. After this brutal attack, the
suspect disappeared and attempted to take his own life. The police, assisted by the K9 and the local community
members, launched a massive search operation until the suspect was on Tuesday
found hiding at his friend’s place at Mmotoaneng village. Mojapelo said the suspect was a police Sergeant attached
to Motetema police station and was dismissed from the service two months ago
after he was arrested for armed robbery that he committed in April 2018. The victims, aged 32 years, were taken to hospital for
medical treatment. The Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police
Service in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has condemned this attack
on the two women. “We are already seized with activities around the
province on 16 Days of Activism for no violence against women and children and
this type of criminality must be condemned in the strongest possible terms,”
said Ledwaba. The motive for this brutal attack is unknown at this
stage. Police investigations are continuing
