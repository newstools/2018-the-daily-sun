PROPHET Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng probably wasn’t expecting the lavish gift he got this week. Prophet Shepherd Bushiri gave Mboro a special gift for his 50th birthday. During a glamorous function held at Protea Hotel in Midrand, Gauteng, on Monday, Bushiri promised to contribute R1 million towards the #Mboro50 charity campaign. Bushiri made the donation on behalf of Enlightened Christian Gathering, the church he leads. He said Mboro deserved support to spread the gospel and uplift disadvantaged communities. Bishops, pastors, prophets and Midvaal mayor Bongani Baloyi attended the event. Baloyi said preachers played an important roles in communities. The mayor also praised Mboro for meeting people’s spiritual needs. Speakers described Mboro as an honest, forgiving and generous man. They applauded him for helping the needy despite the criticism he faced. The speakers warned Bushiri and Mboro not to allow people to come between their friendship. The two were previously reported to have been at war with each other before making peace. Bushiri said although he and Mboro had different approaches, they served the same God. He said they were misunderstood, called names and attacked because of their calling. Bushiri said: “We appreciate your achievements. “You have changed many lives. “I love you and my wife knows that.” He also urged preachers to support each other. An emotional Mboro said: “We are also human and we make mistakes, but some people exaggerate our shortcomings. “Out of all my brothers, you are the only one who has done this. “I’m used to giving instead of receiving. “Being a prophet is hard. “I’ve been rejected, threatened and arrested. “I was starting to think I was the dumbest man on the planet.”
