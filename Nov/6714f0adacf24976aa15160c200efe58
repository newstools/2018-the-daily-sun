ORPHANS from the Zanokhanyo Children’s Home in Makhasa, Cape Town lost everything when a fire swept through the orphanage. Manager Nolubabalo Ndita said the incident took place on Wednesday morning. “I think the people who started the fire are thugs who were stealing the clothes at the back of the orphanage. “They probably used matches to see where they were going,” she said. Orphan Sizwe Ncubela (18) said it would take some time for things to return to normal. “As you can see, we could not save anything,” he said. “Everything was burned and the only things we have left are the clothes we’re wearing.” He said they tried to put out the fire but failed. “Residents tried to help, but that did not make a difference. We watched as the fire destroyed everything we owned.” Sigcinele Mkraqa (17) said they had lost laptops and important documents. “We were lucky our IDs were not burned because they were in our wallets. “All of our other documents were destroyed, however,” said Sigcinele. Nolubabalo appealed to SunReaders to help in any way they could. “We know that most people do not have money, but the orphanage needs all the help it can get,” she said.
