COPS have been busy confiscating fake goods in the Joburg
CBD on Monday. A joint operation is between the JMPD, SAPS and Customs. They are trying to rid the city of counterfeit goods that
are sold on the streets. Last Thursday during a similar operation, foreign nationals
owning these shops attacked cops who were trying to remove confiscate fake
goods. But on Monday they stood no chance as the cops came out in
full force. One officer alleged that these buildings were raided almost
every week but each time they went back they found stores repacked with goods
worth millions.
