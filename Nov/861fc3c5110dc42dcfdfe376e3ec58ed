Home Affairs minister Malusi Gigaba has apologised for
making a gesture with his pinky finger at EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndloziin Parliament
on Tuesday. Ndlozi said showed Ramaphosa the phone and said:
"Honourable Presiden, you may want to start ordering it for Cabinet
members, because it will save us a lot from some of their embarrassing
activities. "It can't even be hacked this phone. Can I come
maybe give it to you, so you have a model of what phones might be critical for
honourable Cabinet members?" Gigaba responded by raising his pinky to Ndlozi. Mzansi people interpreted it to be an insult regarding
Ndlozi's penis size. On Wednesday morning Gigaba tweeted: "I apologise,
unreservedly, for this gesture. The petty taunts that provoked it and the
strain I have been taking, over the past 10 days, are no excuse for my
indiscretion."
