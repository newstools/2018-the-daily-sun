Former Generations: The Legacy actor Duma Mnqobi has launched his music career and fans are not impressed. According to fans on social media, the star’s song titled Umsindo, leaves a lot to be desired. Social media was abuzz as soon as Duma shared the video of the song on social media with fans making fun of his singing. Durban Gqom duo Distruction Boyz, who are no strangers to making hit songs, might just turn it into another festive jam. The Omunye hit-makers have toyed with the idea of remixing Duma’s song on social media. Zipho “Goldmax” Mthembu, one half of the group, said Duma should say the word and they would turn the song into another festive hit. “Duu! Song of the year, the ball is in Fana’s court, he must explain while it’s still early,” he wrote in Zulu. Whteher or not this collaboration will happen is still a mystery.
