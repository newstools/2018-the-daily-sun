MEMBERS of the Mkhabela family want answers. This after one of the family was allegedly killed by zama zamas on Sunday. The members of the family told Daily Sun that Andile Mkhabela (37), a former mineworker from Barberton in Mpumalanga, was taken from his home by eight men who wanted his help to gain access to the Sheba Mine. His body was found by security guards near the mine on Monday. A family member said: “We don’t understand what happened because when the men arrived here, they didn’t show any signs of violence. “We are hearing different stories and all we want is the truth so we can move on.” The family believes Andile was pushed from high up as he had bruises on his face, his bones were fractured and his spinal cord was broken. "We are still angry about what happened. Our brother was not even involved in illegal mining. He died for nothing,” said a family member. The Mkhabelas told the SunTeam they were scared to open a case with the police because they feared the zama zamas would attack them. Police spokesman Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said an inquest docket was opened. “We are waiting for the post mortem results,” he said.
