ZULU King Goodwill Zwelithini has defended hosting Diwali celebrations in his palace at the weekend and earlier inviting AfriForum to the annual reed dance. The king was speaking at the unveiling of his own and Nelson Mandela’s statues at Mitchell Park in Durban yesterday. The king lashed out at those who criticised him and said he was doing it for social cohesion between different race groups in the province. He said everyone was aware that the relationship between Indians and Zulus was not good, so he felt he should work towards uniting these groups. City Press’ Mondli Makhanya on Sunday criticised Zwelithini for associating himself with Ishwar Rumlutchman, who in 2013 was found guilty of tender rigging. He also questioned the king’s invitation to AfriForum for the reed dance. The king said journalists should be reminded of the importance of cultural diversity.
