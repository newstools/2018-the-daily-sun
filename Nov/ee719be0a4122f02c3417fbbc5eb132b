AFTER being humiliated at Jabba’s funeral on Saturday, Lerato Sengadi seems to have gone on the war path. Lerato was not recognised at her husband Jabulani “HHP” Tsambo’s funeral in Mahikeng, North West or mentioned in his obituary. Yesterday at 1am, Lerato allegedly went to Jabba’s home in Joburg and kicked out his helper, who had been working for him since 2004. This was confirmed by Tsambo family spokesman Nkululeko Ncana, who said the helper was left homeless. “Lerato came with the locksmith and the police. She broke all the locks and replaced them. Now even Jabba’s son has no access to the house,” he said. Nkululeko said the family felt what Lerato did was bad. Nkululeko said the helper’s child was practically Jabba’s as he was the guardian and paid her school fees. He said the family was looking into assisting the helper. On Friday the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg recognised Lerato as Jabba’s customary wife, but did not grant her an interdict to stop his funeral from taking place. She took Jabba’s dad Robert to court after he allegedly denied she was their makoti, denied her entry to Jabba’s home and withheld his identity documents. The court gave her access to Jabba’s house in Randpark Ridge, Joburg. Nkululeko told the SunTeam the Tsambo family was in the process of appealing against the judgment. “We feel the judge did not adequately apply his mind,” he said. When the SunTeam called Lerato for comment, another woman who did not identify herself picked up. She said Lerato was in the shower and would be available in an hour, but further attempts to reach her were unsuccessful.
