Polokwane City coach Josef Vukusic and captain fantastic Jabulani Maluleke have won the Absa Premiership coach and player of the month awards for October. City matched their longest unbeaten record of eight matches in all competitions prior to losing 2-1 to Orlando Pirates in the league at Peter Mokaba Stadium last night. Rise and Shine beat Kaizer Chiefs and Maritzburg United, and drew with SuperSport United in the Absa Premiership last month, but were knocked out of the Telkom Knockout last-16 on penalties by Matsatsantsa. Veteran playmaker Maluleke was recognised for his efforts, which included providing assists against SuperSport and Maritzburg.
