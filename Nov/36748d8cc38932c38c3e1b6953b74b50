IT is no secret that rapper Emtee is not the biggest fan of Cassper Nyovest. If that was not clear enough before, the Instagram live video that surfaced on Twitter on Thursday certainly confirms it. In the video Emtee dissed Cassper’s music and his lack of responsibilities.

Someone please ask Emtee if he’s coming to Mabhida doe. We need him out to come entertain us! I’ll pay the full fee!” he tweeted. “That Emtee video sh*tting on me really made my day. Hahaha. I would pay real money to see Emtee at Mabhida on the 1st of December but I don’t want him to perform, I just want him to just talk. It’ll be like a comedy set,” Cassper added. Lmao....
