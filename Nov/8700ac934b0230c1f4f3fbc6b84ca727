YESTERDAY, Gauteng Premier David Makhura announced the transfer of land from Mpumalanga to Gauteng. Makhura said 21 portions of land would be allocated. He said only 18 portions had been transferred at this stage. The title deeds were received in May. Ekangala was previously part of the KwaNdebele homeland. After 1994 the land was transferred to Mpumalanga. But after the municipal elections in 2011, the Metsweding Municipality was absorbed into the City of Tshwane. Makhura said: “Due to the complexity of the area, all assets were transferred from Mpumalanga, including the land.” The process was concluded in April. “Gauteng could not use any of the land until a transfer process was finalised,” said Makhura. In 2016, then Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza concluded the transfer process by signing certificates of registration for the asset transfer. “Last year, the documents were lodged through the office of the state attorney at the deeds office to ensure the names on the title deeds reflected the Gauteng province,” said Makhura. “Gauteng is currently working on finalising the title deeds process of the remaining three portions of land.”
