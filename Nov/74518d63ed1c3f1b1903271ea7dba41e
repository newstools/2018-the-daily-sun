Fitness bunny Sbahle Mpisane seems to be well on her way to full recovery. Recent Pictures of Sbahle are making rounds on social media as she is smiling and looks well on her way to recovery from her horrific car accident months ago. Mpisane was last seen on social media and the media after her brother posted a video of her wishing her parents a happy wedding anniversary from her hospital bed. In the video Sbahle appeared to have made huge progress as she can be seen sitting up and speaking quite comfortably. “Hey guys, today is the 11 of September, it’s my parents’ anniversary and we’re very excited,” she says in the video posted by his younger brother Andile Mpisane on his Instagram account. The video was since taken down after it got major backlash from the people.
