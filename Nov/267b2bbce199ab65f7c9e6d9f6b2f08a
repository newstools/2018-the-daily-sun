Miss Curvybody SA top 20 contestants have taken the lead to promote fitness and healthy living. They organised fun runs/walks and a picnic at Fountain Valley in Pretoria and at the Orient Theatre in East London, Eastern Cape, last Saturday. The events were to raise awareness on body shaming and to say no to bullying. Participants in Pretoria had a fabulous workout session with fitness coach Mamo Maloka. Mamo said the pageant focused on beauty, wellness and health. “The aim of the pageant is to empower and develop the youth and women,” she said. CEO Mapule Mphaki said: “We refuse to conform. We say no to body shaming and bullying. Body shaming can result in serious psychological effects. “As a pageant that’s aimed at empowering curvaceous women, we have a responsibility to encourage people of all sizes to become physically active.” Karabo Seleke from Tshwane said people always made fun of her body. “Whenever I go out, people especially men, make comments. “Some of the comments are so deep I sometimes feel naked. “I mostly prefer to be home with my children and around people who have accepted who I am.” Nomthandazo Nkosi from East London said it hurt her feelings when people called her names. “I’m called names such as Pakistan, Mapakisha and Mepako. “My body is my body and people must respect me this way.”
