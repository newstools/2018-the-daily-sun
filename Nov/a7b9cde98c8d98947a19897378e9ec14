Our favourite queen of the dance floor Zodwa Wabantu still turns heads when she rocks up in one of her trademark revealing outfits. She has been at it for a few years now and it seems like she is not about to lose her touch anytime soon. The sultry entertainer recently showed up at an event wearing a laced dress with her entire back side exposed. This time, however, she was wearing underwear which barely hid her private parts. As always, all eyes were on Zodwa as she made her grand entrance. Zodwa continues to split opinion with her outfits. “Zodwa you're killing it,” one of her fans commented. “I can't believe walking naked in public is now celebrated. Women we have really lowered our standard mmm the world is coming to an end really,” another one said. Check out the pictures below: Only Zodwa Wabantu,I don't Sleep.
