THE quality of service at Taylor Bequest Hospital in Matatiele is likely to improve in leaps and bounds now that six more doctors have been hired. CEO Ntombombuso Sejosengoe said the community had been complaining about the hospital’s service for the past five years. “The hospital is now operating with 10 doctors and two clinical associates,” she said. “We’re happy to welcome our new colleagues from different countries. “The community of Matatiele and its surrounding areas will experience shorter queues and waiting times,” she said. “The hospital in each ward but we’re happy to announce that all wards now have two doctors to serve them. “We’re also pleased the waiting period for patients has improved.” EFF regional secretary Simthembile Madikizela praised the move. Earlier this year, members of the EFF marched to several hospital in Alfred Nzo, including Taylor Bequest. They demanded better healthcare services, adequate training of hospital staff and the appointment of more doctors. “We’re pleased with the recent appointment. “The timing is good and we appreciate that some of our demands were taken into consideration,” he said. Earlier this year, Matatiele mayor Momelezi Mbedla noted the challenges faced by the hospital. He said he understood the people’s frustrations. “It’s not that the hospital doesn’t employ doctors. They just don’t stay for very long,” he said. Municipal spokeswoman Olwethu Gwanya said: “We believe the appointments are an effective way to address community members’ healthcare issues. “We hope the doctors will stick around and honour their contracts.”
