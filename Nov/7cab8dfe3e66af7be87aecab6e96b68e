Local Hip-Hop DJ and producer, Ms Cosmo has been booked perform at two different festivals in Dubai next week. The Ay Baby hit-maker will take to the 1s and 2s at the One Africa Music Festival as well as at the Afrobeats in Dubai festival. The One Africa Music Festival brings together Africa’s best and brightest talents, with the sole aim of solidifying Africa’s position within the entertainment industry on a global level. It is a platform that showcases and promotes the understanding of Africa's uniqueness to the world through music and other forms of art such as visual art. According to the organisers of the festival, they hope that the festival will inspire people to appreciate how Africa's legacy directly relates to their lives while building a cultural awareness that deepens their connection to the global community. Meanwhile, the Afrobeats in Dubai festival will also celebrate African music and the talent that keeps it alive. Ms Cosmo will perform at One Africa Fest on 15 November and then head to the music beach festival Afrobeats in Dubai from 16 November – 18 November 2018. The 5FM DJ is no stranger to performing to foreign audiences, having played in America and the UK in 2018. She is currently on the promotional trail in a bid to scoop the Favourite DJ award at the 2nd annual DSTV Mzansi Viewers Choice Awards.
