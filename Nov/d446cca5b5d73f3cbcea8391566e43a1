countdown is on to the historic clash between English Premier League side
Everton and Kenyan SportPesa Premier League Champions Gor Mahia. The two
sides will contest the SportPesa Trophy, with Gor Mahia making history as the
first African side to play against Premier League opposition in the UK. Gor Mahia
Football Club, commonly also known as K'Ogalo, is a football club based in
Nairobi, Kenya. They have won the Kenyan SportPesa Premier League a record 17
times, four more than their arch-rivals A.F.C. Leopards, and have also won the
FKF President's Cup a record 10 times. Gor Mahia
coach Dylan Kerr said: “I was really excited when we won the SportPesa Super
Cup and qualified to play Everton. It’s a huge opportunity for the players to
test their skills against European opposition and showcase what they can do. It’s not every day that you get the chance to face a (English) Premier League
team and we’re going to make it count on November 6.” Kelvin
Twissa, Chief Marketing Officer at SportPesa said: “SportPesa is passionate
about football and taking every opportunity, and there’s no bigger opportunity
for Gor Mahia than facing English Premier League heavyweights, Everton. Playing
in England will help the players improve and they will no doubt be able to take
their experience back to Kenya which will help grow the game there.” The Kenyan
side secured a showdown with the Blues after they defeated Tanzania’s Simba SC
in the SportPesa Super Cup final in June. It will be
the second clash between the sides, after Everton defeated Gor Mahia 2 – 1 in
Tanzania in July 2017. While in
Tanzania the Blues, alongside SportPesa, won hearts and minds in the region
when they participated in a range of promotional and charitable activities
across Dar es Salaam. -ENDS- About
