WE ALL know shoppers use opportunities such as Black Friday to spend money while thinking they are saving. But the truth is that buying on sale is financially dangerous if credit is used. DebtSafe’s safe shopping tips , Spending lid: Don’t shop ‘til-you-drop. Make sure you have a budget for your Black Friday buys. Know how much you can spend before you start and when you must stop. , Make informed decisions: First of all, it is important to decide if you want to take on the stressful noise, crowds and queues or if you’d rather shop online. , Research beforehand: To use Black Friday successfully, locate the specials you want and put them on a list with the maximum you are willing to spend on each item. , “Sale-proof” before you buy: Make sure that what you want to buy is indeed offered at a reduced price. Also ask yourself: Is Black Friday providing better savings than what’s available throughout the year?” , Safety first: If you have to stand in queues, remember this: a small handbag helps you to keep your personal belongings a bit closer to foil pickpockets. If you are driving to the shops, park your car in a secure spot, be aware of your surroundings and don’t buy more than you can carry – otherwise you may be an easy victim of theft. If you are going to shop online instead also be aware of distributing your personal information and account details. Make sure that the sites you use are secure and trustworthy to avoid identity theft. , Oops – beware of debt hangovers: Be honest with yourself – do you want more debt in your future? Take a look at your current financial situation – do you have a major debt problem? It is always a better idea to see your banker or financial planner and get your finances looking better again.
