IT SEEMS Vusi Nova’s song Asiphelelanga is bringing him more trouble than joy, even though it’s trending. First, it was maskandi fans who forced him to record a remix and include maskandi singers who have since died. Now a PSL team boss has accused him of being a thief. Chippa United has claimed Vusi stole the club’s song, Asiphelelanga. Club chairman Siviwe Mpengesi said their fans recorded the song in 2013, and it has become their anthem. “This is our song. It belongs to the club and our supporters. Vusi can’t claim it as his,” said Siviwe. He said they’ve consulted their lawyers, who were expected to come back to them next week with a court date. “We’re taking action against Vusi because he’s making money out of our song.” Vusi said: “What is wrong with people? This song is public domain, it has been sung by politicians and residents when they’re toyi toying. “Now I’ve made it big and people are starting to claim it as theirs! “Anyone who is black and grew up in the kasi knows the song. It is an old song. I didn’t steal it. Chippa can go to court and claim something that is not theirs. The club’s jealousy will make this song even bigger,” said Vusi.
