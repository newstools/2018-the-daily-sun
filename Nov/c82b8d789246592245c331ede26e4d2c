A new gel that has to be applied daily in order to stop sperm production is on trial. The gel is meant to stop sperm production, while maintaining testosterone level. This gel has been in the making for than a decade, and only now has it entered clinical trials. The gel reportedly contains testosterone and a progestin, which is a synthetic form of the female sex hormone progesterone. The gel has to be applied on the arms and shoulders every day, works to shut down the gonadotropin hormones responsible for stimulating testosterone production in the testes. According to Diana Blithe, chief of the contraceptive development program, since sperm production is dependent on very high testosterone levels in the testes (much higher than the testosterone levels in the blood), shutting the gonadotropins lowers sperm production. But there’s a catch - when you lower the testosterone in the testes, testosterone levels in the blood also drop and that can lead to nasty side effects like low libido or problems with ejaculation. The Vox.com reported that that’s why the gel contains some replacement testosterone, “to keep everything functioning but not start sperm production again.” In a 24-week study, published in 2012 and funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the gel suppressed sperm levels in nearly 90 percent of men to 1 million per milliliter or less — the amount needed to prevent pregnancy with few side effects. Now a major, multicenter trial, involving 420 couples in the US, UK, Chile, Sweden, Kenya, and Italy is underway.
