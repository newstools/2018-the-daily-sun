PUPILS were very grateful when student Ofentse Vinger donated sanitary pads on Tuesday. The Central University of Technology accounting student said he visited Vulamasango High School in Phahameng kasi, Mangaung, as part of a project he started last year. The 22-year-old from Rocklands said he had already donated sanitary pads to seven schools in the Motheo district. “I decided to use money I had saved for myself to buy the pads. I also go to different shops for donations. After collecting them, I distribute them to the girls identified by their teachers,” he said. “Having realised that most of these girls come from poor backgrounds, I told myself I would do something to help them. I also do motivational talks to encourage them to focus on their education as it’s their only tool to fight poverty. “Education helps you turn your family around. It can take you out of slavery to freedom and a better future. “I aim to expand this project but my challenge is I’m using public transport to deliver the products and I need more funding. I’m asking a Good Samaritan to help me reach more schools,” Ofentse said. “My main focus is farm schools as I’ve realised they need help the most.” Grade 9 pupil Mpho Setai (15) was pleased to receive the pads as they will boost her confidence during her period. “I live with my guardians who are pensioners and struggle to afford them.” Vulamasango teacher Cecily Mochochoko said the donation came at the right time. “The pads lessen the challenges at our school. Some pupils come from poor families and it will make them feel confident in class and help them to attend school regularly.”
