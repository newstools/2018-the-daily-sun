Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Wiseman Meyiwa is in a stable condition in hospital after he was involved in a car accident on Saturday afternoon. The 18 year-old was on his way home to Pietermaritzburg when the accident took place on the N3 highway, near Villiers in the Free State. His club Kaizer Chiefs announced the news on social media. “The player was rushed to hospital and taken to intensive care unit for monitoring,” they said, “he is stable, and doctors are still assessing the seriousness of his injuries. “An update will be shared once more details are available.” Meyiwa is the second Chiefs player to be involved in an accident in recent weeks after Lebogang Manyama survived a horror accident on the N1 north after the Malibongwe Interchange in Johannesburg. Meyiwa is now expected to face a spell on the sidelines.
