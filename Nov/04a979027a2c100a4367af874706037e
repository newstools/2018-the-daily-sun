Rap superstar, Kwesta and the special lady in his life, Yolanda Mvelase are celebrating the eighth year of their baeship. The couple have been together since 2010 and their union has beat the odds. Where most celebrity relationship are put to the ultimate test by the prying eyes of the media and fans, Kwesta and Yolanda have somehow managed to not only maintain a certain level of privacy, but to keep things going. Their relationship has even stood the test of time against female fans throwing themselves at Kwesta. They both took to their social media pages to celebrate the special day. “Happy 8th year anniversary to us my everything,” Yolanda said. Yesterday, the couple sent the whole night on the set of Kwesta’s Vur Vai music video, which wrapped after 6am. It looks like the secret to a long-lasting relationship, especially in the entertainment industry is unconditional support, self-assurance and trust. We can’t wait for the couple to tie the knot. 8 years vandag?
