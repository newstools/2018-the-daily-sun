BAFEDI Masoko wants justice for her murdered husband. Tomorrow, the man accused of murdering her husband, Petrus (68), will again appear in the Mogwase Magistrates Court. The suspect is accused of killing Petrus on his farm in Kameelkuil, outside Rustenburg in North West at the end of August. He was spending the night alone at the farm when he was attacked. Police believe the suspect didn’t act alone. The 68-year-old widow told Daily Sun: “My husband never spent a night away without calling me. If he failed to call at night, he did it first thing in the morning. “I got worried when 8am passed and he had not called. I called him but his phone rang unanswered. I called other farmers and relatives to go check on him. They found the gate locked.” Later, a boy who was supposed to go out with Petrus that morning decided to go into the house and found splashes of blood on the wall. Someone broke open the door and found Petrus’ body next to the bed, covered in bloody blankets. His van was found in Ventersdorp last month in the possession of a man who lived near the farm. The man was first arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle and then a murder charge was added.
