South Gauteng High Court Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng has ruled that Lerato Sengadi is the lawful customary wife of Jabba. But the Judge has denied Sengadi's interdict, to stop the funeral from taking place in the North West. Hip Hop Pantsula’s customary wife Lerato went to the South Gauteng High Court to stop Jabba’s funeral. The Tsambo family says Sengadi is welcomed to attend the funeral, even though she wanted to halt the funeral. Hip Hop producer was seen at the High Court Amu allegedly to give support Sengadi. The rapper/producer says he knows what Jabba’s wishes were. Daily Sun reported earlier that in court papers, Jabba’s father, Robert Tsambo, had previously stated to the media that they do not recognise Lerato as their makoti. He also refused to tell her where Jabba’s body was and refused to hand over documents, his death certificate or ID to her. Lerato also revealed that she only knew that the Tsambo family had scheduled the funeral and burial in North West for this Saturday because of social media. Sengadi alleges that Jabba told her he wanted to be buried in Johannesburg at WestPark Cemetery. According to her, Jabba wanted to be buried at WestPark in order for his son to be able to visit his grave.
