WHEN the pastor was accused of having affairs with girls from his church two years ago, he denied everything. But it seems the pastor (35) from a church in Richmond Farm, Durban has a lot of explaining to do. The pastor is behind bars after he was charged with four counts of rape. He was arrested on Friday and is expected to appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court today. It is alleged the pastor had been targeting young girls raised by single parents. Daily Sun reported in 2016 that 10 girls revealed he had affairs with them. On Thursday three girls reported him to the cops. Upon hearing about the rape allegations, angry residents laid waste to his church. A resident said one of the girls told her the pastor had been having affairs for the past two years. “Three other girls also came to me and my husband. “We took them to their parents to tell them what was happening,” she said. “The parents were shocked as they had trusted the pastor. “They allowed us to take the girls to the police station, where cases were opened.” The woman said more girls will come forward. “The residents are angry. We did not tell them to destroy the church. “He is running after young girls and destroying them even though he is married. Another resident said this was not the first time this pastor was accused of being a predator. “We destroyed his church because we want him to leave this area,” he said. KZN police spokeswoman Thembeka Mbele confirmed that a 35-year-old pastor had been arrested and that he had been charged with four counts of rape.
