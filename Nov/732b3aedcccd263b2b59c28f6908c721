A PROMISE made is at last a promise kept! After scores of cash-in-transit robberies in Gauteng and other provinces, Police Minister Bheki Cele vowed to make arrests – and last Tuesday he said 237 suspects had been bust since April. Yesterday cash management company SBV Services praised the minister for a job well done. The company said Cele and the police had made headway in the ongoing battle against heists. It said cops’ perseverance resulted in a 36% drop in such crime compared to a year ago. It was happy to see police prioritising the crime and working to keep vulnerable victims and innocent bystanders safe. “SBV Services is committed to supporting the police and all stakeholders . . . to help make the transport of money safer.” CEO Mark Barrett commended the risk and compliance team. “We work tirelessly with police to apprehend criminals involved in these attacks. No case is closed until the criminals involved are brought to book,” he said. Barrett expressed gratitude to shareholding banks and their boards.
