RESIDENTS from New Mandela in Zwelethemba, Worcester use plastic bags to relieve themselves because they don’t have toilets. Lindile Kamteni (38) told Daily Sun: “It’s a shame when you have to take that plastic bag outside. It is not healthy for us and our families.” The residents protested over lack of services on 5 October. “Our municipality doesn’t care about us. We have been without toilets for too long and we were hoping we would have toilets by now,” said Lindile. Phumzile Dlikilili (58) is an unhappy man because residents are dumping their plastic bags of kak next to his house. “I know they can’t keep these plastic bags in their homes but they need to find another place to dump them because the smell comes straight into my house,” he said. “Our municipality has promised us toilets. I don’t know why it’s so hard to keep that promise,” said Phumzile. The residents said there is no development in their area. “The truth is no one cares if we use plastics bags or not. The municipality just doesn’t care,” said Yoliswa Khayeni. She said the only option they had was to protest. “It is clear that if you are complaining without protesting, no one listens,” said Khayeli. Breede Valley municipal spokeman Neil Mercuur said after proper assessment, the municipality found that there was an additional need for toilet services. “This was created mostly by the recent invasion of private land,” said Mercuur. He said the matter should be resolved within two weeks.
