THREE doctors stared death in the face yesterday. . . but they survived! It is alleged five heavily armed suspects got into the doctors’ living quarters at the Letaba Hospital outside Tzaneen, Limpopo at about 3am. Two of the doctors are a couple who have a two-month-old baby. They were each shot in a thigh, while the baby survived unharmed. The other doctor, who lives in a separate house, was struck with a steel bar and shot in a thigh during the alleged robbery incident. She was admitted to intensive care and later released. Other doctors in the same section have threatened to leave the special houses allocated to them. Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba said some doctors had told her they would buy their own townhouses. “They said they will only work during the day,” she said. “They are angry and I’m angry along with them. Our clinics can’t operate 24 hours a day because nurses are traumatised due to continuous burglaries.” She said they are talking to both the minister of health and of police. She said she appreciated the doctors who helped their attacked colleagues. Premier Stanley Mathabatha said he believed local residents will work with the police. “These thugs live among us and surely somebody knows them.” Cases of attempted murder and house robbery have been opened. Limpopo police Commissioner Lieutenant -General Nneke Ledwaba said he had established a task team to hunt down the culprits. Anyone with information can contact Colonel Cecil Machimani on 082 451 7181 or report to the nearest police station.
