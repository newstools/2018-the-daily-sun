TERRIFIED residents called the SunTeam on Sunday to show them a plastic basin, a silver coin and abandoned clothes at the train bridge. They said they stopped walking under the bridge in Rolle Village, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, in September. Ntwanano Mathebula (56) told Daily Sun he was taking his cows to drink at a nearby river when he was greeted by a strange sight. “I was leading the cattle under the bridge to the N’wandlamhari River when I saw these evil looking things in the reeds. The clothes in red, black and white were abandoned there with a silver coin and a plastic basin.” “I thought a river snake was tricking me but then I realised it was a curse. I warned people to avoid the spot.” Traditional healer Annuary Ndlovu said clothes, silver coins and even animals were offered or abandoned by troubled or evil people who wanted to get rid of evil spirits following them or ruining their lives. “Usually they leave the clothes and the money with a live goat or chicken to appease the spirits or attract unsuspecting people passing by. “Once people are tempted and take the money or feast on the chicken or goat meat, the evil spirit or snake jumps on them. The curse will automatically spread to their entire family,” she said.
