Mzansi latest music sensation Mlindo the Vocalist has taken the industry by storm ever since his breakthrough. The 23-year-old Afro-soul singer from Egcekeni, KwaZulu-Natal is currently one of the hottest artists in Mzansi and is in high demand. So much so that he is constantly rushing from one gig to another. He performed his hit song Macala on the Idols SA finale with Kwesta and Thabsie on Sunday. However, many fans on social media believed his performance left a lot to be desired. The star took to social media to apologise to fans for his below par performance on the show and he offered an explanation for it. “I’d like to send my apologies to everyone for my not perfect performance on Idols SA tonight,” he said on Twitter after the show, “I had problems with performing with the ear-piece because I didn’t do the final sound check for the show as I was busy gigging, I’m really sorry to everyone.” Mlindo’s career took off after he collaborated with superstar producer DJ Maphorisa on a song titled AmaBlesser. He has now released his debut album Emakhaya which has been well recived by fans across the country. Meanwhile, AKA also had problems with his voice as he performed on the Idols SA finale. The star performed No Rush Remix with DJ Tira and Okmalumkoolkat and later his hits Fela in Versace and Jika with Yanga. “Thank You for tuning in. Apologies for state of my voice today. I really tried my best,” he tweeted after the show. His fans, however, saw nothing wrong with the performance. It is safe to say the Idols SA season 14 winner Yanga Sobetwa on the other hand, had no such problems as she captivated Mzansi throughout the night.
