CHIPPA United FC coach Eric Tinkler hopes to have a solid defence when they resume their Absa Premiership campaign on 27 November. The Fifa break has given Tinkler enough time to fine-tune his side, who will be boosted by the return of key defenders Thabo “Mr Cool” Nthethe and James Okwuosa from injury. The due will be ready for action when the Chilli Boys tackle Maritzburg United in a league clash at Harry Gwala Stadium on Tuesday 27 November (7:30pm). Nthethe missed Chippa’s goalless draw with Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs two weeks ago, while the former Nigerian national team player has been out injured for a while this season. Tinkler says he is pleased to see the return of his charges, as he needs their experience to help the team move away from the relegation zone. Chippa are currently 13th in the table with nine points from 10 league matches. They are five points ahead of bottom-placed AmaZulu, who have played the same number of matches. Chippa are one point ahead of the Team of Choice, who are second from bottom. “We will have James and Thabo against Maritzburg,” said Tinkler, who replaced Dan Malesela in August and has been in charge of the Port Elizabeth outfit in seven league games. “It will be a plus to have these guys back for us. As a coach you need all your players.” Asked what he has been doing to keep his team busy during this two-week break, the 48-year-old mentor said: “We have been playing tennis to move away from the same football routine we are used to. “We have also been spending some time indoors. But the boys have enjoyed the things we have been doing. I can see a good vibe when we are together, doing all we have to stay busy.” Defeat to Fadlu Davids’ charges could see Chippa drop to second bottom. But the Chilli Boys have certainly improved since the former SuperSport United and Cape Town City coach took over from Malesela three months ago.
