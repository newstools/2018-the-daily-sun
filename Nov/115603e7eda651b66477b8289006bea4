A small plane with a student pilot on board has made an
emergency landing in the middle of traffic on a US freeway. The California Highway Patrol said the plane landed safely
in the westbound lanes of Interstate 8 in El Cajon after reporting engine
trouble. Authorities say the single-engine Piper was carrying a
25-year-old pilot and a 36-year-old student. The video taken by a motorist on the freeway shows the plane
gliding down between cars and rolling along two lanes. The pilot and student pushed the plane to the freeway
shoulder to avoid blocking traffic.
