THEY refused to wait any longer for their RDPs. So the land invaders rented a bulldozer to level an open piece of land in Joe Slovo kasi and vowed to build their own homes. But the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality would have none of it and removed the half-built structures yesterday. The community didn’t take kindly to the intervention. To make their point, they torched a truck. Community leader Margaret Befile (60) said: “I didn’t have a choice but to come here and put up my shack because I’ve been applying for an RDP, without success.” Residents who erected shacks on the land came from various kasis around Nelson Mandela Bay such as New Brighton, KwaZakhele, Joe Slovo, Veeplaas and Zwide. “We’re trying to meet the municipality halfway. Our aim is to build proper houses and not wait for government to build them. “We went to the municipality to inquire about this land, and they told us it belonged to the agriculture department. The department said it belonged to the municipality.” Befile said the land had been vacant for years. She said it was only after they hired a bulldozer for R12 000 to clear the area that the municipality suddenly announced it had plans for the land. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said the protesters set a truck alight along Mission Road. “No arrests were made. Police have been sent to the area. A case of malicious damage to property was opened for investigation.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said the municipality removed about 300 illegal and incomplete structures. “No evictions were done. There were no people staying in the area. It was incomplete structures. “We call on residents to engage the municipality on land availability. The administration has taken a decision to move with speed in identifying and availing land for residential and other purposes.”
