ALL Matome Mothomoholo (55) wants is for his wife to pay back his money. “I don’t care if she doesn’t come back. She can stay in Tshwane for all I care. I just want my money,” he said. Matome, from Kagiso in Krugersdorp, Mogale City, recently retired and received a payout of R350 000. He transferred the money into his wife’s account on 5 October. “I knew there’d be a lot of debit orders coming for my money. I decided to transfer it into her account as she didn’t have any debit orders,” he said. Matome said a week later, his wife said she wanted to visit her family in Soweto. “She packed her bags as she usually did and left without her bank card,” he said. The next day, Matome took his wife’s bank card to withdraw some money at the ATM. “I was shocked when the machine cancelled the transaction.” But Matome claims he later found out his wife had reported the card missing the previous day. “She cleaned out her account and left me with nothing. I tried to call her, but her phone was off. She ran away with my hard-earned money. I tried calling her family and was told she was in Tshwane. “When I searched for a picture to give to the police, I realised she had taken them.” Matome’s wife Gladness Dhlamini denied the allegations. She said the money was transferred into her account, but she claimed she didn’t touch any of it. “I tried to use the money, but found out the bank had frozen transactions. I haven’t touched the money because he called the bank to complain,” said Gladness. Matome has opened a case of theft. Police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya said officers were still trying to find Gladness. “These cases can be difficult because we don’t know why the money was transferred, but we’ll look into it,” said Sibiya.
