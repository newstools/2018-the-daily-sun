THE IFP has booted Endumeni municipal speaker Bongiwe Mbatha-Makhathini out after she refused to leave her position. The speaker angered the party for ignoring its instruction to resign after being told to do so in September. She was recalled by the party, together with mayor Siboniso Mbatha, but Mbatha-Makhathini changed her mind and refused to hand in her resignation by the end of September. IFP national spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa told Daily Sun on Wednesday the party had terminated Mbatha-Makhathini’s membership on Tuesday. Hlengwa said when the party told her and the mayor they were being recalled, she agreed but later refused, which angered the party’s national executive committee. “She then took us to court and wasn’t successful. “The party met over the weekend and resolved to end her membership with immediate effect. “This means she loses her position as municipal speaker, because she was there as a proportional representative councillor.” The party earlier removed Mbatha-Makhathini and Mbatha, saying their relationship had broken down to the point where it was affecting service delivery. Apparently, the two were fighting about control of which companies would get municipal tenders. According to the Municipal Finance Act, it is a crime for councillors to be part of any decision regarding who gets tenders. Her problems got worse when the mayor allegedly hired a hitman to kill her. Mbatha and IFP Councillor Mthembeni Majola, as well as the alleged hitman, were bust and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. They are out on bail and the case returns to court on 3 December. On Wednesday, Daily Sun called Mbatha-Makhathini, who said she was in a meeting and would call back. She was sent questions as well but didn’t respond. Nor did she take calls. When she was called again yesterday, she didn’t want to comment.
