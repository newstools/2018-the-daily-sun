POLICE in Site B, Khayelitsha need SunReaders’ help to identity the body of a man. Police spokesman Captain Lowellan West said cops were called to the scene in a field in Qwezi Park, near an Engen garage, on 3 November. “When the police arrived, they found the badly burnt body of a man in the field,” West told Daily Sun. “We’re struggling to trace the relatives or family members of the dead man. “That’s why we’re pleading with readers to come forward and help us find the dead man’s family. “We hope someone out there will come forward with information that can help us.” Residents said they didn’t know the man. Nkosentle Mathinjwa (56) told the People’s Paper that the man was not from their area. “We’re not sure where this man comes from. “Maybe he’s from Gugulethu or even further away, so we hope that his family will be traced,” Nkosentle told Daily Sun.
