It’s November! The season for crazy looking moustaches and pre festive season shopping deals.  Of particular interest is Black Friday when retailers offer shoppers bargains! This is something that is gaining more and more traction in Mzansi. Here are some reliable Black Friday tips for you from HMD Global, the home of Nokia phones: - Set a budget: Set a clear budget and stick to it. No deal is worth it if you can’t actually afford it. - Go incognito: Open an incognito window when online, to enable private browsing and disable plugins. Some websites can track previous visits or coupon plug-ins, and adjust their prices accordingly. - Be a social guru: Have your eyes peeled on social media. Follow retailers on Twitter and Instagram, and like them on Facebook for up-to-date sale news on your social feed. Some stores also have deal alerts. - Price check ahead of time: Know the average cost of the item you want. Watch out for hidden shipping/delivery costs and inflated items that “seem” on sale. - Don’t purchase for the sake of it: Consider what you want ahead of time. Think needs, not wants. - Add to cart ahead of the rush: Once you’ve decided on what you really need, add those items to your cart in advance. In most cases your discount will appear as soon as the sale starts. - If it feels unsafe, it probably is: Make sure the website is safe and the payment portal is trusted and secure. According to a recent 2018 survey, 85% of Mzansi online shoppers use mobile devices for transactions and the number is growing. Remember, be patient, not impulsive and you are sure to grab yourself some great deals this Black Friday.
