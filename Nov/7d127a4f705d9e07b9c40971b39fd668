KAMOGETSWE Moloi (10) had just returned from a party on Saturday, bringing with him an early Christmas gift. She blew a whistle that was attached to her new doll, but it got stuck in her throat. The Moloi family rushed Kamogetswe to hospital, but she died the following day. Her sister Malehlohonolo (30) from White City, Soweto, said Kamogetswe choked to death. “We tried to make her cough, but the whistle wouldn’t move, so we decided to take her to Bheki Mlangeni Hospital. “But the doctors failed to remove the object in time, so my sister died.” She said when they got to the hospital doctors sedated Kamogetswe and promised she would be transported to either Charlotte Maxeke or Helen Joseph Hospital. “My sister was admitted during the day, but at 2am on Sunday she was still waiting to be transported to another hospital. “The doctor who was in charge of the day shift on Saturday told us he could not find a bed in another hospital. He knocked off and left my sister there.” She said when the night shift team came they repeated the doctor’s excuse. “They did not treat the situation as an emergency.” Gauteng health spokeswoman Patricia Mokoena said a query would be sent to the hospital.
