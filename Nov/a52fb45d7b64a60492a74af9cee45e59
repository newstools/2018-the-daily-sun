FORMER Public Protector Thuli Madonsela is warning Mzansi about people targeting the State Capture Inquiry. Madonsela tweeted; "A few months ago I was warned that #BellPottinger Operatives had regrouped and were targeting the #StateCaptureInquiry. If so be careful not to be sucked into their abyss #DailyThought." Twitter user @Thapelonyana responded to Mandodela's tweet asking her whose agenda is she serving and that she is no longer the PP so she needs to sit back.Madondela hit back: "Iâ€™ve become a journalist and an academic and serving the agenda of democracy by freely sharing information and letting the people discern for themselves as required in a functional democracy. Why does this bother you?"
