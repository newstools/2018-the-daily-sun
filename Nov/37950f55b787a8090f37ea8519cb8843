A WEEK ago, Nontobeko Khonkwane and her one-month-old baby didn’t know where their next meal would come from, or where they would sleep. But thanks to the kindness of SunLanders, the mum and child have been showered with donations and gifts. After reading about how the 35-year-old mum from Nomzamo, near Strand in Cape Town, had lost everything in a fire, people came forward to help. Nontobeko told Daily Sun: “People came in cars full of clothes and furniture. People from as far away as Limpopo sent me money. “I don’t know how to thank all these people. I feel really blessed. I’ve been saved from a bleak Christmas and my child has clothes to last her until she’s a year old.” Neighbour Gertie Gumede said: “Calls started coming from people asking to meet her at the mall to buy clothes for her and the baby. “We were all so surprised. The people really helped. She even has a new hairstyle.” Struggling to hold back tears, Nontobeko said if she could pay back everyone, she would. “Daily Sun, the help you have given me is amazing,” she said. “I’ll keep these papers so my child knows about all this when she’s grown up.” Lerato Lufalo, one of the people who helped Nontobeko, said she was moved after seeing a post about her on social media. “The picture of the baby touched me,” she said. “But I couldn’t drive to Cape Town as I’m in Joburg.” Lerato advised the poor and destitute to speak out when they experience challenges because there are always people who want to help.
