BLACK Leopards coach Joel Masutha is pleading for more patience from the club’s management and fans. The Premiership rookies are going through a rough patch and are firing blanks in front of goal. But the Lidoda Duvha coach insists it’s only a matter of time before his charges find their mojo. Leopards were unlucky to lose their Absa Premiership encounter 1-0 to Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Wednesday. Masutha’s charges created an avalanche of scoring chances and Amakhosi only had their No 1 goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune’s brilliant saves to thank for saving their hides. Willard Katsande punished the wasteful Leopards with a header four minutes before half-time. Lidoda Duvha travel to the Mother City next for a tricky fixture against Benni McCarthy’s Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm). Leopards have not won any of their last five matches but Masutha is not losing any sleep over that. He insists that he will stick with his players as he knows they are more than capable of turning the corner. Said the coach: “We are asking our fans and management to be patient as we are working hard. We have been playing well since the beginning of the season, but we are not scoring. Khune was outstanding in goal as he kept us out. “My players are doing the most difficult thing, creating lots of chances. I’ll keep pushing them and tell them positive things to improve the situation.” Although Mwape Musonda is missing chances at an alarming rate, Masutha says he will stick with him. He said: “I won’t point a finger at one player, the others must come to the party.” Masutha hopes they will turn the corner at the expense of the Citizens. He said: “I will keep supporting my players, we will soon get it right. We can go to Cape Town and win – why not? If we play like we did against Chiefs we can win there. They have a good pitch there that suits our brand of football.”
