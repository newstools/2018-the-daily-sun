NEWS of the death of Royal Eagles coach Roger Sikhakhane has left his family in shock. READ: ROGER SIKHAKHANE HAS PASSED AWAY This after the family received a phone call from the hospital informing them of his death. The 42-year-old from Richards Bay, north of KZN, died in hospital in Empangeni on Saturday morning. He had apparently been sick for about a year and spent about two weeks in hospital. Roger’s uncle, Sifiso Sikhakhane, told Daily Sun although he was sick and had spent time in hospital, they still hoped he would recover. Sifiso did not disclose the illness that led to Roger’s death. “He was still young and had a bright future ahead of him. He did a great job for the family and also the community he comes from.” Sifiso said Roger was passionate about soccer. He said he still wanted to work hard to build teams like he did when he promoted Thanda Roayl Zulu to the Premier Soccer League in 2016. He will be buried on Saturday.
