Barely two days after Motswako rapper Jabulani “HHP” Tsambo was buried, his son has been kicked out of his house. Family spokesman Nkululelo Ncana tweeted pictures of Jabba’s son’s clothes, including his school uniform and clothes, that were thrown on the pavement outside the house where he lived with his father. Ncana said the person also changed the locks of the house. Ncana tweeted “customary wife sent some heavies with questionable hygiene habits, and the cops saying we’re trespassing”. Ncana said a case of house breaking and entering has been opened with the Honeydew Police Station.
