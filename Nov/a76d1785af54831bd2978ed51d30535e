NINGI Khoza couldn’t hold back tears as she spoke about the murder of seven of her relatives yesterday. The bodies of the three women and four kids were found in their home in Vlakfontein, south of Joburg, on Monday after neighbours called cops and complained of a bad smell. Ningi (42) and Teboho Lekoetje, whose daughter was murdered, burst into tears when they were taken into a room where most of the bodies were found. Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane cried while comforting the family. Ningi from Katlehong in Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun: “All the bodies of the kids were rotten and they had been hit on their heads. “My elder sister’s skin was so damaged we struggled to see if it was her.” Nkosi-Malobane said they were told sharp objects had been used to murder the victims. “Two of the adults were sisters while the other victims were their children and one a grandchild. “The person we suspect was responsible is known to the family. “He had been staying with them for about three months.” She said the police had set up a task team to find him. “We believe he’s Zimbabwean, although he claimed to be South African.”
