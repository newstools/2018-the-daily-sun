Bongani Zungu claims that assistant coach Rulani Mokwena is the real boss at Orlando Pirates after footage showed him dismissing head coach Milutin "Micho"Â  Sredojevic on the side-line, on Tuesday. Moments after Justin Shonga gave the Buccaneers a two goal advantage in an eventual 2-1 win against Polokwane City at the Peter Mokaba Stadium, TV footage captured Mokwena dismissing Sredojevic as Pirates looked to make an immediate substitution. The Former Mamelodi Sundowns attacker, who worked under Mokwena during their time together at the club claimed that his former mentor is the actual man in charge at the Soweto giants. Zungu tweeted: "Coach Rhulani has made Pirates a top team again! @coach_rulani you the boss." The 26-year-old Amiens attacker went on to further claim that Mokwena was the actual person behind Mamelodi Sundowns' recent success - when winning a coveted treble - instead of head coach Pitso Mosimane. This has angered Cape Town City coach Benni Mccarthy who feels that Zungu disrespect Mosimane who helped build his career. However, Zungu went on and insisted that he is not disrespecting Mosimane and Micho.  Trust me its him. Even at sundowns ask @dolly_keagan07 he'll tell u
