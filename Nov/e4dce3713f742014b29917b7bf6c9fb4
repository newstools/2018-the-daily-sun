THANDANI Ntshumayelo cracks a big smile as he buries a ball in the back of the net. It’s early morning training session at Bidvest Wits’ Sturrock Park base and the “club-less” Ntshumayelo is going through individual drills on the sidelines as coach Gavin Hunt puts his charges through their paces. The 28-year-old looks thinner than he was a few months ago and is full of enthusiasm as he tucks the balls away. A strict diet programme and rigorous training sessions are working wonders for him. It won’t be long before he joins the rest of the team, as Hunt hinted he will be offering him a deal in January. “He just needs running. He knows how to play football, I’m not going to tell him much. He’s got an understanding and he’s got experience now from when I had him back then,” said Hunt. “He has been doing well at training and like I said he has the quality. “I think he could play for about 30 to 40 minutes and we are going to get to a point soon where I would say either or‚ you know. “There is no expectation though and we are taking it day by day. I hope we can sign him‚ it won’t be a bad call. “I don’t know if we have the budget but I told him he can play for nothing. “He has the quality and pedigree because he has won league titles‚ he has played in the Caf Champions League final and he knows what it takes to play at this level.” It’s been a long road to recovery for Ntshumayelo, who served a two-year drug ban. He may have to wait a little longer before he gets back to action. Meanwhile, Gift Motupa is eyeing his first silverware in the Telkom Knockout in a bid to achieve a goal he couldn’t accomplish during his Orlando Pirates and Baroka FC days. Wits visit Baroka in the TKO semi-finals at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday (3pm). “It would be good to win this cup because I’ve never won a trophy, so I think this club will give me that opportunity.”
