FIVE people died in a crash on the N1 near Modimolle Mountain in Limpopo on Saturday. A truck driver said he stopped on the side of the road when he saw two armed men approaching him. When he drove back onto the road, a white Toyota Tazz crashed into the back of the truck. All five of the Tazz’s occupants died at the scene. Limpopo Transport MEC Makoma Makhurupetje extended her condolences to the victims’ families. Cases of attempted armed robbery, attempted murder and culpable homicide were opened. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba said a special task team was set up to address crime on the N1. “People must be vigilant at all times as criminals often target motorists who stop along the road,” he told Daily Sun. Anyone with information that could lead to the suspects’ arrest is urged to contact Captain Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501.
