TEACHERS are meant to teach and uplift pupils socially, intellectually and emotionally. But a teacher from a school in Manguzi, north of Durban is accused of doing the opposite. He allegedly made five pupils pregnant, from five different schools in the area, over a period of five years. The teacher allegedly used threatening tactics so that the girls would not report him. Angry parents and villagers from the area now want the department to deal with the teacher. The SGB chairman of one of the schools told Daily Sun that a parent wrote a letter saying that the teacher had made her daughter pregnant. The letter said the teacher apparently asked the girl to abort the baby and then bury it in a shallow grave. The chairman said they received the letter at the beginning of this month. “We were shocked. We sent the letter to the department of education so that they can deal with the teacher accordingly,” he said. One of the victims, who is now 22, told Daily Sun the teacher threatened to kill her if she ever implicated him. She said she had to change schools after he impregnated her. He also threatened to kill her and her family if she told them that he was the father. “My child is now five years old. “I was still in grade 10 and 17 years old when he asked me to date him. “He said he was in love with me. But he also said he didn’t want people to know about us so I shouldn’t tell anyone. He was the only person I ever slept with.” She said she didn’t report him to cops. KZN Department of Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said: “We have instituted a full scale investigation into the matter. “We are also in the process of suspending him pending the investigation.”
