KING Monada’s latest single Malwedhe has become an internet sensation, and fans have been recording themselves fainting to the lyrics. The song has even been named #idibalachallenge. But it also brings danger and trouble. This is after two paramedics recorded themselves driving without safety belts and pretending to faint as they listened to the song. A man can be seen driving while his colleague, a woman, sings along while recording the action. The song is playing and as soon as it gets to the fainting part, both throw their heads either to the side or on their chests. Simon Zwane, a spokesman for Road Traffic Management Corporation, said this kind of behaviour would lead fans to an early grave. Zwane said it was dangerous for drivers to do the #idibalachallenge on the road. “I’ve seen the videos. When drivers take their eyes off the road, they can cause a fatal crash,” he said. “What they are doing is the same as SMSing while driving. Many fatal crashes are caused by this. “Crashes happen within a split second and drivers should keep their full concentration on the road,” said Zwane. And for a few pupils at Hoerskool Akasia in Tshwane, the challenge turned into trouble. The kids allegedly performed the challenge in the classroom. A video of their teacher reprimanding them was posted on Facebook. In the video, what looks like an angry teacher tells a group of pupils that she didn’t want them in her classroom until the end of the term. “I don’t want to see you in my classroom for the rest of the term. “I’ve had it with you. You can go to court with me. I’m so willing,” she said.
