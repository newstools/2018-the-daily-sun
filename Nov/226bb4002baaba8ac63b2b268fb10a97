HE grew up in a squatter camp in Tembisa, not far from the OR Tambo International Airport, watching the “flying air machines in the skies” with his young friends. When his dad, who worked as a cleaner for a security company at the airport took him along at weekends, a spark was ignited that charted his future. Today, Nkululeko Sokweba (25), is the man behind the controls of one of those very same machines, flying as a commercial pilot for South African Airways. Nkululeko told Daily Sun he was introduced to planes at the age of four when he went with his dad to what was then still Jan Smuts Airport. He said he was amazed by the magic of science that allowed such big machines to defy gravity. Nkululeko is still clocking up his flight hours for an instructor’s rating, and is currently enrolled at Unisa for a BSc degree in maths and physics. He said his lifetime opportunity came when he was accepted into South African Airways cadet programme in 2014. At the time, he was already enrolled at a flying school in Midrand, Grand Central Airport. On the South African Civil Aviation Facebook page, Nkululeko wrote: “Being able to soar free, defying the phenomenon of gravity, and understanding the gravity of one’s dreams to never give up” was what had kept him going. He wants to motivate young pupils to follow their dreams. Social media was recently abuzz with people congratulating him. Herrence Ngobeni: We need visionary young people to turn impossibilities upside down and open up more possibilities. We salute him. Kebone Molope: Well done. Would love our kids in the rural areas of North West to be motivated as well. Ntando Mevana: Big Ups! #Black empowerment, let this trend so that young people out there willd be motivated to do great things.
