“THE eye is the light you switch on and off, but if the main switch is completely off, it can’t be turned on. “Our eyes are like a light and our brain is the main switch.” Njabulo Ngubane, originally from KZN, learnt these words from his former principal at Sibonile School for the Visually Impaired, Lindiwe Mhlungu. “ To see is nothing. What matters is how you use your mind.” He is doing level 4 at City Deep Adult Education Centre in Joburg and will do three matric subjects next year. “I want to be a journalist and produce newspapers blind people can read. “It’s sad to find blind people waiting for someone to read for them or relying on the radio.” Njabulo (20) said it’s time that newspapers and the internet were available in Braille. “I love narrating stories and want to specialise in politics.” He’s a keen cricket player at Central Gauteng Blind Cricket. He has been playing cricket for three years, and last year he was named best bowler. He lost his sight during an exam. “I started crying and my friend told the teacher, who took me home. “My gogo was scared because I’d left home with sight.” He said he sees his blindness as an inspiration. He spent six years at home doing nothing after he became blind, but he doesn’t regret it. “God’s delay is perfect timing. It doesn’t matter how long it takes for me to achieve my goal,” he said.
