AFTER 15 years of waiting, Samora Machel residents in Cape Town finally have a satellite police station. CPF spokesman Bongani Maqungwana said they started asking for a police station back in 1999. “We wanted a fully fledged police station, not a satellite station but we can’t complain. We are grateful for what we got. It is better than not having a police station at all,” said Bongani. The community of Samora Machel will no longer have to travel to Nyanga to get police services. “Our people have been using the little money they have to travel to Nyanga but that will soon be in the past,” said Bongani. Asked if the police station will be open before December, Bongani said: “We hope the station will start operating before the end of this month.” Zandisile Khobeni (48) is happy about the cop shop in the area and believes it will decrease crime. Nyanga Police Station commander, Brigadier Vuyisile Ncatha, said their workload would be reduced. “Places like Sweet Home Farms, Vukuzenzele and Heinz Park will now fall under the new police station,” he said.
