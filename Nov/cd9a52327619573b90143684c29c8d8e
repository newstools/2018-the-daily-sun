PUPILS from Watersmeet Primary School in Ladysmith, KZN may have to get extra classes before their final exams. That’s because their teachers have been on a go slow since August, demanding that the KZN Education Department demote the new principal or fire him. The new principal was appointed in July after the previous one died in August 2017, but tension followed his appointment, with parents protesting for almost a month and teachers embarking on a go slow. This after the principal had allegedly faced sexual harassment issues in 2014. School Governing Body deputy chairman Thembinkosi Khumalo said the principal was a teacher at the school. “His appointment as principal left many parents angry,” said Khumalo. SGB chairwoman Nomaswazi Mdladla said they asked the department to resolve the issue. “We want an acting principal while the post is re-advertised. We have met department officials several times. “We will send a letter to the department to ask them to treat this matter as urgent,” said Mdladla. Attempts to get hold of the principal failed. The principal allegedly doesn’t come to school, but reports to the education circuit office. Department spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said he would check the matter with the district head of department as the SGB claimed to have reported it. “It takes time for these reports to get to us,” he said.
