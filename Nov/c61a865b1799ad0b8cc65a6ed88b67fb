EASTERN Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle has appointed Mlungisi Mvoko as Eastern Cape Education MEC. Mvoko has been human settlements MEC since March and has been acting as education MEC since the death of Mandla Makupula last month. Masualle’s spokesman Sonwabo Mbananga told Daily Sun: “Following the passing of the late MEC of education, the premier has appointed Mvoko as the new Eastern Cape MEC. “Newly sworn in provincial legislature member Babalo Madikizela, who is also ANC provincial treasurer, will take over the human settlements portfolio. “Madikizela will take the oath of office tomorrow. Deputy judge president David van Zyl will preside over the proceedings. Masualle wishes both Mvoko and Madikizela well in their new roles and responsibilities.” Mvoko became a member of the Eastern Cape legislature at the beginning of this year following his election as ANC deputy provincial chairman during the party’s provincial elective conference. ANC provincial spokesman Gift Ngqondi said: “The ANC welcomes the cabinet reshuffle. We believe the manner in which the reshuffle has been done will promote service delivery as the correct people have been allocated to the right jobs.”
