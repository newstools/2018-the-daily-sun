POLICE need help to find four suspects after an ATM was bombed near the hostels in Lwandle, Strand. The incident took place on Monday morning at about 3am. Lwandle cops were allegedly lured away from the police station by someone who called in with a false complaint. The ATM is a stone’s throw from the station and while police were attending to the fake grievance, the thugs bombed the ATM. Lindelwa Mkhenku said they were woken by two explosions. “They shook my house. Some people came out and were asked to lie low by the robbers. “Police took their time to arrive but they explained they’d received a call to attend a complaint, only to find it was fake,” she said. Residents apparently picked up the cash lying in the road and when the the police were delayed, it was like an early Christmas for them. One 29-year-old resident said: “I watched from a distance because I was scared but if I had been brave, I would also have come to collect some cash for myself.” Western Cape police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “According to reports, four armed men damaged the ATM before fleeing the scene in a red BMW with an unknown registration number.” He said at this stage it is also still unknown how much the robbers managed to take from the ATM. “Police are still investigating. “The suspects are unknown at this stage. “We ask anyone with information to call Detective- Captain Andries Geldenhuys of Lwandle police on 021 845 2060 or 082 522 3361.” On Sunday, robbers cut open an ATM in Kensington and also made off with cash.
