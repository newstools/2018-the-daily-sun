THE application for an urgent interdict to ban the ANC youth and women’s leagues, as well as the EFF, from protesting in front of the Jesus Dominion Church has been postponed. Church members Ntombomzi Mbaza, Mneko Mnyathela and Mandoda Cingo applied for the interdict in the Port Elizabeth High Court yesterday. They wanted to stop the organisations from picketing within 200m of their Port Elizabeth church branch in Govan Mbeki Avenue. Th ANC leagues and the EFF, along with angry social groups, closed the Port Elizabeth church last month. They claimed that it was a crime scene. Judge Thembekile Malusi postponed the matter to 27 November after it became apparent that the applicants were yet to receive a reply from the defendants. The applicants also wanted to reply to their affidavits. The church is led by controversial Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso, who is on trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court along with Lusanda Sulani (36) and Zukiswa Sitho (28). They face 97 charges of rape, sexual assault and human trafficking. In their court papers the applicants said political party members should be ordered not to assault, intimidate or harass congregants who entered the church. They also argued their right to practise religion and freedom of association had been undermined. The respondents’ affidavits said the applicants were aware of the alleged unlawful conduct from 20 October, yet did nothing. “There are no details of what actually happened from 21 October until 1 November, a period of 11 days that is unaccounted for. “This is just an abuse of court processes and the waste of this court’s time by the applicants,” the respondents said. Omotoso will be back in court on 10 December after his case was provisionally postponed to give his defence time to approach the Supreme Court of Appeal.
