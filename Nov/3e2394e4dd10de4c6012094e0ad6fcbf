INTERNATIONAL superstar Miley Cyrus is in South Africa. This as the singer was spotted shopping at the V&A shopping centre in Cape Town, Western Cape. Miley took several snaps with fans, who recognised her. Although it is no known exactly why she is in the country, the 25-year-old appeared to be holiday.  @mileycyrus spotted shopping in the Watershed yesterday by @recycledflipflopsculptures owner, Davis Ndungu. They definitely look like besties!?? A post shared by  V&A Waterfront (@vandawaterfront) on Nov 8, 2018 at 2:49am PST
