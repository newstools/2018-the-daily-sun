A MOTHER from Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, wants justice after her daughter (16) was allegedly raped by a member of the school governing body in September last year. The girl, fearing the man’s threats, had kept quiet. But when her school performance dropped, she reported the man to her teacher. The mum told the People’s Paper her child was on her way to school when the incident happened. “He forcibly dragged me to an abandoned house behind a church,” said the girl. “I tried to scream for help, but he told me to shut up. He took off my panties and raped me. When he was done he told me to go to school. He said if I told anyone he’d hurt me.” Her marks began dropping and she showed signs of depression. “I was scared to tell anyone about this because I feared for my life,” said the girl. “I decided to tell one of my teachers, who helped me report the matter to the police.” The mum said her daughter was still traumatised and had been bunking school. “What hurt us most is that we still see the abuser walking freely on the streets,” said the mother. A case was opened last month at the Acornhoek cop shop. Police spokesman Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said all the necessary statements were taken. “The docket has been sent to the prosecutor for a decision,” he said. Mpumalanga Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said they were not aware of the incident. “We’ve requested a full report from the school.”
