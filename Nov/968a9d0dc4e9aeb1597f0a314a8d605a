Ntombozuko Nomntsentse (37) from Nyanga, Cape Town was at work when she received a shocking call. Her 11-year-old son had been hit by a police car. The mum of three said the incident happened on 29 October. When she arrived at the scene she found her son badly hurt. “My child had blood all over his face. “He was with a woman who had called an ambulance. “My son spent four days in hospital before being discharged,” Ntombozuko told Daily Sun. She said she heard rumours that the cops who hit her son were drunk. She opened a case at the local cop shop. But a week later cops allegedly told her that the docket had been lost. “They told me they had lost the docket and a new one should be opened. “I was asked for a new statement,” said Ntombozuko. “I couldn’t understand why they needed a statement from me because I wasn’t there when the accident happened. “It was strange because witnesses had already given statements. “When we went to the scene again with the new investigating officer, people who live nearby didn’t want to give statements. “Most of them said they were not sure what happened on the day of the accident.” Ntombozuko said she suspected cops were covering for each other. She’s worried she might not get justice for her son. “I wonder how the cops feel after hurting my child. “They didn’t even visit us or asked how we were doing. “It’s as if they hit a dog. “My child is suffering,” she said. Western Cape police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “The case is still under investigation. “The detective is still in the process of interviewing possible witnesses. “The investigating officer will arrange counselling for the child. “The Independent Police Investigative Directorate was informed, but this case doesn’t fall under their mandate. “The detective is working around the clock to solve the case.”
