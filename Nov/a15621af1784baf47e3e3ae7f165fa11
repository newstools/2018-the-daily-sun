MADALA John Monyatsi lived in a rundown house in Virginia and police had been trying to reunite him with his family. But now the old man has passed away. The police need the community’s help to reunite him with his two children known only as Selina and Matsoso. Police spokesman Captain Malebo Khosana said the madala’s age was not known. Khosana told Daily Sun that the madala died on 12 November in a Virginia hospital. “Constable Phakiso Molotsoane of Hennenman SAPS social crime prevention unit was trying to unite him with his family before his death,” said Khosana. Molotsoane said he had been trying to locate the madala’s two children, who lived at an unknown address in Phomolong. Their madala had been living in a vandalised house in Barium Street, Saaiplaas. His body is currently in the mortuary of Katleho Hospital. Any person who might know the whereabouts of John’s next of kin is asked to call Constable Molotsoane on 073 642 3954 or contact their nearest police station.
