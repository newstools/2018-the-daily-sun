EVERY time he dropped his entry into the post, he knew that one day it would be his turn. His time finally arrived – and it could not have come at a better time! Smiling from ear to ear, Jennet Nkoana (65) from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni said he would be able to buy food for his family and grandchildren this festive season. “I have spent a lot of money extending the house so I was worried that I could only feed my family potatoes for Christmas,” said Jennet. “It was five years ago when I first read the paper from the front page to the last. As I was moving from one page to the next, I came across the grocery winner and I fell in love with the competition. Since then I have been entering the competition and each time I saw the winner’s name, I was encouraged, knowing that one day it would be my turn.” He said the people at the post office even asked him when he would stop because he’d been playing for so long without winning. “I smiled and said I would never give up because one day it would be me. “This is an early Christmas gift for me and my family. I am so grateful,” he said.
