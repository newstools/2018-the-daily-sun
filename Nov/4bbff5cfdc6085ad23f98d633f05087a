FORMER minister of Public Enterprises Barbara Hogan has told
the inquiry that Eskom, SAA and Transnet were among the 9 SOE's that fell under
her. Hogan says there is a great need for the Public Enterprises minister
to know what is happening at these State Owned Enterprises (SOE’s) She also made it clear that the minister must not interfere. Deputy Chief Justice Zondo wanted clarity on the role of the
president in the appointment of boards and CEOs of SOEs and Hogan said there is
no imagined role for the president in those appointments. “My experience is that the president stopped things from
going to Cabinet and instructed me to do things. Consultation is different from interfering with what a
minister does,” Hogan said. She said a certain faction, and highlighted that she doesn’t
like using the word ‘Faction’. According to her, the ‘Faction’ which supported former
president Zuma drove a different agenda and dictated to government what should
be happening. Hogan says after Maria Ramos left Transnet as the CEO, and
Pravin Gordhan was approved by the board to replace her. Following that however, Gordhan withdrew from the process
and Hogan says she informed Zuma about the vacant Transnet CEO and the
professional process to appoint one. Hogan says she had recommended Sipho Maseko and was worried
about Siyabonga Gama who was facing misconduct charges. Hogan says despite all this and rigorous recruitment
process, Zuma insisted that Gama should be CEO. She says Zuma never advanced any reasons why Maseko should
not be appointed. Hogan told the inquiry that Zuma told her no appointment
should be made until Gama's misconduct charges disciplinary hearings were over.
