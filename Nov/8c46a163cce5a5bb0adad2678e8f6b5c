DR NALEDI Pandor has called on university students to stop burning and vandalising property and buildings during protests. Pandor, minister for higher education and training, was speaking at the opening ceremony of a library at the University of Fort Hare’s East London campus. She said while it was the students’ right to protest, they could not damage infrastructure. “Students must stop burning and vandalising universities,” she said. Pandor said the brand new library will help to relieve the shortage of study, research and learning spaces for the three universities in the area. This R200 million collaborative library will cater for 18 000 students. It can seat about 2 500 people. The library was named after the late Dr Phyllis Ntantala, who was an author and activist. The library was built by the three universities and the education department, which contributed half the cost. Walter Sisulu University vice-chancellor Professor Rob Midgley said the project was the fulfilment of a dream which started a few years ago. University of Fort Hare vice-chancellor Professor Sakhela Buhlungu said: “Extra security has been installed. Destroying of buildings is not allowed here.” He said their next project was to develop the area into a student precinct. Dr Ntantala’s family attended the ceremony. Reverend Khazeka Ntantala-Somhlahlo said: “As a family, we’re honoured by the recognition of our sibling, especially as her name is immortalised by institutions of higher learning and training.” Mqokeleli Zaza (22), a social science student at Fort Hare, said: “We used to use a small old library with very little space. The new one is good for our studies.”
