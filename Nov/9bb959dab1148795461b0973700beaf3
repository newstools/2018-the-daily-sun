THERE was joy and excitement when the Free State Health Department announced that over 60 ambulances would be distributed throughout the province. The announcement was made at Caleb Motshabi in Bloemfontein on Wednesday. Premier Sisi Ntombela said: “We have visited Caleb Motshabi three times and people were complaining about delayed responses from ambulances. “We have over 60 ambulances, 20 mobile clinics and 32 cars which will be used to deliver health services to people. “However, we still haven’t decided when the ambulances will be distributed. “We are going to make sure all the small towns also get an ambulance.” Ntombela said the department was trying to bring primary health services directly to the people. “We plan to open a mobile clinic here as soon as possible,” she said. Health MEC Montsheng Tsiu said: “Our problem is that we have a shortage of ambulances, but today we are launching over 60 of them. We aim to launch more ambulances before the end of the financial year.” Resident Nabathakathi Phahlane (62) said: “I came here to check my blood pressure and the nurses gave me treatment. They advised me to visit the clinic once a month. I’m happy my life will be easier now.”
