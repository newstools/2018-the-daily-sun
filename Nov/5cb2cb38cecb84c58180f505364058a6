WITH each day, more facts are coming to the fore about the alleged involvement of the South African Communist Party in the VBS scandal. Last week, EFF’s Floyd Shivambu questioned whether Yunus Carrim of the SACP had a conflict of interest in chairing parliament’s standing committee on finance regarding VBS Bank. Yesterday, Daily Sun’s sister paper City Press reported that a R3 million donation was made to the SACP for its national congress last year at Birchwood Hotel in Ekurhuleni, allegedly to stop the party asking questions about the Guptas. When Shivambu questioned Carrim, who serves on the central committee and politburo of the SACP, he replied: “My precise answer to your question is no, most certainly no. “I know nothing about such a donation and no, most certainly no, I am not conflicted!” Shivambu wanted to know whether the SACP had received a donation of R3 million from VBS. Carrim said he was informed by the party’s office-bearers that the SACP received no such donation. “I have checked with the general secretary of the SACP, Blade Nzimande and national treasurer Joyce Moloi-Moropa, and both said the SACP has received no money from VBS or Vele Investments,” said Carrim. Limpopo SACP provincial secretary, Gilbert Kganyago, was suspended last Friday. Kganyago is linked to the looting of the bank during the time he was mayor of Capricorn Municipality. The SACP in Limpopo suspended Kganyago to give him time to clear his name.
