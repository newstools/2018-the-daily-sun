He was last seen in the casualty section but when his family went to visit him the next day, he was nowhere to be found. Lawrence Nkanyane (31) is believed to have gone missing from Tembisa Hospital, Ekurhuleni. His family told Daily Sun Lawrence was admitted on 4 November after he collapsed in the middle of the road. They say his neighbours called an ambulance to rush him to hospital. His brother, Edward (41), said he found his brother in a shocking state. He could not speak and was sitting in a wheelchair. According to his family, Lawrence, from Ivory Park in Tembisa doesn’t suffer any mental illness. They say the last time they saw him he was well. “When I arrived at the hospital I found him in casualty. He didn’t look well and couldn’t speak. No one knew what was wrong with him at the time,” Edward said. “I was told to take him to the X-ray room. I waited outside until they were done. I was then told to take him back to casualty, which I did.” Edward left his brother in the care of nurses. “When I returned the next morning, the staff couldn’t find him. I walked from ward to ward and even to the mortuary, but he wasn’t there. A nurse told me Lawrence was seen by a doctor at 7pm. I asked the matron for CCTV footage, but she refused. “It doesn’t matter whether he’s dead or not. All we want is to find my brother.” CEO, Dr Lekopane Mogaladi, said the matter was never brought to his attention. Details of the family were forwarded to him so he could look into the matter.
