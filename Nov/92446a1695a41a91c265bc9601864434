IT IS important to stay fit and healthy, and nobody knows that better than the gogos and madalas at the Regaugetswe Old Age Home. That is why they spend three days a week exercising. The SunTeam caught up with them at the home in Seshego zone 8, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, and found them doing aerobics. They were also visited by healthcare workers who gave them tips on how to live healthy lives. Idah Mothiba, the home’s assistant manager, said: “When we exercise we feel better and we become stronger.” Idah said they struggled with food, water and paying other costs because they relied on donations from individuals. Regaugetswe is home to 121 elderly people and has been running for over 15 years. During the session, social worker Tshepo Mogotsi told the gogos and the madalas about their rights. “Never allow your rights to be violated. The law says we must take care of you and protect you. Come to us if you have problems, even if it’s at home,” she said. A dietician, Nare Tshoshi, told them to eat fruit and vegetables. “Don’t eat too much salt and oil. Eat your meals at the right time and take your medication. Continue exercising because exercise is good for you,” said Nare. Madala Johannes Rakgeledi (78) said he has been as strong as an ox since arriving at the home.
