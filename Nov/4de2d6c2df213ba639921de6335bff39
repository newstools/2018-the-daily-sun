THE lovers were cuddling in bed inside the one-roomed shack when the romantic sleepover came to an abrupt, bloody end. Nombuso Mhlongo (35) and her boyfriend Zakhele Msomi (50) were ambushed at her home in Siyanda, north of Durban. They were beaten and hacked with a panga, allegedly by her jealous ex. She told Daily Sun they had just fallen asleep when she heard her ex shouting: “You’re sleeping comfortably in there, hey?” Consumed with jealous anger, the jilted man started breaking the door locks. “I got up and told him to go away. But he managed to break the door open. “He got inside the shack and started hacking me on the head with a panga. I ran outside and screamed for help. “He hacked Zakhele several times. I thought he was going to kill us.” Nombuso said after her ex had hacked her boyfriend, he ran away. But she kept shouting for help and neighbours came to their rescue. “One of the neighbours rushed us to KwaMashu Community Health Centre in his car.” Her boyfriend was recovering in hospital. “My ex was abusive, and he didn’t love me. “That’s why I decided to end the relationship three months ago. “I left him and found someone who loves me, but now he’s causing problems in my life.” She wanted her ex to be arrested so she could live in peace with her new man. Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident. “Cases of intimidation and assault were opened for investigation,” said Mbele. She said police were still looking for the suspect.
