The
Department of Labour has issued a warning to the public of a bogus website
going around on WhatsApp and other social media platforms. The
department explained that on the website there are fraudsters promising to help
members of the public on how to get their benefits. The
fraudsters are advising members of the public to follow the instructions on the
website. Labour
department Spokespman Teboho Thejane said the fraudsters further claim that
they have a list of “workers who worked between 1990 and 2018, have the rights
to get the benefits of R33 000 from the Department of Labour in South Africa”. Thejane
said the suspects’ further request unsuspecting victims to check if their names
are on the list of the people who have the rights to withdraw these benefits. “The
Department of Labour manages the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) and has
never published any list of people to withdraw any benefits as this is unlawful
and risky. People should stay away from such scams,” he said.
