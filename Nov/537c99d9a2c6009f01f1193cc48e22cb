PASSENGERS travelling from Joburg to Durban at the weekend had a bus ride from hell. After their bus broke down, they were squeezed into another one that was too small and their eight-hour road trip ended up taking over 17 hours! The African People Mover bus left Park Station at 10pm on Thursday night and passengers only arrived in Durban at 3pm the next day. Angry passenger Nozi May (46) from Florida, Joburg, said they found themselves stranded in the middle of the road near Harrismith, Free State, in the early hours of the morning. They had to ask nearby villagers for water and toilets. She said after a mechanic failed to fix the problem, the company sent a 51-seater bus for 65 passengers. “It was horrible. I had to give up my seat for an older woman and sat on the floor. The bus company only offered us a 50% discount on our next trip after we complained on arrival,” she said. Nozi said she and 11 friends were going on a weekend getaway and they had each paid R440 for a return ticket. Tumisang Kgaboesele, CEO of the bus company, said: “We have a dedicated customer care team to deal with all service related issues. The affected customers are more than welcome to contact the team. Service interruptions are unfortunately a reality across the entire transport industry.”
