A MOTHER and her five children desperately need help. Their shack was destroyed by heavy rain in Mndazo Village, Newcastle last Monday. Tholakele Zulu (38) has pleaded with Good Samaritans to help her rebuild her shack. “I lived with my five kids, aged between two and 12, before our shack was damaged by heavy rain. “We’ve since moved in with my neighbour,” Tholakele told Daily Sun. “I’d be happy if Good Samaritans could help me rebuild the shack.” Tholakele said she couldn’t rebuild the shack because she’s unemployed. She told the People’s Paper she tried getting help from the councillor, but had no success. “I waited for several days after the incident, hoping that the councillor would visit us, but she didn’t come,” said Tholakele. Her neighbour, Xolile Nxusa (43), said: “I decided to help because I saw that Tholakele and her kids had nowhere to go. “I don’t have money to help them rebuild their shack, but I can only accommodate them. I pray that a Good Samaritan will help the family rebuild their shack.” Councillor Bawinile Khumalo said she heard about the matter from the ward committee. She told the People’s Paper she had called the municipal disaster unit to attend to the matter. “I’ve contacted the family. They told me the disaster team arrived and told them they were going to be helped,” Khumalo said. “I’ve also contacted the disaster team. They’ve promised that they were going to deliver things such as blankets and food, as well as provide a temporary shelter.”
