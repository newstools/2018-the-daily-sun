ELISA’S tired of being treated like a ghost by Horror Affairs. She’s 33 years old and still has no ID. Elisa Makole from Diepsloot, north of Joburg, said she grew up without a mum and life has been hard. She used to live in Rustenburg, North West, where she applied for her ID. Elisa said since then, officials have been sending her from pillar to post. She said she had also gone to the Pretoria head office but still hasn’t been helped. Elisa has a five-year-old daughter who’s supposed to start school next year but she said she can’t do that without a birth certificate. She applied for her ID in 2005 and had now lost hope. Elisa said she couldn’t do anything for her child without an ID, and it drove her to think of killing herself. “I gathered a few family members and took them with me to Home Affairs but I’m still not getting any help.” Gauteng Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said he had referred the matter to the provincial manager. “We’ll assist her. The manager will delegate an official to contact the client,” he said.
