MIDVAAL mayor Bongani Baloyi said the DA might go to court to force the ANC in Emfuleni to do its job. He was speaking at the South African Human Rights Commission’s inquiry into the Vaal River sewage spill. Speaking at the Joburg Council Chambers yesterday, Baloyi said: “The situation has improved because they’re running the waste treatment facility better. “The spillage has stopped but you still find sludge in the Vaal River.” He said if Emfuleni Municipality didn’t run the waste treatment plant properly, the DA might have to take legal action. “At the Rosedene waste treatment facility, they couldn’t run the generator because they didn’t have diesel. “The municipality is facing significant financial challenges. “They don’t have diesel and their staff members just sit around and do nothing. “That illustrates the extent of the governance failure on their side,” he said. Baloyi said Midvaal had an agreement with Emfuleni that allowed Baloyi’s municipality to use their infrastructure. “We do our part and hope they do theirs. “We’re not even defaulting on payment. “If there was proper governance on their side, this wouldn’t have happened,” he said. Baloyi said the constant change of leadership in Emfuleni was frustrating. “Just as you’re about to resolve an issue with an understanding MMC, a change is made.” Baloyi said he had dealt with about five different water and sanitation MMCs in as many years. Environmental Affairs compliance director Sonnyboy Bapela said the department of water and sanitation had asked them to lay non-compliance charges against Midvaal Municipality.
