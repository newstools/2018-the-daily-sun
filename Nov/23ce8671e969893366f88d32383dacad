THE family of a 20-year-old man who was kidnapped last month is having sleepless nights. Athenkosi Boji of Zwide in Port Elizabeth was kidnapped by a group of gunmen near his home on 21 October. The men were apparently driving a silver Volvo. Athenkosi’s sister Nolusindiso (36) said: “It was on Sunday at about 6pm when we heard from kids playing on the street that Athenkosi was kidnapped by a group of armed men. “The kids said one of the men was a foreigner who rented a flat near our home. His landlord told us that the man had moved out four days before the incident. “We rushed to his business place in Missionvale, but he was nowhere to be found. “We’re appealing to Athenkosi’s kidnappers to bring back my brother because this whole thing has left our mum sick. What’s even worse is that my mum is still mourning the death of our father. “My dad was buried in August. Now my brother has been kidnapped.” Nolusindiso said they had no idea why Athenkosi was captured. “We wish we knew the motive for the kidnapping. “Athenkosi is a good young man. We’ve never heard any complaints about him. “We’ve even searched for him at hospitals and government mortuaries, but with no luck. “We just pray that he will come back home safely.” Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge confirmed the incident. He said: “Police are urging anyone with information that can assist with the investigation to call Detective-Sergeant Portia Dumeduze on 073 102 5521.”
