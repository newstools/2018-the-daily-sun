South African media personality DJ Sbu had a sit down interview with his good old friend, award winning Kwaito star Mzekezeke. Yes, we know. Interesting. Especially since many people believe the two are the same person, but DJ Sbu has dismissed that notion at every turn. DJ Sbu interviewed Mzekezeke live at the Massiv Metro radio station. Mzekezeke came on the 'DJ Sbu breakfast show' to promote his new latest single which dropped today called "Nay Lento". The kwaito stars full album is set to be release March 2019.
