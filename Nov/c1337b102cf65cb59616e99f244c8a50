CUBANA is a hot cocktail bar where the cool people go. But on Saturday as the sun rose, it became a little too hot for the night spot in Bloemfontein. It caught fire, leaving patrons and staff standing around in the street. Videos which have gone viral on Twitter show the place burning down at dawn. A Twitter user said the fire was a blessing from God and that relationships would be saved. Thabang Mosieleng (32) said he was looking forward to watch the derby between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates at the club. Cleopatra Mokoloane said: “Never underestimate the power of a praying married women. Wives are tired of their husbands going to places like Cubana.” A fireman said the place was totally gutted. “Nothing survived,” he told Daily Sun. “Fortunately no one was injured. It was a strong fire. The alcohol in the club didn’t make our job easier. It ignited more flames.” Mangaung Metro spokesman Qondile Khedama could not be reached for comment. He had earlier said no neighbouring structures were affected by the fire. Parkweg police spokeswoman Constable Wendy Nkabi said the praying wife was not reported to the police.
