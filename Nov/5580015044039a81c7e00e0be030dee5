ALGOA bus commuters in Nelson Mandela Bay are shocked by yet another increase. As of Saturday, commuters will have to pay R1 more for bus fares on most routes. This comes as the fuel price remains high and the rand’s value keeps dropping. The operator said they had no choice but to pass on the increase. Algoa Bus CEO Sicelo Duze said the decision to increase fares was difficult. “The company had to absorb fuel and other price hikes. A fare increase was unavoidable. “Fuel has gone up every month and we kept absorbing these costs but cannot do it anymore. “We regret the decision, considering the economic climate of the country and the high rate of unemployment,” Duze said. Nomilile Philip (53) from Motherewell said: “Every time the petrol price goes up, we suffer. I don’t understand why bus fares keep on going up. Early this year, the fare increased by R2 and now it’s R1, but these people are being subsidised. “Buses are supposed to help commuters not to feel the pinch, but not in Nelson Mandela Bay.” Mawabo Bangani (44) from Wells Estate said: “R1 seems like nothing but in the long run, we will feel the pinch as our salaries aren’t going up. It seems soon we will spend all our money on transport. “We are not coping. Government needs to intervene,” Mawabo said.
