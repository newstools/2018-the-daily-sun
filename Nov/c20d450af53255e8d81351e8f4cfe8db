IT WILL be jingle all the way to the garage for motorists after the price of petrol drops by R1,85 a litre. Motorists are calling the decrease their early Christmas gift – a welcome one at that! According to the Automobile Association, the price of diesel would come down by an estimated R1,40, and a litre of illuminating paraffin would cost R1,28 less. With these expected drops, the fuel prices will return to levels last seen around the middle of the year. The AA warned that the massive fuel price drop could, however, be reduced by the possible continued use of the Slate Levy. The Slate Levy is used to retrieve losses from the fuel price. “The see-saw ride in fuel prices over the past year has shown just how great the impact of international petroleum pricing and the rand/dollar exchange rate is on the lives of ordinary citizens. “The outlook for fuel pricing into 2019 remains cloudy, but we are hopeful that some stability will return,” the AA said. The department of energy is expected to announce the changes by the end of the week, and the new fuel prices will likely be implemented next Wednesday.
