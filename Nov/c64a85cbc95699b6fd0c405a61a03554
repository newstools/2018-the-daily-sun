HE’s a happy puppy and runs around the yard fighting and playing like any other dog. Except that he only has three legs! The four-month-old puppy has become a celebrity in Qaza Village, outside Malamulele in Limpopo. Pastors, cops, nurses, teachers and others visit Josiyasi N’wayila’s home to see his miracle puppy. Josiyasi (52) said: “My dog gave birth to four puppies four months ago. “I couldn’t believe my eyes when I realised one of them was born with three legs.” Josiyasi said he called his family and neighbours to come witness his miracle puppy. “The news of my puppy spread like wildfire. “People from other villages now visit my home to see my beautiful puppy.” He said he named the dog Masingita. “Masingita is Tsonga for miracle. I’ve never seen such a miracle in my life.” He said the puppy was very clever. “Masingita doesn’t want to share food with the other puppies,” he said. “He fights with them and always wins.” Family member Nwa-ginjha (73) said: “I’ve never seen a puppy born with three legs. This is a miracle. “I believe this puppy has brought luck to my family.” Limpopo Animal Health Technician Dicks Mashaba encouraged Josiyasi to take good care of Masingita. “I’ll visit Josiyasi’s home to see the puppy for myself,” said Mashaba.
