President Cyril Ramaphosa and Minister of Police General
Bheki Cele will formally launch the Anti-Gang Unit in Hanover Park, Cape Town
on Friday. The Anti-Gang Unit is made up of members from specialised
units and aims to dislodge and terminally weaken the capacity of the gangs where
they are prevalent across the country. The Unit also aims to disorganise and fundamentally
disable the criminal economy linked to gangsterism, including drug and firearm
supply lines or other identified commodities. “The Unit has been in operation since October 2018,
deployed in the Nyanga, Bonteheuwel and Bishop Lavis clusters in the Western
Cape Province and will continue to be in full operation in the Peninsula area
until communities in the greater Western Cape experience a return to normality. “However, the Anti-Gang Unit is a national competency
which will also be rolled out to Gauteng and the Eastern Cape Province and
wherever the need exists,” said presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko. She said Ramaphosa’s participation indicates his
commitment and that of government at large to ensure that communities are able
to live in safety while criminals are subjected to the full weight of the law.
