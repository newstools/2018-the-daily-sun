Miss World South Africa, Thulisa Keyi is already a front runner in the Miss World contests that are currently taking place in Chine ahead of the main event next month. The 26-year-old beauty queen from Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape, has already won the Miss World Designer Award (shared with the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China). She has also placed in the Top 5 for Miss World Top Model.
