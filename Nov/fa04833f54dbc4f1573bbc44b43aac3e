department of Putumayo where the girl, whose identity has not been revealed,
lived with her parents. The girl was originally from the rural area of Puerto
Leguizamo, but because of scant medical facilities, she had to be taken to a
neighbouring area to receive specialist care. After being taken to Hospital Maria Inmaculada in
Florencia, she had a C-section on November 1. Hospital director Camilo Diaz told local media:
"According to the information we have received from the police, the minor
became pregnant after she was sexually abused by a family member, apparently
her brother." According to local media, the girl’s parents did not want
to report their son to the local authorities. The baby is now under the protection of the neonatal
service, reports broadcaster Noticieros Televisa. El Colombiano says that the 10-year-old has been
discharged from hospital and is now under the “Family Commissioner of Florence
and the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare for protection measures." The police investigation into the claims of child abuse
