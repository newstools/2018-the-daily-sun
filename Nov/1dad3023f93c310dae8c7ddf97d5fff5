STOKVEL members are excited at the prospect of sharing their hard-earned savings among themselves this festive season. But some savings clubs members are worried after social media users posted a meme about stokvel robberies. The meme doing the rounds on social media states: “Angazi noma sengingabaleka nemali yestokfela or ngilinde kancane.” (I can’t make up my mind whether to run away with the stokvel money or stick around). A member of Siyathuthuka Social Club, Thabani Mkhize (45), said their stokvel used to bring cash. But when they realised the stokvels were robbery targets, they opted to deposit their savings. “When we meet we come with bank slips because all the members deposit money in the bank. We don’t keep cash with us,” said Mkhize. Another member of a stokvel in KwaMashu said they withdrew cash from the bank and met at a member’s house to divide it. “We’ve been doing this for five years, and we’ve never had any problems. “We trust each other. We live in one area.” KZN cops spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane urged stokvel members to take extra precautions when dealing with large amounts of cash. He said these types of stokvel robbery cases were widespread over the festive season. “Residents are cautioned against withdrawing large amounts of cash as criminals are on the prowl,” said Zwane.
