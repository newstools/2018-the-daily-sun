families who live on Latha Road in the Impola area of Mariannhill, west of Durban, said their street has turned into a dam. This is because a storm water drain has been blocked for several weeks. They said each time it rains heavily, water flows into their houses. Resident Nelisiwe Msomi (51) said the drain had been blocked since July. “It was after heavy rain that month that we noticed that water wasn’t going into the drain. “Instead, it had caused a dam in the road. “We thought it would dry up but it didn’t,” said Nelisiwe. Resident Nonhlanhla Phewa (44) said: “We have been forced to dig a trench so we can stop the rain water getting inside our houses.” She said they had reported the matter to the ward councillor several times but nothing had been done about it. She said they were now pleading with eThekwini Municipality to send workers to fix the problem. “Summer is regarded the rainy season so if this blockage is not fixed, our furniture will be damaged by rain water,” said Nonhlanhla. Councillor Nada Ngcobo denied he had received any report about the blocked drain. “I would be lying if I said I knew about that matter. “Nobody has ever called me or my office to report that. “They have also never contacted the ward committee members who are situated near that road,” said Ngcobo. However, Ngcobo promised he would report the matter to the municipality and ensure it’s fixed. Acting municipal spokesman Mandla Nsele said: “Thank you for bringing the matter to our attention. “We were not aware of the blocked drain. “The fault has been logged and an official has been sent to investigate. It will be addressed accordingly. “Residents are urged to report all flooding issues or problems associated with the storm water system on 080 131 3013 or email eservices@durban.gov.za”
