SOCIAL media used to be loved by celebrities as it guaranteed them lots of exposure. But it has also made them the target of fraudsters who can copy and paste their online profiles on just about any fraudulent scam there is. Their latest victim is actor and businesswoman Sophie Lichaba, who is now caught up in a bogus Bitcoin investment scam. To make matters worse, there’s a fake anti-aging cream linked to her name as well. The actress took to social media to lash out at the faceless online thugs who created fake social media pages under her name. “I’m exhausted by this social media nonsense. “We all know our accounts get hacked, but this is too much,” she said. According to Sophie, she was linked to the Bitcoin scam after her Facebook account was hacked. On Saturday she posted a screen shot of an article about a $2,5 million (about R35 million) Bitcoin scam. The story was later removed from the news site, but this didn’t stop Sophie from setting the record straight. Sophie said on 24 September a fake account was created and started posting on Facebook. “A false Twitter account also mirrored my @sophla_ndaba Twitter account. “My husband and I are in no way associated with Bitcoin investments or any other money schemes. “We have no intention to lure innocent families to invest,” said Sophie. The TV star said she was also alerted by Facebook friends that her name was being used to promote a skin cream. “I have not launched an anti-aging cream, nor have I have represented any cream brand to date. “Please refrain from using any facial cream associated with my name,” she said. Sophie has been in the spotlight for losing weight due to her battle with diabetes. The Generations star was diagnosed with diabetes four years ago.
