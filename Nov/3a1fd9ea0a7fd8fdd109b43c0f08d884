KAIZER Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas says he was happy with his side collecting maximum points against Black Leopards on Wednesday, however, he admitted it was not a top performance. Willard Katsande solitary goal in the 41st minute of the first half was enough to hand Amakhosi the much needed three points against Leopards in a match that was played at FNB Stadium. Chiefs are seem to be struggling when it comes to converting their chances. In their last five outings of all competitions Solinaâ€™s charges have only managed to score only three goals and that is a serious concern to their coach. The victory over Lidoda Duvha saw the side rise to fourth in the Premiership standings, they are five points behind Orlando Pirates who are leading the Absa premiership table. Nonetheless, Solinas takes the view that winning is the most important outcome though he does want to play beautiful football. Speaking after the match, the Italian born mentor said: "I like to play well and win the game, this is always my target. I want to play beautiful football and get a result, but the reality is that sometimes it's not easy. "Sometimes you don't play well but it's very important that you get the result, and this is the moment where Kaizer Chiefs need the result to gain confidence. "When it's possible, we'll play beautiful football that the fans can also enjoy, and we'll also get the result, this is the best. "But, sometimes it's not possible [to get both]. It's not possible to play football champagne every game, you know? "Sometimes you don't play well, and this is the moment you need to fight to get the result, but my target is always to try to play beautiful football, but reality is that sometimes it's not easy."When it's not possible to play well, please, we need to get the result because three points is three points." On Saturday Chiefs host Chippa United at Moses Mabhida Stadium (6pm). Amakhosi will play Chilli Boys behind closed doors.
