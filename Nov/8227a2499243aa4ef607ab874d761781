ALFRED has not cut his hair for 36 years. He said his long hair connected him with his ancestors and without it, he would be as good as dead. Alfred Ntshangase (54) from Sizanani informal settlement in Mamelodi East, Tshwane is proud of his dreadlocks. Alfred told Daily Sun: “I love my hair as it plays a huge role in my life. Being a Rasta is a beautiful thing. “Even though I was arrested in 1996 for selling and smoking dagga, I only cut my hair short because it was itching with a lot with small insects that gave me sleepless nights. I have never cut my hair since because it connects me with my ancestors.” He said his hair also gave him peace and joy. “I love my hair and women can’t stop appreciating it,” he said. Alfred cleans his hair with Sunlight soap and herbs, which he gets from the bush. The father of two said he would love to see others growing their hair. “I spend time teaching others the importance of loving one’s hair,” he said. Alfred doesn’t eat meat, smoke cigarettes or drink fizzy drinks.
