THE Electoral Commission of South Africa has warned farmers not to prevent political parties from campaigning on their farms. This follows a complaint by the EFF against a farmer in Witzenberg Municipality, who last week prevented the party from campaigning on his farm before next Wednesday’s by-election. On Saturday EFF members ran into trouble when they tried to campaign at Kromfontein farm. Private security was called to stop the Red Berets from entering the premises. Provincial electoral officer Courtney Sampson said it was unconstitutional to prevent political parties from gaining access to farm workers. “If the farmer is a member of Agri Wes-Kaap, we’ll speak to the organisation because they usually help us resolve these issues. “As far as we’re concerned, people who live on farms have the right to political participation,” said Sampson. EFF national spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the party plans to open a case against the farm owner. “We also call on the electoral commission to intervene. “Voters must not be hidden by racist farmers,” he said. When Daily Sun approached the farm owner for comment, he refused to speak to the SunTeam.
