KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo has urged residents to start running and walking. Dhlomo believes that the exercise will help people improve their quality of life and make them live longer. On Wednesday, the MEC took part in a 5km Durban wellness festival walk at the beach front. He said: “Diabetes and other non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, heart disease and stroke have become a major problem. “We’re told that six leg amputations per day or 2 500 per year are done at government hospitals in KZN.” Dhlomo said everyone should help to raise awareness about these diseases. “Regular exercise and getting rid of bad habits such as smoking, alcohol and substance abuse, as well as following a healthy and balanced diet can delay the start of diabetes and other diseases,” said Dhlomo. “Residents should get into the habit of being screened and tested for diabetes at leat once a year. It’s free of charge at public health facilities. “If you’re diagnosed with diabetes, it doesn’t mean the following year we’re going to cut off your leg. “There’s a lot you can do to delay the complications, such as running or walking. “By taking part in such activities, you’re improving your quality of life and you’ll live longer.” Nokukhanya Mdluli (41) said a lot of kasi people are not informed about the importance of exercise and how it wouldl benefit them. “I think kasi people should be encouraged to take part in such activities to avoid getting sick.” On Wednesday it was World Diabetes Day, which was commemorated around the world.
