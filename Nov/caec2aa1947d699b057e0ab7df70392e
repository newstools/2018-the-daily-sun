THE Uber driver rushed from the busy Durban CBD to pick up a client at the Musgrave Centre. But what he didn’t know was that death had hailed his ride, too. After 33-year-old driver Thami Xulu picked up the client, shots were fired at his car and his client was fatally wounded. Thami died in hospital. But Sibongiseni Biyela (33) told the People’s Paper the bullets were not meant for his friend Thami. “I think the gunmen had been waiting for the client to come out of the centre because, immediately after the client jumped into the car, bullets were fired,” he said. Thami continued to drive until the car hit the gate of a house near the centre. “I heard the two men, who were allegedly driving a Mercedes Benz, were carrying an AK47. “When Thami’s car was at the gate, one of them got out and went to the car and continued to fire more shots before they left.” Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident. “Murder charges were opened for investigation,” said Zwane.
