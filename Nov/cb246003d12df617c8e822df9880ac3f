Banyana Banyana started 2018 African Women’s Cup of Nation on a positive note with a victory over reigning champions Nigeria. After man’s national team Bafana Bafana drew 1-1 with Nigeria on Saturday in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier at FNB Stadium, Mzansi’s hopes of getting a victory against the West Africa’s opponents shifted to Banyana as they also had a date against Super Falcons of Nigeria. And the women's team did not disappoint. Desiree Ellis charges had to go head-to-head with Nigeria, for the better half of the match as the only goal that separated the two came in on the 84th minutes of the match. Star midfielder Thembi Kgatlana who was introduced in the 56 minutes of the match replacing Busi Ndimeni scored the solitary goal on the 84 minute to ensure Banyana collect maximum points at the Cape Coast Stadium Stadium in Ghana on Sunday. The two sides started the game in high spirits, creating few goalscoring opportunities but went to the half-time break tied on 0-0. Towards the end of the match Jermaine Seoposenwe delivered an inch-perfect chip that bounced right into Kgatlana’s path who released thunderous volley from a difficult angle to find the back of the net. Kgatlana nearly wrapped things up a few seconds later from another through-ball by Seoposenwe, but this time her first touch eluded her, and Nigeria goalkeeper Tochukwu Oluehi came out to smother the danger. But the South Africans held on for a memorable victory over the Super Falcons which was their second against Nigeria in history. The result has given Banyana a huge moral boost as team have vowed to make history in this years Awcon by finishing within the top three of the tournament to qualify for their first ever Fifa World Cup next year.
