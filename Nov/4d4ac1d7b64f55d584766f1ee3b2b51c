COPS were called by a farmer in Bothaville, Free State after 99 sheep were stolen. More information led the men in blue to a house in Orkney, North West. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said at least 60 sheep were recovered. Thakeng told Daily Sun: “On Thursday at about 5.30am, a farmer at Morester Farm in the Bothaville district reported a stock theft case after she discovered 99 sheep had been stolen from her kraal. “All the sheep were tattooed with the identification mark “JSP” on their ears. “They all had ear tags as well. The value of the stolen live stock is R297 000.” He said the sheep were forced out of the overnight kraal and led by foot to a loading place, where some of them were slaughtered, loaded onto an unknown vehicle and driven towards Bothaville. Thakeng said cops followed up on information, which led them to a house in Kanana, Orkney, where they recovered 13 sheep heads, 15 sheep skins, 69 sheep, six carcasses and six more carcasses with only the throats cut. “The suspects fled from the scene on arrival of the police. The suspects are known and are being followed. They will be arrested soon,” he said.
