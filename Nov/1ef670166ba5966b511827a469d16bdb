THE cruelty of criminals knows no bounds. On Friday, five thugs aged between 21 and 26 confronted a 55-year-old man in the Kuruman CBD and robbed him of his belongings. When he put up a fight, they threw him in front of an oncoming truck and ran away. Thanks to Kuruman police’s quick response, three of them were bust in the CBD. A fourth man was arrested at Tshwaragano Hospital, where he was being treated for injuries sustained while wrestling and pushing the victim beneath the moving truck. The fifth suspect was on the run. Police spokesman Captain Olebogeng Tawana said witnesses pointed out the three suspects. Tawana told the People’s Paper: “We’ve opened a case of culpable homicide against the truck driver after he failed to stop following the accident. “We don’t know the reason that could have made him drive away from the scene of the accident. “We’re appealing to him to report to the nearest police station as he could help us solve the case. “Any witnesses with information that could assist us in the investigation are asked to phone Kuruman station commander Brigadier Kenneth Baloyi on 082 495 4803 or 053 712 9800, or contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.”
