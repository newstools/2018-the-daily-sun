THE journey of an entrepreneur is a long, hard and lonely one. These were the words of Velaphi Mpolweni, owner of Lowe Furnishers and Decor. Velaphi was given the Achiever of the Year Award at the 2018 Tsogo Sun entrepreneur graduation ceremony. The ceremony was held at The Pivot in Fourways, Joburg. The event celebrated the achievements of entrepreneurs who were enrolled in the Tsogo Sun Enterprise programme. Velaphi opened his business after he lost his job in 2015. “I was retrenched and had five children to look after. I could have waited for my pension money, but I knew it wouldn’t be enough to support my children through varsity. “That’s why I decided to start a business and work hard to make it a success,” said Velaphi. ” Candy Tothill, general manager of corporate affairs for Tsogo Sun, said the development and personal growth the entrepreneurs gained was invaluable. Yvonne Manyiki, founder of Dimzique Jewellery, was one of the graduates. She said the programme was tough, but also exciting. Manyiki said she got the chance to network with people in various industries. She said she looked forward to working with the people she’d met on the programme.
