DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane has blamed unemployment on corruption. He said Mpumalanga had been chopped down by professional tsotsis and it was time for the DA to take over the province. Maimane was at St Georges Park in Emalahleni to launch the DA’s #TeamOneSA campaign against crime. He was accompanied by DA Mpumalanga premier candidate Jane Sithole and provincial chairman Bosman Grobler. Maimane said the poison of former premier and current deputy president David Mabuza had spread to every corner of the province and if the DA took over, the Mpumalanga ANC would be sent to prison. “The province should be rich from tourism, agriculture and mining. No one and nothing in Mpumalanga has escaped Mabuza’s poison,” he said. “Service delivery is very poor as communities are without water and sewers are overflowing. The province also has the highest youth unemployment rate in the country. “The DA is the only organisation that can lead the province to greater heights.” Maimane said all those involved in the VBS scandal should pay back the money and the DA would fight to make it happen. “Our offer is to fight corruption by giving a 15-year jail sentence to those found guilty. The VBS scandal is very serious and heads must roll,” he said. “The money needs to be paid back. Stealing from the poor is Satanism. Once we take over, all corrupt ANC officials will be wearing orange overalls at Sun City prison.” Sithole said when people in power gave jobs and tenders to their friends and family, they contributed to poverty. She said there were dozens of ghosts being paid by the extended public works programme, but nothing was done about it. “It’s the DA that can bring change. Our current government is led by liars,” she said. Campaign spokesman John Steenhuisen said Emalahleni was the second biggest crime and drug den in the country due to corruption and unemployment.
