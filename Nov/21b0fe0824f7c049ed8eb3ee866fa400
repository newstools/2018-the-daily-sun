 AFTER South Gauteng High Court Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng denied Lerato Sengadi’s interdict to stop HHP’s funeral, social media praised her for her bravery. The Judge also ruled that Lerato Sengadi is the lawful customary wife of Jabba. Some on social media went on to say: “I salute this lady because it’s known that the in-laws like treating the widow who’s in mourning like she suddenly doesn’t belong. Like she wasn’t the one who was married to their son.” #LeratoSengadi Then women must understand the requirements of customary law marriage as far as taking a 2nd and 3rd and 4th wife is concerned. You can't only practice it when it favours you. pic.twitter.com/kS7VEbxckO So it’s safe to assume that people will be armed to the teeth at the funeral tomorrow. Just in case the drunk uncles on both sides decide to square up over the casket. What a pity!#LeratoSengadi #hhp  Customary Law just got me confusing yaz ??#HHPFuneral #HHP#LeratoSengadi In black families, you know its a mess when the breadwinner gets married. #LeratoSengadi #LeratoSengadi I tried as hard as I could not to judge but what angered me is that #RIPJABBA will not be around to deny nor confirm what has been told to us as being loved when not loving himself... Apostle Paul made a brave to die alone A widow will seat at the mattress during the mourning period, even if the court ruled that out #LeratoSengadi is the wife not in our eyes period. Ke moleko... The VrrPhaas can now get on the road. #HHPFuneral#LeratoSengadi So according to this judgement “Go hlabisha bakgonyana” is not important anymore?? ?? If you know what the process entails then you will understand my worrie?? #LeratoSengadi#hhp I think as men who want to be buried at our traditional homesteads, we should start writing extensive "Wills" that state locations of our preferred burial places, so that the women we marry don't end up burying us in places we are not traditionally connected too! #LeratoSengadi
