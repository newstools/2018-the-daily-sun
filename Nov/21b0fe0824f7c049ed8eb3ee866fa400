 AFTER South Gauteng High Court Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng denied Lerato Sengadi’s interdict to stop HHP’s funeral, social media praised her for her bravery. The Judge also ruled that Lerato Sengadi is the lawful customary wife of Jabba. Some on social media went on to say: “I salute this lady because it’s known that the in-laws like treating the widow who’s in mourning like she suddenly doesn’t belong. Like she wasn’t the one who was married to their son.”
