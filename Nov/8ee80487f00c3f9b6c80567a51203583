A man was struck and killed by lighting in Sasolburg. The man and several others were reportedly working out when the rain began to fall, they then tried to seek cover in a nearby room when one of them was struck by lightning. “His colleagues pulled him into the room shortly after the incident and called emergency services,” ER24’s Werner Vermaak said. Vermaak said paramedics arrived on the scene and found the man with no signs of life. “Sadly, there was nothing that could be done for him and he was declared dead on the scene,” Vermaak said. Vermaak added that lightning is a very real danger in this country, and despite the general public knowing that it is dangerous, they don’t really seem to grasp just how dangerous it is. According to Vermaak, when there’s lighting – people should make sure that they are indoors, with all doors and windows closed. “Even though it is a beautiful show to watch, do not sit near the windows or doors, stay at least 2 meters away.” “Also, unplug all electronics, as lightning can strike power cables that are outside your home, and can travel into the electronic equipment via electricity cables,” Vermaak said.
