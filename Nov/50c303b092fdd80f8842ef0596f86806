THIS is one of the best performing schools in the Vaal, with 100% matric pass rate every year. It is also one of the oldest schools in Shaperville, having been around since the ‘70s. Although the school has survived several decades, it could not survive a fire! Four grade 11 and 12 classes at Mohloli Secondary School were burnt down during the early hours of Tuesday morning. Expensive smart boards in the classrooms were severely damaged in the fire and the roof caved in. Desks, chairs and textbooks were also lost in the fire. The fire came at a time when matric pupils have just started writing their final exams. Grade 11 pupils were also scheduled to write exams in the coming weeks. When Daily Sun visited the school yesterday, teaching was underway. Members of the School Governing Body and staff were still wondering what caused the fire. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the school yesterday to assess the damage and delivered much needed furniture to help the school continue their exams. Lesufi is expected to give details about the incident in a press briefing today. Police spokesman Captain Teboho Lephoto said investigations into the fire were underway. He said a case of business burglary was opened. “A laptop and speakers were stolen. No suspects have been arrested yet but investigations are ongoing.”
