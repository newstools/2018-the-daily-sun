COUNCILLOR Tshidiso Jakobo will remain in jail. Yesterday, the 56-year-old former Setsoto mayor was twice charged with stock theft in Clocolan Magistrates Court! The ward 8 councillor was bust last Thursday for stock theft for the second time. Jakobo appeared before magistrate Noluthando Mthombeni, who postponed his case to Monday for a bail application. The councillor appeared briefly and said he wanted to appoint a lawyer. According to police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini, Jakobo was bust for the first time on 27 September for the theft of two calves. Investigators traced them to an abattoir in Marquard, where Jakobo had allegedly sold them. When they were found, the calves had not yet been slaughtered. Dhlamini said: “Jakobo was released on R5 000 bail and the case was postponed to today for the appointment of a new attorney. “He was arrested again last Thursday for yet another case of stock theft of a calf and a cow that were traced through an ongoing investigation. “The animals were found hidden at an isolated place outside Clocolan.” The two cases of stock theft were postponed to Monday for a formal bail application.
