A CHURCH-GOER was stunned on Monday when he arrived at the church to pray and discovered the body of a dead man hanging from the roof. According to Nyasa Times, the tragedy happened at St Peter’s Anglican Cathedral on Likoma Island in Malawi. The shaken congregant who made the gruesome discovery is Charles Mwaithula. Cop Mcliff Ngulube said: “Mwaithula went into the church for his usual daily prayers. Upon entry, he was surprised to see the deceased hanging from the roof of the Cathedral.” He was cut down and rushed to hospital but it was too late. Cops identified the dead man as Kennedy Malikita from a nearby village. They later discovered that he had been accused of a rape the previous day.
