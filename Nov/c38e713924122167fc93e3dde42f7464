REALISING that Khayelitsha doesn’t have a baby shop, Zandi Tlhapi (32) decided to fill the gap. On 11 June, she opened her shop at Way of Life Church in Makhaza, selling everything from newborn babies up to six year-old kids. “Khayelitsha has big stores like Ackermans, Pep and Jet and when it comes to a black-owned local baby shop, mine is the only one,” bragged Zandi. The boilermaker by trade said she is working towards renting out accessories like prams and strollers. “I thought if someone comes from Joburg to Khayelitsha and they don’t have space in their cars or can’t transport prams or cots, I can make it easy for them. “Having baby stuff for hire will make a difference.” Before starting her business, she did a survey on Facebook and the response encouraged her. “People responded positively and I started going to business programmes at the National Youth Development Agency.” Zandi admits she has competition from big shops but said she doesn’t have to compete with any other start-up companies in the kasi. As a new businesswoman, she still face challenges and her business has its ups and downs. She wants to work with hospitals and clinics ekasi to buy or rent her products. “Imagine a hospital package which consists of everything a newborn’s mother needs just after birth, from surgical spirits to Vaseline, baby powder, facecloths, clothes, receiving blankets and more. “I’m still brainstorming ideas,” Zandi said. She also offers baby shower co-ordination services and held two events recently. She’s looking forward to working with kids in future. “I want to have my own baby range and a foundation providing girls aged 3–6 with clothing to make them look cute,” she said. Zandi will graduate from University of Cape Town’s graduate school of business incubation programme in Philippi next month.
