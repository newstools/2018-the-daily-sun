FORMER president Jacob Zuma asked ANC members to put their differences aside and focus on the upcoming elections. He was addressing party members in Pietermaritzburg, KZN Midlands on Monday. Zuma was joined by KZN ANC secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli and provincial spokeswoman Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu. He campaigned in Umlazi before he went to KK Hostel in Clermont and Retief Taxi Rank in Pietermaritzburg. Zuma told supporters the ANC was aiming at a two-thirds majority. “Every vote matters and this time around we must not take things for granted. “Each one of us must mobilise for an ANC vote. Even if someone is on a drip, we must make sure that person votes for the ANC,” said Zuma. He also warned against placing certain individuals above the party. “There must never be a time when comrades decide not to vote for the ANC because of disagreements. “If there are issues that must be discussed, let us put them aside and focus on the challenge at hand. “Once the elections are over, we can discuss family matters,” said Zuma. Ntuli told supporters that the ANC was pleased to have Zuma campaigning for the party.
