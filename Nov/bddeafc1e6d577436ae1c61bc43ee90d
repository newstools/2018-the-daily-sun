FALSELY accusing someone of rape is a crime. This is a serious reminder from cops from Bethlehem in the Free State. Police spokeswoman Constable Puleng Lebakeng of the family violence and child protection unit in the Bethlehem cluster said: “It has come to the attention of police that there is a trend for people to lay charges of rape and sexual offences that do not exist. “Such accusations are only to look for attention, out of spite, or to get revenge.” Lebakeng said this often happened when an intimate relationship went bad. She said often one of the partners came to the cop shop after a quarrel or disagreement and lay a false charge of rape. “In most cases a woman will cry rape and later withdraw charges and admit she was angry with her partner,” she said. “This doesn’t mean people have the right to rape. “Men must note that regardless of their relationship, no one has the right to impose themselves on another person without their consent. “Society must spread the message. No, means, no!” Bethlehem cluster commander Major-General Jan Tsotetsi said: “Those who lay false charges must be warned that if they lie under oath they will be charged with perjury. It takes special skills and scarce resources to investigate rape. “Rape must never be used to settle scores with partners.”
