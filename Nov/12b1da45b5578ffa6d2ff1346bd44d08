SOME were dancing, singing and praying to support the pastor while others stood quietly with raised fists to show they wanted him to remain behind bars. The 35-year-old pastor of the Tower of Faith Ministries was making his first appearance in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court yesterday. He was arrested on Friday after four girls opened rape cases against him. He faces charges of kidnapping, rape and sexual assault. Members of the ANC, the IFP and the DA stood together, insisting that the pastor not get bail. DA councillor Hlengiwe Biyela said: “We are against women and children abuse.” IFP representative Ishila Ramdary said “no bail for rape-accused pastor”. The ANC’s representative, Timy Ngema, said they would follow the trial until it was concluded. A resident (43) said the pastor should pay for what he did. “He took advantage of them. He should not get bail,” she said. Daily Sun reported on Monday that the residents devastated the pastor’s church after hearing what he had allegedly done. The matter was postponed to 6 December.
