HE won outstanding actor last night at the Royalty Soapie Awards. Now Isidingo actor Motlatsi Mafatshe wants to follow in the footsteps of his colleague Anga Makubalo by dabbling in both acting and music. Speaking to Sun Buzz, the star said he is releasing music. “I’m releasing my first single called falling next week on Friday. It’s a new a genre, it’s punk, but a happy song,” he said. He said the single will be followed by an album early next year. I have booked the Soweto theatre for a show on February 14 next year where my album will drop,” the star revealed, adding that the theme for the event will be black and red, as opposed to the tradition red and white. Said Motlatsi: “The album has different elements; I want people to bring their partners and enjoy love. I’m bringing a new genre, not necessarily R&B, but something new that I’ve always wanted to do”. He said he is not signed with any record label. “I compose my own music independently, I basically do everything myself, now I’m still shooting the music video for the song falling, which I will direct myself and use some of my friends, which I think are talented, because I also direct Isidingo, so I know how to do it,” the 35-year-old said. He added that he will work with different artists in his album.
