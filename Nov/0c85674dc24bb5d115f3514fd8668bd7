Former Thanda Royal Zulu and Chippa United coach Roger Sikhakhane has passed away. Sikhakhane has been unwell for about a year and his club Royal Eagles had recently given him sick leave after just four National First Division matches of the season. His assistants Kagisho Dikgacoi and Sazi Ngubani took over on an imterim basis. Earlier this week, Eagles confirmed the permanent appointment of Zlatko Krmpotic. Eagles, who have long been looking for promotion to the PSL, pinned their hopes on Sikhakhane to lead them to the top flight, as he previously did with Thanda. The news was confirmed by the Royal Eagles Instagram account on Saturday morning. The club posted, "As the @royaleaglesfc team and all our associates would like to pass our condolences to the Skhakhane family of late Coach Roger Skhakhane. Their loss is our loss their pain is our pain, he played a very massive role in our team... he’ll forever be remembered.
