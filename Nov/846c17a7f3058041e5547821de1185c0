BLACK Leopards’ Absa Premiership encounter with Mamelodi Sundowns has been postponed. The game was scheduled to take place at Thohoyandou Stadium on Wednesday 28 November but Lidoda Duvha have now confirmed that the match will be moved due to Sundowns’ involvement in the Caf Champions League. Sundowns will travel to Equatorial Guinea on the day to face Leones Vegetarianos in the first leg of their preliminary round Champions League clash. Leopards spokesman Barry Ramunenyiwa told SunSport that the new date for the fixture would be released in due course. “Yes, I can confirm that our game against Sundowns has been moved. We have yet to receive the new date from the league,” Ramunenyiwa said. Should Sundowns advance they will play the winner of the clash between FC Nouadibhou (Mauritania) and Ahli Benghazi of Libya in the group stage.
