THEIR job isn’t only to arrest and keep the peace. The men and women in blue in the Northern Cape surprised a poor family by showering them with presents. Beds, curtains, bedding, cupboards, carpets, toiletries, food and Bibles were some of the items the family received. Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock said the goods were handed over to the Moiloa family from Galeshewe in Kimberley on Wednesday. They were collected by the Northern Cape police office and retired police communications official Colonel Sam Sesing. The team also did some spring cleaning and spoilt the family with boxes filled with clothes for the festive season. Both the mum (36) and her son (20) are currently receiving medical treatment and are jobless. The theme for the day was Hawaiian Christmas. “This event also forms part of the build-up to 16 Days of No Violence Against Women and Children campaign from 25 November to 10 December.”
