Seasoned broadcast journalist Iman Rappetti returns to eNCA with a brand new talk show called Madam Speaker after two years away. Rappetti left the news channel two years ago to focus on family life after having been there for more than 11 years. The Phoenix, Kwa-Zulu Natal, native has done it all in the broadcast journalism field, she has interviewed some of the biggest names in the world, from former presidents Jacob Zuma and Thabo Mbeki to the queen of talk Oprah Winfrey. Her new show, Madam Speaker, will see her put newsmakers through their paces in front of a small group of ordinary South Africans. After her interrogation, the audience panel will have their chance to put their questions forward and state their views. Weekly topics on the show will range from politics and the economy to pressing social issues as well as arts and culture and religion. The idea is to give concerned citizens a chance to hear first-hand how real problems are being dealt with at the highest level and the opportunity to talk back. “While I will continue with my work on radio, television broadcasting is in my blood, and I look forward to this exciting weekly interchange where South Africans can state their case first hand and press for answers on issues impacting on their lives,” said Rappetti in a statement. Madam Speaker debuts on eNCA on Thursday, 22 November at 9:30pm.
