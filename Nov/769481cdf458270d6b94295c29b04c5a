NTHABISENG Nthite’s sweets are selling like hot cakes and her customers keep coming back for more. But it’s not because they are sweet. It’s because her punani sweets apparently make things hot and good in bed. Nthabiseng from Ga-Rankuwa zone 20, Tshwane said: “The sweets will tighten a woman’s punani and put a smile on her man’s face.” She said she had many happy customers to prove that the R20 sweets put the joy back in customers’ relationships and keep their lovers closer. Nthabiseng said she has been selling the sweets for years. Some of her customers even got married after eating the sweets. She said the sweets and dried fruit work to restore magic between the sheets. “For the best results, the woman must eat one sweet an hour before having sex,” she said. She said men go crazy after their women have eaten the punani sweets. “You can go all night without getting tired. It will give both of you energy,” she said. Nthabiseng would not tell where she bought the sweets, for fear of tough competition. As Nthabiseng was talking to the SunTeam, customers kept calling her. They were placing orders for the punani sweets. A customer came to her house. “I am here to buy women’s sweets,” she said. “These sweets are a secret to a tight punani and I love them.” Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said the sweets might have special muthi, but it was wrong for women to tighten their punanis.
