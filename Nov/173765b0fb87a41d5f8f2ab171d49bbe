KING Monada’s Malwedhe and the idibala dance have taken Mzansi by storm. But the unique dance, which sees people pretending to faint, has now landed two Joburg paramedics in hot water. A photo of them doing the dance behind the wheel has gone viral. Joburg Emergency Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said the two paramedics appeared before a disciplinary committee. “They were reprimanded because their actions send the wrong message to other motorists. One might lose control of their vehicle while doing that dance behind the wheel,” he said. King Monada, who is a road safety ambassador, said people must continue to have fun with the dance – but they must not do so in any unsafe situations. “They must not do that behind the wheel or in a situation that will put them in harm’s way,” he said. Road Traffic Management Corporation spokesman Simon Zwane said: “Emergency medical personnel routinely respond to road accidents and they should understand the danger of being distracted while driving,” he said. Zwane said he hoped the disciplinary hearing would send a strong message to public officials.
