Nigerian singer and songwriter, Mr Eazi is serving up some pan-African heat with the release of his anticipated mixtape, Life is Eazi Vol. II: Lagos to London. Mr Eazi, whose real name Oluwatosin Oluwole Ajibade, has released the 13-track mixtape which is now available for download and streaming. This is be his sophomore offering following his debut project titled Life is Eazi Vol. 1: Accra to Lagos. Since the release of his first body of work, Mr Eazi has gained prominence to a level that saw him collaborate with top-rated musos like Shekhinah and Rudimental. The new mixtape is released through Apple Music, where Mr Eazi’s international recording artist profile began to take shape two years ago after landing on the streaming service’s prime playlists. He has also appeared on Beats1 radio and became the face of Apple Music’s Up Next global new artist campaign in July 2016. The new mixtape has been described as “an exercise in Afro fusion and inter-cultural collaboration as Mr Eazi brings in heavy guns from South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe and Jamaica to serve the world stage via the United Kingdom”. He features Burna Boy and Mi Casa’s Mo T on the mixtape which he says was a very personal project for him. “This project is important to me because it’s a personal take on my journey over the last year. I want to take my fans and listeners on a sonic trip from Lagos to London, sharing the sound and artists that have been a part of this trip. It’s been great to bring my culture to the streets of the UK who knows where we will go next? For now get on board the bus and take this journey with me,” said Mr Eazi.
