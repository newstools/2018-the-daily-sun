WHEN the mum called her daughter on Sunday and was told she was sleeping, she didn’t realise something was wrong. On Monday, Thoko Khoza (70) heard the devastating news: the seven people found dead at a house in Vlakfontein, south of Joburg, were her daughters and grandkids. Read: 7 BODIES FOUND UNDER PILE OF SAND! Even the murdered children’s pre-school principal Tintswalo Shipalana thought they were attending a funeral in KZN. Mbali (52), Dudu (45), Nomfundo (28), Karabo (11), Luyanda (7), Nkanyiso (2) and Sibongakonke (2) were found buried in a shallow grave after police received a call about an awful smell. It’s alleged they were killed by a man who pretended to be their relative. Thoko, who lives in Pietermaritzburg, said when she called her daughter Mbali, the man answered her phone and told her she was sleeping. Mbali’s niece Sinehlanhla said she became suspicious after receiving a call from her aunt’s colleagues, saying she had not arrived at work. “They checked at her house but no one was there. I called my aunt but her phone was off. “I also called Dudu and Nomfundo, but their phones were also off,” she said. Sinehlanhla said she called her mum, who lives in Joburg, to check on them and realised something was terribly wrong after noticing the smell. The bodies will be taken to Pietermaritzburg tomorrow and will be buried on Sunday.
