PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has launched the Anti-Gang Unit in Hanover Park, Cape Town. The Anti-Gang Unit is made up of members from the specialised units and aims to dislodge and fatally weaken the capacity of the gangs, where they are prevalent across the country. Ramaphosa handed over 50 brand new BMW 1-series to the unit. The Unit also aims to disorganise and fundamentally disable the criminal economy linked to gangsterism, including drug and firearm supply lines or other identified commodities. “The Unit has been in operation since October 2018, deployed in the Nyanga, Bonteheuwel and Bishop Lavis clusters in the Western Cape Province and will continue to be in full operation in the Peninsula area until communities in the greater Western Cape experience a return to normality. “However, the Anti-Gang Unit is a national competency which will also be rolled out to Gauteng and the Eastern Cape Province and wherever the need exists,” said presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko.
