FOLLOWING a number of crashes, Elundini Municipality decided to build speed humps on the road between Ugie and the nearby kasi. Residents were happy when they heard the news. But two years later, the speed bumps are causing problems. Residents claim the speed humps were poorly built. DA Councillor Lulamo Pili said: “The council approved funding of R500 000 for the project. “A tender was given to a company in Richards Bay. “The company was paid in full but it left holes in the road for months. The council put out another tender for the same project and after a while, municipal workers without the skills were sent to finish the speed humps.” Pili said it was not the first time he had complained about wasteful expenditure. He claimed he was always ignored by municipal manager Khaya Gashi. He also claimed the speed humps were paid for with money from the municipal infrastructural grant. “I complained about a 12-month contract of R490 000 given to a wellness company to give support to municipal workers. “After the company was paid in full, they had a launch for the programme but one day later, they were nowhere to be seen,” said Pili. Ghashi said a tender was published for speed humps and six bids were received. “The successful bidder was a company called Urban Africa Services. “But we deny the funding for the project came out of the municipal infrastructural grant.” A manager at Mbono Corporate Wellness confirmed they got a tender from the municipality. “But I’m not in a position to give further details,” she said.
