COPS are looking for Sibusiso Mahlangu in connection with a pending rape case. He skipped bail six years ago. Police in the Northern Cape have asked SunReaders to help them track down Mahlangu (29). He allegedly committed the rape in Hartswater in the Northern Cape in August 2012. Northern Cape police spokesman Captain Olebogeng Tawana said Mahlangu was believed to be in Soshanguve, Tshwane, and working as a taximan. Tawana said: “A warrant for his arrest was issued after he failed to appear in the Hartswater Magistrates Court. “He’s suspected to be in Soshanguve in Gauteng, where he’s probably a taxi driver. “Anyone with information that could assist us to apprehend Mahlangu is requested to contact Detective Sergeant Dibolelo Sehako on 053 456 5202 or 072 205 0623. “Alternatively, call the CrimeStop number 08600 10111. All shared information will be treated with the strictest confidentiality.”
