SIBONGILE said she is haunted by the sight of her baby boy in a red plastic bag. “I can’t sleep at night and I will not rest until justice is served,” said Sibongile Ndlovu (30) from Meadowlands, Soweto. Sibongile told Daily Sun she had a headache and a runny tummy on Thursday and soon after that she began bleeding. “I thought I was getting my period. The last time I had my period was in 2016 before my daughter was conceived,” she said. “I called an ambulance and it arrived in the afternoon. The paramedics told me to drink a lot of water and maybe my headache would go away. Then they left.” But at about 1am her stomach pains got worse and she was taken to Meadowlands Clinic where she was checked in. “The nurse told me I was six months pregnant and was about to give birth. I was shaking and was told to lie down on the bed. I told the nurse I could feel my baby coming out but I was ignored,” said Sibongile. She said the urge to push hit her and she pushed her baby out. Sibongile said her baby was born inside the placenta and was moving inside it. They only came to me when they saw the baby on the bed. They wasted time before popping the placenta. They were calling each other to look at my baby for about 45 minutes. “After that they put him inside a red plastic bag and handed him over to me,” said Sibongile. “Had those nurses done their job properly my baby would still be alive.” Maria Mazibuko, a department of health manager, said: “A meeting has been scheduled with the patient for Friday. Counselling will be provided for her when she attends the meeting.”
