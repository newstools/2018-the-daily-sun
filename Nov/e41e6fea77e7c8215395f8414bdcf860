COPS in Mfume village, south of Durban, are on the hunt for a jealous boyfriend who allegedly torched his ex-girlfriend’s home when she dumped him. The man allegedly stormed Samukelisiwe Lembede’s home on Friday night and demanded to see her. Fortunately, everyone in the homestead had gone into hiding. A neighbour said the Lembede family was told to be careful after the ex-boyfriend was spotted near their home earlier in the day. Another neighbour told Daily Sun Samukelisiwe said her ex-boyfriend had threatened to kill her. She said Samukelisiwe went into hiding because she feared for her life. “We know he was looking for her so when kids told us they had seen him, we told Samukelisiwe’s mum and her cousin to run,” she said. The neighbour said the ex-boyfriend fired several shots in the air and burnt the homestead. “We wanted to put out the fire, but we were scared the man would shoot at us. “All we could do is watch from our windows.” Other neighbours said the man was from Malukazi, outside Isipingo. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of malicious damage to property was opened at Umkomaas cop shop.
