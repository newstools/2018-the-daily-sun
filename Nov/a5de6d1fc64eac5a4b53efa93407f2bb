Kaizer Chiefs are confident that both Lebogang Manyama and Bernard Parker will be fit for Saturday's Telkom Knockout semi-final against Orlando Pirates. Manyama was injured in a car accident in October while Parker has been side-lined in recent weeks with an injury. Amakhosi spokesman Vina Maphosa was reported in the Citizen website as saying: "We only do injury updates on Tuesdays, but I can confirm Manyama has started training. "Even if you were asking about the fittest player in the team right now I would not confirm nor deny their availability at this time as that we do on Thursday’s." Meanwhile, Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas was hopeful over the pair, adding: "I hope we can recover these players. "It is very important, because that will give us more options in the starting line-up and more options also on the bench." And on Wiseman Meyiwa, who also in car accident, a club statement read: "Wiseman Meyiwa is out of ICU. He is stable under the care of a specialist’s supervision. The club appreciates all the messages of support and prayers for Meyiwa." SOURCE: SPORT24
