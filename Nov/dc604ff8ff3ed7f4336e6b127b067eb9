GQOM trio Love Devotion is determined to make songs that appeal to music lovers across the country. The group featured DJ Tira on the remix of their song Ininja. Love Devotion members Dulcie Mthembu (24), Sanelisiwe Ngema (23) and Khwezi Madwe (34), said they believed working with Tira would be the answer to their prayers. They said they started making house and Durban kwaito in 2012. They eventually decided to record a gqom song because the genre is the talk of the town. “We released Ininja last year but the original version was Durban kwaito. “This year we asked Tira to feature on the remix and the new version turned into gqom,” said Sanelisiwe. She said Tira understood music because he had been in the industry for a long time. “Tira is willing to help wherever he can. “He’s experienced and he knows a lot about the industry. “Working with him will make us shine.” Sanelisiwe said the group had performed at a large number of popular events. “This year we performed at Gqom in Concert and the Durban July. “We also signed a licensing deal with Gallo Records. “We hope our fans will dance to our music this summer.”
