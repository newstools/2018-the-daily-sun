COSATU has called on Premier Willies Mchunu to act against Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo. The union federation’s provincial chairman Sikhumbuzo Mdlalose told Daily Sun the MEC was a failure. Mdlalose’s comments come after mortuary workers went on a go-slow because of poor working conditions. It started at Fort Napier Mortuary in Pietermaritzburg three weeks ago, and it has now spread to other mortuaries. He said Dhlomo seemed to be confused as to whether he was an MEC or medical doctor. “As far as we know, Dhlomo was sent to the department to give political direction, not to be a standby doctor. “We understand he’s a medical doctor by profession. But if he misses practising as a doctor, he must ask the premier to release him from his position.” Mdlalose said Cosatu would march to the premier’s office today to demand that he do something about the MEC’s failure to perform his duties. He said Dhlomo was failing to do simple things like providing protective clothing for mortuary workers. “Instead of the MEC addressing problems when workers complain, we see him rushing to do the work of the staff and conducting post mortems. This is a sign that he doesn’t take workers’ complaints seriously.” Health spokesman Sibongiseni Mkhize refused to respond to Cosatu’s call. He said the go-slow at Fort Napier had led to many families being forced to cancel loved ones’ burials.
