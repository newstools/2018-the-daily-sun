Local success story Trevor Noah has, through the Trevor Noah Foundation, launched a fund-raising mission to help school children and teachers in South Africa. The crowd-funding effort is in line with Trevor and the foundation’s wish to improve the state of the education system in Mzansi. And what’s more, Trevor has vowed to match however much money the campaign is able to raise, up to R2million. This means that if the campaign is able to raise at least R2million, then a guaranteed R4million investment will be made into education in South Africa by the Trevor Noah Foundation, which launched in 2017. The foundation is running the campaign through the BackaBuddy website, a popular crowd-funding site. “Our end goal is to get as many children who do not have access to education, educated. We want to get teachers the support they need, because teachers are underpaid and we want to make sure that the people who educated those children actually have food and ways to sustain themselves,” said Trevor, who is the chairman of the Trevor Noah Foundation. icymi: HERE’S HOW TREVOR NOAH FELT ON HIS “SPECIAL” DAY Trevor and the foundation are asking people to participate in an international movement known as #GivingTuesday, which sees people from around the world donating their resources to helping someone else. It is Trevor’s hope that every Tuesday, people will donate money to his foundation. Of course, people are more than welcome to make donations on any other day of week by vising the crowd funding website here. “I’m excited to announce, that I’m gonna be donating more money into the Trevor Noah Foundation which support schools and teachers around South Africa… I want to challenge you to do the same thing. I will be donating whatever you do and will be matching it up to R2milllion,” said Trevor. So far, the campaign has managed to raise R 51 487.79.
