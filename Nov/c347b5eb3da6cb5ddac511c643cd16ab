Durban’s finest comedian and Gagasi FM host, Felix Hlophe has tied the knot to the love of his life, Tracey Smith. Tracey is not only Felix’s sweetheart, but she is also the mother of his first-born son. The couple got hitched in a white wedding ceremony, a day that Felix has described as the best day of his life. The festivities began on Saturday, 24 November when the bride and groom-to-be held their respective bachelorette and bachelor parties. Then on Sunday, it was all wedding bells as the couple said “I Do” in a beautiful ceremony in Durban. They have since begun their honeymoon, keeping things local in Durban. Felix also took the time to share a tear-jerking message to his special lady on social media. “When someone chooses you in a world full of 7 billion people. Then they leave their family and the comfort of their home and come live with you. They relinquish their surname and take up yours. They allow their bodies to change and bare your offspring inside of them. Risk their life giving birth to your child. Endure sleepless nights nurturing your child. They cook for you every day. Make sure you have clean clothes on your back. Motivate you to go for your dreams. Comfort you when you meet disappointment. You will change the way you look at [the] world. I just want to cry. I am so lucky, I am married to a woman. I will not fail her. I will rise and rise and rise. I will work harder. I will never fail. I wish I had known this feeling much earlier,” he said. Congratulations to the happy couple.        @felixhlophe @kingsilinda ‘Wow Mr Hlophe yeah man > Protect your wife, Provide and Love her.... ungakhohlwa ‘what I told you yesterday ????
