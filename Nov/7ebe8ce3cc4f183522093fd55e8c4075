A TEEN reeling from the horror of being violently raped
had to endure still more trauma when a cop then labelled her a prostitute and
sprayed teargas in her face. He even threatened to spray teargas in the schoolgirl’s
punani as well! These are the allegations heard in the Lagos State
Special Offences Court in Nigeria on Tuesday, according to Punch. On 15 September 2015, the girl – who was then 15 – was on
her way back home from a church programme when she stopped at the shops to buy
things for her mum. There she met the man who was allegedly to become her rapist. Telling her that her uncle was at his house, the man
tricked her into going with her to his house. She told the court: “When we got to his place, I refused
to go inside the house, so I stood outside and asked him about my uncle. He didn’t
reply but immediately grabbed my hand and started touching my buttocks and
breasts. “I struggled to free myself and begged him to leave me or
I would scream. But he wouldn’t listen. So I asked him to allow me to go home,
but he dragged me to a corner of the compound, under a tree.” Tragically, a passing man not only refused to help the
schoolgirl, but allegedly even held her down to make life easier for her
rapist. Thankfully a decent man finally saw the cruel crime being
committed and rescued the teenager. But the girl’s nightmare wasn’t over. She said: “When I got to the station and narrated what
happened to me, the officer began to abuse me and called me a prostitute. He
said I was a prostitute for following the man to his house. He said it was my
fault. “The officer brought teargas from his table and sprayed
it in my eyes while calling me several unprintable names. “He even wanted to spray the teargas into my private
parts until I begged him and he left me.” Justice Sybil Nwaka adjourned the matter until 30 January
2019 when the trial will continue.
