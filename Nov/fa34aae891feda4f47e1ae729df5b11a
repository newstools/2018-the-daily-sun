SHE was sitting with her friends when she suddenly had a craving for an avocado. But it cost the 46-year-old woman her life. She was hit by a truck on Dr Belcher Road in Joe Slovo kasi, Mangaung, on Saturday. Her friend told Daily Sun they were enjoying cold drinks when the victim said she wanted an avocado. “I told her to wait and we would go together later. “But she did not want to wait. She left alone,” said the friend. She said it was the last time she saw the victim alive. “After 30 minutes one of the kids came running to tell us my friend was hit by a truck.” She said they went to the scene and found her friend’s body on the road covered with a blanket. “My friend would still be alive if she had waited. I’ll forever miss her. May her soul rest in peace.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said: “We confirm the incident and a case of culpable homicide has been opened.”
