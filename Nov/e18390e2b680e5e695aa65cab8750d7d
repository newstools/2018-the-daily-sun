He started writing in 2014. “I write about what I’ve been through, my perspective, and what I’ve seen people go through. Anyone can relate to what I write about.” His first published book was Take It From Me – A Man’s Perspective, which received rave reviews. The second one, What’s Your Problem – A Man’s Perspective, was published last year. The third in the series, God and Love – A Man’s Perspective, will be out in February.Sipho said writing about his personal life wasn’t always easy. “You’ll come across people who’ll judge you or make assumptions based on what you wrote, but there are those who’re willing to learn. I’ll always stay true to myself, no matter what.” He said he hoped his books would change people’s lives. He is a radio host with 20 years’ experience and does the Sunday afternoon slot on KCRS FM. He’s also a motivational speaker, MC, singer, actor, event co-ordinator and entrepreneur.
