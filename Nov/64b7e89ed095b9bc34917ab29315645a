South Africa’s under-17 Women’s team will head into their second 2018 Womens World Cup Groub B game full of confidence after a valiant effort against Mexico in their first game. Bantwana will take on Japan in a match scheduled to take place at the Estadio Domingo Burgueño Miguel in Uruguay on Friday 16 November at (7pm SA Time). Simphiwe Dludlu’s charges played to a goalless draw against Mexico on Tuesday, a result that will boost their confidence going forward in the tournament. The other Group B match between Japan and Brazil also finished in a 0-0 draw. This has left all four teams in the group with a point each from opening games after a pair of goalless stalemates. South Africa, who are still searching for their first ever win at the under 17 Women’s World Cup, will have to repeat their exploits against Mexico If they are to get anything out of the game against Japan. Their defence, especially the full backs, will have to improve as they were exposed on numerous occasions by the Mexicans who were wasteful in front of goal. In attack, Bantwana were limited to just 5 shots in the entire game with only 1 being on target. They posed a threat on the break with debutant Chealsea Daniels spearheading the attack. Bantwana coach Simphiwe Dludlu was proud of her girls after the game and will be hoping for another positive result against Japan.
