FOR four months, residents could not call the police when they needed them! They had to call another cluster or call the cops directly on their cellphones. This was due to cable theft in Lwandle, Strand, Cape Town. It also affected the local museum. Sergeant Mthokozisi Gama of Lwandle police pleaded with residents to help bring the culprits to book. “We are appealing to residents to assist us in arresting the suspects who stole the cables. A case was opened but no arrests have been made.” Gama said the cable theft affected their operations. “We could hardly communicate with other stations other than through emails. We also had to get cellphones for some of our members and not everyone had those numbers,” he said. Gama said they informed the community about the situation through the local radio station and also handed out pamphlets. Lwandle Migrant Museum manager, Masa Soko, said they had to use another service provider, which didn’t use cables, to make connections. “We received several complaints. When people dialled our number, the phone just rang and they thought we were not ignoring calls,” said Masa. Lwandle Policing Forum chairman, Siyabonga Macaula, said the stolen cables negatively affected the community. “Some people were calling with their last airtime and if they had to wait for the call to be diverted, they ran out of airtime,” said Macaula. He said he hoped the matter had been dealt with and would not happen again, especially with the festive season fast approaching.
