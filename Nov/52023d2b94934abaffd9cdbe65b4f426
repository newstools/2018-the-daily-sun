ZANDILE Vilakazi (35) is struggling without an ID. Without the important document, the 35-year-old from Alberton, Ekurhuleni, is unable to get her life back on track. Her Home Affairs horror started when she went to the Germiston branch to apply for a birth certificate for her second born. She got the shock of her life when they told her she shared an ID number with a stranger. “They told me to go where I had attended primary school and get a letter stating I was born in South Africa.” She did as she was told, but all her efforts were in vain. Since then she feels stuck in life, said the mum of two. To Zandile’s surprise, it turned out she never lost her ID in the first place – and neither was it stolen. “I lost my job because of this. I can’t even open a bank account,” she said. As a result, she only gets by doing piece jobs. She had to enrol her son at a private school as he didn’t have a birth certificate. “The school called to tell me they needed my son’s ID number,” she said. Zandile’s worst fear is seeing her kids being in the same situation. “I want to fix this problem now so that my children can have a bright future,” she said Neither of her children receive child support grants. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the provincial manager would contact Zandile.
