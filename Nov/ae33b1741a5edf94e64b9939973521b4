THEY didn’t go home. They just went straight to parties! After writing their last exams, many matric pupils redesigned their school skirts into miniskirts, cut their trousers into shorts and turned T-shirts into crop tops. Daily Sun took to parks in Tshwane kasis on Monday to witness the celebrations. Moipone Thipe (19) saidending 12 years of schooling could not be done quietly. At Small Fountain Park in Soshanguve, Tshwane, music blasted from cars and DJs played for free. Some pretended to faint while others climbed on top of cars and danced their school years away. “Some of our peers will be going to university and this calls for a celebration. “We have been good kids for years. Why can’t we celebrate for one day?” she asked. Resident Matlakala Mpeshe (40) said the matriculants were exposing themselves to danger. She said the park celebrations were a great platform for sugar daddies and drug lords. Pupils at Randfontein High School, Gauteng celebrated in a different way. They donated their school shoes and uniforms to their fellow students as part of their pens down. Since last year, Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi has warned against pens down parties. Lesufi said: “The department asks parents to monitor their children and discourage them from these practices.” He encouraged pupils to donate their school uniforms to be used by those who needed them most.
