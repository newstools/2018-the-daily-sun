SASSA has distanced itself from a notice circulating on social media claiming it is giving away R2 000 grocery vouchers to unemployed South Africans. The notice, which has logos including those of supermarkets, Unicef and the United Nations, requests qualifying citizens to download forms from the government website. They are also asked to give their personal information including ID numbers and to create, specifically, a new Gmail account to send the documents. With Mzansi’s high unemployment rate, it’s no surprise that the notice was widely shared by social media users, with some asking for advice on how they could apply. Themba Ningiza (29) said: “It would be all over the news if it was true. We would have heard people talking about how this would affect the country.” Sassa spokesman Paseka Letsatsi said the agency didn’t offer any financial assistance to unemployed citizens. “We picked up through social media that a mischievous source was seeking to take advantage of our people by spreading such a foolish message,” said Letsatsi. “Sassa would like to warn members of the public not to fall for such bogus notices. “If any changes are made to the social assistance policy, Sassa staff will go out to communities around the country to inform the public about such impending changes.”
