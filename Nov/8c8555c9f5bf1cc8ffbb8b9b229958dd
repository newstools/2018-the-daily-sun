FIVE people were bust during a fight between residents and police in Bo-Kaap on Tuesday. Residents blocked roads, causing big traffic jams in the city centre, while they protested against property developers in their area. About 50 protesters took to the streets to block traffic in Buitengracht Street on Tuesday afternoon. Cops used stun grenades to break them up. “Four men and a woman between the ages of 22 and 43 were arrested for breaking a court order and later released on bail,” said police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana. Their protest was about the two cranes trying to enter Lion Street to continue building flats for property developer Blok. The company bought the site last March and the city approved the development of 56 residential units. Since construction started in April, people have held protests, saying the place is part of their heritage. “This protest was started by the community at large. We do not want the development to carry on,” said Bo-Kaap Civic and Ratepayers’ Association spokeswoman Mishkah Samie. Drivers stuck in traffic were not happy. Businessman Leonard Chiza (33) said: “I have been here for an hour because people are blocking this busy road. I had to cancel an important appointment!” According to the property company’s statement, only a small group is fighting the development. “A small, self-interested group illegally interfered with deliveries and there is a court order in place to prevent further interference by this group and not the whole community,” it said.
