JACOB de Bruyn was over the moon when he was told he would be getting an RDP. He gathered people to help him and they demolished the four-roomed asbestos house he had built, to make space for his new RDP in Extension 24 Nellmapius near Mamelodi. But then he got the shock of his life when the municipality suddenly told him he didn’t qualify for the house and that the promise made to him was a mistake! The 48-year-old father of four has now rented a backroom as there is not enough space for his family and their furniture in a two-roomed shack they built. His wife is also not speaking to him because she blames him for all the chaos. Jacob told Daily Sun that while his old house was built with asbestos and was not quite like a brick house, it provided shelter for his family. He said the house cost him more than R70 000 to build. “My children had their own bedroom, there was a kitchen and a living area. We were happy,” he said. Jacob said he was now the laughing stock of the community. “They have to replace my house before I sue them,” he said. City of Tshwane’s regional executive director Sello Chipu said RDPs are built for people who earn less than R3 500. He said Jacob should bring a report to the municipality with the names of those who instructed him to demolish his house.
