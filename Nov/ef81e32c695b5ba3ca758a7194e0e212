LIMPOPO leaders visited murdered councillor Thabang Maupa’s family yesterday. Community Safety MEC Makoma Makhurupetje and Co-operative Governance MEC Jerry Ndou said the killing was an attack on the government. The 40-year-old was killed on Monday in Riba Cross outside Burgersfort. Maupa, who was a councillor at Fetakgomo-Greater Tubatse Municipality, spoke out against the municipality’s investment of millions with VBS Bank. His family said robbery wasn’t the motive as the gunmen had taken none of his belongings. Limpopo police have offered a R100 000 reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for the murder. Joseph Maupa said his brother was very vocal about corruption at the local mines and the municipality. “He was living in fear these past two weeks.” Makhurupetje said they heard councillors in the area were being targeted for being vocal about corruption. “Don’t just share any information on the street. “Tell police so the culprits are arrested.” She said police had put together a multidisciplinary committee and intelligence team, as the case was being tackled at provincial level. Anyone with info should call Colonel Makhathini Ngele at 082 573 3645 and 08600 10111, or SMS 32211.
