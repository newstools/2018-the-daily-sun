QUICK action by cops saw three thugs lose most of their loot and one of them bust. Police spokesman Constable Maselela Langa said a woman (39) had just withdrawn R29 000 when she was approached by armed thugs, who robbed her. Their happiness was short-lived as cops tracked them down and bust one of them. Langa said the incident happened in Bultfontein, Free State, on Monday afternoon. Langa told Daily Sun: “The victim had withdrawn the money from inside the bank when she was robbed outside by three men in a Volkswagen Polo GT with a North West registration plate. “An activation plan was implemented and farmers of Bultfontein spotted the car and alerted cops. A chase ensued and the suspects were cornered. Two armed suspects are still at large. “We urge the community to alert cops when they are spotted. A large amount of cash was found but the gun was not recovered.” Langa said the Polo was a stolen car. “The arrested suspect (22) was charged with armed robbery and will appear in court soon.”
