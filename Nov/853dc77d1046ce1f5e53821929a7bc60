THE smell of sewage is the order of the day in this kasi. Two families who live on Nagpur Road in Ladysmith, northern KZN, said their yards were flooded. The kak water is being caused by a blocked drain near their houses. They told Daily Sun the drain became clogged up two months ago. They reported the problem many times to the municipality, but nothing has happened. Nokulunga Khoza (38) said the smell was terrible. “We’re forced to close our doors and windows all the time,” she said. Thabile Mantoor (37) said they’d informed their ward councillor because the municipality was ignoring them. “We can’t continue living like this. This is not fair on us,” said Thabile. “Something needs to be done to fix the blocked drain.” Councillor Abbas Warasally said: “I’ve tried to solve this matter and even brought in officials from the water and sanitation department to assess the damage, but nothing happened.” Jabulani Mkhonza, a spokesman for the Uthukela Municipality, said: “We’ve investigated the blockage. The reason behind the problem is that objects are thrown in the drain. “A pump was damaged and we couldn’t find replacement parts. We have to replace it, but it will take time.”
