HE wants to become a big TV star, but an ex may just ruin his future! Phuti Seboni (24) from Kempton Park in Ekurhuleni claimed the ex was making life difficult for him. The actor and singer said she’d been sending him threatening messages. She’d also said bad things about him on social media. “She’s the one who broke up with me, but now she’s making my life a misery,” he claimed. “My biggest fear is that the girl might have a negative influence on my acting and singing career.” He’s had small roles on shows such as Skeem Saam. “I know I have the potential to go far,” he said. He changed his number a few times, but she still kept calling him. “She uses different phones and I block them every day,” he said. Phuti said he feared the woman might do something dangerous. “She’s acting like a crazy person. She told people I stink and called me names. “Now people don’t respect me. I’ve tried speaking to her, but the problem won’t go away.” When Daily Sun contacted the ex-girlfriend, she dropped the call. On the second attempt her phone was switched off.
