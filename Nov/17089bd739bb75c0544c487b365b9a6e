MINKI Makgabane says she has had sleepless nights for the past three years because of her loud neighbours. The 50-year-old from FineTown in Ennerdale, south of Joburg, said she gets barely two nights of sleep a week. She said she knew DJ Maphorisa’s hit single, Makhe, word for word. “They play it all the time. Once they hear a new song, they can play it the whole day.” Minki said she tried to talk to her neighbours, but nothing changed. She said she had given up because her neighbours take her for a fool. “A woman was beaten up by her boyfriend and we could not hear her screams because of the loud music. “That yard is no different to a shebeen,” said Minki. “It is chaos. “They just do the same thing over and over,” she said. The SunTeam spoke to Mahape Khothane (32), who lives in the noisy house. “Most of the people renting shacks in my uncle’s yard are employed and hardly at home during the day. “Some weekends get hectic, but Minki does not talk to us nicely,” he said. “She is on bad terms with most of her neighbours. “The situation really is not that bad. “She is blowing things out of proportion.”
