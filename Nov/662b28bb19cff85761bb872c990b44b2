MILLIONS of Mzansi people who own cars work as Uber operators. Uber has allowed many to make extra money from their cars but the ride-hailing app providers also have strict standards regarding who can be a driver. Michelle Bell, operations manager of ABT Logistics, a support company for Uber operators, said: “Anyone interested in becoming an Uber operator should buy a car from 2014 or newer.” “Your vehicle also determines your ride category. “UberX is the most popular but there’s also UberXL and UberVAN – great help when travelling with more than four people.” UberX, which is available in Joburg, Pretoria, Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth, requires a four-door sedan that must seat at least four passengers as well as the driver and it must have a 1,4-litre or bigger engine. George Mienie, CEO of AutoTrader, added that Uber cars must be in good condition, the windows must work and it must have air-conditioning. Salvaged or rebuilt cars are not allowed but a used car in good condition is absolutely fine. “Select a car with very low mileage because your car will be driven all day, every day.” He said while the Toyota Corolla Quest and Volkswagen Polo Vivo are the most popular UberX choices, there are other options too. “You need a car that is reliable and fuel efficient. “Parts should be readily available from dealers who provide good service – you do not want your car off the road waiting for imported parts to arrive.” Toyota Etios, Honda Brio and Nissan Almera are considered the best cars for Uber. Ford Focus and Mazda3 are also good choices but the Honda Accord and Suzuki Ciaz are worth considering too. Bell said: “The five best options ifor UberVan are the Volkswagen Kombi, Hyundai H-1, Mercedes-Benz Viano or Vito and Opel Vivaro. They are quality vans with outstanding dealer support.”
