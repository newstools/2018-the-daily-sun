THE drama at Endumeni Municipality in Dundee, northern KZN, is far from over. Soon after the dramatic election of ANC speaker Lucky Khumalo and IFP mayor Thabani Mlotshwa on Friday, the new coalition placed municipal manager Siyabonga Ntuli on suspension. Ntuli was handed a letter on Monday and asked to explain within seven days why he should not be suspended. He is accused of taking instructions from the IFP national leadership who wanted to dictate which councillors should be elected as mayor and speaker. Khumalo said Ntuli had sabotaged the council, and as the new municipal leadership they could not work with him. “He has to respond to us by Tuesday. Even if he doesn’t respond, we’ll take action because we would have followed procedure,” said Khumalo, who was supported by local IFP leaders. Regional spokesman Xolani Msezane said they supported the council’s decision to suspend Ntuli. A source at the municipality said Ntuli’s bodyguard fired shots in the air after municipal guards tried to prevent him from entering his office on Monday. Meanwhile, Msezane said the IFP national leadership had apparently accepted the party was now working with the ANC. This comes after the party sent a letter of dismissal to mayor Mlotshwa on Monday morning but withdrew it in the afternoon. The IFP had proposed Siyabonga Ndlovu as mayor, but the ANC put forward Mlotshwa’s name and he accepted. This angered IFP councillors and they staged a walkout. Mlotshwa stayed and helped the ANC by becoming the seventh councillor to pass resolutions. Nsikayezwe Cebekhulu IFP said the party withdrew Mlotshwa’s dismissal letter and accepted him as mayor, although working with the ANC was not approved by national leadership.
