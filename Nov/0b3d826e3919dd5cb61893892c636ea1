DR MOIPONE Tlapu is putting the lives of drug addicts first. She is the director of the Training, Learning and Rehabilitation Centre in Maboloka Village in Brits, North West. Tlapu will host a mental health awareness event on 24 November. “The good thing about the event is that we’ve also invited recovering depression and drug abuse addicts,” Tlapu told Daily Sun. “They will be sharing their life experiences and educating people. “We want to reach out to people in the community. “There’s a high number of drug abuse, suicide and depression cases. “We feel that we’re making a difference and closing the gap that the department of health is battling to address.” She said they’ve been helping drug addicts by identifying and referring them to various rehab centres in Gauteng.
