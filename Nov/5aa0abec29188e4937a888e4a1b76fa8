GOGO Sembathekile Mafuleka (64) cried tears of joy when she was given a key to her new four-roomed house. The gogo from Lindizwe Village in Ngwavuma, northern KZN, had been living in a one-roomed, crumbling rondavel with her seven grandkids. Sembathekile, having lived in the rondavel for 20 years, had never been so excited in her entire life. “When I first came to the area from Swaziland many years ago, I had nothing. I built one rondavel and moved in with my family.” Over the years life became tough when her unemployed kids started having children of their own. “We were forced to share a one-roomed rondavel.” It became worse when it rained and when the weather was really bad. Heavy rain and strong winds often damaged her rondavel. “From time to time we’d fix it because we didn’t have money to build a new one. “Now that Councillor Mandla Ndlela and Zisize Educational Foundation official have come to our rescue, I’m so excited and will forever be grateful.” Hlengiwe Mthimkhulu, an official from the foundation, said despite being an organisation that focuses on educational programmes for the youth in the area, they were shocked when they learnt about gogo’s plight. “We decided to make a difference in gogo’s life. “We built her a proper house so she could earn back her dignity.” She said they were determined to help other residents in a similar situation. Ndlela said: “I treated the matter with a sense of urgency when I discovered the family’s living conditions. “I’m happy that gogo will finally sleep in a proper house.”
