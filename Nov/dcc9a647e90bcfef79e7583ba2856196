Xenowatch, a tool that monitors xenophobic attacks across the country, have been launched. Wits University’s African Centre for Migration and Society, with the Save the Children NGO, launched Xenowatch in Greenside extension 44 outside Polokwane a few days ago. Activists, victims and observers can report attacks through the app, an SMS, e-mail or WhatsApp message. The tool requires informers to include information such as the location of the incident, when and where it happened and a short description of what took place. Users also have the option of attaching photos and videos of the incident. Informers are guaranteed anonymity. Researcher Jean Misago said the Xenowatch reports would be verified and passed on to the police. He said Xenowatch would collect information and use interactive mapping techniques that will allow the public to monitor attacks. “It’s worrying to see immigrants being violated and killed for no reason. “It’s crucial that we respect each other because foreigners’ profits play a huge role in the country’s economy,” he said. Save the Children project manager Nyika Machenjedze said: “This is a preventative measure that can be used to create peace. “We believe informed communities are empowered ones. “We hope our children will be protected.” In the event of an emergency, members of the public are advised to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
