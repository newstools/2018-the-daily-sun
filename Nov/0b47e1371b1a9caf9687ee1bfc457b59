OVER the years, many people have had serious problems
trying to get their IDs from what many calls Horror Affairs. However, the home affairs department now says the public
is taking too long to collect their ID smart cards. The department recently revealed they were facing a
massive challenge ahead of next year’s general election as close to 410 000
smart cards remained uncollected at offices around the country. Soweto regional Home Affairs manager Pearl Poto said
close to 2 000 smart cards were lying at Orlando West Home Affairs. She said
the department was calling on people who were eligible to vote to collect their
IDs. She said the IEC had set aside 26 and 27 January to allow
first time voters to register and existing voters to update and check their
registration details. “This means if you don’t have a valid ID card, you won’t
be able to vote. The difficulty with these smart ID cards is that people need
to visit Home Affairs for them to be registered, activated and linked with
biometric information,” said Poto. She urged residents to collect their IDs or apply for new
ones. Meanwhile, Home Affairs announced on Thursday that over
180 000 Zimbabweans had applied for Zimbabwean Exemption Permits (ZEP). Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Makgola explained the ZEP
was meant to regularise the stay of Zimbabweans in the country for work, study
and business. “Applications for the ZEP were announced in September
last year following the expiry of the Zimbabwean Special Permit,” he said.
