POLICE officers wanted to lead a squatter camp in prayer, but the residents had no time for them. They said: “We don’t need prayers – we need action!” Residents of Angelo squatter camp in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, gave police the cold shoulder on Wednesday. The residents said they woke up to the sight of a corpse almost every day. The cops told the community they were doing everything in their power to fight crime, but said they could not win the battle alone. Constable Ntsako Ledwaba of Boksburg Police Station said people should not underestimate the power of prayer. “Only God can make things happen. We need to call on Him,” he said. “We do not need to fill up this church. “All we need are a few people who can pray.” But residents refused to budge. “We don’t want anything to do with their church. “Some things don’t need God’s intervention,” said a resident. “They must increase police visibility instead of telling us to pray. “They should meet us at the local soccer field instead of at the church.” Only a handful of residents attended the prayer session. Pastor Lucky Nhlabathi said: “Lord, our cops tried everything in their power to fight crime but they cannot do it on their own. “Please intervene. The crime rate in this area is high.” Residents said thugs took advantage of the fact that there were no street lights in the area. “People die like flies here,” said one. Whether you are at home or in the streets, you still get targeted. “We do not know where to run,” said the resident. “The police can call on God for help, but before the end of the day someone is going to die.”
