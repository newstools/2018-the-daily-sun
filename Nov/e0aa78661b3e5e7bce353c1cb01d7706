Award-winning British actor, Idris Elba has been named the 2018 Sexiest Man Alive by People Magazine USA. The 46-year-old actor replaces American country singer, Blake Shelton who held the title in 2017. Idris is the 33rd Hollywood celeb to hold this title after People magazine has been awarding it every year since 1985 when Mel Gibson received the first honour. Fans have been going crazy on social media since the news broke this week because for years now, there’s been an unofficial movement to have the magazine recognize Idris as the sexiest man on earth. He told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show this past Monday that he felt honoured to be given this title. "But to be honest, it was just a nice feeling. It was a nice surprise—an ego boost for sure,” he said. “Thank you so much People Magazine for making me sexiest man in the world, it is an honour [and] my mom is gonna be very, very proud,” he continued. Idris is known for his work on movies and television series like American Gangster, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, Thor: The Dark World, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, Avengers: Infinity War, Law & Order, and CSI: Miami.
