THE Skukuza Regional Court has sentenced Patrick Nkuna to 33 years
in jail for rhino poaching. SanParks spokesperson Isaac Phaahla said Nkuna was arrested in
2015 in the Kruger National Park, in an anti-poaching operation. Nkuna was charged with 12 counts, including four counts of
attempted murder, trespassing in a National park and possession of an illegal
firearm. Shortly before his arrest, Nkuna and his accomplices attempted to
shoot at a SANParks helicopter involved in the follow up operation. The Managing Executive of KNP, Glenn Phillips commended the court
for sending a clear message and imposing such a stiff jail term. “This is a huge victory and deterrence factor in the ongoing
anti-poaching campaign. We warmly welcome this ruling as it will provide the much needed
boost to the anti-poaching teams who endure harsh conditions for the protection
of our parks,” Phillips said. Phillips said he wishes to see a significant increase in such
convictions and for the law enforcement authorities in affected countries to
cooperate and work with them to end this scourge.
