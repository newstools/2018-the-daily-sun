THE three-storey shack is a well-known landmark in Mbekweni, Paarl. And with seven rooms on the bottom floor, 14 on the second and six on the top floor, there is plenty of room for Rastas to visit. Phumelele “Juda” Ngqoshela (40) said he started building the Rasta hotel with a friend 20 years ago. “We wanted Rastafarians to have a place where they could enjoy being themselves,” he said. They named the shack Twelve Tribe Shelter. More than 10 people live in the shack, but Juda said all Rastas were welcome to stay as long as they wanted. “This is their home. They can stay here as long as they behave.” Irvin Siza (27) from Cape Town said he loved to chill with other Rastas. “I enjoy being here. The atmosphere is good and I feel at home,” said Irvin. Nolusindiso Ntsalu (37) said the spot used to be a hot spot for criminals. “These Rastas did a great job by occupying that space. “Now we are safe and they sell fresh fruit and vegetables,” she said. The Rastas said the reason people all over the world were killing each other was because of the meat they ate. “We do not mind teaching people how to live a clean life without killing animals,” said Juda.
