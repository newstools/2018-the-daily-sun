WHEN Papi Moilwa gave a lift to two women he found running along a road he thought he was doing a good deed. But he ended up almost getting hijacked and beaten for his effort. The 47-year-old from Phelindaba kasi in Mangaung told Daily Sun he was driving home from a friend’s place on Monday when he spotted the women. “I saw two women running and I thought they were in danger. I stopped the car to ask what was going on and they asked for a lift. I did not hesitate to say yes,” he said. “They told me they were going to Freedom Square, but when I approached the intersection where they were supposed to get off, they became violent and forced me to drive in another direction. “I refused and one of them grabbed my car keys while the other one jumped out of the car and started hitting it with bricks. “When I overpowered her friend, she also started damaging my car with bricks. “I kept fighting and managed to run to a nearby tavern. We called the police, and when they arrived I was bleeding while the two women were locked in the tavern.” Papi said he was very disappointed because the cops did not arrest the two women after he told them what had happened. “I was taken to hospital because my upper lip was bleeding and I had scratches on my hands,” he said. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said: “The man must go to the nearest police station and talk to the station commander to open a case.”
