THOKOZILE Gwala is an angry gogo. The 61-year-old from Standerton, Mpumalanga said Home Affairs made her two years younger. Now she’s battling to get her pension grant because of an incorrect age. According to Home Affairs, gogo Thokozile is younger than her twin sister by two years. She said she wanted the department to fix her ID so that she could get her pension grant, just like her sister. Gogo said she had tried many times to get the problem fixed, but with no success. “I just want the Home Affairs officials to fix this problem because I’m forced to keep on working even though I’m sick.” She said even though she went with her elder brother to Home Affairs, she still wasn’t helped. Instead, she was told to bring her baptism certificate, which she doesn’t have. “My sister and I were born in 1957 but my ID says I was born in 1959,” said gogo. “I’ve been trying to fix the problem since five years ago, but had no success. “I can’t even find my baptism certificate because my late parents never showed it to me,” gogo Thokozile said. Thabo Mokgola, a spokesman for Home Affairs, said id the matter had been referred to the provincial manager for investigation. “The manager will send officials to contact gogo and gather more evidence to sort this out.”
