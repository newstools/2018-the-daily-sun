Hot air hand dryers in bathrooms have been found to spread faecal germs onto hands. The results were published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology. Plates that were exposed to hand dryer air for 30 seconds averaged 18-60 colonies per plate, but the interior hand dryer nozzle surfaces had minimal bacterial levels. However, plates that were exposed to bathroom air for 2 minutes with hand dryers off, averaged 1 colony, and plates exposed to bathroom air moved by a small fan for 20 minutes had averages of 15 and 12 colonies per plate. According to the research, potential human pathogens were recovered from plates exposed to hand dryer air whether or not a HEPA filter was present. These results indicate that many kinds of bacteria, including potential pathogens and spores, can be deposited on hands exposed to bathroom hand dryers. The spores could be dispersed throughout buildings and deposited on hands by hand dryers. “Importance while there is evidence that bathroom hand dryers can disperse bacteria from hands or deposit bacteria on surfaces, including recently washed hands, there is less information on the organisms dispersed by hand dryers,” the authors said. The authors say if hand dryers provide a reservoir of bacteria or simply blow large amounts of bacterially contaminated air. The study authors suggest that using paper towels is much better.
