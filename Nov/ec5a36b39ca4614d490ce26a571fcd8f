RESIDENTS of Pietermaritzburg yesterday marched from Ashdown Stadium to Plessislaer Police Station. The residents want Police Minister Bheki Cele to investigate the cop shop. Councillor Dumisani Phungula said: “We are not happy with how they handle serious cases. “The level of crime in the area has increased at a shocking rate over the past few years, but we do not see cops doing anything about the matter,” he said. Phungula said the murder of rape victim and state witness Lindelwa Bowes (18) two weeks ago was the final straw. Lindelwa was shot in her bedroom, allegedly with a gun fitted with a silencer. “It was known that her life was in danger, but Plessislaer police took forever to put her into a witness protection programme,” said Phungula. He said before Lindelwa’s murder, 10 other state witnesses in the area were also murdered. A resident said: “We are sick of these cops. “They fail to ensure we are safe, yet they are employed to do that.” Station commander Brigadier Mandla Shezi accepted the residents’ memorandum. He said police were happy to see residents make an effort to put their concerns on the table. Shezi said: “We promise we are going to do our best to protect you. “Whatever complaints you have about our service, we are going to pass them on to our superiors.”
