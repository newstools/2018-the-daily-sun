CONVICTED racist and former estate agent Vicki Momberg is appealing
her conviction. Momberg is appealing the sentence at the South Gauteng High
Court. She was sentenced to three years in prison, and 1 year was
suspended for a period of three years on condition that she does not commit a
similar crime. Momberg was found guilty of four counts of crimen injuria
for calling a black cop a K****R. This happened when the cop was trying to assist her following
a smash-and-grab incident. She was released on R2 000 bail by the Randburg Magistrate's
Court in August, pending the outcome of her appeal. State prosecutor Yusuf Baba decided not to oppose bail
following a discussion with Momberg's lawyer Kingdom Onah. No bail conditions were set. SOURCE: NEWS24
