PARENTS and teachers at Mzomusha Primary School in Msinga, KZN Midlands, are disappointed. They’ve been fighting a losing battle with the education department. They want three classrooms, which were damaged by heavy rain in September last year, to be fixed. Nathi Sokhela, chairman of the SGB, said: “The principal reported the matter to the Umzinyathi education district several times, but nothing is being done.” He said the situation had forced teachers to work under difficult conditions. “Teachers start teaching at 6am so that they’ll be able to take turns teaching in the classrooms that were not affected by heavy rain. “As parents, it does not sit well with us that our kids have to be at school at 6am. It’s not fair on our kids.” A teacher said they had asked the principal to request mobile classrooms from the district while they were waiting for the roof to be fixed. “But that didn’t happen,” said the teacher. They had to teach some of the 855 pupils under trees. “When it rains we’re forced to send some of the kids home because we can’t make them wait for their turn. “When it’s too hot we’re forced to teach kids under trees.” KZN Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said: “Mzomusha Primary is not the only school that was damaged. “Several others were also severely damaged. “It was a natural disaster the department didn’t invite. We’re requesting that they bear with us. “We can’t fix all the schools at once due to financial constraints.”
