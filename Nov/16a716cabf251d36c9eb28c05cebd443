TEBOGO Thai saw a man assaulting a woman at the kasi tavern at the weekend and didn’t like it. The 33-year-old from Bekkersdal, Gauteng confronted the abuser but ended up being stabbed himself. Tebogo said the man told him he wanted to teach him a lesson and that he shouldn’t interfere in things that didn’t concern him. But the brave Tebogo wasn’t afraid to protect the women. “There are men who just don’t know how to treat women. “If a woman makes you angry, just walk away,” Tebogo told Daily Sun. “You don’t beat a woman, even the Bible forbids that. “Why should men be quick to beat their women instead of resolving issues peacefully. Men must stop attacking defenceless women.” Tebogo has since become popular in the kasi. Women won’t stop praising him for protecting a woman at the tavern. Sara Dikwena told the People’s Paper: “We need men like Tebogo to protect women. Men forget that they’re not created the same as women. “Can you imagine a defenceless woman being attacked by a man? “We were at the tavern when the incident happened and were relieved when Tebogo came to the woman’s defence.” Tebogo opened a case against his attacker. The man was arrested. Police spokesman Sergeant Linkie Lefakane confirmed that a case of assault has been opened.
