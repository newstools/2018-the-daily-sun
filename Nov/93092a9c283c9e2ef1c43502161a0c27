BOITSHOKO Moeng’s mum wants justice. The 26-year-old was brutally murdered, allegedly by her boyfriend. Violet Moeng was speaking outside the Bafokeng Magistrates Court in Tlhabane, North West. Accused Thabo Dire (30) made a brief appearance yesterday. Violet (55) said her daughter’s death had left her heartbroken. “The boyfriend called me at about 2am,” she claimed. “I advised him to call the police.” Violet claimed her daughter had filed two protection orders against the accused. “The child I brought up changed because of the abuse she suffered,” she told the People’s Paper. “There was a time when I thought she would go crazy because of the abuse.” She said the law must take its course. Boitshoko died after she allegedly had an argument with her boyfriend outside a tavern in Lethabong. Dire is accused of hitting her with rocks until she died. The murder case was postponed to 26 November.
