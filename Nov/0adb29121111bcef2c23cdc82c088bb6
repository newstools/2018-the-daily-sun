THERE’s a cool R10 000 up for grabs for anyone who can help catch these wanted robbers. This is after an armed robbery took place on 6 November at the Barko Financial Services Benoni branch in Woburn Street. It happened at about 9am, a few minutes after the branch opened. BFS investigator Pieter van Dyk said the robbers entered the branch disguised as clients who wanted to enquire about a loan. “A few minutes later, they showed their true colours,” said Van Dyk. He told Daily Sun that after the two suspects enquired about a loan, they stood up and took out handguns. They demanded money from staff. “Luckily, no one was injured but people lost money and their cellphones,” said Van Dyk. He said an undisclosed amount of cash was handed to the two suspects and they fled the scene. He confirmed that a case of business robbery was opened with the police and that a R10 000 reward per suspect was offered for information that would lead to their arrests. Anyone with information should contact Van Dyk on 071 353 3948.
