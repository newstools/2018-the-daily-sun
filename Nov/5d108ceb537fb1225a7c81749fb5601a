IDOLS winner Yanga Sobetwa is a tiny girl with big dreams! After being named the Idols SA Season 14 winner of R1 million, Yanga shared her plans for the future. Speaking after the ceremony at Carnival City in Ekurhuleni, the 17-year-old from Cape Town said: “I plan to continue my studies. I’m a books girl and have many skills I want to fulfil, like learning entertainment law. “I’m planning on freezing the money for about a year and living on money from gigs.” She plans to get a doctor’s degree in music and start her own production company and music academy. She tried hard to stay humble. “I don’t deserve to be here. I feel very blessed and privileged,” she said. After spending a lot of time together during the competition, the top two contestants, Yanga and runner-up Thato Makape, have the same dreams. “It was my aim to uplift Postmasburg in the Northern Cape, as small as it is, and the young stars in the area who aren’t using their talent,” said Thato. He said he also had a vision to start an academy, not just in music but in the arts, which would be a platform for locals to showcase their skills. Even though he came second, Thato was happy. “The runner-up who was second out of thousands of people is also winner,” he said. Yanga said: “Thato and I were not so close at the beginning of the competition. “But as it went on I got to know him more.” She said it had been nice to know him and he was a great guy and deserved to be in the finals. Thato said: “Kindness and love will take you far. That’s why Yanga and I ended up being like brother and sister. “I’ll start my continental tour in April.”
