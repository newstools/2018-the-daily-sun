“RAPE is undeniably degrading and dehumanising.” This were the words of Judge Cassim Moosa during the
sentencing of Quantum Rapist Gift Lebogang Mokoena. Mokoena (28) was sentenced in the South Gauteng High
Court, sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate Court on Thursday. He used to kidnap, rape and rob female passengers across
parts of Gauteng while driving around in a white Toyota Quantum minibus taxi. He raped a total of 8 women. He was sentenced to 12 life terms plus 345 years in
prison.  Last month, the 28-year-old pleaded guilty to 13 counts
of rape‚ nine of kidnapping‚ nine of robbery with aggravating circumstances‚
one of sexual assault and nine of pointing an object that looked like a
firearm. Lebogang called his cousin Themba Mokoena to testify in
his mitigation of sentence. Themba told the court that Lebogang used to pick him up
in a taxi and they would drive around.  He said he was shocked when he heard he was bust for rape
as he was an honest, good guy. He said Lebogang dropped out of school in grade
9. “He spent most of his school hours washing taxis and
later became a taxi driver,” said Themba. Lebogang’s reign of terror lasted between September 2016
and October last year. He confessed to being part of a three-man gang which
kidnapped‚ raped and robbed women commuters across Gauteng in what was then
known as the Quantum taxi rapes.  He said the incidents occurred in Soweto‚ Booysens‚
Vosloorus and Orange Farm. Judge Cassim Moosa said society is imploring the courts
to impose harsher sentences to crimes committed against women and children. He says taxis are vital mode of transport and many people
use them going to work and school Moosa said there's no another appropriate sentence to be
imposed on the accused other than life sentence
