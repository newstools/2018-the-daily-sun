A VIRAL video of high school pupils smoking dagga through an apple could get them suspended. The video, which was filmed in May, started doing the rounds on Monday. It shows six pupils from Navalsig High School in Bloemfontein smoking dagga while in uniform. The pupils told the SunTeam they were shocked when the video started being shared on social media. “That incident happened in winter and we had already forgotten about it. Now we might get suspended from school,” said a pupil. Free State Education spokesman Howard Ndaba confirmed the incident and said the SGB would hold a disciplinary hearing. “Five of these pupils are still under the compulsory schoolgoing age. The incident took place in May and, therefore, does not warrant immediate suspension due to the exam period,” he said. “The pupils were given letters inviting their parents to the hearing but they will continue writing their exams. “The school is already working with the Mangaung One Stop Child Justice Centre to support three of the pupils.” Ndaba said the children were aged between 16 and 17 and were in grades 8 and 9. “A school safety programme will be rolled out to support not only the affected pupils, but the whole school. The department would like to remind people not to distribute the video as it is a criminal offence to circulate explicit images of minors. The innocence of minors is a constitutional priority.”
