A FARMER'S goat has given birth to a strange
"half-pig half-human" creature. Villagers in the Philippines were scared that the animal
is cursed and will bring them bad luck. Josephine Repique, 40, said the pregnant goat went into
labour earlier this month at her smallholding in Sultan Kudarat in the
Philippines. The two babies had to be removed by caesarean section -
sparking shrieks of horror when one of the strange-looking animals emerged. Josephine said the kid ''looked like a pig, with a mix of
human''. The small furless animal even had what looked like a
naval. She was quoted by The Sun saying: ''We were shocked. We
can't explain how it looks like that. All our neighbours flocked into our house
to get a good look.'' Sadly, the two infants and the mother goat all died,
sparking fears among villagers that the creature was a cursed ''mutant devil''
that brought bad luck. Josephine added: ''Nobody knows what it is, but it's not
a goat. It's scary. "We're all wondering why it happened and if it is
bad luck.'' Dr Agapita Salces of the Institute of Animal Science of
the University of the Philippines said the foetus appeared to have suffered a
genetic mutation in the womb. He added: "It is also possible that the mother
contracted a disease called Rift Valley fever from mosquito bites and this
caused the impaired development of the infant.''
