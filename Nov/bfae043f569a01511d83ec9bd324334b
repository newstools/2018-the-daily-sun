MZANSI is divided over questions about DA chief whip John Steenhuisen’s qualifications. The DA’s proposed minimum requirements for holding public office would see Steenhuisen demoted to a backbencher. Many people on social media were shocked to learn Steenhuisen only has matric. Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, an EFF MP and national spokesman, tweeted: “If he were a black leader, this article would have even published his matric results.” Ndlozi called it white privilege. DA MP Dean Macpherson tweeted: “I’ve known Steenhuisen for 10 years. He’s taught me everything I know in politics. “Honesty, hard work, accountability, knowing your subject matter, dedication to the party and the country – no degree can teach you that. SA and the DA is a better place because of people like John.” DA leader Mmusi Maimane said: “I’ve worked with a great legislator, a chief whip and a friend. “He’s the finest chief whip of the opposition in parliament. “A constitutionalist and a fierce defender of freedom,” said Maimane. But Twitter recalled how people such as Julius Malema and Jacob Zuma were slammed for having no qualifications. Malema has since obtained an honours degree in philosophy from Unisa. Many said it was hypocritical of Steenhuisen to be at the forefront of attacks on people such as Hlaudi Motsoeneng and Zuma. Steenhuisen defended himself against the EFF, tweeting: “For all your degrees and qualifications you’re still a bunch of VBS looters and thugs.”
