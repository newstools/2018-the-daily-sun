Muhsin Ertugral has resigned as Ajax Cape Town head coach the club has confirmed. This comes after a 2-1 defeat to Witbank Spurs on Saturday. The result saw the Urban Warriors slip to eighth position in the National First Division standings after eleven games. The Turkish born coach had previously expressed his desire to leave his position as head coach of the Cape Town club, however, the club convinced him to stay on. He took over Ajax Cape Town in December 2017 with the club in a precarious position on the PSL standings. He failed to save the Urban Wrriors from relagation to the NFD. “We wish Muhsin well in all his future endeavours and thank him for his efforts over the past 11 months," CEO Ari Efstathiou told the club website, "his commitment to the club is unquestionable especially when he offered to stay on at the club and help the team in their quest to be promoted back to the Absa Premiership.” Ajax Cape Town will be making an announcement on the new head coach soon.
