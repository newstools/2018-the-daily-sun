The
Mopani District Municipality has been granted an R84 million drought relief
fund.  Mopani spokesperson Witness Tiva said the district municipality previously
approached the national department for funding to put in place further water infrastructure. "The shortage of water in some parts of the district has worsened after
dam levels at ten of our major dams dropped significantly due to drought. The
dam levels are currently between seven and 28 percent," Tiva said. He said they have already stopped extracting water from the Modjadji and
Thapane dams that are found in the Greater Letaba Municipal area due to
drought. This dire situation has prompted the Mopani District Municipality Council to approve
the imposing of water restrictions across the five local municipalities due to
low dam levels. Tiva said a team of engineers and technicians has been deployed to the
five local municipalities to make an assessment and ensure that the actual work
of drilling boreholes starts. “Identified dysfunctional boreholes will also be equipped during the process,”
Tiva said.
