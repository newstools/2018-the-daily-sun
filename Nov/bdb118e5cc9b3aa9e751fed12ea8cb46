GOSPEL Stars were expecting an easy win over The Pastors but they were in for a surprise! The Gospel Stars arrived at the sports ground full of energy, chanting slogans, clapping hands and dancing. Clearly they were ready for a big win but what happened on the pitch didn’t line up with their expectations. The soccer match between the Gospel Stars and The Pastors was played at Holly Park in Durban on Sunday. The artists were shocked by the pastors, who played as if their lives depended on it and the score board told the facts. The pastors won 4-2 on penalties. The soccer match was part of the SABC Crown Gospel Music Awards. The awards will be held at Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban this coming Sunday where the queens and kings of gospel will be crowned. Gospel stars Dumi Mkokstad and Jumbo Nyangiwe impressed with their skills but they faded later in the match. Babo Ngcobo spent less than ten minutes on the pitch before complaining of exhaustion. Pastor Khaya Mbeki scored a goal in the first minutes of the second half but Gospel Stars’ Lindelani Mkhize equalised and the game went to penalties. Pastor Mbatha said they wanted to show the artists their lives were about preaching and praying but they also liked to have fun. “We go to gym, we watch soccer and sometimes we play it. I don’t know why the artists thought they were going to beat us,” said Mbatha. Mkokstad said: “We took the pastors for granted but they proved us wrong.”
