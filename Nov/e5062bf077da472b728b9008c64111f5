ABDUL Aziiz’s spaza had been burgled once before. So when he went to mosque for prayers, he asked Allah to keep his business safe. Just after saying “So be it, Allah”, the 36-year-old spaza shop owner received a call. A suspect had been bust by the Bekkersdal community, west of Joburg, while trying to break in. “I rushed to my shop and found people gathered after they had arrested the suspect. “I thank Allah for fighting for me. I hope next time these thugs will look the other way and not target my shop again.” Residents gave the suspect a few lashes and handed him over to cops. Abdul wasn’t aware while praying and asking for safety that his prayers would be answered. Resident Thabo Sehume said he was walking past the shop when he saw a man trying to break in. “He was trying to force the backdoor open,” said Thabo. “I asked him what he was doing but he couldn’t answer me. “I called the residents and we caught him while he was trying to run away. “We’re tired of these thugs who think they’re entitled to our things. “He’s lucky that we only gave him a few lashes.” Bekkerdal police spokeswoman Sergeant Linkie Lefakane confirmed the arrest. She said the suspect was arrested for possession of break-in implements and attempted business robbery. “The suspect will appear in the Westonaria Magistrates Court soon.”
