WHEN a mum realised her daughter had packed her bags and left, she did not think that three months would pass without her coming back home. Now Nondumiso Mncwane (50) from Umlazi L section, south of Durban is worried about her daughter, Zanele (21). She left home on 29 August. Nondumiso said she hoped Zanele would come back home. “When I realised Zanele had left, I thought she had gone to a party and would come back soon. “But she has not come back.” She said in September Zanele sent her friend to give her washing powder. “The friend then gave me a number where I’d reach Zanele. When I called that number there was no answer. It just kept ringing. “After a week, another friend came to the house. She said she had been sent by Zanele to fetch her weave,” said Nondumiso. She told the friend to tell Zanele to come back home. “But that was the last time we heard anything from her. Now her friends say they do not know Zanele’s whereabouts. We have searched for her, but with no luck,” said Nondumiso. She said Zanele left her two kids behind. “They are aged four and one. They miss their mum and keep asking about her whereabouts. “I still have hope that Zanele is alive. I don’t think something bad has happened to her. I want her to come home to be with her kids.” KZN police spokeswoman, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said Zanele was last seen wearing a blue T-shirt, blue jeans and black shoes. “Anyone with information should call 031 909 9923 or 08600 10111,” said Gwala.
