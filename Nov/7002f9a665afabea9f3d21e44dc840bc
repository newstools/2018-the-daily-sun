The Economic Freedom Fighters said it will open a criminal case against Pravin Gordhan on Tuesday. EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said they will open a case at the Brooklyn Police Station at 11:00. “The criminal case is about money laundering, corruption, racketeering, fraud, contravention of Intelligence Act and, Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, and perjury,” said Ndlozi. Earlier today Gordhan went to the Brooklyn police station in Pretoria East to lay three charges against EFF leader Julius Malema. Gordhan's lawyer confirmed to News24 that he will be laying charges of criminal defamation, crimen injuria, incitement of violence against the EFF leader. Last week, Malema launched a scathing attack on Gordhan outside the venue where the minister was testifying before the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture. At the time, he called Gordhan "corrupt", "a dog of white monopoly capital" and claimed Gordhan hated black people. Malema has made claims over contracts involving Gordhan's daughter, Anisha, saying they were allegedly awarded by National Treasury and other government departments, seemingly as a result of her father's position in government. Gordhan has strongly denied that his daughter did business with the State.
