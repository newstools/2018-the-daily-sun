WHEN the residents protested, the municipality responded. Emfuleni Municipality erected speed bumps on Moshoeshoe Street in Sebokeng, the Vaal. Now motorists are complaining because the huge humps are damaging their cars. All this started two months ago when a drunk driver ran over a pedestrian. Residents took to the streets and barricaded the road with rocks, burning tyres and debris. Motorist Taahir Theletsane said the kasi needed speed humps, not barricades. Meanwhile, many took to social media to post images of cars and taxis struggling to pass the humps. Sandile Mgudlwa wrote?: “Reckless drivers kill people, but now cars and taxis are getting damaged. “Those are not normal speed humps. Can our municipality do better than this? Mohau Molahloe posted: “The municipality does not care. “These mountains are destroying our cars.” Adel Mane wrote: “There’s nothing wrong with erecting speed humps everywhere. What we ask is that they be erected in a manner that won’t damage other people’s property.” Mayoral spokeswoman Lebo Mofokeng said the speed humps were not the first of their kind on Emfuleni roads. She said: “Innocent lives were being lost. It became unbearable for the community to have one funeral after the next as a result of accidental deaths. “In all fairness, these speed humps adhere to the specifications required for such a road.”
