Joburgers are in for a treat this weekend when they will witness the biggest urban-jungle style picnic to hit the country. The Strongbow Big Picnic in partnership with MTV will transform your idea of what a picnic is by turning the Old Park Station in downtown Jozi into a stylish, green jungle accompanied by live music, good food and of course, good vibes. Taking place this Saturday, 24 November the organisers of the picnic have officially revealed the full line-up of performers. With only three days to go, the Big Picnic has revealed that South Africa’s much-loved musos Busiswa, Samthing Soweto, Trésor, Kid Fonque, DJ Kenzhero, Locnville, and Lulo Café will serenade Joburgers in attendance. Those in attendance can also look forward to seeing Sho Madjozi, Sun El Musician, Siso K, Ayanda MVP, Apple Gule and Una Rams on stage. In addition to the a-list line-up of performers, revelers will also be treated to picnic-style lounging, street food cuisine, a 360 glam cam, live broadcasts on 947, and several activations. Please note that the Big Picnic is not open to persons under the age of 18 and camp chairs and cooler boxes will not be allowed. Tickets are available for R200 per person at www.nutickets.co.za
