Limpopo Premier Chupu Mathabatha has learnt with shock of
the criminal element currently said to be operating along the N1 between
Kranskop and Mokopane. Premier spokesperson Kenny Mathivha said the Premier has
been in touch with the Provincial Commissioner, General Ledwaba, who has
already established a Special Task Team to investigate these unfortunate
incidents. In the lastest incident, about 6 people perished on
Saturday when a truck that was avoiding alleged robbers caused an unfortunate
accident which resulted in the deaths of 6 people. "As a Province, our concerns are with our people, we
can't afford to lose people in large numbers. “The Province together with National Department of
Transport will be holding a National Prayer Day near Mookgophong next Sunday,"
said Mathivha. The National Prayer Day is expected to assist in the
spiritual cleansing of the road. More than 40 people have already died in the past two
months in this ‘deadly stretch of the road’ with six more people just
yesterday. The Premier has urged drivers to be vigilant and report
any unusual activities to the police along this road.
