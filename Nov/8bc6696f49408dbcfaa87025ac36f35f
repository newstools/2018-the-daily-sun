LEGENDARY DJ and producer Oskido went all out to throw a supervise party for his long time producer and friend Bruce Sebitlo. Accompanied by Candy and Mandla Spikiri, he gathered close friends to help celebrated a Bruce’s birthday and paid a tribute to him on Instagram. Oskido remembered how 20 years ago he came to Joburg wanting to pursue music and managed to convince Bruce to join forces with him and two decades later, they are still unstoppable. He wrote:  “Over 20 years ago, I went to Mabatho to convince the dopest producer to join my music journey in Jhb. He humbly agreed and for over 20 years, together with the #kalawajazmee team we have shaped the landscape of music in South Africa.
