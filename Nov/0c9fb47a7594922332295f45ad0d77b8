THE cops are crying foul play. . . and that is because of the foul smell coming from the sewage leak running through the cop shop’s yard! The cops in Bloemspruit, Mangaung in Free State, said the rotten smell was making life difficult for them. “Clearly nobody cares about our health,” a cop told the SunTeam. One of the detectives said: “Our job is to solve serious cases such as murder, robbery and housebreaking. “We have to study the dockets, but we cannot focus in our offices. “The terrible sewage smell disturbs us.” Another cop said it was not easy for them or for the residents who came to the charge office to open cases. “Some residents have said we deliberately caused the stink so they would not come to see us. “That is ridiculous. We would never do that. I hope the matter is solved before we all get sick.” Police spokesman Brigadier Sam Makhele said the matter had been reported to the municipality, but nothing had yet been fixed. “The station commander went to the municipality to report the matter. “Unfortunately it is beyond our control to unblock the sewerage pipes,” said Makhele. Mangaung Metro municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said: “We will follow up on this matter urgently. “We cannot have a cop shop coming to a standstill because of leaking sewage.”
