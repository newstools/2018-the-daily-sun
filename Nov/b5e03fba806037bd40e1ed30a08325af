QANDU Qandu squatter camp residents are still shocked after three men were brutally shot and killed in a shack on Wednesday. Sandiso Malahle (49) heard the shots but thought it was someone building a shack in the squatter camp in Green Point, Khayelitsha, Cape Town. “I was shocked when I went outside and saw three people dead.” Malahle said two of the men were visiting their friend, who was doing his laundry. Two suspects arrived and ordered them to go into the shack, where they were shot. Zimasa Nqwili (37) was eating when she heard shots. “At first I thought someone was being robbed because shots went off. I didn’t go out at the time because I feared for my life.” When Daily Sun arrived at the scene, residents were shocked about the cruel incident in the new settlement. “People will think of this as a bad place now because of what happened,” one said. Nandipha Nakani (37) says many people in Qandu Qandu are thugs. “Many people didn’t invade the space because they needed somewhere to live but because they needed a place to do their dirty work. I feel for the families who have lost their loved ones.” Nandipha couldn’t exactly remember when Qandu Qandu was started but said the place is less than a year old. “It is the result of many land invasions around Cape Town. We’re shocked this has happened already. Imagine what will happen in a year or so,” she said. Another resident was worried the kasi would become like Marikana, where crime is rife. “The police need to stop this as it is starting, because if these criminals killing people are left to do what they want, we are going to have another Marikana here.” Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said police are investigating a triple murder case. She said police were following up on all possible leads to bring the culprits to justice.
