Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan reportedly faced
intimidation and victimisation for refusing to be a party to state capture. The judicial inquiry into state capture headed by Deputy
Chief Justice Raymond Zondo was told on Monday. The public enterprises minister told the Commission of
Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown in Joburg how Zuma fiercely pursued the
nuclear deal. “He even chaired a cabinet committee to investigate its
affordability,” said Gordhan. He said it was uncommon for the president to chair a cabinet
committee. In his juicy tell all, Gordhan said when the committee was
investigating the nuclear deal, it did not result in a cabinet reshuffle but he
believes former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene was fired for refusing to sign
off on the deal.
