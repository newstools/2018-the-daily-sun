RENI Village in Libode, near Mthatha came to a standstill on Saturday. This was not because of a protest over lack of services but to celebrate the centenary of one of the villagers. Gogo Florence Javu was the centre of attraction as scores of villagers and Nyandeni municipal members gathered to celebrate her life. Marhadebe, as she’s affectionately known in her kasi, was born on 30 October. Speaking to the SunTeam, gogo Florence said no words could explain how it felt to celebrate 100 years of life. “I shared those 100 years with Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu but they are not here. “I still feel good,” said the former high school teacher. The lively gogo founded the Mthomde Junior Secondary School, among other achievements. “I got to 100 years by being respectful to people. I am a woman of faith and God blessed me with these years,” she said. The gogo called for the youth to respect their elders to live longer. Her 79-year-old daughter, Noluxolo Gazi, said she had learnt from her mother to stand up for what she believed in. “She disciplined us well and we managed to conquer every obstacle in our lives because of the lessons she taught us,” she said. Novusile Ntoza, Nyandeni women’s caucus chairwoman, said the municipality brought gogo a recliner chair for her to sit and read her bible in comfort. “We are happy that we are celebrating her while she’s still alive,” she said.
