LESEDI Tsosane (11) cannot bear sitting at home any longer. The grade 5 pupil from Mandela Park in QwaQwa hasn’t been to school since February because she suffers from asthma and TB. Her grandfather Kolonel Tsosane said she had trouble breathing while at school. “Her condition got so bad that she couldn’t go to school anymore,” said Kolonel. He said Universitas Academic Hospital in Bloemfontein gave her a breathing machine, but sometimes the family didn’t have electricity. Kolonel said he was unemployed and Lesedi’s mum was dead. “We had to look for a room to rent in the hope that it would help us when there’s no electricity here. Lesedi said: “I want to be a doctor when I grow up so people don’t suffer like I do.” Health spokesman Mondli Mvambi said he was waiting to find out if Lesedi could be given accommodation at Universitas Academic Hospital when there’s no electricity at her home. Free State Education spokesman Howard Ndaba said Lesedi was welcome to return to school next year if she felt better.
