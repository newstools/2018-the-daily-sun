THERE is a global outcry over the kidnapping of 70 schoolchildren in Cameroon’s English speaking region. Militants advocating for the independence of the volatile north-west region of the country are accused of the mass kidnapping. Ten adults were also abducted. They were taken from a school in Nkwen, Bamenda city, which is one of the areas worst affected by violence resulting from English speakers accusing the national government dominated by French-speakers of marginalising them. “The abduction of schoolchildren and teachers can never be justified. Whoever is responsible must release and return the victims immediately,” said Samira Daoud, Amnesty International deputy regional director. Daoud said it was vital for Cameroon’s government to act swiftly and decisively to reunite abducted victims with their families. Unicef also called for the immediate and unconditional release of all the abducted children. – CAJ NEWS
