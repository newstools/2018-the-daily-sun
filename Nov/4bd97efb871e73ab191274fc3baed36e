THE aunt always asked her nephew to accompany her when she wanted to withdraw large amounts of cash from the bank. And on Wednesday Zanele Sithole (47) asked Lungelo Hadebe (41) from KwaMashu M section, north of Durban, to go with her again. But this time Lungelo never returned home. After they withdrew money at the Bridge City Shopping Centre, they were ambushed and shot. Lungelo was killed, while Zanele sustained a gunshot wound. The two were allegedly shot and robbed by three suspects in the centre’s parking lot after they withdrew R20 000 from the bank. Lungelo’s mum Thandi Ngcobo (59) said her sister Zanele used to ask her son to accompany her to the centre because they lived together at the family home. “After they had withdrawn the money and were in the car, suspects came and hit Zanele with a gun on her head and demanded her bag. Apparently she refused, and they shot her in her thigh. “Lungelo was in the passenger’s seat and they shot him as well.” She said they escaped with Zanele’s bag. “On their way out of the centre parking they came across a car and shot at it, injuring three people inside the car. “Zanele withdrew the money to buy building materials and pay builders.” Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident. “No arrests or recoveries were reported so far. Charges of attempted murder, murder and robbery were opened at KwaMashu Police Station for investigation,” Gwala said. She said while the suspects were fleeing the scene they opened fire, wounding another three people who were seated in their vehicle. Gwala said: “They sustained injuries. Three counts of attempted murder were opened at KwaMashu for investigation.” When Daily Sun called the shopping centre, portfolio manager Desmond Pretorius said Robyn Caylor should comment, but she did not respond to an email sent to her yesterday. A woman at her office said Robyn was not there but would respond once she saw the email.
