PULENG Morake lost her daughter, allegedly at the hands of the man she loves. The 28-year-old from Mangaung phase 7 said her daughter, Itumeleng (6) was poisoned by her boyfriend last week. Puleng did not even know how she was going to pay for the child’s funeral until Premier Sisi Ntombela visited her on Wednesday. The premier promised to give Itumeleng a decent funeral and to erect a tombstone for her. Itumeleng’s aunt Dieketseng Lintoe (39) said: “Last Thursday Itumeleng met her mum’s boyfriend after she returned from the shops. The boyfriend had black powder in a bottle. “He told Itumeleng to swallow it. “He then told her it was poison and she would soon die. Itumeleng ran to her gogo and started complaining of stomach pain. She foamed at the mouth. An ambulance was called, but my niece was already dead when it arrived. “I don’t know how we would have paid for the burial cost if the premier had not offered to help.” Puleng said her boyfriend was very abusive. “We met in 2015 and he used to beat me. He often accused me of being disrespectful.” The premier’s spokesman, Tiisetso Makhele, confirmed that they would help with the burial. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said: “A 28-year-old man has been arrested and charged with murder. “He will appear in court again on Monday. A black liquid has been confiscated and taken for testing.”
