BACKYARD dwellers in Durban have accused eThekwini Municipality of neglecting them. Sekusile Housing Co-operative members yesterday marched to the city hall to demand houses. Chairman Mphathiswa Mkhize said as renters, they decided to form an organisation to speak with one voice. He said they formed it in 2005 after they realised the government only built RDP houses for squatters. Mkhize said they wrote to former president Thabo Mbeki in 2005 and were referred to the KZN premier at the time, Sbu Ndebele, who told them to speak to the municipality. Mkhize said they were told to find suitable land, which they did last year, but they are still waiting. He claimed the municipality had promised to buy 32 hectares of land from a church in Amanzintoti to build them houses. “We have waited more than 10 years for houses,” he said. The protesters’ memorandum was accepted by mayor Zandile Gumede’s advisor, Mlungisi Ntombela. He said the mayor would respond within seven days. Meanwhile, gatvol residents of Mariannridge in Durban blockaded a road with burning tyres. They pulled down road signs, saying they had been neglected when it came to the allocation of houses. A resident said: “In one home, there are five generations. Fathers change in front of their children. We are sick of living like this.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the protest. He said no injuries were reported and no arrests were made.
