THE festive season is Diturupa season. And this year the people of Makapanstad in Tshwane are in for a pleasant surprise. Award-winning journalist, author and photographer Lucas Ledwaba will be hosting a photographic exhibition titled Diturupa from tomorrow to Friday at Makapanstad Primary School. The exhibition captures the tradition which dates back to the period just after World War I when African men returned home from serving as labourers in Europe. Lucas said the exhibition celebrates the spirit of community and cultural activism. “It is the first photographic exhibition to be held in the village,” he said. He said aspiring photographers and journalists will be given the opportunity to attend free workshops during the exhibition. “We can’t wait for people to come from other places and tell us their stories. “We can’t hide behind a lack of funding as an excuse for not telling our stories. “Let us take charge.” Lucas said it was important that they continue to record their history. “This exhibition is to make people appreciate the importance of preserving memories and respecting photographs and photography,” he said. “We want to get rid of the idea that photographs belong only in certain areas to be appreciated by certain sectors of society.” The exhibition is in collaboration with the Matla A Sechaba Community Trust – the organisation which organises the annual Diturupa Carnival on 26 December. Chairman of the trust Eddie Sedibe said the exhibition reinforces the culture of Diturupa and shows the way in which people celebrate their forefathers who came back from the war in 1918.
