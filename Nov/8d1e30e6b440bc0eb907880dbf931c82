THE latest figures from Statistics South Africa show 44,4 % of divorces in 2016 were couples whose marriages lasted less than 10 years. According to the statistics, the highest divorce rate was among couples who were married between five and nine years. To fight the high rate of divorce, Ziyanda Ntisa (27) formed an organisation called Iyanda Women’s Empowerment. “In marriages we face so many challenges. Statistics show there’s a high level of divorce among young women. What it means is when young women get married, there’s a high possibility they are not going to stay in the marriage. That’s why we decided we had to do something,” said Ziyanda. The group held a conference for young married woman at Masiphumelele Community Centre in Mfuleni, Cape Town, last Saturday. Nthapiseng Mazwi (28), who’s been married for eight years, said: “Marriage is a process which sometimes can be challenging. That’s why it’s important to come together and share our experiences and get advice from elders who have been on this journey longer that us. “Many of us here are younger than 35. It seems people under that age tend to get divorced so we are fighting that today.” Nthabiseng said once they’ve succeeded in keeping families together, they’ll begin to fight crime. Ziyanda said this was their first event and they planned to host more in the future. Soon they will open the organisation to young women who are preparing to get married. “It doesn’t matter where you come from, as long as you are a woman, you are welcome. “The issues we are dealing with like divorce, doesn’t only affect churchgoers but everybody,” said Ziyanda. The group looks forward to stretching throughout Mzansi.
