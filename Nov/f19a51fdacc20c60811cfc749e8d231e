THE DA hopes a court ruling will help them remove councillors who broke ranks to vote out their own mayor. The party on Tuesday launched a civil case at the Port Elizabeth High Court to try to remove three councillors who helped the ANC gain control of the metro. Mbulelo Manyathi, Trevor Louw and Neville Higgins have been giving the party a headache ever since they decided to abstain from a vote of no confidence against former mayor Athol Trollip. Manyathi was instrumental in Trollip’s ousting. Although Louw and Higgins showed up to a council meeting after Trollip was removed, the DA and its partners announced they would boycott the meeting as they regarded it as “illegitimate”. Last month a sheriff was attacked when he tried to deliver papers of dismissal to the three. The papers were torn up and the sheriff was kicked out of the city hall. Judge Elna Revelas postponed the matter to today. DA provincial leader Nqaba Bhanga said: “We cannot have councillors who represent the DA but who sit with ANC leaders at council meetings. We have now concluded internal procedures against the three councillors. “We no longer want anything to do with them, which is why we approached the court to give them their marching orders.”
