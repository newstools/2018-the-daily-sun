PATRICIA de Lille has decided to form her own party and will contest the general election. The former Cape Town mayor said she has been approached by different political parties but decided not to join them. De Lille said she has forgiven the DA for the war they declared on her. “This is the lesson that tata Madiba taught me. He came out after 27 years and he could forgive his oppressors,” she said. “I say, God forgive the fools because they don’t know what they are doing.” Addressing the media in Cape Town yesterday, De Lille said she has been approached by various political parties including the ANC and EFF but decided to form her own organisation. “I’m ready to continue to serve my country under a new political movement.” She said she did a national survey about her popularity through the Ipsos research group. She said the country is devoid of real leaders. Her aim is to involve young people with new ideas and work with experienced politicians to bring about change. “Since Tata Madiba left us, no single leader in our country has shown any real leadership and embarked on any meaningful reforms to bring about reconciliation and unity in our country,” she said. “Today is an invitation to South Africans who believe in the common good to join me.” The name of the party will be unveiled soon and the launch will take place in January. De Lille told the People’s Paper she still expected the DA to continue with the smear campaign against her. “I anticipate that my announcement today will unleash new levels of dirty tricks and fierce campaigns to discredit me and all those South Africans who will be joining me.”
