The former Parktown Boys’ High School’s assistant water polo coach has been sentenced to 23 years direct imprisonment. He was found guilty of 144 counts of sexual assault. The former teacher pleaded guilty to 144 charges after sexually assaulting 12 school boys. The boys, between the ages of 13 and 16, were assaulted between 2015 and 2016. A 17-year-old reportedly witnessed and testified about an experienced with the accused. The witness said that in 2016, he was “dry-humped” by the accused. He was also touched on his genitals and was allegedly choked by the former coach. News24 reported that Collan Rex, 22, initially faced 327 charges. However, he pleaded guilty to 144 counts of sexual assault and 12 counts of common assault. The court acquitted him of some of the charges. In handing down sentencing on Thursday, acting Judge Peet Johnson said the discretion to impose sentence was in the hands of the court and not the probation officer who compiled a report stating that Rex had difficulties growing up. “When sentencing a person court looks beyond personal circumstances,” he said. The judge said he also took into consideration the fact that there were victims who were under suicidal watch. He said Rex’s convictions were serious and were directly linked to his conduct.
