THE family of a suspect who was shot and killed at Isipingo cop shop’s holding cells is demanding full disclosure from police. His death was allegedly at the hands of another detainee during an escape attempt Mfundo Mthembu (36) from Umlazi, south of Durban, was arrested last Saturday by Isipingo cops. Police said Mfundo was killed by another prisoner during an escape while being kept in police cells, but his mother Ethel Mthembu doesn’t believe the cops’ story. Ethel (63) told Daily Sun on Friday that her son’s death was still a mystery. She said when the family went to identify the body at the mortuary, they were told no bullet was found in his body and there was no exit wound either. She said the family suspected Mfundo was killed by a bullet from a cop gun and that he wasn’t shot by the prisoner, as police claim. She said post mortem results revealed that he died of a gunshot wound to the chest. “We believe the bullet was removed to destroy evidence. Where is the bullet that killed him?” Mfundo was buried on Saturday at his home in Umlazi. Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokesman Moses Dlamini said they were investigating the circumstances leading to Mfundo’s death. This would include determining how the suspect entered the police cells with a firearm. Four other suspects were wounded during the incident. He said the suspect who allegedly shot Mfundo was charged with murder, attempted murder and attempting to escape from lawful custody. He is expected to appear in the Umlazi Magistrates Court today.
