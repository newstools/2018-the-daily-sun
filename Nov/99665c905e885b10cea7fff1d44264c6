MUNICIPAL workers who came to fix a pipe a month ago dug a big trench and left it open. Now residents of Hostel One in Mangaung fear kids who play near the dangerous hole may fall in and die. “When the pipe burst, we called the municipality and municipal workers came to fix it. They dug a big trench to fix the pipe, but left it open and promised to come back the following day as it was dark. “But they never showed up. “It’s been a month now. We have to lock our kids in the house because they could drown,” said a resident. The situation is also inconveniencing residents as their taps are still dry. They claim they are forced to ask for water elsewhere. Samuel Thoba (28) said his house was being flooded. “Every day I try to scoop the water out of my house, but it just keeps coming back. Now my furniture is damaged,” said Samuel. He woke up one morning to find water on his floor. “I was very confused as it wasn’t even raining. I called the municipality and officials came to check. “They promised to come back the next day to fix it, but I never saw them again.” Mangaung municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said the matter will be solved soon. “I will send my team to attend to it,” he said.
