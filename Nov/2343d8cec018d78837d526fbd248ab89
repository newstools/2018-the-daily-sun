CHIPPA United coach Eric Tinkler hopes his charges will raise the bar tonight (7.30pm) to show how badly they want to move away from the bottom half of the Absa Premiership table. The Chilli Boys face fellow strugglers Maritzburg United in a league clash at Harry Gwala Stadium. This will be an interesting clash considering that a single point currently separates the clubs. Chippa are tied with Black Leopards in 13th spot with nine points from 10 matches, while Maritzburg are second bottom with nine points and a game in hand. Fadlu Davids’ side is four points ahead of basement club AmaZulu, who tackle Highlands Park in another league match in Makhulong, Tembisa, at the same time. Chippa have won two games, drawn three and lost five, while Maritzburg have won only one game so far, drawn five and lost three. Said Tinkler: “This is a big game, it’s a six-pointer. It won’t be easy because Maritzburg are a difficult side to beat at home. They are a hard working team, aggressive and good on transition. We have to match them in all departments and the team that wants it most, will win the match.” The former Orlando Pirates mentor says the break due to Fifa international calendar and Telkom Knockout gave him enough time to fine-tune his side. “The break gave me time to prepare and work on improving certain aspects of our game. If we work hard collectively I am certain we will get positive results.” The Port Elizabeth side will be without Andile Mbenyane who is out injured, while veteran defender Thabo Nthethe was not included in the travelling squad either, having only recently recovered from injury.
