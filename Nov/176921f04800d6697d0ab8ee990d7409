FORMER president Jacob Zuma stopped the appointment of a Transnet CEO and insisted his preferred candidate take the position. Former public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan yesterday told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Joburg that Zuma insisted the job be given to Siyabonga Gama, although the board had approved Sipho Maseko. “He didn’t want to listen to the recommendations for Maseko. My understanding was that he wanted Gama and no one else. Gama was facing misconduct charges at the time and Zuma said no one should be appointed until the disciplinary process against Gama was completed,” she said. At the time, Gama was head of the freight division at Transnet and had been suspended. Hogan said Zuma’s supporters in the ANC made up stories that Gama had been sidelined during the recruitment process because he was black. She said they claimed acting CEO Chris Wells sidelined Gama so he could have the job. She said this was untrue as Wells was not interested in the position. Hogan said then deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe and her deputy, Enoch Godongwana, agreed that Maseko was right for the job. “I had to attend NEC meetings and meetings of the tripartite alliance and some people were very nasty to me,” she said. “What really offended is that I was cast as an anti-transformation racist who did not appreciate the necessity for transformation in this country. That really offended me. I expected better from my colleagues who knew my history. I expected the president to defend me but he hung me out to dry.” Hogan said after the ANC Polokwane conference, a group in the ANC came to believe it was so powerful it could appoint board members and CEOs of state-owned companies. She said this faction pressured her to appoint Gama, who was not found guilty of fraud but fired in 2010 as recommended by an independent inquiry. Hogan said he was rehired the following year after she was fired as public enterprises minister and replaced by Malusi Gigaba.
