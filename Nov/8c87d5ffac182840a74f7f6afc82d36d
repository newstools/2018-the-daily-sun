Bafana Bafana and former Mamelodi Sundowns player Bongani Zungu and his long time girlfriend Khanyi Cele are engaged. The 26-year-old Portugal based soccer star has finally proposed to his lover in Paris, next to the Eiffel Tower and she said yes! He took to his Instagram account and posted snaps of pictures of himself popping the question to his lady.Bongani has previously been accused of cheating but it seems like love conquers everything. Even though the couple has been through ups and downs, they’ve always found a way to be in each other’s arms. And now, they’ve made it official. They look so deeply in love more than they were before. Bongani and his fiancé have since received tons of congratulatory messages on social media. The Amiens midfielder is considered one of the best players who’s representing the country abroad.He recently suffered a horrible injury while playing in September and has been off the field, recovering from his knee surgery. He currently posted videos of himself, back in the gym. Since there’s progress, he could well get back in time for Bafana Bafana’s crucial African Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya in March.  20.11.2018 ????
