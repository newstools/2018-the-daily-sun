WHEN a rowdy relative came home drunk, Ncamisile Khumalo knew there would be chaos. But the 28-year-old from KwaMancinza, north of Durban, had no idea death would strike. Her 24-year-old relative allegedly killed her dad Amos Nala (68) on Sunday after demanding food. Ncamisile said she, her dad and two kids were sleeping when the relative barged in early in the morning, shouting that they must open for him. “He kicked the door in, stormed in and shouted that he was hungry,” she said. Ncamisile’s dad, who was sleeping alone, asked the relative to stop making a noise. “He went to my father’s room and I think he beat him with his fists before pulling up his bed. My father fell on the floor.” Ncamisile said the relative ran out of the shack and she ran to her father’s room. “I couldn’t get in because the bed was upside down,” she said. “My father was lying on the other side. I asked neighbours to help me pull him out. “We called an ambulance, but paramedics declared him dead.” Residents caught her relative and he was arrested. Captain Nqobile Gwala told the People’s Paper: “The suspect was arrested on the same day by Ntuzuma police for murder. He was due to appear in court.
