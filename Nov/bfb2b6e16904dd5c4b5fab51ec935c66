THE festive season has not yet started but people are already dying on the highways. There were over 1 800 deaths on Mzansi’s roads between July and September – and the worst is yet to come. On Monday, six people died after a taxi allegedly travelling at high speed crashed into a stationary truck on the N3 South near Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. Ekurhuleni Disaster Management and Emergency Services spokesman William Ntladi said 10 people were taken to various hospitals around Ekurhuleni. He said the taxi had apparently been blown by the wind into the truck, which had broken down in the emergency lane. The taxi went under the trailer of the truck during the crash. With summer coming the roads will be wet and slippery. Road Traffic Management Corporation spokesman Simon Zwane said motorists should drive slowly and make sure their wipers and tyres are in a good condition. Zwane said it’s important that vehicles are roadworthy as vehicles can be taken off the road if they are not.
