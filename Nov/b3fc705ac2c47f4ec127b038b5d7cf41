OBED Mbatha said young people should be taught about their past. The 77-year-old from KwaMashu, south of Durban was speaking at the kasi’s 60th birthday celebration at the local sports centre yesterday. “The first residents were forcibly removed from Umkhumbane, Durban in 1958. They wanted us far from the CBD.” He said they had to adjust to living 25km from the city centre among huge sugar-cane fields, when previously they had been only 7km away. Edmund Mhlongo, the founder of the Ekhaya Arts Centre in the kasi, said: “KwaMashu produced actor and director Simon “Mabhunu” Sabela, Shaka Zulu actor Henry Cele, former chief justice Pius Langa, Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, soccer player Siyabonga Nomvethe, musician Zakwe and top radio producer Jacinta Ngobese. “Youth can learn from them.” Ngobese said youngsters needed to think about securing a bright future. “Let us encourage kids to love education and know that it is a good thing that can help open doors.”
