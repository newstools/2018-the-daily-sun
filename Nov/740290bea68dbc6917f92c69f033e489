hearts of South Africans when he starred on SABC1’s Skeem Saam as Sakhile and
now he can be seen on SABC2’s flagship soapie 7de Laan where he plays a doctor. Now the Nelspruit-born star says he wants make his mark on the international
stages with his music. Speaking to
Sun Buzz, the star he wants to break the mould and make it as a musician in
America.  “I want to make it abroad,
especially in America, but also I don’t want to leave my African roots. It’s
easy for them to make it here, so I also want to show that as African artists
we can also compete globally,” he said. He said his chosen preferred genre of
music is afro pop, because it has a broader appeal.  Said Nicholas: “I want to appeal to young
people by singing music that resonates with them, because that is a niche
market that will listen and understand my music”. He said he
is gearing himself to release a debut album next year.
