BANYANA Banyana are determined to keep the promise they made to South Africans and qualify for their first ever Fifa Women’s World Cup. And the chances are 70% in their favour that they will win their group at the African Women’s Cup of Nations (Women’s Afcon) currently underway in Ghana, which serves as World Cup qualifiers. They have collected six points in two matches, leaving them top of Group B, shocking reigning champions and record holders Nigeria, and 2008 and 2010 queens Equatorial Guinea. In their last group game against Zambia, scheduled for Accra Stadium tomorrow (6pm SA time), Banyana only need a point to secure their place in the semifinals. Reaching the semis will mean they are edging closer to their dream – qualifying for their first ever Women’s World Cup and making history in the process. Midfield maestro Linda Motlhalo says they cannot pop the champagne just yet, as they have to keep their eye on the prize, making the final next Saturday (1 December). “We came to the Women’s Afcon prepared because we knew it would not be easy. We know what is at stake. We need each other to win this one and the World Cup remains the main goal. We have to live up to our promise,” said Motlhalo, who was on the scoresheet when Banyana demolished the Equatorial Guineans 7-1 on Wednesday. The 20-year-old dribbling wizard also gave credit to her teammates for the effort they have put in so far at this tournament.
