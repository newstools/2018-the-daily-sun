WORKING women have a lot to deal with: They have to keep up with men while doing everything that other women expect them to do. Being caught like that between two worlds is stressful and it will eventually harm a woman’s well-being. According to Sibonile Dube, head of communications and public affairs at Novartis South Africa, a women’s well-being is critical to her success. Dube quoted research by Bain & Company’s into how and why the career paths of Mzansi’s men and women differ. They found that in 2017, 31% of South African companies had no women in a senior leadership role. A census on women in leadership, organised by the Businesswomen’s Association of South Africa, found that only 10% of South African CEOs and 2,2% of JSE-listed company CEOs were women. Why are women so busy in South African businesses yet so under-represented in senior management? Lack of confidence Dube said: “As women, we often undersell ourselves. We underestimate our potential, our power and the amount of influence that we have. “In contrast, men are typically quite confident about themselves and their capabilities.” Lack of support Men generally back one another, be it in corporate or business deals, and this support leads to career success. “Having a network of supporters is important. It is through these networks that opportunities are shared and mentorships formed. Having a strong network of people who protect your reputation and career is critical in times of challenges.” Impossible demands To be competitive at work, women need to make sure they take care of their health. Women need to know when stress threatens their mental well-being. “Women are pressed to perform with men but are forced to apply the same time and energy to motherhood and relationships. When they break from these impossible demands, they are blamed for their inability to multi-task. These are the demands placed on women,” said Dube.
