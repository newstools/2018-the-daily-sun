BUOYANT Desiree Ellis says pressure is the name of the game but she remains positive as Banyana Banyana kick off their 2018 Women's Africa Cup of Nations (Awcon) in Ghana. South Africa start the tournament with a crunch encounter against the defending champions Nigeria at the Cape Coast Stadium on Sunday (5.30pm, SA time.) Ellis' charges went to the tournament in Ghana with one objective - to qualify for next year's Fifa World Cup to be hosted in France. Coach, as Ellis is known, admitted that there’s immense pressure on the Mzansi lasses. “We just have to be positive because the pressure will rub off on the players,” said Ellis. “If there are any nerves or negativity, it will  rub off on the players. "You know we had a good preparation this year, but that doesn’t guarantee you success. But it prepares you. Results will come if the players execute the plan on the field.” “We are not sounding arrogant in any way, but the time is now. Now it’s a matter of gratitude to say 'thank you' to everyone. And that should be a positive result on Sunday. "We have to start well, we cannot start the match the way we did against Ghana in a friendly match last Sunday. Nigeria are a top team. We have to go one step better, we cannot keep on saying we are close over and again.” Banyana arrived in Ghana a week ago and have played a friendly against the Black Queens, the hosts, losing 1-0. She concluded: “The experience is enough and it will rub to the other players who have few caps in the competition. Pressure will always be there it’s just how you handle and take it off from the players. “I believe the players are dedicated and committed. We cannot keep talking about the potential we have to do the job now.”
