UNIONS, ordinary workers and the unemployed all called for the City of Joburg to insource its security detail. The city accepted the calls and the many security guards working for private security contractors rejoiced. But it appears their joy did not last long. The city received a wave of 35 000 applications for the 4 000 positions, and many of those who had a job with private companies now face having no job at all. Joburg Metro police spokesman Wayne Minnaar said the city could not re-employ all those who were originally employed as security guards at facilities. Pule Maseko (40) was one of many working for a private security company, stationed at the Eldorado Park Swimming Pool, and he was initially very excited. “We wanted to get out of the clutches of private security companies. They had irregular working hours and their pay did not reflect that,” he said. Now many like Pule are caught up in uncertainty. “I started working at the pool in April 2017. They started the process of insourcing in May 2017. We continued working, but have not been paid since July.” Pule said if they had known this was going to happen they would have continued working for the private companies: “Poor pay is better than no pay.”
