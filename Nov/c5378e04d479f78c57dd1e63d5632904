BANYANA Banyana will depart for Ghana next Friday (9 November) where they will have the first taste of conditions in Ghana when they take on the hosts in an international friendly at the Accra Sports Stadium on Sunday, 11 November at 6pm (SA Time).The clash is part of preparations for the two nations who have been drawn in apart in the upcoming 2018 Africa Women Cup of Nations, to be hosted by Ghana from 17 November to 1 December.Banyana head coach Desiree Ellis said playing hosts of a tournament, Ghana in this case, is another step in the right direction to check on their readiness for the tournament.She said: “Getting used to the conditions as well as playing a top team like them will give us another different challenge and prepare us for the competition. We will get to experience it firsthand the atmosphere, which will almost be like what we will go through when the tournament starts.”South Africa has been drawn in Group B alongside Nigeria, Kenya and Zambia, while Ghana will take on Cameroon, Mali and Algeria in Group A.  Banyana and the Black Stars last met in the 2016 AFCON in Cameroon, with Ghana emerging victorious 1-0 in the third/fourth place place off.Ellis added: “They are a tough nation to play against, more so because they have been in camp for quite a while now. They have lined up another friendly against Zambia before they play us, which will give them some momentum, and they will really challenge us- which is what we need.“I have always said before that nothing beats playing matches to prepare for a tournament because in that way you are able to pinpoint areas where you need to rectify, so I can only convey my greatest gratitude to both Safa and the Ghana FA for agreeing to this fixture. I believe it will go a long way in helping both nations prepare thoroughly. After playing the Cosafa Cup we now need to take it a notch higher to get to where we want to be at the end of the AFCON.”In the tournament itself, Banyana Banyana will open their account with a clash against Nigeria, who are the defending champions. Next up will be Kenya before rounding off the group stages when they take on Zambia.The first two fixtures will be played at the Cape Coast Stadium.The top two sides in the groups will progress to the semi-finals – and the top three nations will qualify for the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup in France in June.Ellis is expected to name her final squad of 21 players on Wednesday.
