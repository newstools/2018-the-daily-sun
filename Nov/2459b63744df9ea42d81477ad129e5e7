HOLIDAYS are the stuff of nightmares – that is when drunk drivers wreak the most havoc. Yesterday, traffic cops and police officers turned to prayer and rituals to stop the carnage on our roads. Cops and different faith-based organisations prayed and cleansed the N14 and R24 regional road. Police spokesman Constable Lucky Matome said the cleansing ceremony was part of a national and provincial programme. “We join different faith-based organisations for weekly sessions,” he said. “We also open our doors to different churches that want to pray at cop shops.” Station commander Lieutenant-Colonel Christina Tshoaedi said: “Although faith organisations have partnered to fight crime, we urge all residents to join the war so our kasis can become good places to live in.” Matome urged residents to be vigilant during the festive season and refrain from drinking and driving.
