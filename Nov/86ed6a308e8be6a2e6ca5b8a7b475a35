ROYAL Eagles seem to be one of the most inconsistent local clubs when it comes to keeping coaches. Just nine games into the 2018-19 season, the KwaZulu-Natal outfit has apparently again parted ways with Roger Sikhakhane. SunSport has reliably learnt that experienced former Zesco United coach Zlatko Krmpotic will take over. Krmpotic, who hails from Serbia, will be the fourth mentor to take charge of the club since January. In addition to Sikhakhane, who is currently on sick leave according to the club, former Orlando Pirates coach Kosta Papic and Vladislav Heric, now the coach of Ubuntu Cape Town, have tried to fly with Eagles. When contacted by SunSport, Eagles manager James Dlamini would not confirm the appointment of the new coach. He did reveal, however, that the club is currently in negotiations with a coach to stand in for Sikhakhane and an announcement could be made today. He said: “Roger is still our coach. But we are negotiating with another coach since he’s gone on sick leave and his assistant, Kagiso Dikgacoi, is still suspended.” Asked what would happen to the coach they are interviewing if he’s successful and Sikhakhane gets fit for work again, Dlamini responded somewhat irately: “We have not hired a coach, Roger is still the coach. So I cannot say anything on that.” Sikhakhane, who has been fired more times than any other coach in the Premier Soccer League, was not available for comment. His phone rang unanswered. Eagles are ninth in the National First Division standings with 12 points after nine games, registering three victories, three draws and three defeats. The club added a new player recently when they registered the club boss’ son, Andile Mpisane, with the team. Eagles host Maccabi FC next at Chatsworth Stadium on Saturday (3pm).
