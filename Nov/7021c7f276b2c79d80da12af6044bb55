The results are in, the trophies have been handed out, the stars have graced the carpet and everyone has gone home. All that is left to do now is to reflect on the 5th annual All Africa Music Awards (AFRIMA); to reflect on who won versus who should’ve won, to reflect on the production of the ceremony, and of course, to reflect on the fashion. For purposes of this here article, we shall focus on the red-carpet fashion that graced the AFRIMAs. For the most part, the fashion was what we all would’ve expected, a celebration of Africa’s rich culture through fabric, texture, colour and the extravagance that only Africa could produce. It was a night of ball gowns matched with elaborate head wraps, beads, bold prints and colours with some unexpected twists. Here are AFRIMA 2018’s stand-out looks from this past weekend’s ceremony: Red Carpet #5thAFRIMA A post shared by  #5thAFRIMA-Ghana 2018 (@afrimawards) on Nov 24, 2018 at 1:34pm PST   Faces at 5th AFRIMA Red Carpet #AFRIMA2018 A post shared by  #5thAFRIMA-Ghana 2018 (@afrimawards) on Nov 24, 2018 at 1:28pm PST  Pictures from Red-carpet #afrima2018 A post shared by  #5thAFRIMA-Ghana 2018 (@afrimawards) on Nov 24, 2018 at 1:10pm PST  ?Beautiful Faces Gracing The Red Carpets Of #AFRIMA2018.?
