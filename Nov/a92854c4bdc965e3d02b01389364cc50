NOMSA Matlala is struggling to find closure after her sister was killed, allegedly by cops. Constance Mabula was gunned down in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, three years ago. Cops were apparently pursuing hijackers. The 36-year-old from Alexandra, north of Joburg, said: “My brother said the shooting was like a hailstorm. “I want them to have their day in court. I lost a sister and her kids lost their mum.” She said the implicated cops should be charged with murder. A case was opened with Ipid. “We weren’t given reports on the case and have been going back and forth.” She said those involved were disciplined and dismissed, which she felt was just a slap on the wrist. Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said: “The director of public prosecutions held an inquest, and the docket was forwarded to the Tembisa court. “Investigators told the woman’s husband of the decision.” He said the cops were waiting for an inquest date.
