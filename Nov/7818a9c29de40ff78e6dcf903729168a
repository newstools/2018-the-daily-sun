Shoprite Checkers has been ordered to remove the word "margarine" when advertising Rama “Original” product. This is after Dave Bennett complained to the Advertising Regulatory Board (ARB) that Shoprite Checkers has advertised Rama original spread as margarine in one of its catalogues. Bennett argued that he product is not “margarine” as legally defined. “You can only call yellow “margarine” product “margarine” if it contains a maximum of 16% water, and the Rama product contains more water than that,” argued Bennett. Shoprite Checkers submitted that it investigated the complaint and found the mistake to have occurred in only one of its divisions, in KwaZulu-Natal, with all the other divisions labelling the product correctly in all advertising material. The KwaZulu-Natal advertising team has been informed accordingly, and it will ensure that going forward, the word "margarine" will not be used when advertising Rama. Having considered all the material before it, the Directorate of the ARB said the main objective of the Advertising Regulatory Board is to protect consumers from advertising that contravenes the Code of Advertising Practice. “In the vast majority of instances where advertising is found to contravene the Code, the ARB will require the advertising to be withdrawn or amended. “In this matter, the advertiser has undertaken not to use the term “margarine” in its advertising in relation to the Rama “Original” product going forward. This undertaking is not only unequivocal, but clearly addresses the concerns raised by Mr Bennett. There is therefore no need to consider or investigate the matter any further.”
