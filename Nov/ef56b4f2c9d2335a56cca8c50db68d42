PROMINENT Mzansi road running queen Glenrose Xaba battled to hold back tears as she was finally awarded her Spar Grand Prix Women’s 10km Challenge title in Joburg on Thursday. She could not make it to the awards ceremony, however, due the Electrical Engineering final exam she had to take at the Tshwane University of Technology. Xaba, who is coached by Michael “Sponge” Seme and trains with Caster Semenya’s wife, Violet, received R185 000 and a trophy. She is also SA marathon champion Stephen Mokoka’s training partner at the High Performance Centre at the University of Pretoria. Xaba finished in the top three overall last year but this year managed to beat household names such as last year’s winner Kesa Molotsane, back-to-back Soweto Marathon winner Irvette Van Zyl, former winner Mapaseka Makhanya and the Phalula twins, Lebo and Lebogang. The Grand Prix consists of races in Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Pietermaritzburg, Pretoria and Joburg. In a recorded message, the tearful Xaba said after trying for five years, her biggest dream had come true: “I am honoured to have won the Grand Prix and to have my name on this amazing trophy alongside so many great athletes. This year was very tough, I thank God I had a good position in each race and for my Pretoria win, which helped me win the title.”
