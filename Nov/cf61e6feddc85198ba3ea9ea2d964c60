THERE are 18 stores at Big Box Park in KwaMashu, north of Durban. Although the shopping centre is a hive of activity, customers and shop owners share one toilet. The centre has two toilets, but the other one has been locked since it became blocked four months ago. A shopper said she had gone for breakfast at one of the restaurants when she realised there was only one toilet for men and women. “I went to the toilet and found men and women in a queue,” said the shopper. “I think this is unsafe and it shouldn’t be happening.” Shop owners told Daily Sun they were badly affected by the toilet situation because they spent most of their time at the centre. A shop owner said the toilet wasn’t cleaned properly as the cleaner only came once a week.  Another said she didn’t answer nature’s call because she couldn’t share a toilet with men. “The blocked toilet should’ve been fixed ages ago. This is unfair. “We pay rent, but management fails to keep the centre in a good condition. “There are other problems such as security, which we’ve complained about.  But management just ignores us,” she said. Manager Sineziswe Khumalo said a supervisor was instructed to deal with the matter.
