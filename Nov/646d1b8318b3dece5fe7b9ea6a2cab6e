When an elderly couple’s shack burned to ashes three months ago, they were devastated. They didn’t know how they would begin to pick up the pieces as they were only left with the clothes on their backs. Daily Sun published their story “Tenant saved old couple” on 23 August. But on Saturday, madala Samson Nkosi (70) and his wife gogo Sarah Manganyi (77) from Kwamhlanga were happy when they received a brand new house. It was handed over by NEC member Pemmy Majodina and Mpumalanga co-operative governance MEC Speedy Mashilo. Majodina said they believed in servicing communities at all times. “The government’s committed to changing lives of the people of Mzansi. “The couple will now live happily ever after. “Their tears have been wiped away and their hearts are filled with joy,” she said. Mashilo said he knew residents of Moloto Village struggled with water. He assured them it would soon be a thing of the past as a permanent solution was under way. “A big dam is being built. “It will get water from the Loskop dam. “Once the dam is complete, the water problem will be a thing of the past in the Thembisile Hani Municipality,” said Mashilo. He said Rand Water had promised to increase the water supply from 32 megalitres to 52 megalitres. Madala and his wife said when they lost everything they felt like the world was weighing heavily on them. They told Daily Sun they were now very happy. “We did not know that losing everything was just a blessing in disguise,” said the madala. “Today, we are very happy we have received a house. “We’re going to enjoy our Christmas in a proper house for the very first time in our lives,” he said.
