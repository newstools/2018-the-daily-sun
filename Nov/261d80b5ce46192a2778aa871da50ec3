A FINANCE intern at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in Umlazi, south of Durban, has been suspended. The intern apparently posted on Facebook that he felt like raping his 10-year-old neighbour! In a series of posts under #Silungisa_Icountry, which means “We’re fixing the country”, the intern wrote: “Ingane yakamakhelwane ina 10yrs. “Kuthi angiyidlwengule Nyi! Nyi! Kuphele ukuphapha.” Translated, this means: “My neighbour’s child is 10 and I feel like raping her because she’s too forward.” In a second post he wrote that he wished to do the same to a seven-year-old girl. Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo told Daily Sun: “We’ve since instructed management of Prince Mshiyeni to remove this person, pending the outcome of an investigation.” Dhlomo said the posts had sparked a huge public outcry and complaints. He urged health department staff to conduct themselves with dignity on social media. The MEC warned them against conduct that may bring their employer, the department, into disrepute.
