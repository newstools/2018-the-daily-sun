A FIRE has gutted Jumpers yet again! About 100 shacks in the kasi in Cleveland, Joburg, caught fire in the early hours of yesterday, leaving 75 people homeless. Emergency staff arranged temporary shelter at a community centre. Joburg Emergency Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said victims would be provided with food parcels and blankets. “Other government and private organisations will donate stuff to the 75 people.” Mulaudzi urged people to handle paraffin stoves, candles and other sources of open flames with care. “We urge residents, especially in squatter camps, not to leave heating devices unattended.” He said the fire broke out shortly before midday.  The cause was unknown and investigations were continuing. There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries.  Two people were treated for smoke inhalation.
