ONCE again, desperate jobseekers have become victims of a job scam. People have flocked to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto after seeing job ads on social media. Zenzo Ndabula, the hospital’s acting spokesman, told Daily Sun: “Somebody is posing as Maxwell Maremini, claiming to be our staff member.” Maxwell allegedly sells jobs at the hospital through fake ads. Ndabula said every position at the hospital is advertised on the Gauteng government website and the public services and administration department. “We place adverts in the newspapers.” Yesterday, many victims were seen at the hospital enquiring about jobs. Nolundi Yakobe (36) said: “I was about to pay R3000, but I wanted to meet that person at the hospital.” Jane Chiloane has been unemployed since 2013. She said she borrowed money for the taxi, hoping to get a job. Ndabula said: “We’re specific on the position and on the requirements for the job.” He said victims of the scams have been coming to the hospital. “They complain that Maxwell has taken their money,” he said. The real Maxwell, who works in the human resource department at the hospital, said people were always calling him. “Some even went to his house and he feared they might hurt him. According to Ndabula, one person paid about R6 000 and another R3 000. Police spokeswoman Captain Phephi Matlou-Mthetho said a fraud case has been opened at Diepkloof cop shop. “Police are investigating but no one has been arrested.”
