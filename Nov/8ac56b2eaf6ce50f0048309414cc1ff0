TO MANAGE financial management challenges in struggling municipalities, the Mpumalanga government is using discretionary intervention, according to the Municipal Finance Management Act. This will take place at four municipalities. Speaking at the lekgotla held in Skukuza on Tuesday, Premier Refilwe Mtshweni said the financial management of Govan Mbeki, Thaba Chweu, Lekwa and Msukaligwa municipalities will be dealt with before the situation gets out of hand and affects service delivery. “We are aware of the challenges at some municipalities and recently had to intervene at Emalahleni. “A task team led by provincial treasury, including specialists in every aspect of financial management, has been sent to the municipality and is working to develop and put in place a financial recovery plan,” she said. Mtshweni said lekgotlas are held to co-ordinate government programmes. This is to ensure the programmes are linked to the most important areas that aim to tackle poverty, unemployment and inequality, while ensuring people have access to basic services. “The government needs to use these platforms to discuss challenges and helpful actions and ensure they continue efforts to centrally co-ordinate the supply of basic services,” the premier said.
