ONE of the most loved shows on Mzanzi Magic, Date My
Family, is back. But Tweeps felt that the first episode was “boring”. Date My Family helps singletons find love by sending them
on dates with their potential partner's family. This week a bachelor, named Francois, visited three
families searching for a potential date. At the end he chose his date, but he ended up being friend
zoned. The lady told him she will only go on a second date “as a
friend”. Twitter felt that this week's episode has been a disappointment. It seems the only "funny" part was when Francois was friend zoned "live on national TV".
