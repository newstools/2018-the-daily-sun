ONE of the most loved shows on Mzanzi Magic, Date My
Family, is back. But Tweeps felt that the first episode was “boring”. Date My Family helps singletons find love by sending them
on dates with their potential partner's family. This week a bachelor, named Francois, visited three
families searching for a potential date. At the end he chose his date, but he ended up being friend
zoned. The lady told him she will only go on a second date “as a
friend”. Twitter felt that this week's episode has been a disappointment. It seems the only "funny" part was when Francois was friend zoned "live on national TV".  The long anticipated episode just sent me back to my sleep #DateMyFamily  #DateMyFamily Me trying to figure out, this Francois episode? pic.twitter.com/DmmRVYdr01  #DateMyFamily friend zone pic.twitter.com/mFO44tKfvp  #DateMyFamily “wanna parrttii” ended me ???????????? pic.twitter.com/iz3ZVQZHtW Marcelos reaction after being put in the friend zone #DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/GViP9j9VyT  #DateMyFamily we are saddened by this episode..
