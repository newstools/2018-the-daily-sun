RESIDENTS at Mpandoni Tshaulu Village outside Thohoyandou are still overwhelmed with grief and shock. This follows the killing of a woman in the area, allegedly by her boyfriend. Mberegeni Mukhuba (35) apparently committed suicide after the killing. The woman, Tondani Netshifhefhe (31), travelled all the way from Polokwane, Limpopo where she worked, to be with her boyfriend for the weekend. Sources said she looked happy and even attended a party in the village. What led to the tragedy is still a mystery but domestic violence is suspected. The incident happened last Sunday afternoon at her boyfriend’s house. A sharp object is believed to have been used to kill her. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said police were immediately notified and responded immediately. “Preliminary investigations pointed to the possibility of her partner’s involvement in the murder,” said Mojapelo. Since this brutal incident, the police had been on the hunt for the suspect until his body was found hanging from a tree in the bush near Mpandoni Village on Wednesday morning. Police investigations are continuing. Mberegeni was buried on Friday and only close family members attended his funeral. Tondani hasn’t been buried yet.
