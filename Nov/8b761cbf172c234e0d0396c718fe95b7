BAFANA Bafana coach Stuart Baxter insists that the unavailability of Nigeria’s top goal-scorer  Odion Ighalo doesn’t guarantee his side victory. Ighalo, who plies his trade for Chinese club Changchun Yatai, will miss the crucial Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between the two countries at FNB Stadium tomorrow (3pm) due to injury. The 29-year-old is the Super Eagles’ top scorer in Afcon’s Group E with six goals. A win for either side will guarantee them a place in the Afcon tournament in Cameroon next year. Bafana are a point behind leaders Nigeria, who have eight points from four matches. Said Baxter: “They took out Ighalo and put in (Kelechi) Iheanacho. Ighalo is the top scorer, so obviously they will feel that’s a bit of a blow. But in terms of reality I am sure Iheanacho wants to impress. Like I said before, we need to concentrate on what we do. What they do will depend on how badly we play.” Baxter revealed he already has an idea what his starting lineup will look like. “I have an idea, maybe there are two players I am not 100% sure of at the moment. It’s the first time some of them have played together. We have done the tactical stuff and some of them are still trying to find each other.” The Scottish mentor stressed that it’s crucial to qualify now rather than leaving it too late. Bafana will wrap up their group fixtures with a date with Libya away in March next year. Said Baxter: “Of course we don’t (want to leave it late). But if it has to go that way then it will go that route.CONTINUED ON PAGE 39
