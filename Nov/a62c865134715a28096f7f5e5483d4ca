Actress, producer and businesswoman, Nolo Phiri is returning to the role that made her a household name. Nolo, who played Niki on the popular e.tv soapie, Rhythm City for six years before leaving the show almost two years ago, is making a big return. In 2017 Nolo told fans on her social media that leaving the show was a tough decision for her. “Words cannot begin to describe the fond memories and such special relationships I've been blessed with. Being Niki was just the cherry on top. I wish the show bigger and better things as I do for myself as I take a chance on me. I've found that growing up means being honest about what I want, what I need, and what I feel I am. So I'm jumping before I get pushed," she said. But, she has now changed her tune and returned to the much-loved show. Nolo will resume playing the feisty Niki this month and the character is said to be back with a whole lot of drama. According to e.tv, Niki is going to “stir the pot between Suffocate and Puleng who have thus far mended their relationship and living a blissful life but all that bliss will fade slowly when a tragedy befalls the Ndlovu clan”. ICYMI: NOLO PHIRI SAYS BYE-BYE TO RHYTHM CITY! Niki’s exit from the show two years ago was a dramatic one, having skipped town after killing Themba, Suffocate’s younger brother and leaving her daughter Busi to be raised by Puleng. “She has since been on the run for murder and is named as the number one fugitive to look out for. She had confessed the murder to Puleng on a note detailing how and why she killed Themba,” the channel says. Niki now returns after hearing that Busi is missing. Catch Nolo Phiri on Rhythm City from Monday, 19th November at 7PM on e.tv.
