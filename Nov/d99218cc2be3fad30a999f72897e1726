FOLLOWING a court judgment, the board of Alex FM elected in May 2015 has been restored and an annual general meeting will probably be held on 24 November. Pamela Mallela, chairwoman of the radio station, said after the judgement on 18 October this year, they can set the record straight. Battles between the staff and the board led the community to believe that the board was unfit to hold office. “We have been painted in a very bad light by the community and we were not given a chance to explain ourselves,” she said. “The community is still in the dark and doesn’t know the real facts. The staff used their broadcasting power to tarnish our names.” Mallela said they didn’t refuse to step down but could not resign because it would mean they were running away. “Every time we tried to have an AGM to elect a new board, the staff would disrupt the process. The board is not elected by the staff but the community, and this will be done in the next two weeks. Icasa will be part of the process.”
