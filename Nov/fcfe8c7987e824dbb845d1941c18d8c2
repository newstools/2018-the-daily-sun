ABONGILE Nqubula, who is better known as Chunky Jama, has finally released his debut album, Impumelelo. The 24-year-old Afro-pop singer from Lusikisiki in Eastern Cape said the album talks about his success in the music industry. “The album is in Xhosa. “I named it Impumelelo because I believe its completion is a success to me. “I have worked with artists such as Mooze T, Qhawekazi, Madboi, Sweet Melodies, Saida Da Prince and Khayi on the album,” said Chunky. He told Daily Sun his love of music started at the age of 15. He was still at school. “I started my music career with a hip hop group called Boyzin in 2009. “But the group was not growing because of the lack of dedication among members. “I then went solo in 2011,” Chunky said. He grew in the music industry and switched from hip hop to Afro-pop. He was still studying at college when he made that switch. “In 2013 I met different artists at KSD TVET College in Mthatha,” he said. “People such as Charisma, Mr Elle and DJ X inspired me to switch from hip hop to Afro-pop.” He released his first single, Sorry, in 2014. Chunky has shared the stage with famous artists such as Berita, Naak Musiq, JR and Okmalumkoolkat.
