INCOMPLETE trial records have caused a delay in the case of fraud and money laundering against Portia “Pankie” Sizani. Sizani, the wife of Mzansi’s ambassador to Germany, Stone Sizani, appeared briefly in the Port Elizabeth Specialised Commercial Crimes Court yesterday for fraud and money laundering to the tune of R1,2 million. She’s accused of creating “ghost” teachers and pocketing their salaries between 2009 and 2010. She was found not guilty on five of the 15 charges against her for money laundering. But she still faces 16 counts of fraud and 10 counts of money laundering. On Monday, state prosecutor Ronelle Brink told the court the trial transcripts were not complete as some information was not typed up and some page numbers were incorrect. She said the CDs she supplied were clear and without problems. “I was surprised over the weekend when I noticed the transcripts were not correct. “There are missing pages and also the numbering is incorrect,” said Brink. She said she had notified the service provider to correct their mistake and retype the missing pages. Sizani’s counsel, Advocate Johan Wessels, said: “My client travelled from Germany to attend this trial. Now we are being told there are problems with transcripts.” He said the state should go back to their service provider to avoid the problem in future. Magistrate Mputhumi Mpofu postponed the case to 14 December for the state to file heads of argument and for the defence to reply on 21 January.
