THE Mamelodi Sundowns orchestra has a new conductor ... Gaston Sirino. The sizzling forward has once again showed he is the man to take over the playmaker role left by Percy Tau, as he inspired the Brazilians to a 3-1 league victory over Free Star Stars at Loftus Versfeld last night. This was as Sundowns fine-tuned themselves for the looming showdown with rivals Orlando Pirates on Saturday. Sirino scored twice, with Jeremy Brockie netting the other goal. Harris Tchilimbou scored for Stars. But it is the five-star performance of Sirino which would have pleased Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane ahead of the big weekend clash. The Brazilians have been crying out for a playmaker since the departure of the deadly attacking duo of Tau and Khama Billiat. Yet in Sirino they could well have found an apt replacement, judging by his ever-improving performances. The home side got off to a blistering start, Brockie breaking his goal duck for the Brazilians. Brockie played a one-two with Lebohang Maboe before rifling in a fine opening goal, just 12 minutes into the game. Sirino extended the lead, netting from a penalty spot after Bangaly Keita brought down Aubrey Ngoma inside the box in the 24th minute. Three minutes later, the diminutive Uruguay forward banged in the second, a stunning goal, from just metres outside the box. Tchilimbou pulled one back, beating a static Reyaad Pieterse at the near post with a low shot from a Judas Moseamedi cross. But soon Sundowns maintained their dominance and It could have been worse for Ea Lla Koto in the second half, had Sundowns finished off plenty more chances. The finishing remains an area of concern for Mosimane heading into the epic weekend clash. But he might want to have a word with Pieterse, who is as shaky as a nervous drunken gambler between the poles. His counterpart Sangare Ali, on the other hand, denied Sirino a hat-trick and Brockie a double.
