THE ANC is accusing mayor Thulasizwe Buthelezi of running the Zululand Municipality like his own spaza shop. ANC chief whip Mxolisi Zulu told Daily Sun Buthelezi was unruly and arrogant. He said he was shocked when he saw the employment of a new municipal manager on the agenda. “We discussed the matter before and told him it was illegal to hire a new manager while the old manager’s dismissal was still in court,” he said. He said Traditional Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube warned him to withdraw the advertisement for the new manager’s job until the court matter was finalised. Zulu said that if the mayor forces the item on the agenda there would be chaos. IFP caucus leader councillor Bheki Mncwango confirmed that the matter of a new manager was on the agenda and would be discussed. Daily Sun has seen a letter from Dube-Ncube warning the mayor not to continue with employing a new manager. She warned councillors that they will pay from their own pockets if the municipality loses the case against the previous manager’s dismissal in court.
