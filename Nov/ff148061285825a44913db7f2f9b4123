A video of seven under-aged learners from a Bloemfontein school smoking what appears to be dagga in an apple bong has surfaced on social media. The Free State Department of Education has confirmed the incident to OFM News and has urged members of the public to not share the video on social media platforms, identifying them. OFM quoted the departmental spokesperson, Howard Ndaba, saying because the incident took place in May earlier this year, the learners will not be suspended immediately and be allowed to continue with their exams, as five of them are, according to the South African Schools Act, still a compulsory school-going age. Ndaba said all learners are expected to appear before the School Governing Body in a disciplinary hearing today with their parents present. VIDEO COURTESY OF OFM
