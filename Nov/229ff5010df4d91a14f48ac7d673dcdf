THE thug thought the school was an easy target, but an alert security guard heard a noise and spotted the man on CCTV. The guard called the cops who watched on the screen as the man slipped like a snake through the iron burglar bars of the administration block. And then they pounced! The failed burglary at the Hermanstad Primary school in Hercules, Tshwane has gone viral on social media. In the video, the thug realises he has nowhere to run after barely being able to squeeze through the first time and surrenders. Police spokesman Constable Simon Chokoe said the man was searched and arrested for business burglary. He said the suspect was expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrates Court soon. Social media users also reacted. Some laughed at the dumb suspect while others praised the cops. Tim Trexler wrote on Facebook: “If only he put this effort into getting a job.” But Rasta Russell replied: “Criminals will always be criminals.”
