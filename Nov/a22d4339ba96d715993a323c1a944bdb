ZCC gospel group Wacha Mkhukhu said its subgenre is not adequately represented. The group has slammed Thobela FM for not including it in its gospel festival. The line-up includes Rebecca Malope, Sipho Makhabane, Winnie Mashaba, Solly Moholo, Andile KaMajola, as well as Takie and Rofhiwa. Wachumlilo Production’s Sivenathi Cekiso said: “It can’t be right that such a big event doesn’t have ZCC music representation, considering the station’s listenership consists of ZCC members.” SABC spokeswoman Neo Momodu said Thobela FM hosts the gospel festival every year, and the line-up changed every year. “The station is committed to ensuring different genres are included,” Momodu told Daily Sun. “This year’s line-up is made up of traditional, Zion and general gospel.”
