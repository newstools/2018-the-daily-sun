MTN users were shocked when it recently emerged that Kgomotso Christopher, who plays YV on e.tv’s Scandal!, is the voice that tells them they don’t have enough airtime to make a call. This came after actor Kgomotso posted a video of herself on social media. She was recording a voice- over for the cellphone company’s interactive voice response. She captioned the clip: “Greetings from the MTN lady who tells you when you have insufficient airtime to make this call.” Some social media users said they had always believed it was a white woman’s voice they were hearing, while others congratulated her on her voice-over talent. Carol Mbalati wrote on Instagram: “I feel so betrayed because all these years my love for you was too strong, only to find out you were the one telling me I have insufficient funds.” Chinie Plentee wrote: “You are beautiful @kgomotso_christopher and your voice is heavenly.” The clip got more than 40 000 views. Kgomotso responded to most of the comments with laughing emojis. Mthokozisi Ndlovu, a public relations specialist at the company, confirmed Kgomotso had done voice-over work for them.
