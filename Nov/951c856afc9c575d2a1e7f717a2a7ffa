BLACK Friday always promises discounts to die for! And this year even the dead will benefit from the slashed prices. One tombstone company had social media all abuzz after it announced on Facebook that it was going to discount tombstone prices for Black Friday. Many welcomed the gesture, saying that it was good to be alive. But the offer is not a grave bonanza for those who are still to be buried, but rather a discount on tombstones for those who have already passed on. Speaking to Daily Sun, Montes Lira from the company said they cared about the dead and they were offering discounts so families could buy stones. “We want to be part of Black Friday. We normally have month-to-month specials and promotions running on our website and Facebook page, but this will be the first time we are doing Black Friday,” said Lira. “It has only been a few days, but we are already getting good feedback.” Lira said they were committed to commemorating life, love and legacy. “We are always ready to be of service to our clients.”
