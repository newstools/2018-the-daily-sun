AS A MAGOSHA, she had seen many clients come and go.But the past weekend she experienced something she wished she had never seen.A MAN WHO BOUGHT HER SERVICES DIED ON TOP OF HER WHEN HE SAW HEAVEN ARRIVE!People said the hotel in Roodepoort where the incident happened was well known as a sex stadium and that the man was the third one to die there while poking. “We don’t know what these magoshas are doing to them. Maybe it’s excitement that kills them,” a hawker who trades nearby told Daily Sun. The magosha, who later spoke to the SunTeam about the ordeal, said the man was on top of her when he started struggling to breath. “I called out his name and started to speak to him but he stopped responding,” she said. Seeing that the man was not moving, she shifted him to the side of the bed. Terrified by what had just happened, she called the manager of the hotel to see the man lying motionless on the bed, and paramedics and the cops were called. “I was shocked. This is the first time I’ve came across something like this. “It is scary for a person to die on top of you, more so if you don’t know him,” the magosha said. Another magosha said: “You need to be cleansed because it’s bad luck for this to happen.” The man, who is believed to be from Tshepisong near Kagiso, was certified dead at the scene. Magoshas milled around at the front gate of the hotel where they waited for their customers. Daily Sun  reported a similar incident two years ago at the same hotel. The dead man’s friend said before going to the hotel, the man was drinking with them. “He left, saying he was going home, but we saw him picking up the magosha and they went into the hotel together. “We later saw the cops cordoning off the hotel and then heard that he had died during sex. “It’s sad and terrifying for a man to die in that manner,” he said. The manager of the hotel confirmed the incident. Roodepoort cop shop’s spokeswoman, Sergeant Juliet Mogale, said an inquest docket was opened.
