THE second witness in the murder trial of final year medical student Lwando Mantshontsho, took the stand at the Mthatha High Court yesterday. Solomzi Fobo, who works at the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital, was asked by the defence lawyer, Vuyani Gwebindlala, what he saw in the dead man’s room. He replied that he’d seen glasses with blood on them, spots of blood and a messy room. Gwebindlala produced four different photos which were taken on the day of the incident. He asked the witness to state if they were familiar. Fobo said two photos resembled Kuwait residence. State prosecutor Donè Triesch objected to Fobo answering questions about the photos. Judge Buyiswa Majiki also said she was lost as photographs are normally given to the court first. However, Gwebindlala said he was merely trying to get the witness familiar with the environment and for the photos to be accepted provisionally by the court. He said two of the photos with bent burglar bars showed where accused Siphesihle Mafungwa (22) and Yamkela Mxokozeli (24) were forcefully dragged. The duo, along with Sindile Khango (22), Philani Danca (24) and Lwakhe Matakanye (21) are facing a charge of murder, two counts of attempted murder and three counts of housebreaking, with intent to commit an offence. Mantshontsho was killed in May 2017 in his Atlanta residence room at Walter Sisulu University. The trial was attended by the family members of the accused as well as Mantshontsho’s family. The case continues.
