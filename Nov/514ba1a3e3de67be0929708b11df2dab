A SIXTY-THREE-year-old gogo was brutally murdered by her
own son, apparently because he believed she had become some kind of demon. According to Coconuts, the unnamed woman from Negros
Occidental in the Philippines had been at home on Sunday with three of her
grandkids, all under the age of 10. Suddenly her 42-year-old son arrived. He moered her over
the head with a spade, causing her to collapse unconscious. He then dragged her to the longdrop where he set her body
on fire. The grandkids fled to neighbours, who called the cops. The man claimed to have believed his mum was an “aswang”,
with her eyes demon-red and her tongue sticking out of her mouth in a weird
way. An aswang is a local magical demon that can assume different
forms. They are often believed to be females who eat foetuses or young kids. The man, who reportedly confessed to the murder, is in
cop custody. It is suspected he is mentally ill. According to neighbours, he had neither slept nor eaten for
at least three days before he killed his mum. He is due to be charged with parricide (the killing of a
parent or other near relative).
