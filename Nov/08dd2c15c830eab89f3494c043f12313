ACCORDING to Home Affairs, gogo Nyanisi Chauke had her first child when she was four years old! Gogo Nyanisi from Phaphazela Village outside Malamulele, Limpopo said she was born in 1944 but her ID book says she was born in 1964. Her younger sister Anna Bila’s ID shows that she was born in 1948, which means she is 16 years older than her older sister! The gogo told Daily Sun she has tried many times to fix the mistake at Home Affairs. “I went to Home Affairs offices in Vuwani, Malamulele and Makwarela several times to submit the documents, including my dompas and a letter from the church, but they sent me home without helping me,” she said. “I’m so tired of Home Affairs.” Anna said her sister was robbed of her age because she was young when they were making up the dompas and she didn’t understand the numbers. She said: “It hurts to see my sister struggling to fix the mistake because she should be enjoying the benefits we are getting from the government like the pension grant,” said Anna. Thabo Mokgola, spokesman for Home Affairs, said the matter has been referred to the office of the Home Affairs manager in Limpopo for investigations. He said a representative will soon contact gogo Nyanisi.
