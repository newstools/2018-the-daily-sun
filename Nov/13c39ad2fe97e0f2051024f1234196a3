DOMESTIC workers have had enough! A number of them told Daily Sun they were gatvol of being abused by their employers. Anna Magongwa (63) said she was stabbed by her employer’s son in Laudium, Tshwane, in September after being told she was fired. “We are still treated badly despite the hard work we do. We’re not appreciated,” she said. Anna said she was left with injuries that made it difficult for her to support her kids. She said after working for three years, she only got R2 900 from the CCMA. Susan Motha (31) from Mamelodi East in Tshwane said her family was still struggling after the death of her mum Johanna in 2016. She said her mum, who was the breadwinner, was bitten by her boss’ dog. She died a day after being released from hospital. Johanna Mahlangu said she was fired after being involved in a bus crash in 2013 while Maria Mahlangu (44) drowned in her employer’s swimming-pool in 2012. United Domestic Workers of South Africa president Pinky Mashiane said the labour minister needed to make sure domestic workers were compensated if injured at work. Police spokesman Constable Simon Chokoe said Anna’s alleged attacker was bust and had appeared in the Atteridgeville Magistrates Court. His case was postponed to 11 December.
