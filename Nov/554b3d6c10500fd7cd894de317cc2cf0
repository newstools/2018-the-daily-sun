LAST week, Police Minister Bheki Cele revealed that over 230 robbers were arrested and taken off the streets. But it appears not all of them are behind bars. On Friday, a cash-in-transit van was attacked in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. According to police, the thugs used explosives to tear the armoured van apart, causing the truck and one of the cars used in the heist to go up in flames. The thugs abandoned the vehicle. A shoot-out between the guards, police and thugs resulted in which a traffic officer was shot and injured. Police spokesman Vishnu Naidoo said: “A Mercedes intercepted the cash van by ramming into it. Two other vehicles arrived with robbers in them armed with handguns and rifles. “The suspects got access to the money by using explosives and fled with an undisclosed amount. At this point, no arrests have been made.” He said the suspects were travelling in three vehicles, two of them in double-cab bakkies. Vishnu said Cele announced that cash-in-transit heists will be prioritised, along with border control and crimes against women and children. Even though they were making progress in arresting cash-in-transit robbers, he said they still had a lot of work to do. “Thirty suspects have been arrested while still planning to commit these cash-in-transit robberies, at least some of whom were in the top 20 most wanted suspects.”
