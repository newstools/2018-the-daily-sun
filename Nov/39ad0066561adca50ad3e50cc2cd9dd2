Local actress and TV presenter, Bonnie Mbuli will make her acting return in 2019 when a new international series debuts. It’s been almost three years since we’ve seen Bonnie the actress in action and she is just as excited as her legions of fans are. “Bonnie the Actress is back! Can’t breathe, trying to stay calm, so thrilled and honored to be part of this incredible story and cast,” she said on social media. Bonnie will star in a new drama series called Noughts & Crosses that is set for global release in 2019. Noughts & Crosses will be the TV adaptation of Malorie Blackman’s popular novel series of the same name. The Noughts & Crosses series of novels describe an alternative history in which African people had gained a technological and organisational advantage over European people, rather than the other way around. In this reversal of established history, taking place in an alternate 21st-century Britain, the Africans make slaves of the European people. The TV series, in which Bonnie will star, is produced by Mammoth Screen in collaboration with Participant Media and Jay-Z’s entertainment company, Roc Nation who will also produce the soundtrack for the series. According to Variety Magazine, the series “follows two young people, Sephy and Callum, who are divided by their color but united by burning injustice. Sephy is a “Cross,” a member of the black ruling class and daughter of a prominent politician. Callum is a “Nought,” a white member of the underclass who were once slaves to the Crosses”. It not yet clear which character Bonnie will play, or when exactly the series will be released, but we do know that it is being made for the BBC and will come out sometime in 2019.
