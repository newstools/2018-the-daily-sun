THE high-mast light pole in Obert Mahlangu’s yard is making his life difficult. The 48-year-old from Sizanani squatter camp in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, said the light, which hasn’t been working for two years, is in his way. “It would be better if it was giving light to residents, but it’s standing where I want to build a four-roomed house for my family,” said Obert. He said he has complained to the municipality but nothing was done. They told him the pole was temporary. “My eight-year-old grandson, who’s living with a disability, cries whenever he sees the mast light. “It doesn’t make me feel good when he screams.” Obert said whenever his grandson goes outside, he becomes upset and the family will only have peace of mind when the light is removed. “I’m scared one day it will fall over and kill us,” he said. Obert said he has been looking at highmast lights wherever he goes and noticed none of them have been put in people’s yards. They’re outside their homes. Tshwane utility services mayoral committee member Darryl Moss said the municipality would send officials in the next few days to deal with the issue.
