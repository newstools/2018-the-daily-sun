AN insect bite changed Christopher Sibuyi’s life for the worse! Christopher (53) from Palm Ridge, Gauteng, said the problem started after he moved in with his girlfriend Arlinda Nhwale (43) in 2015. “The bite started as a small pimple. Two months later, they had spread all over my body,” said Christopher. Christopher said the medical attention he sought didn’t help. “I was in pain, so I went to the clinic. They gave me tubes of cream and told me to apply them daily. Even though I had no faith in them, I used them as instructed.” Arlinda said: “We’ve spent more than R10 000 on sangomas, but none of them came close to fixing the problem,” said Arlinda. The couple said they wanted SunLanders to pray for them.
