WESTERN Cape Health MEC Dr Nomafrench Mbombo visited Nomzamo in Strand to raise awareness about the beginning of paediatric surge season. This period occurs when there is increase in incidents of diarrhoea, with children under the age of five being particularly affected. “Paediatric surge season takes place during November to May. “Over the past five years, we’ve reduced the number of deaths associated with diarrhoea,” said the MEC. “However, the rise in reported diarrhoea cases over summer remains a concern.” During the 2017/2018 season, over 1 million children were treated in the province. “Our interventions have kept the death toll relatively low, but we need communities to work with us.” The areas most affected are those with no access to clean water and good sanitation. The MEC also used the opportunity to launch a new clinic card. “The previous card focused on immunisation, but this one has more information for the caregivers. “This will encourage parents to weigh their child at a clinic so they can see if the child needs help.” The MEC visited Philiswa Xaki (32), who is looking after her 16-day-old child at home. “The information on the card is very helpful because I didn’t know about the shoelace routine used to measure my child’s growth. “I wasn’t expecting the visit but it was very helpful,” she said Philiswa. Thina Sidumo (28), another parent, said: “This card will save me a lot of time. “Sometimes I go to the clinic for procedures I could’ve done myself if I’d had the information available.”
