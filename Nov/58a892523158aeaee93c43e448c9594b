YESTERDAY kids were given all sorts of toys by the Motsepe Foundation. The initiative, led by businessman Patrice Motsepe and his wife Dr Precious Moloi-Motsepe, saw more than 10 000 kids being given gifts at Orlando Stadium in Soweto. It was part of the foundation’s annual drive, which they have tied to the Global Citizen Festival this year. The concert will take place at FNB Stadium, Soweto on Sunday. The event was attended by super- model Naomi Campbell, DJ Tira, Kwesta, Dr Malinga and AKA. Speaking to the SunTeam, Precious said: “Seeing kids so happy warms my heart. It took a lot of planning. We worked with schools and creches, especially in densely populated areas where a lot of poor people live. “We organised with the education department to divide the children into groups so we could give the right toy to the right child. “By April the toys were ordered, and in June we knew who we would be working with. It’s a lot of planning, but seeing it come together makes it all worthwhile.” She told Daily Sun the foundation’s focus was on reducing poverty in the country and across the continent with sustainable projects. Campbell said people could expect everyone participating in the concern to give from their hearts. “We will be putting messages across that the world should know. We would like world leaders coming to make pledges to stop global hunger by 2030. We hope by bringing us all together, they will see the importance of the message and do something about it,” she said.
