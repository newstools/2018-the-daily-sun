POWER cuts at the Lenasia Magistrates Court, south of Joburg, have led to the Vlakfontein murder case being postponed again – and transferred to another court. The court has been experiencing power cuts since Tuesday. Ernest Mabaso (27) and Fifita Khupe (61) were expected to apply for bail. They’re facing seven counts of murder and theft. They were found with bank cards belonging to two of the victims. Mabaso is also facing three additional charges of rape. Magistrate Maggie van der Merwe transferred the matter to the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto for a bail application today. The men were bust in connection with the murder of members of the Khoza family. Their bodies were found by cops last month after neighbours alerted them to a foul smell. Mabaso was nabbed in Mpumalanga near the Lebombo border post while Khupe was bust in Dobsonville. On Tuesday, Vlakfontein residents gathered outside court and demanded that the men not be given bail. Councillor Ace Mokoenyane told Daily Sun: “We’ve put together a petition signed by Vlakfontein residents and neighbouring communities.”
