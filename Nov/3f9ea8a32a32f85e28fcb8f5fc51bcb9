THE Department of Education is not pleased at pupils who
do the #IdibalaChallenge at school. Following a video in which pupils of Akasia High School
were recorded doing the #IdibalaChallenge in class, the department said that it
will not tolerate ill-discipline. In the video, the learners seem to have shocked the
teacher, who, in a later clip, indicated she did not want them in her class for
the rest of the term. “Learners must be reminded that schools are for
education, and as such they must always focus on being enriched with knowledge
for their successful future endeavours,” Education spokesperson Steve Mabona
said. “Ill-discipline will not assist learners to achieve any
objectives in schools.” Mabona strongly condemned the video, which he said seeks
to undermine the dignity of both learners and educators. “MEC Panyaza Lesufi has identified learner discipline as
one of the priorities of the Department,” he said. “This is a critical time where schools are administering
examinations and such behaviour must be discouraged and will not be tolerated,”
he also told Daily Sun. The transport department has also warned people not to do
the #IdibalaChallenge while driving.
