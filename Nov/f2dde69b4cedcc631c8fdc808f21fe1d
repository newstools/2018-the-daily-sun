WHEN 15-year-old Kea heard her sister Yanga Sobetwa (17) had won Idols SA, she fainted on the spot. After coming round, she said: “I feel blessed. I can’t explain the feeling I got when they announced Yanga had won. I felt God is in control.” Kea was one of about 2 000 people who had filled the Voorburg Sport field in Delft, Cape Town. They watched on the big screen as Yanga walked away with the prestigious prize at Carnival City in Ekurhuleni on Sunday evening. There were door-to-door campaigns leading up to the final day. Sunday’s event was organised by Councillor Michelle Adonis and a group of supporters who dubbed themselves Team Yanga. The crowd was joined by Western Cape Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela and Health MEC Dr Nomafrench Mbombo. This is the second year the crown has landed in Cape Town. Presenter Proverb said the show had received a record of over 142 million votes. MEC Mbombo said she took this competition personally because of what it would mean for Yanga and also for Delft. Adonis, who was also in tears, said Yanga was a beacon of hope to many young people. “Every week we read about crime and young people being gunned down in Delft but now there’s Yanga! A beacon of hope who will inspire others with the endless possibilities.” MEC Madikizela said when Yanga’s sister collapsed she knew what it meant to her family. “I can’t put into words how I feel right now,” she said.
