CONSTABLE Bhamuza Sicongwana and businessman Aslam Gangat organised a two-roomed house for gogo Khatshiwe Mbedla on Friday. When Sicongwana saw the terrible conditions in which the gogo’s family from Mnceba Village in Ntabankulu, Eastern Cape were living, he decided to step in. “It was raining when I stopped by to see how gogo was doing and I found the family sitting in a corner to hide from the rain,” he said. “It brought tears to my eyes and I felt I had to do something. “I then roped in Aslam’s help. “He was also in tears when I showed him the pictures of the house. “He built the new house and supplied them with furniture and groceries.” The 73-year-old gogo lives with her epileptic daughter and mentally handicapped grandson. “We are all on treatment. “Our mud house made our ailing health worse. “We were falling apart. “I’m grateful to this young man for rescuing us. I feel like a human being again.” Gogo’s daughter, Nontembiso Mbedla (51), said she felt helpless. “It’s not easy finding a job with my sickness. “I couldn’t build a house for her, like others did for their parents,” Nontembiso said. Nomfanekiso Nonkondlo of Saverite Supermarket said after their bosses saw the photos of the gogo’s house, they decided to get involved. “Within three weeks we were able to build the house, supply the furniture and give them groceries,” she said. Mount Ayliff cluster commander Brigadier Mthuthuzeli Mtukushe praised Gangat and Sicongwana. “We may be cops but we have hearts. We thank everyone for their help in restoring the gogo’s dignity,” Mtukushe said.
