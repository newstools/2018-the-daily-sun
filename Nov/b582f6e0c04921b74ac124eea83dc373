AS far as Home Affairs records are concerned, Katlego Magolego (30) doesn’t exist. When she visits their offices the system only recognises her twin sister. Katlego shares her ID numbers with Khomotso (30), the twin sister. The sisters are from Alexandra, north of Joburg. Khomotso is married and, according to Home Affairs, the name of her sister’s husband is also Katlego. The fingerprints on the ID book are hers but the name is Khomotso’s. Katlego recently got a job but didn’t get paid as she couldn’t open a bank account. Her six-year-old daughter is about to start school. “She needs a certificate for registration,” she said. “I’m afraid my baby will be sitting at home doing nothing, come next year.” Her biggest fear? If her sister dies she, too, will be declared dead. “Why can’t Home Affairs just change one ID number? I really am tired of this,” said Katlego. “I can’t even open clothing accounts. I need this to be sorted before the worst happens.” Khomotso said: “This needs to be fixed. It causes problems for both of us,” she said. “I hope Home Affairs comes through. We hate living like this.” Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola referred the matter to the provincial manager’s office. She said as much as she loves her sister, she does not like the idea of sharing the same ID number with her. “This kind of error isn’t common. We’ll have this fixed as soon as possible. An official will contact the client.”
