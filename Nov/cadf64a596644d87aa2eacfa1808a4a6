IT WAS a colourful send-off indeed for HHP, also known as “Jabba”. In the parking areas, cars played the late star’s music at top volume. And inside, the venue almost resembled a jam session. Premier Job Mokgoro recited his song Harambe, and MEC Ontlametse Mochware rapped HHP classics as she read a speech from the Arts Ministry. The funeral service of HHP, born Jabulani Tsambo (37), was held at the Mmabatho Convention Centre in Mahikeng, North West, on Saturday. Lerato Sengadi, who was declared Jabba’s wife by the court on Friday, after failing to stop the funeral, arrived late, accompanied by some of HHP’s friends. She was seated silently in the same row with the Tsambo family but at a distance. She clapped hands when HHP’s sister, Ayanda Tsambo, shared good memories of him. Joining the family and artists, she threw soil into the grave to say goodbye to her famous husband. Speakers called on the government to honour HHP for his role in making Tswana fashionable and for developing other artists. In a letter read on her behalf, Jabba’s mum Theriso Tsambo, said she still couldn’t believe he was gone. “A part of me is gone since you have died. You started off being a son and ended up a good friend and a confidant. A lot of families never had that privilege.” Speakers described him as a giant in stature who had a kind heart. Premier Job Mokgoro, referring to HHP as Ntja ya game (dog of the game), said he was a social poet and revolutionary. He praised Jabba for standing with students during the FeesMustFall movement. Chiefs, officials, entertainers and scores of fans attended the funeral service.
