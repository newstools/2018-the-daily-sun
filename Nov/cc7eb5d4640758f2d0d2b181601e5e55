 Durban-based Mzwandile 'Shakebone' Hlongwa landed what is being called the 'knockout of the year' at EFC 75 at GrandWest in Cape Town on Saturday. A devastating spinning elbow - or what has been referred to on social media as the 'Hellbow' - at 1:11 in Round 1 saw Norway's Torbjørn Madsen knocked out cold. Madsen was taken to hospital as a precaution for further medical checks and has since been discharged. Predictably, Hlongwa was awarded a performance bonus post-event for his knockout. Hlongwa was part of Season 1 of 'The Fighter' reality show and his record now stands at 3-1-1.  SOURCE: SPORT24
