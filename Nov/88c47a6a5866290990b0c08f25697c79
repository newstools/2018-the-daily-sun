IT MAY not be rich in tradition nor ranked among the renowned derbies, but the Tshwane derby holds a special place in PSL history. Matches between Mamelodi Sundowns and SuperSport United are rarely short of goals, excitement and quality. As Pitso Mosimane remarked, the Soweto derby is the biggest in spectatorship. But in football terms, the Tshwane derby is the biggest. The two renew hostilities at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Sunday (3pm) in their 54th league clash. “It’s a good game. On the pitch it’s the biggest derby, in the grandstands it is not,” said Mosimane, who has been instrumental in the evolution of the “Tshwane Clasico”, having been on both of the team benches over the years. “You must understand how old SuperSport United and Mamelodi Sundowns are. We don’t have the tradition of decades to build on in this derby,” added the Downs coach. The occasion is not, however, about Mosimane and his United counterpart Kaitano Tembo. It is rather about the players, who shoulder the expectation of victory. No one will be feeling that pressure more than in-form Sundowns hitman Jeremy Brockie, coming up against his former side. The Kiwi has rediscovered his old form and sounds pumped for the showdown. “I have a knack of scoring against my old clubs and now that I have found the back of the net a couple of times, I don’t have stress about it anymore,” said Brockie, who scored a stunner in the Caf Champions League opener against Leones Vegetarianos midweek. “It’s important that we get results in the league. Games are coming thick and fast and we have the squad to compete. But we need to get maximum points on Sunday.” SuperSport come into the match on the back of a goalless draw with Bloemfontein Celtic. But it says a lot about their form that Ronwen Williams was Man of the Match. James Keene, though, poses a serious threat, having plugged the gap left by injured Bradley Grobler.
