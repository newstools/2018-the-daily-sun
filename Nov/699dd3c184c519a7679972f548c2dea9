Singer and record producer Tellaman has constantly given his fans one hit after another ever since he broke into the music industry back in 2014. The talented Durban born singer became a household name when his song Drinks and Music, was featured on the hugely successful Soul Candi Sessions 15 compilation that sold Gold. While his sound might have evolved since then, his ability to make quality music has ensured that his star continues to rise. The 27 year old has released another song that promises to tear up the club scene, Crew Lit. The song follows another single he released a few months ago titled No Sharing, which was well received by his fans. "Crew Lit is a party song. It talks about how lit myself and my friend or crew or gang are. Basically, I have never seen people who can party like my crew and who are as cool as my crew. But I guess thatâ€™s how everyone feel about their friends, or I hope they do." Tellaman, whose real name is Thelumusa Owen, says he has a lot in store for his fans in the coming months. His eagerly anticipated debut album, God Decides, is done and is set for release in February 2019, much to the delight of is adoring fans who can hardly wait for the project. "A lot of people expect me to be on my second or third album by now but i just like to take my time with the music," he told the Daily Sun. "I feel like the effort i put into making singles is the same effort i put into making each song in the album, the quality is still the same and my fans will appreciate that all good things take time."
