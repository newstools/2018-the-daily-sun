SHE lost her first child a week ago. And then Gwezi Mahlangu (29) went through the pain of carrying her dead baby in her womb for seven days. Her husband, Elvis Mhaule (39), from Ekangala Dark City in Bronkhorstspruit, is fuming. “I’m not happy with the way my wife was treated at Mamelodi Day Hospital in Tshwane. They kept her for a week with a dead foetus in her womb,” Elvis said. He said when Gwezi went to Mamelodi Day Hospital they thought she would be in good care. But all his hope faded when his wife wasn’t treated after it was discovered the foetus had died. Elvis said they rushed Gwezi, who was in pain, to a private doctor in Bronkhorospruit last Tuesday and later to Mamelodi as her condition deteriorated. He said the doctor in Mamelodi told them the child’s heart wasn’t beating and declared the foetus dead. According to Elvis, the doctor recommended tablets to induce natural birth on Thursday, but they didn’t work. She was then given other tablets to help her give birth but those too failed. He said it was a torture to see his wife carrying a dead foetus for a week. “Losing a child has left me with many questions,” said Gwezi. He is worried his wife might not be able to conceive as a result of the bad treatment she received at the hospital. Gwezi was taken to Steve Biko Academic Hospital on Monday and was treated on Tuesday. The operation went well. Communications manager Aobakwe Selebogo of Mamelodi Hospital said: “Induction of labour was carried out according to maternity guidelines. Upon review by a senior doctor another sonar was done to find out if she was not responding as expected. “The doctor’s findings are what informed the hospital’s decision to transfer her to Steve Biko Academic Hospital,” said Selebogo.
