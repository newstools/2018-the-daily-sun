The Proteas are gearing up for what promises to be an exciting home season of cricket as they face Pakistan and Sri Lanka. They will kick off their home season with the first of three Test matches against sixth ranked Pakistan on Boxing Day, 26 December. The Proteas will be hoping to regain second position in the Test rankings from England who overtook them after the 3-0 thrashing of Sri Lanka. The attention will then switch to the shorter formats as the two teams will do battle in 5 ODIs and three T20s early next year. Shortly after the conclusion of the Pakistan tour, the Proteas will welcome Sri Lanka. They will face off in two Test matches, 5 ODIs and three T20 Internationals. “As we prepare for a bumper home season with both Pakistan and Sri Lanka visiting our shores, we can all look forward to a programme of top class international cricket,” csaid CSA Chief Executive, Thabang Moroe. ”Pakistan, who are our guests during the holiday period and the festive season, will be extremely tough opposition that will provide just the test our Proteas need in their build-up to next year's ICC Men's World Cup in England," said Moroe. “They are currently the No 1 ranked side in T20 International cricket and the No. 5 ranked side in ODI cricket. Their performances in the latter format include victory in the 2017 edition of the ICC Champions Trophy tournament. “Their recent results in Test cricket include a series draw away to England earlier this year and a more recent victory over Australia on their neutral home ground. “In all, our fans can look forward to 5 Test matches, 10 One-Day Internationals and 6 T20 International matches during our action-packed home summer,” concluded Moroe.
