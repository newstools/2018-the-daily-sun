WITH the national elections drawing close, the ruling party is working hard to ensure there’s unity in the party. Secretary-general Ace Magashule and national spokesman Pule Mabe said they party also wanted to address the grievances of angry branches of the Dullah Omar region. They addressed party members at Nomzamo Community Hall in Strand, Cape Town on Wednesday. The party’s Cape Town leadership conference was marred by court interdicts from angry members. The interdicts failed to stop the conference but conflicts continued. Magashule urged members to stop fighting as the conference was now over. He also said the party wanted to take back the Western Cape from the DA. “The history of the party shows it was built by unity. “Let’s respect decisions taken by higher structures. Let’s go back to the ground and work together for our people. “The ANC during apartheid was an alternative government for our people. Do that here in the Western Cape because the DA will not serve our people. “Be visible. Go to taverns even if you don’t drink and attend community funerals. “The people must know the branch is alive,” said Magashule. Western Cape leader Xolani Sotashe said talks of divisions within the party must end. “We need to close ranks. The DA is bleeding and it was the ANC that exposed corruption in the DA,” he said. Sotashe slammed new Cape Town mayor Dan Plato, saying he had close ties with gangsters. “The legacy of Plato is gangsterism. How do you take someone who socialises with gangsters and make him a mayor? “Conferences have come and gone. We must close ranks now and focus on our people,” said Sotashe. The branches agreed to work together and revive the party.
