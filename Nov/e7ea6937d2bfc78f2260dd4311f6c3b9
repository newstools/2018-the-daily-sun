Survivors of the Parkland school shooting have been awarded
the International Children’s Peace Prize by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The shooting took place in Parklands, Florida in the United
States of America in February this year. Seventeen children reportedly died from the shooting. Organizers of the March For Our Lives David Hogg, Jaclyn
Corin and Matt Deitsch received the award this week at a ceremony held in Cape
Town, Western Cape. Hogg, Corin and Deitsch organized the march in protest
against gun violence and the demand for safer schools in the United Nations. Hundreds of thousands participated in the march, which
branched out to more than 800 sister marches. Speaking at the ceremony, Tutu said that he was in awe of
the children. “The peaceful campaign to demand safe schools and
communities and the eradication of gun violence is reminiscent of other great
peace movements in history,” he said. “I am in awe of these children, whose powerful message is
amplified by their youthful energy and an unshakable belief that children can
improve their own futures. “They are true change-makers who have demonstrated most
powerfully that children can move the world.” During the ceremony, KidsRights and International Children’s
Peace Prize founder Marc Dullaert called upon the international community to
halt the increasing school violence witnessed across the globe. The International Children’s Peace Prize is an initiative of
the international children’s rights organization KidsRights.
