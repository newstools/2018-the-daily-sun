NEHAWU is claiming to be corruption busters. However, union members in the health field earlier brought hospitals and clinics in the North West to their knees and even closed theatres. This time their allied workers in the education field brought chaos to the University of Mpumalanga. Students got the short end of the stick when alleged Nehawu members forcibly removed them from exam rooms and burned exam papers. The union and some students from the university handed over a memorandum of their grievances to the regional director of the department of higher education and training, Dr Simon Mlangeni, yesterday. They accused the vice-chancellor of the university, Thokozile Mayekiso, and her council of corruption and maladministration. Exams at the university ground to a halt on Tuesday. The union’s national secretary Zola Saphetha told Daily Sun their actions were directed at elevating the university issues to national level. “Universities are national assets and that’s why we are here. Our aim is to resolve issues.” “We will write a letter to the chancellor of the university Cyril Ramaphosa and relate our experiences, our areas of discontent and our impatience to tolerate this beyond today. It will be up to him to respond but we are certain we’ll mobilise beyond what we have done today.” He said the memorandum was supposed to have been accepted by Minister of Higher Education, Naledi Pandor. Saphetha said they were giving her 48 hours to respond.
