WHEN Michael Ede got up to take a pee on Sunday night, he
had no idea that his two little kids were dead in his freezer. According to Punch, Michael told cops that Emma Ede (6)
and Darasimi Ede (4) had been safely asleep with him in his bedroom in Lagos,
Nigeria. All the doors to his home were locked, said Michael. At about midnight on Sunday Michael woke up and went to
pee. It was then that he realised his kids had vanished from
his bedroom, said Michael. After searching high and low, he eventually discovered
them at about 2am in his deep freezer – dead. Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, CSP Chike
Oti, said the kids’ bodies had been transferred to the morgue. “We are investigating the matter and we have arrested the
kids’ father for questioning,” said Oti.
