The #Idibalachallenge has been trending for weeks in Mzansi – and now it seems to have gone international. The trend comes from King Monada’s latest single Malwedhe. The song and challenge has become an internet sensation, with fans recording themselves fainting while listening to the lyrics. A video of Chinese pupils is now trending on social media. In the video, as soon as the song refers to fainting, they all throw their heads to their desks as if they had fainted. Some even fall on the ground. Many Facebook users found the video funny. Papvinho Dadeejay wa Musiqwa wrote: “This one takes the trophy. So do they find our songs as irritating as we find theirs?” Wesi Masilo: “We’ve been told to learn Mandarin, now it’s their chance to learn our language.” Last week the Road Traffic Management Corporation issued a warning that the challenge of drivers pretending to faint posed a danger. “When drivers take their eyes off the road, they can cause a fatal crash,” a spokesman warned. “What they’re doing is the same as texting while driving.” ?????? #IdibalaChallenge has gone Global????
