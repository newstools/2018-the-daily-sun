A SOCIAL media post insisted it was bottoms up for Gabola Church’s Pope Tsietsi Makiti. But, like a proverbial bottomless drink, the Pope of booze and salvation isn’t done – not by a long shot! For days, Tweeps have been posting and sharing stories about the death of Gabola Church’s first resident. A story was posted online claiming that Makiti had died due to alcohol abuse. But the first “Black Pope” from Orange Farm, south of Jozi, said he’s not the dying type and would live to enjoy his cold beers. Speaking to Daily Sun, Tsietsi said he was killed by social media users. “But I’m alive and kicking, very healthy and strong for that matter. “The God I pray to is a true and living God of Gabola Church who keeps me breathing,” he said. He added that being killed on social media had left his family traumatised. “These fake news reports intend to discredit the work of Christ. “Many will say that when people kill you, it’s a curse. “But I know it is not a curse but a blessing as I will live to see more years to come,” said Tsietsi. “Even though this has left my family, friends and relatives traumatised, I pray each day and night for those who would kill me when I still have years ahead to carry on with the work of God. “For now I forgive my killers and know they will come and apologise for the harm they have done. “But if not, I will allow my legal advisers and the law to take its course.” “The church will continue to do wonders in terms of growing service delivery to our community.” Following the reports, many apparently took to social media to send their condolences on the death of the controversial church man.
