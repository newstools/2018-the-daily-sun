‘MY butt is real, but her butt is plastic!” So said Aline UVA, a sore loser at this year’s Miss
BumBum competition, according to the Sun. Now in its seventh year, this year’s edition of the
competition was held on Monday in Brazil. Aline just couldn’t stand that the title of Miss BumBum
2018 had gone to Ellen Santana (31). Ellen’s winner’s sash was ripped from her by Aline, but
she got it back in the end.
