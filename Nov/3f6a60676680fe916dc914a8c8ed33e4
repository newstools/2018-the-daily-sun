FOR weeks, the 41-year-old man reportedly threatened his dad that he would kill him. Then on Monday he allegedly stabbed the old man (68) to death. He then allegedly changed his bloodied clothes, cleaned the blood off the floor and went to buy beer at a tavern. When his mum arrived home in Swartboom, North West, she found her husband dead on the kitchen floor. She called the police. The mum (59) said she knew their son was the one who murdered her husband. “Two weeks ago he was arrested for attempting to kill his dad, but he was released. “Now he finished what he started,” said the mum. She said her son asked her for money before he killed her husband. “He said I should give him transport money because he wanted to go to court. I refused and went out. When I came back I found my husband dead,” said the mother. The mum said her son had been causing problems in their lives. “He has never worked. We took care of him, but he has always been troublesome.” She said she hoped he would rot in jail for what he did. “If he is released, he might kill me too. We do not know what his problem is, but we are not safe living with him,” she said. Another family member said police had failed them. “We asked the cops not to release him the first time because we knew how dangerous he is, but they said they could not keep him in jail. “Now he must be locked up for a long time,” she said. North West police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh said: “We can confirm that a case of murder has been opened. “A 41-year-old suspect was arrested on Monday and he will appear in court soon,” said Myburgh.
