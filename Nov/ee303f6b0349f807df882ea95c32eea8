CHURCH members got the shock of their lives when they were robbed of their cellphones and money on Sunday. Members of Higher Cross Baptist Church in Lower Crossroads, Philippi East, are still trying to wrap their heads around the surprising incident. Pastor Luvuyo Dwaba said the service was about to end when three thugs entered the church. “They ordered everyone to take out their cellphones and money,” said the pastor. “The men took my laptop and phone, but they didn’t stop there. “More than 10 cellphones were taken. “I don’t know how much money was stolen, but it was a lot.” Church member Nonkululeko Mangxola said she was too scared to go back to church. She said: “It will be hard to go back to church now that I know there are criminals who don’t fear God. “These criminals do as they please, but we’re grateful they didn’t kill or injure anyone.” Bishop Zamuxolo Mfihlo of the Apostolic Amen Church said increased police visibility was the answer to the problem. “Now that the thugs have started, they won’t stop,” said the bishop. He said although the thugs took money and cellphones, they might steal cars next time. “It’s clear these criminals aren’t afraid of God, so the police must protect us.” Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “The suspects fled from the scene on foot. “A business robbery case was opened.”
