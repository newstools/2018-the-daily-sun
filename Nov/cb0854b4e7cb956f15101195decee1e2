Lee Westwood bagged five birdies on his back nine to storm to victory in the Nedbank Golf Challenge at the Gary Player Country Club on Sunday, his first title on the European Tour for four years. Westwood, 45, carded a faultless 64 that included an eagle and six birdies for a tournament total of 15 under par, three shots ahead of overnight leader Sergio Garcia. The Spaniard, who had led from the first round into Sunday, could manage only a 70 as his two-shot overnight advantage was swallowed up by a magnificent finish from Westwood. The Englishman secured a 24th European Tour title, the eighth most of all time, and a third at the Nedbank Golf Challenge after previous wins in 2010, when he was ranked the number one golfer in the world, and 2011. Meanwhile, NEWS24 reports that local favourite Louis Oosthuizen couldn't capitalise and finished with a double bogey on the final hole. Oosthuizen signed a final round of three-under 61 to finish third on 11-under. Meanwhile, overnight leader Sergio Garcia carded a final round of 2-under 70 to finish second on 12-under. Last year's champion Branden Grace came back well and managed a two-under 70 to finish T11 at 3-under. The next golf event South Africa will host is the SA Open at Randpark Golf Club from 6-9 December, 2018.
