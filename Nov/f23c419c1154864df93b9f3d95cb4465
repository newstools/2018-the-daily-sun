A SAD mood filled the home of Shelton Karuweruwe as the family addressed the media about the murder of their six-year-old son on Thursday. Shelton, a grade 1 pupil, was stabbed to death in the toilets at Dikeledi Primary School, allegedly by a grade 11 pupil from another school, on Wednesday. North West Education MEC Sello Lehari visited the school and the boy’s family. He said he was saddened by Shelton’s death. Lehari questioned how the 17-year-old from a different school made his way into the school’s bathroom with a knife, without anyone noticing. He said security at schools in the province had to be prioritised. Lehari said that it wasn’t yet clear whether Shelton would be buried here or in his home country of Zimbabwe. “If they plan to bury him here we will assist with the funeral arrangements.” Lehari urged the community to refrain from taking the law into their own hands. He said there were reports about Satanism relating to the incident, but asked the residents to let police investigate the matter. Family spokeswoman Nathisah Nongo (27) said Shelton wanted to become a lawyer when he grew up. “His mum took him to school that morning and was called a few minutes later to hear that her son was dead.”
