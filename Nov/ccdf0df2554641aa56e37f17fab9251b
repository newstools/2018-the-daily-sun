Mazda is getting ready to show off its latest Mazda 3. The Japanese car maker has been teasing the car on their
social media And we are glad to report that from the little we can see
Mazda is keeping to the concept car they showed off at the 2017 Tokyo Motor
Show. Mazda described the Kai concept style as "clean, honed
beauty free of extraneous elements" And if Mazda manages to get as much of the design elements
from the Kai concept into production, then rivals in the segment would have a
lot to worry about. With many cars in the segment starting to look the same,
Mazda's evolution of the KODO design on the new 3 could make it a more
appealing package. The current Mazda 3 is fairly popular in the South Africa. It offers good design, a decent cabin and great driving
dynamics. Mazda's pricing has also been really competitive too. We know the 20-inch probably won't make into production but
Mazda needs to ensure that they offer some beefed up wheels. Most of the Mazda
3s we see on the road have wheels the size of bottle caps. Details are scarce on pretty much any detail except the
design right now. But Mazda says that the car will get "groundbreaking
next-generation SKYACTIV-X petrol engines that offer diesel levels of
efficiency. The engines are mated to an evolved version of their SKYACTIV-VEHICLE
ARCHITECTURE that promises unprecedented refinement and driving performance. The Kai concept's interior was the epitome of minimalism,
few physical buttons and a screen that is neatly integrated into the dash. Hope those elements make it into the production model too. Mazda will unveil the new Mazda 3 at the 2018 Los Angeles
Motor show that kicks off at the end of November.
