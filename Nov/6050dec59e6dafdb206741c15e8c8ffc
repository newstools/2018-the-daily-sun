THEY were apparently planning a cash-in-transit heist, but they didn’t know the police were watching them. One suspect died and another five were arrested on Thursday after the Hawks caught them. The thugs didn’t know the Hawks were watching the two cars they were travelling in. They allegedly planned to rob the cash van between Bethlehem and Kestell on the R57 highway in the Free State. Hawks spokesman Captain Sfiso Nyakane said: “Five suspects aged between 32 and 42 were arrested and charged with attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, while one suspect succumbed to gunshot wounds.” He said the serious organised crime investigation team assisted by crime intelligence, the special task force, dog unit and other special units stopped suspects who were allegedly going to commit the robbery. “The suspects were observed near Kestell in two different vehicles. The team confronted them and there was a shoot-out. Two rifles, three pistols and the two suspected stolen vehicles were seized,” he said. “The five suspects briefly appeared in the Phuthaditjhaba Magistrates Court on Thursday. They were kept in custody and will appear this Thursday. More charges are expected.” The national head of the directorate for priority crime investigation, Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya, praised the members for stopping the cash-in-transit robbery and arresting the suspects before they could carry out their attacks.
