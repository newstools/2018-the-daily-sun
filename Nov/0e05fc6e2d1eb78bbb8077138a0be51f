AFTER celebrating a successful season four with a party last week, Uzalo announced it has to say goodbye to some cast members. Three actors, Nokuthula Mabika, Glen Gabela and Nay Maps will not be part of season five, which starts in February. The show’s head writer, Bongi Ndaba said it was hard to say goodbye to the three actors. “In season five, viewers will see the departure of long-standing actors. “Season four brought incredible evolution and riveting storylines to our screens and our incredible cast delivered over and above every time. “We’re so grateful for the golden energy and dedication that these actors brought to Uzalo,” said Bongi. The SABC1 telenovela will introduce three new characters, who will join the cast in the new season. “The new cast members will be joining the show, while other existing roles will be amplified,” she said. Bongi said Uzalo viewers would see the character of Lilly, played by Noxolo Mathula, grow. The show will bring on some new talent like Thuthuka Mthembu and Nkanyiso Makhanya. In season four, Uzalo made history by reaching more than 10 million viewers. The show also won awards, including the Most Popular Soap at the Saftas.
