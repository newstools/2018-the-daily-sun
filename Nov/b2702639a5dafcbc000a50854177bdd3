THE Auditor General Kimi Makwetu has released combined audit
outcomes of national and provincial governments. Makwetu said while the audit results of 43 auditees
improved, those were overshadowed by the 73 that regressed from the previous year. The AG further noted that over the past four years since 2014-15,
there has been a similar pattern with more audit outcomes regressing than
improving. Makwetu says urgent interventions are needed at the Departments
of Education, Departments of Health and Public Works. He added that for years his office had reported weaknesses in
internal controls and the risks that needed attention at national and provincial
governments by providing root causes for audit findings and recommendations to
remedy these underlying causes.
