The Electoral
Commission of South Africa (IEC) has announced the final voter registration for national and provincial elections 2019. The country’s 22
932 voting stations will be open on 26 January and Sunday 27 January 2019. This will be to
allow new voters to register and existing voters to update and to check their
registration details. The Chairperson
of the Commission Glen Mashinini announced new commissioners Dr Nomsa Masuku,
who until her appointment served as Deputy Chief Electoral Officer for Outreach
and Mosotho Moepya, the former Chief Electoral Officer, and Judge Dhaya Pillay
of the KwaZulu-Natal High Court. Mashinini said there
are currently 26.1 million registered voters on the national common voters’
roll and at least one million voters will be added to the voters’ roll ahead of
the 2019 elections. “The Electoral
Commission is also hopeful that voters who are already registered will use the
opportunity to visit their voting station to check their registration and
specifically to confirm and update their address details,” Mashinini said. He added that this
forms part of the on-going drive to ensure the voters’ roll is ready for the
elections in line with the 2016 order of the Constitutional Court. “Over the past two
years the Electoral Commission has added over 13 million addresses to the
voters’ roll through a variety of initiatives bringing the total number of
voters with addresses on the voters’ roll to 21.4 million (82%) from just 8.4
million (32%) in March 2016,” He said. All South Africa
citizens aged 16 and older in possession of an official ID document can
register as voters, although only those who are at least 18 years old on voting
day may vote.
