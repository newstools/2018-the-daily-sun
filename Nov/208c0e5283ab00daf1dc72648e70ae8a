KWAMHLANGA residents are living in fear following the death of Hope Mahlangu (19). The teenager’s body was found by a herdboy at a dumpsite in Mahlabathini Village on Sunday. It was wrapped in a blanket. Police spokeswoman Captain Nonhlanhla Kgosana said a case of murder was opened. She said they needed residents’ help to bust the suspect. “We’re searching for the person who did this evil thing,” she said. “We hope the community will help us with information.” Hope’s mum Anna, said she hoped her daughter’s killer would be found. Anna from Vezubuhle in KwaMhlanga, told Daily Sun she last saw her daughter on Saturday afternoon. “I’d sent my daughter to her gogo’s place in Mandela Village to fetch stuff for me,” said Anna. “She should have been back home on Sunday. “The last time I was with her was at her aunt’s place. “She didn’t come home on Sunday. I received a call from her boyfriend. He told me they should have met on Saturday evening. “When he called Hope she had told him she was coming. “He said he waited for some time and called again, but Hope never came.” Anna said she was shocked when she got a call to come and identify a young woman’s body. She couldn’t recognise Hope because her face was swollen. Anna said she only recognised her by the clothes she was wearing. Captain Kgosana said anyone with information should call Colonel Rachel Manzini on 082 318 9651 or 082 922 9831.
