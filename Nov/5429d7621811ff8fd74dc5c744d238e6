A 29-YEAR-OLD man was rushed to Prince Mshiyeni Hospital yesterday after he was attacked by residents in Umlazi, KZN. The people attacked the man after they apparently discovered he had allegedly killed his girlfriend, Babalwa Mbhele (15). The suspect was rescued by family members. Babalwa’s sister, Silindile (30), said they were woken up at 2am yesterday by residents who came to tell them Babalwa had been stabbed. They rushed to the boyfriend’s shack and found Babalwa’s body there. “She was naked and covered in blood. “I did not know my little sister was dating a man who was older than her,” she said. “It was painful, seeing her lying dead in a pool of blood. She had three stab wounds on her body.” A neighbour said they heard a woman screaming, but they thought she was dancing because the music was so very loud. He said the suspect came to his house and told his son to come to his shack to see what he had done. He said his son came running and told them the girlfriend was dead. “We rushed to the suspect’s shack and we found him there. We asked him why he had killed her. Other residents came and the man was attacked,” said the neighbour. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a man (29) was arrested in connection with the death of a 15-year-old girl. The suspect was expected to appear in Umlazi Magistrates Court soon.
