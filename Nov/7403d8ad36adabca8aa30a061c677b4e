 Cape Town's new mayor Dan Plato revealed his new mayoral committee on Sunday. "It is with great pleasure that I announce today a new, united, diverse, and energised Mayoral Committee (Mayco) to serve and take the City of Cape Town and its residents forward," stated Plato who was voted in on Tuesday. They are: Deputy Mayor – Ian Neilson Assets and Facilities – James Vos Corporate Services – Sharon Cottle Finance – Marian Nieuwoudt Informal Settlements, Water & Waste Services, Energy – Xanthea Limberg Social Services, Safety & Security – JP Smith Transport and Urban Development Authority – Felicity Purchase Area East – Phindile Maxiti Area Central – Malusi Booi Area North – Grant Twigg The shake-up comes after the resignation of council chief whip Shaun August, mayoral committee members Brett Herron, Suzette Little and Siya Mamkeli, and councillors Greg Bernado and Thulani Stemela in the wake of allegations levelled against De Lille. "The members I have chosen to serve on this committee have demonstrated their ability to carry out their duties with excellence, their commitment to work together as a united council, and their passion to serve the people of this city," said Plato. He said the city's Organisational Development and Transformation Plan will be reviewed. It is likely to result in a different structure which will be taken to the next council meeting for ratification. He thanked the former Mayco members for their services and was looking forward to working with the new committee.
