RESIDENTS of Mahikeng, North West, are happy their lives will improve. Over 100 families will now be able to have their own vegetable gardens after they received green pepper, beetroot, onion, spinach and cabbage seedlings. A number of schools in the area also received seedlings, fertilizer and garden tools. The donation was part of a rural, environment and agricultural development campaign. The campaign aimed to educate pupils about food security and nutrition. Phera, Rankudu, Omega, Magokgwane and Melorane primary schools are some of the campaign’s beneficiaries. Grade 6 pupil Bokamoso Majwe (11) said: “I’m happy to have learned about the importance of planting vegetables. “We need to plant vegetables so our families can eat healthy food.’’ Molemo Molebalwa, another grade 6 pupil, said she was learnt a lot about how to keep vegetable gardens in a good condition. Rakhase Monametsi, an extension officer at the department of agricultural development, said: “The response we receive from beneficiaries keep us going.” He said the campaign was a sneak peek of what the department had in store. Monametsi said the department would host the Bokone Bophirima Agricultural Growth Show at Kgora Farmers Training Centre. It starts on Tuesday and ends on Friday. Agricultural development MEC Manketsi Tlhape said: “The department is targeting schools and households to get families and pupils to start their own vegetable gardens.”
