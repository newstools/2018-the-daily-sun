FIREFIGHTERS at the Ntuzuma Fire Station can’t take it anymore. The station in Lindelani, north of Durban, is apparently infested with stubborn pigeons. They spend half the time fighting off pigeons instead of worrying about putting out fires and saving lives. They told Daily Sun they have complained to their bosses. Now they want the municipality to intervene because their pleas have seemingly fallen on deaf ears. One of the workers said the pigeons had been bothering them for about six years. “It’s very hard to work in this place because of the pigeons. We can’t even eat our food in peace. “Some of the workers have become sick because of these pigeons, especially those who have sinusitis – they get sicker when they’re at work. “The pigeons kak all over the the place and leave their feathers,” said the worker. Another worker said: “Sometimes pigeons eat our bread. “This makes our work environment unpleasant. “We need the municipality to remove the birds urgently. “We’re tired of chasing them away every day.” The SunTeam was denied entry on Tuesday when it visited the station. When station manager Lucky Nzama was contacted for comment, he said: “This is the property of the eThekwini Municipality, so I can’t talk to the media about the building. “Since you got information from people working here, rather talk to them about this.” Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said the health and safety of municipal employees remained a priority. “The fire and emergency services management is aware of the matter concerning the birds and is working on resolving it,” he told the People’s Paper.
