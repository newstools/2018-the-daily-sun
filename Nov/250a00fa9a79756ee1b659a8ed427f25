SIPHO Mbele is tired of those he believes try to bring down Ndebele people. The 45-year-old actor, who plays Msweswe Mahlangu on SABC1’s iKani, is furious after a Facebook user and aspiring actor trashed the show. Thando Mahlangu (33) from KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, wrote that the actors couldn’t speak proper Ndebele and that the drama series wasn’t authentic. But Sipho said Thando was bitter. “I’m advocating for Ndebele, and him saying bad things reflects badly on us. I won’t allow it. “He clearly has not healed from not getting a part on the show, but this is unacceptable. “We’re all trying to put Ndebele on the map and can’t have people destroying our goals.” Thando insisted iKani actors couldn’t speak fluent Ndebele. “I’ve been pushing to put Ndebele on the map,” he said. “It’s frustrating to see people who speak other languages playing these roles. “I’m happy people got roles and unhappy at how things are.” He said he was considering getting a protection order. “Sipho has a personal vendetta against me,” he said. The actor said: “This boy grew up in front of me. I’m not going to do anything to him. “He needs to calm down and stay in his lane.”
