WHEN Evelyn Madube (52) joined MFG Funeral Scheme last September, she wanted peace of mind if someone in her family died. But when her husband Office Motsamai died, Evelyn was left with huge debts and didn’t get a cent from MFG. “They told me my husband had not completed his six months waiting period. But this is not true because I registered my husband the same day I took out the funeral cover. “They just wanted an excuse to avoid paying. The only documents I submitted late were those of my children,” said Evelyn. She claims she was treated badly by the scheme’s management. Office died on 19 October, and was buried a week later in Mokgola near Zeerust, North West, where he lived with Evelyn. Evelyn said: “Now I owe people lots of money and I’m unemployed. I was paying R110 every month to the scheme. “When I gave them the list of my beneficiaries, they said I had too many people and that I had to remove one child.” Daily Sun met Morapedi Seripe, manager of MFG in Zeerust. He said he couldn’t show us the original contract because they were kept in Joburg. He said that Evelyn should have shown Daily Sun her contract. Evelyn told the paper she only had a receipt book, and no contract. “Every person who joins our scheme fills in a form that is given as proof of the contract. She’s not showing you her contract because she knows she’s not telling the truth. “The answer we gave her wasn’t final, but we told her what we picked up from the system. We asked her to bring certain documents to lodge a claim,” said Morapedi. He said that claims were processed by their head office in Joburg. Evelyn promised to bring the required documents to lodge a claim and see what happens.
