A VIDEO of a homeless man being moered by cops surfaced on social media. The video was taken on Friday at an intersection in Randfontein, west of Joburg. In the video, two officers are seen dragging the man, beating him and kicking him as they take him to a police van. Social media users were not happy with the cops’ behaviour. Denise Morgan said: “He has been at that robot since he was a boy. He is only trying to interact with people. Everyone using that road knows him. What could he have done for somebody to call the police on him?” Nolo Maimela asked: “Are policemen even allowed to hit people like that?” However, not everyone was on the homeless man’s side. Some felt he deserved the beating as he was abusive towards them. “This boy is a problem. He intimidates motorists and swears at them. He threatens to break your window if you don’t give him money,” said Karabo Moshoeshoe. Loreen Banda said she was glad she was not the only one who had seen the man’s bad side. Police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said beating up a person was a criminal offence. “No one is above the law, not even the police. Beating up someone is assault, so a case can be opened against these officers,” said Dlamini.
