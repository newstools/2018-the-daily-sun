It’S that time of the year again when thousands of boys go to initiation school. But first they have to say their goodbyes to friends and family. Thandolwethu Tom (23) from Samora Machel in Philippi, Cape Town, will be travelling to Ngcobo in the Eastern Cape. “It’s an exciting and scary journey, but I’m looking forward to it. “I’ve been waiting for this moment. I want to get it done with.” Thandolwethu and his friends wore torn clothes that signal the end of their journey as boys. Siphelo Rasmeni (20) was happy he would finally take his rightful place in the family. “I’ve long wanted to be a part of the decision making in my family,” said Siphelo. “As a boy you’re only expected to obey elders and can’t offer an opinion. “When I become a man I’ll make my father proud and be responsible.” The Eastern Cape has the highest death rate of initiates. Solomon May (51) said people take advantage of the practice.
