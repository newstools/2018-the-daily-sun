THE biological father of a girl (2) who was raped and killed last month wants the kid’s mum to be arrested. The kid’s stepdad is being accused of her death and sexual assault. The biological father (50), from Hlabisa, said his baby mama told him their kid died of flu. “I was heartbroken when my daughter died, but I was even sadder when the post mortem revealed her mum had lied to me,” he said. The biological dad claimed investigations revealed the stepdad moered the kid to death after she wet the bed. “My baby mama also deserves to go to jail. She shouldn’t have covered up her lover’s wrongdoing.” The mum (24) admitted to lying about the cause of her daughter’s death. “I was too scared to tell him the truth. I don’t know about the rape claim, but I was there when my daughter was assaulted. “I didn’t know he would kill her,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the arrest of a 29-year-old suspect for murder and sexual assault. The accused appeared in the Hlabisa Magistrates Court on Monday and will remain in custody until Wednesday for a formal bail application.
