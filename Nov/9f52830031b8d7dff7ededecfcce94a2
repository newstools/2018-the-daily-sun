MOTHERS are supposed to love and protect their kids. But a Cape Town mother seems to be teaching her kids how
to break the law. Now Cape Town cops are looking for leads to arrest her. The unknown woman who was caught on camera in a mall
using kids to steal. Social media users are upset with the heartless woman who
uses children to steal from people in malls. This follows a video posted by Facebook user Lilian Laly
Prins on Sunday captioned: “Paarl Mall: Queen's purses should not be on the ground
and what example is the mom, for her children, sick world share and make it
viral please.” The two-minute-long video shows a woman with three
children coming out of a lift before they stand behind a woman who was at Steers
food court. The thief woman pretends to speak on the phone while
seemingly instructing the eldest of the three kids to take the handbag. The
child hesitates at first but slowly drags the purse and walks away fast while
the owner of the purse continues to work without noticing. The video has had more than 241 000 views, 11 000 shares
and over 1 000 comments the past 24-hours. “This mother is evil because what she is teaching kids
will ruin their lives forever. They may think that stealing is good yet it will
land them in jail. If it is her kids then she is a bad mother but we never
know, probably they are not hers,” commented Nolitha Tshabane on the video. Another social media user Lorraine Mzila said: “That
woman must rot in jail if she is caught, she takes away the innocence of these
young children.” Western Cape cops say the incident happened two weeks ago
and the matter is still being investigated. “The incident in the footage made available on social

Paarl Police. No other incidents pertaining to the suspects in the footage have
been reported to Paarl police before or after the incident on the 11th.
