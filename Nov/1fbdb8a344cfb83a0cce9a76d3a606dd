MAVIS Sikhosana (28) from Middelburg in Mpumalanga
was a happy woman when she went to have her baby in hospital on 23 October. But when the nurses neglected her, her joy vanished
and she apparently had to deliver her baby all by herself. Her sister Poppie (42), told Daily Sun they were
shocked when Mavis came back home with her newborn and a swollen and bruised
face. Mavis said she passed out while the nurse was
cutting the umbilical cord and when she came round, she had bruises all over
her body and face and was in pain. She said nurses at Middelburg Hospital claimed she
suffered from fits and had collapsed in the ward after giving birth. Poppie said: “We called an ambulance when my
younger sister had labour pains. It arrived and took her to the hospital. “My mother was chased out of the ward by the nurses
and told to come back later. I suspect they did not want her to see that my
sister was injured.” Poppie said now her sister looks as if she’s losing
her mind. She told us the nurses did not treat her after she
sustained injuries. Poppie told Daily Sun that the hospital staff
refused to show them her sister’s file. She claimed they were told it had disappeared and
they would look for it but until today it has not been found. Mpumalanga Department of Health spokesman Dumisani
Malamule said the department acknowledged that the patient sustained injuries. He said they would investigate how she was injured.
