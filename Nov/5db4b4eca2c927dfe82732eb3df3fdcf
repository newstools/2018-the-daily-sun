WHEN her house collapsed, she asked her neighbour if she could move in with her. The ward councillor then promised the disabled Adelaide Mthembu that another house would be built for her urgently. But that was in 2015 and the 42-year-old woman from Phase 4 in Pietermaritzburg is still living in her neighbour’s house. She told Daily Sun the long wait had caused her high blood pressure and diabetes. “Doctors said these illnesses were caused by stress. “I am worried about being a burden to my neighbour,” said Adelaide. Councillor Thami Sithole said they knew about Adelaide’s case but the problem was that she was not the only beneficiary of the house. “She told us there were only two of them who are still alive but she couldn’t give us the right documents,” said Sithole. “I have spoken to MEC for Human Settlements and Public Works Ravi Pillay to consider giving her a condonement, which will allow for the house to be built while we sort out the paperwork.” KZN Human Settlements spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi said they were not aware of the case. “There is an ongoing project in the area and we will have to ascertain whether the municipality sent her case to be attended to as an emergency,” said Baloyi. Daily Sun sent an email to Msunduzi spokeswoman Thobeka Mafumbatha on Tuesday, followed by phone calls but there was no response. She also didn’t respond to an SMS sent to her yesterday.
