CONNIE Mogapi used to start her day by opening her windows to welcome the fresh air. But now Connie (44), of Block A in Mabopane, Tshwane wakes up in a bad mood and her windows and doors are kept tightly shut. Her yard is filled with sewage from morning to night. Connie told Daily Sun she’s gatvol. After the blocked sewerage pipe spilled over in her yard a month ago, no authorities have come to help. She said: “We cannot even use our own toilet in the house because of the kak and sewage water.” “Everywhere in the yard there is kak. We are tired of the sewage always floating around my home.” She said she was tired of asking neighbours to use their toilets. The family has not been able to enjoy their food because of the smell. Connie said: “We miss the fresh air. “Our doors and windows are always closed.” Flies are all over the place and visitors are scared to drop by, fearing disease. She told the SunTeam she reported the matter to the municipality on several occasions without results. Ward 12 Councillor Molly Dlamini said: “I reported the matter to the municipality and also sent a petition about blocked sewers and maintenance to them but nothing has been done.”
