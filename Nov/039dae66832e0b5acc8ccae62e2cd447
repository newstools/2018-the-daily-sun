A 32-year-old Malawian National was hijacked during a test drive of a car he was selling. It’s alleged that the two suspects are Zimbabwean nationals. According to the victim who resides in Park Gate in KwaZulu Natal he received a call from people showing interest in his Silver E90 BMW. “The victim was then offered R87 000 for the car which was on sale for R95 000. The buyer requested that they meet at Globes Shopping Center in Ottawa and take the vehicle for a test drive before payment was made,” RUSA spokesperson Prem Balram said. Balram said upon arrival at the shopping centre, two African men got into the vehicle and the victim drove to a Sasol Garage in Phoenix. “The suspect seated in the front passenger seat then paid R100 for fuel and instructed the driver to continue driving towards Gateway - Umhlanga. The victim refused and drove towards Ottawa, the suspects asked him to pull over at a set of robots to pick up some cash from his brothers. According to the victim, two more suspects got into the vehicle and produced a firearm and instructed him to drive,” Balram said. The victim drove onto the R102 southbound lane & tried to get the attention of other motorist. The suspects then grabbed the steering and during the scuffle the victim lost control of the vehicle. The BMW swayed several times before it overturned, all four suspects then fled on foot. The suspects’ bag, laptop and a phone were recovered in the vehicle.
