SICELOKUHLE Maduna’s family is appealing to the community to assist in raising funds for his reconstructive surgery. The 20-year-old from Volkrust, Mpumalanga was burnt by a candle 20 years ago. His face and right arm were permanently damaged. Sicelokuhle, who lives with his mother and younger brother, told Daily Sun that he sometimes finds it difficult to mingle with other people because of his condition. “I am a very confident person and try not to be bothered by people’s reactions. I grew up under difficult conditions where kids would isolate me and some would cry when they saw me,” he said. He said he had been in and out of hospitals, trying to find ways to fix his face, but money was a challenge. “I have done research and the money needed is a lot. “We can’t even afford half of it, so I am appealing to the public to assist me with the reconstructive surgery which will change my life for the better.” Sicelokuhle, who is currently writing his matric, said he planned to study media studies. His mum, Tshidi Maduna (44), said she wished her son could get the necessary help. “This is important to him and the whole family. I know he sometimes doesn’t feel good because of his condition, but I believe everything will change for the better with treatment. We ask the public to help us better his life,” she said. A fundraising account has been opened for those who want to donate. For further details, people can call Daily Sun on 011 877 6060.
