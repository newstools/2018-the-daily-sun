FOR decades Nombulelo Tafeni had to crawl on the floor in order to get around inside her tiny house. But Nombulelo’s life has changed for the better. The Department of Rural Development has given the gogo a wheelchair. The Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital, the other donor, designed the wheelchair. The 65-year-old gogo lives alone in Upper Malepelepe, Tsolo. “I’m not crying today,” Nombulelo told Daily Sun. “I did a lot of that when I told people about my situation. Now I’m enjoying myself.” But businessman Dean Madala, who bought a brand new double bed for Nombulelo, said he was worried. “I think there are many people out there in Nombulelo’s situation,” he said. “By the looks of things, government doesn’t take care of people living with disabilities.” Nomkhitha Zokufa, the department’s regional deputy director, denies this. She said Nombulelo’s plight was only recently brought to their attention. She promised that the department would do everything in its power to restore the frail gogo’s dignity. Zokufa also said they would approach the Human Settlements Department and ask for a proper toilet be built for Nombulelo.
