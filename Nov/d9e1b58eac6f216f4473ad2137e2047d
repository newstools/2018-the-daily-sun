MEMBERS of Makahaza Neighbourhood Watch in Khayelitsha received new equipment in time for the festive season. The City of Cape handed over equipment such as first aid kits, hand radios, torches, bicycles and a fire extinguisher at the Desmond Tutu Hall in Khayelitsha, Cape Town on Saturday. Ward 96 councillor Danile Khatshwa told the People’s Paper: “Their presence eliminates crime in this area. Criminals must know Operation Wanya Tsotsi is back. We couldn’t just sit and watch criminals terrorise our people.” The group has 26 members, including nine women. “It’s encouraging to see that women are also taking part in making sure our communities are safe,” said Khatshwa. Joseph Majuqwana (54) said he joined the group because he knew sitting at home wouldn’t help curb crime. Thobe Kula (47) said she joined the group because she was concerned about crime in their area. “I want to be among the people who make sure our area is safe. We all know at this time of the year, crime gets worse,” she said. The group all said even though tsotsis were always busy, their activities were worse during the festive season. “We want people to feel safe at all times. We hope they will work with us to make sure they are safe at all times,” they said.
