ZWAKELE Mncwango has requested an urgent meeting with acting KZN police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi. The provincial DA leader, accompanied by MP Rishigen Viranna, was prevented from conducting an oversight inspection at the Oribi Village police garage in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday. Mncwango said the manager told him Mkhwanazi had instructed him not to let them in. They wanted to do an inspection after it was reported that over 300 police vehicles needed to be fixed. “We wanted to find out why police vehicles were not being repaired or serviced on time.” He said it was MPs’ jobs to do inspections. “For cops to do their job they need vehicles. A cop can’t conduct his job efficiently when there are no necessary resources. “We’re worried that residents are complaining about the response time of the cops, yet cars are piling up at this garage.” Police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said Mkhwanazi had an obligation to ensure cops delivered on their mandate and to put measures in place to protect cops, arrested suspects and dockets. “We therefore can’t have people walking into our police stations without prior arrangements. This also applies to those who’re mandated to conduct oversights at police stations.”
