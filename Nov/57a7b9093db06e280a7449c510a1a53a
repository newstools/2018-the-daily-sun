MAMELODI Sundowns midfielder Sibusiso Vilakazi says he is hoping for a miracle to recover from his Achilles injury before the end of the current Absa Premiership season. The 28 year-old suffered the injury back in October while he was in camp with Bafana Bafana preparing for their AFCON Qualifier at home against Seychelles. The dreaded injury was expected to keep the star out of action for the remainder of the current Premiership season, however, he revealed he might be back on the field sooner than expected. Speaking at the launch of the annual Discovery Walter Sisulu Challenge, Vilakazi, who was walking on crutches, said he was well on his way to recovery. “My recovery and rehabilitation are going well,” he said, “we are taking it day by day, the little that you do with rehab makes a difference, so day by day there is rehab that’s happening, who knows, maybe the earliest can be next month.” For now, the attacker says he will be fully behind his Sundowns teammates as they kick off their CAF Champions League campaign against Equatorial Guinea’s Leones Vegetarianos tonight. Pitso Mosimane's men have found the going tough against West African teams in the tournament but Vilakazi believes things will be different this time around. “At the moment, the only thing I can influence is my recovery, I can’t do anything about how my team does on the field. “They are a huge motivation when I’m watching them, I can’t do much in terms of me being on the field but I can only help them by trying to get myself back into the game. “I have faith in the boys, we haven’t done well against West African team but it’s an opportunity to change that. I’m sure the guys are very determined and ready to do the job.”
