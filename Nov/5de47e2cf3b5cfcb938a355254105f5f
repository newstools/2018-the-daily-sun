THERE was dancing and singing and everyone was having a great time at the tavern. But the thumping of the music was suddenly interrupted by the loud bark of guns! Moments later, patrons lay sprawled on the tavern’s floor and under tables, many groaning in pain while others screamed in fear. In the aftermath of the bloody shooting four people were wounded and one dead. Residents of Khutsong said they had now had enough of living under the terror of rival gangs. The shooting came after two gangs – the Vandals and DFK – had a fight the previous day. The Vandals apparently received information that DKF members were at Isaac’s tavern in the kasi. Then on Saturday the Vandals stormed the local tavern, shooting at everybody inside. Captain Eddie Boboko of the Khutsong cop shop told Daily Sun: “The rival gang members forced entry into the tavern and started shooting and patrons ran for cover.” He said when cops arrived at the scene they found victims lying in pools of blood, with one of them dead and others groaning in pain. The gunmen had already fled the scene. “Cluster trio task team and crime prevention members sprang into action and arrested three suspects aged between 22 and 27 years. “They were detained on charges of murder and attempted murder and were taken to Khutsong cop shop. They will appear in the local magistrates court soon.” Resident Lerato Motloung said they were growing more and more worried about the level of gang violence. “We have been experiencing this problem for a long time and we advise young people to focus on their future and not on gangs.”
