Singer and media personality, Unathi Nkayi has written a mini letter to celebrate her late friend and mentor, the iconic Brenda Fassie. On what would’ve been Ma’brr 54th birthday, Unathi took to social media to share with her fans, what the icon taught her. "Sis Brenda you would have been 54 TODAY! I miss you. I miss the lectures you’d give Lebo and I about staying humble and letting them think we’re stupid and killing them with our stage presence,” she said. She also shared that Ma’brr taught her a little something about men. “I miss you telling me about the places you NEVER wanted to see me at and the men you never wanted me to date. I miss you tribeswoman ka Mamam. I miss you fellow Scorpio,” Unathi said. The “fellow Scorpio” refers to the fact that Unathi and Brenda share a Zodiac sign, having been born between 23 October and 22 November. Ma’brr would’ve turned 54 on the 3rd of November, while Unathi turned the big 40 on the 6th of November. This is the 14th year that Unathi has celebrated her birthday without her beloved friend. Sis Brenda you would have been 54 TODAY! I miss you Madlom’ uSophitsho Ngqolomsila Yemyem. I miss the lectures you’d give Lebo and I about staying humble and letting them think we’re stupid and killing them with our stage presence. I miss you telling me about the places you NEVER wanted to see me at and the men you never wanted me to date. I miss you tribeswoman ka Mamam. I miss you fellow Scorpio! ??????
