THE Verulam Magistrates Court yesterday heard that the women allegedly killed by Sam Radebe were shot seven times each. This was revealed by Warrant Officer Gopal Naidoo during the 53-year-old’s appearance in Tongaat, eThekwini. “The doctor who examined them told me each victim had seven gunshot wounds. I fear witnesses in this case might be hurt if the accused is released on bail. One of them has received calls saying that the suspect was not done and wanted to kill their whole family,” said Naidoo. Prosecutor Winnie Mlangeni said the state wanted bail denied. “We believe if the suspect is released on bail, it will be the last day he comes to court as he no longer has work and a house. What will prevent him from fleeing the country?” she asked. A group of women protested outside court, demanding that Radebe be denied bail. Councillor Zanele Khumalo was among them. She said they wanted Radebe to rot in jail. “He is no longer welcome in Tongaat. We don’t have any place to keep animals like him here,” she said. Radebe is accused of killing his lover Nombuso Dube (33) and her mum, Thokozile (70) last month. He handed himself over to cops after the incident. Magistrate Vera Alamchand postponed the matter to Monday for a decision on whether to grant him bail.
