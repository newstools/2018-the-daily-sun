FOR the past three years, residents have waited for an agri-hub aimed at supplying fresh produce to be completed, so they can find jobs. But the people of Dr JS Moroka Municipality in Mpumalanga have been left disappointed. This is because there has been no progress on the R22 million development in Vaalbank. Resident Jacob Chillie (49) said the agriculture department must give the community answers. “There are many farmers in this area who were happy when the project started. We saw job opportunities being created but we were shocked when everything suddenly stopped,” he said. “We viewed this project as a good development but nothing has happened.” Msweswe Mtsweni (37) told the SunTeam that if the project had been completed, it would have created many jobs. “We want answers. If they can no longer use the building for its intended purpose, it must be used for another project to benefit the community.” DA rural development spokesman Bosman Grobler said MEC Vusi Shongwe had not provided any clear explanations. “We also want to know how much more money was needed to complete the hub,” he said. The rural development department said the municipality needed to comment as they were responsible for the building. Mayor Thulare Madileng said the hub had been vandalised but a contractor was appointed to fix it. He said air-conditioners and fridges were also stolen but had been replaced.
