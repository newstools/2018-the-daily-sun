THE family of Soleni Langa (34) have vowed not to bury her, or her baby, until they know what killed them. Soleni’s siblings told Daily Sun they were awaiting post mortem results. Soleni from Qhudeni died at Ekombe Hospital in Nkandla last month while giving birth. Her brother Mlatuza (42) said Soleni was admitted on 29 October. “She was fine when she left, but the following day she called and asked us to pray for her because she was in pain and nurses weren’t helping her,” he said. Mlatuza said he couldn’t get hold of Soleni the following day, so he contacted the hospital to check on her. “A worker phoned back and told me Soleni and her baby had died,” he told Daily Sun. “I spoke to the hospital CEO and she told me the baby choked on Soleni’s blood.” KZN Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo said the matter was being investigated. He said anyone found guilty of an offence would be disciplined.
