THANKS to SunPower, Connie Mogapi can now enjoy her food and fresh air. After living in a home filled with sewage for a month, she can finally relax. The People’s Paper first published an article about the 44-year-old from Mabopane Block A in Tshwane last month. At the time she complained that her pipes were blocked and kak was flowing into her yard and house. On Sunday the problem was finally solved. “I can now have visitors and enjoy fresh air and food. “There won’t be a bad smell anymore.” Connie said she was amazed at how quickly the SunTeam helped her resolve her situation. She said the municipality had failed her many times, even though she had logged a call. “I can now use my toilet and visitors will no longer think twice before coming to my house,” she said. Connie said the municipality must stop using contractors and unqualified workers. Officials, believing it was contributing to the blockages, had promised to fix a drainage pipe outside her home. They had told her that when it rained outside, soil was getting washed into the pipes and they became blocked. Her impressed neighbours said they, too, would approach Daily Sun in future, should the municipality drag its feet when asked to fix things.
