TWO families are lucky to be alive after a lorry crashed into their homes on Saturday. The Port Elizabeth families thanked God they were still alive, even though their houses were destroyed. Mnyamezele Killani (55) said he, his wife and three kids were sound asleep at their home in Ikamvelihle when they were woken up by a loud bang. When they went to investigate, they found a lorry had crashed into their home and the driver was trying to reverse and flee the scene. “I thought a bomb had exploded in my house. My daughters were crying. “I almost fainted when I saw they were covered in bricks and the roof had collapsed. “It looks like the lorry was speeding or the driver fell asleep. One side of my house collapsed and the walls were full of cracks. I’m afraid the rest of the house will collapse.” Mnyamezele said they had asked officials to build a strong wall or erect metal barriers to prevent vehicles from crashing into their homes, but nothing was done. His daughter Abongile (22) said she and her sister Oyama (6) were sleeping when the lorry crashed into their room. “I felt as if I was having a nightmare. I couldn’t believe it when I saw a huge lorry inside our house.” Abongile’s left arm was injured. Oyama sustained injuries to her head and back. Luckily, the two girls suffered minor injuries and are at home. Neighbour Lucky Monde (22) said the lorry flattened their toilet before crashing into the Killani home. “Addo Road is very close to our houses, and we don’t sleep well at night because we fear accidents. The truck just missed our bedroom,” he said. Captain Andre Beetge said: “A police report was not opened.”
