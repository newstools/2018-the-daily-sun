THE road to replace deputy president David Mabuza as Mpumalanga ANC chairman is far from over. The ANC announced it will not hold the party’s provincial general council this year, but will wait until 2019. The party’s acting provincial secretary, Lindiwe Ntshalintshali, said they will only be able to hold the council next year after the general elections. “The province failed to hold the elective conference following several postponements. This means it will only elect the replacement for David Mabuza after the national vote,” she said. The province was supposed to hold the council to fill vacant positions of chairperson, deputy chairperson and additional member, but it has been postponed four times this year. The positions became vacant when Mabuza was elected South African deputy president in December, while the provincial deputy chairperson, Violet Siwela, was elected as a National Executive Committee additional member. Last month Ntshalintshali told Daily Sun that they were almost done with branch general meetings, although Ehlanzeni region was holding them back.
