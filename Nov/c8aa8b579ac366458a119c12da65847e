Actress Phindile Gwala is set to make her TV comeback on Mzansi’s most watched soapie Uzalo. The star who made a name for herself as nosy receptionist Nonny on SABC 2 soap Muvhango, is said to be making her return to the small screens as early as 15 November, much to the delight of her fans. The Empangeni born actress left Muvhango back in 2017 after spending five years on the show. In a bid to grow her brand beyond the show, she has since appeared in the film Looking For Love alongside comedienne Celeste Ntuli, veteran actress Lillian Dube and funny man Trevor Gumbi. She also ventured into entrepreneurship, opening a shisa nyama and a car wash spot in partnership with her Congolese model husband, Armando Ngandu. The establishment, called Lotha’s Car Wash, is located in Wynberg, north of Johannesburg. Gwala will now be showcasing her acting talent for over 10 million viewers who tune into the popular SABC 1 telenovela Uzalo. According to Isolezwe, Gwala will portray the role of Diniwe, who is the twin to Khanyi Mbau’s character Lady D. Diniwe will be the antagonist to Ma Ngcobo, played by Dawn Thandeka King.
