THEY’RE a source of great pleasure and even give birth to
new life. Those are two amazing facts about punanis that most
people know. Here’s some more, to delight and amaze you: 1. When you're
turned on, your punani becomes twice as big The inside of a vagina is usually about 3 or 4 cm deep. During sex, it can expand until it is twice as deep. This is because of something called “vaginal tenting”.
The upper part of the vagina expands, which pulls the uterus upwards. This happens to help sperm move up the cervix. 2. A small
clitoris may make orgasm harder A medical study found that women with smaller clitorises
experienced difficulty reaching orgasm. This is because they have smaller clitoral glands. The smaller distance between clitoris and vagina also
makes a difference. 3. A clitoris is
like a penis, but twice as sensitive Biologically, a clitoris has the same parts as a penis: the
prepuce, the glans and the frenulum. But where a penis has 4 000 nerve endings in it, the
clitoris has 8 000. Of course, the size is different too, with the average
clitoris being about 1 cm long. 4. Not everybody
is born with a hymen Some women just don’t have that stretchy bit of tissue
just inside the opening of a punani, regardless of whether they’ve had sex or
not. Nobody’s sure of exactly what the biological function of
the hymen is, although in embryos it is thought to help keep bacteria or
unwanted bits from coming into the forming vagina. 5. A punani cleans
itself Women who think they are taking care of their vaginas
when they regularly soap inside them or rinse them with antiseptic fluids or
douches are wrong, wrong, wrong. Punanis are beautifully designed to take care of
themselves. The lining is made of various glands that release fluids to cleanse
and lubricate it. Using douches totally upsets the natural flora and pH balance
inside the punani, unleashing the risk of all kinds of infections.
