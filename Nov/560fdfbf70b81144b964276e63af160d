THE couple thought consulting a sangoma would help to keep them strong! But after the sangoma strengthened their family using muthi, the opposite happened. Rituals were done, but shocking things started to happen after some days. The family started to grow apart rather than staying together. The last straw was when the woman decided to leave her man. David Malunga (45) from Extension 14 in Soshanguve, Tshwane, said life wasn’t the same without his girlfriend, Victoria Moreku (36). He said Victoria left without giving any reason two weeks ago. He said he was struggling to get a good job before and his girlfriend suggested they consult a sangoma. “Things started going left after the sangoma came to our home,” said David. He said after Victoria left, he found a job. “I always planned to marry her after getting a job and that is exactly what I am going to do,” he said. He said he missed his children. Victoria’s brother, Matthew Moreku, said the sangoma was fake. “The person who tried to help is a family member and not a sangoma. “Victoria said she won’t go back because he had been putting her under pressure and threatening to kick her out,” he said.
