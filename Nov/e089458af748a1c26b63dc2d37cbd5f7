FORMER Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille has laid fraud
charges against senior members of the Democratic Alliance. De Lille says the charges are in relation to a defaming
forged post they distributed on social media. According to De Lille the post was claiming to be from the
Auditor General of South Africa. She says these charges of fraud were made against Mike
Waters, Bronwynne Engelbrecht, Shehana Kajee and Henk Hugo. “This issue is very clear – senior DA members have aided in
the creation and/or distribution of a forged Chapter 9 institution doc. The AGs
office has confirmed as much,” De Lille said. She appealed to the police to evaluate the evidence. “I thus appeal to the South African Police Services to
evaluate the evidence I am submitting and to thoroughly investigate and pursue
these fraud charges and take the necessary action to protect our democratic
institutions,” she said. De Lille resigned from the
position of Cape Town mayor last week, and also resigned as a member of the DA.
