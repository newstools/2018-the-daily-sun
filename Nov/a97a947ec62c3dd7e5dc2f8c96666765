SHE’s kind, sweet and she always knows what to say at the right time, so it’s no wonder radio and television beauty Zizo Tshwete has a beautiful message for her fans. It’s the almost the end of the year and people are battling with different challenges as the pressure of the festive season mounts. So, to quell the fears of those caught up in the festive season stress. The Umhlobo Wenene presenter took to her Instagram to post a lengthy video, in which she encourages fans going through some challenges to pray. “Yhu my friends, it’s getting towards the end of the year and if you feel like that punk the enemy is on your case, baby girl or baby boy do not stop praying.He sees that your breakthrough is right around the corner. The more he intensifies, the more you should intensify on your prayer. God has never let you down, He’s not going to start letting you down right now  and please understand me if the generational curses are being broken by you in your family, it means now is the time to rise, the time to stand up. Find your re-enforcements. Who are your godly counsellors, where do you find you courage, where do you find the people that are going to pray for you, the music that is going to uplift yo. What are you doing that is mediation, bearing yourself in the word of God, making sure that the promises of God come to pass,” she said
