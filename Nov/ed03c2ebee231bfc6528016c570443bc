WHEN they caught three men in possession of stolen property, they took the law into their own hands. Angry Kgautswane villagers moered the three men until they were black and blue. They didn’t stop until the suspects pointed out their accomplice. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the men, aged between 21 and 26, were accused of house robberies. The crimes apparently took place in Leboeng, outside Burgersfort in Limpopo, last month. “Instead of handing the suspects to the police, they assaulted them with various objects until they revealed who their accomplice was,” said Ngoepe. He said police were only called in after the villagers had beaten the suspects. The first three men were bust while the fourth suspect, seemingly fearing suffering a similar fate, handed himself to the police. Following the mob justice attack, villagers went on the rampage. They torched two houses belonging to a suspect’s parents and a car belonging to another suspect’s sister! “We’ve opened cases of arson, malicious damage to property and public violence against the community members,” Ngoepe told the People’s Paper. He confirmed that three suspects aged between 33 and 41 were arrested and that more arrests were expected soon. He said the suspects will appear in the local magistrates court soon. Limpopo police commissioner, General Nneke Ledwaba, said: “Community members are urged not to take the law into their hands.”
