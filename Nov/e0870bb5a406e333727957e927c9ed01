cattle and sheep farmers in Tsolo in the Eastern Cape should have been rich by now. But they’re struggling to build up their herds as stock thieves keep robbing them. But there’s hope after the Department of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform partnered with Fort Hare University to make traceable tags for livestock. The tags, which are implanted in the animals’ ears, will have the details of the stock from the day it was born and the name of its owner. Small scale farmer Zoliwe Nombewu said 15 of her cows were stolen five years ago, and last year three of her heifers were taken. “The rate of stock theft in the area is sky high. Just last week cops recovered 43 sheep.” Nombewu, who spoke to Daily Sun on Tuesday at Mdeni Village in Qumbu, and other farmers are crossing fingers things will improve now. Vumile Makaula said: “We’d be rich by now if there was no stock theft. The department has been really helpful, but government should use all avenues to fight theft.” Vuyani Somyo, the project manager at Fort Hare’s Nguni cattle development trust, said the tags would also help track diseases. The project will be piloted in 13 villages across five districts in the province, with every village receiving 100 tags. Somyo said they had spent more than R1 million on the project.
