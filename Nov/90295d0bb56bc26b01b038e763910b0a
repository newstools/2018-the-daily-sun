A thug was arrested after a shoot-out with cops. Cops spotted the stolen car after the suspects stole the car in a house
robbery. “It is alleged that at about 00:30 this morning, the 28-year-old
complainant was awakened by a noise in his lounge. On further investigation, he was confronted by three unknown
persons inside his flat in Windermere Street Humewood,” police spokesperson Colonel
Priscilla Naidu said. He was reportedly threatened
at knifepoint and ordered to lie on the floor. The suspects then took clothing and the victim’s VW Golf 7 GTI and
drove off. The suspects fired several shots at the police when the car was
spotted and the cops retaliated. Naidu said a 33-year-old suspect was wounded in his upper body and
hand. “The other two suspects abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot.
One member narrowly escaped injury when a bullet grazed his shirt,” Naidu
added. It is alleged the suspects gained entry to the ground floor flat
by going through a semi-opened balcony window. Naidu said cops are investigating a case of house robbery and
attempted murder. The suspect is expected to appear in court soon.
