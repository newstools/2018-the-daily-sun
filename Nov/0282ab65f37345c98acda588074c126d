ONE of the fun things to do at the 2018 summer edition of the Classic Car show – held on Sunday, 11 November, at Nasrec in Joburg – was to look out for cars in the two new collectable categories: Oddballs and young timers. The category of oddballs is for the cars no one would have ever guessed turning up as collectable. The other is young timer, a category for cars that appeal to classic car enthusiasts between 25 and 35 years of age. Two-door VW Golf GT The two-door Golf GThas been building serious young-timer collector status for some time. The two-door GT had many of the GTi’s trimmings, but it was fitted with a 1 600cc carburettor motor, rather than the 1 800 fuel-injected engine that powered the GTi. It was a substitute for people who could not afford a GTi. Ford Cortina Built from 1970 onwards, the collectable mark III, IV and V Cortina needs to be in excellent condition but restorations are accepted. Opel Manta This car has captivated local collectors. At last year’s show had a special display of Opel Mantas. The Manta is the Mzansi branded version of the American General Motors’ Chevrolet Camaros. Released in the early 1970s, Mantas used a 1,9 litre overhead camshaft engine. They were seen as style cars rather than hot performers. Today it’s that slinky shape that attracts the younger generation of classic car collectors. Volkswagen 411 The 411 oddball was probably the least popular VW model launched here in the early 1970s. The major reason the 411 is collectable now is because they are so extremely rare.
