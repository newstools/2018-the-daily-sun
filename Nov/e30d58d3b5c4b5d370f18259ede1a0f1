THE big shot allegedly tried to pay a R30 000 bribe to have an inmate set free! She had no idea she was walking into a trap and the court official reported her to the Hawks. Hawks spokesman Captain S’fiso Nyakane said the deputy director (39) at the premier’s office was bust last Wednesday. “The suspect appeared in the Bethlehem Magistrates Court on Monday, facing charges of fraud and corruption,” Nyakane told Daily Sun. “She was arrested by the Hawks’ serious corruption investigation unit after she allegedly approached a court official and solicited a stamped form in exchange for a bribe. “She wanted to facilitate the release of an inmate serving a 12-year sentence at Goedemoed Prison for a cash in transit offence.” Cops confiscated a vehicle, cellphone, laptop and stamp. The suspect was kept in custody and the matter was postponed to Tuesday for a bail application.
