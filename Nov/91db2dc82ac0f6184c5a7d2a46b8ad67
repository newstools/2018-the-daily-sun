SA UNDER-20 national men’s team coach, Thabo Senong, wants to use the upcoming Cosafa Youth Championships to prepare for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) tournament in Niger in February. Senong plans to use the regional competition to give his boys some much-needed game-time ahead of the big showdown in the West African country in February. Zambia will host the regional youth competition in Kitwe from 2-14 December. Senong has already started preparing his charges for this competition, with the team scheduled to leave for the Southern African country tomorrow. With limited opportunities to play competitive matches, Senong is hoping his boys will make good use of the chance to test themselves against neighbouring countries. Senong is not concerned about winning the tournament, his main focus is to gauge their readiness for the bigger test lying in wait. Amajita need to reach the semifinals of the Afcon tournament to qualify for the Fifa World Cup spectacle in Poland next year. Cosafa offers them the last opportunity to fine-tune their preparations for what Senong has described as their biggest challenge in the new year. Senong said: “For us the first objective is to qualify for the World Cup. If we come out of our group and qualify for the semis, we are in the World Cup in May. But it is important to play in the regional competition so that we can identify the things we need to work on for the tougher Afcon tournament. “The boys will use this competition to compete for places in the Afcon squad. So we will give this competition the respect it deserves.” Amajita, the defending champs, have been drawn in Group B with Namibia, Mauritius and Swaziland, while hosts Zambia are pitted in Group A against Malawi, Mozambique and Democratic Republic of Congo. Group C features Angola, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Botswana.
