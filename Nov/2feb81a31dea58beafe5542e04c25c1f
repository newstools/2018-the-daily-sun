MADALA Petrus Mokoena (62) said because of Home Affairs, he has not got his pension grant for years. The madala from Khayelitsha, Manguang said this was because officially, he was supposedly dead. He said when he reached pension age two years before, he was excited about getting his grant but was soon disappointed. “I worked for many years and it was time for me to relax. I went to the Sassa offices to apply for my grant and was shocked when they told me I was dead, although I was standing in front of them. “I visited Home Affairs and they told me they couldn’t fix the problem. I struggle because of them. I didn’t die, I’m still alive. I want them to fix this.” Home Affairs spokesman Bonakele Mayekiso advised madala to go to the Home Affairs’ Rocklands office and ask for Mbambo. “Once he has spoken to him, he must call me so I can help if there is a problem that needs my intervention,” he said.
