THE two thugs crashed into a wall last Saturday after hijacking and killing a motorist. They fled the scene on foot, but one of them was seen limping away. Residents of Swaneville in Kagiso, Mogale City, soon went on the hunt. They went from house to house looking for a limping man. They found him and his friend and handed them over to cops. The suspects allegedly confessed to killing Phaswane Griffiths and are now facing charges of murder and hijacking. Phaswane’s relative Anna Moloi wanted to know why they killed him. “I was in Welkom when I got a call to say Phaswane had been shot,” Anna told Daily Sun. “We’re deeply disturbed by Phaswane’s death. “We hope the law takes its course and his killers rot in prison. “He was a quiet and hardworking man. Many residents relied on him for plumbing.” Police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya said Phaswane had stopped at a shop to buy a cool drink when the suspects attacked him. “One suspect drew a firearm and fired a shot when the victim tried to resist,” said Sibiya. “The suspects took the car keys and sped off in his white Colt bakkie. “Police found used cartridge next to his body. “He sustained a gunshot wound to the upper body and was certified dead on the scene.” Two suspects aged 24 and 25 were due to appear in court soon.
