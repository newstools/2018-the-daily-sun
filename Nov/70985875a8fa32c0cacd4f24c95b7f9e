Volkswagen surprised the world when it lifted the lid on an exciting new concept bakkie. The carmaker unveiled the Tarok to the world at the 2018 São Paulo International Motor Show and it should go into production in a year or two. The Tarok compact double-cab will without doubt sell like hotcakes in Mzansi. According to VW, the Tarok is an all-wheel drive and much of its design is taken from the T-Cross, VW’s new compact SUV. With its striking Targa-inspired roof bar, striking front end, three-dimensional LED lighting strip in the rear, and stylish side panels, the Tarok’s design makes it the first vehicle to combine the stylistic elements of an urban SUV with an authentic off-road bakkie. Some of its new features include a large variable loading area, which can be extended thanks to the folding rear panel in the spacious four-door double cab. The loading area’s floor space can be extended by opening the tailgate or using the brand new mechanism that allows the bottom of the passenger cab rear panel to be folded down. As a result, drivers can also use the back of the cab to transport extra-long items. The interior is a futuristic showcase with a number of digital elements such as a touchscreen infotainment system, digital air conditioning controls and a digital-themed elements in the cabin space which all come together to form the main interior with all the displays and controls on a single visual and operational reach. The Tarok concept is powered by a 1,4-litre 110 kW four-cylinder TSI engine and is also combined with a six-speed automatic gearbox and permanent 4Motion all-wheel drive system.
