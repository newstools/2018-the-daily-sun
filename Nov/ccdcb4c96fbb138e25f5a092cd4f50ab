It’s okay to love your polo neck – just don’t wear it when you’re going to be in the same room as Tol Ass Mo. The comedian, whose real name is Mongezi Mahlangu, will be the MC at the Sunday Sun pool party. The event, which will include the SunBabe’s crowning, will take place tomorrow at Platinum Lounge in Cosmo City, north of Joburg. Tol Ass Mo said he wanted SunLanders to come in large numbers so they could have a good time. “When I was asked to be the host, I immediately thought of luxury. “I was excited because this is one of those offers you cannot refuse. “If you’re coming to the event don’t wear a polo neck, or else you won’t enjoy yourself. “Daily Sun is the People’s Paper and I am a people’s person, which is why it’s an honour for me to contribute my time to this event.” The comedian has just wrapped up his one-man show called Tsek Sun, It’s Personal. Tol Ass Mo told SunBuzz he was preparing to perform and be an MC at Cassper Nyovest’s Fill Up Moses Mabhida event. The judges for tomorrow’s crowning are designer Paledi Segapo, makeup artist Nikiwe Sikeyiya, designer Matome Seshoka, Sunday Sun entertainment editor Lerato Matsoso and singer Amstel.
