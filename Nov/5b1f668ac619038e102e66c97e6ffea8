QHUBEKANI Sibanda is passionate about fixing cameras. The 38-year-old technician from Jeppestown in Joburg said they all tell a story. “I have always loved photography, even though my parents couldn’t afford to send me to study after I completed matric,” he said. But the father of the three never gave up on his dream of going into photography. After matric, he got a job at a shop in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe that sold electronics, as well as cameras. “That’s where I learnt a lot about them,” he said. In 1999, Qhubekani came to Joburg to look for a job. He joined his friend Samson Ngwenya, who taught him how to repair cameras. “With my friend’s help, I managed to open my own shop where I also fix cameras,” Qhubekani said. His shop at the corner of Smal and President streets in Joburg is called Photo Sun Camera Repair. There, he fixes old cameras and also produces step-by-step videos of how to perform easy repairs and basic maintenance for all types of cameras. “I really enjoy my job because this is the field I wanted to be in. My business is doing well and has grown, because we take photos at events and print them. “Our clients are happy with the work we are doing,” he said. Qhubekani plans to also open branches in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni and in Tshwane. “I want to see my business growing, because I am creating job opportunities for my fellow Africans,” he said.
