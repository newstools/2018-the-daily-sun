BEREAVED families need to consider alternative ways to bury their loved ones. Joburg community development MMC Nonhlanhla Sifumba said there won’t be enough cemeteries in future. Apparently, Joburg City Parks and Zoo can only provide burial space for the next 50 to 60 years. Said Sifumba: “Religious leaders and funeral directors should engage with families about alternatives to help the City provide dignified burial options for loved ones. “City Parks has a responsibility to ensure that it can provide burial space.” She said there were burial options available, especially for families with existing burial locations. “These include using smaller coffins so that more room is created for additional burial space in the same location.” Sifumba said in terms of by-laws, up to three family members may use the same gravesite. But cultural expert Themba Silinda was totally against the ideas proposed by Sifumba. He told Daily Sun African men and women are buried separately because of ceremonies that need to be performed for the dead. “In the past, men were buried in the kraal and nowhere near women, even if it was your wife.” Silinda wouldn’t talk much about cremation, except to say:  “Once you burn the body, that person won’t be able to reach or be welcomed by their ancestors.” He said the soul is lost for an eternity.
