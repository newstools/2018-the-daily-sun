THERE’S corruption at our borders, and it goes to the highest level. This is the serious allegation made by DA spokesman on immigration, Jacques Julius. He said large parts of the country’s borders have no fencing. Julius, premier candidates Joe McGluwa, Jacques Smalle and Zwakele Mncwango, have finished a month-long probe into the state of our borders. At a briefing at Nkululeko House in Joburg yesterday, Julius said people were taking advantage of the lack of security at the borders. “The corruption at Home Affairs allows people to take advantage of our social services. “There are South African citizens who are struggling to get grants and yet people from outside the country are coming to get grants, buy groceries and go back to their countries.” “Our health system’s under pressure as it is and having people coming into the country illegally and adding to the strain will cause tension.” He said the DA was not calling for the borders to be blocked but for people to use the right channels. Smalle said unfenced borders also allowed animals to bring diseases. Mncwango said crime syndicates were taking advantage of the situation at the Mozambique-South Africa border by hijacking cars. Lumka Oliphant, Sassa spokeswoman, said there could be a number of reasons why foreigners get grants. She said there are foreign women with kids who are South African.
