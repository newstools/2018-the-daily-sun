Fine Fragrance Collection has come out strongly in defence of the generic perfume brands known as smell-alike fragrances. In an 11-minute documentary titled Odour, the company goes to great lengths to explain how the perfume industry operates. The documentary claims most designer fragrance brands outsource their perfume oil from the same companies as smell-alike brands. According to the documentary, most expensive fragrances cost as little as R30 to make. The huge price difference is attributed to the cost of elegant packaging, global advertising, celebrity endorsement and distribution. Simon Maritz, owner of Fine Fragrance Collection, said the documentary received a lot of backlash. “Most people think the liquid in the bottle is expensive. But it costs about R30 to buy the liquid in a 50ml bottle.”
