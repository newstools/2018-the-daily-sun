A FUN night on Saturday turned into a killing spree when a man walked into a shack in the early hours and opened fire. According to police, three people died at the scene while four were rushed to hospital. Daily Sun has since learnt that one of the four injured people who were rushed to hospital has died, while another was discharged. The incident happened in Greenville squatter camp near Alexandra, Joburg. Bandile Ntshinka (42), one of those who was hospitalised, was treated for a gunshot wound to the arm and discharged. Bandile said: “It was a fun night of drinking. “One of our friends said he was going to the shops. “When he took too long, we decided to go and look for him. “We found him being beaten by two men and we stopped the fight. “One of the men was very upset after he got slapped around.” He left but said he would come back. Bandile said it was unclear what had caused the fight, but they thought it was over and went back home. He had never seen the man before. “While we were drinking, someone pushed the door open. It was the two men again. “Without saying a word, one of them started shooting. We scrambled for cover and hid but sadly not all of us could.” According to a neighbour, the suspect recently moved to Greenville and was known to the community. Police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said police were investigating cases of murder and attempted murder. “Three people died at the scene. Two of the dead are brothers,” said Dlamini. The suspects were still on the run.
