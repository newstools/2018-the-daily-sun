ACCORDING to Dr Malinga, you don’t choose where you do the idibala dance. A video of the musician performing the dance is doing the rounds. “We do it anywhere, even when we are driving. “You don’t make an appointment,” he said. The dance move was made popular by King Monada’s single titled Malwedhe. As the song about fainting plays in the background, Dr Malinga can be seen with a packet of tablets in his hand. He acts as if he’s taking them to cure his fainting problem. The Road Traffic Management Corporation warned motorists against busting the move while behind the wheel. “We are calling on motorists not to copy such behaviour because it is a serious threat to road safety.” King Monada said: “I didn’t do a video showing people how to idibala.” There are videos of people from different parts of the world doing the dance. King Monada said when he recorded the song, he didn’t think it would be an international hit. The musician said those who don’t understand the song’s lyrics must just enjoy the music.
