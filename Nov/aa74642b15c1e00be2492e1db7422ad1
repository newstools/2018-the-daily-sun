FOLLOWING his secretive trip to Russia, deputy president
David Mabuza says the costs for the trip came out of his own pocket. Mabuza reportedly went to Russia for a routine medical check
from the doctors who treated him when he was poisoned and fell ill. He off work for about three months, three years ago after he
allegedly fell ill after eating something a kids party. His spokesperson in 2016, they were unable to give more
details on the nature of the poison used. At the time the deputy president said there were specific
people he believed were behind his ordeal. "To characterise his routine medical check-up as
secretive and drawn-out is just clutching at straws," his spokesperson
Thami Ngwenya. Ngwenya told News24 that the deputy president went to Russia
for a routine medical check from the doctors who treated him when he was ill. â€œThis has nothing to do with trusting or not trusting South
African doctors."
