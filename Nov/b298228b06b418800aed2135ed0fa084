WHAT was meant to be an armed robbery ended up as a disaster when police caught the suspects red-handed on Monday. With their hands full of cellphones and other accessories from the cellphone store, they stumbled on armed police who welcomed them with tough hands. A street vendor (52), who saw the movie-like action unfolding at the MTN store in Pixley kaSeme Street, Durban, said they were minding their own business when they suddenly saw three armed men holding employees hostage. “They did not use force when they entered the store, but were like customers who wanted to enquire about cellphones. But when they got inside, they pulled out firearms and started ordering all the employees to lie on the floor,” said the street vendor. She said while two of the robbers made sure employees were not doing anything to raise the alarm, the third one told one of them to open the cellphone lockers and they started looting. Another street vendor (32) said the robbery went wrong when they tried to flee in their getaway car. “The police happened to be driving in the same road and noticed the thugs. They blocked them and that is how they were arrested.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident. “An unlicensed firearm, cash, and a motor vehicle key were found on the suspects. The suspects, who are aged between 24 and 26 years, are due to appear in the Durban Magistrates Court soon. “They will face charges of armed robbery and illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition,” said Zwane Public relations specialist at MTN, Mthokozisi Ndlovu, said: “We are currently organising counselling for all our employees who were in the shop when the suspects stormed in.”
