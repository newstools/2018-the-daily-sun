FANS were sad when Duma Mnqobi left Generations – The Legacy. He then started promoting his music on social media. But it looks as if the actor, who played Bafana Cele on the SABC1 soapie, has failed to impress music fans with his singing talent. Duma’s song Umsindo is trending on social media, but for the wrong reasons. He set social media abuzz after he posted the video of his song on Monday and Tuesday. The video was met with laughter and disappointment. Social media users have questioned if Duma could really sing. It seems Twitter, Instagram and Facebook users shared the same views about Duma’s music style. Some even advised him to focus on acting and leave music alone. Others made jokes by linking his singing with the storyline, in which he was shot dead. Okuhleskenjana said about Duma’s Instagram post: “So you died on Generations. I cried my lungs out only to find out you’re literally chasing a singing career. Stop already boss, wow sana, you are singing kak.” Sibnene said: “Babang’ umsindo. No dude, he must stop.” On Twitter, LethaboLT1 said: “Call Jack Mabaso to come save his son from himself or the Russian mafia will.” But there were a few fans who said they loved the song. Tafadzwa_rusere01 wrote on Instagram: “I’ve been waiting for this. I love the song. Thanks.” When Daily Sun contacted Duma, he said he didn’t want to talk to newspapers and magazines unless he got paid for it.
