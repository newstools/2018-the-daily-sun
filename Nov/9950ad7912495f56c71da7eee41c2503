TWO young mums are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their newborns. Their babies died at Shongwe Hospital in Mpumalanga on Tuesday when the hospital reportedly ran out of oxygen. Prudence Mokoena (21), who gave birth to a baby girl on Sunday, told Daily Sun the problem started on Monday, but they had been assured that everything would be fixed. She said a nurse whose name tag said “Mahlalela” called her to check on her baby, as she was crying. “When I got there I noticed that something was not right. The nurse then came in and shouted at me. “She asked why I had touched the machine, but I could not answer because I did not know what to say,” Prudence said. She told The People’s Paper that a few minutes later she was called by the nurses, who explained that the oxygen had run out again but her baby was fine. “They called me again and told me the oxygen had totally run out. I am hurt and nothing will ever make sense to me,” she said. Another mother, Nthabiseng Malika (20), who also lost her baby girl, said she wanted the hospital to explain what had happened. “I was never told what happened,” she said. “Instead I was called to the office, where they told me I would be provided with counselling.” Mpumalanga Health MEC Sasekani Manzini confirmed yesterday morning that three babies died on Tuesday. She said a task team would investigate the causes of death. “We are here to check what happened. We do not want to speculate. We have established a task team that will investigate and we are expecting a report by Friday. “We ask members of the public to stay calm.”
