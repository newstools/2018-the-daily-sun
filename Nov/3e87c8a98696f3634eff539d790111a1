AN image of Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital’s casualty ward following the weekend’s chaos has left social media reeling in shock. The image posted on Twitter shows patients lying in beds while the floor in the casualty ward is a mess. Many tweeted that the department of health should take action and keep the hospital clean. But the hospital based in Soweto explained to the uninformed that the image was in fact taken while or just after doctors had fought to save patients who were sick or injured during the busy derby weekend. Responding to Daily Sun’s media inquiry, hospital spokesman Zenzo Ndabula confirmed the image was taken at the hospital. “The picture was taken at the hospital’s trauma unit during or immediately after resuscitation. “As usual, the unit was cleaned immediately after resuscitation. Resuscitations happen all day and all night and it’s a continuous process of saving lives and cleaning.” But scores of Twitter users raised their frustrations, calling the hospital a death store.
