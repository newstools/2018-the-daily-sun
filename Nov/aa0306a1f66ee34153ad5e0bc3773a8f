IF IT does not get an injection of funds the SABC will not be able to operate beyond March next year. This was the simple message delivered by SABC board chairman Bongumusa Makhathini. “We are basically insolvent. When we project our future income, if we do not get a financial injection the SABC will collapse by March,” he said. “Around January there is not much revenue from advertising, so we project Day Zero to be in March 2019.” He said the broadcaster would collect about R300 million in March, but it needed R600 million a month to meet its monthly obligations. The SABC is sitting on a debt of R1,3 billion. “We should be spending about 50% of our revenue on content, but the bulk of the revenue goes towards the salary bill,” Makhathini said. Last year the SABC requested a guarantee from the government so that it could borrow money from the banks. “We have not been given the government guarantee letter; all we have been given is a borrowing limit letter of R1,2 billion,” said Makhathini. EFF MP Ntombovuyo Mente said it would not look good if the SABC were to collapse. “I do not know if there is an intention to have the SABC collapse, but something has to be done,” said Mente.
