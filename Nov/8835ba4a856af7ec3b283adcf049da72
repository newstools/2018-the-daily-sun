Naturally, the couple kisses after being announced
husband and wife on their wedding day. But the wife in this case refused to kiss the husband. The video of a wife refusing to kiss a groom at their
wedding has gone viral on social media. The video was posted on the Facebook page of Mwebantu, Zambiaâ€™s
News website. In the video, the priest is seen telling the recently
married couple to kiss but the wife repeatedly refuses when the husband tries
to kiss her. Facebook commentators said the marriage was not going to
last while others said the man must have cheated on the wife the night before
the marriage. Others suggested this was a forced marriage. Other commentators even suggested the husband might have forgotten to brush his teeth.
