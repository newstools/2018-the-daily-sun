IN this church, women have to write their names and contact details in a register. The book is then given to a pastor, who allegedly chooses which woman he wants. Now angry husbands are up in arms and they have accused the pastor of sleeping with their wives. They want the church in Ennerdale near Lenasia, south of Joburg, to be closed. Some of the husbands have gone as far as banning their wives from the church. “He sleeps with our wives and expects us to like it. “I forbade my wife from going to that church because it promotes evil,” said one of the angry husbands. “We want this man to apologise. “He has money and he uses it to attract our wives.” They claimed the pastor was violent and sometimes threatened to hurt them. “Some pastors are just anti-God. Churches like this need to be shut down,” he said. Daily Sun visited the church, but it was closed. Neighbours said most of the people who go to the church are women. “We do not know if this was done on purpose,” said a resident. The People’s Paper spoke to the pastor and he admitted to dating inside his church. “There was a woman I dated, but her husband told me to leave her alone so I stepped aside,” he said. “I have since closed the church because I want to avoid fights and threats. “I do not want to fight in front of children.” He said his church did not have a name. The pastor said women wrote their names and contact details so he could collect data about the people who had joined his church.
