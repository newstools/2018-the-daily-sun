FREE State Stars are desperate to sign a new striker during the January transfer window hoping to solve their scoring problem. This was revealed by their head coach, Luc Eymael. Ea Lla Koto are creating many chances but apparently just cannot score. “Yes, I will be looking for striker who can finish and score goals for us,” said Eymael. “We are creating 12 to 17 chances but we can’t even score.” Stars parted ways with their star striker Siphelele Mthembu who was in a good space last season, and the gap left by the former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates player still needs to be filled. Mthembu, who is now playing for Cape Town City FC, won the MTN8 trophy last month and played a huge role in helping Stars winning the Nedbank Cup last season. To make things worse, Ea Lla Koto have suffered a huge blow to their striking force ahead of their coming Absa Premiership encounter against defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns next Wednesday at Loftus Versfeld Stadium (7:30pm). Stars striker Eleazar Rodgers will miss the Brazilians clash due to suspension and that would be a worry for the Belgian coach as he is already in need of a finisher. It remains to be seen who Eymael will partner with Judas Moseamedi up front against Pitso Mosimane’s lads. He is likely to let Moseamedi run with Harris Tchilimbou or with the 22-year-old Linda Bhengu. The former Polokwane City FC coach added that he knew this season would be more difficult for his side than last. “We had a good season and we won the Nedbank Cup. Teams are now coming strong when playing us this time,” said Eymael, who was once linked with a head coach position at Chiefs this season. “I knew it will be difficult to repeat what we did last season. “But we will keep fighting and we will add one or two players when the transfer window opens.” Eymael said.
