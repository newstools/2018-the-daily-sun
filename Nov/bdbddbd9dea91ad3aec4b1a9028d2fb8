It's not every day you get to experience and drive the AMG GLA,
CLA, C63s, E63 biturbo and GT S in one day. The Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit was the perfect place for the
Cell Experience. We were given the exclusive pleasure of driving on the
world-renowned Grand Prix Circuit with a fleet of Mercedes Benz AMG high
performance vehicles, with the help of the AMG Driving Academy instructors - we got to experience
what Mercedes-AMG’s are really of. The SunWheels team got the opportunity to hone and develop their driving skills on both the track and the skidpan. The day began with driving on the skidpan which resembles the
Gymkhana grid, with a truck – which I must say was nothing I was expecting. Following that, we got to the fun part of the day – driving the
Aufrecht
Melcher Grossaspach (AMG) high performance cars. The best part is that
we also drove the Mercedes-AMG GT S, which is a beast of a German machine – but
the performance of the GLA on the track was rather implacable in the way it
delivers power and handles on the road. Given the chance to choose between GLA, CLA and A45 – I’d
take the GLA any given day, well with exception to the C63s of course. Towards the end of the day, the instructors threw us into
the deep end with the X-Class range to test its off-road capabilities. I must say it passed
with flying colours – until I was told descend downhill. That one of my scariest experiences I’ve ever had, and the
instructor just said to me: “Go down, hold the brake where you are comfortable –
if something goes wrong it will brake for you.” The little voice in my head meanwhile, was saying “VERY
ASSURING” but then again I survived, I’m here writing the article – all thanks to
the capable X-Class.
