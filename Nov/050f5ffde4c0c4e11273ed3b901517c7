EACH and every player in the Banyana Banyana team have played a role in ensuring the team reach the semifinals of the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations. After an exhilarating performance in the group stages, Desiree Ellis’ charges are now fired up for the final, but first they must negotiate their way past Mali in a semi-final clash scheduled for the Cape Coast Stadium on Tuesday evening (8:30pm SA time). Thembi Kgatlana, who is tournament goal scorer with four goals after three games, says their encounter against Mali will be a completely different ball game compared to their last performance against Zambia where they drew 1-1 to qualify for semifinals.Kgatlana’s performance in this tournament has improved 100-fold compared to 2016 where she failed to ignite.  The 22-year-old has urged her teammates to remain grounded and declares war ahead of their blockbuster against Mali. “We haven’t achieved anything yet, so we can’t start celebrating,” said Kgatlana. “The three games we have played have taken a toll considering the traveling and heat weather.  But our next game against Mali we will die on the field if we have to. We know what is at stake.” “Team work is what will help us win the match. We have put behind all the past results now we are mainly focused on this one game that can change our lives.” Senior  players such as Captain Janine van Wyk , Noko Matlou, Nompumelelo Nyandeni and Mamello Makhabane have also vowed that this year they have to take Mzansi to the Fifa Women’s World Cup which is the only global stage they have never played in as they have been into two Olympic Games in 2012 and 2016 in Brazil. But now the players will need to work as a team more than ever to ensure they are among the top three teams which will qualify for next years Fifa Women’s World Cup in France. This is for the seventh time in a row Banyana reach the semi finals of the tournament since 2004 and now they “have to go one more step” coach Desiree Ellis have said.
