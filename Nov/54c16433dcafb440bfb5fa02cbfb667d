NINETEEN years ago, she failed matric, and now she’s back to take care of unfinished business! Vuyelwa Tutumi (41) from Asanda Village in Strand, near Cape Town told Daily Sun she now knows that losing her job was a blessing in disguise as she’s got another chance to finish her matric. She also hopes to graduate from a tertiary institution, but writing matric is the first step. “I always wanted to study psychology, but after I failed matric, I had to find a job,” said Vuyelwa. After she lost her job this year, she decided she wouldn’t look for more work. “I bought a house and built flats in the yard to get money while I focus on my studies. “Adjusting back to the life of a student was very challenging. I had to get used to catching a train early in the morning to get to school.” Vuyelwa doesn’t see herself as a particularly bright student. “But I work hard to get good results. The only support I have is myself and I want this. I want to see myself graduate. That is my motivation,” she said. She advises others to use their past victories as motivation to go back to school. “We all have achievements in life, no matter how small they are. Use that as motivation to keep you going. It is very difficult to go back to school when you are old. “There are so many doubts that come to mind, but you have to fight those thoughts,” said Vuyelwa, who is one of the oldest people writing matric this year.
