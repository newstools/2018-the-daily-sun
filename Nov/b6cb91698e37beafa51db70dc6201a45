Orlando Pirates captain Happy Jele has stressed the importance of having their supporters fully behind them when they kick off their CAF Champions League campaign on Wednesday. The Bucs skipper says the team feeds off the noise from the stands and he is hoping that there will be plenty of it come kick off. Pirates make their return to the tournament after a three year absence when they take on Light Stars from Seychelles at the Orlando Stadium (7:30pm). “I cannot stress enough the importance of the supporters,” Jele told his club’s official website, “the role they play as the 12th man in the stands is the fuel that keeps us going during the match. We have been blessed to play in packed venues of late with this weekend’s semi-final being the pinnacle. For us as players, to see them at the stadium, see them in the stands and to feel the positive energy is priceless and we thank them for that. “When we play against Light Stars on Wednesday it will be the start of a long and difficult journey. Personally speaking, I was there when we reached the 2013 Final, I remember how close we came and how much we wanted to clinch the Champions League trophy especially for our supporters. Now that we have been given another chance it is key that we start things off on the right foot and build the momentum from there”, added Jele. “From just looking at our next four fixtures we have a tough task ahead of us and as such it is key that we have our supporters there to help us pull through and it all starts on Wednesday.”
