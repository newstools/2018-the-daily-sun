MAYOR Solly Msimanga walked the streets of Tshwane on Wednesday as part of a cleaning-up operation. Together with the MMC for community safety, Derek Kissundooth, Msimanga went to Marabastad in the CBD to monitor those who break the laws. Msimanga said they had been confronted with a number of by-law infringements. “This has pushed us to do these operations. They will remain a regular occurrence around the city. These operations will also be used to save the city from decay,” he said. They visited abandoned buildings and crime hot spots. Msimanga said some of the successes from this operation included the confiscation of 13 bags of illegal goods worth about R700 000, the recovery of 26 municipal dustbins, and five notices issued to people trading without certificates of acceptability. “I’m pleased with our hard- working officials for their tireless work,” he said. “This programme should be supported as it forms part of the renewal strategy to achieve the Liveable City Objective.” Msimanga thanked businesses and residents who uphold by-laws every day.
