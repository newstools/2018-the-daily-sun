Local rapper and business man Cassper Nyovest has just made a bold move. That's because Abuthi'Fill up and well known record label Universal music announced their new partnership. The rapper and his company Family Tree will now be under Universal music. Cassper says, "We signed up with Universal because we decided it was time to grow, we have done enough as an independent label and we want to reach a new level." He also mentions that he still owns 100% of his company, his publishing rights and his music. The question on everyone's lips is "What is Universal gaining from this partnership, if Cassper still owns everything?" Cassper is set to release a new album this December called Sweet & Short.
