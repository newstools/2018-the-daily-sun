Domestic worker Nonhlanhla Mthiyane requested leave on 9 November due to an urgent traditional gathering at home. She hoped her boss would understand but things turned ugly when she not only lost her job but her clothes as well. Nonhlanhla (25), from Obuka Village in Empangeni, northern KZN, claimed her boss Sanelisiwe Mchunu of Farewell Crescent in Empangeni burnt all her clothes last Sunday. “I want her to pay for all my clothes. I asked to go home because my parents said it was important that everyone should be present.” Nonhlanhla said she asked to be released on short notice but had promised that she would come back the day after the gathering. But her employer was allegedly still not satisfied “She fired me via SMS and then burnt my clothes. The SMS read: ‘Don’t come back to my house, I don’t need you anymore’,” said Nonhlanhla. “I don’t know what the big fuss was about because I made sure I left her without any house work to worry about and I was going to be back the following day,” said Nonhlanhla. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of malicious damage to property was opened at Empangeni cop shop. Ex-boss Sanelisiwe said: “I had agreed to pay back her clothes and I thought we had forgiven one another for what happened, including that she left my small kids unattended. But because she’s chosen to report the matter to the police, I’ll wait for the court to make a ruling on this matter.” Daily Sun went back to Nonhlanhla and she said: “Yes, she apologised but she refused to pay me R10 000 for my clothes.”
