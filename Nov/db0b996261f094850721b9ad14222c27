COPS are in hot water after a suspect apparently got hold of a firearm while in the police cells and shot other inmates! The shocking incident happened at Isipingo Police Station in Durban on Saturday. The suspect was allegedly trying to escape when he opened fire on other prisoners, killing one and injuring four others. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident but said the matter had been taken over by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate. Ipid spokesman, Moses Dlamini, said they suspected the cops on duty were negligent because it was not clear how the suspect managed to enter the police cells with a firearm. He said it appeared that the police didn’t search the suspect properly and members who were on duty would have to explain to Ipid how the incident happened. Dlamini said one inmate was shot dead during the incident and four others had to be rushed to hospital. He said the suspect was shot and wounded by a police officer and was taken to hospital. He was charged with murder, attempted murder and escaping from lawful custody. “We are investigating allegations that the suspect was taken to the police cells without being searched. During the process, two other inmates managed to escape,” he said. “The shooter is in a stable condition in hospital and will appear in court soon after he has recovered. “We will call all the officers who were on duty and their commanders to explain how this happened.”
