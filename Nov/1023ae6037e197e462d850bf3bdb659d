THESE parents are working hard to make sure pupils at Vulumzi High School pass matric. They cook for 74 pupils who are camping at the school in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth. They want the kids to study in peace. Xolile Bonakele, a local businessman and member of the Bay Taverners Association, donated food to the kids on Sunday. He told Daily Sun: “I started helping last week when I brought pupils cooked meat. “I don’t want the kids to miss home on Sunday afternoon. I want them to think of their studies so they can pass the exams.” Pupil Lusanda Mateisi (18) said the camp had really helped them to focus. “The camp has given us a chance to concentrate. It has moved us away from the disturbing kasi life,” said Lusanda. “Since we started attending the camp in September, many pupils work has improved. “We appreciate the support we get from our parents.” Parent Zoliswa Mbambo (54) said they started cooking for the pupils early in the morning and left at about 6pm. “We make sure the kids don’t starve because we want them to pass their exams,” she said. Principal Mzimkhulu Fina said it was motivating to see so many people supporting the school. “We noticed that some pupils struggle to prepare for their final exams at home. “They have problems such as too much noise, shortage of space, poverty, living in shacks and not having water or electricity. We’re proud of the community support. I hope positive results will come from this.”
