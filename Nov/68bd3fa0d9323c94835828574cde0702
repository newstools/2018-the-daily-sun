JAPAN Ndlovu (68) is an honest citizen who wants everything done by the book. But his son Tshepang (26) likes to take short cuts. So when Japan found out that Tshepang was making illegal electricity connections, all hell broke loose! Japan told his son to disconnect the illegal power, but Tshepang got aggressive. The madala then hit Tshepang with a brick to defend himself, and his son responded by breaking all his windows. Japan from Bekkersdal, west of Joburg, called the cops and his son was arrested. Then he kicked his son’s girlfriend out of the house when she refused to cook on a paraffin stove. “I stay on the straight and narrow road,” said Japan. “Many people have died because of izinyoka and I do not want to be one of them. “My son likes to take short cuts, but they are dangerous. “He bridged my electricity meter and that made me angry. “He also broke my windows. Where am I going to get the money to fix them?” Tshepang told Daily Sun: “I broke my father’s windows after he hit me with a brick. “He thinks he is the centre of the universe. I am not going to let my wife cook with a primus stove. “A lot of residents are using izinyoka power. “We have no electricity most of the time because other people made illegal connections to a transformer,” said Tshepang. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Linkie Lefakane said Tshepang was arrested for malicious damage to property. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said connecting residential power lines to transformers was illegal. He said the power utility would continue to educate people about the importance of using electricity safely.
