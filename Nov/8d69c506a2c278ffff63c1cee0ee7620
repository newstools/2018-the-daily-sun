THE greedy thugs thought people were asleep when they drove their taxi into the school premises and started breaking in. But residents in Mamelodi West, Tshwane woke up and called cops. While the thugs helped themselves to food, stationery and more, the cops pounced. Three suspects fled on foot but one carrying a big bag of mealie-meal was arrested. Dibuseng Seoko (40) said a neighbour woke her on Sunday morning, saying there was a burglary taking place at Agnes Chidi Primary School. “We called the police, while silently going house to house and waking residents.” Agnes said they were scared they would be in danger if they confronted the thugs. “We didn’t know if they were armed or not. “We were happy when the police responded after five minutes of us calling them. They came in time and stopped the party.” Captain Johannes Maheso said the suspects got in by breaking the school’s burglar bars and locks with a hammer and crowbar. He said they didn’t get away with anything as the cops responded quickly. “We thank residents around the school for working with us and protecting the school.” Maheso said a Quantum with two different registration numbers was found at the scene. “We are investigating a business burglary. “The arrested suspect will appear in Mamelodi Magistrates Court soon. We urge people to help us punish the suspects that fled.”
