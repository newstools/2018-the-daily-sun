FOR the first time this season, the Springboks will run out with an unchanged lineup. This is after Boks coach Rassie Erasmus decided to retain the team which edged Scotland 26-20 last week, for their final outgoing tour Test with Wales at Principality Stadium in Cardiff tomorrow (7.20pm). Several players, including Handre Pollard, S’bu Nkosi, Pieter-Steph du Toit and Embrose Papier, played their hearts out in Edinburgh. The Boks are keen to end the tour a positive note, not least after they had a promising season under Erasmus, which included a series win against England and epic victory over the All Blacks. “Wales have a formidable squad and their current run of eight unbeaten Tests is proof and also an indication of their good form at the moment,” said Erasmus. “As I’ve said before, we know Saturday’s Test is going to be our most difficult match of the tour.” Erasmus has gone for the same loose trio of Duane Vermeulen at no 8, flankers Pieter-Steph du Toit and Siya Kolisi, Franco Mostert and RG Snyman being the lock combination while Frans Malherbe, Malcolm Marx and Steven Kitshoff will pack down in the front row. Jesse Kriel will partner Damian de Allende at centre, the former playing in his 40th Test match for the Springboks, while Pollard and Papier are the halfbacks. The Boks have picked themselves pretty quickly and nicely following the early setback against England in their opening tour match, flummoxing France and Scotland. A win tomorrow will just be the cherry on top. However, Erasmus is not anticipating a walkover for the Boks. Added the coach: “Wales defeated us in Washington in June and have now won the last three games against us. “They are a well-balanced and strong side with a great home record, so our boys will be in for a massive contest on Saturday. “We will be desperate to win, and to end the tour on a high would be fantastic for the experience and growth of this squad.”
