WHEN maskandi fans heard Vusi Nova and Mthandeni “Igcokamelisha” Manqele were recording a remix of Asiphelelanga, they were very happy. But they were left disappointed when it turned out that the two had recorded a new song, which was not what they were expecting. Fans have now compared the two to Jonah in the Bible, who went to Tarshish when God had instructed him to go to Nineveh. Vusi had said he was planning on remixing the song as maskandi fans had complained the original, which paid tribute to dead artists, had sidelined musicians such as Mtshengiseni Gcwensa, Mgqumeni Khumalo and Bhekumuzi Luthuli. When fans heard the new song titled Wena Ukhalelani, many were furious and took to social media to complain about it. Many said that Vusi and Mthandeni had fooled them. Lastborn-Makhanya commented on Mthandeni’s Instagram: It’s a nice song but hey, you did like Jonah who was sent to Nineveh but went to Tarshish. Bayanda Xaba said: You make a fool of us, where is our song? Vusi said: “We’re the artists and when artists are together in studio, something comes up.I understand we went to the studio to remix Asiphelelanga, but Wena Ukhalelani came up and we decided to record it.” He said it was sad that some maskandi fans were bossing them around and didn’t want to wait. Mthandeni said:  maskandi fans must expect fireworks when the Asiphelelanga remix comes out. “We are doing exactly what we went to studio for. “We will never disappoint our fans.”
