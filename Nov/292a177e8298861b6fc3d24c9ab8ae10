Kaizer Chiefs yesterday released an
initial list of 24-players that will do the job for their African Confederation
Cup. Amakhosi will tomorrow mark their return
to the second division continental club competition when they host Zanzibar’s
Zimamoto at Port Elizabeth’s Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Wednesday at 7.30pm. The club has elected not to fill all the
spots as more players can still be registered at a later stage of the CAF
Confederation Cup. The game between Chiefs and Zimamoto at
Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Wednesday will kick-off at 19:30. The second leg will take
place in Zanzibar on Wednesday, 5 December.  THE
