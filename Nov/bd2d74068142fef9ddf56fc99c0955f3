ELSIE Thebeyagae was left devastated after her brother disappeared on 29 October. The 47-year-old said the situation was made worse after her relatives started blaming her. Ever since George Molemi (50) went missing from Ikageng in Potchefstroom, North West, she had gone around the kasi with a photo of him, asking residents if they knew him. She said she had advised him to move from the family home in Mahikeng to her house. She believed he had a better chance of finding work there after struggling in Mahikeng. Elsie, who lives in Odinburg in Tshwane, said her brother was not mentally disturbed and would have asked for help if he was lost. She realised he was missing at the end of last month. “I went to visit him and the house was locked,” she said. “It was a Wednesday and neighbours said they had not seen him since Monday.” She suspected something bad happened to George. “He’s not a violent person or a womaniser,” she said. “I went to all the taverns in Ikageng and nobody had seen him. I went to look for him at all the hospitals and clinics, without any success. Maybe he was attacked. “I struggle to sleep and I blame myself. Some of my relatives also blame me.” Elsie said SunReaders were her last hope. “He’s slim and speaks Tswana,” she said. “He doesn’t know Ikageng well, and if anyone spots him please report to the police. “He likes reading Daily Sun and I’m pleading for him to come back.” North West police spokeswoman Captain Adele Myburg said cops were investigating a missing persons case. It was opened at the Klipgat Police Station. Anyone who knows George’s whereabouts is urged to contact Daily Sun’s Tshwane offices on 012 485 9251, or Klipgat cops on 012 707 8900.
