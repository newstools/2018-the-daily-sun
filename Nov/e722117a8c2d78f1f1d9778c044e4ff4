THE Dee Foundation aims to improve the lives of kids, women and the elderly. The foundation was founded last year by Jabulile Digashu (23) from Middelburg in Mpumalanga. “I started the foundation because I’m striving to fix problems in and around our community.” The foundation supports projects that help people become self-reliant. “We’re passionate about changing lives. It’s the driving force of the foundation,” she said. “We believe no man is an island and together we can achieve far more than what a single person can.” The foundation was founded on compassion to touch and uplift as many lives as possible. Each year during the month of July, they have a Mandela Month initiative. This year, over 150 blankets were collected and donated to people around Middelburg. “These blankets were given to underprivileged kids and young women in the community of Avalon in Mhluzi, Middelburg,” she said. The foundation also hosts an annual birthday celebration and fun day in December. They also have an initiative called Nkapese. “The sad reality is many young girls and boys only fantasise about their matric dance and never get to go as not all of them are able to afford it. So we decided to name our project Nkapese – a Sotho word meaning clothe me,” said Jabulile.
