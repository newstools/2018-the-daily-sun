JULIUS Malema has called on communities in Limpopo not to be divided by tribalism. The EFF leader was speaking at the party’s manifesto consultation in Polokwane, Limpopo on Saturday. He also listened to the concerns of residents in mining towns. Malema said Limpopo people were undermined because there was no unity. “The outsiders do as they wish because you like peace. It’s time for you to stand up,” he said. “Our artist King Monada released the track Kea Idibala but because it was done by someone from Limpopo, people look down on it. We are Limpopo people, who must unite and defeat the tribalism demon.” Malema said Rustenburg was being developed because people were united. “They have the same platinum you have in Mokopane but there’s no development here because you are not united to fight against these mines.” Malema told people to beware of leaders who turned their backs on them after being bribed by management. He assured residents his party would not arrest zama zamas but would send them to school to be taught how to mine so the surface soil was not ruined. Edward Pasha of Sekhukhune Small Scale Miners said they tried to mine on their own land after getting permission from then King Kenneth Sekhukhune but security guards shot at them with rubber bullets and took away their equipment. He said they believed Malema could be their last hope.
