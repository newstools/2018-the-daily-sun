ACTRESS Zikhona Sodlaka woke up on the right side of the bed and is definitely feeling herself as she travels to different African countries. The actress shared a snap of herself on a Tuk Tuk and having a bite of a fruit. The star, who is currently making waves on Mzansi Magic’s riveting drama series Housekeepers, said she is happy with her life as it is. This is what  she had to say: “I am aware more and more of the privilege of liking the life I have been blessed (by God) to live....and that it does not come with all the answers to all the problems I have in life but that I get to handle them better and I'm okay with that. I am okay with the person I am and am becoming wethu. Kumnandi ukuzithanda. Kumnadi uthanda abantu abano thando”  I am aware more and more of the privilege of liking the life I have been blessed (by God) to live....and that it does not come with all the answers to all the problems I have in life but that I get to handle them better and I'm okay with that.
