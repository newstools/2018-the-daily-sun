ONE of the families that had to postpone the funeral of their loved ones because of a go-slow at the government mortuary in Pietermaritzburg finally buried their son on Saturday. The funeral of Kwanda Msomi (3) was postponed three times because workers at Fort Napier Mortuary had downed tools. The go-slow two weeks ago had forced Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo to personally perform two post mortems on Tuesday. The People’s Paper published the story on Thursday. Dhlomo had criticised the mortuary employees’ action. He said they had compromised burial arrangements for several families. He promised the families he’d ensure the 26 outstanding post mortems would be done by Friday. Kwanda’s mum Nomusa (27) was relieved that she could finally bury her son. “Kwanda died on 1 November and his body was taken to Fort Napier Mortuary for a post mortem. “The post mortem was scheduled to take place on 5 November but never happened. “We had planned to bury Kwanda on 8 November but couldn’t because of the go-slow. “The funeral was postponed three times.” She said she was relieved when they were told the body was ready for burial. “Now we’ll have some peace knowing that our child was finally buried.”
