‘LIVE among those you love, do what you like … this is
true happiness,” wrote Surat Paeowgate on his Facebook page. According to Coconuts, Surat is a farmer who lives in the
central Thai province of Chai Nat with his family and water buffalo. Water buffalos are traditionally treated as beasts of
burden and used to plow rice fields in Thailand, but Surat has shown they can
be your soul mates too. His selfies with his beloved buffalo have gone viral,
with almost 30 000 shares in just a few days.
