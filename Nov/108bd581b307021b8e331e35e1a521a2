RICHARD Alexanda is an angry madala. The 73-year-old from Dark City in Mangaung wants his Sassa card back. He told Daily Sun his cousin Themba Siphamla (53) took the card two years ago. Themba apparently promised the madala he’d buy food for him and pay his funeral policy. He hasn’t returned Richard’s card. Richard admitted that Themba used to withdraw money on his behalf. “I’m old and Themba is my only relative. I gave him my card and ID to help me buy food. “When I last saw him he gave me R50. He promised to bring me food but didn’t. I’m forced to search for food at a dumpsite. I don’t know why he’s doing this to me. I want my card back.” A neighbour said: “Madala Richard has been suffering since his cousin took his Sassa card and ID. “He’s forced to beg residents for food. Sometimes he searches for food at the dumpsite” But Themba told the People’s Paper: “My cousin lives with a disability and I visit him almost every day. “I often give him R300 and buy food and clothes for him. But he sells his clothes and food. “I won’t give him the card. When he dies I’ll have to make sure he gets a decent burial.” Social development spokesman Simon Khonco said he will send social workers to assess Richard’s situation. Sassa spokeswoman Sandy Godlwana said: “Richard should go to the police station and Home Affairs to get an affidavit and an ID copy. We’ll then help him apply for another card.”
