WHEN Naome Rasebeshela (45) received her RDP in 1997, she thought the one-roomed structure would eventually be extended. But 21 years later, Naome from Aluta Park near Mokopane, Limpopo, is still waiting for that to happen – in vain. Naome said she bathed during the day, when her kids were at school, as she had no privacy. She moved to the area after giving birth to her second child. “When I moved here, everybody thought the government planned to extend the houses but that didn’t happen,” she told Daily Sun. “I squeezed in two small beds to accommodate three of my adult sons while the young ones, including my disabled daughter, sleep on the floor.” Neighbour Mary Motloutsi said she had written a letter to the Mogalakwena Municipality, asking its officials to intervene. “But no one came,” Mary told the People’s Paper. “The Red Cross donated food parcels and clothes. “But Naome needs this house to be extended because her child is living with a disability. Human settlements spokesman Paena Galane said there were no plans to extend the houses. “The houses were built 21 years ago, and some of the adults in the family qualify for their own individual houses,” he said.
