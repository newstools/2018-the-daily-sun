HIS reawakening began with just the hint of a smile. And then the miracle happened! After 12 long years in a
coma thanks to a horror car smash, Wang Shubao (48) finally opened his eyes and
looked at his devoted mum. According to Beijing News, mum Caring Wei Mingying (75)
has looked after him day and night through all the long years, hoping that one
day the nightmare would come to an end and her son be restored to her. A poor widow, Caring would wake up at 5am each day in
their small house in China to bath, feed and massage her son so he didn’t get
bedsores. She had been doing this since 2006 when Wang had his
massive accident. Caring has totally bankrupted herself looking after her
son while he lay in a coma, sinking into nearly R330 000 debt. Sometimes she was so poor she stopped eating for as long
as a month and her weight fell to just 28kg. She told the Beijing News: “There was a time when I
wouldn’t eat for an entire month because we were so poor. “My mouth, my tongue was all dry. I would just drink
water.” Then finally in October her dedication and sacrifice was
rewarded when Wang finally opened his eyes and saw his mum watching him, tears
falling down her face. He still can’t move or speak, but Caring continues to
hope for the best. “I am just
overjoyed. I hope he will make a full recovery. I will never give up on him. I
hope he can call me mum again one day,” she said.
