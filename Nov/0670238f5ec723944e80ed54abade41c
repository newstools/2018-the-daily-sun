Local hunk, Maps Maponyane has shown some love to his mom with an appreciation post on social media. And with that, we finally have proof that all of Maps’ good looks come from his mom. Maps’ mom, Sylvia Maponyane is the only one in Maps’ immediate family who hasn’t been in the spotlight as much as Maps and his father, Marks have. But she is so beautiful, she deserves all the attention and judging by Maps’ Twitter post, she knows it too. MAPS FEELS HURT AND LET DOWN! “My mother just sent me this to remind me she's ‘all kinds of beautiful!’,” said Maps. Of course as we all know, Sylvia has had to rise above some trying times over the past years. She and Maps’ father, legendary soccer player, Marks Maponyane called it quits in 2017 following claims of domestic violence and alleged pornographic images. Sylvia not only told the court that Marks had abused her through-out their 22-year marriage, she also claimed to have found naked images of several women belonging to Marks. MARKS MAPONYANE FOUND GUILTY OF ASSAULT! The National Prosecuting Authority eventually found the retired footballer guilty of assaulting his wife. During the whole ordeal, Maps' only public statement was "It hurts the most when the people you really love and have always looked up to, let you down".
