HUNDREDS of Cosatu members marched to the office of Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha yesterday. They demanded that people involved in the VBS Bank scandal should be punished. The march started at SABC Park. It was led by national deputy general secretary Solly Phetoe and provincial leaders Gerald Thwala and Calvin Tshamano. Tshamano said: “We’ve noted that those who are speaking out against VBS are targeted. The provincial secretary of the South African Municipal Workers Union was shot and hurt at his home. “We’re saying whistleblowers must be protected. Even if we are not protected, we’ll continue speaking against these looters.” Thwala said it was unlawful for municipalities to invest with mutual banks. “The police and the Hawks have a constitutional responsibility to investigate and arrest these thieves who staged a daylight robbery against the defenceless,” he said. Limpopo deputy police commissioner Major-General Jan Scheepers said they had received the memorandum. “I can assure you if the community and police hold hands, we can stop crime. It doesn’t matter what kind of crime. The process of investigation in this matter is ongoing.”
