THE hall at Dikeledi Makapan Primary School in Makapanstad, North West was full of mourners yesterday attending Shelton Karuweruwe’s memorial service. The seven-year-old was allegedly stabbed to death in the school bathroom last Wednesday morning by a grade 11 boy from another school. His father, Leroy Karuweruwe, said he is very angry over what happened to his son. “I would like to thank everyone for their support,” he said. “What happened was a great shock.” Principal Willy Modise said he had never seen such a shocking incident in his life. “I caught the perpetrator in the toilet, but the law forces me to call him a suspect.” Modise said Shelton was one of the most clever pupils at the school. “This term he achieved 100% in maths, 95% in English and 88% in life sciences.” Sadtu representative Amos Diale said religious education should be brought back as a subject. “It played a positive role in our lives and we must agree, it would mould our children in the right direction.” Speakers described Shelton as humble and brilliant. The family said they will be travelling to Zimbabwe with his body on Friday. “We will probably be burying him on Sunday,” they said.
