NONTEMBISO’s ID is taking too long. She’s afraid that her life will remain on hold because of the delay. She applied for her ID in February this year but is still waiting for it until today. Nontembiso Mbengo (18) from Ramaphosa in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun: “I thought Home Affairs was better than it was years ago but I have been waiting for my ID for eight months with no luck.” Nontembiso, who is currently in matric at Etwatwa High School in Wattville, said her future was on hold because of the D crisis. “I need to apply at varsities and colleges. I want to apply for funding as well but this document is delaying my plans. “I need this ID. Not only does it affect my studies, it will also affect me if I decide look for a part-time job,” she said. She added that the bursaries she had hoped to apply for were already closed and that she was running out of time. “I will end up applying for things I don’t like because of the delay in getting my ID. Please help me,” she said. Her dad, Mandla Mbengo (47), shares his daughter’s concerns. He said they had been going up and down trying to push Home Affairs to issue his daughter with her identity document. “I am really worried about my daughter. This is messing with her future plans. Please help her,” said Mandla. He said the issue had made his child’s life stressful. “She’s always in her room and sometimes thinks of giving up,” he said. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the matter had been referred to the relevant unit to begin an investigation.
