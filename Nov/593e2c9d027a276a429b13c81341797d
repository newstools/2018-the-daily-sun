The
South African Revenue Service has once again embarked on a nationwide awareness
campaign to remind taxpayers of their obligation to submit outstanding tax
returns. The
three-week campaign, which kicks off today, is targeted primarily at
businesses, to encourage compliance regarding Corporate Income Tax (CIT),
Value-Added Tax (VAT) and Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE). Information
on taxpayer obligations, the submission of tax returns, and consequences
related to non-submission will also be shared during the campaign. SARS
will also issue final-demand letters to affected taxpayers. SARS
spokesman Sandile Memela explained that although Tax Season closed on October
31, those who missed the deadline are still expected to file all outstanding
tax returns, and administrative penalties may be imposed for failure to file. Provisional
taxpayers have until 31 January 2019 to file their tax returns via eFiling. Memela
said taxpayers who do not submit their returns will be charged an
administrative penalty, which can range from R250 to R16 000 per month,
depending on the taxable income of the taxpayer
