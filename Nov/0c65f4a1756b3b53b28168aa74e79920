LAST month, the People’s Paper ran the story of Modiehi Olifant trying to get her money back from Pastor Jerry Seshauke. In the article published on 25 October, the pastor from the Charis Missionary Church in Botshabelo, Free State promised Modiehi (33) from Ipopeng kasi in Mangaung he would give back her money by 1 November. Modiehi deposited R30 700 into the pastor’s personal bank account for a church trip to Nigeria that never happened, but still hasn’t received her cash. The pastor told her it is because of the newspaper story that he broke his promise. In a recorded phone conversation with Modiehi, he said: “After the story in the newspaper, things got out of hand. “Other people supposed to go to Nigeria have picked up on the story and said they were no longer interested and wanted refunds.” He said he can no longer focus only Modiehi’s problem. “To be honest with you, there will be a delay. I have been suspended from the church with immediate effect and have been blocked as Charis pastor. “ I have done wrong and got suspended.” Modiehi said: “The pastor blames me for taking the matter to the media. “This proves he is nothing but a liar.” Two other victims said they were fighting the pastor through their lawyers to get their money back as well. “I’m fighting for a refund of R30 000,” said one victim from Welkom. Pastor Dathney Phophi from Charis Church in Gauteng told Daily Sun he knew about Pastor Jerry. “It’s not the first time that he allegedly did this. He isn’t picking up his phone. We don’t work in such a manner. He is now suspended.” About the Nigerian trip, Phophi said: “I don’t know anything about that trip.”
