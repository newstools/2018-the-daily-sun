KWANELE Mdluli regrets trusting the man who fled with her bakkie after he asked to take a private call in her car. The 27-year-old woman from College View in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga told Daily Sun she didn’t dream anything like that would happen as the man was introduced to her by people she has known for a long time. Kwanele said she was busy with deliveries on Sunday when her friends arrived with a man known as Sibuyi Mabaso. He asked for her car keys so that he could answer a phone call in private. She said she didn’t suspect anything and handed him the keys. “A few minutes later he drove off while talking on his cellphone and never returned. He has not answered any of my calls since he disappeared. I regret trusting him.” Hazyview police spokeswoman Constable Dudu Malibe said a case of theft of a motor vehicle was opened. She asked anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspect to contact the investigating officer, Detective-Sergeant Amony Mashangu on 079 735 5940 or 013 737 8284.
