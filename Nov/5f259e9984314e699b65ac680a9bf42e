ANC deputy chairman Bulelesi Ntshangase, in the Inkosi Bhambatha area of Nquthu, is not happy with a councillor who also works at a local school as a security guard. The Ward 3 councillor, Mbhekiseni Mkh-wanazi, is also employed as a guard at the Klwana Combined School. Ntshangase claims that Mkhwanazi’s work as a guard is suffering because he is also a councillor. He said this was proved last month when a pupil at the school was stabbed dead in the school’s yard by another kid. Mkhwanazi was away on councillor duties at the time of the incident. “It would have made a difference had he been at the school when the fight broke out. “I believe he would have seen earlier that the kids were fighting,” said Ntshangase. Councillor Mkhwanazi said: “Ntshangase is a teacher at another school in Nquthu. “I do not know why he is interfering in the affairs of my ward. That pupil was not killed, and the incident happened after school.” Ntshangase said being a teacher was different from being a guard. “The pupil was killed. The principal told us he fell in front of him in the school yard and they rushed him to the clinic, where he was declared dead.” Sihle Mlotshwa, a spokesman for the KZN Education Department, said: “We are not aware of the matter, but we have since asked the district to give us a full report, because we would not want anything to disturb the peace at our schools.”
