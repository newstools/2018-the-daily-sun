TWO heavily armed thugs are behind bars thanks to brave cops. This is after police in Kestell, Free State, acted on information from a car tracking company tracking a stolen red Hyundai Elantra driven by heavily armed suspects. The cops jumped into action and soon spotted the Elantra barrelling down the R57 at about 7.30am on Wednesday. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sinah Mpakane said police tried to stop the suspects’ car, that was driving at high speed, but the suspects raced off. “One cop pointed a firearm at them and their car swerved and hit the police car. Another member fired shots at the suspect’s car, which forced it to come to a stop and both suspects were arrested on the scene. One member sustained injuries to his left shoulder. He was admitted to hospital but was later released,” Mpakane said. She said the suspects had allegedly robbed a person in Vereeniging, in the Vaal. The two suspects, aged 30 and 32, face charges of attempted murder, possession of a suspected stolen vehicle and driving without a valid driver’s licence. They were linked to other cases in Bethlehem and Sharpeville. They will appear in court today.
