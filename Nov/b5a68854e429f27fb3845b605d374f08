PREPARATIONS are in full swing for a prayer day that will be held at the deadly stretch of road on the N1 south between Modimolle and Kranskop tollgate in Limpopo on Sunday. The prayer is to cleanse the road because more than 40 people have lost their lives in accidents over the past two months. It will be led by Limpopo Premier Stanley Mathabatha and Minister of Transport Blade Nzimande. Transport and Community Safety MEC Makoma Makhurupetje said all interested parties, including pastors, would join the cleansing ceremony. “We took the decision to partner with national government and faith-based organisations to pray for an end to road accidents and fatalities. “We really hope that praying for this road and other roads will release divine power to stop the ongoing series of carnage,” said the MEC. Makhurupetje pleaded with motorists to obey the rules of the road and avoid reckless driving. “The cleansing ceremony will be worth nothing if drivers don’t stop misbehaving on our roads.” Following the prayer, the minister and premier will launch the Festive Season Road Safety Campaign, which coincides with the annual Roads Safety Summit and United Nations World Day of Remembrance for victims of road crashes.
