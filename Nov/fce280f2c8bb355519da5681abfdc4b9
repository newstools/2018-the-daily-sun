WHEN a driver parked behind another vehicle on Saturday, the car guard asked him to move. However, the guard paid for his act of goodwill . . . The motorist allegedly drove off but then returned to the scene. He hit the car guard on the neck with a glove full of metal. Vusi Mgixwa (25) from Duduza, who worked as car guard in Springs, Ekurhuleni, died in hospital of his injuries later that day. Now Vusi’s angry customers, who are mostly white, want the white man who killed him to pay. Marie van Zyl told Daily Sun: “That boy was good to us and has been working as a guard since he was at school.” Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said the suspect appeared in Springs Magistrates Court, charged with murder.
