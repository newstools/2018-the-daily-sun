A 25-year-old man was arrested for attempting to steal groceries worth R12 000 in Verulam KwaZulu Natal. A man from Ndwedwe claims that he was approached by an unknown man, who requested assistance in packing stock. He had allegedly paid for at a wholesaler. The unknown man reportedly promised to pay him for his help. “The suspect went on to explain that he and the foreign national entered the business and loaded a trolley with 43 cases of Lucky Star tin fish and 8 cases of Colgate toothpaste.” “The same items appeared on the receipt which was then handed to him. The foreign national then left the store after telling the suspect to meet him outside with the goods,” Reaction Unit South Africa spokesperson Prem Balram said. As the suspect passed the cashier he produced the receipt for the items on his trolley. The cashier suspected something was out of the ordinary and requested security in the store to investigate further. Balram said after inspecting the invoice, the security personnel recognised that the proof of payment was fake. CCTV footage from the store shows both men entering the business together and shortly after loading the trolley one of them exiting the business there after. The man was then arrested and handed over to the police.
