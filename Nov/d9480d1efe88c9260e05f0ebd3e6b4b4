THE 10TH instalment of the Feather Awards took place last night at the city hall in the Johannesburg CBD and the flamboyant founder of the awards Thami Kotlolo had a humorous interview with President Cyril Ramaphosa about matters of the LGBTIQ community. In an Instagram video posted by one of Thami’s best friends singer Kelly khumalo, he can be heard asking the president if he has any gay friends to which the president responds: “Well, I have quite a few. Yes, I do”. The Interview was aired at the awards ceremony yesterday. Sneak preview of my interview with President Cyril Ramaphosa...I had fun chatting to him ?? will post more soon. ??
