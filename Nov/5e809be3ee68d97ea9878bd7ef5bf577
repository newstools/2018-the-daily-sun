VIOLET Mathebula says the secret to a long life is respecting the elders and avoiding booze. The gogo celebrated her 100th birthday at Majembeni Village in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Saturday. She’s one of a few that had the honour to celebrate their 100th birthday at almost the same time as Albertina Sisulu and Nelson Mandela. Violet might be old but she’s still active. She was blessed with 11 children, but nine died. She is only left with two of her youngest daughters, 30 grandchildren, 34 great grandchildren and seven great-great-grandchildren. Best friend Ella Seganye (99) said Violet was strong, full of life and never let anything put her down, even after she lost her kids. “Since we were young Violet was the only one who showed us the right way: never to drink alcohol and sleep around. She encouraged us to put God first. I saw the happy life she was living. She was never a disgrace to her children and grandchildren and was a role model to all of us.” Her 25-year-old great grandchild, Fortunate Sithole, said what kept her great- grandmother healthy for so long was her good heart and being active. “She preferred doing things herself until she was declared blind recently,” Fortunate told Daily Sun. Gogo would always warn them to stay away from drugs and boys. “She said this would help us find good husbands and live longer. I’m now happily married to a good husband because I listened to her sound advice and lived by it. “I thank God for blessings this family with this bright shining star. The journey continues and I wish you more and more years to come gogo.”
