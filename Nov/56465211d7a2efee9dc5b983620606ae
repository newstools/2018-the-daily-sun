EASTERN Cape Health MEC Helen Sauls-August visited Uitenhage taxi rank yesterday. She wanted to discourage taxi drivers from sleeping with schoolgirls. Sauls-August was accompanied by acting Aids Council chairwoman Pumza Dyantyi. They were launching the province’s treatment and testing campaign at Uitenhage City Hall as part of the buildup towards World Aids Day on 1 December. The programme is aimed at reducing new Aids infections and to welcome back patients who have defaulted on treatment. The MEC also distributed condoms at the taxi rank, encouraging people to practise safe sex. She said: “Health workers will visit homes to test people for HIV, diabetes and high blood pressure. We also encourage women to be tested for breast cancer and men to come in their numbers to test for prostate cancer. “We are confident we will reach our target of an Aids-free society by 2030.” Dyantyi said, “I urge parents to take care of their daughters. “Talk to them to avoid blessers. Don’t accept groceries from your daughters’ sugar daddies. Old men must stop luring girls with money. My being poor doesn’t mean you should take advantage of my daughter.” Uitenhage Taxi Association chairman Siyanda Mbanjwa said: “Parents should ensure children arrive at school. “Kids should not play at taxi ranks. They end up being tempted by taxi drivers and get pregnant or infected with disease.” The MEC said: “Nelson Mandela Metro was identified to host activities based on its poor levels of health screening, testing and treatment services and the high rate of patients stopping treatment, as well as the high drug-resistant TB rate. “The campaign will help to trace 43 831 of patients who have stopped treatment across the province. “Nelson Mandela Metro accounts for 8 912 of these,” Sauls-August said.
