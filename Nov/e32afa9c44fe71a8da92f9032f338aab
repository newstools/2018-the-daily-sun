PITSO Mosimane is considering midfielder Tiyani Mabunda as Mamelodi Sundowns’ next captain in light of his leadership qualities. South Africa’s golden coach said “Shuga”, as Mabunda is known in local football circles, has a bright future in Chloorkop and “will one day lead Sundowns on a permanent basis”. His qualities came to the test this past weekend in Limpopo when they lost 2-0 to Baroka FC in the Telkom Knockout. In the absence of captain Hlompho Kekana, the 30-year-old was given the armband and led from the front, despite the unfavourable outcome. “If you ask me if Tiyani can be a captain for Sundowns in the future, the answer is a big YES,” said the 54-year-old Mosimane. “He is a hard-working player and disciplined on and off the field. He has a bright future with us. He takes care of himself very well.” The Polokwane-born star joined Downs in 2013 from Black Leopards but was loaned to Free State Stars. He came back to Downs after a season and became one of Mosimane’s ever hard-working players. He has lifted many pieces of silverware since returning to Downs, including two PSL trophies and the biggest club cup on the continent, the African Champions League trophy. His form over the past three seasons has seen him deservedly win the heart of Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter, the player getting a call-in the must-win Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Nigeria at FNB Stadium on 17 November.
