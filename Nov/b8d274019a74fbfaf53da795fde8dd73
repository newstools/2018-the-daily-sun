HE was a ladies’ man and used to charm women with his dance moves. But those dance moves cost the 25-year-old from Dipotomaneng kasi, Clocolan his life. Tseko Piet was allegedly dancing the vosho naked for a married woman when her husband suddenly came home unannounced. He pulled out a knife and stabbed Tseko dead while the woman watched in shock. His madala, Buti Mokobotoane (68), said he was saddened by his grandson’s death. “I was home when Tseko told me he was going to see a friend. I even joked that he was going to see a woman, but he laughed it off and told me no. “Hours later, residents came to tell me something had happened to him and I should come with them,” said the madala. He said when he arrived at the scene, Tseko’s body was lying in a pool of blood. “The woman he was killed for came to me and told me she was sorry. I was told Tseko was caught naked by the woman’s husband dancing the vosho while she cheered him on,” he said. The madala said a neighbour where Tseko was killed told him the husband came back from work in the early hours of the morning on weekends and the woman thought they would not get caught. “But it seems the man came back home early and, as a result, my grandson was stabbed seven times and died on the spot. “I don’t know how I’m going to bury him because I’m a pensioner and he was unemployed,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said: “A 45-year-old man was arrested and charged with murder.”
