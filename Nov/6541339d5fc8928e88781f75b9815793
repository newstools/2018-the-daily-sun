The ANC and its alliance partners will march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Friday. Tasneem Motara, ANC Provincial Spokesperson said the ANC Gauteng Province together with the Alliance partners COSATU, SACP and SANCO, civic society organisations and members of the public will tomorrow lead a march to the highest office in the land. Motara said the aim of the “People’s March” is to find sustainable solutions to various concerns such as poor state of the public transport system, regular fuel hikes, value added tax (VAT) increases, cost of data, and e-Toll. These, she said, have a bearing on the daily cost of living experiences of the masses of “our” people, especially the poor.
