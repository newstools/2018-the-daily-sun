A CROWD gathered in the scorching sun as police dug around in the sangoma’s yard. They peeped over each other’s shoulders as they huddled underneath umbrellas to get some shade, curious to know despite the scorching sun. But in an instant their prying eyes were filled with horror. Emerging from the dry, dusty earth, cops found the remains of dead babies! The gruesome find was made in Phumula near Leondale in Ekurhuleni yesterday. According to the police, the suspect, a woman aged 43 who is a sangoma but is not registered in the area, was helping another woman to perform illegal abortions. Ekurhuleni West cluster spokesman Captain Andre de Jager said they received information from the community and officers were sent to the house. “The unit from the victim identification centre of the police was at the scene after information was gathered that foetal remains had been buried inside the sangoma’s property. “The remains were recovered and will be sent for forensic analysis,” he said. De Jager said the suspect was arrested and detained at Alberton cop shop. She will be charged with concealment of birth. “The suspect will appear in the Palm Ridge magistrate court soon,” he said. Sangoma Dungamanzi was shocked to hear of the incident. He told the People’s Paper: “Under no circumstances are sangomas allowed to perform abortions. Women who need to have an abortion should always be referred to hospitals.”
