A WOMAN who was left crippled after falling off a cliff
fleeing a would-be rapist has proven her courage by finishing a marathon. According to New York Post, Hannah Gavios (25) nearly
lost her life in 2016. A native of New York, America, she was on holiday in Thailand
when she was attacked by a would-be rapist. She managed to escape her attacker,
but fell about 46 meters over a cliff in the darkness. The fall left her with a fractured spine, confined to a wheelchair. But Hannah has the never-say-die spirit of her home city,
New York. She joined in with the thousands of runners who took part
in the New York City Marathon last Sunday. It took Hannah 11 hours to complete the 26,2 miles
(almost 42 kms), but she did it with plenty of supporters urging her on to the
finish line. It was 8pm by the time she reached it. “I didn’t expect this many people,” Hannah said
afterwards, shaking and crying with exhaustion. “It just shows my city has my
back. My city is awesome, waiting for me here — I don’t know how long everyone
waited for me — it just means so much to me that you guys stayed. Thank you.” Hannah had previously told New York Post that she was
driven to take part in the marathon because “I’m going to be a functioning
human — I don’t want to feel like I’m left behind”.
