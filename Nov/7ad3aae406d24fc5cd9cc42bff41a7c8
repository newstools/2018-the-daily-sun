RESIDENTS of Tsakane in Ekurhuleni are tired of walking through puddles of sewage. They said kak from a local sewerage line had been flowing into their yards since last year. Candry Padi (43), a resident, said his complaints fell on deaf ears. “We don’t know who to turn to now. “Our lives are at stake,” he said. Candry said he was tired of inhaling smelly fumes. Pieter Mkhondo (33) said he feared his gogo would trip and fall in a puddle of kak. “My gogo is very old. Whenever she wants to go outside, a relative accompanies her because we don’t want her to step in a puddle of sewage,” he said. Elizabeth Makhanya (43) said it was impossible to ignore the huge river of kak in her yard. “This waste and excess water creates a lot of health hazards such as mould. “We need help,” said Elizabeth. Candry said residents once went to the mayor’s office but didn’t receive any assistance. “We sent several emails and photos that illustrate the extent of the problem, but we’re not getting help. “At one point I sent an email and the municipality said I’m attracting ‘unnecessary attention,’” said Candry. Municipal spokesman, Themba Gadebe said the problem would be fixed as soon as possible. He encouraged people who had similar problems to call the municipality so they could receive a reference number. “We will try and fix the problem. “If people lose their reference numbers, we will track it by using their address,” said Gadebe.
