SOCIETY needs to respect people who are living with disabilities. This was the message at the disability awareness workshop at Tsomo Town Hall last week. It was organised by the Eastern Cape Disability Economic Empowerment Trust and the provincial education department. It was attended by residents of the Chris Hani and Joe Gqabi districts. Provincial education special programme acting director Sheila Mtirara said: “The workshop focused on educating participants on the abilities and competence of people with disabilities while assisting to understand how to remove barriers. People who live with disabilities are not accommodated. But our government is busy trying to rectify those mistakes.” She said it wasn’t right that some schools discriminated against pupils who had disabilities. “In our communities we don’t have special places where we keep disabled people. We live with them. So why do we isolate them when it comes to schools?” The trust’s CEO Thabiso Petukayo said: “We say don’t bring disabled people to the party but disabled people must be in the party. “The ultimate goal of the workshop is to make sure people are not treated differently when government provides services,” he said. Anga Folokhwe (28) from Joe Slove township in Cofimvaba, who lives with albinism, said: “I learnt a lot in this workshop because now I can see our rights are not undermined. “As a person who’s living with albinism, I was told I’m not supposed to queue when it’s extremely hot because the sun will affect my skin. “I must go to the front when I need help and not stand in the queue.”
