WHAT is it about sex that attracts our attention? Someone has to just say or write the word sex and we’re hooked. This is why Durex Global and RED, the global non-profit organisation, visited shopping centres and educated people about safe sex and gave away free condoms. The money raised by the roadshow will empower schoolgirls as part of the Keeping Girls in School Programme. The programme is aimed at reducing HIV infections and pregnancies in girls and young women. It is also aimed at improving their access to sexual and reproductive health services and providing sex education in schools – all to encourage girls to stay in school and finish their education. The partnership is funded by a R70 million donation to the Global Fund. Added to this are proceeds from the sale of specially-branded (DUREX)RED condom packs sold in South Africa at Clicks, Dischem, Pick n Pay, Engen, Sasol and Total until 31 December. The campaign’s RED bus visits Gauteng communities, promotes condom use, provides sex education and distributes more than 150 000 free condoms. “Gauteng holds about a quarter of South Africa’s population and 17,6% live with HIV/Aids,” said Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng, board member and Africa representative on the Durex global advisory for sexual health and wellbeing.
