However, concerned fans and friends will be pleased to learn the star is "Awake" and safe in hospital. The Ice Cream hit-maker took to social media this morning to assure her fans she was okay. "Awake - It wasn't time huh," she captioned a picture of her hand that had a strong message written on the palm. The message on Gigi's palm read: "Depression don't win." Gigi, whose real name is Genesis Gabriella Tina Manney, has previously opened up about her struggles with depression. All this comes at a time when depression and suicide are a huge talking point in Mzansi following the death of iconic Motswako rapper HHP, who allegedly took his own life after his own battle with depression. Gigi has received a lot of support from fans who are not ready to lose another talent after bidding farewell to stars such as HHP, Prokid and Mandoza to name a few this year alone.
