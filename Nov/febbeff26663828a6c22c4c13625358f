THREE points and pride at stake would be the order of the weekend in the Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC) derby festival at Vosloorus Stadium. Football fanatics will be treated to a feast of four Derby matches as KwaZulu-Natal, Tshwane, Polokwane, Free State and Soweto rivals will clash for the first time this season. Tomorrow AmaZulu face the defending champions Golden Arrows in the first match of the day (10am), 2016 champions Mamelodi Sundowns entertain SuperSport United (12pm). The big one of course will be on Sunday where Kaizer Chiefs Reserves will be up against Orlando Pirates Reserve side in a Soweto Derby. This one could also set for the tone for next weekend’s Telkom Knockout semifinal match between Chiefs and Pirates which will be played at the iconic Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday (3pm). After humiliating Chippa United 10-0 a fortnight ago, Chiefs couldn’t maintain as they fell off to Bidvest Wits 2-1 last weekend. Amakhosi reserves mentor Arthur Zwane says he now ‘demand’ results from his inconsistent players. Zwane’s charges are sitting in position 10 on the log with nine points after seven games. “We lost to Wits (last week) maybe it was a wake-up call. The players need to prove us wrong win the title, but I think it’s gone,” said Zwane. “As a coach you reach a point where you say I’m developing, I want to develop winners not players. Now we playing to win. I demand results now. I told them we had a three-year plan and now we at the stage where we should be winning consistently. If I don’t see that then I’m worried. They need to prove us wrong.” The former Amakhosi player suspects that his players will show up this weekend. “Maybe they will be fired up against Pirates (this Sunday) but I don’t like players who are choosing games. They do not need any motivation for this game,” he added.
