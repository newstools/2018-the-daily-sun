This year’s edition will feature 13 top-ranked South African DJs to usher in the New Year.

Revelers have been promised an “audiovisual spectacular of epic proportions” at the world-class arena which boasts an international, award winning digital audio system for spectacular sound and acoustics, as well as a high definition, audio-visual system. “In 2017, we were bowled over by the response to the inaugural NYE Block Party, with us welcoming a capacity crowd for the 15 hour long party. It’s only right that we bring it back. We’re just going to make it bigger and more awesome than the first time,” said Time Square General Manager, Brett Hoppé. The festivities will commence at 18:00 on Monday, 31 December 2018 and continue until 06:00 on 1 January 2019. Time Square has also offered revelers the safety-first option of various “Show and Stay” Packages, giving you the option to stay at the luxurious Maslow Time Square right in the same complex. These packages are available from www.computicket.co.za, as well as simple show tickets which range from R399.
