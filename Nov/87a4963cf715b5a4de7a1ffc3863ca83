MARITZBURG United development goalkeeper Constandino Christodino has jetted off to England for a two weeks trial with English Premier League champions Manchester City. The news was confirmed by the club on their website that the 16-year-old goalkeeper, who plays for the Team of Choice’s Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC) side and also captains the SAUnder-17, will spend two weeks on trial in England. He flew out to Manchester over the weekend and started his trial period on Monday. Maritzburg's general manager Quinton Jettoo said Christodino has been eyed by the Premier League giants for a long time. “There was always the request from Man City,” he said. “I think they watched him in one of the SA U17 games, hence the interest in having him on trial and having an assessment, and taking it from there,” Jettoo added. "All of us at Maritzburg United are very proud of Christodino and we wish him all the best over in England. We are confident he'll grab this opportunity with both hands and do himself, the club and the country proud." The Hilton College Christodino is highly-rated by United head coach, Fadlu Davids. In 2016 he became the youngest ever player to play in the MDC at the age of 14.If his trial at City becomes a success, he will be the latest SA-born youngster to move to a top European side. Last week fellow youngster Tashreeq Matthews signed a long-term deal with Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund. The former Ajax Cape Town youth product left the Ikamva-based club in July after training with the German giants.
