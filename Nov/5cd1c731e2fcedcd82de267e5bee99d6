THE ANC in the Eastern Cape has called on Police Minister Bheki Cele to do something about the situation in Port Elizabeth’s Northern areas. For years, innocent people have been caught in the crossfire of gangs engaged in turf wars. On Tuesday morning, Marlon Koopman (43) was gunned down on Rensburg Street in Bethelsdorp, just a day after Sheldon van Schalkwyk (29) was killed on the same street. Earlier this month, Ruaan Willemse (8), Deacon van Rooyen (16) and Chadwin Calvert (17) died in a hail of bullets on Capulet Street. ANC provincial spokesman Gift Ngqondi said: “We condemn the gang violence that has rocked our communities over the past few weeks. “Nothing decisive is being done to address this scourge. Residents are forced to hide inside their homes for fear of being caught in the crossfire.” Ngqondi called on Cele to deploy the anti-gang unit. “The unit must have a dedicated team that focuses on murder and attempted murder, as well as the prevention of organised crime.” Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu referred the SunTeam to national spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, but his phone rang unanswered. During the launch of the anti-gang unit in Hanover Park, Western Cape, earlier this month, national police commissioner General Khehla Sitole said the unit would be deployed to hot spots in other provinces.
