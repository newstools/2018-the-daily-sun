NIGERIA are going for the kill! Bafana Bafana have been warned to prepare for the onslaught. The Super Eagles fans are bracing themselves for an afternoon of celebrations when the two times African champions tackle Bafana in the Africa Cup of Nations Cameroon 2019 Group E qualifying match at the FNB Stadium on Saturday at 3pm. The Super Eagles fans have bought their tickets for the Afcon qualifier and are bragging that they will outnumber the local fans in their own country. Revenge, revenge is the word that has dominated the build-up to the game as Bafana upset the West African powerhouse 2-0 in Nigeria in June 2017 in their first meeting. The Super Eagles are also returning to a scene where they lifted the Africa Cup of Nations following a 1-0 win over Burkina Faso in 2013. The fans are calling for the win in order to honour the late coach Stephen Keshi, who led the Super Eagles to their second continental title. Samuel Onmonya has boldly predicted a comfortable 2-0 victory over Bafana. Onmonya said: “What Bafana did to us was embarrassing, but they must expect an onslaught we are coming for them hard. It’s payback time 2-0 we won’t show them mercy. We are closing our shops to go and honour our fallen hero Keshi with a big win we won’t lose for the second time.” Nigeria were eliminated in the group stages of the Fifa World Cup in Russia in June, but there is high level of optimism from their new look squad. Landu Isabel from Angola is also in support of the Super Eagles. She believes that Bafana will go down 3-1. Isabel said: “Nigeria will be too strong for Bafana. They will score couple of goals.” Innocent Samson of Malawi is also in Nigeria’s corner. The street vendor is not giving Bafana a chance as he believes that the Super Eagles will tear them into shreds. Samson said: “Bafana fans will go home in tears the Super Eagles will be too strong for them to handle. I predict a comfortable win for the Nigerians.”
