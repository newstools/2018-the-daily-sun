FANS of controversial radio host Ngizwe Mchunu and Ukhozi FM listeners marched through the streets of Durban CBD on Saturday demanding the radio station bring him back! The marchers carried placards saying they wanted Mchunu back on air. The aim was to march to Ukhozi FM studios, but the cops stopped them at Workshop Shopping Mall and threatened to arrest them if they proceeded to the studios. SABC sent its communications officer, Lesego Kgwebane, to accept the memorandum at the mall. Kgwebane said she would give the memorandum to the relevant people. Mchunu was let go by the radio station two weeks ago. Although Ukhozi and SABC spokeswoman Neo Momodu have not stated why he was let go, rumours suggest he was accused of leaking the radio station’s affairs to the media. One of the march organisers, Dambayi Mchunu, said they were actually not demanding but pleading with Ukhozi management to bring back Mchunu. “But if they do not respond, we will march to the studios and no cop will stop us,” said Dambayi. When Daily Sun contacted Mchunu, he said he did not want to talk about the issue. “I am glad if there are people who love me, but I don’t want to comment about this.”
