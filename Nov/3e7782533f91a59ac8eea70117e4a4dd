THE TRAIN came in to the station slower than usual,
blasting its horn. But still the driver was unable to avoid plowing through
a large crowd that had packed the active railway bridge to watch a performance
on the streets nearby. Watch the footage below! According to The Straits Times, the nightmare happened in
Surabaya, East Java in Indonesia last Saturday. Indonesia was celebrating its annual National Heroes Day.
Part of the celebrations was a massive art performance near the train station. Hundreds of people took the risk of standing on the railway
bridge, knowing that trains would come through. In the pushing and shoving to get out of the way of the
oncoming train, dozens of people fell meters from the railway bridge. At least three people died and dozens were injured. Transportation Agency’s Directorate General of Railway
Zulkifri was quoted as saying: “This is an accident that no one expects to
experience. Moreover, the tragedy came in a time when the public was happily
commemorating the 2018 National Heroes Day.”
