TWO men are appearing in the Lenasia magistrates Court for allegedly killing 7
family members in Vlakfontein. The bodies of the family were discovered by a tenant, who
suspected something was wrong, because a terrible smell had been coming from
the house for a week. Cops found a pile of sand in one of the bedrooms in the
house. A woman and three children were found underneath the sand. The police continued to a back room in the same yard where
two women and a child were found buried under sand.
