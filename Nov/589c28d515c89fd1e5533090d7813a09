WHEN they applied for an RDP house in 2003, they thought they were going to benefit from the next housing project as promised. But they got the shock of their life in 2007 when they found that the spot in their yard where they had hoped their RDP would be built had two plot numbers – theirs as well as that of their neighbour. The Msomi family from Impola in Mariannhill, near Pinetown told Daily Sun that back then, the project manager and the former ward councillor told them not to panic as they had taken care of the problem. But when the building work was finished, they were shocked to see their neighbour get the keys to the RDP. Siyabonga (32) pleaded with higher authorities to intervene as they have seen that they were fighting a losing battle. “Since 2007 we have been going in and out of eThekwini housing department but the officials are not helping us,” said Siyabonga. The owner of the RDP in question, Lindiwe Mzimela, said: “This is a family matter. Siyabonga’s dad is my uncle. When our late great-grandfather divided sites among our parents, the Msomis sold a portion of theirs and then moved closer to ours.” Ward councillor Nada Ngcobo said: “I am aware of the Msomi and Mzimela matter. In fact, we have about 30 similar cases in my ward. We are in the process of correcting the complication.” eThekwini spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said: “We will investigate the matter and come up with a suitable solution.”
