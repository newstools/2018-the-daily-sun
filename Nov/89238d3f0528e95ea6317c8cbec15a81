The Proteas have won the third and deciding ODI against Australia by 40 runs in Hobart to claim a 2-1 victory in the best of three series. South Africa set the hosts 321 to win thanks to a record 255 run partnership between Faf du Plessis (125) and David Miller (139) who first consolidated and then flayed the Australian attack to all corners of the field after coming together with the Proteas in trouble at 55/3. Dale Steyn saw South Africa off to the best possible start by removing Chris Lynn for a duck in the first over. Lungi Ngidi then had Aaron Finch (11) caught at mid-on by Kagiso Rabada to leave Australia in trouble at 18/2 in the third over. Travis Head (6) followed in the 11th over, a victim of Rabada, caught at point trying to force the pace. That saw Marcus Stoinis join Shaun Marsh at the wicket. After a period of consolidation the pair soon where in their attacking stride and added 107 for the fourth wicket when Stoinis fell to Dwaine Pretorius for 63. Marsh found another willing partner in Alex Carey as they kept South Africa under pressure with some lusty hitting. Marsh (106) went to his ton but was out soon after with Pretorius again making the breakthrough. That brought dangerman Glenn Maxwell to join Carey and the pair added 30 runs in just over three overs before Steyn struck again, removing Carey caught behind for 42 to leave Australia on 256 for 6 and needing 65 off 30 balls It proved a bridge too far for the hosts with Maxwell (35) falling to Steyn and Starc (0) to Rabada as Australia fell short in their effort. Steyn was the pick of the South African bowlers with 3/45 in his 10 overs while Ngidi claimed 2/58, Rabada 3/40 and Pretorius 2/61/ The teams now face off in a lone T20 international taking place on the Gold Coast on November 17.
