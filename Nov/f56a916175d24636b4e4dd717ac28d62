Joburg Water has urged residents of Joburg and surrounding areas to have a 20-litre bucket of water in the case of water cuts. This was after the South African Weather Services advised Gauteng residents to prepare for high temperatures. High temperatures are expected in Gauteng, parts of the Eastern Cape, Free State and North West. Joburg Water spokesman Isaac Dhudhlu told News24 that resident should also use water sparingly. “Our province has challenges of water scarcity at times,” he said. Dhudhlu has also called on residents to keep themselves hydrated by drinking water regularly and carrying water bottles with them. Residents that walk are also urged to carry umbrellas on them. Dhudhlu identified Midrand, northern suburbs of Joburg and parts of Joburg South as areas of high water usage. He has said that where the water systems cannot cope with the load, Joburg Water will start implementing water restrictions. “We will continue to monitor all our reservoirs around the City of Johannesburg, and in those areas where water usage is high,” Dhudhlu said. “As and when water levels in our reservoirs drop because of high demand, we will close them up to build capacity.”
