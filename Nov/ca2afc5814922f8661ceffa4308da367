DAYS after the launch of 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children, Lethiwe Nxumalo fears she will soon end up being killed by her partner. The 32-year-old from Estcourt, KZN midlands, said she was grateful to be alive after her baby daddy almost killed her on Tuesday when she tried to end their relationship. She said he was leader of the local IFP Youth Brigade. When she tried to open a case against him, cops said they could not do it as he had already laid charges against her. “They said I must beg him to withdraw the case so I can go home and sort out the matter. “They saw how bad my injuries were, but they sent me back home so he could finish me off.” Lethiwe said she did not know who to turn to for help to leave her abusive relationship. “We met in 2013 and we have two kids. Our relationship was good until he started beating me in 2016. “He even beat me when I was pregnant,” she said. “Things got worse when he started dating a policewoman. “He now comes to my house and beats me, knowing he will not be arrested.” Lethiwe said she wanted cops to help her by locking her abusive boyfriend away before he killed her. Daily Sun called her boyfriend, but he asked to be called back after five minutes because he was busy with the cops. When the SunTeam phoned him later, he did not answer. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala advised Lethiwe to see the station manager.
