GO AND collect your ID. This is a request from Home Affairs at Ekurhuleni Municipality. Officials said there’s a huge pile of IDs that haven’t been collected. According to the municipality, there are more than 19 000 smart IDs and more than 1 500 green bar-coded IDs that haven’t been collected. Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said: “The municipality urges residents to collect their IDs so that they can register to vote during the voter registration period on 26 and 27 January.” He said uncollected IDs were also affecting municipal services. “People won’t be able to get title deeds for their RDPs without IDs. They’ll also not benefit from services such as the free water, free electricity and indigent rebates programmes,” Gadebe said the municipality was working with Home Affairs to enure IDs were collected. “The municipality is providing free transport to the elderly, people living with disabilities, pupils and military veterans to collect their IDs.” He said the municipality has also used its outreach programme, Siyaqhuba, to urge people to speed up their application and collection of birth certificates and IDs.
