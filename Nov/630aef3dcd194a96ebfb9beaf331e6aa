First motorists were warned not to do the #IdibalaChallenge while driving. But now the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) wants the Idibala hit maker to be the road safety ambassador. RTMC has allegedly approached King Monada. They want him to be their ambassador for the festive season. King Monada and his camp reportedly received a letter from the RTMC asking him to be their ambassador. Speaking to Daily Sun, Monada’s manager Albert Makwala said that they have received the letter last week. “The letter was sent on the strength of drivers’ responses to the song, and how performing the dance will pose danger on the roads,” Makwala said. “We will respond to the letter in due time.” Makwala said that the letter requested to engage with King Monada, and Makwala expects the nitty-gritties to be ironed out during the engagements. “They feel like perhaps if Monada becomes an ambassador, drivers will be able to listen to him.” Makwala also said that the engagements will determine how Monada will work with the RTMC. He indicated that the RTMC was not clear on what role it expects King Monada to play during the festive season. “He is fully booked for the entire December period,” Makwala said.
