THE North Gauteng High Court has ordered the VBS Mutual Bank to be
liquidated. This after the Reserve Bank applied to the court, to have the bank
liquidated. The “Great Bank Heist”
report, led to the bank being placed under curatorship. At least R1.5bn was allegedly looted from the bank and used by
executives who bought, among other items, luxury vehicles. On March 11 VBS was placed under curatorship, and
SizweNtsalubaGobodo Advisory Services (Proprietary) Limited, represented by
Anoosh Rooplal, was appointed to deal with the saga. VBS Mutual Bank being liquidated should NOT be celebrated. It's a really sad day! #VBS #VBSmutualbank
