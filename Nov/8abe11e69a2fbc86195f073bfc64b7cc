HE would hang around food stalls and lure his victims to
him with sweeties. Then he would rape the little girls, often breaking their
legs with bricks first – apparently because it turned him on. Then he killed the children. This is according to news.com.au, which is reporting that
a man named only as ‘Sunil’ was bust by cops last week after a three-year-old
girl’s body was discovered in Gurugram, a city south west of New Delhi in India,
on 12 November. The child’s remains were found less than 300m from where
she disappeared one day earlier. The coroner said the toddler had been raped and her head
bashed in with a brick. On Tuesday, Sunil was arrested about 515kms away, in
Magarpur village, Uttar Pradesh. During his interrogation by cops over the little girl’s
death, Sunil reportedly confessed to have done the same evil deed eight times
before. Investigating Officer Sumit Kuhar said: “Authorities are shocked
by his confessions as he not only raped and killed three young girls in
Gurugram but four in Delhi, one in Jhansi and another in Gwalior in the last
two years”. Sunil reportedly told police that breaking his victims’
legs with a brick before raping them was a “ritual that aroused him”. “He chose children who were alone and away from their
homes. He told us all he wanted was tasty food and young girls to satisfy his
lust.” Sunil would allegedly lure his victims with sweets and
chocolates and then attack them in abandoned areas before dumping their bodies. Cops say he was difficult to trace because he is
unemployed and homeless. Investigations are continuing.
