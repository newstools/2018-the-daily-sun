THE controversial Delangokubona Business Forum has distanced itself from the invasion of RDP flats after SACP members marched to the flats at H section in Umlazi, south of Durban, yesterday. The marchers accused the forum of forcibly removing people that were allocated houses last year. The marchers gave the occupants 14 days to vacate the flats or residents would evict them. The march was led by SACP leaders including provincial chairman James Nxumalo, eThekwini regional chairman Phumlani Mthembu and Ward 79 councillor Sthenjwa Nyawose. Delangokubona secretary Thulani Myeza said the forum had been wrongly accused. He said the forum was not involved, but one of their leaders was among the people who occupied the flats. “Our members are there in their individual capacity and aren’t representing the organisation. “We’re businesspeople, not land grabbers,” said Myeza. Police had to intervene when the marchers clashed with the occupants. One of the marchers pointed at her flat and said she was evicted at gunpoint by people who said they were forum members. She had been living at the complex for two weeks when she was forced out. Thami Mdluli accepted the marchers’ memorandum on behalf of eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede. Councillor Nyawose said after the march a group of people led by a forum group leader told him the occupants would leave – but only in coffins. Delangokubona is known for violent confrontations with construction companies and demanding to be part of their projects.
