THE mother of a one-month-old baby girl is pleading with SunReaders to save them from a bleak Christmas. A fire has destroyed Nontobeko Khonkwane’s shack and three others, leaving them homeless. The 35-year-old from Nomzamo, Strand, said had the police not kicked open her door, she would have died with her baby, Olothando. “It was after 1am last Monday and I did not hear anything. “My neighbours realised I was not coming out and they asked that my door be opened,” she said. She managed to save her pyjamas, but everything else including her baby’s food was destroyed by the fire. “A kind person gave me the clothes I am wearing and a blanket to cover Olothando, but I do not know where I’ll get food for my baby.” Fire and rescue spokesman Edward Bosch said another fire broke out in Nomzamo on the same day. “The fire in Simon Street left eight people homeless, while the while the one in Ndzuzo Street left 27 without homes.” Councillor Jongidumo Maxeke said he called municipal officials and they promised to deliver building material. “They said they were experiencing a shortage after the fires in Khayelitsha, but they promised to deliver,” said Maxeke. “I am also helping the victims to get food and other essential items.” City of Cape Town Disaster Risk Management spokeswoman Charlotte Powell confirmed the shortages, but said they were working hard to deliver.
