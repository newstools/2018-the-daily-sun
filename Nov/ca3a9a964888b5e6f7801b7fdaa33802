RESIDENTS woke up to the sound of gunfire as the attackers shot at anything they came across. When the shooting eventually stopped, the gunmen jumped into a double-cab van and sedan and raced off into the night. Residents of Langaville in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun windows were shattered by bullets, and fridges and furniture were damaged in the Tuesday night attack. When the terrified people came out from under beds and stepped outside, they stumbled on the body of a tenant, a foreigner who could not be identified. When they went into the house they found the bodies of Bulelwa (50) and Xolile Buyambo (32), as well as that of Sandise Sethathi (14). Another relative was still breathing. He was taken to hospital, where he’s fighting for his life. Gogo Glenrose Mphunga said that, seeing that their tenant was an illegal miner, they suspected the fight might have been over gold dust. “We’re told the victims were accused of giving the tenant a place to stay,” said the gogo. “How could they have known he was a criminal?” Captain Johannes Ramphora said the dead tenant had only been there a few days. “We’re told he was a friend of the other tenant who’s supposed to be the gold dealer. That man fled before the gunmen arrived.” According to Ramphora, the man who’s in hospital said they were sitting in the house when they heard gunshots. The door was kicked open. One of the men allegedly shouted: “Why are you harbouring criminals?” Then they started shooting at everyone in the house. It appears there were about six suspects. Four cases of murder were opened.
