WITH the heatwave battering Mzansi, it’s time to let your feet breathe. Birkenstock introduced a fourth footwear store in Joburg and it has many big specials offered among its footwear. Chantel Schultz, managing director of the footwear brand, said buying the right shoes is an investment in foot health. She said the heat is telling us that people need to put away their closed shoes and wear open, comfortable footwear. Their stores in Morningside Shopping Centre and Benmore Gardens in Joburg will open from 9am to 6pm, while two other shops in Claremont and Somerset West in Cape Town will open from 9am to 7pm – all from Monday to Sunday. Chantel said they also have a handy manicure business in Tshwane and they are planning to open a fifth footwear store if the demand rises. “Our mission is to grow our presence in the main cities of Mzansi. “We understand that opening a new store not only brings a new shopping experience to people but also work opportunities for work seekers in the local community. She said, as one of South Africa’s best-selling healthy footwear brands, they are planning to educate more young people about the benefits of wearing quality and healthy footwear. “We sell quality shoes and our pricing is very reasonable. With the new store we opened recently, many customers have visited us to buy our shoes.” She said as summer and Christmas are just around the corner, more and more people will be buying from them. Birkenstock shoes are for kids, men and women, while some are unisex.
