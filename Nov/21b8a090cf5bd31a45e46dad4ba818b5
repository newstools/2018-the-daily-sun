FORMER Bidvest Wits striker Ryan Chapman has not ruled out the possibility of playing in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) again. The 31-year-old’s career has taken a nosedive since he left Bidvest Wits in 2016. He went on to resurrect his career in the National First Division (NFD) with Stellenbosch, Pretoria University and Royal Eagles. But when he realised the game he loves was not bearing any fruit, Chapman decided to put his career on hold. The last time he played competitive football was in January when he played for Eagles. Since then he has been idle at home. Explained Chapman: “Currently I am not playing for any club. I am not even kicking a ball. I have been busy with other things in my life. I mean, sometimes you need to make tough decisions in your life and I have done that.” Even though Chapman’s boots are currently gathering dust at home, the speedy player says the thought of hanging them up for good has not crossed his mind. “I still have few more years to play football at the highest level,” he said. “I will start training again once I am done with the project I am busy with. But I have no doubt I will regain my fitness because I can still run. I still feel strong enough to play a competitive match.” Chapman had a lot to offer when he joined Wits from Santos in Cape Town in 2010. His career blossomed as he was rewarded with five Bafana Bafana call-ups back in 2012. However, his promising career took a knock as he struggled to cement a regular place in the Clever Boys starting lineup and as a result he was loaned out to SuperSport United and later Golden Arrows, where he also had a tough time making an impact. It remains to be seen if he still has what it takes to bounce back to the PSL’s land of milk and honey.
