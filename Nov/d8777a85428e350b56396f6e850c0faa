Just days before Motswako rapper, HHP is laid to rest, drama unfolds! HHP's customary wife, Lerato Sengadi is taking her father-in-law, Robert Tsambo to court in a bid to stop the family from proceeding with any funeral arrangements. The funeral is scheduled to take place in Mahikeng on Saturday. Sengadi was declared lawful customary wife to Jabulani 'HHP' Tsambo in February 2016.
