BLACK LEOPARDS coach Joel Masutha says his future at the club doesn’t depend on their next game. Leopards take on Cape Town City in their Absa Premiership encounter at Cape Town Stadium today (3.30pm). Lidoda Duvha have not been winning matches or scoring goals lately, and that could spell disaster for Masutha. The Limpopo-based outfit have not won a single game in their past six games in all competitions, and that could trigger reaction from management. But Masutha is as cool as a cucumber and insists his future does not hang in the balance at the club, as far as he knows. Masuthu said: “I’d like to believe that management supports me. I may be wrong, I don’t know. But I believe I still have their backing. “People talk about pressure and that’s the nature of the game. I won’t relax and think I’m safe – because people want results. “The only time I’ll relax is when I own a soccer team like Jomo Sono.” Masutha is confident his team can upset the Citizens in their own backyard. “We’re going to Cape Town to enjoy the conditions and to win. I believe we can take on anyone, anywhere, without fear, and still win the game. “I will never give up on this team. I will also always be here to support my players. I still believe in them and know they can start winning matches,” he said. Masutha says they will go back to training and start working on their goal-scoring problems. The modest coach said he has seen many teams in the league bounce back to their winning ways and that he’s confident that he can also do the same. “But my future doesn’t rest on what happens in Cape Town today,” he said. Veteran striker Abia Nale is training with Lidoda Duvha, and Masutha says the club is considering bringing him on board. “The team is hoping to sign him. He’s still in good condition.”
