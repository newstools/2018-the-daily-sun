TWO men accused of killing a Vlakfontein family appeared in a dark court yesterday. The case against Ernest Mabaso (27) and Fifita Khupe (61) was postponed after a power failure in the Lenasia Magistrates Court, south of Joburg. The accused spent some time in the holding cells. At about noon they entered court and were told by prosecutor Tumelo Maunye that the power failure had been caused by burnt-out electric cables. He said it could take the whole day to fix the problem. Magistrate Maggie van der Merwe postponed the case, saying nothing in the court worked without electricity. She said the matter had to be heard within two days as she was going on leave at the end of the week. “Hopefully, we’ll have electricity then and proceed with your bail application.” The accused allegedly killed seven members of the Khoza family and stole bank cards. Cops found the bodies of three women and four kids inside a house in Vlakfontein last month. The men are facing murder charges. Mabaso faces three additional counts of rape. Meanwhile, Vlakfontein residents gathered outside court and demanded that the men shouldn’t be given bail. Councillor Ace Mokoenyane told Daily Sun: “We’ve put together a petition signed by Vlakfontein residents and neighbouring communities. “We were supposed to submit it today but couldn’t because there was no electricity in court. “We don’t want these people back in our communities.”
