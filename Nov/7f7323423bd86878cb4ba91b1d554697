Local beauty queen turned TV personality and media mogul, Basetsana Kumalo is reminiscing on one the greatest chapters in her life, the chapter that started it all. The Top Billing executive’s illustrious career started back in 1994 when she was the reigning Miss South Africa, an opportunity that opened countless doors for her and ultimately led her to where she is now. Bassie’s reign was one of the most iconic reigns in the 60-year history of the pageant, not only because of her style and grace, but also in her ability to capture the nation’s heart. She of course went on to achieve insurmountable fame and wealth since then, placing her among Africa’s most powerful women in entertainment and business. And she herself has not forgotten how it all started. “I forever remain indebted for this chapter of my life,” she said as she remembered participating in the 1994 Miss World pageant. On the 21st of November 1994, Bassie represent South Africa at the 44th Miss World pageant, in which she was crowned the first princess. What made this moment even more iconic was that the pageant took place on Mzansi shores at the Sun City Superbowl in Rustenburg. Bassie competed against 86 other beauty queens from around the world and the title went to then Miss India turned Hollywood star, Aishwarya Rai. I forever remain indebted for this chapter of my life. ???????????? #Repost @proudlysabeauties with @get_repost ··· On this day exactly 24 years ago gorgeous @basetsanakumalo competed against 86 other women for the 44th Miss World title at the Sun City Superbowl, South Africa. From the moment the pageant started and the contestants started arriving in SA Basetsana impressed with her undeniable beauty and charm. She almost snatched the crown, but ultimately placed as 1st Runner-up to another crowd favourite - beautiful @aishwaryaraibachchan_arb of India, who became her country’s 2nd Miss World. Irene Ferreira of Venezuela placed 3rd. This has to be one of my all-time favourite editions of Miss World! I loved everything from the contestant introductions, judges, presenters and the beautiful stage. And don’t get me started on the Top 10 finalists - they were magnificent! It included a diverse group of beauties from Croatia, Zimbabwe, UK, Malaysia, Belgium, Philippines and Greece. Sweet Rahima Orchient Yayah (Miss Malaysia) even ended her speech with ‘baie dankie!’ (Afrikaans for thank you). Any one of these women would have made a remarkable titleholder. What I miss most about the old days is the absolute glamour and spectacle of the final show and this edition had it in spades! It was a global event that attracted the who’s who of the world. It had stature, class and will be remembered by many as one of the finest. #missworld #missworld1994 #missmundo #missworldsouthafrica #missworldindia #basetsanakumalo #aishwaryarai #ireneferreira #missworldvenezuela #???? #proudlysabeauties #misssa #misssouthafrica #misssa1994 #southafrican #beautyqueen #queen #?? #pageant #missindia #misscroatia #missmalaysia #missphilippines #missbelgium #misszimbabwe #missgreece #missunitedkingdom A post shared by  Basetsana Kumalo (@basetsanakumalo) on Nov 21, 2018 at 5:07am PST
