THE Celeb GP, is all I have to say and if you a car guy in Mzansi you have to know I’m talking about Fantasy Ridez Customs. Fantasy Ridez Customs is home to Celeb GP, were car witchcraft takes place in broad daylight. Think custom boot setup, air suspension, leather interior and sunroofs they can do it, but you see they started from the bottom – and now they customise rides that cost in the region of a million.  The owner of Fantasy Ridez Customs Tariq Moosa, says as a kid he used to customise model cars and has always wanted to be in the industry of custom rides. “We started off with a lot of Beetle’s, Citi Golf’s and BMW E30’s and then people saw what we do – and eventually it grew to doing R700k Dodges and Porsches,” Moosa said. Moosa says the business was established in 2007, operating from a single garage doing it on the part-time basis. He says eventually when the demand grew, he opted to quit his job and focus on his business. In the background, you can see the famous 1988 E30 325i pillar-less known as the Celeb GP, Golf 6 R, the classic Chevy Impala, Volkswagen kombi split window and a Porsche 911. In case you didn’t know now you do, the Celeb is originally from the United Kingdom – it was imported to Mzansi in 1998. According to Moosa, they have played with the motor and it runs a 2.9 stroker motor and has a custom leather interior. On the exterior, the Celeb sits low on a custom air suspension and rolls on a set of chrome BBS rims.
