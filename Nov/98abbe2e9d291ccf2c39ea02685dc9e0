MZANSI’s high unemployment rate has forced many to do whatever it takes to put food on the table. A large number of women from the OR Tambo region earn a living by recycling metal. The women put up with bad weather while trying to get a lift to a scrapyard in Isipingo, south of Durban. Noziphiwe Diko (58), from Maiden Farm, Mthatha, said she spent five days on the N2 to Durban. She said she hoped a truck driver would give her a lift. “We sleep here. The weather changes all the time, but we have to stay. We can’t leave our metal here because people would steal it,” said Noziphiwe. Thandeka Felanto (47) from Slovo in Mthatha said she slept near the freeway for two days. She pleaded with government to provide recyclers with transport to Durban. “There are scrapyards in Mthatha, but they don’t pay as well as the ones in Durban.” “I have to support eight kids and my grandchildren with the money I make. “I also have to pay their school fees, which is why I risk my life by sleeping here. “We’re pleading with government leaders and the municipality to help us.” Neziswa Giqwa (45) from Ncise said she had been recycling for four years. “Sometimes we wait for about a week before we get transport. It’s hard but we have to do this to support our families,” she said. King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality spokesman Sonwabo Mampoza said: “We support people who create opportunities for themselves. “But in this case there is little we can do because we have to follow certain processes. “There has never been an application for our intervention in this matter.”
