MZWANELE Manyi will has allowed advocate Vincent Maleka to cross-examine him. Earlier on Tuesday morning Manyi had said that he was no longer willing to continue if evidence leader advocate Vincent Maleka continues to interrogate him. He wanted Maleka to recuse himself. MANYI: I DON'T WANT MALEKA! But after a short break Manyi informed the commission that he has changed his mind saying he did not “want to frustrate the work of the commission”. The head of the commission of inquiry into state capture’s legal team advocate Paul Pretorius, SC, told the chair of the commission that Manyi has changed his mind about the application for Advocate Vincent Maleka to recuse himself as evidence leader. Pretorius said Manyi said that was prepared to continue with his testimony with Maleka as evidence leader and that if he has any difficulties in relation to any question, he would maybe raise it with Zondo.
