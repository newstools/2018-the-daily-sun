THE Toto family has been living without electricity for over a year. The family from Lower Crossroads in Philippi, Cape Town, told Daily Sun their prepaid meter was destroyed in a fire last June. Thembelani Toto (23) said they have contacted Eskom several times, visited their offices in Bellville and flagged down workers driving past, but their problem has still not been fixed. Thembelani said his family was now getting electricity from their neighbour. “It’s only a recent thing because we used to make a fire outside to cook and stay warm when it was cold,” he said. “We have tried everything in our power to get electricity. We can’t live like this.” Eskom spokeswoman Bulelwa Ncobo said the family should go to their customer service offices in Bellville to get information about the process they needed to follow to have a prepaid meter installed.
