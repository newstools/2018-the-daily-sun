RESIDENTS were horrified to learn pupils were responsible for a massive fire at their school on Monday. The pupils of Tweespruit Primary School, Free State, allegedly gained entrance through a back fence and petrol bombed the school. They destroyed a container filled with books and other learning materials. Residents said they had not had water for three days and they believed the container could have been saved if the taps were not dry. A resident said: “I heard residents blowing a whistle after the fire broke out at the school. “We had to rush to a nearby dam to get water. “Pupils who are gangsters started the fire because they believed they were going to fail. “This means other pupils can’t go to school because their books have been destroyed.” Mantsopa Municipality’s acting technical director Dumile Nana confirmed there was a water crisis in the area. “As the municipality, we have already identified a place where we can extract water by drilling a borehole. “We’ll hire a contractor and hopefully by March, the problem will be resolved.” Police spokesman Sergeant Martin Xuma confirmed the incident. “Two pupils aged eight and 12 set the container alight but no case has been opened and no injuries were reported. “Old books were stored inside the container. We advise parents to monitor their children and ensure they don’t play with fire,” he said. Provincial education spokesman Howard Ndaba said they were aware of the incident. “One of the pupils has behavioural problems. “We’re going to send out social workers to assist the pupils,” he said.
