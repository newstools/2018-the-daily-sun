SHE has been called all sorts of names over the years like a gold digger, who doesn’t want to work but only date older rich men to supplement her lavish lifestyle, but those days are long gone, because Khanyi Mbau’s grind is fleek. In addition to being an industrious actress, the star can now be called a businesswoman. This as she has launched her own Gin I am Khanyi Mbau Millennial Shimmer Gin. With all that she’s accomplished this year, it’s safe to say that 2018 has been good to Khanyi as she slayed every chance she got, even in Mzansi Magic’s gripping drama Abomama. The Gin will officially be launched on the 1st of December.
