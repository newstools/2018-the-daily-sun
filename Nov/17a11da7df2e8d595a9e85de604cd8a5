THE star studded line-up of Black Coffee’s inaugural Music is King Concert just keeps getting better and better. The much anticipated concert is set to take place on the 15th of December at the Ticket Pro Dome in Johannesburg. Black Coffee has added American super producer Swizz Beatz to the already impressive list of talent set entertain music fans at the concert. Swizz Beatz, who is no stranger to Mzansi having been in the country earlier this year, will join African heavyweights in the likes of Nasty C, Lady Zamar, Burna Boy and Riky Rick on stage at the concert. “Happy to announce the final addition to Music is King Concert, Swizz Beatz – You don’t want to miss this one,” Black Coffee tweeted. With the concert only a few weeks away now, fans are growing increasingly impatient – looking forward to the big day.
