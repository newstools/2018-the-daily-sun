Mazda has unveiled the fourth generation of its successful Mazda 3 range. The new range was unveiled at the L.A Motor Show looking strikingly similar to the concept we saw last year at the Tokyo Motor Show. The Kai concept was a beautiful thing and the new 3's design keeps all the things we like about the concept. The long bonnet, the big grille and the sleek headlights are much welcomed in the front end. The back too is sleek, uncluttered. Look the design is definitely an evolution rather than a revolution. The car is still easily recognized as a Mazda 3 but it looks new. The sedan too is arguably the best looking in its segment. The interior is the same thing. It is not as bold as we saw in the Kai concept but it definitely looks, clean, modern and upmarket. The Mazda CX-9 in the US has Apple CarPlay, so we are guessing the new Mazda 3 will get it too. The infotainment in Mazdas is good but Android Auto and CarPlay would definitely bring it up a notch or two. The new car is based on Mazda's new Skyactiv-Vehicle Architecture. Driving it is a new lineup of Skyactiv-X, Skyactiv-G and Skyactiv-D engines. Skyactiv-X is a petrol engine that works a bit like a diesel, meaning that it delivers the performance a petrol engine with the efficiency of a diesel. It is also complemented by a 24-volt mild-hybrid system. The new 3 is expected to hit our shore in mid-2019.
