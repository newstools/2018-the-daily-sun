THEY believe a strange wind that blew off eight roofs in their kasi was sent by evil people. Residents of Khutsong, near Carletonville in Gauteng, said they had just gone to bed on Tuesday night when the wind came up out of nowhere, damaging the houses and a church. Matshidiso Tautswane (32) said: “The wind was strong but I didn’t realise it could blow off my roof. I was afraid. When I went outside I heard screaming. I then realised I wasn’t the only one affected.” She said the wind became very strong at about 10pm. “It was windy all day but not as strong as it became later in the evening. Fortunately there were police patrolling so the matter was handled immediately,” said Matshidiso. A neighbour said it was a sign from the ancestors and residents should not ignore it. “If it was just bad weather, half of the houses here would have been damaged, but it only affected a few people. Those who believe in the ancestors should go and see traditional healers,” he said. Cops, councillors, Eskom officials and municipal disaster management officials were all at the scene. Police spokesman Captain Eddie Boboko said fortunately no one was injured. “Some people have already fixed their roofs,” he said. Station commander Colonel Melinda Prinsloo said sector vehicles would keep an eye on the affected houses. “We have to make sure that despite this incident the residents are safe and no tsotsi is taking advantage of the situation,” said Prinsloo.
