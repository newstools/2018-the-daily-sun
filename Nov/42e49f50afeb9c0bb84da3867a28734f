FOOTBALL fanatics have been treated to two Bafana Bafana matches and the two Telkom Knockout semi-finals over the past two weeks. Tonight, all the attention turns to the much anticipated return of the Absa Premiership with midweek fixtures that promises fireworks. Struggling Maritzburg United welcome equally troubled Chippa United at the Harry Gwala Stadium in the first game. The two teams are only separated by a point on the standings with the Chilli Boys occupying position number 15 with 9 points. The Team of Choice are second from bottom with 8 points and look like a shadow of the side that finished eighth last season. They are the only team so far this season with only one victory under their belt. The second game will see Cape Town City travel to Limpopo to face Polokwane City at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. Benny McCarthy’s Citizens are in fine form having scored six goals in their last two games, victory against Polokwane will see them climb above Rise and Shine into the top 8 as the two teams are also separated by a single point in position 7 and 8 on the log. AmaZulu will have their hands full when they travel to face Highlands Park at the Makhulong Stadium in the third game of the night. The Lions of the North have turned the Makhulong into somewhat of a fortress this season with the majority of their 12 points coming at home. They are sitting in position 10 on the log in their first season back in the big time where they appear to be holding their own so far. All games kick off at 7:30pm
