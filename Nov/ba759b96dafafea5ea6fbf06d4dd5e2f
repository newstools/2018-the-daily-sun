ON MONDAY, over 100 shacks were gutted at Downstairs section of Jumpers squatter camp in Cleveland, Joburg. Residents had came out with claims that shacks were being set alight in the hope of getting early Christmas gifts. People told Daily Sun they set their shacks on fire every November, knowing they’ll get brand new beds, food, clothes and blankets But now other residents have noticed the trend and warned them to stop. They worry greedy behaviour like this will prevent those who really need help from getting it in future. “This is unfair on our government and Good Samaritans who open their hearts to help. “This has to stop. This is done deliberately by the same people who stay in one section. “They take their valuables and stand on the side, waiting for the shacks to catch fire.” “In winter, we have more fires than any other squatter camp to warm ourselves, but no shack goes up in flames, not even one. “They wait for November just to get early Christmas goodies.” On Monday, some of the valuables saved could be seen lying not far from the burnt shacks. Joburg Emergency Services officials, who also noticed the trend said they decided to provide only the necessities this time and only to victims. To avoid duplication, community leaders wrote down the names of all the victims. Leader Nomphelo Zozo said: “We watch against doubling up. Previously, people used to claim they were victims when they were not.” Each name was called from a list and the victim was told to stand where his shack was to prevent cheating. Emergency spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said the cause of the fire was unknown and they were investigating. No one was injured but two people were treated for smoke inhalation.
