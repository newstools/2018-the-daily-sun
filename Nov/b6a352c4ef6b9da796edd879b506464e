ENDLOVINI squatters in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth are tired of suffering. They want water, electricity and proper roads. Sandisiwe Nyebeya (29) told Daily Sun: “We will have a black Christmas because we don’t have communal taps in the area. “We’re forced to buy water in the nearby kasi for R15 for a 20 litre bucket. “Most of us are not employed. We survive on child support grants. “Some of use pit toilets behind our shacks, while other people relieve themselves in the nearby bush. “We also don’t have electricity.” Community leader Msindisi Makeleni said: “I’ve tried several times to organise a meeting with the municipality’s infrastructure officials, but with no luck. “The area has about 1 000 households. We’ve been living here for two years. We also deserve basic services like other people. “We need water, electricity, toilets and proper roads.” Msindisi said they also have a problem of stray animals. “Stray animals often drink dirty water. “We appeal to the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality to help improve the living conditions of the squatters.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “The squatters have occupied the land illegally, so it’s hard to provide services in the area. “Fortunately for them, there’a new council resolution concerning evictions. “But the municipality might still consider providing services to the area.”
