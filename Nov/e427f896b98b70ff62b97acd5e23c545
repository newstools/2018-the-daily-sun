RESIDENTS of W section in Khayelitsha are happy after the municipality removed the bin of horror from their kasi. The People’s Paper published the story on Friday under the headline, “Bin’s not worth all the trouble”. Residents said they tried several times to get it removed without success, until they decided to use it to block the side of Mew Way Road. Noluthando Plaatjie (30) said: “We’re happy the bin left, with its big rats! “It was no longer serving any good. It was used for wrong things in our kasi. “We also thank Daily Sun for writing about it. We were tired of asking the municipality to act.” People who used the road every day said they feared for their lives whenever they passed the container at night. It was known as a hiding spot for thugs. Lungile Mdoda (26) said: “I’m relieved now because when I come from the shebeen, I know nobody will ambush me. “A friend of mine lost his phone to thugs at this spot in July,” he said. Two weeks ago, street committee chairman Simphiwe Ncande said they’d had enough. Nyaope smokers and cable thieves were apparently using it as their hiding spot. “We’ve had enough of horrible things happening at this container. “Addicts do drugs here and big rats that have terrorised our kasi live in this container.” Khayelitsha councillor Anda Ntsodo said the container had rats, because people didn’t use it properly. “Containers are kept locked to prevent rodents from breeding inside. “But many residents dispose of household waste including food scraps next to the containers, which led to problems with pests,” Ntsodo said.
