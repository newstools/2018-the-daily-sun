THE NGO Doctors Without Borders shared disturbing rape statistics with the media yesterday. Releasing a report on the matter in Newtown, Joburg, yesterday, the organisation said one in four women living in Rustenburg, North West, had been raped. Panellists from different fields of medicine and the North West health department discussed the report. It was highly critical of the health department’s failure to provide mental healthcare to many victims of sexual violence. The report said: “In total, the health department has designated 265 public health facilities across all provinces to provide medical and psychological care to survivors of sexual violence. “Of these, 55 designated facilities are meant to attend to survivors’ medical, mental health, social care and legal needs.” The NGO conducted telephone surveys with half the 265 public health facilities across South Africa supposed to help people who have suffered sexual violence. Forty five percent of the facilities indicated they do not provide counselling for children.According to the report, studies show that only one in 25 rape cases is reported. According to SAPS data, there are 71 rapes per 100 000 people, meaning 50 000 rapes are reported each year. Between 314 000 and 785 000 people aged between 15 and 17 were sexually abused between 2013 and 2015. The organisation called on the government to prioritise mental health care for victims of sexual and gender-based violence. Dr Amir Shroufi, medical co-ordinator for the NGO, said 49% of facilities said counselling was handled by people not qualified as psychologists or psychiatrists. “This kind of healthcare provider cannot be expected to manage all aspects of serious psychiatric conditions caused by sexual violence,” he said.
