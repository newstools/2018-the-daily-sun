BEKKERSDAL cops and various interested people held an awareness campaign  at the taxi rank on Wednesday. The campaign was aimed at supporting the 16 Days of Activism for no Violence Against Women and Children, which starts on 25 November. Sergeant Linkie Lefakane said they, along with patrollers, they also wanted to raise awareness about drug and substance abuse and give safety tips. “One on ones with community members were held on issues relating to crime,” said Lefakane. “The community was encouraged to report crime and talk to children regarding safety during the school holidays.” About 500 pamphlets were distributed, she said. Lefakane said: “The victim was allegedly assaulted by a group of community members after he was accused of housebreaking.” He was taken to hospital and later reported the matter to the police. The suspects were arrested by Bekkersdal detectives. Station commander Colonel Tinus Swart condemned the violence. He urged people to report crime to the police and not to take the law into their own hands.
