T he RAF’s Forensic and Investigation Department (FID) hunts down fraudsters with great success. Over the last 5 years, the RAF has stopped over R2 billion’s worth of fraudulent claims before payment. In the same period, 1,914 convictions and 912 arrests were made by the National Prosecuting Authority and police. The FID has employed qualified people with a range of skills focusing on external investigations, corporate investigations, prosecutions, fraud awareness and cyber fraud in order to ensure that the RAF keeps to its Fraud Prevention Policy. Both external and internal stakeholders, including attorneys, police, medical doctors, employees and touts, abuse the RAF funds, and the necessary action has been taken against them. The RAF does not tolerate the giving and receiving of bribes, or anti-competitive practices in dealings with government and in the marketplace. Employees are not allowed to make contributions or donations for political purposes, and may not ask or accept gifts, or money from any service provider, attorney or claimant. As a caring arm of government, the RAF is able to deal with corruption and protect money that is meant for road accident victims, while applying good corporate governance, because of the continued support from government and South Africans. The RAF remains committed to ensuring that the organisation is run professionally and that any wrongdoing is dealt with justly. The public is encouraged to report any suspected acts of corruption on the RAF toll free fraud line number: 0800 00 59 19.
