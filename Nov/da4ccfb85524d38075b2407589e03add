THE safer season crime-fighting campaign will make life more difficult for criminals. “We will make criminals uncomfortable,” said Police Minister Bheki Cele at the official launch of the campaign at Motherwell NU2 Stadium in Port Elizabeth yesterday. The minister kicked things off by talking to commuters at Uitenhage Train Station and Motherwell Taxi Rank. Cele was accompanied by his deputy Bongani Mkongi, national police commissioner General Khehla Sitole, and Eastern Cape Safety and Liaison MEC Weziwe Tikana. Cele urged the public to work with the police. “Today we displayed our strength as police and strengthened our relationship with the community. “Criminals have restless nights because we’re arresting them while they’re planning. “We want them to go away because we’re not going to share our space with them.” Cele said criminals were armed and dangerous. General Sitole said: “We will be present on all our beaches and public spaces. “All those who try to commit crime will have major problems.”
