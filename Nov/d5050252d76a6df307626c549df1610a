THE Equal Education movement wants government to do more to fix schools, especially in rural areas. It launched its report on school infrastructure at Isivivana Centre in Khayelitsha, Cape Town yesterday. The movement said it was concerned at the pace with which government was building schools in Mzansi. Between 2009 and last year, government, through its Accelerated School Infrastructure Delivery Initiative had built only 196 schools in the Eastern Cape, while there was a backlog of 471 schools in that province alone. Equal Education’s junior co-ordinator in the Eastern Cape, Itumeleng Mothlabane, said several contractors who were supposed to build schools had not done so because there was no proper management in the province, which they took advantage of. “Some school have no toilets. Pupils have to use the veld to relieve themselves, while teachers go to their houses to relieve themselves,” said Mothlabane. Equal Education said so far, it had managed to push the Eastern Cape government to allocate R30 million. This will ensure classrooms at Xhentse Senior Secondary School in Libode are built and the mud structures at Nyandeni Junior Secondary School and at the new Chief Henry Bokleni Secondary School in Libode are eradicated.
