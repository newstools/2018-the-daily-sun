WHEN she is not fighting social media trolls, who often come at her and her family, she is busy growing her media empire. The star shared a heart-warming message to her friend veteran actress Florence Masebe, who three years ago lost her son, who drowned in the swimming pool of their home. Florence is always fighting for the rights of entertainers to be recognised, but this time she is the one who was on the spotlight, as her friend Basetsana told her on Instagram how much she admires her fighting spirit, even in the face of adversity. She wrote: “today has been such a special day celebrating this woman I call my sister, my friend and my treasure. You know in life you meet people and beings and their essence, truth and authenticity reminds you on how an intentional life embedded in truth is so beautiful. Today is also a bitter sweet day, when my friend’s son Mukololo Masakona Matsila made his sudden escape from us 3 years ago at 18 months. Mbado! Matunu Thavhani! Mulaudzi Wa Govhamasenga! Choma @flomasebe you are a true epitome of a soul so unwavering in her pursuit of living a meaningful and present life. You inspire me in so many ways, I count it all joy to call you my sister and my friend. May Divine blessings pursue relentlessly all the days of your life, May you always know how much you are loved, as for me friend...ndi ni funa nga maanda. ?? Happy birthday ??????????
