CITIZENS of Mzansi might as well put a packet of candles next to the bed where they can easily find it in the dark – just in case. Eskom said the power system remains tight and vulnerable and there is a reasonable chance of load shedding from today for the rest of week. The company said it continues to use gas engines and emergency reserves to limit the possibility of load shedding. “We will keep our customers informed if there are any changes to the system,” said Eskom. On Monday, employees of Optimum Coal Mine protested against their employer, demanding payment. It is reported that workers did not receive their salaries for the month of November. The workers blocked the road leading to Hendrina Power Station and the entrance to the Optimum Coal Mine. Hendrina is one of the 10 power stations with less than 20 days of coal stockpiles in its coal stockyard. Any long disruptions could have a serious impact on the power station. “We encourage residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly to ease the demand for electricity,” said Eskom on its website. The company advised people to keep checking load shedding schedules on Eskom or municipal websites and to plan accordingly.
