A BRAIN clot changed Ntombikayise Sokhela’s life in an instant. The 21-year-old from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni said an incident at school when she was 12 years old set it all off. She told Daily Sun it had been a normal school day until she was pushed by another pupil and fell down 18 flights of stairs in the school building. At first she thought nothing was wrong except for a few bruises. But two days after the incident, she started having a problem being in the light. “I would stay in the dark, but on the third day I collapsed. “I was taken to the hospital where I stayed for a week.” Ntombikayis said doctors discvoerd she had had a thrombosis. “This is when a stroke occurs and the blood clot forms in one of the arteries to the brain. “I couldn’t walk and had to use a wheelchair for five years. But through faith, belief and a number of sessions with physiotherapists, I was able to walk again.” Ntombikayise said after the incident, her fingers were unable to function. “I would forget people’s names easily and I gained weight. This affected my lifestyle since I couldn’t run around like other teenagers.” But Ntombikayise said she never gave up. She was moved to Esibeleni LSEN school to do her grade 8 and 9. “Now I’m with I Can, a school in Parktown that accommodates people with disabilities, where I’m doing business administration.” Ntombikayise is also a teacher at Ayanda Preschool in Vosloorus. “I’m responsible for basic learning skills. I make sure there is order and the kids are safe,” she said. Ntombikayise said her tragedy inspired her love of teaching.
