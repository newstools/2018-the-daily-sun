MPUMELELO Mkwanazi (32) keeps telling Home Affairs he is not dead but they don’t believe him. Mpumelelo, from Meadowlands in Soweto, said he lost his ID in 2013 but when he tried to apply for a new one, Home Affairs told him he was dead. “I don’t know what to do to get Home Affairs to help,” said Mpumelelo. He said when they scan his fingerprints, four unknown men appear. “None of these guys are from South Africa.” Mpumelelo told Daily Sun he lost a job he’d had for seven years because of this. “I understand why they terminated my contract. They can’t keep paying a dead person,” he said. He said his employer told him he could come back to work after fixing his ID problem. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said: “The matter has been referred to the Gauteng Home Affairs manager to institute an investigation. We will contact the client to get more information.”
