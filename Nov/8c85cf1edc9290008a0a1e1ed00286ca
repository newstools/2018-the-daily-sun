VILLAGERS were dealt a heavy blow on Wednesday evening when heavy storms damaged their houses. The storms in Malamulele, Limpopo, claimed the lives of gogo Modjadji Sithole (100) from Bevula and Cloudine Chauke (47) from Makuleke Village. More than 200 houses were left without roofs and trees and electric poles fell over. When the storm had passed, the area looked like it had been hit by a tornado. Samson Baloyi of Makuleke said it started at 6pm on Wednesday. “We were inside when a very strong wind hit and shook our houses. In a short space of time, roofs were gone and we had to squeeze ourselves in one room and wait until the storm was over,” he said. Samson said all their belongings were wet and many residents suffered heavy losses. He said there had never been such a strong storm in the area before. “We are now busy trying to pick up the pieces and repair our roofs. “We are just hopeful the municipality will help us, as we were left with nothing,” he said. Vhembe District Municipality spokesman Matodzi Ralushai confirmed the damage was caused by heavy storms. “Our disaster management team is in the field assessing the damage. A joint operation team involving different stakeholders has been activated and a meeting is to be held today at the Malamulele Civic Centre, where we are going to chart the way forward,” he said. “For now we will be able to provide 20 tents and 200 food parcels for those affected in Makuleke, Makahlule and Hlungwani villages.”
