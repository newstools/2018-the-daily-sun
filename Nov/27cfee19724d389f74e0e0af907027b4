THE DA has returned to court in a bid to make Jacob Zuma pay back the taxpayer-funded legal fees he racked up while in office as president. The EFF has since joined the DA in its legal action against Zuma, but the EFF is now also targeting Msholozi’s former attorney, Michael Hulley. It said Hulley, who has been Zuma’s main representative over the last decade, should pay back the money he was paid by Zuma as well. The EFF, by its calculations, said Zuma must pay back R32 million! The Gauteng North High Court in Tshwane has set aside two days to hear the DA’s challenge to government’s decision to pay Zuma’s legal fees. The outcome of the DA’s application is set to determine whether the South African taxpayer will continue to pay the bill for Zuma’s legal costs, which are estimated to be about R15 million. The court will resume proceedings today.
