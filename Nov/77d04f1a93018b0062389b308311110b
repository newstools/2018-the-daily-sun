LESBIAN, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people have to deal with being treated unfairly and often feel they can’t live freely. That’s why the Red Cross organised an event in Marapong in Lephalale, Limpopo, on Wednesday to educate villagers about them and about sex workers. Over 200 people attended. Red Cross co-ordinator Dolph Raditoro said they realised most villagers didn’t accept them. “They’re not taken seriously. Most of them are not able to find work and are harassed wherever they go. “Even in town, shoppers look at them as if they’re clowns. “Some are also mocked by police when they report cases.” Dolph said he realised pupils were also being teased at school. “They’re mocked because of the way they dress, walk, speak and behave,” he said. “We’re going to speak to the education department so this community is included in their policy for schools.” Speaking on behalf of sex workers, Jane Kgole said they were also being harassed, especially by police. Resident Thabang Moetsi (27) said she learnt a lot. “The event opened my eyes and I’ve accepted these people,” Thabang told the People’s Paper.
