WHEN she started training as a body builder, Casey Danca imagined herself representing her country. The 20-year-old had no idea that her dream would come true so soon. On Wednesday she jetted off to Spain to represent Mzansi in the International Federation of Bodybuilding world championships in the junior bikini fitness category. The social work graduate from Walter Sisulu University said after she grew up watching the sport dominated by men, she finally joined up in 2016 and has not looked back since. “Bodybuilding is not only about having a bulky body and bulging muscles but also about a healthy lifestyle.” In August she took top spot in the OR Tambo bodybuilding competition. This paved the way for her at the national bodybuilding competition in September, where she was chosen to represent Mzansi. Casey was determined to do everything in her power to fly the South African flag high. She leads a healthy lifestyle and wants other women to follow her example. “It’s what we are supposed to do to keep ourselves healthy and strong,” she said. Casey advised women to not be afraid to lift weights or go the extra mile at gym out of fear of looking like men. “It’s all about personality,” she said.
