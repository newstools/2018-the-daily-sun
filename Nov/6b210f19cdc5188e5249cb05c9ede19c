That’s how I feel with an incredible team to support me, fun choreography to execute, wardrobe malfunctions (lol), a versatile playlist, a stage, an audience, creative freedom, a purpose to fulfill and a dream to live. Thank you @axe for making me the first lady of Axe! For supporting and respecting me and my team, Team Bontle. Thank you for giving me the creative freedom to take the show where I needed it to be. For allowing the magic to unfold. But I never would have had a show to begin with had it not been for an exemplary, magical, amazing bunch of talented, passionate individuals who created a team I will never forget. For most, this was their biggest show, on the biggest. A first, and it’s my absolute pleasure to have introduced them to that world. These are people who changed my life, in as much as I impacted theirs. I can never thank you enough!!! I love you all Team Bontle. And I assure you that the dream lives on, strong and hard. Here’s to our next show together! ???????????
