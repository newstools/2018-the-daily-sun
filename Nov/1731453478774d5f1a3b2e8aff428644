THE annual Discovery Walter Sisulu Soccer Challenge is back with the 16th edition of the tournament set to take place at the Nike Training Centre in the heart of Soweto, Klipspruit. The Soweto Football Association (SFA), along with the Walter Sisulu Foundation, will again ensure that Kasi football takes centre stage from 1-29 December where over 100 teams will battle it out for the big cash prizes up for grabs. The tournament gives young talent the much needed platform to showcase their skills and the opportunity to be discovered by reputable scouts. It also provides entertainment during the festive season for the scores of football fanatics from across Soweto and surrounding areas who come to watch some of the brightest young talent on display. The tournament has helped launch the careers of some of the country’s finest footballers in the likes of Bafana Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo, Orlando Pirates striker Lyle Foster and Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Sibusiso Vilakazi to name a few. Vilakazi and Foster, who were in attendance at the launch of this year’s tournament in Sandton, on Tuesday said it played a huge role in their development as football players. Said Vilakazi: “It’s the perfect platform for any young player because it has been a great success for many years. We have seen it produce a lot of quality players who have gone on to do big things. “We hope we can get many more excellent players that can be able to influence our football going forward.” Foster, who is set to join Ligue 1 giants Monaco in January, is the most recent breakout star from the tournament and said it held a special place in his heart.
