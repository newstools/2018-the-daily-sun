CAPE TOWN Metro cops have warned residents and visitors against carrying or drinking booze at beaches. Over the weekend, cops who patrolled the beaches in Clifton, Camps Bay and Maidens Cove confiscated booze and illegal goods being sold by traders. Inspector Vuyani Aplom said 167 bottles of booze were confiscated at the three spots. He said 12 fines of R500 each were issued. “Officers on foot patrol in these areas confiscated 33 hats, 19 baseball caps and 16 sunglasses from illegal traders. “Some of these illegal traders have in the past been found to be selling alcohol among their other goods, so officers are cracking down on those who don’t follow procedure in terms of the City’s informal trading rules,” said Aplom. He said cops also bust a suspect with a remote jammer used to break into vehicles. In December, cops confiscated a total of 4 314 bottles of alcohol. Volunteer lifeguard Xoliswa Plaatjie, who usually works at Monwabisi beach near Khayelitsha, said the beaches were starting to get busy. “We remain on our feet when December comes as the number of people at the beaches increases. “People get excited about the festive season and end up doing dangerous things. But we’re ready to face the challenge. I’ve been doing this for the past eight years.”
