A FAMILY in Nelson Mandela Bay is fuming over an overflowing manhole that is spewing sewage into their house.Whenever they step into the kitchen to cook a meal, they have to tiptoe on a slippery floor flooded with kak water.Zukiswa Kula (44) said: “We have had to deal with chunks of raw sewage for the past 18 years. Every time the manhole overflows, the kak comes straight to my house.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvoocEJVChmupWHKshq3ZmkpKiLXMuFysrOW1icLdSuuu4me9aW3sc9n4BA8ilA3lOSQLl5oZRO5PMSxLqLo5akx8cNZ0IOvytrUqdPIHhRzNLWoXzy3scZbP0ZsR-2PQvA0eW_UOLzCSqkgpbMy4_WyiBknqjEY3JjglTMB5r9415KlS7IzgB06Mp45A53uWsxWf-6GbMk_lZjDkvF8rw119lTOudY76cpNn5qLZSvIS5dxAl7kXbjcMR-lMliqAWJEgimuxt_5s9ATH5uXAkyFFQtIao\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGYbWkIfV0sNEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Our furniture is ruined. I’ve had to replace my kitchen cupboard and replace the wardrobe.“My house has become a complete health hazard with faeces and toilet paper floating in the sewage. I need a solution immediately because I cannot live like this anymore.”As recently as Friday, Zukiswa said she pleaded with the municipality to fix the problems. Nelson Mandela Bay spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “If the facts are correct and the matter was reported for years, it is shocking that people have had to live under such conditions. The municipality would like to apologise for such humiliation. A team will urgently attend to the matter and ensure a lasting solution.”
