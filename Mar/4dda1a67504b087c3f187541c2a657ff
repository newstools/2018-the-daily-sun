infamous Sun City wedding in 2013. He was appointed as an editor at the then
unknown Infinity Media Networks – ANN7's official name.But on a Sunday morning only a few weeks later, he found himself
briefing then president Jacob Zuma on the virtues and value propositions of the
next big thing in media: Africa News Network 7.A name, which according to Sundaram, was chosen by Jacob Zuma himself.This is one of several staggering revelations made in the book. In it,
Sundaram lifts the sordid lid of how the Guptas' news channel came into
existence through the hands of a conflicted midwife: Zuma himself.During a meeting on June 22, 2013, oldest brother Ajay Gupta told
Sundaram that Zuma had suggested the name "Africa News Network" for
the TV channel."The name was already taken, so we decided to call it 'Africa News
Network 7'. We must make the president feel important and tell him that we are
taking suggestions given by him seriously. He will like it if we seek
suggestions from him on how to run the news channel. He would like to see us as
his own channel."Zuma would later tell the brothers to keep the influence subtle, and not
have the channel devolve into a publicity channel for him and the ANC.Zuma did not respond to questions sent to him by the publishers of the
book.The level of familiarity between the Guptas and Zuma is prevalent
throughout the book. Sundaram says it was clear that the Guptas knew Zuma
intimately. "We call him Baba", Atul Gupta told Sundaram. "We
call the Rashtrapati 'Baba'. That is what people who know him call him."Rashtrapati is the Hindi word for "president".Zuma picked ManyiZuma's hand in the affairs of ANN7 allegedly went as far as suggesting
employees for the Guptas' consideration. During a meeting in July 2013, Zuma
suggested that then government spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi should be considered
as a talk show host on ANN7. "He will be most suited for your talk shows. If you want, I will
speak with him as well," Zuma is quoted as telling the Guptas. "I am
sure there are many presenters available. Just do let me know if there is any
high profile journalist you may have selected."But Manyi was less than impressive during his interview. "Jimmy
failed miserably when he did his test interrogation with Atul on the Waterkloof
issue. Nazeem [Howa, senior Gupta executive], the top editorial team, me and
Atul himself knew he was stiff on camera and reluctant to ask tough questions."But Howa still insisted that Manyi be hired."We have to hire him; President Zuma will have it no other way. But
we do not have to put him on air until he is perfect. We will have someone
train him," Howa is quoted saying.Zuma's role in setting up ANN7 went much further than random advice,
according to Sundaram. At various meetings he gave detailed input into how the
channel should be managed, including approving the ANN7 logo.Zuma cautioned about making it look like a propaganda channel. "I
have a few suggestions," he was quoted saying at one of the meetings.
"We must not convert this into a publicity channel for the ANC and me. If
we do that, we will have no credibility. You must present the views of the
opposition and my rivals in the ANC as well."The push in our favour should be subtle. You are a seasoned
journalist. You know how that can be done… eNCA only presents the government
and me negatively. We need a channel that presents the positives that the
government is doing," Zuma said looking at Sundaram."I will be in Mpumalanga next week, and I will meet people in the
local communities and announce measures for their welfare. But I am sure eNCA
will not cover that. Their reporter will seek out opposition supporters and do
a negative story on how the locals hate me and feel I have done nothing for
them," Zuma is quoted saying.SOURCE: NEWS24
