She said their neighbour and her friend tried to hit her with a kettle, spade, brick and steel rod. Debra confronted the women. “My neighbour said my daughter spilled dirty water in her yard. Before I could apologise they insulted me!” And as she was walking into her shack,she says a brick hit her on the back. “When I turned around my neighbour was shouting, ‘Resign bi**h, resign, you cannot work at the same place as my boyfriend.’ We went to the police station,” she said. But cops only warned the women. “I was disappointed. I wanted them arrested,” she said. One of the other women said the fighting was sparked by Debra, who stood up for her daughter. “Her child did me wrong and I lost my temper. I regret it now,” she said. Silverton police spokesman Captain Jan Sepato said the officers were wrong not to open a case.“They should see the station commander,” he said.
