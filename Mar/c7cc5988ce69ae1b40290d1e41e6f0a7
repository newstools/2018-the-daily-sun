I’ve been going to the Home Affairs offices and all they tell me is that my birth certificate is invalid,” he said.Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the matter had been referred to the provincial Home Affairs manager who will instruct officials to investigate.He said Home Affairs would contact Sarel soon and invite him to the nearest office to resolve the issue.
