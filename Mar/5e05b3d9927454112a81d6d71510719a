STELLENBOSCH FC coach Steve Barker says being eliminated from the Nedbank Cup is a blessing in disguise, as their priority is to qualify for the promotion play-offs.His side lost 2-1 to Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs in the Last 16 round of the Ke Yona Cup at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. After their defeat to Amakhosi  Barker described their participation in Ke Yona as a “dinner date you go on once a month”. He says he knew that playing Chiefs in front of over 15 000 supporters would be a big task for his National First Division (NFD) side.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstI-MMts_Gl0_yZu1HfNtqf78TTj5s1ghVU57aSQBPkf8hF281Jwd4G-2xG-rrMb2GYB_QKMR_tW6B_BgBvBJcIf7QIequa2-2-flpoAvTUfoI2e_bkaceI79Jg7wV5LQMZ_Ll5JEp5VzRKmhlgjCY4gYPVznXZrTn_z_kB8u0S8uUB50P9HBSjdnMIhu8Hu9V24k2hIhUMebTvk-DQWJYdLKMJnjHlxLqxUXL-Zxq8C2Uj_JK9qcWS8soqyPShqswoBo22VrOhdAzDut62\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGPvnSI62X7eEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Playing Chiefs is like going out to dinner, you dress up smartly and enjoy it. But our bread and butter is the league. “I was hoping to have a couple more, but unfortunately there are no more of those dinners for us.”Stellenbosch would feel they’ve accomplished a lot in this match compared to their last meeting with Chiefs. Amakhosi defeated the Capetonians 3-0 in Ke Yona’s Last 32 round in Cape Town last season.Barker said their focus now was to make sure they fight for every single point on offer in their last seven NFD matches. His charges face Cape Town All Stars next in a Cape derby at Athlone Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm). Stellenbosch are currently in ninth place with 30 points, six points shy of a promotion play-offs spot.“The important thing now is to finish the season strongly. We have seven matches to play and I have a team that plays very good football. It’s just that we lack the ability to finish off games, especially in the league. “We dominate phases of play and just lack the ability to get that important goal. But I have gained confidence from playing Chiefs, there are lots of positives I will take on board ahead of our next league match,” concluded Barker.
