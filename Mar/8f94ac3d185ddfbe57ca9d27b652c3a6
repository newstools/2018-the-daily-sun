National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams has been "invited" to Parliament to explain why the National Prosecuting Authority dragged its feet in giving the Hawks the go-ahead to make arrests in the Estina/Vrede dairy farm state capture case.Parliament has also called acting Hawks head Lieutenant General Yolisa Matakata to appear before a joint sitting of two portfolio committees.This after Matakata told the portfolio committee on police on Wednesday that the NPA did not "hinder the investigation [into state capture], but they were hindering the progress of taking the matter to court".if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst9-EaFAoF62cc2sufjG5cxGJRl2_xxlBxFcbpn2yLKIKWl1buNje6TGeBsobzEc2MZrSkUK0B88zX9959rxe4yqHeA9jtn6cpvqg8YLXUecOSLCCSfSw7u4uxtR8SvXXgn3XUEPSOJE8gCTWVSqDzzRO7-yt_myc6fo8eZmpgPa_adIgOE3DlRX-w2ifFcJDfAFZg5wm86YTwtK5t1RI6zf1XX2Ca6qha8sov635mK1CWswouUgePHHsfNkNt4WB4K1nltZq0gRKCWSB-2BZKwaDZKQqo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGyt1ZxUfIJGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The NPA will have to explain why there was such a long delay," he said.Beukman said this meeting will be important to understand the obstacles affecting the Hawks' ability to execute its mandate."The efforts of the Hawks to fight organised crime should not be hampered by slow decision-making. Prosecution-driven cases dealing with state capture and court-ready dockets should be prioritised. We are looking forward working with Dr Motshekga and the justice committee so that progress is made in this very important matter," said Beukman.In 2013, the Free State's department of agriculture, then with Mosebenzi Zwane as MEC, gave the Gupta-linked company Estina a 99-year lease on a dairy farm with R220m for an empowerment project.The Asset Forfeiture Unit would later describe this transaction as a "scheme designed to defraud and steal monies from the department".https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/hawks-matakata-and-npas-abrahams-to-face-off-in-parliament-over-guptas-20180302
