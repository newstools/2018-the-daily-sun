The older one, who is 21 years old, dropped out of school last year to help bring up her siblings after their mother died.She added that there were nine members in total in the family as she also had four of her own children. They survive on the child support grants of her two grandchildren.“They don’t have full school uniforms. It’s difficult to put food on the table. “I’m begging the department of social development to assist. Three months is too long,” she cried.Sassa provincial spokeswoman Sandy Godlwana said it was their responsibility to investigate whenever irregularities had occurred. “The system showed that one of the children’s fingerprint was a duplicate of the other, so their grants were suspended and an investigation was launched.” But she added that the agency was in the process of approving the application.“This process may take up to two months.” She advised Sindiswa to visit social workers to apply for Social Relief of Distress, food parcels and school uniforms in the meantime.
