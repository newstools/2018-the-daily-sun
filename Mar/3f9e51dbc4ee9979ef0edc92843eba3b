I want a woman who will love me and not my money,” he said.Albert said he was a kind and loving man, but the women he met didn’t appreciate him.“I even tried dating married women to ease the pain of being by myself, but that didn’t work. I ended up falling in love with them.”He said time wasn’t on his side.“I want to get married again and put my money to good use. Getting old scares me. I might die before getting a woman. I want someone who is going to respect, love and take care of me,” he said.He said the woman he is looking for must also come from a sad background like him.“Preferably a widow or a divorced woman,” said Albert.Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said it could be that the women don’t get aroused or feel excited when they are with him in bed.“He must find a sangoma to perform a ritual on him to get rid of the bad luck,” she said.
