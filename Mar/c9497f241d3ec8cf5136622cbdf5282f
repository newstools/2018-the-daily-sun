TUBERCULOSIS is one of Mzansi’s major health problems.That is why the international emergency medical operators, Doctors Without Borders, used World Tuberculosis Day ast weekend to mark five key strategies to help end the deadly epidemic.TB can be cured, but the challenges to diagnosis and care mean the disease kills a person every 18 seconds.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The five top TB challenges1. Stigma makes the epidemic worse. About one in three people living with TB do not disclose their status outside of the household.“We need education so that people stop gossiping and discriminating against TB patients,” said Nonjabulo Madida from Ngwelezana, KZN, who was cured of drug-resistant TB last year.2. Undiagnosed TB cases are a serious issue. If left untreated, TB will keep spreading. An estimated one in four South Africans living with the disease are never diagnosed.Preventing TB transmission needs better screening strategies in our communities.3. People with DR-TB shouldn’t have to choose between their lives and their treatment – people should be offered new drugs from the start of treatment.Standard treatment includes a painful daily injection of kanamycin that causes hearing loss in up to 60% of those who take it.New treatments such as bedaquiline and delamanid exist and should be made available to those who need them.4. People have to cope with the lengthy and challenging treatment for TB without patient support.Drugs should be taken for six months for drug-sensitive (DS-TB), and nine to 24 months for DR-TB. DR-TB medicines, in particular, have side-effects that make it difficult to lead a normal life.Funding is needed to ensure a comprehensive counselling support package for TB sufferers.5. The slow pace of decentralising care for DR-TB keeps patients at overcrowded district hospitals for treatment.The department of health’s policies needs to move DR-TB care to other healthcare facilities in order to improve access to treatment for people and lower costs to the health system. Unfortunately, implementation is inconsistent across provinces.EARLY DR-TB DETECTIONIT IS not right that tuberculosis is still the infectious disease with the highest death toll in Mzansi.Dr
 Thandi Dlamini-Miti, a DR-TB technical adviser at Right to Care, says 
there is a rising number of TB patients presenting with drug-resistant 
TB (DR-TB).“This means they were infected with DR-TB and need to take more drugs and for nine to 24 months.“Side effects are more common and severe. This places a serious burden on patients, families and the state.”Right
 to Care is working with the department of health to increase the early 
diagnosis of TB, detect resistance, address treatment barriers, improve 
patient treatment discipline and improve infection control.“This 
involves simple actions like sneezing or coughing into the elbow or a 
tissue and keeping windows open at home, public transport and health 
facilities.“In South Africa, TB contributes to about 25% of 
HIV-related deaths. It is estimated that around 70% of new adult cases 
of tuberculosis are co-infected with HIV. “People who have any 
symptom of TB should get tested at their nearest public health facility.
 The earlier they can start TB treatment the more they reduce its spread
 among others,” Dlamini-Miti said.
