Centlec, the company that supplies Mangaung Municipality with electricity, disconnected his power on Tuesday after it turned out the meter box had been tampered with.Mahlomola said electricity was always available for him and his tenants until Centlec workers came to his house on Tuesday.“They told me I had used electricity, costing R34 245,53 and then took the meter box. “I had nothing to do with the tampering.” Shop owner Thabo Mohammed denied stealing electricity. “I always bought R100 electricity every three days when I rented at his yard. We moved out after his power was cut off,” said Thabo.Mahlomola said he would open a case against Thabo.
