Her mum Nosive said other villagers did look in the same toilet three times but saw nothing. “I went to the school after 1pm to look for her and found her lunch box untouched in her classroom,” she told Daily Sun. “We looked for her the whole night and even slept at the school, hoping she had got on the wrong bakkie home and would be back in the morning. “If only someone had been watching over her, she would still be alive. “We found out from the transport driver that she was missing.” Nosive said this was a sign that the school doesn’t care.
