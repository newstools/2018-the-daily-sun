The MEC refuted the claims and said she personally paid for the operation. When asked for proof of payment to disprove the claims, her spokeswoman, Emelda Setlhako, said due to doctor-patient confidentiality she didn’t think the MEC could give her proof to the media. Tlhape confirmed to Daily Sun that the surgery had been done. “But it was from my own pocket back in 2014 when I was still MEC for local government.“These are just malicious reports and personal attacks,” she said.A Facebook user had alleged that Tlhape instructed a company called Agri Delight, which was contracted to the department of agriculture in the province, to buy her a fast food franchise.The company allegedly paid R1,1 million for a Roman’s Pizza franchise in Mahikeng. The user added that this was the same company that paid for her nose job. Attempts to get comment from Agri Delight were unsuccessful as their phone went unanswered. They also didn’t respond to emails. Roman’s Pizza CEO John Nicolakakis dismissed the Facebook post as false. Tlhape also denied it. “These allegations are baseless, unfortunate and misleading,” she said.
