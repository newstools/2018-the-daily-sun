The Free State High Court in Bloemfontein has ruled in
favour of controversial Gupta brother Atul in his application to have a
preservation order, obtained against him by the NPA's Asset Forfeiture Unit
(AFU), set aside.Judge Fouche Jordaan has ruled that the R10m in Gupta's
accounts be unfrozen. He however amended his previous order pertaining to Gupta
linked companies and Bank of Baroda. About R40m in the Bank of Baroda,
belonging to Gupta related companies remains preserved. The AFU had wanted
R220m preserved. The bank and the companies were listed as applicants in the
case.Gupta claimed that the AFU had misled the court with the
evidence they presented to secure the preservation order. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvIYRoXXsT2N16CU67p_kGjrntwvse0DC6cV55GIkpBmlDSsnH6NkKs1zZk1xVBjTbm7My9TLEG3FcNuON9FMBDwyMzhaWA3eTgGcB-g1a4H7QS7HG6YVX0IefA2Vo3F_l6QG3klAmftMnC1YwNbaAGDzKQ4tBvySnWn5rmE6PeSvzjJSyq1M0W6aq_DcPI7aPcuEFXo2ORvrEhYs2ma_umm6tfBQ-GNNdx12nD2epI8k56k9qNd58Wy5MGSKKTS9BgATht-STOwgdW9glKYH0jP3FQxT0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIQj_G0L8P-bEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Dubai. His affidavit was signed and sworn in Dubai and it was stamped and
signed by a commissioner of oaths at the South African consulate in there."I wish to state, at the outset, that I am currently
outside South Africa," he said.Gupta denied that he had unduly benefited from the Estina
dairy farm project, but added that he had not had an opportunity to read the
papers."The affidavit is prepared in extreme haste as I was
only able to give factual instructions on February 7," he said in his
papers.He also submitted that he did not take issue with the part
of the order which related to the preservation of immovable property. He
restricted his challenge to the cash amount.The NPA seized control of a dairy farm in the Free State, the
Guptas' bank accounts, companies co-owned by Duduzane Zuma, and other entities
in the Gupta empire.In an answering affidavit filed, prosecuting authorities set
out precisely why they say that R10m in Gupta's personal bank account
constituted the proceeds of corruption, fraud and money laundering.The AFU said the money was paid from the Estina dairy
project, which received it from the Department of Agriculture in the Free
State.Special director of public prosecutions Motlalekhotso Knorx
Molelle said in the affidavit, that evidence obtained by financial
investigators Samson Schalkwyk and Nkosiphendule Mradla revealed that there was
a series of alleged unlawful and criminal activities that led to the money
being paid.Molelle referred to a separate affidavit by Mradla, who said
that the Free State agriculture department paid the money to Estina as a result
of an unlawful contract.The money was then "mingled" with other money in
the account, which then constituted money laundering, Molelle submitted."A few days later an amount of [R4.5m] was withdrawn
and/or transferred from this account to [Oakbay Investments] therefore
constitute proceeds of unlawful activities."Molelle said Mradla's affidavit was supported by bank
statements which clearly identified Oakbay Investments as a recipient of
proceeds of "corruption, fraud, theft and money laundering committed
against the Free State Department of Agriculture"."The fourth applicant [Oakbay Investments] received
proceeds of unlawful activities as it has not rendered any services either to
the Free State Department of Agriculture and to Estina."He said Gupta was one of the recipients and a beneficiary.SOURCE: NEWS24
