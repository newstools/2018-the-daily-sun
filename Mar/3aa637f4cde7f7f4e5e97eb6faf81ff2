TSHEPO Tema is on the verge of joining Free State Stars after a frustrating time  at Polokwane City. Stars coach Luc Eymael has shown interest in the tough defender, while relegation-haunted Ajax Cape Town are also trying to lure him to the Mother City. But indications are that he will reunite with the Belgian coach who guided him at Polokwane last season. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstABNLsrD4VMtVz4oorEFvkuQyTYLodXnxemCN5Ogosk3YslYCMTArUp7d_cnrWUzLcmhzVCgFq1UlN5fCKv01fDFNAuao4cGPYBGOY2sG5acg2DT-0saZjjNPslbp9PWgSIajQJAYqPmtv8IODZ-e0ORQMCd3D5nJy1s9rfhWiylW7IploCBjnVCp9myWDCEW_SPltwJ8aMJANczlJaBnhVER-9wUO7ea6A_W0gJ7nxZ9_pRiQ91YGf_umPpvBbC23F974odm0uJvjs1tBhikQmA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNuU2J-U2IDuEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The move failed to materialise and cost him a place in Rise and Shine’s first team, as he was not registered with the PSL. As if that was not enough, Tema was demoted to train with the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) side for the remainder of the season. Said Tema: “I had a tough time considering I only played friendlies for the MDC side. I lack match fitness since I’ve hardly played, except at training. This affected me but I had to be strong. It was hard but I kept my focus and never gave up. At least I get a salary, I can pay my bills.”Tema is happier now and feels he can finally see light at the end of the tunnel: “I could have taken my career to another level had they allowed me to leave. But I knew my situation wasn’t permanent. "I have two months left before my contract expires and that keeps me motivated when I wake up every morning. I put God first because he will open doors for me.”At 29, Tema knows that he will need to make a wise move to secure his future –he is not getting any younger.“I have had a good working relationship with coach Eymael. I learnt a lot from him when he was in charge at Polokwane. Ajax might be struggling at the moment but they are a good team too. I will decide within the next month or so where I will go,” concluded Tema.
