This week's Date My Family bachelor left viewers in stitches. When the popular Mzansi Magic show started, some viewers took to Twitter saying it was going to be a boring episode because the bachelor, who introduced himself as Khethani, seemed so slow as first.But he soon hailed as the "God of clapbacks" and "King of shade" the way he handled questions from members of the three families, especially those who were being rude at him.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuWJhrzYDp3B_vlhJimsy_JUcOoxMw8BC1-7kNVdrbWCvAuxcd2Jog8bEIcRBBg6QC_pLAZvk0QZEo9n-2dyOHjftnrpdL6WtfJSjCdwbEJ1o6jK7hicK8nMbozzC1K0QN0e3JRmHFdBbhQpRl5EMaH7nuP97WDgmemY9DDJCJN9KAYhqD6ykA4ROIRjN3QGImAVRlond4xk8irTYqNWgr4COvWpRCsokrUwjosldFAyNo2HrNxBKyhg7gvEHBX1J_HfZmrl5O4Z9mjRC1iw1uIO-m0QERv56ogmw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMuVTjw5njyIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He allows people to talk and eventually hang themselves with their own rope. He also seems to know how to push buttons in retaliation for the shocking behaviour he's being subjected to.— Phumeza Joelle (@PhumiJoelle) March 18, 2018Khethani is a low key savage.???? #DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/0jd5BQvHjU— Mduduzi Dlamini (@Tranquilitized) March 18, 2018#datemyfamilyThis guy bombing everyoneGayWhore HookerIncapable absent mom pic.twitter.com/fI54fOWkOY— iSambane (@_uKwenama) March 18, 2018If you throw punches to khehane he throw back badly #DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/eJtyb5pUPs— Scelo Kingscelo (@kingscelo_05) March 18, 2018Khathani just roasted those two .
