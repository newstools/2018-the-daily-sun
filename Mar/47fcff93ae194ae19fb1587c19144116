This week's Date My Family bachelor left viewers in stitches. When the popular Mzansi Magic show started, some viewers took to Twitter saying it was going to be a boring episode because the bachelor, who introduced himself as Khethani, seemed so slow as first.But he soon hailed as the "God of clapbacks" and "King of shade" the way he handled questions from members of the three families, especially those who were being rude at him.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstYJHfSqjEQE9i8eR5yinT9WU00IObCPv83QeiydYhEtU56gire1Qlb9ZNrzayRqHJH89b42UNGhl6wP5Yf-nB3aplFViMp-IO39QzmOiD7pwtwoGRvG4Md7Ey8Li9JFkCRKbOIVY0Q5CHWn066s3D38YrMPC5qSFmX6xsesCw4JxPgKgI4NkEXAGIK5Qvqo1hdMGbAKmSYRaWjY_71avCTqofjEPWo-0__npilQZ8XpXsgRaGgBiuJ6lVyhl2-Q5jCvuYfq31fEF94jwqtBRswgRsCCyt61KCF0Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAgF2sDwievHEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
