invasions would not be tolerated.“We should not tolerate disorder and lawlessness of that
type,” he said.“Nobody has any right to invade land, to violate other
people’s rights.”Ramaphosa also warned that “all those who want to invade
land, they will get to know that we will not allow that.”The debate on land has been on everyone’s lips since
Ramaphosa announced in Parliament that the ANC is moving to change the
constitution to allow land expropriation without compensation to take place.However, many have feared that this could spark civil
unrest.Gauteng Premier David Makhura is quoted as saying that the
land grabbing appeared to be an organized invasion.
