Joseph Mogwase, chairman of the SGB who first alerted Daily Sun to the problems, said he was happy but needed to see everything that was promised.Once the second phase is complete, the school will have a laboratory, library, administration block and a water system. Thabo Moyo from Anglo American expressed his joy that the mine was part of the development. The chairman of Dikuno, Mosimagape Moleme, said they were aware the school was not complete due to finances but promised the remaining phase would be completed.Shadrack Mvula, representing the MEC for education Sello Lehari, said the kids’ matric pass rate improved from 47% in 2015 to 77% when they heard about the new school last year.“I hope we will go to 100% this year,” he said.Kobedi Pilane from the Bakgatla Ba Kgafela Tribal Council thanked all partners for working together to get the new school that he hoped would last for many years.
