THE Economic Freedom Fighters is calling on all its
supporters to help shop remove products linked to listeriosis.In a statement the EFF calls on "all fighters and
all fellow South Africans to visit nearby outlets of Pick n Pay to help them
remove all products that have been declared to spread listeriosis from their
shelves. "These are the Enterprise Foods and Rainbow Chicken products,
including polony, viennas and frankfurters (a.k.a russians) amongst others. "It is a matter of fact that Pick n Pay, due to its
arrogance and refusal to take responsibility, is failing to act on this with
the necessary speed required to save lives," said spokesperson Mbuyiseni
Ndlozi. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstlaVUdzgl1e7ugfBl1RSv_AHue3j_mHuzCV504msTDcskz7tL8JMO4v_3WVjzkZf2QI-IZRypenrfRsffUqiPHNSk3NWPVnHbtTj6fYmDjBmrIRwRvqLhpC54wDc7y2mcmHiS_zyD9-DgVKJhg6q2Nid0Lzn7Gf2LzJ8y2qdWAwr4YshDXf9z7wImImMn6z13ojArsUiKGW8vAIoGRqMMSPo9yxzGsqDw60xo8I1vfE3lgp1yvIESJhKVDJC081Y2dyRKycbUwyRiEVc0-TcT3l4v4NfY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGL3YDy3Ek1yEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

like Shoprite, Woolworths and others. "Fighters across the country, together with all
South Africans, must help managers and staff of these retail stores to remove
listeriosis products from our shelves."The South African outbreak of Listeriosis has been
confirmed by the World Health Organisation as the largest incident of
listeriosis in history, killing 180 lives, with 980 falling sick. "If the government and all related companies will
not declare a state of crisis; we must as citizens take it upon ourselves to do
so. Thus, the EFF declares the listeriosis outbreak as a crisis and call on all
citizens to embark on ensuring all products related to this outbreak are
removed from shelves across the country. 
No manager or staffer in any of the retail stores must stop citizens
from helping in the removal of these products." Ndlozi also called on Pick n Pay to refund all customers
returning their products, even without receipts. "It is very clear that no one would keep a receipt
if they did not intend on returning the product -  it is only noble to accept this to be the
case, and refund customers."
