reportedly bought the jet from a $41 million loan from Export Development
Canada. They are
reported to have defaulted on the loan. The bank,
in their court papers, has reportedly argued that there was “concern that the
aircraft may be used to escape justice or for some other unlawful means.”According
to News24, the jet, which is a Bombadier Global 6000 business aircraft, was
registered as ZS-OAK.The loan for
the purchase of the jet was issued by the Canadian bank (EDC).There have
been some reports that the Guptas have fallen behind in their scheduled
repayments on the loan from EDC that financed the jet in December last year.The plane flew from Dubai to Zurich on December 13, where it remained for six days, before undertaking a 36-minute journey to EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg in Switzerland.There the plane stayed put for more than a month, before taking to the skies again on January 25.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/canadian-banks-court-bid-to-ground-gupta-jet-postponed-20180306
