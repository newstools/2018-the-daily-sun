Former police minister Fikile Mbalula is the latest ANC
Member of Parliament to step down.Last week, former minister of public enterprises Lynne
Browne resigned. This followed a late-night Cabinet reshuffle announcement from
President Cyril Ramaphosa which resulted in the two - along with several others
- being booted out of the national executive.Mbalula has since taken up a full-time post at the ANC's
headquarters as chair of the party's subcommittee on elections. He has started
getting the governing party ready for the 2019 general elections by holding an
election workshop last week.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu4v22ycXhPp-yONGpo1HAtZVEk_h5m_gjG60pdRIgcGNpH96OSxuzlO6wc0sDaiufoID45AkMiGhvkoUdzx_lJASLqmu5L1alxGpFfqMI9lBTpipP9BOFC-3HaSEfsXyfM5PNr9su4_fcquP5BI9Fcqg8P88MXZzG9GJO4PQ187Od8qBIcpjDI76mc2MnB1thq5j06m0_4PEMP3Ffpa4nVH8q1Rb9rkEc2rNwCTVDNmIaK14X_RkSCc0HpI2nVCdua1Nu2EYW4f8e7S7rrbbwBCPAL434\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCEyYmE4nyjOEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
