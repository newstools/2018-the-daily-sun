Margaret said she heard a loud noise outside and when she went to investigate, she found people working on the electricity pole. “It was a group of men I didn’t know. I asked them to stop and then my neighbours told me not to get involved. We ended up having an argument,” said Margaret. She claimed this was when they threatened to kill her. “They said if I continued talking about the connection, they would end my life.”Constable Matsobane Mabusela said a case of intimidation was opened. “No one was arrested. We are still investigating.”
