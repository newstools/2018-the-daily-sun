<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>It allegedly happened after a cellphone went missing. Two boys claim to have been tied up and tortured by teachers who insisted they were responsible for the theft. The parents of one of the boys are demanding justice. The trouble at Makaula High School in KwaBhaca, Eastern Cape, started last Wednesday after the phone went missing and all pupils were searched. The phone was not found.The next day, a 14-year-old grade 8 pupil missed his bus and couldn’t get to school. According to the boy, three teachers then came to his house while his parents were at work and took him to school. They allegedly tied his hands behind his back in an empty classroom, made him bend over a chair and beat his buttocks with a pipe and a broomstick.The traumatised kid told Daily Sun: “They kept asking me what I’d done with the phone.“They took turns beating me until I said I gave it to a friend, which was a lie. “The teachers locked me in the room and went to fetch my friend in class. He was also beaten. After they’d tortured me, I was told to go back to class. I had to stand at first because it was too sore to sit.”The parents of the other pupil were too scared to come forward. But the other boy’s mother won’t take what happened to her son lying down. “Those men almost killed my child and I won’t let them get away with it. My daughter left school because of the abuse she was subjected to at Makaula. This time, I will not leave it.” The boy’s father said he was shocked by the brutal way his son had been treated. “What makes me most angry is that the teachers tied him up so he couldn’t defend himself.” This is not the first time staff at the school have been accused of abusing pupils. A video of a teacher beating pupils went viral last year. However, parents, pupils and the SGB denied the school used corporal punishment and no case was opened. Police spokeswoman Captain Edith Mjoko said a case of assault was opened at Mount Frere Police Station. “No arrests were made but investigations are continuing.” Provincial education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said they were aware of the incident.“Because of the nature of the case, it has been forwarded to the department’s rapid response for further investigation. The department seeks to charge those implicated in the case.”
