Controversial poet and musician Ntsiki Mazwai, who is known for unapologetically speaking her mind has this time turned her attention to comrades who went into exile during apartheid calling them cowards who do not deserve to be treated any better than the rest of us.Ntsiki lambasted the fact that comrades who went into exile get more struggle credentials and are celebrated more than those who actually stayed and faced the apartheid regime head on.The poet explained that people like her father Dr Thami Mazwai, should get more recognition for staying behind and fighting while others “ran away” into exile.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstkAMSigHPFxJ3FAluj-Ol0LhAOAODsq7xMh0pZwPO9fepP6akBOu6OHqnVqh-zS2pX_ImLht3PP60ZXTue5ye_6CPr7eHhibPs8lHFWMUWcuu72uzj1CK8wOvbbzZu_e4tQy4wkuV5v10ZkrCOIVyH6Ie70YSxXngFJ76D1T1T7XOPtjqQky7n65A0079E2bKwzv1RzhmNpKOBLiU1u71SfSPf8zVWgPZnKSmNGkqJufa-VBovB4HYBDqecVukNKARxsHwZ0VJFqIIjucvhZ8iMge-ESa8aceKmw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGOFNm8jSMz0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
