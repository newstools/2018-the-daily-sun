She said last year she buried the father of her children.She said she doesn’t know what she’s going to do and doesn’t have the means of burying her own children.Residents who were visiting the bereaved family, also raised concerns about the dangers of illegal electricity.They saying if the government can’t install electricity in their area, they must at least be taken where their lives will be bettered.Police spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza said an inquest case has been opened.
