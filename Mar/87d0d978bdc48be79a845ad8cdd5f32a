Voters are urged to take their IDs to the voting stations in their district. The IEC said the registration weekend came after two years of work to collect all voters’ addresses. The Constitutional Court ruled in 2016 that the IEC needed to update all voters’ information to include all available permanent addresses. Currently, only 11% of South Africa’s 25 899 778 registered voters have no registered addresses. Sy Mamabolo, the new IEC chief electoral officer, urged people who had never voted before to register. “The voters’ roll is a fundamental safeguard for free and fair elections,” he said. To support the voter registration weekend, Home Affairs said its offices will be open from 8am to 5pm this weekend so people could collect IDs and get temporary IDs. Those who are uncertain about their voting district should call the IEC on 0800 11 8000 or visit http://maps.elections.org.za/vsfinder/Registered voters can also SMS their ID number to 32810 for R1 to find out the address of their voting station, or check it on https://www.elections.org.za/MyIEC/
