The Gauteng Department of Education wishes to report that, it is investigating circumstances surrounding the incident of learner misconduct, circulating in the social media yesterday.  The Departmental came across a video footage in the social media, portraying a learner pelting what looks like an exercise book at the educator in a classroom.  Our preliminary investigation revealed that, the said incident occurred at Three Rivers Secondary School in Sedibeng. We immediately dispatched officials to investigate this incident accordingly. We can confirm that the officials from the Psycho Social Support Team have already started with the counselling process of all learners and educators this morning.   The department has also offered counselling to the affected educator through the Employee Wellness Program. The process to take the learner through a disciplinary hearing has commenced, and as such appropriate sanction will be recommended. “We urge all our learners to refrain from acts of misconduct in schools; and implore parents to assist the department in instilling learner discipline in and outside the school environment,” said MEC Lesufi.           For more information, contact the Gauteng Department of Education’s Spokesperson, Steve Mabona on 072 574 3860.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstJJoGTnyBsaTFdXat9FRaHO5V_y6ldDcKQe-OaYAFDEIFk1IH2sb2LyvJkmHqCpYZ8liTBWMlbUwwKvwRFQ3QbOurOUy5C2_HhqqGwvggkpaRTbISWP3vy6dsuvmLYVGSLdzkBs-WmespdHE6_1VlS9TaDGgF_xDUSr8PM2hcfe8e946qpP98dW5IW7sL-_XKARlYDoYmxmKXRBNQFb8bQX7dOiPFYbdfSDciknBu8S9ZZh6-3AmP-5utbDI6W-m8OD6WdnCAkd6SPGtn18ywSyfz_YWE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGD-BKMonxEfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
