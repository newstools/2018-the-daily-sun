testing station," the RTMC said.The arrests followed months of investigation in which the
four were observed issuing roadworthy certificates for vehicles that they were
not physically presented to the station for inspection.The RTMC says more than 60 people, including traffic
officers, SAPS members and vehicle examiners have been arrested in different
provinces on fraud and corruption charges since the start of the year.Investigations have  led
to the total shut-down of at least two privately owned testing stations.“The Department of Roads and Transport has given notice of
cancelation of registration to Hercules and Innovative testing centres. The owners of these centres were ordered to hand over the
certificates of registrations to the department and cease further operation,”
said the RTMC.
