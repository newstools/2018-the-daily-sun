THE Four Nations tournament serves a far greater purpose for Bafana Bafana’s development than the Cosafa Cup.Without disrespecting the annual Cosafa Cup, Bafana coach Stuart Baxter hailed the inaugural Four Nations and explained how his team could benefit more from it.South Africa achieved rare success when they claimed victory in the four-team tourney following a 2-0 win against hosts Zambia in the final at Levy Mwanawasa Stadium on Saturday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstNEUGSFL-JYN0ouQXkdxumVM7KVotocuAVFqz5bWJkYL14UZK6JKj6n_fV2cGOR5tBzwt98ahnIo1ho5MdyMSlGpn6FltWLisfEPFQzVaMeJGUlee4KnNV2gEHvFUtES2tZ-L4ZTfyKKwS0H2ixm4c_7Lt0OOCt6MBzh-yB8CBNZ0Kvu4arpmIrsXtx8ZsYAOEMBL_NswUdEXu-hHJ66xUj1zeZ7OpnghOpjNY0SHbya6XKpWuWZuN3NpwzVw5Pb84oH3iud2og7Y8YtdC\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDM57T3-qj7hEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It’s a known fact that coaches invariably use regional tournaments for development purposes to give inexperienced players a taste of international football.“With all due respect this is the ‘Cosafa Cup tournament’ that comes at a time when we absolutely can get our best team together,” said Baxter.“Going forward it will be a question of getting the best team we can, but using it as part of Cosafa and maybe getting the best players for the Olympics.We can support the youngsters with a couple of old hands.” The Scot lauded the Four Nations, which also featured Angola and Zimbabwe, emphasising its competitive nature.Midfielder Percy Tau scored in the first half while France-based young striker Lebo Mothiba netted the other goal, and his second of the tournament, with a sublime finish at the death.“This was much tougher test than Cosafa . . . a tight tournament. Every game has been tight. It was a good test. We can’t say because we won we were better than everybody else. That’s just not true. “And because of that it’s been a good test and we’ve enjoyed it. I’m delighted with the way the youngsters have performed.”Baxter kept his word and rang the changes for the cup decider, ensuring that all members of his squad got a run.The former Kaizer Chiefs coach has vowed to give the youngsters “more and more international experience”.Added Baxter: “When we were under a lot of pressure in the second half it would have been easy for me to take off Siphesihle (Ndlovu) and put on Dean Furman, take off Teboho Mokoena instead of Kamo (Mokotjo). “You can do that but the objective was to learn as much as we could about the players. It was a high pressure game for them.“When you are under pressure to win you pick your best team – and your best team is the one with all the experience. And when it goes wrong there are cries to bring in the kids, but when youngsters are not prepared they fail. “We have to try and widen the pool and we won’t do that unless we are prepared to take a chance on them.”Bafana arrived back home from Ndola yesterday.
