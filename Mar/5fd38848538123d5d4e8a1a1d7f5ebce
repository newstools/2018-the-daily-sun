Gamal had a promising start scoring two goals in the early season matches against Kaizer Chiefs and Golden Arrows. He also netted three times during the Telkom Knockout which was won by Wits late last year.Wits mentor Hunt confirmed that the player will be making a move to Finland. “Gamal is gone to Finland. It didn't work out, it is football,” Hunt told the media during the PSL monthly awards press conference.“Yeah, it is disappointing because I really thought he will do well for us and it didn't work out because various football reasons"“The mentality was okay, I just felt that there are certain things that the game requires in different countries and obviously is unfortunate that he got on the end and missed a lot of chances but that's happens in football"“There is not bad feelings, it happens in football"Gamal started the campaign well with the Students but things just changed. Hunt added: “He has never been out of his country. Any player when they come here the language is a biggest problem. Understanding the football what needs to be required foreign players do take a bit of time.“He was a good player I though he will settle in much quicker and it didn't happen. But you can see any where, foreign players do takes time.”
