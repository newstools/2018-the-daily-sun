He said he did all he could to make the department aware of the family dispute.“Family elders sent me to the department to give the MEC a letter pleading with them to stop the coronation but we are being ignored.” Charles has asked lawyers to take the matter forward and said he is the rightful heir to the Langa-Masibe chieftaincy, as he is from the senior family of their great-grandfather, Chief Masibe Madimetja Ramahlaswana Langa.“My brother knows this and it seems he is being forced or pushed to ascend to what he knows clearly is not his. I’m younger than Hans but am from the first family.” The chieftaincy stretches from Mokopane towards Lephalale and towards Bela-Bela.Department spokesman Paena Galane said Hans invited the MEC attend the ceremony and the department isn’t aware of other family members’ concerns. “We’ll investigate with the House of Traditional Leaders.”
