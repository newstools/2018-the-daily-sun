Nthabiseng (25) told Daily Sun she met Thabang in 2009, but a year later their relationship had turned sour.  She claimed he  accused her of cheating.  Nthabiseng ended the relationship but the two got back together in 2012.  “Things didn’t change and I ended things for good,” she said.  The attempted murder and assault case was postponed to 13 March.
