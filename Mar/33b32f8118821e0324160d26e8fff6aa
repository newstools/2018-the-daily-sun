THE ANC will not be bullied or told who to appoint as mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay. This is what the party secretary-general said during a media briefing at Luthuli House in Joburg yesterday. He was responding to statements made by EFF leader Julius Malema, who said he preferred someone like former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas to become mayor of the metro. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvSEp668GHwpHmhwVBKjM08mc1FNLCrWzlBVuYtYq2e--si4FdlsEBrkDpZfD7k___ZLZwk7LxfKzXwBthrogrwbThcaB_ARQMJFV6QdEV07nw_RPKvxfCGMDjqZ69AiiJAtT8dkYXs2iLJdKrqdx-UtMvu-HEApGCh0ZUX5uZjy56-3c58f-CXn9Jm7WGVGF9Nel7TAshlv0P4m_M9JlEc6pZk2B7KjY_eSlVB1kvlkOjF5lYxcOelydWSjXlgGJi888OJY31TQwZD-lMjSXJoqesP5bI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAk0g7ferN6PEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They can’t be telling us who must be our candidates. I’m sure the ANC will engage everybody.” Magashule also announced that Mpumalanga and the Free State will get women premiers. Sisi Ntombela is the premier elect for the Free State and Refilwe Mtshweni for Mpumalanga. Mtshweni said: “I promise to do the best I can to make sure we steer the ship in the right direction.” Meanwhile, Ntombela said she knew it would be tough for her as a woman to lead the Free State.“But I’m ready to do my best,” said Ntombela.
