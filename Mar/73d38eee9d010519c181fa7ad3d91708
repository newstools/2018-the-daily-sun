IN a horrific double tragedy, a six-month-old boy was
crushed to death by a faulty lift – and his mum suffered the same fate a few
minutes later as she desperately tried to save him.According to The
Sun, Natalia Simonova (38) left her ninth floor flat last week to take her
son Vladimir for a walk in his pram. The elevator got jammed between the fourth and third
floors, and Natalia tried to force her son in his pram through the gap.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstbd5BzVZrRfdkyEgCazHI6zKaIAKGYn7wu3FEcPDbI12-IGbY6Ro0qDXx8y3kMthgHNGQGBgpRm99Ur-u9dnG55ZYs6Gn5Louc0n7SvxnM0CEJIkNdVJNvG1QdQVSKdyM0Qt7QQhWpdc37L0ikcD-Ir05cCVAk53W9m02YJIuq7GGw28MULNaqaviLaXY_b0oapn2EGaqoTZyMz--8dQXUcmX9SSHqATOzv2065Lo2twgOQmCx5l3IDsA657b_vehFIw3BQUuEqrMm6WUmwDI39xVa5SY5QEyKHw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDCz0K4TWh_EEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

started moving up and down, crushing little Vladimir to death!A panicking Natalia called her husband Oleg who was in
their flat.Oleg is quoted in the report as saying: “She called me
from the lift, crying and shouting, saying our baby was dead."He and a male relative rushed down the stairs to help. “My son was
squeezed together with his pram, he was hanging there with his head down. “We thought he might be still alive.“We cut the pram and then the lift suddenly began to move
up killing my wife too. “The lift was just
going crazily up and down…“First it killed our son, and then it killed my wife too.“I can’t believe that they are both dead now,” said Oleg.Angry neighbours say that they had repeatedly complained
about the faulty lift, but authorities had ignored them. Heartbroken Oleg has
vowed to sue those responsible.Natalia and Vladimir were buried in the same coffin.Oleg is now a single dad to kids Valeria (14) and Mikhail
(8).A criminal investigation is now underway.
