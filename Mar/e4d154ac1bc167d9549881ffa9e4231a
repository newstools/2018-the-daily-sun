During a meeting in 2013, Ajay Gupta told Sundaram that Zuma had suggested the name “Africa News Network” for the TV channel.Sundaram said it was clear the Guptas knew Zuma intimately. “We call him Baba”, Atul Gupta allegedly told Sundaram. Zuma also suggested that then government spokesman Mzwanele Manyi should be considered as an ANN7 talkshow host. While Manyi was unimpressive at the interviews, he was still employed.“President Zuma will have it no other way,” said Nazeem Howa, a senior Gupta executive.Sundaram first met Duduzane Zuma at a meeting with the Gupta brothers and Jacob Zuma in August 2013.Sundaram was told the next day that Howa and Atul Gupta clinched R20 million in business during the meeting.Sundaram also explained how Gupta lieutenant Ashu Chawla requested that employees be granted expedited “inter-company transfer” visas for employees based in India by confirming they were employed by Essel Media India, a company with close ties to the Guptas.Sundaram’s two-year contract came to an abrupt end in August 2013. – NEWS24
