SAFA Arbitrator Nassir Cassim SC has ruled that the Tendai Ndoro matter be referred to the world football governing body, Fifa arguing the PSLâ€™s Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) does not have jurisdiction over the matter.Orlando Pirates and Polokwane City had lodged a protest with the PSL arguing that Ajax Cape Town had contravened Fifa rules by fielding the player. The player played for Pirates before signing for a Saudi Arabia side Al Faisaly before returning to the PSL to join Ajax.Fifa rules prohibit a player to play for three different clubs in a single season.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstooI_R4DNqAXnSwUbSMKQhrxzfQKHZjLpBr7i6n5bJ4k2tWvOnfb2_NL-M93j6aZ8r5h2KxiNDg-cSaG7rfndmK6mV5InCakqwzIVRIMCr4jx3v7it4Zlc3nwk9Dek3AlyJHOm1tVjYV4Wpy8IdmiVHhjxldI2Z18jyjR3bKziwf6aMhxuPsFx8i71j3BqTIi6RBwOIkcfIBFbGc4ZDL_52RV8oKvv8MdWSvjsjIoLl1jxrYLKQPpCVOSvhYkY73I-6OznnK3fnZ-f-1KNKVJNLw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHay-Ge6jckMEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
