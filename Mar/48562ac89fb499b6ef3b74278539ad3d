SAFA Arbitrator Nassir Cassim SC has ruled that the Tendai Ndoro matter be referred to the world football governing body, Fifa arguing the PSLâ€™s Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) does not have jurisdiction over the matter.Orlando Pirates and Polokwane City had lodged a protest with the PSL arguing that Ajax Cape Town had contravened Fifa rules by fielding the player. The player played for Pirates before signing for a Saudi Arabia side Al Faisaly before returning to the PSL to join Ajax.Fifa rules prohibit a player to play for three different clubs in a single season.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstEpYDzsA83xnifnnhbuasOACBeieLWu0c_E4f2VazULkFyJZTT0SEJMZue4vx-ExJGONO4E8emVa4aTmw6fEEkekNQEIDi4j24KNzWkbbuVF08WU0OSrj9r-d5lKXp-933eATfp_quVnHTANrPlLiVR6BSHvD-5htBfUCOGnv9YpnK16x1MqmCTQoBG16U959jIWM_Bm1TvOeTqL9a2bBsHmDj-7w1-8IaMLIKTD7Ug8PBx7eIYhxlC7ScOKIIpo70ylGJBsVXS9SohXRXBDSsVw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFmnOHGT9aL9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
