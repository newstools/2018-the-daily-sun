The victims are gogo Elizabeth Mavuso (82), Zandile Msimango (19) and eight-month-old Anathi Msimango. Relative Nunu Msimango said the family was struggling to come to terms with what had happened.“I was with them yesterday,” Nunu told Daily Sun. “This must be a dream. Can someone please wake me up? “We’re still in shock and trying to make sense of everything.”Emergency Services spokesman William Ntladi said an emergency vehicle was sent to the scene. “On arrival, the officials found the lifeless bodies of an elderly woman, a young woman and a baby,” said Ntladi. “When paramedics attended to them, they didn’t respond and they were declared dead on the scene.“Two other people, a 50-year-old man and a seven-year-old boy, were found in the house and responded positively. “They were sent to Far East Rand Hospital for medical attention.” Meanwhile, Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina is expected to visit the family today to pass on his condolences.The mayor will also speak to community leaders with a view to educating them about the dangers of having open flames inside a closed space.
