THE Democratic Alliance wants public protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane to be axed. The DA said it will write to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, to again follow up on the request that Parliament institute proceedings in terms of section 194 of the Constitution to remove the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane.On Wednesday, the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria rejected an application by the Public Protector to appeal against a judgment of the court in the matter of ABSA Bank Limited & Others v the Public Protector Case No 48123/2017 in which she was ordered to personally pay 15% of the costs due to her gross incompetence.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuNClRmn9Pd_hWno_s02exnm4MrZaUKTAlP8Gf2P5EDteIlGHtWuYQ6SjTnAJm6pCQ1iKZloRVc4bo2_IyIhl6Y5mv8ull6Z_Hq8WDf1jHxjb9F7qO8GV7TPXYeK_KhTWEBwhd-sdPT6xTYT6wmGW-3hXDX24L9yY7xRVtXMnoiAnVT2giIn-JQUmEVvG3gNtdRQyvDGPYCr1rulm-07hYuNU9CF9uBscjZ9oHz_KLRxtFR4kQJJcxZ_C9mVjATa3v8SuzfpYYwiT3ZZuFQ3ew23VWQLxc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMcxSWh0wwuPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We simply cannot allow Advocate Mkhwebane to remain in office and continue to deride its reputation given her conduct and the court rulings against her."
