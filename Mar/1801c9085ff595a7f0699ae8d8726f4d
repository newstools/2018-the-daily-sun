She went to investigate and found her daughter’ body lying in the street.“I tried to wake her up but she was already dead,” she said. Their daughter had been struck by a car driven by a drunk driver. Police took statements and she was sure the man would be arrested in no time.“But after the funeral the police told us they were still looking for the man. My husband and I decided we will help to capture the killer. We tracked down one of the man’s friends and took the information to the police,” said Emma.Mpho said they had spent more than R6 000 tracking down the killer.“It seems the police don’t want to help us,” he said.Soshanguve police spokeswoman Constable Zanele Mtsweni said a case of culpable homicide was opened.“The case has been investigated thoroughly and prioritised like any other cases. No suspect has been arrested as yet, as police are still looking for new information,” she said.
