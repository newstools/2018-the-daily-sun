The meat was allegedly contaminated with Listeria,” said Motloung.He said the truck was escorted back to Matatiele Wholesalers to be offloaded. “The chicken will be destroyed according to the health department’s instructions,” said the spokesman.Last week, Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said the department had found the source of the Listeriosis outbreak. To date, there are 967 reported cases of the foodborne disease. The death toll currently stands at 183.Motsoaledi said traces of Listeria bacteria were found at an Enterprise Food factory in Polokwane, Limpopo.Cold meat products such as polony, Russians and frankfurters produced in the factory were recalled. Rainbow Chicken foods said in an update on Friday: “Rainbow polony products can be returned to the store where the product was purchased for a full refund. The recall concerns only polony. All other Rainbow Chicken products produced at our other plants are not subject to this recall. This includes fresh and frozen products,” the update read.
