Lerato Kganyago has unofficially earned herself the title of being the queen of Twitter clapbacks and blocking.In a digital era full of trolls who live off of getting a reaction out of celebrities, LKG seems to have lost her patience for all online slander.The star has been in the media on numerous occasions for her spicy clapbacks and blocking every single person who says something she doesn't like.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv9LY89Kfq3nbdnJbSyUsNWyf_0Tg_8KCoIkxM10v9N1guHc2eHqXx6YN5vY45gjf-4BAgB1GL0yNNHucf4QED9052-jSr23s5ijayNYkeX_U_48tt9QopFQHcfdi5xtOLqYLlJ6CAujDEPnXjNMqONAeQaWs0StM8EQ4A_chkRsIcADkCoilT-g_pblfwT3mb-kqdNaf78RdWfsVocZvP5N1WhyHHCKs8Wu9-E7L8Q_3woTAti4tr3k-sdFYmBpZ27HJ3nA8X8-B2nc6P7B-S5mk8iaSBctioRYA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzF3YoMfetGI-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I don’t want to mess with your hustle. But please delete this before it becomes a legal matter. Thanks,” LKG said to the blogger on Twitter.But what she failed to realize was that the headline was in quotation marks, meaning that it was the words of someone else and not those of the publication.The blog was quoting the words of controversial queen of the dancefloor Skolopad who tweeted: “Ok thanks, now I know she can rest in peace”.Skolopad was responding to LKG blocking her earlier this month.Nevertheless, Owamie has put out a video apologizing to LKG and saying that there are no hard feelings.
