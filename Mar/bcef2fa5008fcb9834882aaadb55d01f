The nurses said I should go to another clinic, but this is the only one around here,” she said.Regopotswe Marang (22) said: “I went to the clinic to get birth control pills.“Today is the last day I can take them because if I don’t, I might fall pregnant and my mum would kill me. Now I don’t know what to do because I don’t have the money to go to the pharmacy,” she said.Gogo Elizabeth Mokwena (65) condemned what the protesters did.“It’s so sad for us because we are chronic patients. People who vandalised and stole things at the clinic are heartless and deserve to be in jail.” Cilliers Brink, member of the mayoral committee for corporate services in Tshwane, said: “It is an unfortunate reality that when these criminal acts occur, the people making use of these facilities and the most vulnerable in our city suffer the most.“ We view the incident as an act of sabotage to overshadow the work that the DA-led multi-party is doing in the community.” Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba, spokesman for the Tshwane Metro police, said they were investigating the matter.“No one has been arrested, but a case of malicious damage to property has been opened.”
