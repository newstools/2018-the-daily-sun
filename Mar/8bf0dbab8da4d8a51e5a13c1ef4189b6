He said they were not worried as the Hlelas are their relatives.“We started to worry after two days. We sent kids to the Hlela family to find out if Mzwenkosi was still there. We were shocked when we heard that Mzwenkosi had left immediately after the wedding.” Vika, who is a local induna, said he reported his nephew missing to the police.On Friday morning he received a call from one of the road cleaners.“He told me to rush to the main road. “The workers told us they were clearing the road when they saw a body.” Vika said Mzwenkosi’s friends told the family he had gone to the local tavern after the wedding.“We believe he was killed at that tavern and dumped in the bush. We also believe he was strangled as there were no injuries to his body.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said an inquest was being investigated by Umbumbulu cops. “A post mortem will reveal the cause of death.”
