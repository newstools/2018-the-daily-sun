Land audits have revealed that 72% of the land is still in the private hands of a minority,” she said. Secretary-general Ace Magashule said they commended ANC MPs for taking the bold step of supporting the EFF’s motion for expropriation of land without compensation. The motion was tabled in parliament by EFF leader Julius Malema and was passed with 241 MPs voting in favour of it and 83 against it. Magashule said the ANC was preparing for next year’s election, and that’s why the heads of organisational departments had to be stationed at Luthuli House permanently. He said in preparation for its coming political programme on the ground, the party would be inviting former presidents Thabo Mbeki, Kgalema Motlanthe and Jacob Zuma to participate.
