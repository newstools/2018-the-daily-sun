first raped by her brother-in-law.The sixteen-year-old was sold to a gang in the city of Valladolid
and her seventeen-year-old sister to a gang in Zamora, about 100kms away from
each other in the north of Spain. The older sister apparently sold them for 10 000 Euros
each (about R146 500).Luckily for the girls, a resident in Zamora tipped the
cops off in November 2017 that two teens had been sold to gangs.Their investigation resulted in the girls being found and
seven people arrested.Unfortunately the older teen was found in poor health,
but both have now been sent to a public care centre for treatment.The report did not say whether the evil older sister and
her husband were among those arrested.
