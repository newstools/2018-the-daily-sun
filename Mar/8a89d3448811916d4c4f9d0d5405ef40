CORRUPTION doesn’t only happen at high levels of power, as most people might imagine.It also happens at schools, where workers apparently steal feeding scheme food meant for schoolkids.But the woman who exposed the thieving workers, Shirley Khumalo, now lives in fear.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuMoi6u7gHoXyFnyMi_G_RjUAXFcj-Fc9H3xsd5YGFVTgzLc_fjLsvdQkQraabvVwsXmNtAh0swZJFH3ISDwf_sRI9tr3jCVPhrPBsNy1wrS4dz0-T7zUykjk14TXNy90NHPlkdc4kzv3XMkKSHaly0yYFEgZlUKYueW9wHk7EjU4ONX8qCKGy6zk_HpZM_-k4Cs137YMcoYqD7s8R_ia9XmQ452NV-ChcE4MroMnoDf3pw9pigPkpogbGusjrNUd1eAkNcWKNBmJRBsbCLXKm1UGX3xPY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDXorqifqcxWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Shirley (32) said just two weeks into the job, she saw two women hiding trays stacked with tinned fish. She said she reported them to the vice-principal, who’s also the kitchen co-ordinator.“I went to the principal, but she told me to let it be,” she claimed. “I reported this to the department of education, and investigations revealed that food had indeed gone missing.”But soon the threats of violence became real.Her daughter was assaulted and Shirley was allegedly moered by the vice-principal and a kitchen staff member. “I was told to back off. I’m forced to stay at home now,” she said. “They said they won’t harm my daughter, so long as I stayed away.”Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona confirmed that a teacher was arrested for allegedly assaulting a food handler. But she was later released after the charges were dropped.Initially, the school had released Shirley from her contract after she was allegedly caught using a dirty dish cloth while serving pupils. But she was later reinstated after lodging a complaint with the CCMA.
