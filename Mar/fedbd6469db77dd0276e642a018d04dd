We understand the situation that Pirates are in the Absa Premiership title race. As everyone knows, this camp has been really compromised in terms of time for preparation. "The warning times for us to know we were taking part and leaving was very, very short,” Baxter told the media on Monday.As confirmed by the Bafana coach, there was communication breakdown, as Pirates were not properly informed of Mokwena’s call-up before the announcement was made. “What that has done is that it’s also made the lines of communication a little bit shorter, and it’s possible that protocol wasn’t followed.”Bafana will jet off to Zambia to participate in a four-nation tournament scheduled to start on 22 March .“You know, I got confirmation of the camp 10 days before we were due to leave, so the actual ‘negotiations’ if you want to call it that, for the camp were protracted. Therefore everything had to go very quickly,” he stated.
