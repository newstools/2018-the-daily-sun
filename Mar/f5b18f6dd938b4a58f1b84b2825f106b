She said her resignation was not an attempt to avoid the upcoming Commission of Inquiry into State Capture.“I’m too old to be running to any other country,” she said, about moving to Dubai.“I will be going to the inquiry.”She said she was one of the people calling for an inquiry into state capture. The office of the ANC Chief Whip yesterday confirmed her resignation, saying it was effective as of Tuesday. Brown joined the National Assembly in 2014 after acting as a member of the Western Cape legislature in various capacities.Her stint as minister was plagued by a series of scandals arising from various appointments, particularly at Eskom.
