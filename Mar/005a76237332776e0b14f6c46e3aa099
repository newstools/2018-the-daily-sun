high rate of TB-infected patients dropping out of TB treatments with great
concern.This was
after World TB Day was commemorated on 24 March.According
to Dr Phalatse, out of the 14 648 TB cases tracked by the City’s Heath
Department in 2016, 12 797 were initiated on treatment.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss20tfAI8KJB4R81e2d6lCWNLZhmdGel-JEe73b0sdpVBgbJNSlyjfsWkhu-Y-7WFak_FUPuBDE6WhfKRQr41MAkl4JxYZ3jjiPbAL825ak1SICu4wjNYOmcv-J00JpqZJ3XgAepBucrxn1b4dntFLfeFPWbChdYsH3jurrQn8zbBubqkCO_LzWZMnw62AoN26hQ2EC_iDhwShSwP9f-txk70evd2crZifriVFsD94Kv9X1b7lbgdz_FBDm90ygdo8nBUEVKfwFLmp5uu-vMQ9EMUXo55k\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPEAAfNiQ7ubEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

12 797, 9669 completed their treatment.This means
that 852 defaulted from treatment.A total of
3128 patients were cured, and 740 deaths were recorded.“I’m
concerned about the high default rate in some areas in the City,” Dr Phalatse
said.“Though our
Community Health Workers are available to track defaulters and provide
treatment support, their efforts are often hampered by the provision of wrong
addresses when patients open files at the clinic.“We believe
this is because of a fear of being turned away if they (patients) do not reside
within the clinic’s geographic catchment area,” said Phalatse.Phalatse
also announced that the City of Joburg will be hosting TB dialogues across
Joburg.The aim of
the dialogues is to involve community leaders like school principals, church
and traditional leaders, crèche managers and hostel indunas in the fight
against TB.“While
anyone can contract TB, the disease thrives among people living in poverty and
compromised environments, including those with diseases such as HIV/AIDS and
factors such as malnutrition, poor housing and sanitation, compounded by other
risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse, as well as diabetes affect
vulnerability to TB and access to care,” Phalatse said.Phalatse
has called for TB patients to use any clinic of their choice, and also said
that the Health Department has established pick-up points across Joburg for TB
patients to collect their medication easily.
