It is paramount [to note] that most of the learners at the said schools are from disadvantaged communities and as such we must provide food for them every day," said Lesufi.He urged community members with information on the incidents to alert the police so arrests can be made."Our schools cannot afford to be a haven for criminals, this cannot be tolerated," he said.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/gauteng-criminals-target-schools-for-electronics-food-20180323
