CYRIL Ramaphosa has been president of the ANC for over two months. However, walking past the ANC’s KZN offices in Durban, you could have been forgiven for thinking Jacob Zuma was still in charge. This was the complaint of Ramaphosa’s supporters in the province before a giant photo of Zuma hanging outside the building was replaced on Thursday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst_kP-r3dqf1RKK85M_qUJnMlF9kxAOMpfEymzIQ6rkYvs4W3nOp7IdjclQ4BfG8574m69T26ABDNmnZ6RiEFVAbS4JQFMEL1zi1QVX3Y5xeo9V1c38wCQrRjTyUbDqMWvVEJe5cAlmhi10QURXUFmueLqOc-AXWHMH0MLjpL_GX1VS9U-IhZXo_BKqYrOKOO2Q98GzL1R9c6o5U8dP01D2cUyMteT4mcLqMjuEabc4kQ2MH6vLii4dS5ZMvAA3uA30kDc4kV6rldaLd7fn6yjgZzJ1I9U\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzE2D_aZfIx2FEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The photo of Zuma had apparently cemented divisions among party members in the province. Ramaphosa backers accused the provincial interim leadership of undermining Ramaphosa because their candidate, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma didn’t win at the elective conference in December.A Ramaphosa supporter told Daily Sun: “We are happy they have finally accepted that Ramaphosa is president but now they must accept him in their hearts as well. “We are still concerned that the interim provincial committee is full of former provincial executive committee members.” Ramaphosa’s supporters said they were not happy that Zuma was part of the voter registration drive, saying corruption accusations against him continued to damage the ANC’s reputation. During a media briefing on Thursday, ANC election campaign head Fikile Mbalula said the party would use all members, including Zuma, during its campaigns. Provincial secretary Super Zuma said people were confusing the government’s rules with the party’s. He said once a new president is appointed, photos of him must be hung in all government departments but this was not the case within the party.
