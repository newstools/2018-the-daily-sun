POLOKWANE City eased their relegation troubles last night following a 2-0 win over Bloemfontein Celtic in an Absa Premiership match played at Dr Molemela Stadium.The win was special for Rise and Shine as they now occupy 11th spot on 27 points from 23 games, while Celtic remain in ninth position with 29 points from the same number of games. This was a catch-up match that was postponed in February due to the passing of Polokwane defender Mogau Tshehla in a car accident.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstBObuJs-tL4LcO5V4J1l8SFJe8LFmIFWZE1ZQbXNisl5J6r6JP11l4_XVmSbrlCVouNS5CcJNZbeunhoHs1mQ-KqTYwWck12sUrh183tN-zJUd72z5A-t8mH3Hh8bPbu3nJlMj3rTjnXNccdbgzT4oINdmNh80jsemvRRtDPqv5eUXv1onb_3PwIC_dubq63KjouLxQB5sxvncNZsO58WKCNKwfO6JpGcpDWUhnV0o-xlNH4rwc0m4-_PemR3QR-VUqk5seY1gzyP8P7-kNYrp6g\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YRpJNxG8Nt8eAn5Sj02XwDEd_BJ8CFAx7anl5VugDMN-AD4W8UGlPah92Orfr7ViQNCuv00-rUYWK89zCAlYaE7wuXaMFzVfDafFhE_\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFacNNzMCLLxEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They ended Celticâ€™s dominance over them having lost 2-1 in the first round. The victory was sweet as Polokwane had never beaten Celtic in Mangaung since 2008-09 season.Molekwa made four changes to his starting line-up as he also tightened his leaky defence when he gave Simphiwe Hlongwane a run. On the other hand, Celtic were hoping to keep consistency having ended their six games unbeaten run on Sunday when they beat struggling Ajax Cape Town 1-0 at the same venue. Celtic coach Veselin Jelusic only made one change as he gave Tshegofatso Mabaso the nod in place of Jacky Motshegwa who was on the bench.Both teams used a cautious approach with the game being played at a slow pace early on as neither side wanted to make mistakes, but the game became alive after the half hour mark when Polokwane City midfielder Thabiso Semenya broke the stalemate with an easy tap in following a great pass from Phiri. The goal brought a sense of urgency to the Celtic players who pushed forward in numbers in a bid to grab the equaliser. But their woes worsened in the 37th minute when goalkeeper Patrick Tignyemb fell with the ball over the goal-line while trying to save a tame shot from Polokwane defender Marvin Sikhosana who was credited with the second goal.However, Sikhosana went from hero to villain as he was showed a red card in the 63rd minutes for simulation.
