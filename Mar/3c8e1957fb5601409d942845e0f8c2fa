It is calling for the punishment of pastors who charge for their sessions and encourage families to kidnap relatives who have other religious beliefs.At Vuyisile Mini Square in Port Elizabeth, protesters signed a petition to support those urging their governments to close down groups which practise forced conversion.Co-ordinator Caron Strydom said: “People being deprived of basic human rights and children being barred from school in the name of religion are signs of cult-like activities.”“There is an urgent need for pastors who lead forced conversion programmes to be punished to avoid negative consequences and death.”
