CAPE Town City defender Robyn Johannes is ready to stop the pacy Orlando Pirates attack and increase their chances of winning the Nedbank Cup.The teams will battle it out in the Last 16 round at Cape Town Stadium tonight (7.30pm). The Citizens are eager to avenge the 1-0 defeat they suffered to Bucs in the Absa Premiership first round.Said Johannes: “It’s a final before the final. It will be a difficult game, it’s a big task. In a game like this, form is thrown out the window – it’s about who wants it most on the day.

But the Nedbank Cup is a great opportunity to win something and salvage a season of ups and downs. “Pirates are a big obstacle – we will need to overcome them to go all the way to the final.”The former Bucs star hopes progressing in the competition will help erase the bad season they’ve had, which saw them drop from the top of the league standings down to sixth spot. “We have had lots of ups and downs this season. We want to get close to the pack at the top as quickly as we can. This is an opportunity to shift focus a bit, to challenge for the cup and forget about the league for a while.”Johannes hopes their scoring drought will be a thing of the past from tonight’s match onwards. City have scored 23 league goals and conceded the same number. “It’s always difficult after losing players like Lebo (Manyama), Aubrey (Ngoma) and (Lehlohonolo) Majoro, who left us. But I think the management did well to get players who they think can solve the problem for us. I hope that happens. “Obviously we have been shy of goals. We have been working hard at training and the coach also works hard on finishing, so hopefully that changes.”However, Johannes admitted that the league title is now out of reach for them. “I think it is out of our hands but you never want to give up on it, you always want to keep going until the end. We still want to give it our best shot and end in the best position.” Bucs captain Happy Jele says they have a plan up their sleeves to breach City’s defence – led by the very same Johannes.“We are not happy that we lost in the final last year (4-1 to SuperSport United). We will try by all means to progress further this time. We’ve done our homework on Cape Town City – how to penetrate them, the good and bad things they do on the field.”
