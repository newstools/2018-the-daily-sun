But we still have more challenges,” she said. “When pupils are in class, they have to go to the hostel to use the toilet. We also have an issue with potholes in the road, which makes it difficult for blind pupils to walk.” Starts from SABC1 shows like Generations, Skeem Saam, TBT and Xpressions gave pupils motivational talks.Generations actress Brenda Mhlongo, who plays Nandi on the popular soapie, said: “You are not disabled. You have disabilities and you can do many great things. You can do things your own way.” Skeem Saam actor Cedric Fourie, who plays Lehasa, told the kids they were his heroes. “I have never seen kids who push more than you at normal schools. Soldier on and remember there is no future without education,” he said. SABC Foundation CEO Iris Cupido said making the donation was their way of keeping a promise they made to the school when they first visited in January.
