AN American court heard last week how a dad attacked his
three-month-old daughter so viciously that he broke ribs and gave her brain
injuries – apparently because he had wanted a son.According to The
Mirror, Jason Bittner (33) from Cincinnati in Ohio allegedly beat his
youngest daughter Aimee in February because she wouldn’t stop fussing, landing
her up in hospital.His wife Casey took her to hospital saying she’d had “an
accident”, but healthcare workers didn’t buy her story and notified the cops.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstaQ5HjYXjpIrMooAcIUdf3moo2GPYT-FrIU4cmPN39iOhYvgnGdAGg7pSXrFK2ImUuX8KFvK7So7mUU6JMPwaaH9WrzvZhGCajAX9wU_JtF2GkownYupoys_q82zexzeTAh61_OHD_FgpRLDHKKmyb-DHSGPLCM6BRu7KFKchH1d2M7bpqz2dpsePU2iZf-7lxN_VcofssCGv_L_UmPb6jMKF9uBi61C14_BnFawke-EbhLGnqT5nMoHfOaLmO21dE77rAQrtqxCPDqQgE1vt6OyLAgLnw0hcatg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMCHhXp6x4EiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

at his practice and charged with assault and endangering children.He denies the charges.Prosecutor David Fornshell told Fox 19: ‘He was frankly
resentful of the fact [she is a girl] and also was very intolerant of the fact
that she fussed.“Dr Bittner is a medical professional.“By all accounts he’s a member of good standing in the
community.“He’s active in his church and I think people think that
people like that are incapable of committing acts of child abuse or even
domestic violence and those kinds of situations.But unfortunately those types of acts are committed by
all manner of people.”The little girl has since been released from hospital. Bittner is due to appear in court again next week.
