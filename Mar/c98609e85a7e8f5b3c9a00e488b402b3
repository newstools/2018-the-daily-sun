METRORAIL has temporarily suspended its operations in Koedoespoort and Pienaarspoort stations East of Pretoria.The operations were suspended following a series of staff assaults, train hijackings and attacks against its commuters on the Mamelodi corridor."In a period of less than a week more than 10 employees were attacked and withdrawn from operations. In addition more than 6 trains have been withdrawn from service due to malicious damage to property," Metrorail said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuf2KvKUy4O2Xn4dhKWDyJBey4lRxmX2tpENtRbcJKdT0KfksK3QXWp5ZDUMzn9mY0pan4qxhk9shJBxZwNk48BNq-1gwP_EEGkrcLWz8k3B_6saqP4yg3IQW7y43Jf2zZo8NwyvkVQfTvWFt_uG58nHOZ52_PnISQIr_wHoF0JojTSMxZtopMnm9zqo_6gRV3urkxBk1d5T-gQTcsT9VlYgeeP7ulrCBkNIP2LPZnk_yKwqlOt_oougYZ2GlXuECzAkkaIxH5Ilj8la4hO4uCVzUirTaw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKPWjTAxrBVfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
