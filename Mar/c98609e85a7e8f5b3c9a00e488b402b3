METRORAIL has temporarily suspended its operations in Koedoespoort and Pienaarspoort stations East of Pretoria.The operations were suspended following a series of staff assaults, train hijackings and attacks against its commuters on the Mamelodi corridor."In a period of less than a week more than 10 employees were attacked and withdrawn from operations. In addition more than 6 trains have been withdrawn from service due to malicious damage to property," Metrorail said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsttT22uwghrLWaHjkNjdPCAJiZmU745x24fBWgMHHWvxXf1llwJpWrksDaM9tHejb74v1lJTrK515_ujN2Y1E2IdHjflAkrwMh_3tb_1ODhh1k0QJmKona9ygGtnbG3C32KmW23Jg5D6BzB6Sgp9vOiNvb4LaNJuCUxPbAVl-SisWMcmgoYqL872zMBcPu-IW-vS3B5ZHVCv5yqZfvBGK7aA5UGKkj1cgggktMCWy1i31JNPXfEntqvRXPMYK89hfnaITM91crX53XTRvEIvM1HbJCYLb4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCuv6E6orzrMEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
