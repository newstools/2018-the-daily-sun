METRORAIL has temporarily suspended its operations in Koedoespoort and Pienaarspoort stations East of Pretoria.The operations were suspended following a series of staff assaults, train hijackings and attacks against its commuters on the Mamelodi corridor."In a period of less than a week more than 10 employees were attacked and withdrawn from operations. In addition more than 6 trains have been withdrawn from service due to malicious damage to property," Metrorail said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssStMw-c6Sez5LrU0QcK4PrjNnq3xrGLC1NJWmAh3dvMTlX-pJ3mooE1SDdZtPynob0Zrr-JZjV4x3bgQxg2pP0AoSGzPYnRYdbp-kVvRyhkMbVU33uDSytgEgPgOYNdJHMlfMdhJ75m7wDam3POapevIoWL6WZAGuBcNtoVp96U1cvPjl5pdX49sdhNHykfKGQngKOODa96YHQf2ioA_V7W520b5WIGoHaClHXAQ4MX8LXNPmzCdKqtuqz0_JaoJn_4Xp7KDXXD5liIQiRBTvU0bAlmBM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLy_r1YX26UAEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
