METRORAIL has temporarily suspended its operations in Koedoespoort and Pienaarspoort stations East of Pretoria.The operations were suspended following a series of staff assaults, train hijackings and attacks against its commuters on the Mamelodi corridor."In a period of less than a week more than 10 employees were attacked and withdrawn from operations. In addition more than 6 trains have been withdrawn from service due to malicious damage to property," Metrorail said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssVvL6mbM2KL8g18esw4j4Gbi9sViQtxfDpelG4VbEXSLGCkls5A_ZIiVwDaOSrP2NM4HCSGypcd5DNQD1sIRNPi0kF6icSK1VQdWg582MeNUZvsw6bCPw77bdMU-ZvqEF_Z4_OLErZm8T85owiteDJb9u78uWuEeSfi4VCsGHL48aU8HYbv-H172Pj5xZbROaD3KNMLoSPwSej5LVLVaFXns1JVsZAte3EgWWvuPONa6FZn89FHAwNCWUmQzxTifa70Fc2Zrqd6qobI7_Z5WSv87fF2VI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPYRmcE8HLVyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
