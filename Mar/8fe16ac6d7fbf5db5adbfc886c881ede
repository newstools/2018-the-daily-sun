She died in December and our plans died with her.” The couple were together for five years and had four children. Three live with Nombuso’s family in KwaZulu-Natal, while the youngest one lives with Kelvin.The sad dad is appealing to Daily Sun readers to help him trace Nombuso’s family so he can bury the love of his life. “She is at the mortuary as I’m still trying to find the family. I don’t want to deceive them and bury her without them.” Kelvin said he has tried everything possible to find them but failed.“I’m hoping when I find them, I can accomplish what we had planned to do. “I want to pay lobola.” He said they were so in love that he wanted to make Nombuso his wife.“We were happy together. “It was like a match made in heaven. I’ve never met her parents, her family or friends. “Every time we planned to see her mum in Durban or her father in Kimberley, something came up and we ended up postponing it.“I just want to give her a deserving send-off as a sign of my love. I couldn’t marry her when she was alive. I want her funeral to be like our wedding but need to find her family first,” said Kelvin.
