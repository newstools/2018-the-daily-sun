She talked the attackers out of hurting the children, after which they hurt her." Cameron said the woman did not want to go back to her home.The alleged attacker is expected to appear in the Hankey Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. He is charged with house robbery, attempted murder, rape, pointing of a firearm, assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm, theft and abduction. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/man-arrested-after-eastern-cape-woman-was-shot-raped-abducted-20180326
