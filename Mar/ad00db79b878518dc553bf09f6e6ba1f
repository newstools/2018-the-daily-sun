The protesters demanded that the police station commander be sacked.Zuma thanked the residents for supporting him.“This police station no longer has a station commander. She is the president of criminals.“The cops should be chasing criminals instead of terrorising innocent people who are fighting crime,” he said.Zuma claimed the cops arrested him just to prove a point: “They have an agenda. These cops just want to victimise me.”Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the residents’ claims would be investigated.He said: “We can’t just remove someone without investigating.“We will also look at their memorandum of grievances.”
