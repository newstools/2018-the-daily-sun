million US dollars plus his monthly pension of more than $13 000 in cash,
reports the Sunday Mail.Public Service Commission Chairperson Mariyawanda Nzuwah
wrote in a letter to central bank chief John Mangudya: "The former
president was being paid his salary in cash and he has requested that the same
arrangement be maintained.""We are kindly requesting you to avail cash amounting
to $467 200 and monthly cash amounts of $13 333 for us to pay the former

shortages have plagued ordinary Zimbabweans for nearly two years.A source in the office of the new president said Emmerson
Mnangagwa recently turned down an attempt to be paid in cash like his
predecessor.The president is reported to have told a visiting government
bank official "that if he needed cash he would queue for it like everyone
else because the cash shortages affected all Zimbabweans and he would demand no
such preferential and irregular treatment."https://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/mugabe-demands-cash-and-hes-been-getting-20-000-a-month-report-20180311
