I have played with him, and I know him personally, he also knows Pirates.“But when we go there it will be a war.”The Pirates veteran defender added: “He also has Rayaan who was with us not so long ago. It’s going to be difficult, but we are looking forward to winning this game. “Jacobs knows each and everyone in the team, but in football you will never know. He (Rayaan) used to be here with coach Micho (Milutin Sredojevic) and Rhulani Mokoena.”These two clubs have met once this season and Pirates won that encounter with 1-0, thanks to Thabo Qalinge’s last minutes goal.To reach the last 16 of the competition Pirates defeated ABC Motsepe League side Orbit College 3-1 in the last 32 while the Citizens got better of Bidvest Wits when they defeat them 1-0.
