My only option is to buy a leg from a private doctor,” she said. “The problem is, the doctor wants R40 000.”She has tried her best to get donations and has managed to raise half the money.“I am pleading with people out there to help me get the rest of the money.”If you would like to help Bridget, please contact the Daily Sun’s offices.
