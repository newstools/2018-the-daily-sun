Some of us have been depressed by this situation and are very frustrated,” said the staff member.Another worker said councillors feel unsafe as they do not bodyguards anymore.“The financial situation is bad at this municipality. Most of us have started to look for other jobs because we realise it will come to a time when we will be working for free. “As I speak, management is trying to figure out where they will get the money to run the municipality after three months.“We do not know how we got to this point and the most frustrated are the councillors because they don’t feel safe without bodyguards,” said the worker.Alfred Duma municipal spokesman Siya Maphalala said it is true the municipality is going through financial crisis.“But that does not mean that it is not able to function. “I cannot comment on whether it is true that the municipality is left with money that will only last for three months. “All I can say is the municipality is making sure that the financial crisis is sorted out,” said Maphalala.
