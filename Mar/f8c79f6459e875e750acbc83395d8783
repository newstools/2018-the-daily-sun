TV host and musician Nandi Madida is in the process of starting a farm for her son Shaka. The celeb shared the news on instagram, explaining why doing this is important to her. "Last year I bought my son some land as his first birthday gift and have begun building a farm for him, which he will then hand done to his kids and so on. As you know I rarely show material things on my page, but this was a very proud moment for me as his mother because this is a legacy that will last for many generations to come. It’s the same as Colour (my fashion line) and the other businesses I’m apart of which you’ll soon learn about, I want my children to understand generational wealth.", Nandi said. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuob7AuLu9ISbiRA_lyTuhbWx83zyarOnBD-D1xLMjLhlLM_5MV43jEJM68Nmx4JLyemSA88U4PHJYKHEOwXFiDjZjnYYNp65-tw2vTt5bIlQDM62OjF-fODsECvkN0yzpKa9Qb8k1lOaX2hz80HGPpRmcHtts9p9qUBghVgi40C_IwA2N4RGaYGR1GiJdpZJcngysJpLgtj4phYeoledZfV3cF26BXZwjv7k6abhMvfBuIfLg450RW_ugyb1CE4N5sZ9zO151IrMGU7h6eHJlsJPiXPoEJBg9u4g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHGXiPIErEahEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It’s the same as Colour @Colourfashionlabel (my fashion line) and the other businesses I’m apart of which you’ll soon learn about, I want my children to understand generational wealth. Having grown up in Durban North and having parents who come from rural KZN Maphumulo, I learnt from both backgrounds that generational wealth is more important than buying things that lose value over time (cars, clothes etc.). I am who I am because of my parents, grand parents and my ancestors. I owe it to my kids to also play my part.
