Media personality Bujy Bikwa has to rely on public transport after his brother allegedly crashed his car over the weekend. He said he received a call informing him the car had been involved in an accident early on Sunday morning. According to Bujy, he asked his older brother to park his VW Polo over the weekend and not to go out drinking. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstpduMglya0Rn63rLucq5JtEUToPyukplRCxlCB0hAkze9FGJMLp7UxZWRrZ1dPB38yqZELbj7t7HDLbF0_JzUk7NbxOXEHZimCeFwQ_igI0lpmazVcvoI0t6MDJEZQBmVYUnV6b3rYGaHM5UzeuoTsZWUjv9cVrDV3z2MH1_daYYjKYHD5kq2UjX6n1cmAgnUEOOJIkXTDd86DZxZMdBVpfPlVXFSTjJdeqghTWe2ZeM1L78qM5N_5cdcBa3PbNOp2epygFiq6lT9PUWmGLdnc7RPJxciX3YEAbQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzK9HTnUzCG8FEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>“He chose to ignore me and did whatever he pleased because I wasn’t around.” Bujy claimed he called his brother several times, pleading with him not to drive his car.But it seems his pleas fell on deaf ears.He took to Instagram to voice his frustration and posted a picture of his wrecked car.“I even asked my other brother to take the keys away from him because he doesn’t even have a driver’s licence, but that didn’t happen,” Bujy told Daily Sun.“The next thing I received a call early on Sunday morning informing me about the accident.”Bujy said his brother was injured and has to be operated on. “I know a car can be replaced,” he said.He wasn’t sure if his insurance would pay. “Family members need to stop driving people’s cars, especially when they don’t have a driver’s licence,” he said. So I asked my older brother several times over the weekend to kindly park my car, not to go out drinking with it. Here are the results! Did he not paint the town red and write off my car. ???????????????????? I am posting this cause I always fight with people who use family, friends or lovers cars without their permission. Especially with no drivers license! ?? It’s totally disrespectful and it never ends well. Now my relationship with my older brother is totally compromised. I literally pleaded with him soooooo many times “Bhuti please park my car and make sure it’s safe then go party with your friends” DOLOLO. And now I am forced to say masibonge impilo. ???????? As long as his alive. Guys please be safe this weekend and don’t drive peoples cars without their permission and don’t host a party in someone’s house cause you have the key And they are away, that house will burn down. Sorry to traumatize you so early in the morning. May this be a lesson to someone. #ThisIsNotTheBujyWayOfLifeA post shared by  Bujy Bikwa ka Thandi?? (@bujy_bikwa) on Mar 26, 2018 at 10:57pm PDT
