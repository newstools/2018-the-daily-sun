THE taxi strike planned by the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) has disrupted traffic around Ekurhuleni and surrounding areas on Tuesday morning.The strike is allegedly related to the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRT) and the delay by the Mayor of Ekurhuleni Mzwandile Masina to have talks with the taxi association."The strike is about issues that affect taxi operators, and also issues that emanate from the BRT," SANTACO's Regional Secretary BJ Mahlangu said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssn25KUp_vvW7YP724vfSDj0DlFAngoVL-DliEKF_PQYN0YDE6weJh7iZY_98HsEldYJOeQ5FYbtTihsrLmLd6nPySoiO614rLVjFF-RfuNMLLn4JYnVnHU0RjSPvHNFJC9X_t6NSBwqd0c3GRBZS-Abw9h23qweeSdlUTiNvIyxEzj8MJ4UXI-LqTrIrpc72QfgX3RxfqQCqwBY5d1pYTvFsJL2wEtUV7DZH616Hx8UPJ2rjYM6HsisV21qSy6QByrSmLUMThhgyN7hPIIDBv6PgpsJzA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOPXj06E60XqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
