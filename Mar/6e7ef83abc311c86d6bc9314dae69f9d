A MUM has spoken out on social media of her family’s
heartbreak as two of her children battle deadly cancer at the same time.According to The
Sun, mum Liliane Hajjar from Quebec in eastern Canada only found out in
January that cancer had once again returned to both her children Jacob (14) and
Sophia (5).Jacob was the same age as his sister when he was
diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer. Ten months and many
surgeries later, Jacob and his parents were told his cancer had cleared. The
surgeries had left Jacob blind in one eye and unable to hear in one ear, but
the family was just relieved he would live.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss_BzMtQE_-_5iQXzNbuHg5FzLZGh8G65FUL_xqrhhjBD8_zUfmV8ShsM3zMvWD0p-1LHz2ETnUKK5VaaDkCPGy0IkDJpxdHFlrvw4YHAmy5SFotpywO3SjO5OLjX9VOvit-ksihIa6WMgSpAR5k5xG5E02q6YeTfr7Yk5iJxqGzIoxalS__2lZSaxEwjY20a-YrH8zWajmLarZDFOloNIYPQdB85lWE8rfQFtfImi7a44bU5WXbUNWGURHcbhnupAqAxkRsEmYP_39NBCndTkjfKhhbqJUYkaG8Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAXeP5f_D1TpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

and then later Sophia were both checked for the cancerous gene. Liam was clear –
but little  Sophia tested positive, and
in 2016 doctors discovered a tumour on the left side of her brain.For a while the family enjoyed a period of peace and
hope, as both kids seemed to be in the clear.But in January this year it all went to pieces again when
it was discovered that both Jacob and Sophia’s cancers were back.Liliane spoke about her agony in a Facebook post a few
days ago with a photo of her darling children hugging each other tightly as
they go through treatment in hospital."This is the most heartbreaking picture my eyes and
heart have every seen. I'm broken."We are all broken."This is not the life I imagined for them but it is
what it is and we will walk with them every step of the way," she wrote.On Tuesday, Liliane added this heart-rending post of
herself and her little girl in hospital:
