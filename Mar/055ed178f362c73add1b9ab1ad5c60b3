Upon investigation it was confirmed that the suspect, aged 76, passed away in April 2016. It was also confirmed with home affairs," said Mbhele.Mbhele said it was then concluded that the woman had opened the case "based on lies" and she was arrested for defeating the ends of justice, fraud and perjury."We would like to warn the members of the public to refrain from reporting false cases as this constitutes to crime and unnecessary abuse of the state resources," said acting provincial commissioner Major General Bheki Langa.Mbhele said the woman was expected to appear at the Durban Magistrate's Court on Friday.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/kzn-woman-arrested-for-opening-indecent-exposure-case-against-dead-man-20180316
