MAMELODI Sundowns assistant coach Manqoba Mngqithi feels pity for youngster Kelotso Makgwala.The talented 21-year-old Downs striker has been struggling for game-time.And the former Golden Arrows coach believes Makgwala could have already been a regular in the lineup if he was not playing for a big club like the seven-times Absa Premiership champions.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvg73pkSw09b7jBJbG4tcQnv8yoluBccYBDtQSLtWfoiuU3KQ9CSUqCXZXhbqAhqRG2U31mfJLKqxqXc-7daR1U5jsQ9_0DyPdr2vRO7ySxkXhtnkgAWWrHsDXId1mRbuY1chtPwQ8xWgNnwi_s3ezRKptRzPcdC1QHjA4411HyiTkQuZb6VsB5g18iiitXw31IQFouektKK1RZUSLkZUDfy3lfarL81VwyZLPA7CFhVZ5zuEEWr5uZHrJcxkDsmqR6YrhDEUYMDYJ0Cb2J\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKLheNkFTN4pEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It is a pity he is playing for big team like Sundowns. Those who have seen him play in the MDC (MultiChoice Diski Challenge) can tell you how talented he is.” Makgwala, who has been used mostly as a sub, is competing for a place with the likes of Anthony Laffor, Khama Billiat, Gaston Sirino, Thokozani Sekotlong Jeremy Brockie and Percy Tau. He joined Downs in 2014 and was promoted to the first team this season along with Thendo Mukumela.Sundowns could do well in loaning him to another PSL team next season so that he can grow and get regular game-time – much like they did with Tau. Tau, now the star of Downs and Bafana Bafana was loaned to National First Division team Witbank Spurs in 2015-16.He came back a more mature player and now has been tipped to win the PSL Player of the Season award.Makgwala was linked with a move to Ajax Cape Town or Chippa United in the January transfer window, but that move did not materialise.He was part of the national Under-20 squad that competed in the Fifa World Cup in South Korea last year.
