I thought I was defending myself and both of us were drunk when I stabbed him three times in the neck.His lawyer, Peter Malibe, told the court his client was still young to be sent to jail and he was also a first- time offender.The prosecutor, Matume Maakie, said the accused did not show any sign of remorse.The magistrate said the sentence imposed should be a warning to drunkards who misbehave after consuming alcohol.“The fact that you claim you were both drunk did not give you any right to kill him.“You should have reported the matter to the police instead of resorting to crime,” she said.
