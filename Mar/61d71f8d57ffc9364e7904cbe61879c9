There is no way a child of his age could have walked all the way there,” said Blessing.Councillor Sanele Thango said Sbonelo’s death was alarming as he was the third boy to be found dead in less than six months. “We have to start doing school awareness campaigns and warn our kids against strangers. I suspect someone is targeting our kids. The first boy was strangled. The second one was also found killed. Now, Sbonelo has been found floating in the river with a wound in his stomach.” Sbonelo’s uncle, Vusi Ndimande, refused to comment. He asked to be given space to mourn the tragic death of their loved one.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwanesaid: “An inquest docket was opened at Eshowe Police Station after the body of a missing boy was found floating in the river.”
