WILL Ajax Cape Town be vindicated or will they suffer the consequences of fielding Tendai Ndoro? The answer to this contentious matter will be revealed today when arbitrator Nassir Cassim SC hands down his ruling on the odd saga pitting the Premier Soccer League against its own Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC).The saga began when Orlando Pirates and Polokwane City lodged a protest with the PSL disciplinary committee, saying Ajax Cape Town contravened Fifa rules when they fielded Tendai Ndoro in league matches.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstpWr6pFFEWdslZIq6o-mQKxbWspvj3y9dJkPTVx9porUxyzDabHHZfGefVRfvueoSid9DaV9IArbIUc_FLnNhAObw0qEzZmwTQmR5I5VnwRUS_C5S2nr7pQr0_UssqG-Aiyep0o1HmiNWcpTPKmJv_zCDSuD2Ql1Wp4yIDKxxyeyWyVmd4CnnQBGjvbQ92JgCLaV_FHuqmu9vT156dNzktwHDEv7ZeLuKWTigcXLggdLeeBO2uqJ0cPCxW4vZtySeBkMgNt3uDd4FLvSrHhJ5otw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEkdhWpX_shGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

States article 5.3 of Fifa’s regulations: “Players may be registered with a maximum of three clubs during one season. During this period, the player is only eligible to play official matches for two clubs.“As an exception to this rule, a player moving between two clubs belonging to associations with overlapping seasons (that is, start of the season in summer/autumn as opposed to winter/spring) may be eligible to play in official matches for a third club during the relevant season, provided he has fully complied with his contractual obligations towards his previous clubs. “Equally, the provisions relating to the registration periods as well as to the minimum length of a contract must be respected.”The DRC ruled in January that the Cape side could field Ndoro.And it was on the basis of this ruling that the PSL disciplinary committee dismissed the clubs’ protests, explaining that Ndoro’s eligibility had already been ruled upon by the DRC.“In the circumstances, the disciplinary committee ruled that it lacked the necessary jurisdiction to hear the protests and they were both dismissed. The protesting clubs – Orlando Pirates FC and Polokwane City FC – were ordered to pay the costs of the hearing,” the PSL statement said.But the PSL has since appealed the DRC’s ruling.Cassim listened to arguments on Monday but reserved judgment and is expected to deliver a verdict on the matter today.Ndoro has already played seven league matches for the struggling Ajax and the earlier ruling about the protests means they will not forfeit the four points gained from those matches played under protest.The 23-year-old played against Pirates on 31 January and against City on 4 February.
