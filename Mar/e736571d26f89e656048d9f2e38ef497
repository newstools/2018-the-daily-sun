Added the Serb: “But our focus is totally on the City match. “We respect Benni, but we will see what standard is needed to match standards in Africa. “We definitely want to play in the Champions League and Confederation Cup, but for now we’re only thinking about the upcoming games.”However, Sredojevic insists that mental strength will be key to overcome the Citizens, who can be tough nuts to crack in their own backyard.“We need to be mentally strong because in a cup competition you are either in or out. We also need to be physically fit to stay in contention in the league – and this is the final before the final. “We want the players to be in a relaxed mood, to respect our opponents. We are fully aware of what could happen.” Although some Pirates players, including captain Happy Jele, have the flu, Sredojevic is not panicking.He said: “There is an outbreak of flu among players, Happy too. That has put us in the position of having to juggle players. We are ready to show the depth we have in the team.”Sredojevic hopes victory in Cape Town will be a remedy for fans who are still hurting after the club failed to win a single trophy last season.He said their results would act as a remedy to ease the stress that Bucs’ 12th man – the fans – have suffered in the past season. Pirates winger Thembinkosi Lorch hopes to continue with his scoring form, which saw him grab a goal in their 3-1 league win over fierce rivals Kaizer Chiefs a fortnight ago.Said Lorch: “We have good players like (Mpho) Makola, (Luvuyo) Memela and (Justin) Shonga. I will wait for my chance and I will use it.”
