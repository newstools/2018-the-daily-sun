THE TEACHERS haven't been paid for two years. They share the little money they have to pay for transport but they carry on teaching because they love pupils and they believe in their work. The frightening thing is that the department doesn't share the same passion! Year after year, Hoernle Primary School in Rockville produces excellent results. And the school produces pupils that parents can be proud of.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssoggtWKrfO79BaT4UtsdpZ8_d5IsMwnoP-Ane9Bf8R51TC7k_OGNmbjUiA5S6hV3X7W3tlaef-XjCkaFpxVTk8QK7eyeEpqx0Fcw788riyUViMWjXZMRuwZK2AhDWJTpsjBzxiTGFTr7rhPKeEPFmbNvfLZLjpTnTS29M0anOG7o1b6zZc6mQsvrgaM8vcUkvtIpiZCnC84d2h3migs3nd4gIt9wQyCpN86NVuwenSjH_BWqFoT6wRd_b-xLMuaqn91foZkLajf3gzzICNZeD5YcG6IOA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGdwLfBC9rItEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It’s taking a toll on our personal lives because we have families but these children are important to us,” she said.“The department is failing us even though they were ordered by the court to do the right thing for the school.”Mzimkhule Hlalukana, the school’s principal, said they have an income of R4 500 a month that they get from churches who rent space from them for services over the weekends.“We share that money among 17 of us so that we have some money for transport to get to work.” Hlalukana said the reason the school was suffering was because the Gauteng Department of Education wanted to close the school and merge it with another one due to the low number of pupils. But the merger has never taken place.“I’ve been to court three times and each time the court ruled in our favour. The court ordered that the education department reinstate the status of the school, provide food and stationery for the children and pay teachers.”But, according to Hlalukana, the department only provided food and stationery for the children. He told Daily Sun the parents did not want to move their kids to other schools because they were far away, but mostly because the children were happy and were getting good tuition.“We had a meeting with the SGB and parents asked us to keep the school open,” he said.“I’m willing to fight for these children. Why should they be forced to attend a school that would cost their parents transport money instead of one that is three minutes away?”A teacher at the school told the SunTeam they were still at the school because they are passionate about building future leaders. The teacher said the principal has paid with his own money to have the lawn mowed. “Hlalukana forked out R3 000 twice so the school would be neat. He doesn’t have any money left now and soon the school will look like a forest. We are not sure why they are so keen to close the school and are bullying us in the process.”Hlalukana told the People’s Paper that his finances were taking strain. “It’s becoming more difficult to maintain my daily needs, especially since I buried my wife in January. Now my son, who works at a call centre, helps with paying our bond. “If this is what we have to go through to provide education for the little ones, then so be it.”The department said that it was finalising the process to convert the school into an Early Childhood Development Centre.Gauteng Education Department spokesman Steve Mabona said they had complied with the court order and had paid accordingly.But he said unfortunately the school continued to be occupied and as such they were not obligated to pay any further compensation. The department will wait for the outcome of the court process on occupation because it was challenged by the parents and staff of the school.
