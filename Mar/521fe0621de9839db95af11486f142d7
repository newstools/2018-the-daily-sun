I’m proud of what I have done as a leader of my party caucus in the municipality. I think I have managed to hold the mayor Zandile Gumede and her executive accountable.” Mncwango said his move was in line with his party’s campaign to bring the ANC below 50% and govern the province through a coalition after the 2019 elections. Mncwango has taken over the position which was left vacant by DA member Mbali Ntuli, who is now the provincial head of the election campaign on a full-time basis. Mncwango was elected as party leader in the provincial congress last month. After his election he said he would make sure his party reduced the ANC’s majority to below 50%. He became a councillor in eThekwini in 2011 and was elected as party caucus leader the same year. He is expected to take over as party caucus leader in the legislature and said a new caucus leader in eThekwini will be announced soon.
