I have chosen to share my birthday with a room full of women to bask in their power and magic. On the night, we will create a Supernova: We will shine a thousand times brighter than the sun and our light will be seen for a billion years to come. Our coming together may even create new galaxies, new worlds,” said King Tha.“We are strengthening the sisterhood at KING THA DAY, everyone on stage will be a woman and all our vendors, the tech teams and venue staff will be women too. This is to help empower women in many of the fields connected to music, by giving them opportunities they wouldn’t normally have. This is a celebration of women, for us, by us. Where we cannot find a women to fill a certain position we commit to running internship programmes to one day fill those positions,” she continued.Tickets for King Tha Day are available at R250 from Quicket
