But he has accepted the club’s decision in good faith.“I have to be honest with you and the fans – I am sorry and ask forgiveness,” he said with a weak voice. “I am going to talk about myself only: I was wrong to do what I did. I made a mistake and I have learned from it. I am really hurt to leave Baroka in this fashion, as I love the club very much. “I should have acted like a true leader to other players, but I made a mistake. I blame myself for what happened and just have to pick up the pieces and continue to work hard to keep fit. “I would also like to apologies to the club, the fans and the management for my mistakes. I am sure this will help me grow up and be disciplined. The club made its decision and I accept it.”Shaku said he would work hard to make sure this did not destroy his career. “I will stay fit and hope God can give me a second chance in my football career,” he said. “I am a disciplined player, that was just a mistake. But I have to take responsibility for my actions. I am putting everything in God’s hands.” Shaku said he would not challenge his dismissal.“I just want to focus on my fitness and move on with my life,” he said. Masuluke was evasive yesterday when contacted for comment. The 24-year-old was the talk of South African and even world football after scoring a world class overhead goal against Orlando Pirates last season, voted among the top three at the 2017 Fifa Puskas Awards.Unfortunately, Masuluke came second, with striker Olivier Giroud, now with Chelsea, taking the award.Like this story?
