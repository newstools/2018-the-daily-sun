It should be an interesting race. This is a good series. We’ve never had a series that brings so many international athletes to the country and so much exposure for the local athletes. “The series boosts the sport itself as it allows us to compete at home in front of our home fans.”The series, which boasts a whopping R1 365 000 in prize money, has already been widely praised and is expected to attract thousands of spectators. The Grand Prix kicks off in Joburg tonight, with the Tshwane meeting on 8 March next, before the series concludes with the last event in Paarl on 22 March.Munyai reckons the series will serve as good preparation for the next SA Championships and the Commonwealth Games in Australia in April.He said: “With such quality athletes competing in the series you can perform better, which then helps you perform better in bigger championships like in the SA Champs or international races. I’m looking forward to it.”The 20-year-old initially set a personal best of 10.20 seconds in the 100m, which was close to matching Akani Simbine’s national junior record of 10.19 seconds. He was also included in the Rio Olympics team as one of three youngsters who travelled to Brazil to gain experience, but was disqualified for a lane violation at the 2017 World Championships in London.He put in fine performances at the AGN Provincial Championships, beating Jobodwana as he improved his 100m personal best time to 10:10sec.Jobodwana, on the other hand, has no ambition to win, but aims to execute his 200m race well to fine-tune himself for the Commonwealth, following his physical and psychological recovery.World Championships 10 000m silver medallist Joshua Cheptegei will headline the 1 500m, where he will come up against the South African contingent of Jerry Motsau, Folavio Sehole, national champion Dumisang Hlaselo and rising star Ryan Mphahlele. Like this story?
