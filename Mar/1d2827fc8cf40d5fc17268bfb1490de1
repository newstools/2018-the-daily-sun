Although the two have long tried to keep their relationship under wraps, they believed it was time for them to own it. Thandeka said lobola negotiations started in 2016 and everything was finalised last year. They plan to get married soon.“I cannot wait for the day when I say ‘I do’ to the man I will spend the rest of my life with,” she said. When the SunTeam asked Thandeka why they had kept their relationship a secret, she said: “We were not keeping it a secret but respected our jobs as artists. “We didn’t want people to focus on us as a couple. “We wanted them to know us as individual artists.” She said she hoped everything would go well and that their baby would grow up in a loving home with both parents. Thandeka’s partner Sabelo, who is her Afro-Soul music group co-member, said he was looking forward to being a husband and father. “All Thandeka said was true. “I believe she will make a good mum and wife,” he said.
