southbound lanes converted into dual carriageway. This detour is anticipated to
be in effect for the foreseeable future," the provincial department said
in a statement.The Laudium Disaster Management group posted on their
Facebook page: "A meeting is being planned at 9:30am this morning between
Councillor Essop and various members of the MEC for Roads Office, Geologists,
relevant traffic engineers and law enforcement."On Monday theÂ  local
Councillor Essop, shared the same sentiment as the community, that Laudium
should not be used as a thoroughfare. They then came to a conclusion that the converting a portion
of the R55 southbound as a bi-directional single lane road, with concrete
barriers was the best solution.
