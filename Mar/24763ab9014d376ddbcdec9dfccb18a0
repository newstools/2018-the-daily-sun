Every time I drive by on this tarred road they stop me and demand money. “It’s like I’m the government who employed them to fix potholes on this road. “I always shout at them and tell them to get lost but they never listen. I fear for their lives as well. Some crazy motorist is going to drive over them.” The SunTeam drove by the tarred road on Tuesday and found the boys with their road sign, collecting soil from the road side to fill the gaping potholes. One of the boys told Daily Sun they came up with the plan to make pocket money for school in January this year. “Some good motorists stop and give us, but others shout at us and drive by without giving us a cent.” Asked if they knew it was dangerous to stand in the middle of the road when cars were passing by, Xichavo said: “When we realise that a car isn’t going to stop, we move out of the way.” They vowed to continue despite the risk.One of the boys’ mum, Tsako Maluleke (42) told Daily Sun they were not aware that the boys had been risking their lives fixing potholes and said they would make sure the boys don’t go near the road again. Spokesman for the Limpopo roads and transport department, Matome Moremi, discouraged the kids from risking their lives in such a manner. “We appeal to the parents to monitor their kids and stop them from playing on the road.” Matome added that community members could report potholes to the Department of Public Works.
