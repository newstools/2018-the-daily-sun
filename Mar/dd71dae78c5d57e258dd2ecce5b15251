He said they fought a lot over the fact that he spent most of his time in Mpumalanga, where he worked as a bus driver for a mining company. Jacobeth told Daily Sun: “He is dishonest and a serial cheater.“Whenever he goes to work, he gets a girlfriend and engages in sexual activities. Several times I have found condoms in his pockets.” Jacobeth said Abel often came home after midnight or even as late as dawn. “Even if I needed him, he would push me away and face the other side of the bed,” she said. An attorney said it is unlikely that divorce could happen without a partner being issued a decree of divorce. He said once a divorce had been completed by the court, it’s a long process to undo.
