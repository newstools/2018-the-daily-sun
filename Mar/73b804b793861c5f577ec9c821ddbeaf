Weather WarningsAt home, you can leave checking the weather until the very second before stepping out, but it will be a lot harder to navigate that with just a suitcase or backpack worth of clothing items and dreams on you. Instead, you should check weather reports so that you know in advance what type of clothing items to pack in. Waiting until the day before you'll fly is too late.If you're travelling to a Caribbean destination, check for storms on the various platforms available ahead of time so that you can make other arrangements if need be – before everyone else tries to do the same thing and the airline runs out of available seats.Some helpful sites to check for weather and potential storms are: National Hurricane Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), Cyclocane or Accuweather.Airlines are usually good about waiving change fees in such cases, but it's always better to make changes sooner. It might be useful to note when the hurricane seasons spike up in certain areas.For instance: The Atlantic hurricane season runs 1 June to 30 November; the Pacific season for cyclones typically starts a little earlier (15 May) and also ends at the end of November. The last two years extreme weather has shut down major airports multiple times, so it's better to know when things might get a bit cloudy or rainy on your travel parade.iStockSEE: Euro-tripping: Travel Squad Wanted2.

Health WarningsAlways check the health and disease issues being experienced in your holiday destination location to avoid having your vacay clouded by a deadly disease like Malaria or Zika. We tend to focus on looking up the special attractions and natural wonders of countries we plan to visit but we rarely seek out health information about our destinations. Make a quick visit to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website and look for the Travellers' Health section to see which countries are currently experiencing malaria or rabies outbreaks, and which islands are coping with ongoing threats from the Zika virus.The good news is that the CDC provides a wealth of useful information on how to protect yourself from such things, including specific precautions to take and where to find medical clinics when away from home.Some diseases travellers should know about include:Zika Virus - is spread between people through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito.Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) - a viral respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Camels are a likely source of infection for people.Ebola - this extremely severe and often fatal condition can be spread from wild animals (fruit bats are said to be the disease's natural host) to people. It can also spread between people through exposure or direct contact with the blood, organs, secretions of an infected person or through the use of unsterilised tools like needles. Chikungunya Virus - is spread between people through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito.Measles - humans are the only host for this disease and its spread through droplets from the nose or oropharynx. Polio - it can be transmitted through a faecal-oral or oral-oral route. Cholera - this intestinal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae and is spread through ingesting faecal or vomit contaminated food or water.Avian Flu - also known as bird flu - is not as common in humans, but rare cases have been contracted through direct or close contact with infected poultry or eating raw or undercooked meat, eggs or blood from infected birds. Tuberculosis - this disease mainly affects the lungs, but it can also involve the kidneys, brain, spine and other organs. This is an airborne disease and can be spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings. Malaria - is spread between people through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. Sometimes infection occurs through blood transfusions, organ transplantation, needle sharing and congenital transmission. Yellow Fever - is transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes or Haemagogus mosquito. It gives some infected people jaundice - hence its title of Yellow Fever. Typhoid Fever - this disease is transmitted through contaminated food or water. It moves from the intestines to the bloodstream then to other parts of the body including: the lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver and spleen. Dengue - is a febrile illness spread through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. iStockREAD: SA Budget Travel: Explore the world with these simple financial steps4. Airline Warnings:Nothing quite puts a damper on a vacay than rushing to the airport only to have to wait a few more hours for your delayed flight or missing it altogether!When you check in for your flight the night before or the morning of - check if any changes have occurred to your flight details. Also check again and again - never stop checking, because changes happen all of the time. Until your butt is buckled down to the seat - it's all up in the air.If you haven’t already done so, check to be certain that your airline has your contact information so they can email or text you in the event of delays or cancellations. You might be surprised at how disruptive an unexpected hurricane or tsunami can be.Winter storms can be terrible, too, of course, but so can unexpected events like erupting volcanoes. Always be sure to check with the airline from time to time to see what's new or changed, and double check that these airline emails don't go directly to trash or spam.
