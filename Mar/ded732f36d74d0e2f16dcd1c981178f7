It’s in a bad condition. “I don’t have money to build us a better house,” said Zethu.She said they struggled even with groceries because the social grant for the girls was not enough. “Food is expensive. The R800 we get is not enough to buy us food for the whole month. The first two weeks of the month are usually okay but the last two are hard.” Councillor Johnson Gwala said he is aware of the situation. “It is a challenging situation because their mother didn’t register for an RDP.”He said he was planning to ask business people for donations to help the family.KZN Social Development spokeswoman Ncumisa Ndelu said: “I advise her to visit her nearest Sassa office. “Officials will take her through the application process for foster grants,” said Ndelu.
