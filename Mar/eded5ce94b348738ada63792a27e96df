GAUTENG Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa made a surprise visit to Tambo Memorial Hospital yesterday.  When she arrived at the hospital in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, some patients were waiting on benches and others were lying on the floor. They told the MEC they had arrived at the hospital on Saturday night but had still not been seen by yesterday morning. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>When Ramokgopa asked a man why he was sleeping on the floor, he told her he was waiting for a doctor to see him. He was taken to a bed after the MEC instructed nurses to help him. The patient’s brother said he was stabbed in the face on Saturday. “Two guys were fighting and he was standing next to them,” he said. He said he didn’t know why it happened but one of the guys broke a bottle and stabbed his brother. “My brother has been in a lot of pain. He decided to sleep on the floor because he could not sit on the bench any more.” The MEC said the man told her a doctor had briefly examined him but was waiting for further assessment. She said it wasn’t right for him to be sleeping on the floor while nurses ignored him. However, the MEC acknowledged that there was a problem of overcrowding at the hospital. “We went in and saw that every bed was occupied. We can see that demand is very high but nurses must walk around monitoring patients who are waiting for further assessment.,” she said. When the MEC tried to get hold of the doctor who was supposed to be on duty, she found he was not at the hospital.
