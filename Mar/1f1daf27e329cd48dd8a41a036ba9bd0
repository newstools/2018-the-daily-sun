President Cyril Ramaphosa has urged all South Africans to go out and register to vote for the "important" 2019 national elections."We will be going to door-to-door asking our people to vote, asking our people to go and register because the next elections are going to be very, very important," Ramaphosa said. Ramaphosa took his healthy lifestyle campaign to Soweto, leading a 5km walk on Saturday morning, starting at the historic Regina Mundi Church, with hundreds of people which started promptly at 06:00.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstk-eRltUNEjvduIdHduU131NObONmlXS0SXC2JkzphETE4qbc_rBK70U0_VJzUDJeMMWDPd69v7WJ4BnLzk_UYhM-8mNPQBohC_HqmWZB-VL2R1bjx3au4T0L0LwaUHxn2q_qLl3_NygI2foxzh8hRzQJjeoxZXujgEq0JjjpYr5VJqrM3BBUKxruDH0eIlk6G03gO9UnBBRJpk7lM3X5gF5XxV5qoYYBh_XFoDgJg3SYqKYF0e6OPLHJtZKwsKdPL-Vqsaetjpgu849OtP5Rw8KqO6N4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFdQPBh6YhdIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Job creation and rooting out corruption would be his priorities, he added."Day and night, I as president worry about jobs. I want every one of our companies to go on a job creation drive as we are going to grow this economy to make sure that we create jobs."And we make sure that our government works for the people and no other family, no other individual, whether their name starts with a G or whatever," he said.Ramaphosa also decried the dirty streets in the township, urging all South Africans to clean their communities. He said government would embark on a national campaign to clean places where people live, similar to Rwanda - which is considered one of the cleanest countries on the continent.In Rwanda, on the last Saturday of the month, residents between the ages of 18 and 65 come to the city to participate in what is called Umuganda, which roughly translated means "coming together in common purpose to achieve an outcome".According to Rwandapedia, residents then take part in various community work initiatives including cleaning the city and helping to build schools and medical centres to name a few."The time has come for us as South Africans to live a healthy lifestyle but also to clean the places where we live, because when you have a healthy lifestyle and you clean the places where you live it opens up your mind and your head," Ramaphosa said.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ramaphosa-takes-morning-walk-in-soweto-urges-people-to-register-to-vote-20180310
