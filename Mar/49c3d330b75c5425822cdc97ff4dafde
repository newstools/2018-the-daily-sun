van to collect her body. Other [landfill] site employees helped me to build a
shack. I had to protect her body from the heat."In the afternoon, it started to rain. I was still
standing, waiting for help. The morgue van arrived about 22:00. It was the
worst experience ever. She was my older sister. Seeing her helpless body lying
on the dump for hours tarnished me. I could not leave her."Sweet personNswaki, of Lesotho, was 56 years old. She had been working
as a waste picker on the landfill site since 2015. She lived in Swapo informal
settlement."Both of us were waste pickers. We walked together to
work. We collected cupboards, bottles and plastic containers," her brother
said."Every month we would go and sell to companies in town.
It was not much, but we paid rent and bought food. We were able to make R1 000,
depending on how much waste we collected. We sold our items once every
month."Delani Mndaweni, who lived with Nswaki, described her as a
sweet person."She was very cautious around the compactor. Some waste
pickers would jump on the compactor. She never did that. I don't understand how
she was killed by this thing. The driver must answer for how this happened. The
Nswaki I know would not even get close to the compactor. She was scared of
it," said Mndaweni.Mloyi said his sister's body would be transported to Lesotho
on Friday."A driver from Lesotho wanted R9 000 or a cow. I have
managed to get a driver who asked for R3 000," Mloyi said.Msunduzi municipality spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said
Mahlakwane was accidentally knocked over."The matter was reported to SAPS and emergency
services. The operator, as well as other waste pickers, were attended to. They
received counselling," said Mafumbatha.Pietermaritzburg police communication officer Mthokozisi
Ngobese said an inquest has been opened.Colonel Thulani Zwane added that a case of culpable homicide
was under investigation at Alexandra police station.SOURCE: NEWS24
