She said her boss called her to his office despite the fact that she got permission to go to the clinic from a manager the previous day.“I explained to him I had to collect treatment because I’m HIV-positive. “He started yelling and asked me why I hadn’t informed him before he hired me,” she said. “He said he couldn’t work with people who were sick, especially with HIV, as they would spit blood into the chickens and infect customers and staff.” The woman said she was diagnosed nearly eight months ago. Store owner Shuaib Mohamed said he would talk to the woman’s boss but he doubted she was fired for being sick. “We don’t discriminate for any reason but it’s important for staff to pull their weight and serve customers, especially during the probation period.” CCMA CEO Cameron Morajane said it was unacceptable to dismiss someone for being HIV-positive and the woman had 30 days to lodge a formal complaint.
