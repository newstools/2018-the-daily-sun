And then knowing that when they fight back you'll open up cases and saying that they abuse you, guess what? You're going nowhere slowly”, he said in a video he posted on Instagram.The troublesome students can thank their lucky stars the Akulalwa hit maker is not a teacher, or else they would have found themselves on the end of the famous Dr Malinga Kick.“If I was a teacher, you were going to see sh***, I would kick you right on your chin” Dear Student stop beating up our teachers pls,if i was teacher i dare you shem.A post shared by  Dr Malinga (@drmalinga) on Mar 13, 2018 at 12:22am PDT
