REGULAR Daily Sun and Sunday Sun readers had lunch with the newspapers’ managers on Thursday. The event, which took place at the Media24 offices in Joburg, gave readers the chance to ask questions about the content of the newspapers. Reader Elson Chauke wanted to know why most Sunday Sun stories were not posted online as he sometimes found it difficult to find a copy of the newspaper. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsttdrzv4I2jNfitUAiliUatj85OwD3vnd9QUGNgg36BYz4DXXylhoLAQI9wobug2xBbrPQCaipr-LwceOc2tBksuKMnLm3VWt5SPdoI41mJO1-kT9fuFUDTJnRsoBBgqjyrxYoize0AY_X8NdSyKKdFDjaIVEy3MJG7jZ_We72Qb5QIgP6MRmzIfPtHMq4uHWSOdyHdgxA2Sk5M9kZxgUFkfHet9wf5QtyWom8TvlfsmhT2RDJ-V8nt-5Df8kIVKs86tCKLJaVLM3hDff4pP1TQSD9eycQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJTNeRrj30sQEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He said online content did not bring in money and the income generated from sales of hard copies kept the two newspapers in business. Speaking about the letters page, the readers and management decided it would not be a good idea to have a letter of the year as it would create controversy. One of the readers asked why Daily Sun often had bizarre posters and gave “Man Kills Himself And Runs Away” as an example. Daily Sun editor Reggy Moalusi said that particular poster was created by social media users. “We found the poster funny but it was not real,” he said. He said posters are based on stories in the newspaper. Slight Ramphaka was pleased to find out why letters were often shortened when they appear in the paper. That is because there is not much space on a page and the letters have to be cut to fit. He said he also enjoyed getting a chance to meet other letter writers.
