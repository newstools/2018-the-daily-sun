“GIVE us back our money now!”  These were the words of angry customers who returned cold meat to the Enterprise factory shop in Germiston, Ekurhuleni yesterday. This came after Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi on Sunday warned people not to eat cold meat. He said the Listeria bacteria had been traced to an Enterprise Foods facility in Polokwane, Limpopo. Tiger Brands, which owns Enterprise Foods, has since announced that it will recall all Enterprise products and assured customers they would be refunded. Barely 24 hours after the announcement was made, frustrated consumers flocked to the Enterprise factory in Germiston. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssry4eTbM6vJE8lKF9Q9Al6Mo8dbBAYAm3UUfWzLOsVSTHmnJOrP7xnSYOUEOEqkKAV7y2D6jenY_FzlhmmOkna9HyyJak8ZaAIj0c59nwL7o6LpuuQiQj4MOICV5WmPoL-2W5RxfApQhhyrKweH1d7TZlu7FYQUqQc1P_lMiAaARPYa5P03dgLmC62MD1bZ6uPFU3LSdYXkRL6IGGVWSLoG8Z6rjYKBGHkjFGwyUeBUxYYhfJfpO3DmetwgrAdRPUR0NMyD4sHtVpvksd_eXhkMIMqWNQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMkIIKJ4zvqgEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I buy the hamper every month for my kids.”Tebogo Ramohlale said her husband became sick on Friday after eating polony, a vienna and a Russian. She said she would not eat cold meat any more. In Polokwane, customers stood outside the closed Enterprise factory shop with plastic bags full of meat, demanding to speak to the manager. Rasethaba Seipei, a businessman from Polokwane, said he made R4 000 a day from selling kotas, which he would now lose. Kate Mokgobu from Seshego said she was happy the company was giving refunds, but her family would no longer eat processed meat. Shop manager David Van der Berg said: “We don’t have enough money at the shop to give refunds, as we do our banking on Saturdays but we will be able to give refunds tomorrow.”
