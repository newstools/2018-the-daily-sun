INDICATIONS are that the left hand doesn’t always know what the right is doing at Kaizer Chiefs.While defender Daniel Cardoso blames strikers for all the missed opportunities that have affected Amakhosi’s title aspirations, striker Bernard Parker disagrees.Chiefs have yet to win silverware under coach Steve Komphela, and the Nedbank Cup is their last hope.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvjBWIGb3lWKcRHrhZpSge52FUq6itQud8KJlLqNXCbCbYEUYdSp798jpVctiEkGkKePTM2TJeF6j5N8mGusq_mLcdetSYAFLIRYVjlSMIojF7N1J-KADGsW6QEgwxZ8QtQ35X9PD2FiwraU61w4MmNXjHaK7Y2mSahhFDy-J6rnOB0gmf_C_zK6MXp0BhU4rNjJjqHlBsycC_KO-ahtYwUIpbNc8pr9yjpioaJdP1xoNXOTA0cGpYBGwov8wZYQG2joMPBEOKBgkWcFWa8rZMMbw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCoLp6TjBHy6EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We conceded three goals against Pirates, that was a blow for us. It was the first time we conceded three in quite a while. “We’ve done a bit of defensive work at training. Also, scoring goals has been a problem, especially in the final third. It has haunted us in the past – we don’t score goals and the opposition gets a late equaliser, or we draw 0-0 because we haven’t taken our chances.”Parker explains: “I am one of the seniors in the attacking squad. Daniel says scoring is a problem for us, but I don’t think it is. We are all goal-scorers here. As you’ve seen, (Ryan) Moon is also scoring, Parker is a natural goal-scorer. (Leonardo) Castro – where he has been (Mamelodi Sundowns) proves he can score goals. It’s just for us to work on that link between the supplier and the finisher.”Despite disagreeing on this matter, both players are focused on helping Amakhosi win the Ke Yona trophy for Komphela.Said Parker: “We are all aware that this has been a bad year. It’s also the last couple of months for our coach. He hasn’t won anything yet. This is a chance to get a trophy for the club and add to his career. We owe the club some silverware. “For us as players this is the most important time of our lives where we need to turn our focus, energy and thoughts to getting silverware.”Cardoso chipped in: “The focus is on Nedbank now. Hopefully we will go through to the final.”However, the two know it won’t be an easy task to overcome the National First Division side. “We know what our opponents are all about. They play a similar system of 3-4-3 or 3-5-2, and they play with a lot of energy. Playing Chiefs is a confidence boost for them and we can get hurt if we are not in the right frame of mind,” added Parker.
