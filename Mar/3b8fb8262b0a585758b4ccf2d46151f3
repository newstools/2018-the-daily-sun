by new President Cyril Ramaphosa to provide the details after having considered
the court approach."We are instructed to inform you that since
May 1, 2009 an amount of R15 300 250 was incurred by the Presidency on legal
costs pertaining to the National Prosecuting Authority's decision to decline to
prosecute former president Zuma on charges of fraud, corruption and
racketeering."Ramaphosa will convey the information to the
National Assembly in due course, the letter said.Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema is
to ask Ramaphosa, during his first question session on Wednesday, how much Zuma
spent on all legal costs during his nine years as president.Zuma must pay back the moneyMaimane said Zuma was now liable to pay back the
money, because the spy tapes case was against him in his personal capacity, and
before he was president."He [Zuma] was not a respondent in that case in
his capacity as president of the Republic of South Africa."As such, this amounts to R15.3m of irregular
spending by the government to keep Jacob Zuma out of jail."Therefore, Jacob Zuma must personally pay
back this money. The DA has consulted our legal team and begun the legal
process of retrieving every cent of this R15.3m from Jacob Zuma."Maimane also called on Ramaphosa to join their
legal action to recover the money from Zuma."The new president cannot talk tough on
corruption and wasteful spending, yet turn a blind eye to this blatant abuse of
public funds by Jacob Zuma."We will retrieve the people's money from
Jacob Zuma, and he will eventually have his day in court and will have to
answer to the 783 counts of fraud, corruption, money-laundering and
racketeering against him."Malema's question also asked on what basis the
State Attorney's office justified its spending on Zuma's cases.Ramaphosa is due before the House at 15:00 on
Wednesday to answer Malema's and five other questions during his maiden
question session as president.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zuma-spent-r153m-in-court-on-spy-tapes-saga-state-attorney-20180313
