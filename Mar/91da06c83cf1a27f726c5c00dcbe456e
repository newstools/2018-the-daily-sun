So we were surprised on Monday when we saw it continuing.“We enquired and discovered that the municipality told the contractor to continue working and said they would provide security guards in case we tried to stop the project again,” he said.Siphiwe said they are angry because hiring guards shows that the municipality has money, but they are refusing to hire them. Municipal spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said: “We have a vacancy task team within the human resources unit which monitors the filling of vacant posts. “People are free to exercise their constitutional rights but they should do so in a peaceful and legal manner.”Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane says police are monitoring the situation.
