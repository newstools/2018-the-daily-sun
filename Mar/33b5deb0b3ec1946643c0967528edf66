VUYANI Mazibuko isn’t like other hawkers selling cakes on the streets. This is because the 26-year-old from Phola Park kasi in Mangaung wears suits and ties when he goes out to sell his products on the busy OR Tambo Street in Bloemfontein. Vuyani’s snappy outfits have made him very popular and motorists sometimes give him money even when they don’t want cake. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvBdYwBWf8HQSk54PPh8sQy9ubT_xNHWSn9YRUf34xty0UYYVd8k_U3-UZgNbf52m9n2qdxVIL7jN6fmGeEe5nPBPIAhxbEB2kefef4Y83ZqPNVck8tMn9xpkSQm6YA-UfWrHCyHErV2gxNFu5uTceEHNrCGlKO-c_G6dneaPU7-s4WB0NYeVM2s7XD3Xqs-zjdvUxg_cuAUJLDY7XOiGG8JmhzrY_l_g5uKpLQtBmL3n2XjY87udAifm-bB5hXpPEuTagCNJJWx29rPMISWLsrQRcDrhk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzICzbBPbocGSEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He said he took over the baking business from his mum, who started it in 2013. “I took over this business from my mum in 2015,” he said. “I have always believed that looking good and having a smile on your face will bring good results. “I’m the breadwinner and I support my family of five. My clothes catch the eye and this means people buy me before they buy my cakes. “I have received a lot of donations from motorists who love my clothing. They say I look very good.” Vuyani said his goal was to open his own bakery so he could supply cakes to big supermarkets. One of his customers, taxi driver Sello Mpene (33) said: “I have been buying cakes from this young, tidy man since last year. When I’m off, I also come to buy for my son.” Mpolokeng Saila (44) said Vuyani was fashionable, like Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba. “He doesn’t look like he’s selling cakes in the street,” said Mpolokeng. Vuyani sells one packet of cakes for R7 and he has many customers.
