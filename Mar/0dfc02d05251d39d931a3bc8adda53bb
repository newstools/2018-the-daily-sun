Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said they believed there was a gang operating in the area as food was also stolen from Flavius Mareka Secondary School on Tuesday. “We urge residents to provide us with information that might help bring the culprits to book,” he said. Meanwhile, Phuthaditjhaba primary and Phelindaba secondary schools are struggling with overcrowding, broken chairs, tables, windows and ceilings. There have been three burglaries at Phelindaba this year, where laptops, computers and four smart boards worth over R400 000 were taken. The school has 33 teachers and 1 250 pupils and there is a shortage of textbooks. Gauteng DA shadow MEC for education Khume Ramulifho said it was only going to get worse.“The infrastructure budget has been slashed by almost R500 million as a result of the department’s failure to spend its allocated budget,” he said. Captain Thomas Mufamadi said cases of business burglary and robbery were opened, but no arrests had been made.
