lying about the house in an interview with Drum magazine where she said “I‘m
very upset at him for doing that. He lied – the apartment is a rental. He told
Fresh he bought it and he went onto the breakfast show to speak about it and
it’s not true. Lasizwe replied by saying that the house does belong to him but
was bought by his boyfried Marcus and is not yet transferred to his name.Marah Louw is
left fuming after she was apparently offered a per-call contract on popular
soapie The Queen, which she labelled "insulting and disrespectful" to
her decades of experience in the industry. The drama unravelled after Shona Ferguson told
Sunday Sun that Marah was not fired from the show but was in and out of
contract. Marah however rubbished the claims and brought files to prove that
she did not leave, but her contract was apparently terminated by the show's
creators.Pearl Thusi found her self in hot water after she did a blackface
photoshoot and one of the people who was not very pleased was Bonnie MbuliMbuli labelled the shoot distasteful and went on to
add that it does no matter who rocks it, it does not look cute at all.  Pearl Thusi remains unshaken with no need to
defend herself for the images
