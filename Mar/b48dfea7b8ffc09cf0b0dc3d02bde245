If it’s a tactical or a slow race you need to know what to do,” he told SunSport.Cheptegei also encouraged local runners to train in groups.He insisted: “Team work makes a difference. You won’t achieve anything alone.“You need to learn to train with partners and help each other succeed,” he advised.Manangoi said: “South African runners have to be strong to have that little mileage.“They have to train with champions and run with champions.“I don’t fear any race because I also train with champions and run with champion.“I train with my elder brother Elijah Manangoi, who is the world champion.”Like this story?
