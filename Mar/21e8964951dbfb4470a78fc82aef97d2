Why the support has declined?” asked people on social media.Daily Sun spoke to Mcebo, who sounded unconcerned about the dwindling numbers.“I’m not worried. In fact, we stopped informing students about my appearances,” he said.He said the situation now was different than before, when he made his first appearances. “Back then, school had been suspended. Coming to court was also part of the protest.”He said now the situation has gone back to normal and they don’t want to disturb that. “We don’t want students to abandon classes and come to court,” he said. But he said he was still getting support from his peers, family and members of the public in general.“Messages of support come every now and then. That alone is huge,” he said. He said what made him happy was that their fight was not in vain. “I smile when I see first-year students on campuses. These students couldn’t be there because they couldn’t afford fees.”Social media has been pressing for charges again Mcebo to be dropped.He said he also wanted them to be dropped because he feels they were just politically motivated. Mcebo said he was going to trial on 30 and 31st July.“I believe everything will be just fine. I trust my legal team,” he said. referring to the Primera División which is the top professional association football division of the Spanish football league system.  He said Fees Must Fall activists were hoping that President Cyril Ramaphosa was the president, this the case will finally be dealt with.
