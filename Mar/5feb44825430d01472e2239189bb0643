We must have them going into development structures,” said Khoza.“The development structures need the most qualified ex-players and not ‘just-by-the-way’ coaches. In the Netherlands, for instance, you have (Marc) Overmars and (Patrick) Kluiverts in the development structures. “You need someone with the patience to nurture and develop talent. “Our ex-players can’t all be analysts. They must come and plough back into football.“That is how we are going to grow our football. As a brand the PSL is No 1 on the continent. But we must be the No 1 brand on and off the field. “We’ve seen the likes of Percy Tau and Siphesihle Ndlovu coming out of this (MDC) tournament.”The competition splits the 16 clubs into four regional pools, namely the Central, Coastal West, Coastal East and Northern pool. Each has four teams vying for the regional championship, with the winner progressing to the semifinals and later the final. The eventual winners will receive a trophy and R150 000 contribution towards a football development initiative for a local community of their choice. Khoza stressed the tournament was not corporate social investment but a serious project to improve the quality of the sport and product of PSL football.MultiChoice CEO Calvo Mawela said: “We value our partnership with the PSL, which has now spanned over a decade. We believe it has made a significant contribution to the development and growth of football in South Africa. “The Diski Shield will further contribute to the development of young players, to get them ready to take their spot in senior teams.”Like this story?
