the bodies of two children, believed to be aged between 6 and 8, lying near the
taxi. Assessments showed that both children had sustained numerous injuries and
showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for them and they
were declared dead," ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said.Paramedics assessed the patients and found that
they had sustained moderate injuries, they were then treated and thereafter
transported to nearby hospitals for further treatment.
