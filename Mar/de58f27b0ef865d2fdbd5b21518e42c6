Baroka are currently seventh in the table with 32 points from 24 matches, equal on points with eighth-placed Bloemfontein Celtic and two ahead of ninth-placed Chippa United.“Yes, we have signed him,” said Mammila. “We have been looking at him for long and he is impressive. So we are confident that he will add value to the team.” Chipezeze will not be able to play immediately. He will have to wait until the end of the season to be registered with the league and will only be playing league matches for them in the 2018-19 season.Meanwhile, Baroka are optimistic of victory in their upcoming clash with Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals at FNB Stadium on Saturday (8.15pm).This is the tournament that made Baroka famous back in 2011 when they reached the semifinals after defeating Absa Premiership giants including Chiefs and Moroka Swallows. And their interim coach, MacDonald Makhubedu, says they will treat Amakhosi like any other team in the PSL.“It is true, Chiefs are a big team and they have big players like Itumeleng Khune and many others,” the coach said. “But we play in the same league and we also have big name players. To us this is not a big match, it is just another game against a fellow-PSL team. We are going to the game to fight for a positive result and a place in the semifinals. “The players are not overexcited about the Chiefs clash – they approach it like any other game.” Makhubedu, who took over the helm after the club parted ways with previous head coach Kgoloko Thobejane, also mentioned that they would start preparations for this clash tomorrow, as most of their players were called up by their respective national teams during this Fifa international break.
