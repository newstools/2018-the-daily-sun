This was just a reminder that ‘Major, your hard work has been recognised’. “But I wouldn’t have achieved this if not for the support of my teammates. Football is a team sport, not an individual sport like tennis.”However, Majoro is aware that he faces pressure to increase his scoring tally of six goals if Wits are to qualify for the MTN8 Cup. “I have always scored for each team I’ve played for in the PSL. Wherever I go there is always pressure, regardless which team I’m playing for. “The most important thing to do is to manage it, and if you do that, you’ll enjoy your football. It is important to me to always perform, every time I am given the opportunity to play, and to never take my job for granted.” Wits still have a chance to restore their pride in continental competition, as they have now dropped down to the Caf Confederation Cup, where the draw is scheduled for tomorrow.Said Hunt: “I am lucky to be sitting here because we’ve had a bad start. But we can finish in a respectable position.”
