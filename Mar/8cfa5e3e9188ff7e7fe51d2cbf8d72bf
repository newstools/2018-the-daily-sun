Controversial musician and dancer Skolopad, wowed a lot of fans on social with her rendition of a gospel song.Skolopad is not known for her singing so it can be understood why some might have been dreading what was about to come out of her mouth just as she was preparing to give the rendition.However, even her taughest critics would have had a difficult time trying to find anything bad to say about her vocal skills.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst9qk1ghJwkzBEQRGyhn8mFLbMmSKtSATFx7G7QYQEfRg_BGE9J2ybAfq82r4tZX0xLZrAroGt5ZtXj4r0GK9VJku5AC2k08F6IjsvMKxlbU-F9F4mHi8ypNbvnAxO8bdk5JYrq7EI8cMMr-nTMud2zFb3ZWZ45lkftG7iqDmGAry3LTCHouesCRz_2hKTKR9sG61VTUCci6CNF6x1ADpgWmHDm6G-3jtluQOmegaGduRjt4C4bqHmNQqwEnbMAWgdnZ8cVAAVevm7E2NleuKgnOac0V_8CiS_wNQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEVIi97pRycvEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
