They didn’t want to hear us and started shooting and beating us.” He said the land they are occupying belongs to the people. “I’ll open a case against them,” he said.John Nkosi said they had a right to build shacks in open spaces. “We decided to build on the soil, just like those in big mansions,” said John (33).“Police have no right to chase us.
