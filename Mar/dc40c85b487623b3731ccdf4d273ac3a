Only seven points separate City from bottom club Platinum Stars. They are tied with second bottom Ajax Cape Town on 24 points, but Rise and Shine have two games in hand.Said Nienov: “We are expecting a difficult game, as Celtic have quality players like Ndumiso Mabena, Patrick Tignyemb and Lorenzo Gordinho, and a good coach (Veselin Jelusic). The fact that they are also fighting for a top eight spot will make this game more interesting. I think any team that gets 32 points will be 100% safe from relegation, but we are looking beyond that.”Nienov insisted that their players would up their game to avoid another stalemate, having drawn six matches this year. The last time Polokwane registered a win was on 6 January when they defeated Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns 3-2.Explained Nienov: “We have played too many draws (12) this season, which is not good. But it’s not only us – Chippa United (12), Golden Arrows (12) and Kaizer Chiefs (11) have also drawn a lot. This shows that the PSL is more competitive this season, it’s more difficult to win matches.“The team that makes the fewest mistakes wins and we need to follow suit. We need to be more compact, play as a unit and concentrate for the entire match.” Polokwane will pin their hopes on the league’s top scorer, Rodney Ramagalela, to upset Phunya Sele Sele, who ended their bad run at the weekend with a 1-0 win over Ajax.
