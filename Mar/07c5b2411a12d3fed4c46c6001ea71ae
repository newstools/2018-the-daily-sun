Nelson Mandela University students say the chaos
that resulted in the stoppage of a Varsity Cup game on Monday evening was the
fault of management and their "racist bouncers".Speaking to News24 on Tuesday, Sasco chairperson
Tshwarelo Sonti and SRC president Bamanye Matiwane claimed that students had
been provoked by racist bouncers and were forced to retaliate. Sonti, who led
the Sasco intervention at the game, said that four of their members had been attempting
to speak to the director of sport in the coach's box."Sasco never planned any violence. What we
wanted was for management to take concerns seriously," he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvaTfg71yQR_CJQkgVjXKSQPjTKdNfGEb40CiCFTG0eiZBxwHMuLnj2sPXSw08Xg0dtuppHP_mv8o2dGZgWg7s2Qq7FtMR8gtwQc4DdMdVFren9q5RdRKc9DaTNk32nb-8FwweHEsp0lxNUj3EYiNWAoEgjIUjWwOLvljKaPFV0NHxktPpzAAiAxhm-C-hGIhC38HH_Tz6X3vc7HDNiXUvd9C58NXJz5DfK_7QALuSoz-aRVe5P4--EsRIlwrgWoKpLZH4t12XNm046LNUrvGu6W1yFHcA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzH3YKOM8cLSVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

bouncers who had told them to move away from the coach's box, after they tried
to "engage" with the sports department."The school has a policy that we have direct
access to management, so it cannot be that when we want to engage management we
are going to be blocked by external security, as if we are a threat."The situation became tense when a bouncer pushed
him, which angered the other Sasco members, he added."They started to hit us, punch us and slap us.
Obviously when one is in that situation they are bound to hit back. They were
throwing racist remarks at us and all the bouncers were white. As management,
you can't unleash bouncers when students are coming to you," he added.NMU spokesperson Zandile Mbabela said that the
matter was under investigation by both the police and university protection
services."All available evidence is being collated and
will form part of the investigation process. Due process needs to unfold as we
work to speedily conclude the matter."Sonti has claims that this is not the first time
bouncers from the same security company have assaulted students.Sasco said its members only wanted to know from
coaches why black players were being left out of the squad."Key black players are not part of the squad.
They are reporting to the SRC that they are facing racism. Our team continues
losing, but we have key black players that are not given a chance."Matiwane backed Sonti, saying that students had
felt provoked by the bouncers.He told News24 that university management had
ignored their request to meet with them over transformation of sport at the
institution."We are in the process of doing mediation with
bouncers and students.We can never have a fight between bouncers and
students. Bouncers are supposed to stop students when there is a fight.If this continues, it will mean the university is
going to be in chaos,"Matiwane said.The SRC is also planning to call for
an immediate meeting with the SRC, representatives of Sasco and sport
management to discuss transformation, he said.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/racist-bouncers-to-blame-for-clashes-at-varsity-cup-game-nmu-students-20180313
