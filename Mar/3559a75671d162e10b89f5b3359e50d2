The choir is rated as one of the best in the world and the performance which left Legend awestruck happened a while ago. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsscJIUxH7WC2bvGj7XyU0sGJ1hg-dE4W18of6fwpUWAgA1yqw6ddt1eGTqHV3aJTShVAqFEhK7hZ6obLl5BpqFMcDSIP133D7VUFcRFiG9mMsfvrSjcj3aqjtd0QnBubVaUNHMU0sGKJsYunMxbVcydHV7kyeVi6sRIP-j2f9vXKNmwBxsQjo6hZl90vtF0NdbJqM0MEI5_lqR9F5FDFXoEmw1eWTsAntdfZShBV9QeP3yIYfe_dStzq9eSkGPrVw4w6G8c2R8K298KYoACDWcfkI5JkYedyZTsQA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzG48QRGmDaLWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
