I went to the Prospecton branch in 2001 to apply for her birth certificate. “Because I am not very educated, I didn’t notice her birth certificate stated that she was a boy,” said Mbhekiseni. He said he only became aware of the mistake in 2010 when a neighbour saw his daughter’s birth certificate. “My neighbour advised us to go to Home Affairs right away and have the mistake fixed before it gave Lungelo problems. We did as we were told but the mistake still hasn’t been fixed,” said the dad. “Lungelo and her twin brother Lungani are in matric. Lungani has started applying to study at institutions of higher learning but his sister hasn’t. “Lungelo’s teachers told us to put pressure on Home Affairs because if the mistake is not corrected soon, she might not get her results next year.” He said the situation is stressing him because he can tell it is depressing his daughter. “I am pleading with Home Affairs officials to tell me why the mistake has still not been rectified.” Provincial Home Affairs spokesman Cyril Mncwabe said: “This matter was recently brought to my attention and is being attended to by the Prospecton branch. “I have been advised of the communication between the office and the parents. I will provide feedback in due course.”
