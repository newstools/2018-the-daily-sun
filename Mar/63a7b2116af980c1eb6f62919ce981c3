Sergeant Tshepiso Mashale told Daily Sun the drama started when the two got into an argument inside their shack in Mshongoville. “Apparently, the man started assaulting his girlfriend with a sharp object.” When news of the fight spread, furious residents hunted the man down. Mashale said they attacked the man. “He was severely injured and residents called an ambulance to the scene,” said Mashale.“The two partners were taken to hospital with serious injuries and later died. Two murder cases were opened.” Residents told the SunTeam they don’t allow men to abuse women. Juliet Ngwenya (45) said domestic violence, especially against women and children, is unacceptable. “Men must know women are not their property. “They’re human beings and no one has the right to abuse them in any way.”She said the women from the area decided to teach men who abused their partners a lesson, so they’d know women should be respected, loved and treated well. “We won’t allow women to be abused. We know cops don’t want us to take the law into our own hands, but we’ll teach abusers a lesson they’ll never forget,” she said. Brigadier Ngwako Mashao asked residents not to take the law into their own hands. “We urge people to report any kind of crime,” he said.
