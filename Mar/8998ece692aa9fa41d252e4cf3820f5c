I remember they wanted to repossess our house at some point. It was so terrible. People would come and view the house and my daughter would say; 'What are they doing here? Why do they want to take our home?' I would go into the toilet and sit there and cry." he said.Â In 2016 Mavuso finally caught another break when he landed his first starring role since his Isidingo contract expired in the e.tv robbery drama Heist, playing the role of Chairperson - the police commander who makes it his mission to catch the gang.That role was just what he needed and it has opened more doors for him as he is now also on the soapie Rythm City and Mzansi Magic's Isithembiso.
