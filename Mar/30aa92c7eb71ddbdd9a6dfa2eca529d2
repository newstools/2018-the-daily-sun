However‚ after such great success‚ I have had to take stock of where I am and look to find new ways to push the boundaries of performance and continued improvement.“With this in mind‚ I decided to move to Port Elizabeth last year to further my athletics career closer to my home. Considering the change in location and my practical‚ everyday requirements‚ I have made a decision to change my performance team and explore other coaching opportunities.”
