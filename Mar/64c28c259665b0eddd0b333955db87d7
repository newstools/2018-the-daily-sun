We all make mistakes. We keep on forgetting that he was the government of humanity and the government of national unity.”He said the police and the military were never on Mandela’s side, but he managed to get them together and we should never undermine that. “Let us be truthful about history. Mandela brought peace. We did not want to go through what other countries had gone through. “We might have postponed accountability for the sake of hope, but it was to ensure that we have a stable country.”Hatang said the legacy of Mandela should be relevant even today.He also spoke about the land issue and warned that we shouldn’t be fooled. The question of land had always formed part of the constitution, he said.
