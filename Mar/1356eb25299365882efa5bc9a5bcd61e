A witness said: “I was working in my garden on Tuesday when I saw fire coming from my neighbour’s house. “When I went to investigate, her three kids were standing outside while the baby was crying in the house. “I told other neighbours and we called firefighters and cops. “The baby was rescued, but he was in a bad condition. “The mum was shocked when she arrived at the scene. I’m relieved that she didn’t lock the door because all her kids could have died.” Cops are investigating a case of culpable homicide.Police spokeswoman Constable Wendy Nkabi confirmed the baby died in hospital after sustaining severe burn wounds. She said the mum had left her kids at home to fetch her eight-year-old child from school. “While she was away the three-year-old was playing with matches and a fire was started in one of the rooms in the house,” said Nkabi.“The three kids left the room when the fire started, but they left the four-month-old behind. “The kids didn’t sustain any injuries and are now in the care of the woman’s brother. The woman’s been taken to a stress institution.”
