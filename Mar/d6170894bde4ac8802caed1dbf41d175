The Democratic Alliance has called for the axing of Minister Malusi Gigaba, who was recently moved from Minister of Finance back to Home Affairs, after the Constitutional Court refused to hear an appeal to overturn damning findings against him.DA Chief Whip, John Steenhuisen, said the Constitutional Court has refused to hear Gigaba’s appeal to set aside a judgment by a full Bench of the North Gauteng High Court, which had found that Gigaba had lied under oath when he testified during his former tenure as home affairs minister.Fireblade Aviation, which is controlled by the Oppenheimer family, had sought a declaratory order to compel Gigaba to abide by a decision he had taken to allow the company to run a customs and immigration service at a privately-owned airport operation.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss9BeBGLh8zJ-HZ0ai_BZnmeAj_7pnmQwZsvrIzTHw_EzJ5UyPfp8xrpy-0mrwjPtr0RR2OL2Xd7P09jOXuzeKwoCBO2yl2xUQKLA7J8Nk9j1SmzgwJNRKN6tqt7BS5VutWmp1jI4YeWuA7Msfdg_qTpvBbyhW3x2Rtv7VybEpMtOOSH2ZiGCTt1O15Xb8n3s6xdwmrZ_5Bi7hJVLddC-ycwfbHtw5La69t0U7hwiqrWzG74e-5y81nUWBOIhSDYN8yIYpA2XqJllocHd887o3itNzLUxw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMUQXrC-bOH5EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
