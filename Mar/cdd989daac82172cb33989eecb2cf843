MY cell insurance won’t pay!Senzo got a great deal on a new smartphone and took out insurance on it. But he was upset when it was stolen in a taxi a few months later. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>He called the insurance company to find out what to do. They told him to report his stolen phone to the police within 48 hours and then submit a claim to them within 60 days. But after doing this, the insurance didn’t want to pay out. He called them and was told his documents were late, and the claim had been rejected. This when he sent the documents to them the next day after speaking to them.Azikhiphi! He then went to Scorpion for advice.What does the law say?If you take out insurance and submit your claim and relevant documents like the insurance company tells you to, then they have a duty to pay out. In Mzansi law there are two types of insurance: indemnity insurance and non-indemnity insurance. Indemnity insurance is when the amount paid out for damages is the same as the amount of the loss (for Senzo, what the cellphone was worth). Non-indemnity insurance doesn’t pay out the same amount as the amount of the loss, and is at the discretion of the insurer. What to do It’s important to ensure what your cellphone insurance covers and excludes. You need to submit the relevant documents to your insurance provider, and they are obligated to communicate with you if your claim will be paid out or rejected. If they reject it, they must tell you why. In Senzo’s case, their reasoning is wrong, and he can dispute it.How can Scorpion help?Depending on Senzo’s policy, Scorpion will deal with the insurance company on his behalf. If they don’t pay out, we may refer the matter to the Short-term Insurance Ombudsman.If you want legal help, join SCORPION LEGAL PROTECTIONYou can strike back legally too!Click here
