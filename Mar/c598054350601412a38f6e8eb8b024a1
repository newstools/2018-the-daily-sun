WHEN her village finally got electricity from Eskom in 2012, gogo Buyiselwa Stishi was overjoyed. However, she was bitterly disappointed when her home was overlooked. The 65-year-old from Qhuru near East London said she still uses paraffin and wood to heat her home and cook.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>“The electricity pole is not far from my property but they told me I’m not on the grid,” the gogo told Daily Sun. In 2015, the Buffalo City Metro also provided electricity to houses in the area but the gogo was disappointed again. “Once again, my house was forgotten. I even paid to get a meter box but nothing happened,” she said. “When I went to ask what was going on, I was told there wasn’t enough money to connect my property.” When the SunTeam spoke to the gogo, she was standing next to the road waiting for a taxi so she could buy paraffin in East London. She said she would have to pay R46 for transport and another R50 for 5 litres of paraffin. Community leader Ntobeko Go (46) said the village the gogo lived in was old. “It has been around since 1973. There are newer villages that have already received electricity,” he said. Municipal spokeswoman Bathandwa Diamond said providing electricity to rural areas was Eskom’s job. Eastern Cape Eskom spokesman Zama Mpondwana said the problem was caused by a connection backlog and storms in the area. “However, we have an escalation process that informs customers of who to contact if they’re dissatisfied.”
