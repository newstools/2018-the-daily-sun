Consumers have the right to fair practice. “The Constitution and Consumer Protection Act support consumers who do not have the financial resources or legal fees if they were treated badly. We also advise people to be aware of internet scammers or schemes, when they get messages on their phones about winning competitions and being promised huge sums of money. “We celebrate the achievements made through the department of trade and industry in terms of consumer education. Issues went to the Consumer Court and our people won those cases we are celebrating today. “The Free State government assists our people for free at the Consumer Court. Moipone Lulama (60) of David Mohau Village said: “We’re happy to learn about people who steal our money if we don’t protect our identity. I was robbed after someone told me if I deposited R1 000, it would multiply.”
