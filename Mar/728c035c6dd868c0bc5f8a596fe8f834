TOMORROW marks the 58th anniversary of the Sharpeville Massacre. The event that happened on 21 March 1960 is a distant memory for many but for those who survived the terrible day, it is still very real.  The People’s Paper recently drove with Agnes Tsoai (78), Elizabeth Chabeli (69), Selina Mnguni (81) and Abraham Mofokeng (78) to the old police station.There, apartheid police gunned down 69 people, including their loved ones, neighbours and residents.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvL3KBZdQEGTPoQMbPf8NmzIAy7pq_dnZt4Lj40pVVz6DUJKmaMWoQPOV_AcimQK6HtSJR_Q-Xfd1elZDI0bpZot-5rPFOY2iRd3PfFE_jwUpz8b_BqKWwymDH4gMOo3uLvN_Xp_2YOO1jrT_alrSNbB-MvVArYXdrScyZ718ao6A_p_yZDiDD3rEOQPxoBv-JtyJMAScnkR0dJWzX6EECCiVwH3eCIZHK-Hvahz-EjapGuEY_l-osHYZfKvQuihr_exMZFZdANRKWkCr62dswJfx4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOfWMEh1DM14EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We went there, fully prepared to get arrested for not having our pass books. But we didn’t think we would be shot.” He hoped the government would do more than just commemorate the event once a year.“We don’t feel respected,” he said.Agnes said she hid for years after the incident as she feared being arrested.She said she has seen many of the victims die because of the bullets left in their bodies. “Some of us are very sick. We need to be medically checked to determine our condition but our cries are never heard.” She said many people lost their loved ones that day.“There were 180 survivors but some have died and others have just disappeared.”She said they are hopeful that one day they will get the recognition they deserve. “We wish we could be remembered more often and not only when the commemoration comes.” Mphonyana Besi, a family member of one of the victims, said it is not so much about money. “Something is wrong if we don’t live like normal people,” she said.Maria Mantsho is Sedibeng regional secretary of Khulumani Support Group, an organisation that speaks for massacre survivors. She said they will seek compensation for the survivors.“There are over 300 survivors of the Sharpeville Massacre who rely on their pensions to support large families,” said Maria.“After 20 years of democracy, it’s good to see South Africa has not forgotten the heroes whose blood watered the tree of freedom. But more needs to be done to help them.” When the SunTeam was at the Sharpeville site the week before Human Rights Day, that section of the cemetery was overgrown with long grass, which is normally cut just before the day.
