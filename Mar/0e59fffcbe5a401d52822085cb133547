MADALA Bongani Khanyile (61) said he can’t sleep at night unless he sees cops patrolling in front of his house. The madala from Emathulini in Pietermaritzburg, KZN, said not enough is being done to protect people living with albinism. He told the SunTeam how he narrowly escaped death when he was thrown into the boot of a car last month. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvXoOZcjXd3-8PTSAssWx5H3QUTFV9y1LVcuJKWbY6exzOBxQpJ327dpSK1R30RtNGS3v6houg1UR0pACRjB2_QmV7wGbZZWogwmZfltsOOi5iKth0EoVVUKh4jmMNa2WcWGsU-3OHQhdX7vemH98np7U4RvCHR6POXwied-oRP0aDoaKrgzrwMaONJUxtTdjbZKQcebHfByvI-ra24D7JWF2n50ZICwYpyHy_inCWzjsi25-y0OColYyHVupBzhcxYrFCCEAgs___eIj1JChhnVzl5lQw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBW_ydAKwkGXEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The boot opened and when the car stopped, I jumped out and ran into the bush. “It was hard for them to find me because it was dark, so they gave up and left.“I asked around and was told that I was in Ngcongangconga, 7 km from home.“The police refused to open a case for me because I didn’t get the car’s registration number. “Now I’m terrified because the kidnappers might come back.” Maxwell Thabethe, provincial chairman of the Albinism Society of South Africa, said police are failing some of the most vulnerable people in the country.“Cops refuse to help in situations like this. We want them to open cases.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “The madala should ask the station commander to assist him.”
