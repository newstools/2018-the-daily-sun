THE Safa elections may have been postponed. But there is no end in sight to the raging battle for the top job in the country’s football leadership. The suspension of the elective congress, which had been scheduled for Saturday, appears to have strengthened the resolve of members opposed to the leadership of incumbent Safa president Danny Jordaan, chiefly Mwelo Nonkonyana.Safa confirmed its decision to postpone the elections in order to address issues that may “impact the credibility” of the congress.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvUuQYQ1qMfy-jgwLVVxJoBj6PirMYGpO6A6RNWI83N5_Sl_wO1-z7d6r7YRGM9TcrVPukTcrqUAmKot1E1M9WvpsQqxOVSU2jVftx3akSzewj-QNAH_HFZdQ0kf7v9tlT2Q5bNUQTRhCF3E7EiwbFH69Y1r8cGNjqFB9iUnEJ20Huw4pAiMVGu701RWbaIC0cElmRToVZ_zJZTlTbTlKQO9WUWN0XUpLBqsT_GGAvwEI540-NUYZBaAGb3rdVvFda2UMi5NuyoswFzYHo7\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAt1Zn9TjpEWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But he argues that the matter was pre-judged and vowed to appeal the “wrong” decision so that a different judge could deal with the “merits of the case”.Said Nonkonyana: “He only dealt with the urgent application and not the merits of the case.“But in any event, the congress has been postponed and I won’t rest until the process starts afresh. Safa removed me knowing that I have a case pending, hence my decision to interdict the congress on the grounds that it would be unconstitutional.“Yes, the matter was struck from the roll, but it is not true that I’ve lost the case. The case was removed from the roll, it can be added again. I’m going to appeal the court’s decision.”Safa has maintained that Nonkonyana should be banned for life and that the FA should start processes to recoup the millions of rands incurred from court cases against him.Added Nonkonyana: “It’s laughable that Safa can write to Fifa and say individuals who take football cases to courts of law must be reported and that such individuals should be banned. In fact, I’d be happy if they did so because Fifa would give me a proper hearing. “Whether or not they file a complaint against me, the entire court process will start again. I’m determined to fight to the bitter end. I won’t allow Danny Jordaan and his honchos to run Safa as if it’s their own property.”Safa said postponing the elections would give its electoral committee sufficient time to thrash out all matters of compliance. A full report would be compiled for Fifa on the way forward regarding the elections.
