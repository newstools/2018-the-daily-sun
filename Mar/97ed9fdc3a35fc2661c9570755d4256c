STUART Baxter is buoyed by the many positives from their Four Nations participation but the Bafana Bafana coach is certainly not getting carried away by the rare cup success.Bafana’s achievement in Zambia wasn’t met with much glee from the football public, with many overlooking the fact that some of the youngsters got their first taste of international football – and excelled.The fact that veteran goalie Itumeleng Khune played ahead of Brendon Petersen in a “friendly” tournament has hardly helped sway Baxter’s biggest critics.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvgU3wfwYo5YyZo7PzITj75kZIurLKp1-Q6Do1Lqm4IVXPBCwgfrYS2YS0q2TDMEwe9UytoqYnz16AtN_crtRXK9mGv89x82NDhnOf5zhk2R3vcgihJZg5dULu-3m7NMj7E8WxiGkQheU0XybfrCEfp1N2TcaBfHttJ8rGWrWYlgCc6qDYA9wCLfhO81opzJCA3xNsxhY898IcufbUbF-Olp6H4XyGr6xcT8VQ43gmDLgNtabQPGojnXzVX2F7BpmVPlNbWWS1f1KETnS6m\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKI4mgVa7D4pEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But this is a step in right direction . . . seeing the fans happy. We are looking to give them this times 10 (what we achieved),” said Baxter.“I wouldn’t be depressed if we had lost 2-1 in the final and played fantastic football – and when I look at the youngsters I say ‘hey, we are getting closer’. As long as we are getting closer, we need to persist.“For a long, long time we’ve been looking for this epiphany, that we will suddenly have a national team that sweeps all before them. And every time we failed we got so depressed and negative. But this is a step in trying to make that epiphany happen further down the road. “As Tiger Woods said, he became an overnight success after 15 years’ work.” Bafana scored three and conceded one goal, debutant Lebo Mothiba netting twice in the tournament.The likes of Reeve Frosler, Teboho Mokoena and Siphesihle Ndlovu seized opportunities too, enhancing their prospects of further call-ups in future.But only time will tell how much they benefitted from the tournament, as there is no competitive match lined up for any time soon. Thulani Hlatshwayo, one of the seniors in the team, hailed Baxter’s decision to pick the youngsters: “The tournament was really good for us but more so for the youngsters coming into the team. We shared the camp and tried to make them comfortable because if they were tense, they wouldn’t have been able to show their ability. It was tough tournament but we managed to beat Zambia.”
