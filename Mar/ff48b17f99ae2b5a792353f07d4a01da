Veteran rapper, Stogie T, formerly known as Tumi from the V, got Twitter all riled up earlier this week with what appeared to be a rather nasty side to his persona.“Young dude stopped me by the car, said 'wanna hear the bars' nah go get a job,” he tweeted.Within minutes, Twitter users attacked the rapper whose real name is Tumi Molekane, calling him all kinds of vulgar names and making jokes about his weight.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsulM4f6dVaAH8i6US8pbloVINCNEemEPXAKLw4iAML4f-6uea7tWFhPDCdnW9Pkd8zQZ-LZfdER79i34dRpjHWDpHwJyKUwo3doVKOo1S2GNicR02qnV30FVP9BxttN51lT_5kluFTC2L5e6nxebFqAupT5WCnNmdUGazuC80974zC9xmcg9AUtPBOZTNA2I3glahMRfFNlROR7ea5QVqpOPd5IxmcRqPAhhujP26B4PFXDmS9XkpHCCgT1uTKhh8HmSYfIk9rg9yxCeMAxO4vhkCIRgpDer9Xgnw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJrHRM2Z4zEnEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Being in the game so long, being fed screams you forget the hunger you once had....I cried....I saw myself as the kid that only wanted to freestyle and then gets tweeted about....#StogieTrash".In a rare twist of fate, Stogie T featured Nomonde on the very song he was tweeting about.The song makes a profound statement on what it truly takes to make it in the music industry, while also commenting on the irony of people who have the talent but never make it vs those who are in it for all the wrong reasons.During all of this, Stogie T has masterfully shown us the dangers of being gullible on social media and how easy it is to get caught up in what everyone else is doing, saying negative things about strangers without even understanding where they is coming from."When Stogie T tweeted 'go get a job' as his response to an aspiring rapper black twitter went full mob on him. They dragged him calling him all sort of vile expletives even using the hashtag StogieTrash. "In a unexpected twist Stogie T revealed that the lines "This young dude stopped me by the car, said 'wanna hear the bars' nah go get a job" were actually from a rap song the rapper had been writing. "It seemed he was trolling black twitter to ultimately reveal the full story and make them all rethink their knee jerk reaction. Stogie vs Black Twitter is a sombre telling of the full imagined story that reveals why he would respond in such a seemingly rude way. "In a further class move Stogie features Nomonde Sky who had responded with a freestyle of her own berating the rapper. OUT TODAY," Stogie shared on Instagram after releasing the song.Listen to the song here:When Stogie T tweeted 'go get a job' as his response to an aspiring rapper black twitter went full mob on him.
