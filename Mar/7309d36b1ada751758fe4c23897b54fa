This comes after the NGOâ€™s secretary, Zukiswa Mbhem and deputy chairman Mandisa Monco, together with other members, approached Nombiba to request a donation of R10 000 from the municipality.The state alleges that the councillor instructed the NGO members to put their request in writing but not mention the amount they were requesting. The request was prepared and signed by both Mbhem and Monco. Nombiba reportedly told the NGO members that the amount paid into their bank account was R30 000 and that the R10 000 was theirs but the R20 000 was his.The prosecutor told the court that during his testimony Nombiba was not a reliable witness.
