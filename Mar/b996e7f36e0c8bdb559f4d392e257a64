CLOCOLAN farmers got the shock of their lives when they recovered 14 stolen sheep, two of which were found dead on the side of the road. Word on the streets of the Free State kasi is that when thugs have no victim to stab, they turn their energies to the poor sheep. Residents on Monday woke up to find the dead sheep with stab wounds dumped on the side of the road on Monday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssKA9JlWxNdEjIsWS1mreEO4Dda47RHTaRAGlLu0Dls3nuwdo2mF5mC0Ylcge49OM-DRs9TNx0st6Dlo7gzTqCW4h2FWbHXcggE0m7cKHDhTg8DKZHS_lfLYbZP00Gbfz3mqkBe7qFamxjWOEiXDhqAmgzuvrOdDmqgVkp9bCaRQtaF1ybJk1-IqCfhnc017cun27ZZ3TliSEbtMwaJx1jeTUA0QGt3rs1nbTMBYAycbh1Pom5k3BC3LeaDcHjlyNwugVa7gkGIqKXudazUi3T79OFQvfw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBfM8A_E7Ov0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Another resident said he saw the sheep being slaughtered when he was driving from his grandfather’s house which is about 2km away from where the incident happened. “I was shocked to see two sheep lying on the road being slaughtered. I was surprised by the incident but didn’t want to stop because I thought maybe it was a trap to get motorists to pull over.” He said stock theft was high in their area. “Thugs also often kill livestock to test the sharpness of their knives before using them on people. I just hope they get arrested and locked up in jail for a very long time.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Fikiswa Matoti confirmed the incident.“One suspect has been arrested and charged with stock theft. He will appear before in the Clocolan Magistrates Court soon.”
