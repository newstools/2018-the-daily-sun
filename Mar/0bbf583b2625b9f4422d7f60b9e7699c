Scientists warn that a doomsday asteroid that is taller than USA's Empire State building could WIPE OUT life on Earth in 2135.Scientists also warn that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) will be unable to defend the Earth against a doomsday asteroid that could smash into Earth in 2135.Researchers found that it might be impossible to stop the space rock - which is the size of the Empire State building - from careering into Earth next century. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsstTVGVC55L-Dtdhm6_5Wj1UrDAK4rLOEKwrwHEGUdAQ-1HtvpipGFbcL2l35EoEl65Qx0TC7KSap8yWpfY1D4h-qC_-TwbfXwXfojasPaPLTpRB19bGbjb0FVD2DqgTPDcEXw583z_fxt3_j4H7hs0v_TFDAn3gEJP4MKghHA62LBMyMt8DbA0IL9mVaygtpPk6HnpjwwZQzNqQx3i2Pb3BT1F0LvuY9TLpZH2V2Ams4CpW_blkO3P-zOGr65ipYEO6jYVFEu6E7YU8rtcdVXvKH2DX5nKoz7vaw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAJPjzSHIaruEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
