I find it fascinating that the 30-something, black, middle class characters portrayed in this film never existed 20 years ago because it was essentially illegal to be black and middle class and I guess it would also be impossible to engage in angst ridden, existential navel gazing when you’re fleeing tear gas and rubber bullets from the Apartheid cops." he said in media reports.
