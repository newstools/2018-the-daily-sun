Councillor Andries Motene said he was shocked to make the discovery. “We were lucky to discover the damage in time,” Motene told Daily Sun.“It looks like the people who disconnected the pipe wanted to steal it.“This is definitely sabotage because residents often complain about the lack of water. “Now we’ve discovered one of the reasons for the constant lack of water in the area. “People must guard these pipes because when they are stolen, the whole community suffers. “We’ve reported the matter to the municipality and they have promised to hire a private company to fix it.” Resident Julia Mtsweni said: “We have been without water for too long in the area. We are not going to tolerate this kind of behaviour. “These people are making our lives difficult.“The water pipes were installed for the whole community by the municipality, so there is no need to damage them.”Another resident said nyaope boys might be behind the damaged pipe.Simphiwe Mashiyane, a spokeswoman for Thembisile Hani Municipality, said the pipe will soon be fixed.She urged residents to look after the pipes and to report the culprits to the cops.
