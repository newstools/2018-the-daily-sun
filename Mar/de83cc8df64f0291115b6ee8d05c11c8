Michael drowned in kak.The Komapes became linked to children’s struggle for sanitation and safe schools around Mzansi. Pikoli said: “We were hoping that their case would serve as a warning of the depths to which we should never find ourselves sinking. “Sadly, the education department has shown it has not learned this lesson or drawn a line beyond which they are not willing to go.” Last Monday Lumka Mketwa (5) drowned in a pit toilet at Luna Primary in Bizana, Eastern Cape.
