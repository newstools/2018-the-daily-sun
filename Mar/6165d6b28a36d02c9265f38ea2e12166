I thought they were dry logs until one moved. My colleagues cornered the client as they thought he was refusing to pay. We explained and they went to investigate.” Her colleagues couldn’t find anything but were too afraid to keep operating. “The crocodiles have closed our business.” But while the magoshas may be crying over lost business, Savannah resident Makoma Mohale (37) welcomed the crocs’ good job. “Bronkhorstspruit Road is clean thanks to these crocodiles. We have been complaining for years about these sex workers but nothing was done.” Pastor Grace Moleko of the Day of Pentecost Church said they prayed for the road to be safe and clean. “God answered us. God is intervening by sending crocodiles.”
