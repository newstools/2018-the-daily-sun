The Anglican Church in Cape Town is urgently taking steps to address sex abuse cases in the church.In a statement, Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, Reverend Thabo Makgoba, said he has started urgent consultations to address the issue and to "strengthen" procedures which are in place for those who deal with sex abuse cases when they are reported.His statement comes after "four individuals have either spoken out publicly or contacted my office privately "to report sex abuse in two dioceses, apparently during the 1970s and 1980s.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvnUGzbqIZ2L-YfP-cBrsnVRAIfgTEelapJMeg6zcWk5BVlLMykBBB2gsVOg80dftD-uV3YgDjdnt6CsNaO1qF6KXYpuFnjf_5e8FvqqB3cwX4b11zdOK2p70Tm5m55JsFf62388RJ8NtzcB_pEjbKphCeF91XuMAZs4YPxkfcwWPRdjqvd9IX4ClBZYtW36gK6BOn9w0KFHYJEBcDbStTqIVFEWlZ-nzoFw3H9PQBsAcR3XGh94JfBAKc8hCP0WI1g1A_dV_aRkbUhkaKxJiFm13QEVZ0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHplDBeFizurEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They should include a psychologist, social worker or counsellors, someone who is qualified to give legal advice, a community worker from outside the church, and the head of the affected entity within the church."I am also urgently consulting more widely on how the church cannot only act more effectively, but be seen to act effectively in cases of sexual abuse. Key to my efforts is to achieve holistic and sustainable healing."Makgoba said he took responsibility for what had happened in the church in the past.Where the church failed or wronged anyone, "We beg their forgiveness."Every human being deserves to have the dignity bestowed on them by God respected. Anyone who demeans this through any form of abuse, demeans themselves and God."https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anglican-archbishop-tackles-sex-abuse-in-the-church-20180322
