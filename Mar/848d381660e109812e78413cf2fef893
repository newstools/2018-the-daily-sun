BAROKA FC advanced to the quarterfinals of the Nedbank Cup after defeating ABC Motsepe League side Steenberg United 2-0 at the Peter Mokaba Stadium.Steenberg looked promising and they were organised in the opening exchanges and in the first 10 to 15 minutes they were attacking Bakgaga as they enjoyed more possession.But as the tough gets going Baroka raised the bar when Mpho Kgaswane almost opened the scoring in the 21st minute with a well struck left footed shot from just outside the box but it missed narrowly wide.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssr_AqgtG916wkxs4EwGG4_P29Xza8oBoPIb2eC2gX1vw5c2VCIhqrmAsOt_21nEBCzUP9BO65Za4Z0I6th6kW6Yr09zzYaOYShJw_5fvZEBWCnE4K5RofmRR4XUu6qsIEi_DTotRB6mmGF0f12sOfQ7yZVXhJy4r8nDAhDOgVHCU63BQpnsK47lDxpc4l6u-m9UIgPA4qD7pg2z3OEsPsB1R6m4BPPHzgYE5Ki2Ysl5e8ZkynR2C8S9HGJSkjzZ57jZp_0Kup8mLtxCcPB\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCyAB7rmXm4YEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Stars captain Paulus masehe scored the opening gola in the 47 minute which was cancelled by linda Mntambo 11 minutes later before Keita gets the winner in the 88 minute.
