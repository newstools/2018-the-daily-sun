meaningless unless they are made public and action taken in suspicious cases,”
said Bloom.He said all the ANC members of the Gauteng Legislature
have agreed to undergo lifestyle audits but ducked his question as to whether
these would be made public.Bloom added: “Corruption will only be vanquished when
real action is taken against implicated individuals, rather than empty
gestures.”A number of cabinet ministers including government
officials have been implicated in the looting of state resources.Makhura during his State of the Province address
called on all MEC’s to join him as he will be taking the lead to voluntarily
subject himself to a lifestyle audit.This was after President Cyril Ramaphosa, during his
parliament debate last month, announced that government officials will undergo
lifestyle audits as part of fighting corruption.
