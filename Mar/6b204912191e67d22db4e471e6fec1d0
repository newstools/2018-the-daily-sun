Football is a very emotional sport and its fans can be a very unforgiving bunch.Players get huge amounts of praise when they perform well but they also face the harshest criticism when they fail to meet supporters’ levels of expectations on the field.When that happens, it is very helpful to have a friend by your side that understands what you are going through and is able to help you take your mind off things.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuvjwlQc88HAyFXyRH83fcM9auaEArt-Nv-y3HTggKMg46B5eO0NKo2wRuIqyOoGBZ39nNKCUFC2oy8ZS185FouqNhIqG-XoX2kloss27zQgYtA_SGyi7q_3IdZaKp-s15IO0MPgtDGvMkm_rei10jXcKsgreUIsBpao3rIeZiAqY6klPCXhB2OggHHF-Yor6yeGon3QUoXJfRZ8MY8-PMwfszq6wKQUxvAGnmEe-4a5z8qDKFvQ_-BDTq8J5hQjFChtFTye43j0MU_opMu9u2TuJ8VNzzNcDJzaA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzO9zQ6vJav-fEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
