Durban-born rapper, presenter and model, Mthoko ‘Dash’ Mkhathini’s career has seen a boom over the past year or two.Since bursting onto the entertainment scene with Dreamteam in 2011, Dash has spread his wings to presenting on shows such as V Entertainment, All Access Mzansi and now the Ultimate House Party which started last night on Mzansi Magic.He also has a few fashion deals and some other business ventures under his belt.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstTxq3Wv8W3LK-1TITlEmCH8TadrPIBcWqjmwXXdgZRyHGxrkKeWlewMlkBwpdNJ04K42RvKJUVsW6t14f2HmabVdaWtnDyBEkAn-h8w8PGDYrNbDCulmiONA2neILVrYoBo1GbXCz2VUi30ECnuyd5jNKxDC6CYxfNa-sZJ87psOSXehbQRcErYMTxejJ73A1HkgM9dO7gELOEqPQGjadFEqjm4JuozeGqDFJ3kvDNMH_GgYKUSqwYJVWz-zCFqel9b-tYVtf1OdyrI3XX2vXpc1K23D2_fc2OjQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLMzT9gbxT4rEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Is he just too big for the group now? Or has Dash left music all together? Only time will tell.New Music Coming soon Hope you are ready.??????????????#NewMusic @lecoqsportif #shareyourlcs @converse.za #foreverchuck ?? @tankisotankkhumaloA post shared by  DreamTeam (@dreamteamdbn) on Mar 20, 2018 at 11:43pm PDT
