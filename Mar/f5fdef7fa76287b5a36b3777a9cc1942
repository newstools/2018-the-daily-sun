She took everything. “I have no bed to sleep in and all other furniture was taken too.“I went to the cop shop and laid charges of theft against her, but I’m surprised that the cops who were quick to arrest me are not busting her.”He said he had helped her on many occasions and sent her to school. “I’ve been nice to her all these years and I can’t believe what she has put me through,” he said. Hlengiwe confirmed she laid assault charges against her boyfriend. She moved out because she didn’t feel safe. “I took everything that belonged to me. I didn’t steal from him.” Captain Mega Ndobe said cops were investigating counter theft and assault charges.
