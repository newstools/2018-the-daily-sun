THE Automobile Association (AA) has warned motorists to prepare themselves for high petrol price increases, as the fuel levies proposed by the finance minister will kick in.According to the AA international petroleum product prices, which have remained stable since mid-February, have climbed sharply since 12 March."We’re anticipating an increase of around 63 cents a litre for petrol, 57 cents for diesel. Illuminating paraffin, which is not affected by the levy increases, is expected to decrease by around four cents," the AA said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvwHii9HXafkS1uv1e6iYW46GH5cyILAJhzWPZX1xsn-3ngJhMzYda9ny0i-nZkrL6NBFyXCpZtlSFzNXtWi5ADjc6XJHVNxVzUn9kuo-9gDpdU0ozZkInYtc5rVBEtuqM46UqYxoflQUBb0FsdmnL0eNTvaYDmkNgJMd08JeGl0hLMWQjwmklIYRoderuSSnb7CyNQxqzLtRID_bxYycjHOihIhyoT6azrIRJ1utkSwSn22fnHZ9qM3YFTBOur6Z9HdXTmvRpzvIFGRWQXhMGYAy3Sxo0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzALCUnRbZSRyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Public transport providers such as taxis and busses will have to cover these increases by passing them directly to consumers, which means more of their already small wage packet goes to transport costs,” the AA added.However, the association mentioned that  the good news is that ratings agency Moody’s decision to hold its current rating and change its outlook to ‘stable’ gives Mzansi a much-needed breathing space.
