He received a further 15% fine of his match fee and an additional demerit point bringing his total to nine.Meanwhile, Australia all-rounder Mitchell Marsh has also been fined 20 per cent of his match fee and handed one demerit point for a level 1 offence under 2.1.4 of the Code which pertains to “using language or gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting during an International Match.” Marsh accepted the charge and no formal hearing was needed.Jeff Crowe of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees said: “I found that there was contact between Rabada and Smith, and in my judgement the contact by Rabada was inappropriate, and deliberate. He had the opportunity to avoid the contact, and I could not see any evidence to support the argument that the contact was accidental.“It is also disappointing that this has happened the day after the pre-match meeting I had with both teams, where the importance of respect for opponents was highlighted.“I take no pleasure in seeing a player suspended, particularly a young player of Kagiso’s talent, but he has now breached the ICC Code of Conduct on a number of occasions.”The charges against Rabada and Marsh were levelled by on-field umpires Chris Gaffaney and Kumar Dharmasena, third umpire Sundaram Ravi and fourth umpire Bongani Jele.Rabada’s demerit point historyFebruary 2017 - Three demerit points v Sri Lanka for inappropriate and deliberate physical contactJuly 2017 - One demerit point v England for a send-off offence, (One match suspension / four accumulated demerit points)February 2018 - One demerit point v India for a send-off offenceMarch 2018 - Three demerit points v Australia for inappropriate and deliberate physical contact(Two match suspension / eight accumulated demerit points)March 2018 - One demerit point v Australia for a send-off offence
