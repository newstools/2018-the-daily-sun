This facility which is exclusive to Comrades novices is a superb start in that direction.”The Novice Hospitality Area also presents an opportunity for the CMA to recognise the special contribution of our running legends, especially those who have completed or are completing their 40th Comrades Marathons. Many of these greats will now be able to share their experiences and advice with our novices.Amongst the offerings for our novices will be motivational talks, running advice and photo sessions with select Comrades personalities. The Novice Hospitality zone captures the essence of what it means to be a Comrades runner, and brings to life the history and great moments of the world’s greatest footrace.It will include elements of past Comrades, life size stands of some of the legends and comprise of a video area where footage of previous races will be shown. It will also feature Comrades stories and documentaries.“The Comrades Novice Hospitality zone is intended to develop into a very special offering, designed to greatly enrich the experience of all new Comrades runners. We invite all first time runners to be part of the great race, from this select zone at the Expo through to race day,” Vilakazi concluded.
