TROUBLES over the mkhukhu classroom school are far from over. Pupils of Simunye High School in Bekkersdal, west of Joburg, are protesting about their mkhukhu classrooms that are made out of steel containers. The department and community seem unable to agree on a site where a new school can be built. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv1KcHG3O03s7YUygLqxTJVvvo5n9U1LFNu0vZvjn35JwvurAu0w6gPABmnC_f9TZTJeRuYDniRAnqYVPCb1fEopxhyhSJ4yVINCQrECxvdHOzzMwPqw7ij85ltjLum24HfXeOLndtxcFYA6yiHrGl4WZCicOyTIFcQugtL3YuYOT-e8zvXOn15DrlzE_eDyyo-DzF-Yh8f2TagC_fZ8OXoZMjVW190tg9jrNFOIbde3996oFsJEH3_alnUeyULszoJjtpE8Y4m_szrKJhOrYu1YuSOfMY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLu_LTl8c3xGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Yesterday, teachers driving to school could be seen making U-turns and avoiding the school, instead opting to mark the first term tests at the Randfontein district offices. Kids said conditions were not conducive for learning and they’d rather be taught on the streets. Security guards wouldn’t allow the SunTeam access to the school, saying the principal had instructed them not to allow anyone in. Cosas chairman Charles Makwakwa told Daily Sun Education Minister Angie Motshekga visited the container school two years ago and acknowledged the kids’ right to demonstrate. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said the department is aware of the problem and will build a school. “But the community is undecided on which area to build it in,” he told Daily Sun.“We went to the extent of suggesting a site 5km from the current school, but the community didn’t agree.  “This situation is equally frustrating for us because the department is ready to begin building the school.”
