THANKS to SunPower, 108-year-old Nokhariyoti Apolis can move around again. The gogo from Khayelitsha in Cape Town got a new wheelchair on Human Rights Day after her family approached the People’s Paper for help. Her daughter Nozuko (52) said it used to be a struggle to take her mum for medical treatment as the family didn’t have the money to hire transport to take her to the clinic. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvEmwCoPYIWaYSjp6cVM10noAwC9B5SVSbe09SSzVlD1feUoEfDfUvCaz33pesFNaEY_PHplBdxMxVqjcuAnBopm7Y9DxVmv8Wwbnyo5EyLvaObREINig-btSnMeqmn4KDqZMxlAS81eSUOrLi4hPujA6KPSizIqxs8dF5Cwft6F3_wuFTYYzm3V8W05j5e3HWzcOEk2obuKgeII4tXKs9J0nnuBjKbE7Tykhwokrv2WkC_MEdkic4FZ-9EeM8tRhGhfMnwq6Zs-JX-wjSLB-8kXVzPMl0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM40C88mn5nfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Even though Stemele isn’t a councillor for Khayelitsha, he didn’t waste any time in helping the gogo. The councillor said: “We want to make sure our people and especially our old people are taken care of. “That is why I did something, even though it was on short notice.” Nozuko said the family would save a lot of money as the gogo would be able to go to the clinic in her wheelchair. “Now I agree when people say Daily Sun is the People’s Paper,” she said. “We have been asking for help for a long time and we will forever be grateful.” After receiving her wheelchair, the gogo immediately asked to go outside for some fresh air. “Most people don’t care about old people but Daily Sun made sure I got a wheelchair,” she said.
