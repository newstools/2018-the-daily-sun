Some fall pregnant and others are infected with diseases.” Kabelo said he believes the centre will take people off the streets.“Our kasi is dull and boring. The only entertainment here is taverns and that’s not healthy.” He said the youth in his area are talented but can’t use their talents.“This will be a platform for them to enjoy themselves and make good use of their skills.” He said their ward councillor had given him land to build the centre on.“I have already received blessings from parents and leaders in our community. I’m grateful for their support.” He said he was still struggling to save enough money for building materials.“I need all the help I can get so this project can become a success.”He said he’s been hosting events where he invites popular DJs to raise money.“I’m hosting another event on the 8 September and all the money made there will go straight to the centre.”
