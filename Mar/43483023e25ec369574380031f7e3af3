They claimed the money was meant for development. Community leader Victor Mphakoe said they only wanted a date that stated when the development would happen in their area. “Our community suffers due to a lack of basic human needs. “All we want is for Rustenburg mayor Mpho Khunou to assist us. “We don’t want to fight but we want answers. We have sent many requests to see the mayor, but with no luck,” he said. Member of mayoral committee Michael Mhlungu said all the issues were addressed with the relevant departments and directorates. He said the community would have to provide evidence regarding the alleged R30 million and open a case with the police.
