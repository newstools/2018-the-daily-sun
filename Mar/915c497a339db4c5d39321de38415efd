I understand that many teams would benefit from us beating Sundowns but to be honest, we need this win for ourselves. “Relegation is not under discussion – now we’re talking top eight.”Not only will Nomvethe and company be looking to return to the top eight tonight but they will also be eager to do the double over Pitso Mosimane’s troops. Nomvethe, who is convinced that they can beat Sundowns again, was among the scorers when they beat Downs 2-1 at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Tshwane back in October.Another KZN team in action this weekend is Team of Choice who will be away to SuperSport United at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow (6pm). Fadlu Davids and his charges will want to cement their place in the top four.Like this story?
