Supplies to trade were also halted."We're confident that we will recall everything that needs to be recalled," said Naicker.Everything brought back will be incinerated and it still too early to quantify the costs associated with the recall, Naicker added.The company had launched a broadcast, print, and social media campaign to get the products off shelves and out of homes, and has combined it with an awareness campaign on the symptoms of listeriosis as well as basic hygiene tips.It is also working with chiefs in rural areas to make sure the message is spread.Although production and supply to trade has stopped, staff are at factories conducting deep cleaning.Rainbow Chicken Limited (RCL) also recalled its Rainbow polony as a precautionary measure, but comment was not immediately available for an update on progress.Motsoaledi also announced that RCL Foods' polony products tested positive for listeria monocytogenes, but not the ST6 sequence responsible for the outbreak.Rainbow Chicken's fresh and frozen products are not affected.The Department of Health was also investigating the RCL Foods polony production facility in Wolwehoek and was waiting for a report to confirm the results.As the recalls continue, health department spokesperson Popo Maja said there was no new information available.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/listeriosis-scare-3-500-tons-of-polony-and-cold-meat-returned-so-far-20180315
