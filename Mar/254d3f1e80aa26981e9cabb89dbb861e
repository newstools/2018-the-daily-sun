The State has provisionally withdrawn a charge of child
abuse against IPID head Robert McBride in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court on
Tuesday morning. McBride appeared briefly in the dock as the State announced
that the matter was being provisionally withdrawn. No reason was given. McBride was charged with child abuse and an alternative
charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, after allegedly
assaulting one of his daughters in 2017.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuMchMGAN9T82SrU00NyYdfMPjJkFB4uWjaRIWr5_LEcl-WQpV_MvYGV-m7QorDrTpsoIsyYXC_ZiczB10DCme7oW1v_XdxyisjyrRozybfckdAJ5TtII6oK1MKnRWGIKShnOi7AxmlZZUVrUK0ujz8mU9UnFGjrGUaWW0Z5cTfAk6KJ_v9499oXfl0hQX7QRAyyAqPEtOW4xdOvCDLjieJkQcCjd2elh95ku9LB9cMyNlNKSEBFcX06YjxWrjHOLOGM9_2pP61L26M7qcRTVTWx0-0DjE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPHJz21JjMx_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

they were happy with the decision. At his last court appearance the court heard that McBride
had abandoned his representations on why he should not be prosecuted and that
he would like to follow through with the trial.Hamman also announced that they intended on calling
McBrideâ€˜s youngest daughter, who cannot be named as she is a minor, as a
witness for the defence.This is the same daughter that McBride was able to see and
make contact with after he brought an application to have her excluded from the
list of witnesses that he was not allowed to make contact with.In November last year, Magistrate Ignatius du Preez found in
favour of McBride's application, amending bail conditions to exclude one of his
daughters listed on the witness list.He said the amendment was in the interests of justice and
fairness and would not be detrimental to the prosecution or the case if the
application is granted.Du Preez further said that there would be no limitations to
the access granted to McBride and questioned why the State had not yet obtained
a witness statement from this particular daughter."If the prosecution was serious about this witness,
they would have obtained a statement by now," said Du Preez."The court is not convinced that a limitation with
access to [one of McBride's daughters] is fair to Mr McBride."The charges against McBride are related to an incident that
allegedly took place while McBride and one of his daughters were driving in a
car.He broke his silence after the news broke in August 2017."I admit that I admonished one of my daughters, whom I
love very much," McBride said at the time.He explained that he had become concerned about his
daughter's school marks and "somewhat rebellious" behaviour, and had
admonished her, but never assaulted her.SOURCE: NEWS24
