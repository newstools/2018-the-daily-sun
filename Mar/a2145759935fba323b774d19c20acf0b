Community forum member Afrika Ngwenya said: “These men are totally unholy. “They admitted they’re responsible for senseless deaths and divorces on behalf of their clients.”Forum members found 13 knives pinned to a marula tree and others on a bridge. A resident said: “My neighbours aren’t talking to me and claiming I’m doing evil things to them. “One thinks I’m the reason her husband left her.”One of the fake pastors said he was paid by clients to do evil things to his enemies. Mhala police station commander Colonel John Ngwenya said no case was opened.
