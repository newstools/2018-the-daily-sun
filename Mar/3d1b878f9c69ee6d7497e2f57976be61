PROTEAS coach Ottis Gibson has encouraged everybody to put their focus back on the cricket after this week's David Warner v Quinton de Kock drama. Sunday's off-field altercation between the pair saw both players fined, but the aftermath that followed the incident has seen this series hot up as it moves to Port Elizabeth for the second Test. South Africa's rivalry with Australia has always been intense, with sledging on the field and comments off of it generally fuelling that fire. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu593F8D-IXuTAJdlF2bDOYlq246C_un4MoKwTHO3YcKy9iPHQOq75sPLT9GTVF_HPmdQVfc7PrXd1kwAqaxhXplncX5gUKt8l2i1DEGFKLfWK0OZiXwwCDg4Din_UH8CV-cSl65lSI2uAgX4XUTi1GT_7dMQoZuJ8MEQJJH3cDRmTa6Fk3liSgjS5WbzpM04Abax34BzLQ48jnEFe6QZWTwdGh8SKMx2WKVT5BB2ka_Lpze_PUb2bPsfFd2z-ShmHd2LNYiQOfjzS9CRCS\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKupYOLbZLUhEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Obviously things change, but when everybody around you is chirping, I don't know if that's aggression."The second Test starts on Friday at 10:00.Like this story?
