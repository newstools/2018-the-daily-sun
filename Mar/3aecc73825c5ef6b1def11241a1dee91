EFF deputy president and Parliamentary Chief Whip Floyd Shivambu has apologised for engaging in a scuffle with a journalist on Tuesday.Â Shivambu said the scuffle was a result of circumstances which included taking of photographs and persistence "to speak to me whilst receiving documents from staff members in order to attend the Standing Committee on Finance (SCOF)".WATCH: EFF'S SHIVAMBU MOERS JOURNALIST!"Whilst I was in a hurry to attend the committee meeting, I accept that my impatience with the gentleman was inappropriate.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstg8w4pe35jg2STra0LvJHvBjQQ0ZabUnMjuZm3mCiicgv62lY-Zdr9sdeiw75lQvvDJlMse_s-zbiHojyxIrXFl-Wzhayh87mPi0Vji_v6z1gkmCf-9cu1ryiDiPZRmPmzArOTVCORU_3CrkMSAdhFtBzjoJxlvBqsoXq2-PDq0h19_TPkwEI0fHQMkGhkzvrlkBjrtF7aA1_4PAVNYgPn03VrqUisILiVUPZvEMcCY3i_74j7RCvvvt7MJ8AH_ZmE8fM4UvX3YGfn65MOSved3qzKtbo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKWKaV8orWNjEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I regret the incident and believe it should have been handled differently. I take full responsibility and apologise for engaging in a scuffle with a person I discovered after the incident is a Journalist. I will write and emaile an official apology on the scuffle because I believe it was not supposed to happen."The EFF, which I represent in Parliament and Deputy President of, upholds media freedom, and freedom of association. As a loyal member of the EFF, I fully uphold media freedom and freedom of association, and the scuffle was not meant to suppress these constitutional principles."I will not do media interviews concerning the incident because I believe there are important other issues to speak about in the public discourse, than a scuffle. Members of the media are humbly requested to use this statement as my official response and nothing else," Shivambu said in a statement.
