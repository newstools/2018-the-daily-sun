My mum was angry and sometimes she would cry. “Nothing was going well for the family.” Thoko said after they found a tombstone with a picture of a strange man at the spot where they had buried her mum, they reported the matter but officials claimed it wasn’t her mum’s grave.“They showed us a grave next to the one with the tombstone and said that was her grave but we know exactly where her grave is.” Gogo Letti’s granddaughter Prudence Simelani (35) said: “They told us the other family doesn’t want to open the grave because of their culture.” Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said they were aware of the matter. “We are engaging with the other family to agree to open the grave because we cannot do it without their permission.”
