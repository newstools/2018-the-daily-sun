<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>According to the evidence brought before court, Ben Mbhele (32) stabbed and killed Lwandle (4), Sphindile (7), Lwandile (11) and Bandile Mbhele (12) on 1 September last year. He murdered them in his house in KwaNzimakwe, Port Edward, KwaZulu-Natal.At the time he told the media the family suspected that the killer may have been a terrible enemy who used the kids to strike at the family.Sentencing Mbhele to four life sentences in the Pietermaritzburg High Court yesterday, Judge Elizabeth Law said Mbhele never showed any remorse.She said if Mbhele was remorseful he would at least have contributed financially towards the burial of the kids with the money he claimed from their funeral policies.“The act was well planned,” she said. “During identification of the children’s bodies in the mortuary, you cried as if you were also feeling pain while you knew you were the one who had committed the murders.”The judge rejected his plea for a light sentence because he was still young. “The murder was horrific and that is what should be considered,” she said.“As the uncle of the children they trusted you but you betrayed that trust by joining another person to murder them.” The evidence pointed to him when it was found that in December last year he claimed R60 000 from a funeral policy he had secretly taken out for the four kids.The kids’ eldest aunt, Phakamile Mbhele (40) said they were happy with the sentence. “He deserves it. We won’t even visit him in prison. What he did to the family was very painful and he should be punished.” She said they want an equal sentence for the second suspect (48), whose case is still ongoing in the Ramsgate Magistrates Court. The second suspect is suspected of cutting off the left ears of three of the kids to sell to an inyanga. “They did the brutal act together. They must get equal sentences,” said Phakamile.She said the tough sentence will serve as a warning that God sees everywhere, even ugly acts done in secret.
