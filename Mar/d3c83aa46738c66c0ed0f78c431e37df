SELINA Ngwenya said if she were to be given an RDP house, she could stop collecting rubbish for recycling. The 54-year-old from Langaville in Ekurhuleni, Gauteng told Daily Sun: “I started recycling after my husband died in 2001. “He asked me to stop working as a domestic worker when I was five months pregnant with our second daughter but since then, life has not been easy,” said the mum of two.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuAphoP55msVwt0YFvywQbZ5Q1rqKmbunq3gx0TJn6iEQMzzTw7nTgjt7VfJFeCNlHioZ27FFm_dn-F81-nLgwYX_mA74xLXe1fFY46IGSnRlADQEQ5-v2ZmO8DS7P12lO4YJ6ScZzlVayZoUfp_T8YfngFEDTs3WcXVcSaghP52aUOZ5Ahmbv4_UPwdxMosY_geBqz6shPNnQdFeC9vrlD0puqrTrk1VZ6j0j7YLzOJOduX8BxWMqehiwijdJG16eEb1ZAxhgq9dLbMQZ1_QSilHQouR8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEaUXkuDIK2qEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We would meet after school to collect food to take home for supper,” she said. Selina’s daughter, Zanele (23), said she was tired of seeing her mum and sister surrounded by rubbish. “My sister is 17 and in grade 10, but she doesn’t have a birth certificate.“I’ve tried cleaning their shack but they fight with me, saying I’m trying to control them.” Zanele said last year she and some neighbours cleaned the yard, but it was soon full of rubbish again. “We left all the recyclable things that actually bring in the money, but now it’s dirty again. “I was forced to erect my shack because I have a baby and I’m scared my child will get sick. Municipal officials told my mum to clean up the mess, but after they left she started collecting rubbish again.“My mum really needs help to deal with the rubbish in her shack.”
