Mamelodi Sundowns may have the depth to fulfil their dream of winning two domestic titles, but their hard-fought 2-1 Nedbank Cup win over minnows EC Bees, courtesy of Hlompho Kekana and Thapelo Morena second-half goals, proved that the chain is only as strong as its weakest link.Manqoba Mngqithi rang the changes for the clash against a modest ABC Motsepe League outfit, but the Sundowns assistant coach was certainly far from impressed with the performance of his fringe players.What was expected to be an effortless stroll into the quarterfinals at Loftus Stadium turned into a real piece of work for the PSL giants, who literally squeezed through to the next round.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu57S4RF3Ue_Y3IY1LYnfb4CpHz6niwDVMkV0nRSZS6kRpj2HFQpXTXgEC-hUgPoDEDLSI1DASgyo9wKa_sG6SZZAk_4HBTTFDEoURlZps4J5d-hJT475AkRMLBukQSRUR4L4zm9ivTDUwHTpmuANBaujbPvSNPA8-th3QBulUfCbfqH4r6U6nLCm69-k1vDTHhTblygJH2fhPrxu2pFIzEVNDGbnlBhHDR3cmXf32kG62U47ft__f-ibBdQqNFjW_BfBqByfg5DYqCyARJbjzRyA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzApfVz8g3wJZEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
