He said the app would assist with the actions to be taken when subjected to racism.The foundations said the app would include an easy form to complete and an option to download evidence. The app is pioneered by Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and will be officially launched on Thursday.“Racism is something you are taught. It doesn’t come naturally.“We want to send a strong message that we are born equal and no one should be discriminated against. The colour of your skin shouldn’t define you,” said Hanekom.The campaign runs from tomorrow until 21 March in honour of human rights month but the schools programme began yesterday. Hanekom’s visit also comes before the one-year anniversary of Ahmed Kathrada’s death.Pupils received commemorative booklets on Kathrada’s life and activism. Grade 7 pupil Kamohelo Ranchebe (13) shared her views on racism and described racial acts as a shame.Kamogelo said: “Racism is discrimination against another person and it’s wrong. “It makes me feel ashamed when I hear of incidents of racism.”
