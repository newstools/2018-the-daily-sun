Ramaphosa has insisted the process will avoid disrupting food security. “There will be no smash and grabs in our country,” he said. “Some people are already sending messages to international investors to say it’s no longer safe to invest in South Africa. “We appeal to these people to desist from instilling fear in people.”Responding to traditional leaders’ claims, he said they were consulted on issues that affected their communities.
