GOALS, goals and more goals!This is the impassioned plea from the fans as rivals Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs face off in the Soweto derby at FNB Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm).The past six derbies have produced no more than eight goals, with four goalless draws turning this history-laden fixture into a snore-feast.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstE-pANN5BG__5E17X4kMHV027eVVw9yOA8A1dpXlU4jnJqaRYgVpvLIHR6OvY1cLGYMNEuJIKvuBDWnbla7SPg35pzMPyETjKCW38ytvQaYONhvWeKbQxe1VOYKlDf_QeUg9arkerLxw-kJcdaxZT7115az663We2oRGm1V0MhRa9eQTtSpxctnNmQc0aDZy7QVCV2cBPyC69c2AQgfMBkgCN7JfHWUvIaMbGHf6DjbMmayHxdpQvCgKtLWbuxn34WlvcPF4mkcKXHYefzlMgsbg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDIOkCq3p99VEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Nobody has ever won anything by talking.  "With all due respect, we have no right to speak about that the title because it will lock the legs of our players. Let them feel free, let them express themselves. Why put pressure on them? Pressure stays with me.The host Buccaneers are second with 36 points, just a point above their rivals Amakhosi.On the other hand, Steve Komphela, who will be taking charge in his eighth Derby matches, is yet to taste out-right victory.The Chiefs coach has rightly lamented the draws, which have accounted for their third spot.But said he has a full complement of players, including Willard Katsande and in-form striker Ryan Moon to go for maximum points.Said Komphela: “We’ve played too many draws. We have played seven goalless draws. Get one goal or draw half of those matches and that’s 10 points. We’d be on 45 points, which is a championship mark. We’ve lost only three matches, but we’ve drawn too many.”Like this story?
