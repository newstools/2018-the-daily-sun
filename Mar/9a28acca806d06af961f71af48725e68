Gordhan said health professionals were chasing extra zeroes in their bank accounts rather than worrying about the treatment of their patients. He said tragedies such as Life Esidimeni continued to happen every day but they could be fixed. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvh3Fk8yk_fRM0tFUmr0d8vLgxHu0rYBJ-lcjh81aLrEN5LTnsSYC_ig3wM_G1UDAJYR6mVpju9Vs_nmCnR-Ow52McvyoiPAbdp5QMdZudqHe9RLY6rBiF0IRLZh5jxrbiU2FgStP1kb1_ntwtrxhQASmNHeR1qOFimFJp4Ymc12Cq4Df_jEE7Rh_p10nwKxYutj_tElh5OiumC6YhJdKfpEK5yLibIxQi7W6DKQ2HsZ8CsKd6Q4Elpqwu0oHnkqYMrgN5Z99Us95WEq6aVWG7as70i2uI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPnQH5yCO3tyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Former deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke is expected to announce today how much money should be awarded to the relatives of those who died in the Life Esidimeni tragedy. Section27, representing the families, has proposed R1 million for constitutional damages.
