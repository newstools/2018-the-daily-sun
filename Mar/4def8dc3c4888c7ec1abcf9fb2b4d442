His mutilated body was found floating in the Nyalazi River three days later. His liver, lips, teeth, ears, nose and brain were missing and part of his thigh was cut off. The boy’s dad said the family will get the best lawyers money can buy to prove gogo’s innocence.“She is innocent. The killers are still at large. We will support and defend her,” he said.The boy’s father added that rumour has it he will be arrested next.“I’m told that the cops are planning to arrest me and my two brothers soon. Cops are arresting the wrong people because they were bribed by the actual suspect, who is a powerful local man. We have proof but we will only show it to Community Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda. We don’t trust Mtubatuba cops anymore,” he said.Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “An investigation was conducted which led to the arrest of a relative.”Mluleki Mntungwa, Community Safety spokesman said: “Our officials will visit the family soon and report back to the MEC.”
