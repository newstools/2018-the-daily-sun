WHILE Mzansi celebrates Human Rights Day tomorrow, people living with albinism still have to look over their shoulders wherever they go.They are murdered for their body parts, which are used to make muthi. This paints a grim picture of our society and those who still use traditional healers’ services.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss-BnKvEGgT8eKcVX-HReyd1vrrp-yjryq-FnmEOZR2oBa0xoplnSXJTP7mFqG1DgogwVo3RKZrO0lcq94JEBXGkOVHz12P8l4nEfT0WYx5D9IAJU2JzgN706NfgOAuF3MudkfqSvMzRDoJJRom4WaENm9sx-VCf6AcPu3a3hBKAlv89vuhPpVJDqpc9WpaF6vAdVBOQjL7SEsOHg4E-jkzJs9Yrryq-UMqoJ5iEMgXmOknWVNWjQQwnVZTwLj-tkBLYvOgOzOjkF1XU4tMX_MqFAxELe0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKLObxKGvBsGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Her headless corpse was found last month in a shallow grave in Cullinan near Tshwane.Gabisile was found three weeks after she and her 15-month-old nephew Nkosikhona Ngwenya were kidnapped at gunpoint by three men who broke into their home in Hlalanikahle, Mpumalanga.Nomasonto Mazibuko, national director of the Albinism Society of South Africa, condemned the killings.“We don’t feel safe at all because we are now being abducted from our homes,” she said.“We need to send a strong message to the criminals. “They must know that the law will deal harshly with them.” Mazibuko said her hope was restored when a man was given a life sentence recently for killing a person living with albinism in 2015. The man’s co-accused received 20-year sentences.“The criminal justice system did its part, but more needs to be done to ensure that this never happens again,” she said.According to police reports, Gabisile and Nkosikhona’s bodies were mutilated. The kidnappers mistook Nkosikhona for another toddler in the house‚ who also has albinism. The toddler’s badly decomposed body was found on the same day as Gabisile’s.
