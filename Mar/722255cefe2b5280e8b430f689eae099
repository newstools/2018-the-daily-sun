We’ve had the whole week to study them carefully and come up with a plan of how to deal with City on the day.“For us, the preparations are two-fold. Firstly, we have studied the opponent and tried to identify weaknesses that we can exploit during the match, and secondly, we have worked on our own game and performance to make sure that regardless of what comes our way on match day, we are capable of dealing with it.”Memela hails from the Cape and is excited at the prospect of playing in front of friends and family.“I’m very happy that I’ll be playing at home, it’s not every day that you are watched by your family live at the stadium. I am excited to play in front of my mother and I want to make her and my family proud. But I also understand that I can’t afford to be carried away because my job and primary responsibility on match day is to my coaches’ instructions and to the benefit of the team.”
