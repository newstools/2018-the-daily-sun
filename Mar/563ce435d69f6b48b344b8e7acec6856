media allegations are devoid of any truth.“To put the record straight, there are no investigations nor
impending charges preferred against Minister Pravin Gordhan,” Mulaudzi said.However, Mulaudzi indicated that the Hawks and the National
Prosecuting Authority have formally charged three accused persons – Ivan
Pillay, Johann van Loggerenberg and Andries Janse van Rensburg.According to Mulaudzi, they have been issued with a summons
to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on April 9 on alleged charges of
corruption.
