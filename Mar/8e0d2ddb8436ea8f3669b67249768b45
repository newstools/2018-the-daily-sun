MOTLHOMOLA Mosweu was left breathing with his face down in a pool of blood by his alleged killers, the North West High Court heard yesterday.The accused, Pieter Doorewaard (26) and Phillip Schutte (34), left him there with strangers and drove straight to the cop shop instead.According to state witness, Warrant Officer Jeremiah Modisane, the two employees of a farm only said they came to ask for the cops to call for an ambulance. They then directed the police to the accident scene but refused to go with cops, saying they had other business to attend to.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvLkD7HkVTq41b2kpFYxlur4HikfilResTU1eNkLF1D-UGs5Cw2CSaHWKgVoRsQWaXg_v_nFHmWHIEUcBq8TtYIdEoBAouuT-Iu3PWaJOoq9lBtX4ijBTB51Ynh1TP-tdr4u3auNlomrLWJPikCWnFvQyJGZa3d3Y3CEQxhR7u2_Jg3luZaThOmqZBa3XBKk-Zz1JiY67zMwIXxrcitN9fgradWHZVYPSrcHKPUSQH_UJZIBcqXXO2fjMZKjZ3aKMVaRtmHoFom5xXNJPJGbdDruRHBJkU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzL8CBgP6_0HAEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Some of those cases were still under investigation while those that involved minors were not prosecuted as parents paid R300 and the minors were released on warning.Motlhomola’s killing led to violence in Coligny, North West, with residents torching houses and shops belonging to whites in the area. The incident took place last year on 20 April.During cross-examination the defence tried to show that the accused were concerned with the health of the boy, saying they went to the nearest cop shop to ask for help with an ambulance.Advocate Hennie du Plessis said Modisane told the accused that there was no need to go to the scene, and that he would call them if needed. Modisane denied these allegations. Du Plessis further said Modisane called to inform Schutte that he did find an ambulance.The trial continues today.
