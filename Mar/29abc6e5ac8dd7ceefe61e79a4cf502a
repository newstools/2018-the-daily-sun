Vusi Mabunda (25) said he nearly lost his job after angry residents had blocked his car. “The lives of police and motorists were on the line because there was nowhere to pass,” he said. “Properties were burned, police stations and cars stoned and burned, shops looted, roads blocked, dozens of people injured and many arrested. How can someone just lie and cause so much chaos? Mashale said the suspect would appear in Kagiso Magistrates Court on 11April. She said Krugersdorp police wanted to remind residents that making a false statement under oath was a criminal offence.
