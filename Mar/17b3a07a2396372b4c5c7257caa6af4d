ALTHOUGH Omphemetse Molamu was found guilty of crimen injuria yesterday, she will have to wait another two weeks to be sentenced. In a case that has dragged on since last July, Molamu appeared in the Midrand Magistrates Court in Joburg yesterday. She was charged with crimen injuria for posting TV personality Uyanda Mbuli’s private cellphone number online and claiming that Mbuli lived off blessers. After Molamu was found guilty, Mbuli said: “Although they have set another date for sentencing, at least I know she is guilty and has to face the sting of the law.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstFSmjqIYVBiaT2rjg43Ijl86vPrCusdYT1cBJEihBvtZxox7fvU-J2gjlTjGycRjzxtM8XDTIDE8t8odT9Ki7Zs-qu00EM29k8-jn7t40dgGk314Md57cnSJ4Vxk2vkajXBZJeHAF2IvqD0ssCocsMAsq1KzzfmdxlgrsJ9Gx2WoH9zko3HwTL8fxM0O8u5OHU6wa8eUKVj2fggzcafsX1w62hD9p_P-T_jFVvn9L1TR7MHBmzotUiHGidAtXqF1ci3l4kS6YNiY2QeaZXU20iakLzM8orVU0PVw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIwKCfFImhmlEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

She said when Molamu first posted her number online, her phone rang without stopping. “It was hectic. I would receive calls from people I didn’t know in different countries.” Mbuli said she didn’t know Molamu until she started receiving nasty messages accusing her of having an affair with her boyfriend. “I never knew nor dated her man. He owed me money and my messages to him had nothing to do with a relationship,” she said.Mbuli said it hurt that people saw her as someone who lived off blessers when she was working hard to build a name for herself in a male dominated industry.The case was adjourned to the 14 March.
