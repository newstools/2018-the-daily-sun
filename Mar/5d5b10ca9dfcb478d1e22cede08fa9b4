FAMILY members of four kids who were killed by their uncle last year said they want him to go to prison for life. And tomorrow they will finally find out if their wish has been granted when he appears in the Pietermaritzburg High Court for sentencing. Ben Mbhele (32) was found guilty after confessing to the court last Thursday that he stabbed Lwandle (4), Sphindile (7), Lwandile (11) and Bandile Mbhele (12) to death with the help of another man (48) in KwaNzimakwe, southern KZN. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvtxu1DfupIQfevdj-FDxolgFzZnfJMhbTsjBn4BG0MyXf5nzNtNciyrNKzmP7yzWcBrytElQihnJBTGq_l-V8FBgQtx9jnn2bydZh4ULX-zGr1rg2m3tOF7S7Y5bM9ZulXbOVN3uf215AMgGV4iAS8BFabyDwhoLXi78nQ6tx3DwrQU7F7H9_JR4n5zD0wuzOXsG9TGh_RTwt6Zpk3vQIw8ms5T-Vzg9AeDjWxJtADV8WAvRwPVElN3Angq7xjk02QDiTwShk7eEeDRnsWK1asZindN5E\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJxgBSkUfHtqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

His aunt, Phakamile Mbhele (40), told Daily Sun after Ben was arrested a second suspect was also bust and is now facing four counts of murder. The court heard the second suspect was accused of cutting off the left ears of three of the kids to sell to an inyanga. Phakamile said: “This man has been sobbing with us.“Whenever we prayed to God to reveal the killers, he would recite the same prayer, knowing it was him. “We do not want him in our home, at least not while he’s alive. We would prefer it if he came back in a coffin.“When he killed the kids, he was staying in another place where he had piece jobs, but after the murders he came back to us.“He made me look like a bad person because many residents thought I had known what he did and was benefiting.” She said Ben did not contribute to the kids’ burial, but his spending started becoming suspicious. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-colonel Thulani Zwane said Ben would be sentenced tomorrow but the case against the other suspect was ongoing.
