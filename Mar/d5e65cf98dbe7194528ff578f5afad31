You can only stop this if you're registered correctly to vote! Check now."The DA will speak about its land policy after major developments in recent weeks over land expropriation without compensation.Parliament passed a motion last month to start a process to amend the Constitution so as to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation.The motion was brought by the EFF leader Julius Malema and was adopted with a vote of 241 in support, and 83 against.The only parties who did not support the motion were the DA, Freedom Front Plus, Cope and the ACDP.Parliament’s Constitutional Review Committee will now consider whether to amend the Constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation and how it will be done.The DA’s Shadow Minister of Communications Phumzile van Damme tweeted about the party’s land policy as well as criticism about the EFF’s land policy on Sunday."Suspect very few actually know the EFF’s policy on land. Read. Inform yourself beyond populist soundbites. EFF wants the state to expropriate ALL land, including from black landowners & for everyone to rent from the state in a form of feudalism. All will be serfs of the state," she tweeted.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/da-leader-mmusi-maimane-to-state-the-partys-position-on-land-20180312
