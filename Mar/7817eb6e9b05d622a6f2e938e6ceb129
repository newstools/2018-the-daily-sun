THE National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams
says he's ready to inform former President Jacob Zuma, if he will be prosecuted for corruption.The Constitutional Court on Wednesday, dismissed an
application by the Council for the Advancement of the South African
Constitution (Casac), which wanted to delay Abrahams's announcement on whether
Zuma should be prosecuted in the "spy tapes" saga or not.However, should Zuma be prosecuted in the spy tape saga, it could
lead to possible charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuVWidTV90XE2IybwMB9BIfTE6F2R8NeuxC238w4Z_0OspZ2wZVtBusjBkupVTGA0nQWgavJb5j53GUlSScjn7Xl02sA9xyJ24lqNUuMZECwwAhIlqcuG_tcKv4BwWUkrcLMYBRGEGJO8vJDxXqIHmVN-DcmJE33jwKMH3efxQUJR9Kc6x_TvlPmgX6EvERXgob4YuH7j0MzULd8YHyTR791vsrTiPCE-mUidOLbhsCVuZUlFMvwTqyo4HpXhKyUYMIIhIgsX8tx0cGI41W4ycckZ3-l54\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJYFANv02LCREAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

could not give them a preview of his decision.Abrahams said he would have to first inform Zuma of his
decision before he can make a public announcement on it. "There is no special treatment afforded to former president
Zuma," said Abrahams."It is not a matter of going to knock on former
president Zuma's door and say: 'I'm here to inform you'," said Abrahams.
