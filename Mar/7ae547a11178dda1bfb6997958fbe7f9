The people who were building them made the mistake. It’s not my fault.”Ntombifuthi said she had been in hospital when the RDPs were built. “I was discharged after three months and when I came back I found two houses in my yard.” She said she spoke to a local councillor about the matter but hadn’t found a solution yet.“I know other people are still waiting for their houses, but this is not my fault,” said Ntombifuthi.Lesiba Mpya, Ekurhuleni MMC for Human Settlements, said he would investigate the matter. “We will go on site to check and will try to resolve the matter as soon as possible,” he said.
