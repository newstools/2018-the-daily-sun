Minister Mildred Oliphant announced on Monday night, that the introduction of the
National Minimum Wage by May will not be possible.According to Oliphant,
the delay is because Parliament won’t be able to finalise the Bills aimed at
implementing the new policy by that date.Oliphant  mentioned that the Bills were only referred to
Parliament in November 2017.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsucwiiRogzwhotEFDPWHoUnUxkTjNuNQ1ccDL6-vVYBa-_l9oXmu9zA2kzwmoLT9wiVDjC-g4E55-IAsLDopgF6v_3LxHZVOrCh2xMrq2w4YGnpeHlOHnHEpAucvKEvqZ9EEhlAq-F6wJSIVf0CGCS-3J7kzBNpXKSD9l-NuncGcxMZWNHPLwiLr2fZOoh0T5SmJqOEOePIvjWfnvh_Q2FXMN-7U9rw7f1Mmz2dhwzZ5ZrarPs2cZf3Am_PCpGO1ohssM-7IGav_Tkv8HSlagQ-VUeuBEE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIb7G_gUhuqvEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Parliament to process the Bills," Oliphant said.The Labour
Relations Amendment Bill and the Basic Conditions of Employment Bill contains
amendments that are important to the National Minimum Wage Bill.The Bill
proposes that the National Minimum Wage be set at R20 per hour and be reviewed
annually.The minimum
wages for domestic and farm workers will initially be set at R15 and R18 an
hour respectively.This will be
adjusted to be brought on par with the National Minimum Wage within two years
of its implementation.
