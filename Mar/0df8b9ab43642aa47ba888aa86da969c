ONE of two things will happen to Stuart Baxter this weekend . . .Either he will be hailed for winning his maiden title as Bafana Bafana coach or he will face further condemnation, should South Africa fail to win the Four Nations tournament in Zambia on Saturday (6pm).Bafana are on the verge of a rare achievement, going into the final against hosts Zambia at Levy Mwanawasa Stadium.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssXS9VvJrr5BpdR-as3uI7-HnBcoG_9UnifcaNaLNFuJkZSznvy5xPU6PfQIMcnyXTJkfVC-1NTxnftXT3-SpmHyX98hcwlpQ629sHmzU3zDcvc-rMrCoNvBo9y98iJ-kmz1cUMOWNa2e2ZBUGhYuBF-UFDWwid1inDmYr2q44z1IxQbnTbXRo-D9E3rirYQfu0SqZagPsIdgHy1TjbdkDtbx8lc-iglUcsHmWr-9qvX6q77bJjyFiPjT-tZamcMgtJxyNWF5lYuWAj1XDt\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIbIH6QW1498EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

So you have to balance that. So I’d like to learn and win.“It’s a balancing act because the country wants me to win the games. We are choosing to prioritise development to broaden and strengthen our squad. If we get positive signs, that will be more valuable to me than winning each game 1-0, scraping through and not preparing us for what’s coming – the Afcon qualifiers.”Without underestimating the quality of his opponents, Baxter hinted he’ll field a new starting lineup against Chipolopolo.He said: “Zambia have a lot of players playing in South Africa and they wouldn’t want to lose to us. The team we field will be a completely different one. We need to win this game and will do everything we can to see that happen.”Baxter suffered a 2-1 friendly defeat to Zambia last June in his second game in charge. This could be his best chance to inflict revenge on Wedson Nyirenda’s team.
