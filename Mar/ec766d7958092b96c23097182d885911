HOME AFFAIRS is ready for the movement of thousands of people across Mzansi’s borders.This was announced by Minister Malusi Gigaba during a press briefing in Tshwane yesterday. He said during peak periods like the Easter weekend and Christmas, a high number of people moved through Mzansi’s ports of entry and this posed security risks.Gigaba said some of the issues faced by border control authorities included the illegal stamping of travel documents by corrupt officials and the illegal entry of people and goods as part of organised crime.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvT4qUWBYn86VqJAlafwaRcbBlH8krBjdDcexUkYtVfiLsq41HrhBwYPHB8wcGSgPi3kW2G2X-mPGSw15n2TWORop_Nb7sJWb_Ekkc40a0O0mnzXW3YKAadSuWsiGZDIXnH7AzN8LPu9x6Vn8Hn0z8qlhyaxz8svrGvMCfmiGsxJen1NLRC2j7MIpZ89uM3L_v2ELj_BsLv6rgHAHQyVZzA9wL9FuSsZl9EmqahPFihBPyffnxBQ7cjGQJ29n_1MQwX0c8EvtzW3QMb0QK-TasTG_3314g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDyOdKf3FfphEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But border police ensured that port officials operated in a safe and secure environment and regular patrols were conducted.“The deployment of intelligence members at major ports of entry has led to the discovery of 29 fraudulently obtained South African passports, seven fraudulently obtained birth certificates, two fraudulent IDs, 13 fraudulent Lesotho passports and three fake immigration stamps used by a Zimbabwean at the Beitbridge border,” he said.  “It is also known that there are taxi drivers who arrive at the ports with large numbers of illegal passports.”  “I have approved the extension of operational hours for selected ports of entry experiencing a significant increase in movement,” he said. Gigaba said the operating hours at border posts will be extended until next Friday.
