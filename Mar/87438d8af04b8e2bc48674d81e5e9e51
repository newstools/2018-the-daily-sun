The People’s Paper has learnt that the protest started on Monday night. A small group of residents apparently threw stones at vehicles on the N2 highway.  A motorist who felt his life was in danger is said to have fired shots, which left two people seriously injured. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said two cases of attempted murder were opened at KwaDukuza Police Station. KwaDukuza municipal spokesman Sipho Mkhize said the protest was illegal. “We appeal to the people using closed routes to use alternative ones,” he said.
