MAMELODI Sundowns have been drawn in Group C of the CAF Champions League Cup. The Brazillians are in the group stages of the tournament for the third consecutive year, but will not have it easy if they want to finish in the top two to make it into the next round of the tournament.Pitso Mosimane's charges were drawn in the same Group with AS Port from Togo, Horoya and Wydad Casablanca from Guinea and Morocco respectively, and will need to get results against all three if they're going to manage to secure a spot in the quarterfinals in September.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssfq8jxm3b1PLEi_RZfORiAwYkGbIM5lEr2FhKy4gHoWhWfuNWlaIdnUNeWj5hssQDYW-VNsv5Poth2KUQ6b7xoQqw0dMw1oADrZChuZMQfJHdiUjyKWFsozgQ-gohr3btv6o9EbsIUoNB-m-JuQ-MVLI65RL0RLhDH6XdDxUb0Dp7BdLGbj9nmHBuMPcITt1hhGiyDZbFRU47DvHWe9uI2XZhoe3FEZ5GeA6upfzrp7is9VM7AM2qNBs4vkbQntGcXuP14LPr0q_w_svxK\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCaKvLmGBYTAEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
