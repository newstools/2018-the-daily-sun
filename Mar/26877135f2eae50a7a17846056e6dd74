The charges relate to the R30 million paid to Gupta linked company Mediosa before any work had been done. It was promised R180 million more. Buthelezi Ambulances is allegedly paid millions monthly by the bankrupt health department. North West Hawks spokesman Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said: “I can confirm it’s a fraud and corruption case. The parties concerned will not be revealed by us at this stage.”There have been calls for Mahumapelo to fire Lekalakala since he admitted to going on a trip to India paid for by the Guptas.However the Mediosa contract was signed by the premier. EFF provincial legislature member Alfred Motsi called on the ANC to remove Mahumapelo or his party would table a motion of no confidence in him. ANC members have also called for the premier to be investigated for a number of corruption allegations. Motsi told Daily Sun: “Radical economic looting by Supra is a clear reason why he forced North West delegates to the ANC conference in December to vote for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. He wanted to be protected from prosecution. “The ANC must remove Supra or we’ll assist them through a motion of no confidence.” Mahumapelo’s spokesman Brian Setswambung said the premier was aware of the case. “Dr Lekalakala is on special leave and investigations are taking place,” he said.
