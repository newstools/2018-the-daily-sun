SUNDAY’S closing Nedbank Cup quarterfinal fixture between Cape Town City FC and Mamelodi Sundowns at Cape Town Stadium (3pm) will not be about the coaches but the players.The Citizens coach Benni McCarthy expressed his delight yesterday that he would be meeting up with his friend, Pitso Mosimane of Downs, saying “the fight is on the field, not on the bench”.Joked McCarthy yesterday after their afternoon training session: “This will not be a Benni versus Pitso match. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstRD-6sLFBmU5Dn5GaZTPIMfX9mZvVsozbRUCuT3tPZnlvgD7chsjBq6OO7junFbulFYamJo1nQVj3TFFmOwN_f57yhKX_CWyoKP3psieHSmXSSPoLXAGe19aUHC9-VCS0RobOwA4y6smIjsLcfMjpFccyV2aRwqxFzGchxUzp6WnSqLzR4kPwzlht8T-aADXBDnWFLrZ3GwejkichJJKYNI_wOJLnYZRyrtBjoeTntAAs91N082yDYfqdThi53Rfc7j08F-Ic-Sj9IejdJKH5xSg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJDgyAyNouCpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We can only guide from the bench. But the mood in my camp is good. All the players are looking forward to this game.”This will another tough nut to crack for McCarthy and his charges after their slender 1-0 win over Orlando Pirates in the Last-16 round at the same Cape venue.“I can’t say we are going to beat them but we will be at our best,” he added.“My players resumed training yesterday after I gave them some days off due to the Caf matches.”City were knocked out of the Caf Confederation Cup by Costa do Sol at the Athlone Stadium this past weekend, which means they have turned their attention to the Ke Yona Cup.
