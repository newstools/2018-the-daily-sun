that there was danger ahead.Abel Mavasa cries foul after his bakkie crashed into an uncovered storm drainage system.      Meanwhile, Mavasa says he was excited when he heard that there was development on the 3 kilometre Ring Road, which links the village and Malamulele.He said his high hopes came crashing down, when he crashed
to a hole of uncovered storm drainage system."Since my Toyota Stallion got damaged in the incident, I'm
unable to sustain myself because it was my only source of income and both the
contractor and the Municipality are not willing to assist," Mavasa said.The local councillor Steve Mahlale confirmed that the incident
happened, however he said the municipality has advised Mavasa to claim for liability from Ndhuna Construction's insurance.The councillor said the matter is between Mavasa and the
insurance company.
