Sports Minister Tokozile Xasa could launch a forensic investigation into the financial affairs of the South African Football Association (Safa). The Safa presidential nominee Ace Ncobo has petitioned the minister to investigate allegations of financial mismanagement at the football’s governing body. Barely a month in office, Xasa might be faced with her biggest task yet, amid growing calls for reforms at Safa.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvOZan_h4AcdHQr1R_jpbRiWa9vwqSEqLCyui2wvcKTUhop0PHS03khsMMY0imNvsGxC_DQly6UF9cbS0BKVQodKYvI38EparGw237aupe78njWPRefZ2kf3JgrngqpPM4M1U_BuUMNBOxvfela7yWIn5kIPtI3o2wvA6SYvzfCPrQliIBUra-GidSQLgOdFqbsJCyUriNpwXnr2InehgXvoJ9FtOLz5Sei_iEYgcid8hQWWz9V2qY9czqes4kt4H6B-5dA3GuUlqfW4Vy4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMD3shCCW4-JEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They are also unable to pay salaries and travelling expenses of the executive committee members.”Ncobo has launched a bitter war against Safa and he scored victory when the Safa elections were cancelled. Ncobo has also waged war against Safa president Danny Jordaan, whom he says must vacate his post. Safa CEO Dennis Mumble has not been spared as well with Ncobo saying he too must resign. On Friday night, Ncobo alleged that Mumble’s contract as the admin head was coming to an end on 31 March and that should mean his tenure at Safa must come to an end. Safa spokesman Dominic Chimhavi said they were not worried about those allegations.“Anyone can come up with untested accusations. They will have to give the minister proof. They are very upsetting because they do not have any merit and can only be made by desperate individuals. We won’t even entertain them,” said Chimhavi.“About the 2010 Legacy fund, that trust is presided by Fifa board of directors and no cent can be spent without getting an okay from Fifa. The allegations are baseless. Our financial books are open for perusal by any person because we have nothing to hide,” he added.
