They still have to make fires to cook as they don’t have electricity.Gogo Mamosala said: “I am tired of being told lies by our leaders. I am old and God can take me any time. I hoped to have moved into a decent house before I died. “I have seen everyone around me getting RDP houses and prayed for the fall of Zuma. Ramaphosa is my last hope,” said gogo.“I pray he will help me with a decent house with electricity for me to watch TV and listen to the radio.”Centlec spokesman Lele Mamatu said they would install power at gogo’s home.
