MTHATHA Bucks players understand the pressure situation they could find themselves in if they fail to beat Uthongathi FC on Saturday (3.30pm). The teams will meet in a National First Division (NFD)  relegation battle at Mthatha Stadium. Bucks are languishing at the bottom of the NFD table with 20 points from 23 matches. They might well be playing in the ABC Motsepe League next season if they fail to win their remaining three matches.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvwianwvKnCf8HpcL4DoZ9ZiIqP5cnD8oMZICRYxsnq91c5EEIjEIv7ykng6HhAFBE8m01YbGyH96CrEz2xofM2tCF6x_nyZS96XajWvxV-ywKCGJaA9hzykiwK-oRHRVfFE765rrsD1TmVG9Qjz0VifCRpONopnpziggU3T6ukYL2ajpXyn4IfVnijlTW3THw_vRMM6hZhRuj0tMzsjJ2v6nKRNWJ626vvc7NfoyaHksgiwupISedlXwOxFp3wCFCSbOJvIPQkW9b2DKibqpswOQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNX5kW_6rZkLEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

If we cannot do it for ourselves, no one will do it for us.”Bucks and Uthongathi have met twice this season in the league’s first round and in a Nedbank Cup qualifier, Amathol’ Amnyama winning both matches with a 2-1 scoreline. This gives them the advantage over their KwaZulu-Natal rivals.However, Erasmus insists past meetings will not count in this one: “It will be a different story this time. They know what will happen if they lose and it is the same for us. Losing the game is not on our minds.”
