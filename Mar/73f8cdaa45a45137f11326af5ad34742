to South Africa for a private visit earlier, but it is not clear if he is still
in the country."The report also claimed that workers at the veteran
politician’s residence in Harare had been "taken in for questioning by
soldiers on Wednesday morning".Meanwhile, there were unconfirmed reports that Mugabe was
in South Africa for a meeting with former education minister Jonathan Moyo and
other members from the Generation 40 (G40), according to Bulawayo24.This came as tensions were mounting in Zimbabwe after
Mugabe last week expressed support for the National Patriotic Front led by
former cabinet minister and ally Ambrose Mutinhiri. Some officials in the
ruling party have rounded on Mugabe for that, accusing him of trying to
destabilise Zanu-PF. https://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/mugabe-flies-to-sa-amid-mounting-tensions-in-zimbabwe-reports-20180308
