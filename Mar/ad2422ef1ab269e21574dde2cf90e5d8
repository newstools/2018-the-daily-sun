ONE of the men accused of killing five cops has launched a bid to be released on bail.During his bail application yesterday in the Ngcobo Magistrates Court, Kwanele Ndlwana (22) told the court he wanted bail so that he could explain to his sister, who was married to Thandazile Mancoba, what had happened on the day five cops were massacred at Ngcobo Police Station.Mancoba is one of seven brothers who were running the controversial Seven Angels Church.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssfZwmz3kxSui7Qu0wJYhLhdKbxGLSj_liq3747j_zwZebAzzCqdYICYxr3aRW0wOD-U-yMal62qugFdc22MrQXnNL_47BaItbQKTcESRmtSNN94nCG8OXg-U5hlfw533XZ6fw9J6-nWqAbOMxjQp5go-2907JQIoDyiY5B5eXtf9W0ai-zNd_91qBuigBvBic9KyUXgHQCNw2QR8iPbx1ma-ibZgoFDelNwR9-0QoxSRAOFm_HxILO-K4wC_4ebqYiL1bFg6wNBRI7UxHlfsheVYceLVI\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YTTTv-muutbDpi6d95dh5Yx28jn_oLYUThzQ9go8LpEmCftdcBEDUwjmAYuZBlw2VKAlshDmPgs0Ckyczpu4TqhQVXL59jreIR09G9e0g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBjAN35O4ODfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Ndlwana also told the court the guns used in the attack had been stolen from cops.“One of the guns was stolen from a cop in Butterworth and another one from a cop in Cala,” he said. Ndlwana said he was taken care of by the church and given money to buy clothes, but he was not sure where the money came from.When state prosecutor Nomapha Mvandaba asked how the church got money, seeing that members were not allowed to work, he answered: “The Lord would show us what to do to survive.” When Mvandaba asked him if he could afford bail, Ndlwana said his mum said she could pay R5 000.Asked whether he would try to kill more cops if he was released on bail, Ndlwana said: “I have no intention of killing a cop.”
