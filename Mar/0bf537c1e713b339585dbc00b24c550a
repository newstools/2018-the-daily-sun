She was in and out of contract. I want to state it on record that she was never fired from the show. “She was informed that her storyline was coming to an end, but declined the contract extension.”Shona said the discussion and disagreement happened three months ago. “We’re not in a position to explain why she turned down our offer,” he said. “She’s the one who can explain well as to why she refused to take our offer.” According to two insiders, Mara’s storyline was cut short after it emerged that she had stopped shooting three months ago. Claimed the informant: “Mara stopped shooting with The Queen months ago. “We’ve learnt she had dumped the show without explaining herself.“But it was clear from the beginning that somehow, something happened that didn’t sit well with her.” Asserted the other source: “Mara had achieved what she wanted to achieve, but it was really a shock to learn that she had left, especially as she was one of the viewers’ favourites. Anyway, life goes on.”When contacted, Mara confirmed she had left The Queen. Insisted Mara: “Yes, I declined to take their offer because they treated me like trash.“I was on a global contract for a year, which was supposed to expire in May. “Those people decided to come to me in September to tell me they had terminated my contract because the producers of the show had run out of ideas for my storyline.“With my experience in the showbiz industry and age, you can’t treat me like a nobody.”
