The Bank of Baroda told the North Gauteng High Court on
Thursday that Gupta-owned companies cannot force it to stay in South Africa to
service them because no other bank will. Nineteen Gupta-owned companies, including Optimum Coal Mine,
Sahara Computers and Oakbay Investments, approached the High Court with an
urgent application in February, seeking to interdict the bank from leaving
South Africa. The Guptas’ banking woes started in 2017 when all four of
the country’s major banks declined to do business with the controversial
family’s companies. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsunJsrhHWKomwG7zr5VwFFLCgpfIT6POfGcfAcnK5U4gMomOCmdwQRIXjhU5Rq0uyac2BTpiyCTIUaFrdK3nzV-o3EpUCtEhoMIMsuvaR5mJRD5l1p1Kwb-O567mTauBt4ZjtXv7qgPrUfwOKGqidE1G2B9jS73u8_gESXUq8gB_yHOHEo4Mo7QRAhwO-F8UdDo5mvEl2PPhKdaovVdqD4l1dMBvH1CVz7wnmDybhUdSN229H1Z41uLCxXwwmcxWAMpR6bdSgBxjH2VqWdZOeAh11j45Cw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJYSi1_vxJ-pEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

to withdraw from South Africa as business was no longer economically
worthwhile. He said the Bank of India, which is the majority shareholder of the
Bank of Baroda, took a decision to withdraw from countries where little
business is conducted. Bham added that a company is entitled to cease contractual
business, and there can be no contractual right to keep providing services to
another business if it becomes uneconomical. He likened the application by the Gupta companies to a
failing marriage where one party refuses a divorce because of their own
interests.  “You cannot force
Bank of Baroda against its will and against its economic interests to stay here
and service them and only them,” said Bham. The application wants to force the bank to keep servicing 12
or 13 companies because no other bank will do business with them, he said.  Advocate Arthur Cook, for the Gupta-owned companies, told
the court that the bank's withdrawal from the company was a deliberate breach
of a court order. The court order he is referring to is an interim order
granted by the same court in 2017 stipulating that the Bank of Baroda may not
close the accounts of Gupta-owned companies. “We submit that the bank took a decision that is a blatant
disregard of the court order,” Cook said. “The court order says they cannot
stop the services and close accounts.”Cook argued that closing the bank accounts would not only be
in contravention of the court order, but would also have severe negative
consequences for employees at the affected companies. News24 previously reported that it was a Bank of Baroda
account that received the money from the infamous Vrede dairy project.Judge Ntendeya Mavundla reserved his judgment saying that
the fundamental question he must answer is if a court can keep the bank in the
country, open and operating against its own will. Judgment will be delivered on March 12.
