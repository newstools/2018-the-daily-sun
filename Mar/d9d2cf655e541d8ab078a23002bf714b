Mthatha-born singer and songwriter, Moneoa has opened up about the depression she experienced when she made the decision to take a break from music.The songstress says she was in a very dark place and found it difficult seeing everyone around her elevate in their careers while she wasn’t making the progress she so desperately wanted.“I lost hope and cried myself to sleep. I was in an incredibly dark place and I thought that if this was me, then maybe I wasn't supposed to make music anymore. Maybe it had run its course. I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel,” she told TshisaLive.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstm_5vad3ANN3RLlIRIf2gsk1KaKuMRj_bXlV5ZaKAHsY3ovXU7gVTBGh41_rUArdFvrEq5m8N9s2He8X8Zalz69cidqV14eP7M3ZPhYsVLiYbVtlsfuG-Smp9bHCD7kBT1ks2AxQVCm0nG4-J95VxAqncCrR3gA1jRnglfy1sJlvahAuknNpu8Roa-woqxxj17f9wLEf_tGdD-8uUDYxETdZKcEfr4cxBGTdYpC0et_FZm00CUkBAsoa__d7mqMymz_SjWvRDUU5yAOFM29wihy26dXp_y8uJwFw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNBR-DOWrnTGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I was giving my everything but watching it all fall apart,” she said.Moneoa has been on a two-year hiatus of the music game has but is slowly making a come back.She recently released a remake Ziphi Inkomo.
