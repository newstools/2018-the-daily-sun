The DA has asked the Public Protector to investigate RDP contracts in the Free State awarded to a company in which the daughter of outgoing premier Ace Magashule owns a stake.The contracts were awarded to the company by the provincial Department of Human Settlements after Magashule became involved in a process that resulted in a rival contractor being booted off the project. News24 on Wednesday revealed that Unital Holdings, in which Magashule's daughter, Thoko Malembe, 27, is a 30% shareholder, secured contracts worth R150m to build more than 1 000 RDP houses near Bethlehem in the eastern Free State.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssuGvHzTGI097-PsB8Klx0JN6S8JYrV62A50vCeOK7-lDSdVizphpORiEJlyXldWRSO-CMCJ8oJcHz7UtY0vTz_G75L0EESe4MEK44ofE0vmU44bNOOSSxwE293xq1WYL9Dna50VFu17NCVmBU_CXvZ_PAzNYNqd4PA6ocgD0ZoToviuTvAotGp3gXZ-yPfpE8Q_mBZ9DP0dVSYAEXK73B8vm2Ky3fGa3ujirgMYrA4erMLQPECzHEXdRXGKiPL6jBrm2BWWIkIZNNM0gy2tzICshkVp0s\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBAhoZL0zfWDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
