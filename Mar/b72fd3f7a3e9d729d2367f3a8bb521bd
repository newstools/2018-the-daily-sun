The DA has asked the Public Protector to investigate RDP contracts in the Free State awarded to a company in which the daughter of outgoing premier Ace Magashule owns a stake.The contracts were awarded to the company by the provincial Department of Human Settlements after Magashule became involved in a process that resulted in a rival contractor being booted off the project. News24 on Wednesday revealed that Unital Holdings, in which Magashule's daughter, Thoko Malembe, 27, is a 30% shareholder, secured contracts worth R150m to build more than 1 000 RDP houses near Bethlehem in the eastern Free State.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst_OGjXJ-toR8DdtUtuwH4QMSiICNx00iTcF3hYLKXemF-rdPw5Zp-QOzhCB5ZTsUx8esBnXjPG8XNL30vzXaK-T5oKrjrCDOW_sGIyQRrtqhn4q8r7_IopeMfRIy8pCRPrN5Gtv3Q1LNnN7fevkKDJeoGHTQbuqGzFfrTDI0XyK9wKy0zwwtCVLg4NIYfTkVucIdpJls-ypjvGmEkaIhCtMpZszEt_5idJdzn2CoL5Au9vox4QlYsnvK12P-IPto1cdb74B117lKviRLM7Y7WKww-wie0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGn16L9XitBGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
