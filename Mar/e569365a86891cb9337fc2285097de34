They then went outside. But instead of leaving the yard, they turned back and pulled out guns.”She said the men held her sister-in-law and her baby at gun point. “Two other men entered the house and the four took our phones and TV.” She said when the men returned, she was in the bathroom. “I wanted to scream for help, but decided against it as I could hear the men screaming at my sister-in-law to shut up and for the child to stop crying.” The incident left the family in shock and they will be going for counselling. Gloria has opened a case at the Linden cop shop.People took to social media to sympathise with the actress. Ntokozo Dlamini said: “At least they’re okay. Shame. She’ll overcome this soon and be fine.”Bintikombo? said: “Sorry, Gloria.”Nothando Cele said: “Crime never ends. Hope her son will be OK.”Captain Tinyiko Mathebula said a case of house robbery has been opened and no one has been bust.
