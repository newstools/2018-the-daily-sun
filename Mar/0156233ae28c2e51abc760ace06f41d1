They said they wanted the government to do more to protect them. Pat Khumalo, a spokesman for the patrollers, said: “To the patrollers who lost their lives, thank you for taking steps to protect the community. Your deaths will not be in vain. “We will fight and make sure the next MEC visits your families and pays respect.” The patrollers handed over a memorandum of demands to Mxolisi Xayiya on behalf of Premier David Makhura. The patrollers also demanded protection and employment from the government. “Volunteers are exposed to danger and are not supposed to complain or raise their concerns.“The number of patrollers who have died on duty is higher than those who died at Life Esidimeni.” Khumalo said the MEC promised to employ patrollers but it never happened. “Many of our comrades have died because all they have are reflectors.” Patroller Freddie Ntlangethwa (35) from KwaThemba, Ekurhuleni said the biggest danger they faced was being shot at while only wearing reflectors. “We are not scared to die though.”
