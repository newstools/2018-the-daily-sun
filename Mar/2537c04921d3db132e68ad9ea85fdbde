THE only thing standing between Lungile Gongqa and his Old Mutual Two Oceans ultra marathon title defence is himself. Gongqa is not worried about anyone, not even the strong competition from neighbouring countries Lesotho and Zimbabwe. The Nedbank running club athlete is confident that he will be able to defend his title in the gruelling 56km race in Cape Town on Easter Saturday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvF7M3cBQwP-K19sLLWh8DcnqChi8QhFmc3u5vmiHOFaBTmOeoa-djwBRx2coYIjQdfs790n1bpvEeWYvkFVax2_5B3QgWf0ZgL72A5FdersBUaBEV-XojIBXCziJ5mTKBfA6nrA9wESHpZ0OC0zMcxyf1Ht9ldG1_FnEIsHrbOwvMUAo2QCNuiESPs0FG2Sj5wHCCkb1rwTbDREzXT_xyy0Ecaf7W9HpmjcIH6uZ-7MfWWbhJfrgMgdZHr1vzDqllA8gxW1PBqn864N6Wg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDgIncwC7G6aEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

There is a water shortage in the Mother City and Nedbank has confirmed that it will be bringing along water from Joburg. But not even the water crisis bothers the Eastern Cape born runner, as he is firmly focused on retaining his title. Gongqa took the men’s 56km title in 3:09:38 in 2017. His clubmate, Maryna Damantsevich from Belarus, won the women’s race in 3:37:08. But he foresees a faster race this year and believes that the time he ran last year would not be quick enough this year to win what is considered to be one of the toughest races in the world. Clubmates such as Mike Fokoroni from Zimbabwe, Ludwick Mamabolo, Claude Moshiywa and Mthandazo Qhina are some of the contenders that will be hoping to wrest the title from his grasp. But the former Sanlam Cape Town Marathon title holder appears to have a solid plan going into the big race. Gongqa said: “I just want to better last year’s winning time. “I have a feeling that it wouldn’t be enough to get me that top spot this year. It’s going to be a fast paced race. “I’m going to go according to my own training. There will be runners looking to break the record and others who will want to stick with the leading bunch. ” The records of Thompson Magawana and Frith van der Merwe, set in 1988 and 1989 respectively are still standing. Magawana clocked 3:03:44 in 1988, while Van der Merwe stopped the clock on 3:30:36 a year later. The sponsors introduced a whopping R1 million bonus in 2014 for the man and woman able to break the records. Gongqa says it’s never easy to defend a title, but he will give it his best shot: “It’s easy to find yourself outside the top 10 the year after winning a marathon.”
