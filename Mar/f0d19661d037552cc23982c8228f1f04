New Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan on Tuesday
revealed that his immediate focus would be on revitalising state-owned entities
(SOEs) and reversing the tide of state capture that has gripped key sectors of
the economy.The appointment of new boards at several public entities,
including operational changes, was expected in the next three weeks, Gordhan
told members of the Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) at a
conference in Pretoria."It won't be an easy task, nonetheless it is not
impossible," he said, adding that change was expected in state power
utility Eskom following the appointment of a new board.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv8h-M5jhZWubA9jyImg-JwIZyVdAeaxioChW3Kpc0_YDOhYbEJPPv_2oDzqH9C8O9OCecX122zQ5t--iQWKrqmkMJsMpl_OXPwpusJdu9RHr3Q5C8fbuwkqk5sL_mTIRvep4IYBXMxauYna2cfe_9lhBplJSS_fzIkFW910lqw-Arhb3CszueULm9e8S53J3kOMuLOtXDTIpzOSw4BiQA0uACMM9Hfkytdp6Qc8GCEUe_WTOEwUC5_6dMH6OMsNy0HZz7xc9QvQoZV2Z4lOz_V4SzsCEw\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YRP9X9EoocfD5NJFrWn0uKj_VLvFWtNRWzvqRPxHgHxEWZM0a5CnKHR0hy8zM81cNfe53fRZG_v1gT3JZyST-EPGEMDh2bB2urzs6WW\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHNOGCNXKxBsEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

to function in the public interest, not just to serve a few people," said
Gordhan.The financial management of public enterprises such as
Eskom, South African Airways and rail agency PRASA has been blamed for putting
pressure on the fiscus, with billions of rands in guarantees extended to the
entities to help them stay afloat. "A good team at Eskom needs to assure South Africans
that they would work to keep costs under control," he said. "Given 3
to 6 months, we will begin to see some positive signs."'Tough ride'Gordhan, who was named public enterprises minister on
February 26, stressed that rooting out corruption and transforming state-owned
enterprises was going to be a "tough ride".Treasury has issued R350bn in government guarantees to
Eskom, of which over R200bn has been utilised, as the troubled state power
utility has battled to rein in bulging operating costs.The poor state of Eskom's financial affairs has seen its
long-term corporate rating downgraded by Moody's in November to Ba3, a third
notch below non-investment grade.The ratings agency placed Eskom on review for a further
downgrade.Late last month rival ratings agency S&P downgraded
Eskom's long-term debt to 'CCC+', the seventh rung of non-investment grade,
with a negative outlook. Gordhan said he anticipated that those involved in state
capture would try to "sabotage" efforts of reversing the damage and
transforming the state."The damage is not something that happened overnight
[...] we are on a good wave in South Africa and it is possible to re-capture
the state and re-orientate these institutions," he said.SOURCE: NEWS24
