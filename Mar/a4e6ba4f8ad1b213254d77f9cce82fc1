MAMA Esther’s Haven used to be a home for orphans and poor kids but today, it’s a pile of ashes. The centre in Msholozi, just outside White River in Mpumalanga, was burned down by angry residents on Tuesday during a protest over the construction of a school. Fuming residents blocked all roads into the area and the R40. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuEtcYB5SVugYhCQzrj-VhwdN6XZ17cz6z6Pvl-SKOPv6eY1NshYX8OLIRI5-HfAl9Kqgf7ZGkLi-ROt1aS49AyJ1kcMBhm-dBQTSkNglVxMQ3kIa-Z_PxuJ4rvhOQWKHBeIB2x-rqqrreQZJzfm4NM_dsBUVxoVlBr-SeQrh2-vmVfP5MfaaDc06DICk794dEdbmTw2G7v9zRHT2RY5W4rgkQLmyND_9SViftGU8UG0EfX-hP8-GhBW3wTg1m9GJH4KaDbT5Ie-DdefMLdSoL3c4rJokQ\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YTBRpCgRzyUk9QzD3jQU-EqtvESRfqM9gtjZi4fRUYFsqnDfhPWweMnljMGLrIg6VyeyINQwF7P8UKMqWqWJABj7JtV_8pYk6ZbHeyanQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNZdUw83TUSfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The centre was told to close by the North Gauteng High Court last month after an eight-year-old boy was raped there in October.Sources told the SunTeam residents were outraged by an attempt by unknown people to sell the centre’s building illegally.A source said: “Burning the centre will not solve anything. We need is a proper school for our kids and we want the education MEC to visit us.” Education department spokesman Gerald Sambo acknowledged there was a need for a school in the area. He said a site had been identified for a new school and the process of establishing Msholozi as a registered township had been started by the Mbombela Municipality. “Planning and resource allocation for the school will start after the completion of the township establishment process. “Site donation and confirmation still has to be done by the rightful owner of the land the school will be built on,” he said. White River police spokeswoman Sergeant Cynthia Mbokodo said four people were injured during the protest and rushed to Rob Ferreira Hospital for medical treatment. “We have made several arrests and opened a case of malicious damage to property,” she said.
