She appeared to be asking for help. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst1yoNPPFUx9AaX84ZG5yU0Dgb5h3-9lp32zJKZuYHDJdCoaJCF9be-rJSkTYGVi92YSg0ZCq3i1OXyoTbwEYbDIX_HMKkzmZNsuiVR_gR5sJnrkXW-HiwAQBsaB9_2u6SurRgYoEMF2Yv9KhABbuaOogmL1SLapO_GOf_hXa2iVL2M6CQfv3WDPZFrGhfWdpbWVq1wDTcd-dbIaEt5kYPahL7XZk18SI9cbZ-TObPWYlyOTrgX2HR-y1C3Dd6xr4FclIzcXjci3TfeGV-d0jClXUJREJQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzG9P_3yoTIZLEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Immediately after stopping her car, the half-naked woman disappeared and a man popped up out of the bush. He was wearing a balaclava and pointed a firearm at her.Sedibe said the suspect got into the car and instructed the woman to drive towards the Injaka dam. He invited his friend to come along. “When they got there the victim tried to escape but the suspect fired a shot, forced her to undress and they both took turns raping her. They robbed her of an undisclosed amount of money, a cellphone and other belongings, and then fled in a green VW Citi Golf,” said Sedibe.No one has been arrested and police are looking for the suspects, including the woman who appeared to be asking for help. Anyone with information that could lead to the suspects’ arrest is urged to call Constable Dolly Marule on 072 969 1985 or phone the SAPS Crime Stop number 08600 10111.
