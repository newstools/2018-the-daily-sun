DITAU Primary School in Orlando East, Soweto, is falling apart!  No wonder pupils and teachers at this school fear for their lives. Teachers told Daily Sun the ceiling is crumbling and they’ve had to stop lessons midway at times.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu9715hKPy4JjWzPqxaXzpter9qTrHJAekWu7dHJLSuaz4ShX1DjTUdD3M8Nqm4Fa3XSJQnEJJ95VD4LUR1Ngd2RHQp286MO1idDTBE5qxZrn1qqFaDvWTnQwAeFjnUyphNJ7Ax4iGPHr7Fo3o6mjuqvBJvwmJKQHjEvtTCDZfXP-Q444-dsRUm05mKiS4O2b5sHeFYBBhDbRyssrT5ILU864mk0yV-xEah9EFTfyZ533heDQTUqZUnYQRTLff4oKKwt1DthADBGNwooAX927z0cHwi9Og\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKm4UZzuvGGeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Our lives are at risk.  “It’s worse when there’s rain. All we do is wait and watch out for falling ceiling pieces.”  When the SunTeam visited the school recently, the ceiling and classroom walls had big holes in them.  Teachers said kids suffer in winter. Some classrooms don’t have windows. The school was built in 1943 and, according to the teachers, little maintenance has been done over the years.  Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said there were plans to renovate the school.  “The department has made budgetary provisions for the school,” he said.  He said there are plans to eradicate all asbestos at schools in Gauteng, and Ditau is one of these schools.  “We’re exploring the possibility of adding mobile classrooms in the meantime,” he said.
