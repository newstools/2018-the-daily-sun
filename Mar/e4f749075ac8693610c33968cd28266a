THE FACTS Dlezakhe Mfuphi from Kya Sands, Joburg said he and others had been employed through a labour broker since 2014. In 2015, the labour broker changed and the new broker took them over with shorter shifts. Because they get paid by the hour, the shorter shifts mean they are earning less money. They also complained they have been casual workers since 2014 and that the company is refusing to make them permanent. They want to know what recourse they may have.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>WHAT I DID I spoke to SCORPION LEGAL PROTECTION for their professional legal adviceSOLUTION If the reader and other employees were transferred as an ongoing concern then the new labour broker should have inherited their contract of employment as it was. This means their conditions of employment remain the same including their working hours. Any change in their working conditions by the labour broker constitutes unilateral variation of the contract of employment and thus unfair labour practice. This can be challenged by referring an unfair labour practice dispute at the CCMA to compel the labour broker to restore the working conditions as existed prior to the unilateral change. If their contracts of employment were not transferred as an ongoing concern to the new labour broker then it means they had to start as new employees of the new labour brokers. If the new broker had to introduce short time to save jobs this is within his rights. The alternative to short time is retrenchment and this will leave the readers without a job. Regarding the complaint that they have been casual workers since 2014, the Labour Relations Act states that the employer can employ employees on a fixed term contract of longer than three months only if the work is of limited duration and the employer has justifiable reasons for the fixed term contract. Any employment in contravention of this section is deemed to be permanent. This means if the new broker can’t justify why the readers are employed as casual for longer than three months they will be considered as permanent employees. Our reader and his colleagues can therefore refer a case of Unfair Labour Practice to the CCMA against the labour broker and the broker’s client.
