It’s not looking good at all.” Linda said the family doesn’t have money for the funeral.She said they need help to bury their kids in the family’s home town of Qoboqobo Village, Eastern Cape.“The fact that we have to bury three people makes it even harder for us.” Councillor Anda Ntsodo said they could only help if the kids were going to be buried in Cape Town.“We are waiting for the family to tell us what they are going to do. If they agree to bury the kids in Cape Town, we will start making preparations,” said Ntsodo.
