But she hadn’t yet changed the name on her ID to her husband’s name.When her mum decided to apply for a new ID with her marital surname a couple of years after Chwayita was born, she discovered that her husband had divorced her and the ID application was denied.Chwayita said when her mother applied for her birth certificate, officials told them their surnames didn’t match. She said they explained their problem but they were sent from pillar to post. She said the school tried to assist her to get the certificate but the attempts failed.“It’s as if I don’t exist. My life has been completely put on hold. I don’t know what to do any more.”Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the matter has been referred to the provincial manager in the Western Cape for a speedy resolution. “Officials will be delegated to contact the client.”
