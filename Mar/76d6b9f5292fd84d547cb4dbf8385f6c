Chairman of the Umlazi Business Forum, Mandla Mhlongo told Daily Sun their staff contracted by the municipality to remove refuse in various parts of the kasi have not been paid since December.He said they decided to take to the streets to vent their anger and send a strong message to the municipality.“This is the fourth month. There are a few who have received some form of payment for December and January. The cause of that inconsistency should also be explained to us.” Mhlongo said municipal officials in charge of the Durban Solid Waste section had refused to set up an appointment, saying they were busy.“After this blockade, we are going to give them some time to get back to us. If they fail, we are going to shut down the kasi completely,” said Mhlongo.Delangokubona secretary Sifiso Myeza said they were very unhappy with the municipality.A commuter Siyabonga Vezi (34) said it was sad that many people had to be late for work because of something that could’ve been discussed and resolved.Spokesman for the eThekwini mayor, Mthunzi Gumede, said: “A task team has been urgently formed to deal with the matter.”
