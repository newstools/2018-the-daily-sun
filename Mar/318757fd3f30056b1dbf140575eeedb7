It is part of giving back to my community,” she said. “It’s a way to show you must not forget where you come from or turn a blind eye to the fact that there are others out there who need help.”According to Chauke, who is the sports organiser tasked with co-ordinating netball, volleyball and basketball at TUT’s Tshwane campus, former Netball South Africa president Ntambi Ravele is expected to attend. Chauke, who will be travelling with the senior netball Proteas team to the Commonwealth Games as an intern coach in April, expects 150-200 young netballers and their coaches at the knockout tournament.Like this story?
