WHEN gogo Molobane Matlakala (73) tried to withdraw her grant money at the shops, she almost fainted. And it wasn’t because of the heat or the long queues.

After finally sorting out her grant nightmare, she wasn’t paid the outstanding grant money after several enquiries at Sassa. So this time around, the gogo from Mankweng in Limpopo said she is not buying any stories from Sassa. She pleaded with Sassa to come to her aid. She needs the money to buy food and for medical check-ups. She told Daily Sun she learnt on 1 February that her grant money hadn’t been paid into her card. She has since visited the Mankweng Sassa offices several times but was sent from pillar to post. “The day I didn’t get the money I went to the offices,” she said.  “Officials checked on their system and then sent me to the shops where I normally withdraw my pay, but my grant money wasn’t deposited.  “I went back. They checked again and told me to go to their pay point, but still there was no money. “I buy my groceries the day after I get paid my grant.  I don’t how I’m expected to survive this month.  “I don’t have food left. I’m living with my unemployed son. “I have lost confidence in Sassa. It’s not the first time that this is happening to me.” Sassa’s Limpopo spokesman Zwanda Kutama said they had checked gogo Molobane’s problem on their system and found that her ID number was invalid.  “It could be that she’s sharing her ID with someone else,” she told Daily Sun. “We encourage her to go to her nearest Home Affairs office to check with them.”
