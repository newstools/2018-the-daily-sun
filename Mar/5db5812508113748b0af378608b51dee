Moseneke gave the South African government three months to compensate the families. The compensation is in excess of R1m for each claimant.He slammed government - particularly former Gauteng health MEC Qedani Mahlangu, former Gauteng health department head Dr Barney Selebano and former Gauteng director of mental health Dr Makgabo Manamela - for the manner in which they handled the Gauteng mental health marathon project.Moseneke also said that he would hand over his report to the police for criminal investigations. During his testimony at the arbitration hearings in January, Makhura said that he was assured by Mahlangu and Selebano that the department had the capacity to house patients at state facilities.Makhura added that, knowing what he knows now, he would have intervened.'I don't find his ignorance credible'Bloom, however, said Makhura should have intervened earlier and fired Mahlangu when she disclosed that 32 patients had died. "The premier claims he didn’t know they were going to NGOs. He said, had he known they were going to NGO’s he would have never approved it, but there were media reports, two court cases on the matter and he was there when I asked Mahlangu about the patients. We are focusing on his supposed ignorance. I don’t find his ignorance credible," he said. Police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo told News24 that they had completed 45 dockets, which had been handed over to NPA."The National Director of Public Prosecutions now has to decide if there is reasonable cause to proceed with criminal investigations," Naidoo said. Makhura is facing the second motion of no confidence against him over the tragedy. Last year, the EFF tabled a motion, supported by the DA, over his involvement in the Life Esidimeni deaths.SOURCE: NEWS24
