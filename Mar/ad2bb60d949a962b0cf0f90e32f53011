A BANGLADESHI airliner with 71 people on board crashed today
while coming in to land at the airport in the Nepali capital, Kathmandu,
killing at least 50 people, officials said.The plane, operated by US-Bangla Airlines, was on a
flight from Dhaka when it hit an airport fence and burst into flames, said Raj
Kumar Chettri, general manager of the hill-ringed airport, which is prone to
bird strikes and other hazards.“We have recovered 50 dead bodies so far,” said army
spokesman Gokul Bhandari. Several people had been rescued from the burning
wreckage of the Bombardier Q400 series aircraft but nine people were still
unaccounted for, he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvt-AG0xTcxzx48YlTemwIlPPq6dDorkdQveXR1SlOemcbFL3qsP4pgbpoUBE2JGM1hCU-oKeSePkEIOOnMyR1K3QVJ7vvoINKjZjGfOWWnEmkrboeCBbHJCeU0fx-0CjB3PnIcvC2u8ud64WUXAWE-yxO0IKnDWcXn7ydohRS9hE0MVEzt9uENuyOTDFWCEah0oKI62pTmTKIgJKCZyzrPdZ8xA3EaiesT5Y4k5ecDu-wU1PSSOCZVeyoR11NFbnZCOphZVD8p5nmCGR6F8GNCps8WdsA1ypTiqw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzN218f4_kg5MEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

field near the tarmac of Tribhuvan International Airport.Many of the bodies that lay on the tarmac covered by
cloth were charred, witnesses said. Thick plumes of smoke could be seen from
the aircraft.Later, photographs showed the fire had been put out, with
army personnel and rescue workers at the scene.Mountainous Nepal has had a poor air safety record. Small
aircraft ply an extensive domestic network and often run into trouble at remote
airstrips.A Thai Airways flight from Bangkok crashed while trying
to land in Kathmandu in 1992 killing all on board.
