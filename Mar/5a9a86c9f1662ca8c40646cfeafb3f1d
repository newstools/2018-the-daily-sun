THERE are some study habits that are valuable life skills.Dr Gillian Mooney, dean for academic development and support at The Independent Institute of Education, said: “When pupils study it is not only what they study that’s important but HOW they study is important too.”Mooney said there are a few basics that pupils and students can start putting in place as part of their regular routines, which will clear the administrative clutter on their desks and in their minds including:if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Learn to touch typeYour productivity is vastly improved when you don’t have to stare at the keyboard and press one finger down at a time.“Taking notes is more accurate, assignments can be completed faster, and admin can be handled more effectively through touch-typing.“Being a keyboard expert is a skill everyone needs.”Good organisational habits“Too many first year studies struggle to juggle all their requirements and work assignments.”Mooney said pupils should start getting into the habit of filing their notes every day as well as spending a few minutes every day on administration and organisation.Learn to multi-taskUsing your time effectively and creatively can cut a lot of waste from your day which comes in handy when pressure really sets in.“For instance, when going for a run, don’t just listen to music. You can use this time to listen to an audio book or a discussion on the subject you are studying or revising at the moment. Find opportunities such as these, where you can do two tasks instead of one.”A commitment to learningSome pupils and students can’t wait for the end of school, exams or university.But always looking forward to when your studies are finally finished makes every test and exam for every subject a labour or chore that has to be done. Rather, embrace each subject as an enjoyable and fun investigation instead of something boring.
