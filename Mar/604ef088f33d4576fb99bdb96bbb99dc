He was born feet first and not head first. “He had weak muscles and I had to open the nipple of his bottle to feed him without his muscles straining,” she said. She said doctors told her Jabulane would be able to walk after three years. It never happened. “He has a weak spinal cord and can’t stand on his own.” she said.“He couldn’t use his hands until he was six.” Jabulane is a member of the Vezabantu support group, where he helps other people with the same condition. He is currently at the Avril Elizabeth Home and helps assemble battery terminals and paints books for kids.
