She cried when she was shown the third one.“My first thought was how I would take care of so many kids,” said the mother of seven.“Their father is unemployed. He wakes up every morning to go and look for work but he hasn’t found a job,” she said.While he’s out looking for jobs, Cyngrid is left with seven babies to care for, with the triplets taking up all her attention.“I love them. They are strong and beautiful but I’m not coping. They eat a lot and I can’t afford to take care of them,” she said.“They cry at the same time. I only relax when they are asleep. When they wake up, I work like a slave,” she said.The triplets are called Abby, Gabby and Tabby.“They were given these names by a nurse at the hospital. I kept the names because I love them. But three is too much. I’m not coping. I need help,” she said.
