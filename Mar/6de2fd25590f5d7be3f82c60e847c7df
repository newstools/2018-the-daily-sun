He was speaking at the funeral service of Captain Dumisani Mhlanzi in Umsinga in the KZN Midlands on Sunday.The cop was shot and killed during a robbery in KwaMaphumulo,Cele’s spokesman Nonkululelo Mbatha-Phokane said the minister had met national police commissioner General Khehla Sitole to discuss the case.“The investigation with regards to Meyiwa’s death continues, but that is not enough,” Mbatha-Phokane told the People’s Paper. “Cele wants to see action. He wants the police to leave no stone unturned.”She said Cele had met former police minister Fikile Mbalula, Sitole and other police officials yesterday to discuss various cases, including Senzo’s.“Since 2014, police have been saying they’re investigating but no action has been taken. Cele wants to see people being arrested. She said people who commit crime must not go free. “Senzo’s family and fans want to see justice being done. That’s what’s going to happen.” Senzo’s father Sam has said he believes in Cele.“As I mentioned before to Daily Sun, I was happy when Cele was reappointed,” he said. “Tables will turn. “There will be no place to hide for the killer.”
