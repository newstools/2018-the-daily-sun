He can attempt movements that we fear trying, such as neck hanging, jumping and standing on the bar,” said Dikonketso.Siyamukela is the master of combo. “I can muscle up and rotate 360 degrees,” he said.Dikonketso said calisthenics built core strength. “It targets the overall movement and mobility of the body.”The trio recently competed at the national calisthenics championships that were also a World Cup qualifier competition.They took second and third positions in the combo and static competitions.
