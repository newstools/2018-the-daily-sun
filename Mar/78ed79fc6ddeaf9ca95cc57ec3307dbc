I am so angry! Young ManDear Young ManYour anger and confusion are understandable. But this is the perfect opportunity to have a serious talk with your mum. Do this in a respectful manner that will allow her to give you her side of the story. She’s still a parent and parents are on a constant mission to become better people for their kids’ sake.
