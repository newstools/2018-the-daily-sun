In most cases they shot at the victims many times. “Three of their victims, aged between 23 and 67, were shot and killed. Five were shot but survived. One of the victims was shot 16 times and died at the scene,” she said. Mashale said the accused terrorised the community of Muldersdrift until one of the victims spotted them in Diepsloot.Manana and Constable Mncedisi Bambiso of Muldersdrift police responded swiftly and arrested the first suspect.Victims expressed their satisfaction and praised the cops for doing a great job.A relative of one of the victims, Simon Louw, said the men deserved their sentences. “We don’t need such people in our society. I’m happy they have been permanently removed from society.”He said he still remembers the day when the suspects broke into their house while they were having dinner. “It took my partner nearly a year to recover after being shot in the stomach,” he said.
