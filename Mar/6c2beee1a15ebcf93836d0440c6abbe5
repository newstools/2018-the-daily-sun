I have confidence in her, as she has won races, broken records before and placed us on the world map. "Her past achievements put her ahead of anyone else, and I am confident she will indeed achieve her objective.”Xasa has further urged South Africans to rally behind her and “grant her the necessary support she requires”.She added: “ We must always remember that sport plays a tremendous role in fostering social cohesion and nation building, hence we all must unite behind Caster.I know we are competing against the Ugandan athletes and they intend to be party spoilers, however we have confidence in Caster with home ground advantage.”Meanwhile, Xasa has further lamented on the incident of the mutilation of Mhlengi Gwala’s leg that occurred in Umbilo, in Durban this week.  This inhumane treatment of a budding athlete, has not only caused pain to the athlete, but also threatens to jeopardize his international career, a statement from her department said. She said she deeply regrets this incident and condemned “this sheer thuggery”.Xasa  reminded South Africans to place additional vigilance when exercising on the roads, especially when running or walking alone. She further wished Gwala a speedy recovery, following the operation he underwent on Wednesday, and she is looking forward to seeing Mhlengi on the training track soon.  Like this story?
