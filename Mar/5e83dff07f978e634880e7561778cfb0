Molamodi then went back to his mother’s house and only visited when their six-year-old son was sick.Molamodi’s mum, Rachel Maenetja said she was torn apart by the way her family was disrespected.“They were not even married. My son only sent us to Maria’s family when she gave birth to ask for her hand in marriage. We paid R4 000 towards her lobola but we never went back to pay the rest. My son changed his mind after they had moved in together in 2014 and stopped us from carrying on with the lobola negotiations. “It doesn’t qualify as a customary marriage.”Maria said she got the court order because the Maenetja family wanted to sideline her.“They came to my family in 2012 and paid towards lobola. That’s a customary marriage. That man and I lived like husband and wife at our house. I want to mourn for him too. Even on the day of his death we slept at our house. He was living here with us,” she said. Maria wants Molamodi’s body to arrive at their house a day before the funeral and go to his mother’s house before the burial, but the Maenetja family is refusing.Both families will appear at the Limpopo High Court on Tuesday.
