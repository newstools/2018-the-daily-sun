Last week, another woman was arrested for selling dagga to pupils in Tshepisong.” Sibiya said the next time cops visited the school, pupils would be searched.“The more tip-offs we get the better, because we will be able to catch the people who break the law and ruin these kids’ futures.” Captain Sibiya said the issue of giving kids a lot of lunch money should be addressed. “This woman sold a pack of dagga for R10, a full pill of mandrax for R40 and half a pill for R20,” he said. “This could only mean that each of the kids contributed a certain amount to get their fix. This also leads to kids stealing money at home and from their classmates to buy drugs.”
