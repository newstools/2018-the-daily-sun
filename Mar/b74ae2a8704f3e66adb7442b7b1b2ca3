THE family of Sindi Ceko is fuming because her boyfriend, who is accused of killing her, was released on bail on Tuesday. The 25-year-old’s corpse was found at her boyfriend Dennis Madukane’s house last Monday. Her sister Khethiwe said she never dreamt that Sindi’s four-year relationship with Madukane (30) would end in tragedy. Khethiwe claimed the family believed Sindi died at about 10pm while she was visiting Madukane. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss-XmCH9hrnaUI7SILvXIbKbr5RtqirEgiB1N_OkAdP_R2CtAwCezK2cIuCKxaax7McrSZtm__kRg7Pl4DynlXrhctcRsQYlEU_TEaHYzRhjiRQ3ks3_Vcq2kwqf2aYXuP29GIh8JoLdIz4ETAHqnlMhi_cPSlF9z4VNk7JGnT57oBqb4EHwGAdQoQctf35yAzKfLXQ0Oux1-c53dAvgV6WTloSl9fuC8mZziXK_YR5Xj4FDbEaT341VoqtzBQPJOBWq8Nhjk6ftSpz7NtwaOrjmPyrXrs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCkpRhJ-AdWEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

When the security guards arrived she was already dead.“It’s not easy for us to know the perpetrator is walking freely.” Police spokesman Sergeant David Ratau said the accused handed himself over after disappearing from the scene of the crime on the night of the murder. He said Madukane was facing a murder charge and was released on R2 000 bail. He is due to appear in the Witbank Magistrates Court on 4 May.
