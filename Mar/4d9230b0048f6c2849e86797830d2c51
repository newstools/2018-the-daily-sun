DA shadow police minister Zakhele Mbhele said gay people were full and equal members of society. “It’s not enough for rights to only exist in the Constitution, laws or policies if they are not enforced and upheld by strong and capable institutions,” he said. “We must be able to trust there will be effective investigations and those responsible for homophobic attacks are found and face justice.”
