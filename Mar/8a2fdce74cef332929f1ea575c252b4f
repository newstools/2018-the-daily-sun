The pair reportedly exchanged strong words in Spanish.It was reported that McCarthy barged at Costas with his shoulder before the two became involved in a scuffle as players and staff tried to defuse the situation.It is said McCarthy allegedly then raised his hand and slapped Costa do Sol’s technical director Arturo Faria, although this was not witnessed by match officials.City’s media officer Julian Bailey confirmed to Sport24 on Monday that there was an altercation in the tunnel between the two teams, but said “no slaps or smacks” were exchanged as security defused the situation. It’s been a controversial debut season for McCarthy as professional head coach. During his first iKapa derby in the league, the 40-year-old was involved in a touchline dispute with Ajax Cape defender Isaac Nhlapo and was caught on camera using foul language.For the away fixture of the derby clash, McCarthy stole the headlines as he and Ajax mentor Muhsin Ertugral clashed in the technical area, which resulted in the former striker being sent to the stands by the referee.McCarthy has also been vocal in his opinions, which has landed him in hot water. The coach was recently fined R50 000 by the Premier Soccer League for branding referee Phillip Tinyani a ‘cow’ after last October’s 2-1 loss to Chippa United.City’s next match is against Golden Arrows at Cape Town Stadium on Wednesday 4 April. – SPORT24
