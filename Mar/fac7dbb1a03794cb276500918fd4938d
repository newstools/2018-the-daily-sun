The 88th Geneva International Motoring Show is in full swing
and the unveils are coming in left and right. Mercedes-AMG has joined the fray
unveiling their latest family member, the AMG GT 4-Door Coupe.Â  From the front, the four-door coupe is clearly a GT car. It
features the long GT bonnet with those distinct two lines on top. Under that
bonnet, you find three different engines. There's the entry-level AMG GT 53
with an inline 6-cylinder engine with an output of 320-kW and 520-Nm of torque.
The AMG GT 53 is good for 0-100-km/h in 4.5 seconds. It will top out at
285-km/h.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The wonderful 4.0-litre AMG is available in 2 variants. In
the AMG GT 63, the V8 produces 430-kW and 800-Nm. It will rocket down the
straight to 100-km/h in 3.4 seconds and top out at 311-km/hThe top of the range AMG GT 63s' V8 produces a whopping
470-kW and 900-Nm of torque. 0-100-km/h is dealt with in just 3.2 seconds and
it will go all the way to 315-km/h.Power is sent to all four wheels using either the 9-speed
automatic transmission.In the entry-level car, you find a torque
converter 9-Speed set up. Whilst in the V8 versions there's a 9-speed with a
wet-clutch and launch control.Inside the AMG GT 4-door coupe features Mercedes' dual
12-inch screen set up, which is a shame. The 2-door AMG GT's interior is
arguably the best-looking interior in a car right now. The interior in this
4-door GT ditches the drama for the elegance of the S-Class-like interior.Obviously inside you also get two extra seats. These are
proper seats, with proper leg room. This is the AMG GT for the guy who wants
the thrilling driving experience of the GT line with added practicality. So
there's also a boot with 395-litres capacity which can be further increased to
1324- litres by folding the seats.
