BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic heaped more misery on Platinum Stars with a 1-0 win at the Dr Molemela Stadium on Sunday afternoon in an Absa Premiership encounter. Dikwena started well with some swift passing to peg Celtic back early on. Gerald Phiri failed to test Patrick Tignyemb though as Lucky Baloyi's 12th minute effort flew well over the target at the other end. Celtic though were the more decisive of the two on the break and Deon Hotto had a good chance to catch out Mbongeni Mzimela, but his tame effort failed to trouble the Stars stopper.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv-2ovo3qidAxsQmq3vyrCQhNL4jqhf1kkZzSGhUgj8Lgvy0n-L2W2XhontPfAylWwLi4VNxiKakxWDTMtCxXyKYi6XrbW5V2PgaXBYs-KvZR0q1xL4O2u4_TbQfEHHN3hOlONU81S_kxvgPuGCTRD-fJ_fXT2svu5x7BIWj6hPh9ZiSXF8CScwzpUGSSLti97bIiMs5Ld-am5GTUy_ohT2DzBwkiksO17afIoaS317XMn-hiB5-kBut1H-7LLC7jkzGwcFZUjxfURcMp_Gi9S64Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIc-iWPisvBzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
