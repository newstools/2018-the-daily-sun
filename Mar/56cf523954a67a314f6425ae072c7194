carry the costs of Zuma's defence, as they have already done for the past 9
years,” he said.Maimane also said that Zuma’s case and the case of Schabir
Shaik, which proceeded n 2009, should not have been separated.“When Shabir Shaik was found guilty on charges of corruption
and fraud in relation to the Arms Deal on 7 April 2005, Judge Squires' judgment
made it clear that Zuma must also be charged, and that the evidence for this
was “convincing and really overwhelming”,” he said.In a statement, the EFF said that no one is above the law.“The principle of equality before the law means we must all
be equally held accountable for the deeds deemed illegal regardless of our
social and political standing.“ The prosecution of Zuma will send a strong message to all
kleptomaniacs within and outside the government that they can never loot the
state and not meet the consequences thereof,” the statement read.
