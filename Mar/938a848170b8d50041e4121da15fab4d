We had been told to do so by the municipality. But on our arrival, we were told we were quite a big number and therefore could not be assisted. We then got upset and demanded answers because we’re tired of the delays,” he said. According to Sifiso, Ekukhanyeni has existed since 2010 and has over 1 000 shack dwellers now. “All we want is recognition because we’re also residents of Mzansi. Why aren’t we given basic services like everyone else?We don’t understand what exactly is causing the delays because no one is explaining anything“But since then no progress has been made. We are still using candles and paraffin stovesSome of us rely on illegal electricity connections. Our lives are in danger and we want to live a normal life,” said Sifiso.Secretary of the shack dwellers movement Abahlali baseMjondolo, Thapelo Mohapi, said: “There are negotiations going on between our members and the municipality. We’re just hopeful the outcome will be positive.”Municipal spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa confirmed the protest, which she described as peaceful., outside the Sizakala offices in Pinetown.“Residents asked for electricity to be connected in their informal settlement.Sizakala centre officials engaged with them and listed their grievances. However, we are unable to assist them as the informal settlement has been built on private land and the matter is in court,” she said. Tozi added that until the court issue was resolved, the municipality would be unable to provide services.
