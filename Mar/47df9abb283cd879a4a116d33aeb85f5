BLIND Ngwanakopi Ratshwene and her neighbours are worried.  The 47-year-old from Hospital View in Seshego, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, told Daily Sun a heavy storm on Tuesday night left RDPs in the area flooded. She and her husband, who’s also blind, became aware of the flooding when she started getting wet while sitting in their dining room. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv5jDg7OU5tDQsmCmdAQ9dHY3KCuUfrpfUiUIvIVNOs83lXQ8QTSo425SEMkG2Vsc1zbNL3pwUjQpCirjfPcKaOAL8FhcW8pBcLQaGYYmfsbnZ-iDQm2nXzxYjMiRLqklq4DBLeUlSoMCmgw_M5SNDyD-1D4U3VBJNSC-OqDt9dPlXHp-S9MX81oME6fejXK2fOPR-Nz68coqXG8YIP0LcbcPmrEok9zA-0LklytbV0IsVUtevhMwUmYQ1D1acPNo-DPEn1AU2vQ6tHUjGExzmZ4BIoTlQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzARE8Rv6vSydEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I called out to members of my family, who assisted me to clear out the mud from my house.“I’m also relieved that my neighbours and the councillor came to check that we were safe.” Meanwhile, kasi residents accused the municipality of building houses in an unsafe place. Collins Molamodi said there was a pool of water and mud in his house.“There are two drainage systems near Seshego Hospital that aren’t working,” he said. “Lots of water comes out of both of them and flows into our houses. This puts us in danger. We’re desperate for accommodation because our beds and food get wet.” Municipal spokesman Tshidiso Mothapo said a report was received and would be forwarded to the roads and storm water section.He said the community’s allegations would be investigated.“The community is advised to bring the matter to the attention of ward committee members in the area and to the ward councillor so the relevant department can follow up,” he said.
