She said her doctor said she shouldn’t fly and could only go to Cape Town by road. Chairwoman Zukiswa Rantho said she had asked Myeni to put her apology in writing and attach the doctor’s certificate. The committee resolved to give Myeni until Wednesday. She must submit a doctor’s certificate. DA MP Natasha Mazzone asked former Eskom board chair Ben Ngubane why he was obsessed with keeping former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe in his position, and to make sure there was a pension scheme for him. Ngubane said Molefe brought joy to the people because of his intervention in load shedding.He said there wasn’t anyone else who could have turned Eskom around in such a short time. “I was excited!” Ngubane said.
