JURGEN Klopp said he was satisfied with the manner of Liverpool’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle United and afterwards reflected on the key moments that enabled it. The Reds recorded a fourth successive win in all competitions, and moved up to second in the Premier League ahead of their trip to Manchester United next weekend, with a controlled performance at Anfield. Goals on either side of half-time from Mohamed Salah – his 32nd of the season – and Sadio Mane were enough to see off the challenge of Rafael Benitez’s visitors. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>At his post-match press conference, Klopp discussed the performance of his team, a crucial stop by Loris Karius at 1-0, Salah’s scoring exploits and much more. He said: “So Newcastle would have said ‘perfect moment’, but for us it would have been exactly the opposite. It is exactly the life of a top-class goalkeeper. If you are in a top team, you don’t have a lot to do but when you have something to do, you need to be there – and he was there, so it’s a good thing. It’s better that they had the finish and he could make the save, rather than if they couldn’t have shot the ball at the goal, because then nobody speaks about the goalkeeper. So it’s good.  “It was fantastic – it was like scoring, to be honest. We scored two more and that made the result. I’m happy about the result, it was a good result, but it’s already over.” Next up are Porto FC in the Champons League at Anfield tomorrow.
