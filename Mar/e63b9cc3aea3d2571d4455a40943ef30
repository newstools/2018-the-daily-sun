The pupils were taken for medical check-ups and later discharged from hospital,” he said. “They were never admitted, but just treated as outpatients. Our school policy states very clearly that school is a place for teaching and learning, not for business.“We also involved the police to investigate the dagga being brought into our school in muffins. We want to know where the dagga came from,” Makondo said.
