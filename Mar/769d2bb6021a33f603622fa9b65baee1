Happiness’ body was later found by rescue team members floating in the water.The tragic incident happened on the banks of Molepo Dam near Polokwane in Limpopo, where fellow ANC members were attending a party meeting and celebrating Capricorn mayor John Mpe’s birthday party.Witnesses told the People’s Paper that drunk Happiness had to be pulled out twice earlier in the day when he insisted that he could swim.“How could such a drunk person try to swim in such a huge dam?” said a concerned man who was at the party. “The guys saved him twice.“But he wouldn’t listen and went in for the third time – and that was the last time.”Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe told Daily Sun: “Members of the police search and rescue team were summoned and managed to retrieve the body.”Ngoepe said an inquest docket was opened by the cops.
