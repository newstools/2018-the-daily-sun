I’m going back to music. There’s no theory behind it.” Her debut album, New Era Sessions, which featured Moozlie, Big Star and singer KLY, was released last year. It set the tone for what she had in store for her fans.Speaking to SunBuzz, Rouge said the album emphasised some of the struggles women face in the industry.“The industry can be very sexist, with ideas of what I should rap about and how I should look.“I was limited in my bookings because they didn’t want too many women in the line-up. But I knew this would be the case so I persevered. “You can’t keep a focused woman down.” The star said she grew up listening to soul and R&B music and was inspired by Stevie Wonder, Lauryn Hill and Kanye West.She said she currently draws inspiration from international artists such as SZA and Logic.The Party hit-maker is preparing to shake things up at the upcoming Red Bull Music Festival in Joburg, which lasts from 3 to 8 April. The show will boast over 80 artists at the six-day music explosion.“I’m beyond excited. I mean 80 artists in one city? “That’s crazy and that’s what I call pushing boundaries.“I can’t wait to jump on stage and meet some of my fans and make new ones. “I’m performing on 6 April at Great Dane in Braamfontein alongside Moozlie, Uncle Partytime, Gina Jeanz and other amazing artists.” The festival will take place at various venues including Kitchener’s in Braamfontein, And Club in Newtown, Fox Junction in the CBD and Zone 6 Venue in Soweto.
