southern Nigeria after a man married his sister, claiming that God had told him
to do so.According to Punch,
Chiadikobi Ezeibekwe is a maths teacher at a secondary school in the village of
Agba. Last Sunday, he and his 17-year-old sister were married in the local
Dwelling Fullness of God church. The wedding was conducted by Ezeibekwe’s older brother, Chijioke
Ezeibekwe, a priest at this church.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvVtfZacSz2kFidPyKpMTMrgzaXMcPlR3PCJhN8rQCLBAb_qFvkejfS6hkV8m30SSt_bXjvTQ1TrngkiT6B2Qqmjtx2T9yWI31wZWzgOd_usNmOPAJ4mUcVO15tJSK5m0yBQmqPgwmv2SBwuo8w-vzkJDoaIZWtDfWVLSCCb4R4TrURmDKsRGzQEelFesrIh5qC1zXJviz_9hBV2J_lgSc77YtmkKfq4YCqlwd-BGnK8YPneEO5SsLMCo2tsgT2ULoLX3VLq_zQfKOLwi1VH1nCdrxw29eS0GvTHA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA8CkjMt4qivEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

that he had a revelation where God told him to marry his sister. He also quoted
Biblical passages that say siblings can marry each other.Ezeibekwe is quoted as saying: “One advantage of doing
this is that it discourages divorce. It also retains family values and norms.“I don’t feel guilty. I don’t feel ashamed. I don’t feel
intimidated in any way. Only God can stop us.”He added that he did not pay anyone lobola for his sister’s
hand in marriage.But many in their family and community are furious, and
youth’s vented their anger the day after the wedding by torching the Dwelling
Fullness of God church.The traditional prime minister of Ekwulobia, Gabriel
Ezeukwu is quoted as saying: “Agba village youths, who saw the marriage as an
abomination,  set ablaze the church where
the wedding took place.“I restrained them from further action against the man
and his family.  If it were in the past,
the entire family would be burnt down because this is a grave abomination and
sin.”The eldest son of the Ezeibekwe family, Emeka, is also
livid.“It’s over my dead body that they will call themselves husband
and wife. It can’t happen,” he said.
