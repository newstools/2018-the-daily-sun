They are still not okay, and that is why we asked the PSL to postpone this match. But our request was refused, we had to come and play. You could see that it was not the normal Maritzburg tonight. We absorbed the pressure – SuperSport could have won. But my team did their best, I am happy with a point under the circumstances.He added: “Ntshangase is still in ICU and we’re pleading with the country to pray for him. His situation is still not good but we wish him a speedy recovery.” The draw against struggling SuperSport has left Davids’ on-form side fourth in the table with 35 points from 23 games. They are eight points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns with seven games left.Davids said their goal was to seal a top eight spot first before they start thinking of the championship. “We need to reach the 40-point mark as soon as possible, and then I will say we are in top eight,” said Davids. “But for now we are not yet safe. This league is full of surprises. You can lose two games and you’re out of top eight. I think 40 points will see us safely in the top eight. That is why I am saying we cannot talk about championship while we are not yet securely in the top eight.” Davids said he was happy with the performance of his young team this season.
