Police did their job effectively because Cele was a man of his word. He intimidated criminals and they retreated, and no one dared to kill the lawmen,” he said.The lyrics of the song go: “Our country is in a mess. Police are shot, children and gogos are raped, what happened? Government collects unlicensed guns. . . We say Bheki Cele must come back to deal with this situation. Come back, Ndosi.”Jezekhulu said they wished Cele would again use his old successful way to deal with criminals. “He had a tough way to intimidate criminals. He is never scared of anyone.“He gives his police good instructions to protect us as residents. “As residents we do not feel safe when we hear that the police are being killed like flies,” he said. Social networks were also abuzz with the news of Cele’s return, with people complimenting Ramaphosa on his smart move.
