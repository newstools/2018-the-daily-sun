woman didn't arrive for her court appearance on Thursday.It is was reported that over 20 women were forced to undress
and they were then physically inspected at gambling franchise Topbet’s Germiston
branch in January.Following the discovery of the menstrual blood, the
management questioned all the female employees and accused them of leaving
menstrual blood in the communal staff toilet.A 52-year-old woman who works for the company alleges that
she pleaded with her manager to be excused as she's already been through
menopause.
