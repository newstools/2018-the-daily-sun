THESE gatvol residents say they’re being terrorised by mosquitoes. The people of Lower Crossroads in Philippi East, Cape Town, told Daily Sun they had sleepless nights and it was especially bad for those living next to the canal. Sandla Mashiya (45) said he was forced to go to sleep wearing a long-sleeved T-shirt, socks, gloves and a balaclava. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssVcjJSvr4UmFYbRfqRET9aGqlXqSGiSieIs8vRf1tYAg6FSHMi2JyA6MLT5nTT-ilMDqmFT0_q9_dZ1I8n2m-VWmiDES-mQ-6uHf7ff5C7knljMGEdT5mbNvV8V7bvXDBjg74hVu6ULE437X07rJ4xwOm4cs3q3B4Y5xMeC5hcuP9YqXfLt6r_ZMpOrEl00_Man0KZ4D8XT3sQTGPYPj44ZAUISkw4Fd9ni7x1o_h0C3T34FSj7tWMNeG6dwyPg3O0jpWMOIW6_5OxEpd6ew0zdxNI4Es\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzK-QAecemjybEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The city must help us,” he said. Luzuko Fihlani (38) said he had tried everything to kill them. “Peaceful Sleep costs more than R40 and most of us aren’t working,” he said. He said the municipality helped residents deal with cockroaches and he hoped they would do the same with the mosquito problem.“If the city could clean this canal like they did to others in Gugulethu we won’t have this problem any more,” he said. Zoliswa Ntentema (39) said the smell from the canal was also unbearable. “There is a lot of kak in there and it comes into our houses. We need the city to clean it.” A local shopkeeper said he was making a lot of money by selling Doom. “We have been stocking more of it as it’s in high demand.” Central MMC Siyabulela Mamkeli said officials had inspected the site. “Vegetation on the embankment will be cut down and weed spraying will be done before mechanical cleaning starts. “The canal is littered with rubbish and illegally dumped rubble.”Mamkeli encouraged residents to report illegal dumping to 086 010 3089.
