That is the bold statement made by their head coach Steve Komphela as Amakhosi seem to be slowing running out of steam in the Absa Premiership title race.But Komphela refuses to throw in the towel. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsstehUNZsWwP9F_mMHnGEjCdLPWU1xMp24Wc8qGQ4bi-J9b4G5tTqZEEqx1V-87fKICTb3Mkpj6buhGpsEuw3JgsNxdZLlJC7a2ibHB4CXdoqdvvH-uDTNOBaF6li47u5JyZAG8xQYLXKMvEvtO67-9I4uuXmYX20x7OywjruHFi1aAi05Qw9B4bvzZt_b5vbV7w3dE7cplg2XfnwISPeu5rHXDktuCkoCoWIZWSp4JOD10seqsO6Uw4im6FmVvAqKin6hPHrc7sz400B0707bMyA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHAauuW66jugEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Amakhosi trail pacesetters Mamelodi Sundowns by eight points in fifth position, but Komphela insists anything can happen. Leonardo Castro scored for Amakhosi in the first half of their Soweto derby against Orlando Pirates but Thembinkosi Lorch and a brace by Luvoyo Memela were enough to shatter Chiefs’ dreams. But fans enjoyed the goals – and having a winner after many draws.Amakhosi dramatically collapsed in the second half as Bucs dominated Saturday’s game, with substitute Memela scoring a brace to help them to their comprehensive 3-1 victory. Komphela was evasive when asked if he was worried about his future. With SuperSport United coach Eric Tinkler having resigned on Friday and Chippa United coach Tebogo Moloi let go on Saturday, Komphela was diplomatic in his response. “I can’t answer that question because it will be dragged in anyhow,” Komphela said. “We go through much stress and pain as coaches. I won’t respond to the question but I have my own way of thinking on the matter.” But when it comes to dethroning Sundowns at the top, Komphela insists there is always an outside chance. “Seven times three is 21. Mathematically we are still in it. We have a huge professional responsibility to keep pushing. You never know what will happen in upcoming matches. We feel bad that we lost but have an obligation to keep on performing and hoping for the best. Giving up is not in our DNA, that is not the Chiefs way.” The Carling Black Label #NoExcuse campaign, which raises awareness about women abuse, took centre stage in front of the 93 000-plus fans at the stadium.Before kick-off, a group of brave and inspiring women, the #NoExcuse choir, performed a beautiful rendition of the popular Mas’hambe Nono song. In true Mzansi style, the well-known song had readapted lyrics that aimed to bring awareness to the reality many women face on a daily basis, abuse by a partner.Like this story?
