MZANSI’S poster boy Wayde “Dreamer” van Niekerk, who is recovering from a knee injury, says he’ll come back stronger than before to break records and complete a clean sweep in world athletics.The world champion in the 400m said it felt strange to watch the Telecom Athletix Grand Prix Series on the sidelines.But he was also quick to admit that if there was a year for him to be injured, it had to be this one as it is not a World Championships or Olympics year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu3adGphogZjk7HYeLVIaNEVyc2XSotIE9h3pHUsq-JKD16Pyif94oAbC5hI9xKcECklSTtbK4azsCPxsaXGD5fM2Xpp3WuxFmYxbkEaccQBPtWaV1LUWHUaS7f-ed5PDrtoQLU0sCqr3_pSLafQqica1PDrkv9e1vIm86q9iENmchRgKqoUyt5tCo8G4S_JLoPZhexhnEuspYf3uuMEayMjQmLDNGgRvEVC7LeEkB46ndG-ZFCm_gmDc6a-QYCYcYEIyhuZ7TClLNFyLqT\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAnefHPjzZEpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I can guarantee you that I’ll come back stronger than before. I’m looking forward to shatteringrecords. I’m in a positive phase of the rehab and looking forward to the process of recovering and improving myself for the upcoming season.”Van Niekerk gave the Grand Prix concept a big thumbs up with stars such as SA golden girl Caster Semenya, Akani Simbine, Isaac Makwala of Bostwana, Amantle Montsho of Bostwana, Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda competing on South African soil, and not in Europe.Van Niekerk said: “It speaks volume for the quality of track and field we have in SA with big names stars coming here to test our facilities.” Van Niekerk described his injury as a blessing in disguise as he gears up for the world champs in Doha, Qatar in 2019 and the Olympic Games in Japan 2020. At the Olympic Games he will be hoping to follow in American 400m icon Michael Johnson’s footsteps and defend his Olympic title. In Doha he is aiming to win a triple 400m world title a rare feat. Van Niekerk added: “It’s a great year to rebuild and to refresh myself. I’m only missing out on the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia next month it’s not a train smash.”
