KAIZER Chiefs progressed to the Nedbank Cup quarter-finals after beating Stellenbosch 2-1 thanks to goals from Erick Mathoho and Leonardo Castro. Amakhosi looked to patiently build up from the back in the opening ten minutes, while the visitors were not allowing them time and space on the ball in the last third. Steve Barker’s troops looked organised at the back and it was going to take something special or a mistake to break their defensive rearguard. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssXsfERrq9rBNUO6xJvXxaNqWFnsNWbflIZpj99yQdTwZTUpfdLkZcFKJzvnPuTrcrKdkGzh1biY_RV9fXx-9qAGBPoI65JDJMS_EMvPowaEqcGQV16T1PJb1cemnSyRZ-wczftVkUJITPUJnPTiXzm0noHRyk7m1EOf5i0sdpD2WWdzRyc8FUIE_pCgt9-6weRveapQqk2O9Y5P5MmdVFzIGVc1E0OqWqS4xzQt9szFaFPgUypnUWAdq_YelX_Zc-GJ7Q9dWtoNH7_7L3V\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMj2UDXwUY81EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
