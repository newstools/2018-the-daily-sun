Kagiso Lediga told Daily Sun being a storyteller first and then a comedian is why he’s been in the public eye for over 10 years.“Comedy is cheaper than movies. That’s what I used to say when I didn’t make movies. It was a bit of a crutch.” His special way of telling stories has seen him move from being just a stand-up comedian to become a television host, filmmaker, producer and director.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssHTHoCt1EOrWVtiX8TUirlvpUbPFLa8iQBdPTHkb6FdMzRaYeIsqwJxShn_cbEY6XAfew8FF5BzUZjToHLXRmRY43hA0yiTebKCHUQCtNpbg5LO3DNW-_tRrMnYbsjACPt5hq0V2fcxV1OMCjdR7jVWDz1NUqu7UUsLzAyR-C7R8tPpj4piqQl4FLrlYyRH4YsjoTzGIRWxrVGNHgddzUX6j4ioXbTBziGZrUt5neg6NJc1v8qY4ARC3b6MTin4YgObZ_xzor6wfqmjIOApL-4vWpGA9yCgotlaw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAO5Ilxy5bRoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It premiered in Mzansi cinemas last Friday and has enjoyed international release too.“I saw it in Los Angeles, then in New York, then in Cape Town and now I’m finally seeing it in Joburg.”Kagiso said it was important to take the movie to an international audience first because that is where all the big festivals are. “That’s where you get value and where buyers see it. I made it for the world and I wanted to give the world the best possible chance to see the film.” What was most important for Kagiso was to tell a real South African story, rather than just perform it. “I’ve seen successful films but find they have a fairytale idea of what life in Joburg is like. I wanted to make something that could stand the test of time and represent my culture.”
