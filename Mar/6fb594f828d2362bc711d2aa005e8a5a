Both brothers were arrested and were due to appear in the Giyani Magistrates Court today.The older brother apparently decided to attack Cells, a grade 8 pupil, after his mum told him about the fight that took place at Mbangazeki High School. After Cells was stabbed, he managed to climb a fence to get into his neighbour’s yard but he fell and died a few metres from the door. Cells’ uncle. Eric Manganyi, said: “We were shocked to hear about what happened to Cells. He was a quiet boy and we didn’t know him as troublesome.” Limpopo police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the burning of the house was being investigated, but no arrests had been made yet.
