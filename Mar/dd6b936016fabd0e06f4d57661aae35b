Instead, she went back home to Tafelkop, Limpopo,” claimed Malose.He said he and his family travelled to her Limpopo home to discuss the matter with her family.“I got the shock of my life when Jeannette’s family proudly confirmed that they knew about the affair. “They told me they did not mind her seeing him.“It’s like they have two sons-in-law.”Jeannette eventually returned home with Malose, but two months later she packed up and left.“I love her, but if she chooses to stay with this man, then I want my R16 000 lobola back,” he said.Jeannette denied the allegations, saying: “He demanded that I take my child back home, so I told him that if he doesn’t love my child, that means he doesn’t love me.”Jeannette’s mum, Josephina, said Malose kicked her daughter out.“He came to the house and accused her of cheating. What kind of a mum tells a married woman to go see another man? “This is a lie. She stopped seeing that man long before they got married.”
