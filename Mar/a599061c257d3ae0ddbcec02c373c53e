Butterworth police spokesman Captain Jackson Manatha said the cause of the accident was not known so far but detectives were investigating. “The names and ages of the victims were not yet available,” he said. There have been several fatal car accidents in the Ndabakazi area. Too much blood has been spilled on this deadly stretch of road. A few years ago, churches gathered to cast away the evil spirits they believe are behind the carnage.In the second accident on Sunday afternoon, the woman driver of a sedan car with three women occupants lost control of the vehicle and it rolled near Tuturha Village, Centane, outside Butterworth. Manatha said two women died at the scene and the driver was airlifted to an East London hospital. “The other passenger was rushed to Butterworth Hospital. The cause of the accident was not known, but Centane police are investigating.“Police are investigating two cases of culpable homicide,” said Manatha.
