WHEN struggle veteran Ahmed Kathrada died on 28 March last year his beloved ANC, for which he had sacrificed so much, seemingly a corrupt nest of thieves. Yesterday, exactly a year after the death of Uncle Kathy, friends, family and comrades gathered at his grave site to commemorate his death and celebrate the ANC’s new dawn.Speakers at West Park Cemetery remembered Kathrada for his loyalty in the fight against racism.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvW0gkStB85auvTFQyblaY8H9EixuCg6iSimfuwhabI8tQCAf2rRNaEYKYKU94hATR0H6v8YshNOlQ3tF88fX3hmmr8f1Y9ezqWX0t3ChOAbY3-TERhG7HCgH_BwKPhSEwMAhTeuRpyOuHIEaYS2XhJLKwPob5DMOBv_WdYlrSZ4kS-3KLcRNnBxArn9qz2UTqD4YxPdfBGxzJAcDk7jqKlmm2upF8v8QuDKsJq0krKIdZju3cc1V4CrEVrxTfrayL1Z7i51Ch8AtbQ5sPClU1Tn3lWnMg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOXU_z5yObb3EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He must be happy to see Ramaphosa as the current president.”Sophia Williams de Bruyn, leader of the 1956 Women’s March and an activist, said Kathrada had been very deeply disappointed in the leadership of the former president, Jacob Zuma.She said: “Kathrada was disappointed by all that was going on when he asked Zuma to step down. State resources were being looted and that left people even poorer. “Kathrada stood for integrity and honesty. He must be rejoicing in the afterlife over the current administration,’’ Williams de Bruyn said.She said they hoped to see the current government fix all the wrongs done by the party in the past.Ahmed Kathrada Foundation spokesman Neeshan Balton said much would still be done at Kathrada’s grave, including the erection of a memorial stone.
