FOLLOWING their impressive giant-killing exploits in the Nedbank Cup, booting two Absa Premiership teams to book a place in the quarterfinals, Ubuntu Cape Town coach Casey Prince has urged his youngsters not to rest on their laurels. Ubuntu are the sole National First Division contenders in action in the Ke Yona Cup this weekend, as they are the lone lower league club left in the competition. They host Luc Eymael’s on-form Free State Stars at Athlone Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm) and will be hoping to continue their giant-killing act. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssnW95NHcbbhvXWhWuZnUu9zixMyrULqy20wEyNPTRPrBOLCDtwVluXkswaErlpRTSpcWET0YIpbm7gxk8Pk2M3cvm1CyCeDvhSGpds1l5EwzxQRVzTSFeDZJTbSw60GX_ZPECQYJShlAFI7rWyHaVugWuZIzqQ0GfZ-s3_7nQTHIIlFhDWAZz0pgm41SxdI1lENQgGg8RPY4k-o51iueZHIDqXHjEBDzxEWy7GlOQqEPF8hgp9osShuaNyIpEEIdatDwUEH1jWXATmWtOr7i4GsQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzI4jfh7ORs7-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We’re going there as underdogs with nothing to lose – we only need to do our best on the day. The boys have proven what they are capable of and should continue with that, without putting pressure on themselves.” Ubuntu are currently second from bottom in the NFD standings but that will not stop them from attempting to reach greater heights outside the league, says Prince, who aims to make history in the Nedbank Cup. “We might not be doing well in the league but this is an opportunity to shine and we must use it. To be the only team remaining from the lower league motivates us to continue doing well to ensure we reach the semifinals or even the final. “Baroka FC reached the semifinals in 2011, Mpumalanga Black Aces played in the final in 2009 while they were still in the NFD. We can do it too.”Stars defence have not been impressive in the 26 matches they’ve played in all competitions, conceding 29 goals. Against Ubuntu they will have to be prepared to work overtime, as impressive youngsters Kamohelo Mahlatsi (19) and Jesse Donn (18) have promised to continue where they left off against AmaZulu.Stars knocked out NFD side Super Eagles (2-1) and Chippa United (2-1) to reach the quarterfinals.
