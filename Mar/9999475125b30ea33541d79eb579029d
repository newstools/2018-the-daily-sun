The kids were too good for the national team as they showed their excellent bowling skills, with Proteas 51 all out at eight overs. They also showed some brilliant batting skills, hitting boundaries several times to score 51 runs. The kids scored 12 runs over the seven rounds by the Proteas during the super over to win the match.Lugxogxo was one of the three schools selected from over 20 000 schools in the mini-cricket competition. Thabisa Mkhwanazi, a spokeswoman for KFC Africa, said the aim of the programme was to give the kids a chance to play against their heroes.“We want them to have an idea of how it feels to play with professionals, because not all of them will get a chance to play in the national team. We also want to develop them from a young age.” Athini Mamkeli (12) won the man of the match. He said it was an extraordinaryexperience to play against the Proteas.School coach Tandazile Kundla said she was happy with the kids’ performance.Former Proteas captain Graeme Smith, the mini-cricket coach, said: “These kids are talented and have a very good understanding of the game. I hope to see most of them grow into something special one day.”Proteas batsman Reeza Hendricks said it was exciting to play against the kids.“There’s a lot of talent in this group and their fielding was outstanding.”
