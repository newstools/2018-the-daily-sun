Local teams have produced quality players, some of whom have gone on to ply their trade in the PSL or National First Division. In the past two years in particular, the tournament has unearthed exciting youngsters such as Lyle Forster, who now plays for Orlando Pirates’ first team, as well as Givemore Khupe, Lehlogonolo Matlou and Shungu Dutiro, who play for Bidvest Wits’ MultiChoice Diski Challenge team.Disappointingly, however, no local team has been able to win the trophy since the tournament’s inception in 2009.Wits’ Under-17s are the only side to have made it to the final. Dillon Sheppard’s youngsters showed determination and hunger in 2016, showcasing what they were capable of by reaching the finals where they lost 2-1 to Spanish giants Atletico Madrid.All eyes were on them last year but they couldn’t replicate their success. Sheppard is adamant, however, that they can repeat what they did in 2016 to reach the final and add the cherry on top by winning the tournament this time.He said: “Playing against the European teams always puts these youngsters under pressure at the beginning, but then as the tournament progresses they will often get more comfortable – only to realise that when it’s too late. “But having reached the final not so long ago, I believe we do have what it takes. “South African teams need to be on top of their game. Hopefully one of our teams brings something special to the table.”Pirates Under-17 mentor Augusto Palacios says Bucs’ main focus in this tournament is to produce more players for the Diski Challenge and first team.He said: “We use this tournament to ascertain which players are ready to be promoted to the first team.“Winning is not the main priority for us. We are looking more at developing players, where we have done well recently with Foster and Siphumelele Mbulu getting promoted. There are other players like that in our reserve team.”
