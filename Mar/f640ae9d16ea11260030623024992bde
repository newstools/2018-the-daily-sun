DEMOCRATIC Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane compared the motion of no confidence to be tabled against mayor Athol Trollip next week to witchcraft.Maimane was in Nelson Mandela Bay on Tuesday where he addressed dozens of DA supporters at the Babs Madlakane Hall in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage before the EFF’s motion of no confidence.He said: “What is happening here in Nelson Mandela Bay can only be compared to witchcraft and we will seek divine intervention to cleanse it for people of this metro. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvbThZMMk_pjnvSHDJCQKEwSKCg3t00cO92dKu0nb2hPZiUgeP-l7KazNgtLtxjglk0dUIM1To5cIpOY6Wgtd6LZwIPvpZvHfQZkuuF55z-xk5GNMGVEjp7DOE42ZPNNxpiUG_t5qnzzRmQvWoeVPkNrrX0PMRCBBmJyAfmMVGONI7Nkr4m3Mrd3yyJns25PQlvOgNNxkfd1n_XHrit0QPgjfpKT_5VzSDjPJcSwtyEuLBB0dpxs4I9lQ5slI0WAEgj3YDmE1_Or6UoYYDmkF7tx9PXxPQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP7QwjUGFch4EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

That is why they stole before. Now they want to steal again,” said Maimane.He added that he was in the metro to protect Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip. The DA stands to lose its leadership position on Thursday when council members vote on the EFF’s motion of no confidence against Trollip.The feud between the two parties started when the DA voted against the bill for land expropriation without compensation in parliament.This angered the EFF’s Julius Malema, who said Trollip was white and they wanted to get rid of his whiteness. Juju said the DA’s stance had earned them this punishment.ANC provincial spokesman Gift Ngqodi rubbished reports that they had submitted their mayoral candidate’s name to the EFF.
