The boxer said he wanted his title back and would be sending a strong message to all chancers at the expense of Kalombo.“This young boy is being fooled by his unbeaten record. Most of his previous opponents were unknowns. His only credible opponent was France Ramabolu, so to me he is a novice with one fight to his name. I will punish him to send a strong message to all other chancers,” said Mhlongo.“I’m tired of being in one-sided fights Kalombo has been sent to exact revenge for his stablemate Brandon Thysse, he is fighting other people’s battles,” he added.However, the opposite camp sees things differently, saying now is the time to send the veteran fighter into retirement. Kalombo’s trainer Damien Durandt said: “Yes, Mhlongo has experience, but we have skill and the power to tame him. “Come fight night Kalombo will be crowned champion.”In the main supporting bout Jackson “M3” Chauke will take on Sihle Jelwana for the WBF international flyweight title. Also on the bill tonight: Mduduzi “Triple M” Moyo v Chris “The Wolf” Thompson (cruiserweight), Dennis “Menace” Wale v Brandan Naude (lightweight, 6 rounds), Harnu “Bully” Botha v Mark Farah (junior middleweight), Etienne van Niekerk v Vusi Bilankulu (junior middleweight), and Baleshay Serge Mukanya v Akani “Prime” Phuzi (cruiserweight).
