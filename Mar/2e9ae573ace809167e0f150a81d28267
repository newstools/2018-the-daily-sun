Sibongile Mtheshana (51) from Bekkersdal, west of Joburg near Mogale City, said she threw the panties away.The following month, Sibongile’s daughter Thokozile (24) got a job as a receptionist at a security company in Joburg.A month after that Thokozile’s left leg got swollen and she was in and out of Leratong Hospital.“My leg only got worse,” said Thokozile. “It took on the shape of a crocodile and sometimes it looked like a snake.”“I felt fire moving through the left side of my body. My mum took me to different sangomas and churches and instead of getting better, the problem became worse.”She said while her mum was busy trying to help her to heal, her leg got swollen too.Sibongile said next her grandson Sphiwe experienced the same problem. They are all trapped inside the tiny shack, trying to survive on Sibongile’s disability grant. “We need help. We can’t all be stuck in our shack,” said Sibongile.Sangoma Precious “Dabulamanzi” Sithole said: “It is sad that they didn’t know about it and threw it away. “A good sangoma should cleanse the yard and help with strong muthi.” she said.
