EVERY Saturday, Constance Mathafeni goes to clean her local church and she’s greeted by filth. The 48-year-old told Daily Sun the last weekend of every month was the worst as scores of people would poke in the yard of Conquerors Through Christ Ministries in Ramaphosa, near Reiger Park in Ekurhuleni. “On weekends, they leave so many condoms and rubbish behind that it fills three rubbish bags,” she said. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuBVsLl7EKGTxH_qaYYTNbFjM9gFLyOUu_bzuaGV2t_Sc3NsKBP9r97Sn3spWR3nQ9AvzlHdY86qMWBXA3FuIE7BWhiBpsi7B3My79gwQTHMcalI3S0BiiSXrbHTja_Efg-dq6OQvVt24ekxdMtM81SnWyOoNwP0PBMrixc3X1F38-LbqXQWT9VM-XSEYShMMH7F9LVYblNfglfp7ztsHcoaXUWUWRKgs9-XcwBkQP5SUAShKVbagMGw_SvhBNeGcXERZ0TDcofsJUcSr-gl-akGQ4EfbY\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YSaz5vgT_J4FxGSk7esVvmy61woiD20AMxONcB1vKR1ZIBhr95n2PwcirV8DwnKNM1ClSe4omwps2kFKTprIsHthqJdoVrCAZ2tHTcDqw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCROhUbqQmVjEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The thugs stole our sound system three times. “After the third time, we decided not to replace it,” he said. Pastor Ngwale said they broke in on Sunday and stole chairs and broke windows. He said he was raising money to build a bigger wall around the church. The pastor pleaded with residents to help him take care of the church as it was used for community events and as a voting station. He said the church was not getting much support from the police. “There has been very little intervention from the police and people around here are reluctant to tell us who’s doing this,” he said. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said a case of malicious damage to property was opened.
