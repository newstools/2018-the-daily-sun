Sassa has a contingency plan for beneficiaries who need cash payments if the Constitutional Court says no to extending the CPS contract, but it warned that it will "be inconvenient".The Constitutional Court on Tuesday reserved judgment in the SA Social Security Agency's (Sassa) application to extend Cash Paymaster Services' (CPS) contract by another six months.The application was to ensure CPS can assist with a "phase-in, phase-out" period of six months, and to also continue making cash payments in rural areas.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstr9VbUyvz2HrEwGRV1SFFXJtSqGPUrwVyAhpuaQUKRkTg6TtKlWt1r4okE7tJdceekrv4m62FtsEKtcUTiqwyXBrOcLj6S-YI24Vpl1WTwHk7VH-LdDL21NPP9fuKYXH7QAN4_iziOv4e1lGT9i7KBg3EidgPJjuJU6iWqCg637th2BlK82f2ghdbcJ35-Ul0sCC0VYBYlR1dity4mAZ1-Zzu3r9TV_kKhRSpgoiFL7cMI3hMKlmwDKVrCOeFzI9blXsTB68CdLwcpiUBLWWM6iquYNkQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOLIJgphYpZFEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Their cards will have the money, they just require pins to withdraw the money from other outlets," Bhengu explained.These beneficiaries would need assistance on the day - receiving pin numbers and being pointed in the direction of, and transported to, the closest ATM.The bulk of these beneficiaries were elderly or had disabilities, Bhengu said.In the Constitutional Court on Tuesday, CPS warned of potential "chaos".Bhengu acknowledged that "it will be very inconvenient", but added that "chaos may be too strong a word". SA Post Office (SAPO) CEO Mark Barnes said SAPO was currently upskilling staff to assist with cash payouts at their counters. It wouldn't, however, cover all beneficiaries in need of cash.A phase-in process had started where, if a current Sassa paypoint was within 5km of a SAPO branch that met the norms and standards, that SAPO branch would take over the cash payments."As we speak, 743 people are completing their training to be placed at specific counters on March 16," Barnes said at the same press conference.He said another 2 570 people would get specific training, to be completed by March 30, but that there were no counters for them to be placed at yet."It won't happen on April 1, but there will be cash payments and a Post Office teller to assist in an orderly way, once the upgrade of those interfaces have been complete."The 5.7 million existing Sassa-Grindrod bank cards would be functional until December and the Post Office's new card would be ready in late April.Sassa project leader Zodwa Mvlane assured that beneficiaries had received the information, to ensure there was a seamless transition.They had been communicating at paypoints since December, as well as on community radio stations, at Imbizo functions and government events.
