The matter has been postponed to April 26 for sentencing.Nombiba’s guilt may not impact vote of no confidenceWhile Nombiba has been found guilty, all indications are that he will still retain his position as ward councillor until sentencing. This is critical in terms of the vote-of-no-confidence against mayor Athol Trollip scheduled for April 6, where every vote counts.City Manager Johann Mettler said council rules and regulations made a provision that looked at sentencing, not judgment.“If he is sentenced to 12 months imprisonment without the option of a fine, he will automatically become ineligible to be a councillor,” he said.Mettler said the matter could also be referred to the Rules and Ethics committee if the Code of Conduct had been transgressed.Nelson Mandela Bay council Speaker, Jonathan Lawack, who could refer the matter to the ethics committee for investigation, said they would wait for sentencing.“We will have to wait for sentencing, after which the matter will be escalated to the MEC Cogta for (his) removal,” he said.Had Nombiba been removed from council, as a ward councillor, his seat would have remained vacant until a by-election took place to determine his replacement.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-councillor-found-guilty-of-fraud-and-money-laundering-20180310-2
