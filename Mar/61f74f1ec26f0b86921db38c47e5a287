I was taught to be respectful, pray, drink a glass of milk a day and to enjoy sorghum beer. I don’t bother my kids or grandchildren because I can still do things for myself.” The gogo said she was born in 1917 at Modderpoort, near Ladybrand, and was blessed with four kids and nine grandchildren. “My husband died a few years ago. I believe I still have a few years to enjoy,” she said. “What keeps me fit is working on my garden and growing spinach.” Gogo Mamathinya said: “I may be an old woman but I’m still energetic. I try to live my life to the full and ensure that I stay away from alcohol. “I have 10 kids and my husband was a bishop. “My secret to a long life is mealie meal and lots of dairy products.”
