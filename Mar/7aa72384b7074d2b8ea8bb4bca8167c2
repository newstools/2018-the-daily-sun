We believe they have talent but they are currently inactive – and Ndongeni is one such a boxer. We looked at how things were, knowing that Ndongeni had been inactive for quite some time, so we came in to try and remedy the situation,” said Ledwaba. “Having him on the bill is a blessing, I would say, even more so knowing that he is one of the fighters the South African boxing fraternity loves to watch in action. He has been inactive for some time, and we felt this was not fair to him, in light of the talent he possesses,” he says.According to the former International Boxing Federation world champion-turned-promoter the future is promising for Gauteng based Nomeva as long as they are working together. He revealed that there is an international promoter who is keeping his eye on the former SA champ. “If all goes well we hope to take his career to the next level. Giving such boxers some action shows that we have their best interests at heart. Our intension is to keep Ndongeni active and eventually get him signed,” he says.The former unbeaten International Boxing Organisation champion has migrated from East London to Gauteng with the hope of advancing his career. He had signed a two-year co-promotional deal with then promoter Rodney Berman of Golden Gloves and his US counterpart Art Pelullo, who operates under Banner Promotions, but the deal did not bear fruit and he was released by Golden Gloves. Ndongeni left Mzansi’s shores last September to base himself in America with the hope of advancing his career there but it did not come to fruition.
