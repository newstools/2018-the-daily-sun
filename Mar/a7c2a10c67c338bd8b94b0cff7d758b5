Thirteen traditional healers who attended the course graduated at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Thursday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsukx4wCaqYFZfsjP_JzoYYiQfMVkwr3Hjp0F08mB4K_m_qNy0YUCGCEAb1en5W1H9mmbpbRCJpf_9I7gXbSRCchMtlsl66vFROKGH1ShL8aqNA1Wg5cEhTmNPruCci-KNvsoQQbTf8satwRlYA1XwAxmJwpYcNFVROGvsiKSTh_baf_Kxh46gsmu3ARCKHHT2Nx87qkBcklQK5H180qPW2O13xU51h3aDcFlC3Nt-zgRxVerWk4BYZjlCp-1ZayEfeXrmXzDTycSVJ75d-GUBvAVKGixfo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDUfcKEzkpWBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Make sure modern life does not overshadow our culture.”Councillor Zama Sokhasibe, who spoke on behalf of eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede, said: “We support the initiative. “We want those who were given certificates today to know they are appreciated by the City for the work they do.”
