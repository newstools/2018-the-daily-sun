Thirteen traditional healers who attended the course graduated at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Thursday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsubamNX2mwPK-7E-xYpqPu327oMa8aOF4zJleI6P9QJSOj4S_JjLAutotdAOzprQSoU8X7-jmOA_2IR-ZsAJjzuu1Zw41ChRMR0geDjMK8iRnA4vG_L506lDy9PT9JUKXNcpqtBxdOiA4Q14rPAvNoo5wpyQxGM5XlsDwAD7jG0WBapPcWiafR6yf0sumj9eNs3qxHFareQHL1gcyyfDg5Z5q1KKCwDG90pXdTq9haIgWLI_WodH86Qv3ET0o2PDT84i_54QJnHfjt8-jKc4O1PSQMrpKM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOlDKJY0-Gp-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Make sure modern life does not overshadow our culture.”Councillor Zama Sokhasibe, who spoke on behalf of eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede, said: “We support the initiative. “We want those who were given certificates today to know they are appreciated by the City for the work they do.”
