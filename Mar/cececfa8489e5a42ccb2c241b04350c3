Their commitment and fighting spirit at training during this Fifa break have been impressive,” said the 40-year-old, who helped Rise and Shine finish sixth in the Absa Premiership last season. “I am confident that our fans will see a totally different team when we play our next league match against SuperSport at Peter Mokaba Stadium on 4 April. This break has been helpful, we got a chance to look at ourselves and discuss things without worrying about the next game.”Molekwa admits this has been their most difficult season in the top flight. “I think this season has been tough for all PSL teams. Many teams are not safe yet, even those in the top eight cannot afford to lose a game. If we win two games in a row, we can be in the top eight. But for now, all we are thinking about is moving away from the position we are in.” Molekwa shouldered the blame for their slump. “Look, is not like we have been bad,” he said. “I am happy with the way the boys have been playing, it’s just that we draw many games. We score goals but end up conceding. We’ve identified the problem and I believe we will be ready when the league resumes.” In their remaining matches, Rise and Shine will face SuperSport at home, Platinum Stars away, Bidvest Wits away, Cape Town City at home, Free State Stars away and Chippa United at home.“Our remaining matches will be tough,” he said.
