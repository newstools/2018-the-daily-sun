They sell electrical gadgets, cement, bolts, pipes and many other things from their home.Lulama (41) and his wife Nobetheni Guzula (36) run popular Bardale Hardware opposite Parliament Primary School in Mfuleni. “We started our small business in 2003. We went on to sell hardware supplies on the side of the road that we transported in a trolley,” said the couple with four children.They said they only made it because they did their homework.“We sell products people actually need to buy,” said Lulama.“When we started the business, customers would come and ask for certain things that we didn’t have. We would then add those items the next time we bought stock. This is how we made it.”The couple also bought a bakkie for their business as well as a plot were they’ve built a house. This is where they run their hardware store.“Hardware is very popular. “Our customers save money because they no longer have to travel to town to buy what they need. We have everything right here,” said Lulama.The two are proud to have created permanent jobs for four kasi people.
