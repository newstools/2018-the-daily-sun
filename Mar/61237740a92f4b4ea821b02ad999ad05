A grade 7 pupil from Bavumele told Daily Sun: “I hold everything in until I get home, which is about 30 minutes away. If I really have to relieve myself I make sure there is someone to accompany me in case the toilet swallows me.”Another Grade 8 pupil from Amambalu said some kids relieved themselves behind classrooms instead of going to the toilets. Amambalu SGB chairwoman Nocwengile Ntabankulu said they had been trying to get the Eastern Cape Department of Education to build them proper toilets.“We don’t know if anyone has to first fall inside and die before anything is done.” Bavumele principal Ngqaleko Mangaliso said the school decided to allow grade R pupils to relieve themselves on the school ground for fear of them drowning in the toilets.“Their teacher accompanies them and they go in groups.”The department said however every school should set aside 20% of it’s budget for maintenance.Department spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said it was the responsibility of the schools to build toilets from their budget.“Our job is to make sure schools get their budget,” he said.
