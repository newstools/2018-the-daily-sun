Speaking to Daily Sun, Nkosi-Malobane told Daily Sun: “We were at one of the shops and the owner had asylum papers but no trading papers. When we indicated he would be arrested, he offered me a bribe of R1 500!” However, it wasn’t the man’s lucky day and he was arrested immediately. The MEC said she was shocked when the man offered a bribe. “People told him I was a senior official and that’s why he came and offered me cash. “People always say the police are corrupt when they are the first ones to offer a bribe.” Nkosi-Malobane said two other shop owners were bust for not having permits while another was bust for possession of mandrax. Makhura said they would visit other parts of the province unannounced. “We launched the operation last Thursday. It looks at law enforcement and crime prevention with Metro police departments, Home Affairs and an immigration team.” “We also raid drug dens. We want to work with citizens to make sure we drive down crime,” he said. Makhura said Gauteng had high levels of crime but thugs should be aware the authorities were coming for them.
