Despite his age, the madala wakes up early in the morning to go to work.He works in Aeroton, where he packs boxes for Nandos and McDonalds outlets.“All the employees here are blind. We always stumble over each other but we laugh and tease each another.” The father of four has 10 grandkids.The madala thanked the government for giving people like him the opportunity to work.When he was a young man, Aaron wanted to be a truck driver. He said he used to ride a bicycle before he lost his vision in 1966.Aaron was only 19 years old then. He also worked on farms in Sasolburg, Free State.He said despite his condition he enjoys life like any other person, even though he can’t see.
