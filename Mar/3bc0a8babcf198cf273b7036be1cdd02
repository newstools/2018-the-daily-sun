We are almost 3 weeks old,  growing in light and love. Our beautiful angel” she captioned a post on Instagram. Samkelo, who also plays the role of a new mom Lerato on eTV soap Rhythm City, has had to address unfounded theories from fans suggesting she was using her real baby on the show.She flatly dismissed that idea saying she is not "crazy" enough to expose her infant baby to that kind of environment this early in their life. Perhaps the post will help put an end to the rumours once and for all.A mom. A daughter. We are almost 3 weeks old?? growing in light and love. Our beautiful angel. ????A post shared by  ??Samkelo Samu/Samurai Ndlovu?? (@samkelondlovu) on Mar 5, 2018 at 12:06am PST
