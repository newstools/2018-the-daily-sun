He said before the lightning hit his home his brother’s home was struck, injuring four kids.David said before they moved to the area a few years ago, some residents told them not to build a house there. “We didn’t pay attention and now this tragedy has happened. I learnt the hard way,” he said. David said he wanted to move to another area but didn’t have the money to do so. He said he was left with only the clothes on his back as the rest of his belongings burnt in the house. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said an inquest docket was opened. KZN MEC for Co-operative Governance Nomusa Dube-Ncube called on residents to be careful as it continued raining in the province. “Our reports indicate the heavy rain that hit the Midlands and the northern and eastern parts of the province could lead to flooding,” she said. “We urge communities to be careful and to avoid low-lying bridges. Parents are urged to ensure children take safe routes to school.”
