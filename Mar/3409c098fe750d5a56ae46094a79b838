Attempted murder cases increased from 18 127 to 18 205 and robbery with aggravated circumstances cases increased from 132 527 to 140 956."National commissioner, this picture must change if we are indeed serious about fighting crime and regaining police confidence to the communities we serve," said Cele.Cele was the national police commissioner from 2009 to 2011.He replaced Fikile Mbalula as Minister of Police when Ramaphosa reshuffled the Cabinet last month.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/we-are-here-again-to-squeeze-the-space-for-criminals-to-zero-bheki-cele-20180309
