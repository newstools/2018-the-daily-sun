WWE wrestler Titus O'Niel, real name Thaddeus Michael Bullard Sr, is in Mzansi ahead of the WWE LIVE South Africa tour in April this year and is enjoying as much of what the country has to offer as possible.The former American football player took the chance to climb up Table Mountain with learners from Drakenstein Primary School during his stay in Cape Town as part of the promotional tour.The 1.98m tall wrestler then headed off to Johannesburg next to co-host an episode of Thursday Night Live with Marawa on SuperSport.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsupPBpG5Z-Qt6c_ar-3e3yeyqZcJ3ewQ19dfOrr-A7OUU59MQ3Y24r3aM4uDNA9wHmFQTMw5lFhlGIgg8OuA6AnmGULSaEdBJ0a0XW__6r6Z7xycjR58OVawQh9xdRsobnYL9TKwAKYTpdlMwnn04QkyCj8XghYHWEn6ZGuC7hEA9oADGwBor_nsCY4Xa12d6qYvOdg_PDRvTPswlO__26mbMDdQQGWtoj3Qq2LGjxfz3q2Gm2VuCfqCh85MEnnSENJ85vJJ4nUeW_r4nFPno1EVvNIMQ84pqXtHQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJVmeEGaOGYHEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
