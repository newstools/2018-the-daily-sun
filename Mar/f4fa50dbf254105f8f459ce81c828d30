PARIS, FRANCE - French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Tuesday that school will become obligatory for all children from the age of three, instead of six.This is part of his plans to shake up the education system. The move to lower the threshold would affect only a minority of families, with 97,6% of children already enrolled at school at age three, education ministry figures show. But Macron stressed that the change was intended to fight inequality in overseas territories and the poorest areas of mainland France in particular, where more parents opt not to send their children to school. “I hope that with this obligation from the start of the school year in 2019, we can correct this unacceptable differential,” he told a conference. – NEWS24if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssj1yg6alwN4O1VPzX5-xvSv49TBtwLes7TV9H-Mng65slKq9aV7g72ODsSiWsEMAl-USNcb0FX86aOJOo8PgJp4P9iUPm87WggfDHs3NusX9aLhIFhyR6ZJRXZB3ow__Hquwm_soi3U8w8v4EznWqjK6_0NGJOdCH2YdELgdbU4TaGM1Trwq5k_CXhD6n_woSYEFJehraunDrUNRnHkHMez7PrcwFpIslVBtj83k80j5b-D2OkhFKROdCV2OxpDR7vAKHcrppAzxFRn2T2rxYlVw-lcv5YAg1VlA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM3OPVPXoX4_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
