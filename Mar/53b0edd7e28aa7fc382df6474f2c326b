The tension between Afrotainment boss DJ Tira (Mthokozi Khathi) and West Ink boss Mampintsha (Mandla Maphumulo) is apparently said heating up.This after Mampintsha turned down an offer for Babes Wodumo (Bongekile Simelane) to perform at the Gqom In Concert festival.The event is set to take place at the Pavilion Shopping Centre in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, on 21 April.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Mampintsha is said to be still angry and unwilling to do business with DJ Tira, who is busy organising the talk-of-the-town shindig.Sources claim Tira asked Mampintsha for a quotation of Babes Wodumo earlier this month, but Mpintsho allegedly decided to hike the Wololo singer’s booking fee.“Mampintsha did that on purpose because he’s still angry at Tira. This war between them is far from over, despite Tira trying to put aside their differences. “Mampintsha doesn’t want anything to do with Afrotainment after what happened last year when Babes’s dancers left West Ink to join Afrotainment. What added salt to the wound was when Distruction Boyz left West Ink to work with Tira,” said the first mole.Another source said Mampintsha was being childish about the whole thing.“You have to put business interests first. Mampintsha is being childish because Tira is trying to show him that everything that happened with the dancers and the Distruction Boyz was all business. “He’s letting Babes down because this is Gqom In Concert and everybody knows there can’t be a gqom concert without Babes, since she’s regarded as the gqom queen.“It’s a pity because the only people who are suffering are gqom lovers,” said the second source.When asked for comment, DJ Tira said the fee West Ink charged for Babes Wodumo was too high. “We’re still hoping they can charge us a reasonable fee. We’d really like to have Babes as part of Gqom In Concert, but if the current fee stands, we won’t have her as part of the concert,” DJ Tira said. It will be sad not have her but the show will definitely happen. Babes has contributed a lot in the growth of Gqom music. Gqom in concert aims to offer more up and coming Dj’s an opportunity to display their craft. There is also Gqom conference that’s going to happen on the 18 and 19 of April at Moses Mabhida. Which will be free to aspiring musicians,” he said.Mampintsha and Babes Wodumo referred enquiries to their PR company. The PR company said: “We can indeed confirm that Babes is not currently part of the line-up for the Gqom In Concert festival. “And as much as we’d have loved for her to be involved Babes and the team are, unfortunately committed for that weekend,” said the PR company.They said the decision was “purely a business decision”, and that “there’s no beef there.”
