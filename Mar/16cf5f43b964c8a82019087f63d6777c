CHIPPA United could not have chosen a worse time to sack Teboho Moloi as they head into a tricky couple of fixtures that could potentially decide their future.According to sources close to the club, Moloi’s fate was actually sealed after their match against Orlando Pirates last week.Moloi was already a dead man walking going into the match against Cape Town City on Friday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss7VT1ojyx_39MW7zrTrdp1N1GLjlRjwZx0gAis1kCrkYEDT1M3zG3X5Fayh1Tmq2nj3_oa8fU2jkGVAg5CJs7I7PJIbxjOaBpxJHKEGg7hPnwBUuAfEsdWID4gqtmr4HkuLljak_Opro8YrdY-UTJhNjCpMk9VYVtm9r_Jyybty69BM0yVZ5HW_LZ9aqr1bI-9Ft52QiSijcLvrtPPiaC7qWsjdFhGKJ1ZbHQ_job8zdPv5iAdGDQW8gjlZ1X_3M0-UGW-Ak4_037xNmzb-2grxg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM-vMNzseW8OEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It seems everybody knew, except him.”But the decision to fire Moloi could spell trouble for Chippa, who looked to be in a stable position despite dropping nine points in five matches.They face high-flying Free State Stars in back-to-back matches, first in the Nedbank Cup Last 16 round on Saturday and then in the league a week later.While the knockout competition might not be a priority, an arduous task lies ahead for newly appointed coach Vladislav Heric, with big matches against Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs on the cards.Then there are fixtures against relegation-threatened Ajax Cape Town, Bloemfontein Celtic, SuperSport United and Polokwane City.But of great concern to Heric is the fact that Chippa are just a defeat away from a relegation dogfight, as they sit in 11th spot with 27 points, equal with AmaZulu and SuperSport, and just three above the relegation play-offs spot.They could soon find themselves in the relegation whirlpool.Added the source: “The chairman is ill- advised by people around him. They even go to the extent of putting pressure on the players. The environment had changed from the way it was in the first round of the season. Suddenly there was panic and a negative attitude all around. “Though they lost two successive games, the team looked on course to finish the season in a favourable position under Moloi.”Moloi would not be drawn on the allegations, but said he respected the club’s decision.Chilli Boys boss Chippa Mpengesi cited the lack of positive results for his decision, saying it was unfortunate that results were not favourable and that a decision had to be made.Heric has been given the mandate of ensuring Chippa qualify for the MTN8.
