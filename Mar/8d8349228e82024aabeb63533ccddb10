The municipality has advised families to check if the ashes of their loved ones are still in the niches as a number of them have been smashed. The SunTeam recently visited the cemetery and made shocking discoveries. The walls where the ashes are kept were full of holes where thugs had smashed their way in to steal urns and boxes. Many of the boxes placed in niches of the walls had been cracked open and some of the ash inside had spilled on the ground and mixed with the soil. Community members told the SunTeam the cemetery had become a playground for criminals and they had complained many times but nothing was done. Marriam Matseke (55), from nearby Birch Acres, said in 2012, she was shocked when she found thugs had tried to steal her late brother’s ashes. “It was barely three months after he died but the wall and the box were broken. Luckily, his ashes were still there and we decided to keep them elsewhere.”Kefiloe wa ga Khunou, a cultural expert from Alexandra in Joburg, said ashes should not be touched. “This must be condemned in all aspects. People must respect the cultures of others and leave the dead to rest, either as ashes or in their coffins,” he said. “In all cultures, religions and beliefs this is the deepest disrespect. “The nyaope addicts allegedly doing this must be possessed because a person of clear mind would not practise such inhumanity.”City of Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said they were aware of the problem and had put plans in place to guard against criminal activities at the cemetery. “We have introduced security at the cemetery to curb vandalism. There are also plans to put more fences up,” he said. “The city is aware of the escalating vandalism and crime at the cemetery. The city is working with the SAPS and the Metro police to find a working solution that will considerably reduce crime and vandalism. “An additional budget has been requested for security upgrades, repairs to the vandalised niches and to the perimeter wall.”
