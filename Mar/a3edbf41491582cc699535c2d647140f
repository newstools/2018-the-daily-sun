Fans of SAfm’s popular breakfast show, Forum at Eight are up in arms after their beloved Sakina Kamwendo was pulled of the air in what was supposed to be her last show.Producers and technical staff of the show were instructed by management to pull Sakina off the air and fill the remaining time with music.This is allegedly due to management’s unhappiness with what was happening on the show.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstIlsM8WmVB-jtJ5ZGzpCCnDOWh0LMfavrnF_AWOMEtDz2gC6J2zhNNKZ6SIIA6HOE1fOUuFHHrCy8rIqHBvLA7kPJVHtDWRa1nCWsUCToXtZfjvZJTggrFoeFDDJVRPJjXW9HSPgCYDtnBwtnekSm6OsilMytLUyf_VolaFJO9IpF0Y2goz7rZkRV2hXktJAMScPx8v0fWr0Noh-VbMr-oWwm4LfIraN0kTHE2EHqg98ew-rL76xcznrfz68KOY7SIQLbu2y4z4vfCtQ0mv113KCs5AS2g4_iwcQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMmC9DWjeP0FEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We’ve seen that happening in the past and don’t want the broadcaster to go back to the painful past, which was the norm under Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s leadership.”
