MAMELODI Sundowns assistant coach Manqoba Mngqithi is pleading with their fans to be patient with new striker Jeremy Brockie.Brockie has yet to open his scoring account in a Brazilians shirt since joining them from Tshwane rivals SuperSport United in a reported R10 million deal in January. But the New Zealand international, whom fans expected to make an instant impact for their team, has been struggling to regain his scoring appetite. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst1KSslkFzjhOfsJAP-QUVN0tIu_YII7VJ97bhtKx8rXdKJHcbCmASKaJd_XhmDKW6OUGFJDXlNl00p_qlEpVlXZaUBUn9-EUri8CnpfF7kYIJ7i--qzTSHrFmFQLBpIQfR73IEqVq_8TVN_qPMCQXpeNwAVeiyZnwhIGkGuB9ofs405uHC-Myg5jz8pY_f7N1J99pm7WN0eZSuzQ0z_6rCGDaRT_yXDHKpCNqBfLtRUPrl96BJnVucORLzPzcn1_JuUnfbeuupLFvz-zvX\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJrkM5t4Zz5SEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But Mngqithi came to Brockie’s defence after the 2016 Africa Champions League winners beat minnows ABC Motsepe League side EC Bees 2-1 in the Nedbank Cup Last 16 at Loftus Versfeld on Tuesday. The patience of Downs fans seems to be wearing thin where Brockie is concerned, as they were calling for him to be replaced in the first half against stubborn Bees.“I wouldn’t say he is struggling in front of goal. At times we can be too critical of players when they are not scoring,” said Mngqithi, who was in charge of the team while Mosimane attended a coaching course in Morocco.“I think we should give him a break. We know what he is capable of and the goal we scored came from him. He is not that exciting player who can dribble, but I can bet you he will score many goals this season. We need to be a little more patient and less anxious.” Mngqithi is well aware that fans want to see goals from Brockie and it has to happen soon. Hopefully the lanky striker will find the back of the net when Downs host Rwandan side Rayon Sports in the Caf Champions League first round, second leg at Loftus Versfeld on Sunday (6pm). The teams drew goalless in the first leg in Rwanda last week.Added Mngqithi: “I know that when a striker is not scoring sometimes he’ll start to panic and think ‘maybe I am not the guy everybody thinks I am’. We did not sign him by chance, we know what he can do. I see him scoring five goals by the end of season.”
