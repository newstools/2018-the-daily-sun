He said out of the country’s 4 300 chartered accountants, only 500 are black. “I encourage pupils to pursue this career.”The institute also provides funding to students at various universities.Pupil Esethu Noqakala from Mount Horeb Junior Secondary said it was an eye-opener. “I want to be an electrical engineer and now know which subjects to choose in grade 10. I was told there are many bursaries I could apply for.” Teacher Grace Mvelo said she was happy this year’s career expo focused on the grade 9s. “They’re telling kids what we’ve been trying to stress. I’m hopeful they will make the right choices.”
