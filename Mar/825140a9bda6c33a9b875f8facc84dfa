The first one had a heart attack and the second died of pneumonia.” He said the sangomas advised him to slaughter two cows but they died before they could perform the rituals. “The tokoloshe tells me not to fight it and it keeps demanding sex from me and my girlfriend,” he said.“It also tells me it wants blood. It told me I have to slaughter an animal every year so it can have blood.”Xoli’s girlfriend, Nomzamo Mbatha (23), said at first she didn’t believe the story. “I thought he was crazy and I encouraged him to consult a psychologist but that also didn’t help.“Sangomas told us that Xoli’s late father was the one who brought the tokoloshe, to make him rich, but his father died in 2016 leaving this thing unattended. The sangomas said it will kill us,” she said.Traditional healer Sangweni Mthimbeni (63) said Xoli was in trouble. “What he has is called mdliwa. It wants blood from him and he must address this problem soon or his family members will start dying, one after the other.”
