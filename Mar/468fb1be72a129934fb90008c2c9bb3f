As with all our cast members, we have been nothing but respectful, especially to her."The 48 year old said she can do nothing but pray for Mara “I pray mama Mara finds peace in her spirit and that is really all I can do for her “, she said.Connie said she was raised better than to be arguing with her elders and it was not the way she handles matter in any case."She is an elderly woman. With the way I was raised, it makes me extremely uncomfortable engaging with her on a mud-slinging level. It's not my style”, she added
