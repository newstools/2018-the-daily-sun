Paulos Monareng got early retirement from work more than 15 years ago.But over the years this father of three from Marokolong, in Hammanskraal has woken up every morning only to spend the rest of the day boozing with his friends.What Paulos eventually realised is that he has spent more on his drinking habit than his family’s needs.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>“I have spent lots of money on booze, and it has done nothing but cause problems between my family, friends and me, but it is difficult to give up.”Too many other South Africans have experienced this same sad story in their own homes.The need to create a national culture of responsible drinking came up recently in Joburg. There has to be an effort to teach a generation of South Africans how to be free of alcohol abuse.This effort combines the relaunch of the Industry Association for Responsible Alcohol Use as part of the Association for Alcohol Responsibility and Education (Aware.org.za). The rebranding symbolises the purpose of Aware: to push all efforts which can change the country’s drinking behaviour.“As a new organisation, we accept that we cannot keep doing the same activity and expect different results. We have to find different ways to nurture a generation of South Africans free from the scourge of alcohol abuse,” said Ingrid Louw, CEO of Aware.“Drinking comes with lots of emotional baggage and shame, which makes it easy for the abuser to deny and defend her or his drinking as a personal choice.“Nobody likes to accept that they have a drinking problem yet it is a problem we must all accept if we are to tackle the issue with the education and effort it needs.” Launched in December last year, with the Road Traffic Management Corporation, the #MakeOneChange campaign encourages people to take a hard but honest look at their own drinking habits and ask: “is this what I want?”
