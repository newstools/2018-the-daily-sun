IT’S not every day that dogs go to school. Yet, last week, dogs were behind desks at Thembalethu High School in George, Western Cape.The dogs weren’t there to learn how to read or write. They were there to do what they are good at – sniff stuff out. Over 440 pupils were searched by the women and men in blue.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvanocf6tNrJacSUqbhvEIH-uEHHoJdU969UMw0LuEzR0UeSV-Gyjk449ndu3yK-qZqYQ45BOXItwwcGwSNOo234y5b8gy8WKPLj25l2-7t-oA6F3Nn08YEDLI_NxHLtOrRUMsahUebSyeY42UwE_wenjhSve0MyEpPwfEnw6E6iT5tFwS_xZTNUWNg-rdcbDgQlgahslbA-3iL5kHFCAV5l5W_odm0J2N7GoHMY09CMP67L-R4kyfqvtLrfvMQCHI0qx5k0W79rQoZfYmuOyIXBokv21M\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNNKlNzNVMBYEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He said that’s why they raided the school.“Our search was an effort to make sure there were no dangerous weapons and drugs being brought to school,” said Gwavu. He said finding dagga at the school proved that pupils are involved in drugs. “We will continue raiding all the schools and pupils are advised not to bring any weapons or drugs to school,” he said.Gwavu told pupils to live as brothers and sisters and to solve their differences peacefully.
