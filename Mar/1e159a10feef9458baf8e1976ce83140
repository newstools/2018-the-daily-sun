A voice told me something horrible was going to happen at the school.” She said the voice wasn’t clear about what would happen but it instructed her to tell the school’s management to organise a prayer session. “I went there three times but no one listened.”She said the voice was still coming to her. “I think blood could be spilled. We have to gather and pray at the school,” she said. Principal Sam Tsotetsi said a big prayer meeting will be held this Sunday.
