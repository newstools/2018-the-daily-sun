Actress, model, radio, and television personality Pearl Thusi, hinted at a new relationship a few weeks ago after her much publicised split from television presenter Robert Marawa in August last year.The Real Black Pearl admitted on twitter last month that she was “falling for someone” but she has now revealed essential qualities that the man of her dreams should have after she was so impressed by a photo of a certain man on Instagram.For starters she likes men who regularly hit the gym because she is into men with “dope arms”. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuG8B0pwPoUXsI8puJ4i8Yp36k4CMNtkJaUvu4-apGu_yfqvInVGGrwyrE2U-UmPXJSFkatcCVYIlohs7mNPWiSNtyD2b_VS-ZEAv5e37ONd1g-n4zIph34YyOYMGbofJYdFra1sfgYMp4IYN2VcKR1hGFFxTiMz_M8Y4cIzUJajfB5kICTXim1SqDEUYg8NxmMII-BD2S3xlfnuGGODA-zi4odM9HKCJmPS1ScZpiWlEr9QnP4ddx_Rughsrx7lWcnBmPCTw3q0Z5KfpG1oid6BRi4iwgFwlJG1A\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLm8FvGhN62pEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
