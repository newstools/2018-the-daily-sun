girlfriend was found burnt in a veld in Lyndhurst Johannesburg.Mantsoe who is a married father of three, was allegedly in a
romantic relationship with Mokoena since October 2016.The couple had a seemingly chaotic relationship, with
Mokoena at some stage reportedly laying a charge of assault against Mantsoe.Mantsoe has denied killing Mokoena, but during the bail
application admitted to disposing of her body.
