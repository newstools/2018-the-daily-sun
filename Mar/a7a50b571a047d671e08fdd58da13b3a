evidence would be completed and provided to the defence by next week.Mantsoe, 27 was arrested after the body of his 22-year-old
girlfriend was found burnt in a veld in Lyndhurst Johannesburg.Mantsoe who is a married father of three, was allegedly in a
romantic relationship with Mokoena since October 2016.The couple had a seemingly chaotic relationship, with
Mokoena at some stage reportedly laying a charge of assault against Mantsoe.Mantsoe has denied killing Mokoena, but during the bail
application admitted to disposing of her body.
