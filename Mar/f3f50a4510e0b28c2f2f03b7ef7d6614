When Elizabeth Robertson, 74, started her master's degree at Stellenbosch University, her fellow students thought she was a new professor on campus.Once the students found out she was one of them, they were polite, respectful, and turned, like her, to stressing about whether they would pass."I am still astounded," said Robertson, of her graduation on Thursday last week with a master's degree in ancient cultures, cum laude.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstEhOvPbCLFDpIw-nJZyuHieCeCTtmkZekUdU2KNaNk9EeLGbIiob1KZUEsmBHuparkk2MLxSHOZIPkRjkvau_GKNd8eOcS0HrvbhInTB8fPd4C_Vr06pU2ogR1JkmdnuWc_E5zeZyNUvxaqXhpb8VGdgJHACgpNURYRPgAmbI5ZDH3jEp90bhxjN7qmxwfGCkvhpMOJRCNiB8KhBrYtwKsNAD9Cbl69Q4BphxHCzXyVGpOKSEnzs9Pfd-hEMTSRxw7WFKmS_0QrF8qxHl2EYHnCIuO9oU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzO6rPL_eLY7_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Robertson did not know anybody except her daughter and her daughter's family.She felt it would be unfair for her daughter and her family to keep her entertained, so when she saw an advertisement for a postgraduate diploma at Stellenbosch, she signed up, and completed it in 2014."I thoroughly enjoyed it," she said."When it was done I didn't know what do with myself. So I thought I would do a master's."She said the last three months of the programme were difficult and draining – "a nightmare really".Asked for advice to other students struggling with the last long haul, she said: "Think how much it has cost you in blood, sweat, and tears. Don't give up. It's just the last hurdle."Although Robertson reads a lot and misses the depth she found in the books she read for her master's, for now further study is not part of her plan."But I won't say never," she laughs.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/dont-give-up-says-74-year-old-masters-graduate-20180323
