How on earth do we keep on trusting politicians to build us a future that they are not prepared to be part of?If politicians who are in charge of government are not forced to use public service, then we will never have proper functioning public institutions.I pity the poor who have no choice because they will continue to suffer at these institutions.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu835vjQ4xPAe6MfYHDZbDpxp36_D8k0jsKNVpK4JjiwWxCfXzMeb7DvK6RIQhZ352Ybrpaq4VaDqSIku-1XKRQSXNu80W3MS-Q9sE7ylNiHppflmsRIoxKFTruBe7Fsiw13wC0TFV3bSWJcDUnTUBXUFrPjdsWoSHIEDcbz4McPCZCBcZgWKXEhQxm90On7gr6MX-0T9YxyWAs6te4H0vKT-LaxO5G5Qs3W_LQQkGQb6y-Hiuz2ix7K56AaYHR0rKjmZfav22eJFaTanhj6whYnLDQIXo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEQ19c8MQbzdEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

After all, all inventors test their inventions before they release them into the market. This is but one of the many ways we could try and get the best out of our public institutions. They will ensure we have a better health system if their children will one day end up on public hospital bed.And I'm not talking about the PR exercises like the ones done by health minister Aaron Motsoaledi when he announced he was being treated at a public hospital.He was attended to by the best the public service could offer and was most probablyÂ  kept in a separate ward, just because of his status.If Dr Motsoaledi indeed needs public hospital experience, he should allow his children to be admitted to the Jane Furse Hospital near his home in Limpopo or Tembisa Hospital if they live in Gauteng.Let them spent a whole day queuing at a clinic only to be told they had run out of medication when their turn comes later in the afternoon.They will definitely tell him the real account of how is it like to use a public hospital or clinic.You don't just rock up there with bodyguards and cameras and expect to see the reality that ordinary people suffer on a daily basis.Same as education, the poor suffer at public schools while sons and daughters of politicians get the best education at private schools.If their kids had to attend the public schools by force, they would have long developed these schools to the level of private schools, because no parent appreciates their kids getting an inferior education, where even science experiments are done theoretically.It can't be that in this time and era, students from the rural Limpopo and KZN only learn how to use computers for the first time at tertiary. How on earth do we keep on trusting politicians to build us a future that they are not prepared to be part of?How sure are we that it will ever be a better future? We were only going to be certain if they were prepared to share in it.I must state that this is not an original thought. It has been raised time and again and I just think it needs to be rubbed in until it gains popularity and ultimately gets implemented.Once they get blue lights, these guys even forget how it feels like to be stuck in traffic on your way to and from work. I have always believed in the saying that experience is the best teacher. If they can feel it, then they will deal with it. The biggest setback with most African countries is that political leaders is that cant entrust the future of their own kids with what they are building for their nations.They don't even get sleepless nights at a stagnant economy because they know their political connections will help their own children get employment whenever they need it.They don't panic at the lack of development in anything because they know their kids will get private development elsewhere.
