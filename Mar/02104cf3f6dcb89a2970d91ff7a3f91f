The South African public broadcaster is owed a whopping R25 588 801 443 (twenty-five billion, five hundred eighty-eight million, eight hundred one thousand, four hundred forty-three) by people who have SABC TV licences but who refuse to pay their annual fees.South Africa's latest minister of communications – the 10th minister of communications in 10 years – Nomvula Mokonyane, has replied to Phumzile Van Damme, the Democratic Alliance (DA) political party's member of parliament who wanted to know what the outstanding amount is that the SABC is due in SABC TV licence fees, what amount of money the SABC wrote off in unpaid debt and what the SABC's total number of SABC TV licence holders are. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvIZLIO8-1ZWg3Gcj3bCwIbZi3u-RAk_LKZ_j78igF7CXpkO4FYkQ7peGaYHRuG1HJ_eCNkx2-fUsIaugjH2NZF3u2Gi2lclQHeYHnOy84Q6t0nmHIkXSleWNP2km0EXhSUJFjJwCw04iZss0fZ4IYNiaMHyvw8g3j6yP5xVwx6EuwKSLWlLBjbh4wcxOkBFnVHzoJ8o6oFap_wKNdSs_--Cw5kfiUKXFGXAjnKdC77haJMGszgrVyNDI-x_YPonozoC-fpyPzO1npp17_kiWfgQ8zVG3M\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEJ8gmAi-UnxEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
