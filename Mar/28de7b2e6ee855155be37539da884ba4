THE FACTS Silindile Metwa from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, Gauteng said a close friend of his grandmother claims the house that he is living in belong to them. Silindile’s father and grandmother passed away and he is the only living relative. The people claiming to own the house, have a copy of a will which he said looked forged and they did not have a permit for the house. He wanted to know what he could do to protect his interest in the house and to prevent being evicted. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>WHAT I DID I spoke to SCORPION LEGAL PROTECTION to find out what Silindile’s rights were. SOLUTION As the surviving relative of his grandmother, Silindile needs to report his grandmother’s estate to the Master of the High Court. He must also indicate if there is a will in existence and that as far as he knows his granny did not have a will. The Master will summon the possessor of the will so that it can be determined if the will is valid. In doing his determinations, the Master will investigate if there are any other family members who may qualify to inherit intestate. To help his case, Silindile should gather other family members, close neighbours or friends who can show that he is the remaining heir to his grandmother and that it is unlikely that she would leave the house to someone else. While the Master is busy with the investigations, the other person cannot evict Silindile. The other option that Silindile has, is to appoint an attorney to apply for an Order from the High Court that would declare the will invalid. You can strike back legally too!Click here
