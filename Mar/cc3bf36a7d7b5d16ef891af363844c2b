Meanwhile, EFF leader Julius Malema yesterday said Enterprise and Rainbow Chicken must take responsibility for the Listeriosis outbreak. He said all the companies involved should compensate those who were infected and killed. “We’ve instructed our lawyers to take action against companies involved in the spread of Listeriosis,” he said.“There is no disposal plan for withdrawn products from stores as they’re back in circulation.” He called on EFF members to remove from supermarket shelves all products that were declared to spread Listeriosis. The World Health Organisation has declared Mzansi’s recent outbreak the largest in history.
