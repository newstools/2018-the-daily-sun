This space belongs to the women and children of South Africa,” he said.He said the police will always come out victorious in its war on criminals.“If you decide to go to war with us, I can assure you there will only be one side that will survive and that side is us.“We shall refuse to fall and kneel in front of criminals.” he said.“If you want peace, you will get peace,” he offered.Cele urged cops to sharpen their skills to prepare themselves to fight crime in the country.“This is an organisation of excellence.“We will not accommodate anyone who ruins the name of the SAPS.“If you think you are here for other things, please walk away,” he said.“He will lead us into a new dawn, aware of the criminal justice system dynamics and how we can improve in all spheres.”Cele was appointed police minister by President Cyril Ramaphosa, replacing Fikile Mbalula during the recent Cabinet reshuffle.In June 2012, Zuma fired Cele from the post of national police commissioner and replaced him with Riah Phiyega.
