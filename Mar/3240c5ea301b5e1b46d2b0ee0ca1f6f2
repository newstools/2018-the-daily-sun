He asks her to marry him.Siku ne Siku means day by day in Swahili.“As the name of the song says, my love for him grows day by day,” said Candy.Although the story in the song does not apply to her and Nonny D, the essence of it is all true.“I see in his eyes that he truly loves me,” she said.“I thank God he came around. He is someone I am getting closer to so that makes the story true.“We are singing from the heart but some of it is fantasy.”Candy said the inspiration for the song came to her while performing at the Moshito Music Conference and Exhibition last year.The lyrics just came into her mind while on stage.Afterwards she approached Nonny D and Nigerian music producer Dr Frank, who produced the song.It took them just three hours to bring the melody to life.Candy said she made the song because she was tired of hiding her love for Nonny D,” said Candy.“We didn’t want to hide anymore. We’ve been dating for a while and it is not a secret.“People are already talking about it. We have a working relationship and behind the music, of course, we have our personal love relationship.“The song speaks about love and I feel it because I’m talking about the truth.”She said she’d soon introduce Nonny to her family.“I haven’t introduced him to my family. But very soon I will introduce him.”The song has a beautiful blend of South African and Nigerian melodies, which Candy calls indigenous Afro soul.The arrangement of the sound on the single is a teaser of what the full body of work will sound like when Candy releases her upcoming album at the end of April.The album will feature Stoan Seate, Busiswa, Malatji, Benny Mayengani and Sho Madjozi.
