We expect a tough clash but we do not fear them. “This is just a game of football, anything can happen. We know Free State Stars play a different game to Polokwane City or AmaZulu. They have quality players but we also have talented players in our squad who are ready to do the job.” Prince said his charges had already started dreaming about playing in the final in Cape Town.“It has been a good ride for us in this competition – we do not want it to end on Saturday,” he said. “The boys are hungry to do well and have already started dreaming of playing in the final right here. But we need to take it one game at a time.”Prince will be hoping the likes of Ranga Chivaviro, Clint Federicks, Duncan Adonis and the experienced former Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Franklin Cale will help his team thrash Luc Eymael’s on-form Stars, currently among the PSL title contenders.But Ubuntu will have to be in top form if they are to upset Ea Lla Koto, who will be relying on skipper Paulus Masehe, Siphelele Mthembu and Nhlanhla Vilakazi to keep alive their dream of lifting the Ke Yona trophy.
