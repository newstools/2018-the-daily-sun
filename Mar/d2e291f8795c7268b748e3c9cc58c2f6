According to witnesses, the driver of the truck cut a corner when he turned from Royal into Station Road.Witness Wellington Machange said: “The driver turned earlier than he was supposed to and his trailer ended up climbing on the pavement where the boy was walking with his friends.”According to another witness, the boy was wearing earphones and didn’t hear his friends warning him to get out of the way.“He was crushed by the trailer. Six wheels drove over him,” said another witness.Pupils from Maitland High School said they rushed back to school to call their principal but when they returned the grade 10 pupil was dead.Nomuthandazo Dulasi, another witness, said:“This is so heartbreaking. “I can only imagine how painful it is to lose a child like that. “When that boy left home, his family probably expected him to come back in the afternoon.” Members of the community said it was not the first time a truck had killed a youngster in the area.“Last year a truck ran over a five-year-old,” said resident Marian Peterson. “He also died on the spot.”Western Cape police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: “The circumstances surrounding a culpable homicide case are being investigated following the death of a 16-year-old male. He was hit by a truck on the corner of Royal and Station roads.”
