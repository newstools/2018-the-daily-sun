He arrived almost 12 hours after he was supposed to perform. “When he arrived, he didn’t even enter the gate but told us he would refund us because the event was over. To this day, I have not seen the money,” said Lucas.He said Monada had been dodging his phone calls since the beginning of the year. When the SunTeam contacted Monada, he confirmed arriving late. However, he said he didn’t owe anyone money as he had refunded the person who contracted him. “If Lucas has not been paid, he must check with the middleman who spoke to him and me. He must get in touch with the people he was dealing with because he was not speaking directly to me.” Barry Ledwaba, the middleman who allegedly received the money, said Monada had three gigs on that night, which was why he was late. Barry said he was only paid R15 000 of the R45 000. “I will send the money to Lucas. I told him about the money I received but Lucas said he wanted the full amount and not R15 000. “Lucas must just accept the R15 000 because the stadium was full and he made money. Alternatively, I advise him to organise another event where Monada can perform.”
