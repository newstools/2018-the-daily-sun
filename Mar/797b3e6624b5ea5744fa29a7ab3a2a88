FOLLOWING their fourth straight Absa Premiership match without a win, Cape Town City FC coach Benni McCarthy says he is not worried about his future despite their below-par performances and poor run of form. The former Bafana Bafana star claims he is not losing sleep over the club’s lacklustre showing which has seen them drop 12 points  and down to seventh in the standings with 31 points and seven games to go. Baroka FC inflicted the Citizens’ fourth defeat in the Absa Premiership at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Tuesday night with a 2-0 victory. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuqjwppbAABlL7ytc6LgTKO-CDO902pJwKQx4V0X9gJ4OIBIgD4Olmfo6_--TMCwf04D84JkYl-RS9X6DnFCLRy6jQGe-PoplCgPczQdrhkgFisXMcRR_u5ny5gVWW63NuVYl2gtt4VmofICEB68bL_2weuhV7X4768WXTAYKxVBFJKerADbTDPO3XI1ht0z9slM76P6Sgwdg3uN4eXp11BHcR9puEbgWxUDu9xPwyw3RowSz8GHHg1OHCeKIjUUbJVEUURYiGD5hHlTwrc0Lkf5A\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDCjqLK2_7PZEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I will just continue doing the job. I’m a first-time coach, people can say whatever they want. Show me another coach who has done what I have done in his maiden season.” McCarthy called for calm as he urged his players not to panic: “We are not Ajax Cape Town or Platinum Stars who are drowning. We are in a lifeboat.” McCarthy said he’d reached a cup final where he lost in penalties to SuperSport United in the MTN8 and they had been in the top eight all season. He said: “I’m not looking for excuses. I don’t feel sorry for myself. “The chairman has to do what he has to do for his club, and if he feels that firing me is the solution it’s okay, I will go. But I highly doubt that because of the conversation we had. I have his full backing.” McCarthy said there were other coaches in the league who should stress about their future, but not him. This run of poor form has been a repeat of the first round, where City lost four games in a row. Like this story?
