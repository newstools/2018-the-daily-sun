They threatened us with knives and demanded money,” she said. “But suddenly the thugs ran away. They saw the ghost we had been trying to chase away!”Sibongile said they accepted the ghost after it saved them.We feel like it is a member of our family now,” she said. Her son, Zanoxolo (29) said they went to church and when they came home they found the kitchen door open and footprints on the floor. “But nothing was stolen. We believe our ghost chased those thugs away too,” he said. Sangoma Jabulani Mthimkhulu said the ghost could be someone who died in the house but whose family had never cleansed the ghost’s spirit.He advised the family to get rid of the ghost, because “it could turn evil”. But the Mabasos said, the ghost was not going anywhere.“We love our ghost,” they all insisted. Sibongile said when they saw the ghost it was tall and wore long white clothing.They could not tell if it was a man or a woman.“It roams around our yard, patrolling,” said Sibongile.
