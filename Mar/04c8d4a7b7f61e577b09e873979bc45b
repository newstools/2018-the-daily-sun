They attacked cops who attended to a complaint in Tsakane sector 3. Fists and bottles flew when the cops arrived at a tavern where a fight between members of rival gangs had broken out. “Our crime prevention members received a complaint about a fight from a member of the community.and proceeded to the scene of the crime“When they arrived, they parked a few metres away and walked into the tavern. That’s when all hell broke loose,” said Sibiya.“Among the arrested suspects were the men who allegedly moered the cops who arrived on the scene first and threw bottles at their van,” said Sibiya.He said when a cop tried to intervene in the fighting, his colleague was attacked by one of the men. Another man threw an empty bottle at the police vehicle, damaging its windscreen. Two more police officials arrived to assist but a group of unknown men wanted to attack them as well. Sibiya said the men swore at the police and attacked one of them with a golf stick. The cops managed to arrest six suspects.  Cases of assaulting a police official and malicious damage were opened. The suspects are due to appear in the Kagiso Magistrates Court soon.
