I’m now approaching old age and nothing has changed. Mandela promised us a tarred road in 1995.“After him, different officials from the municipality and the department of transport promised that the road would be tarred as construction was in the pipeline.”Ndabezinhle said the road was used by a number of delivery trucks as there are factories and malls in the area. “Every now and then the road is levelled but due to the high number of trucks and buses that use the road, it ends up being pointless. There are big potholes and when it rains, they get worse.”He claimed the ward councillor told them construction of the road was the duty of the transport department, not his responsibility. “When we contact the transport department, officials tell us that there are not enough resources and there are many roads being constructed.”KZN police spokeswoman, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, said: “Public Order police and Empangeni police were alerted to the situation. There were no injuries and was no damage. No case was opened. Police monitored the area until the road was cleared and everything went back to normal.”Umhlathuze communications manager Mdu Ncalane said: “Residents knew they should direct their demands to the transport department as the issue of that road concerns the department, not the municipality. What we did on Friday was to send residents an official from the department to address their demands.” KZN transport department spokesman Mluleki Mntungwa said: “I have contacted our representative in Umhlathuze to report back to me because as far as I know two huge roads were recently built there and one of them is finished. I will have to get full details on road P494.”
