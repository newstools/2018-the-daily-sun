The Limpopo Department of Education is apparently hesitant to rebuild their crumbling, damaged school because the number of pupils is too low anyway.Parents and the SGB won’t allow pupils to use classrooms and space at a nearby primary school.Learning under the trees is going to be a challenge now that the rainy season is here.The People’s Paper published a story about the school two weeks ago.Limpopo Education spokesman Sam Makondo said the department planned to build a new school in Nomparella. But he said there were processes that had to be followed.“We also learnt that some of the classrooms can be used,” he said. “But parents locked the school gate with the intention of getting a new building.“It was also reported that the number of pupils stands at 90, instead of 200 pupils. “Now we’re investigating whether or not to merge the school.” Makondo has pleaded with the SGB to allow the affected pupils to use the extra classrooms at a nearby primary school.SGB member Jess Ngoepe said they were sick and tired of empty promises. He told Daily Sun they reported the matter several times to the department, but nothing had happened. “We can’t risk our kids’ lives by sending them to a damaged school,” said Jess. He claimed the building has cracks everywhere. “It’s better for our kids to learn under trees instead in a damaged building,” said Jess.
