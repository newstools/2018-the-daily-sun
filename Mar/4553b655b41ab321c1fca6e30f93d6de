Friday when they were bust stealing pork.According to The
Monitor, Patrick Magada (20) and Isaac Mutebe had visited the Nabirumba
Road Pork joint in Kamuli, north of Kampala in Uganda.They then ordered a kilogram of fried pork. While they
waited for their order, they flirted with the female chef in the kitchen.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsurmo8p2C40G7tUqKfctCCg4Z2JQU_gwKYeRkvhuPMFGM0lfpv6i1p3t_c5ybPTypsXC6dmSRQL3phy8pNz6obkjSkdM9nOpwoT6x53qrHDzF7w4Izmb1fPdr6KfAwqrEWb4tCZ-2xv0dMLChyEcLafhBFXoU3ttJuuewebGqSADCTVNTBoDMazkoZPSe2XjY5Vl6dr5Dc5KLiKVZdMaC-CYP0XJXjr2fpP0RUpHrzexwI3Kjg3XRihK2zV49GEoYnwAu0r-dBShraV5K37H2rr7aRFwAnlucxnYg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPKzqX3Z6OeeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

customer’s plate which had yet to be served. He hid the meat in the pockets of
his jacket.But the chef wasn’t as distracted as they thought. She
first noticed the pork was missing from the plate – and then she noticed the
bulges in Patrick’s jacket pockets!The chef’s yells raised the alarm and a crowd gathered
and started to moer the two men. According to cop Samuel Muhoozi, they would
have been hung by the angry mob if the police hadn’t rescued them.On their way to Kamuli cop shop, the two apparently
confessed that they stole the pork because two women they had been entertaining
had asked for some. They couldn’t afford to buy it because they only had money
for the lodge fees and their transport back home in Jinja, about 60km away.
