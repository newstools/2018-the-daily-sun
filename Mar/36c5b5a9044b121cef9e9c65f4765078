However, the paramedics told me to hang in there as they would not be able to assist me inside the ambulance because it was filthy dirty,” she claimed.“I arrived at the centre and gave birth at 5am. At 8.30am, I was told by the nurses that my baby had died. “They threw the dead baby next to me.”Keikantsemang added: “I was forced me to sleep with my dead baby for seven hours because I was told I had to arrange a funeral parlour to come and remove the tiny body.“I was so heartbroken and traumatised I called my mum.” She claims she was not given food or water, and didn’t receive any counselling. Her mum, Kelebogile Ndebele, said: “It was heartbreaking to find my child sleeping with my dead grandchild.“She was traumatised and helpless. We only managed to organise a funeral parlour at about 4pm.”Kelebogile said they want the health department to be held liable for negligence.Health Department spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said: “We take these allegations very seriously and have assembled a task team to investigate. Normally when someone dies it is up to the family to organise a funeral parlour.“However, it is also our responsibility to keep the deceased at the hospital mortuary until the family is able to remove the body.”
