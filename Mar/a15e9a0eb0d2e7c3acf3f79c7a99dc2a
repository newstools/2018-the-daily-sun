But the Scot is willing to take a calculated risk to ensure he gives as many youngsters as possible a chance in the tournament.“We’ve decided we are going to try and look at everybody. I don’t want to send Ramahlwe (Mphahlele) back to his club having played two matches in a short space of time,” said Baxter.Baxter confirmed Orlando Pirates assistant coach Rhulani Mokwena won’t be part of his technical team, owing to a failure to follow protocol regarding his invitation to join the national team.“I’d prefer to see everybody. We are trying to work out beforehand who is suited to face Angola.”Mphahlele is among the senior players in the 25-man squad, the Kaizer Chiefs defender bringing a wealth of experience to the side, having played internationally at both junior and senior level. “The senior players will be important to guide the youngsters in the right direction, to put an arm around them if they don’t have a great game?.?.?. that sort of thing. Though they have been in the national team before, they won’t have a crystal clear picture. I want to give them a fair chance.“Of course I want to win, the country wants to see us win. But we have to take a calculated risk. Someone once said you never lose, you either win or you learn.”Apart from defender Buhle Mkhwanazi, who has a slight knock, Baxter has no injury worries.He said: “We only have one session today (yesterday), a snapshot of a few different elements of the game. We’ll do some work on the brand new back fours and some work on possession and penetration. “We’ll have another warm-up session, a normal pre-match session.”Mphahlele said Bafana were still recovering from the big setback of failing to qualify for the Russia World Cup.But he added that there was no more time to wallow in despair, as they face a new challenge. “Unfortunately, as a football player, you have to dust yourself off and move on.“We don’t want the youngsters coming in to find us with our heads down. We have to give them confidence, courage and hope that they can do well.”
