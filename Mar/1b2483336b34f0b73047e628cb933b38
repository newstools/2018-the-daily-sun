By yesterday, cops and divers called to the scene had not found his body. Simon Nkabinde, who uses the route daily, claimed people don’t fall into the dam but are pulled into the water by a hungry snake. “Why is it that every year at least one person slips and falls into the water?” he asked. “Surely that’s how the snakes feed?” Residents showed the SunTeam the frail structure they use as a bridge. Meanwhile, Lucas’ relatives gathered on the banks of the dam. His brother Mandla 45) said: “I hope people will learn from this incident and maybe government will do something.“We can’t have people dying here every year and nothing being done about it. Women and kids also cross here.”Bronkhorstspruit police spokesman Captain Sipho Zulu said the search for Lucas was continuing.He warned people to stop using the short cut.“It’s illegal for people to cross there,” he said. “There’s a road created for them that’s safe and they should use it and stop putting their lives in danger.”
