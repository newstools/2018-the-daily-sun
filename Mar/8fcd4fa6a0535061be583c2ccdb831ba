Heavy rains in Johannesburg over the past two days have affected graves and headstones at the newly-launched Olifantsvlei Cemetery, the City of Johannesburg said on Friday.Some graves and headstones have collapsed and memorials placed on graves have been washed away by the subsequent flooding in the area."In order to preserve the dignity of the dearly-departed residents of our city, Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo will offer soil to families whose [loved one's] graves have been affected by the erosion caused by the rain, and will additionally refill the graves once the rain subsides," said councillor Nonhlanhla Sifumba.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssysmvdwYJl1nWBkOCDVMg9_udWhhc1elnCwP1pRFJUkwb9qsHRJ0zPu9n8bAYfWoIm02nde-ro3wSARDoont8XO7ir8kNyHZfbZD6X4T0ThWp1KydSUFTKMyDs9j43jfLvTNEyxteawOnWblIeYJVaU8iGahRTj4jsYTdq4B007YO2CKxfJkIZ7FCz5eZgyBQPVv_GSsWxd_KsZbvoqzn0JVpx6vcYukriGoBBYgZQOiq48zfPii9TNT_gP1Ud1E48ZNpJ0HlwmBdbF4AwoQJfgTNBGzM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzH7H7lw8MIvzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The cemetery is expected to accommodate a total of 800 000 burials.The heavy rainfall has wreaked havoc on the roads and traffic in Johannesburg. Severe flooding was also reported on Witkoppen Road and Fourways Boulevard on Thursday night, which persisted into Friday morning.Three lanes on the M1 North were closed after a tree fell on the highway in Klipspruit on Friday.The rainy weather over Gauteng is expected to ease over the weekend.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/high-rainfall-causes-graves-to-collapse-at-joburg-cemetery-20180323
