The managers of the salon are looking for anyone who could help with the funeral.“We want to give him a dignified send off. Whoever wants to help must please contact us ,” said his boss, Pearl Forbes.His colleague, Aubrey Forbes, said: “He used to talk to me about everything but he never told me anything was bothering him.”She said Patrick was happy before he died.“He came to work on Sunday and left early. He kept the keys because he came in early. We wondered why he hadn’t opened the salon on Monday morning when we got here. “We were extremely shocked to hear he was found hanged,” she said.
