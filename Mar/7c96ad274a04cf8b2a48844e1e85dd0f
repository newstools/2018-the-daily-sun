Another patient (44) said when he asked the nurse in charge why they had to wait so long, he was told there were only two doctors working at the hospital. “This is not fair,” he said. “We want the KZN Health Department to intervene urgently.” KZN health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said: “The shortage of doctors is a global phenomenon not unique to South Africa or this province. “It is felt more in rural areas, as doctors tend to choose to work in cities or the private sector. “The government always tries its best to keep this scarce human resource, but it is not always successful,” she said. Wentworth Hospital was in the process of recruiting new doctors to start next month.
