We should be concerned about how we heal the genocide of the past.“The land issue is not an election or political issue but an emotional one. “Whites are angry and that makes me happy.“They have called us names, but we have not beaten them up. We tell the truth openly and if it hurts you, it’s your baby,” he said. Turning to the subject of Nelson Mandela Bay’s mayor Athol Trollip, Malema said the only way to punish the DA was to target the white mayor. He said since they had spoken out about Trollip, the DA had kept on insulting them and pushing them away. Malema was also quick to state that the EFF was not at war with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini or other traditional leaders over land. “Let us not beat the war drums. We love the Zulu king, but we have a right to disagree with him. The king must be respected.“I fear no one but God. Let there be a peaceful meeting.”He complained about President Cyril Ramaphosa taking his time to deal with the Guptas, and said the same fate as that dealt out to former president Jacob Zuma awaited the new president if he kept up his pace.The youth were urged to swell registration stations this weekend to register to vote.
