The Pinetown Regional court in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday handed down an 18-year prison sentence to a 26-year-old man found guilty of raping his mentally challenged neighbour in 2016. Snothando Mhlongo threatened to kill his neighbour if she told anyone that he had raped her at his house in Berkshire Downs, New Germany. Despite this, the survivor opened a case of rape at the Pinetown police station. During an investigation by the Pinetown Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit it was revealed that Mhlongo had raped the woman on several other occasions. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstnbk3d0oVIpx_SNJdd_DmXY1BCl7ZcM2esKib652EI36rJdcXkMiFgkSaVq40VHX2vlJlK4AsQFnAMQxb76TFj209_amBfiXzNkPvPjF5ePDkZjAhp6MM9GH_9EDUrR4VV2hEMRH3-7whyVYcvyI4rcarMRVJ63ewZeN7inVzX5e0NpX9RYzu0LKrr5o3Jr7T-bAP--gOx56xyd58n1JjL0P4rQYHETVKK1n7Kqwh5ARbboDyBfsUOozh6CmP2aQGx7R_lWaU2VpOY0L78fH8Xugf3Vig\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJXwr_MiCE8SEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
