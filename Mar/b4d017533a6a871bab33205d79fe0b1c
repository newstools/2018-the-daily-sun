CAPE TOWN CITY coach, Benni McCarthy, has lambasted South African football club owners for snubbing local young coaches.This has been one of the main topics in South African football where clubs opt for foreign coaches instead of promoting former players, who are keen on venturing into professional coaching.Some succeeded and others failed to prove their mettle.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuM8wFCLukCmPB-KfUJJRzW8J2DRUeBm89ZpN7f4uM83NqzgG1t8_zXx4XN-O4VD8SNqFKe-ca4y9el6FCGjkZ1oiT7m3QslgFjFnnsFT3S-gjpcUXVbPi1BeS2OU_2b4ZFezdPUWd1XEZLmtgkEQG10xz4ufU_cVqsn3tfWadR_6NfxguLn5pWRx94RVAh12BshgoLwkG5FEzDbCIssyvgB1NGhaTXhfsdXEVtCs2eV2sDmp8vJzwQ5q7jeDASxxCh2bGZ3DJiZ18ciOT5pCIZcQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP9m3jbLd3NREAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But they don’t trust us to think that we can go out there and do it. They prefer the merry-go-round of coaches. “It takes a lot of courage for a guy to take the risk. Prior to that, you saw the likes of Shaun Bartlett who tried and failed, but now people don’t want to take a chance any more.”McCarthy also made an example of Maritzburg United coach Fadlu Davids, who is now a success with Farouk Kadodia’s side and Pitso Mosimane, who is a success story with Mamelodi Sundowns.Said McCarthy: “Fadlu has been there. Chairmen take coaches with experience. This is my first time ever in the hot seat, so a lot of  mistakes can be expected from me,”  said the all-time Bafana Bafana goal-scorer.“We’re still in the top eight and that’s not a bad start for a local young coach. I’m learning and it’ll get better.”
