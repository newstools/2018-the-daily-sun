BAROKA FC head coach McDonald Makhubedu says he expects a tough challenge when his charges take on Kaizer Chiefs in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals.Last season Makhubedu was left unimpressed by Chiefs’ display when they eliminated his side at the time, Acornbush FC, 2-1 in the quarterfinals of the same competition. He claimed after their encounter that the Soweto giants had nothing to teach his young charges in the ABC Motsepe League team. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssSWnk5b4ea_cUr1YkI0AQGiXGuffYZpawBRaDodJdr0J7jxnk-Cl3CNwD53j1rBEaxXpKamLPhVKdffxPRR-ffgMsGxyvRuf2jqeO0j19kppwE7Rr7EkIEWA6DvCbkKlMWB0FcehfCfO27JiYAraOzWGutjHOsdDgkH4XaDO22q1xqMZ4QQK6R7ayacchAWenyM-Xqsmg2IQn1_It6JKbxMMjeeCV_LVhjoENwp3SWoiQBL02N3vy-eAnXReE281z9WV0rKoC81nPdVwrT\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNUL-G5XycGEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Having seen Baroka eliminate Chiefs at the same stage of the tournament in 2011, when they were given the “giant-killers” name tag, Makhubedu insists the result counts for nothing right now, as a lot has changed. “When match day comes history will count for nothing because it won’t help us get the result. It would be good if we did not rely on that at all. “Chiefs are a big team, we respect them and everyone knows when it comes to cup competitions they do well,” added Makhubedu.
