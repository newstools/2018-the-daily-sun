Kim Kardashian West is a fashion and beauty icon, and a huge trend setter for the modern girl. Last year Kim Kardashian started rocking a straight structured mid length bob and girls all over have followed in her footsteps. Bob hairstyles are very versatile, but to achieve the Kim K inspired bob, go for straight hair, mid length and a middle parting. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>See pictures below of the Kim K inspired bob: Repost from @itsmiddy ??Thinking I wanna go back to this ??
