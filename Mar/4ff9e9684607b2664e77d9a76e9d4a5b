Then one day he got a call from Joyce Mthimunye.As soon as he heard the 42-year-old’s voice, he knew his prayers had been answered.He introduced her to the SunTeam over the weekend.“Of all the women I spoke to, I fell in love with her the minute I answered her call,” he said.He said Joyce didn’t have bad intentions and wouldn’t waste his time.“We’ll get married soon because that is what we both want,” said Albert.Joyce from Mabopane said she saw Albert’s story on Daily Sun’s website.“I checked his Facebook profile and everything about him indicated he was the man for me,” she said.Joyce has been single for seven years.“I got out of a bad relationship and lost all hope until I saw Albert.”The two have already spent weekends together and Joyce has been introduced to Albert’s children, who said they’d love to spend their lives with her.Albert said: “I am now officially off the market. I hope I will stop receiving messages and pictures from women.”
