Cape Town collective water use has gone up again to an average of 565ML a day after the City quietly moved Day Zero to 2019."Unfortunately, usage has increased by 54 million litres per day from last week's record low of 511 million litres per day," said Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson in a statement on Tuesday.Water usage will continue to be monitored, with Level 6B restrictions still in place, but the City still has to slash its consumption to 450Ml litres per day in order to stretch the available water supplies through the rest of the year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstzFWzxMSo2PaFs4AThTKeavFIq0mE668h1bYFI8yymGlbp1UYBpu6k7a7Yqz5WkyhlUxhhoQ4MTCxpEPUiTFcnlCBCEXXRO0SfLfxQyZIhggTK1dJNNB7hprY2z2YgjIZ-3MWZ0LKsVjjPNJDSzu5K8YiPr9k3YDfgbZ-5AI63StqOY1tkTapTPMDi-maaSy1dYurdnpXI5uA8DrM2KeIl7RXYXWLeFyP3pAVw_D_BKrrTNhJdZv_GajkGpCvibW9HtSrrk-O_8cPdPxYwE_V9TcxWOUk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNgb1j9phwZXEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
