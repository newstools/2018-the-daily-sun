BAFANA Bafana coach Stuart Baxter has expressed his disappointment over the missed opportunity to take part in an international tournament in Thailand. Last month, Safa turned down an invitation from the Football Association of Thailand to play in the annual King’s Cup. Safa was hoping to secure clashes with higher profile teams than the participating nations of Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Gabon and Slovakia, however.But now Bafana will have to settle for a one-day, three nations tournament featuring Zambia and Zimbabwe on the Fifa-sanctioned weekend of 24 March. The mini-tournament will take place in Lusaka. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvFjbiwlI346FY77cpIA35oRGAf4uou6rPWicUDBa1N2bNjrtN-4pmecRsJS9zMv_p2BOWobo4q5YH0N7tmvDIGVnuPqbqzhauaC_C3e2OYJmsxusuFvHeS6AKdFm_NmUeQWCFU4SHjxi15DyQzcpg0M648fyppKbYMLh_Z_SF1RsTA6zl3SPi6Fev8D-a9DVidH0wHNxGZDZ3NsCqaLNViIT8A1dvuGT5SkCqEtcyISX6tQwM1GMFoMkC82oc5ZYpYgeS4gEdzHwDxNI0b\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKIM7ScmZ-86EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We were set to go to Thailand. But after a long and winding road, I have only just found where we are going. So Safa House has some weeding out to do as well.” He added: “I believe that with the games coming up, we have to make sure that we do two things this year – tidy up the garden because there are plenty of weeds, such as our relationships with the PSL and the clubs. And relationships with the players and the media are also vital.”“As we move forward,” added Baxter, “the only thing we need to make sure we do is qualify for the 2019 Afcon (Africa Cup of Nations) in Cameroon. We have to commit to getting our young players to gel with the experienced ones. “We want players who will be committed to the shirt, not come to the camp to party. We want players who want to improve.” The former Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United coach says there’s so much good talent in this country that he did not understand “the way we keep knocking ourselves over, or the way we treat our young players”. Explained Baxter: “We have to go to Afcon because those young players need the experience of a major tournament. “I believe this is a very passionate nation with such a rich history in politics, sport and culture. Let us empower the young players and give them the basics to grow. Let’s express ourselves in our own unique ways and take SA football to the World Cup!”    Like this story?
