This has led to train delays and cancellations,” she said. The deputy minister visited the Khayelitsha, Langa, Bonteheuwel and Cape Town train stations to interact with commuters and learn more about the hardships they face.She urged commuters to play a role in ensuring that trains are kept safe by reporting any suspicious activity. Residents complained that there was no alternative transport when trains were cancelled or suspended. Sonwabo Mathibe (44) said: “We used to catch buses when the trains were cancelled but this wasn’t possible for a period of five weeks. Metrorail didn’t communicate with us.”A pupil who travels from Nyanga to Cape Town every day said: “I always catch the earliest train at 5am to be at school on time but it’s dangerous to walk so early.”The central line was suspended after a security guard was killed at Chris Hani Station in Khayelitsha Metrorail regional manager for Cape Town, Richard Walker was recently suspended, which sources believe was linked to operational failures.
