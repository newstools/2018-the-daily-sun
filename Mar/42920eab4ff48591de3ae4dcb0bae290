They will debate a motion of no confidence and reinstitute the position of deputy mayor. Former deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani of the UDM was ousted at a council meeting in August. The position has remained vacant since then.African Independent Congress Councillor Tshono Buyeye claimed Lawack displayed favouritism towards the DA at the expense of other opposition parties.EFF Councillor Zilindile Vena accused Trollip of failing to prioritise the poor and accused him of redirecting money aimed at tarring roads towards the 40km stretch of road used for the Ironman race.Malema said his party would vote against Trollip if the ANC put forward a credible leader such as former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas.
