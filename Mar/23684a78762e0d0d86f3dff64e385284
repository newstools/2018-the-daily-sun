THE Portfolio Committee on Social Development will be
briefed by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) on the
implementation of the Constitutional Court judgement.Sassa has admitted that there's no contingency plan to
manage the cash component of the social grants system if the Constitutional
Court denies an extension of the invalid CPS contract.Acting Sassa CEO Pearl Bhengu said it was only work in
progress.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuif8rzMlzmJcv6NvvLInnqatVqgWqGuf8oHpZl-Dq8lajE7CNznU_Mn1DgshAT-UjHgQMMMY7ymsGPorwF2pfai-Gm0TzHE1pIp2BsbN0i5z9RSIY8349TjRj7y8af946W0RVrhMwPMwGVh1WNKVnrN9d-EdAED57CgTZeRxQgQlAr4PVqdA5L1ErK33EgXOQDzlJTzeUOk1G2hN7GQXbNZUA0KbRywQWdx7LpernBQliy0w8_cNWHFSOscHfO17qPheD6IPtSlK0KmCc50oM2WnOAph4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMpOlLIKh3PhEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

and the South African Post Office (SAPO) clarify the contingency measures, put
in place to deal with the payment of social grants.This, after Bhengu told journalists last Thursday of a
potential plan to assist with cash payments, were the court to rule against
extending the contract of current invalid service provider CPS.The plan however, would be "very inconvenient",
she admitted.The court was unhappy that Sassa had told it days earlier
that there was no contingency plan on paper.In court papers filed on Monday, Bhengu clarified her
response to the media, saying there was still no "feasible"
contingency plan that will guarantee cash payments on April 1.The purpose of the press briefing was to show that Sassa was
ready to pay the grants of roughly 70% of beneficiaries, but needed assistance
with cash payments for the rest.SOURCE: NEWS24
