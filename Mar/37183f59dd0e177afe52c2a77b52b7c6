BLACK Leopards’ experience will play a vital role in ensuring that the Venda based outfit secures a play-offs spot at the end of the National First Division season.This was the view of Lidoda Duvha mentor Joel Masutha, who has transformed them after they struggled at the beginning of the season. Leopards have changed coaches three times this season but Masutha, who took over early in December last year, seems to be the perfect fit. Players understand him well and this has seen Leopards move up from 11th to second place in the table. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuk2GlvJNdF6cgeDO1sfeHVZfs5dr98VbCNQtKoKZ8dijmN4Gy1flUgX22UiZfxWvHtz0T1Q5xy34lqWaxOFhoeZbCny5PAjer9ty7F7WocRBhnN2vtVv3skfHyZrYzrH-vty8oOc9GnwZ7fV11DPtkZtQPGWc3zlMzZpE0SHBSD3j-OFBoY2rhQtAhPTvAuMc84oPxIhXo9P60DxwrUMxicyVU4f1EmcKAUcUE_Awi25R6MGho0kvzpmDgPvk-KXzqjuONySibPqLw1EQlOIdi7g\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YTlBwbsN_yYIaL69MFPgyTo1yA8g4Dz7CO054n2T2UL7Mqbvs_yWrq5ATAAkk_5n1U8_yJhUlQ0ooOXO6xHF6WWMXsMMxsf3FMTOe1J\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzF7CdMYhVFjLEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Leopards are now among six highly likely contenders for two of the top three spots this season – as Highlands Park are just about home and dry with automatic promotion. The teams that finish second and third get another chance of fighting for a PSL spot, joining the Absa Premiership club that finished in 15th place in the mini-league play-offs.Masutha says Leopards players understand the importance of getting to the play-offs and winning them, having been part of the play-offs three times in four seasons now.Leopards have 38 points, equal with Real Kings. They are two points ahead of fourth placed Jomo Cosmos and fifth-placed newbies Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila. Said Masutha: “Players and the technical team understand each other and have one vision – a return to the PSL. There are no miracles. Highlands have won the league, now we need to hustle for second spot, which is the one we have.”“Not taking anything away from the other teams, but we and Cosmos stand the best chance because of experience. We have been in this position before, we know what it takes to make the play-offs.” His view is not far-fetched: Kings and Tshakhuma were in second and third spot respectively for a while but their youthful squads seem to be cracking under pressure as the competition gets tougher each weekend.Masutha said consistency would be key now. “One mistake and you are out of the race. We will need to stay grounded and not take any of our opponents lightly,” said the coach.
