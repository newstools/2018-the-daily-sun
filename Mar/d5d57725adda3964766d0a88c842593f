But up to now, the municipalityhas not paid us a cent,” said Thulani.“We met as a family and decided to lock the toilets until we are paid what is owed to us.”Thulani added that residents should blame the municipality and not them.Municipal spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa confirmed that the family owned the land.“They signed a Permission To Occupy with the municipality.“Before the erection of ablution facilities, the land owner was consulted by the municipal officials and everything was signed and sealed,” said Tozi.When asked about the non-payment allegations, Tozi did not respond. She also failed to say which steps they plan to take to rectify the situation.
