All we can hope is that it happens soon. “When that happens we will find peace.”Palesa was a 21-year-old student at the University of Joburg when she went missing in August 2013 while visiting a friend in Phiri, Soweto.Her skeletal remains were discovered in a shallow grave at the same house three years later, on 16 December 2016, after police received an anonymous tip-off.Because of the condition of the remains, her identity had to be confirmed by DNA testing.Palesa’s uncle said that the investigating officer in the case has been keeping them informed about developments but there hasn’t been much progress.Morena said her death left a big gap in the family.“She was such a loving person. She brought a bright light to our family.“Her younger siblings could have learnt a lot from her,” said Morena.He said they hope that one day the person or the people who did this will confess.“We have accepted that she has died and there is nothing we can do to bring her back, but seeing somebody being arrested will make the tragedy a little easier for us to bear.”Brigadier Mmathepelo Peterson of the Gauteng police said : “I confirm the consistent engagements between the police and the office of the director of public prosecution.”Initially there was confusion about the docket but this was clarified by Brigadier Peterson.“The docket is not necessarily physically with the office of the director of public prosecution,” he said.“I also wish to reiterate that this is a sensitive case and we prefer not to comment further on the investigation at this point.”
