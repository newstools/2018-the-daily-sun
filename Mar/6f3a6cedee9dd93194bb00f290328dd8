We also want young coaches to be empowered.”Mokwena has played a huge role in Pirates since he arrived at the beginning of the campaign and he has often been praised by his head coach, Milutin Sredojevic, as well as the players which could be something that has seemingly caught the eye of Baxter.  Bafana’s first game, on March 22nd, will be against Angola, before facing either Zambia or Zimbabwe a few days later on the 25th.
