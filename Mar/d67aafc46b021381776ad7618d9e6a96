all in the public interest, and to set a date when they could call both the
department and Gigaba to Parliament."It will give the public at large the comfort that we have
dealt with it, and we then decide how we take the matter forward," he
proposed."All of us in the committee have a responsibility to hold the
officials accountable for that."What they wanted to know was whether or not there was any
impropriety in granting the family early citizenship, and if so, who granted
it, he said."Only the minister can answer that," he added.ANC MPs support proposalThe ANC caucus seemed to finally have reached firm consensus on
the issue. ANC MP Maesela Kekana declared it was time to deal with the issue
decisively."Having read the documents, I'm convinced there is a case to
answer. Without a waste of time, this matter is of public interest. We are here
as public representatives to work for the people who put us here," he
said."We are not here as praise singers, we are here to make sure
we play our role as Members of Parliament."ANC MP Dineo Raphuti agreed with her colleague, but not before
"raising her concerns" about the whistleblower who made the
information public."Did this whistleblower goes through someone's emails? Is it
for personal gain? We need to look at... here is someone who got a hold of
emails," she mused.But she supported the inquiry, she eventually said.SOURCE: NEWS24
