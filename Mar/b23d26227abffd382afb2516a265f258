Yeah I beat Gatlin.” It was a great night for SA athletes as golden girl Caster Semenya also lived up to expectations as she smashed a 34-year-old 1000m record to clock 2:35:44 to receive a standing ovation. She said she would do it and she certainly did it style. Semenya smashed Iize de Kock’s record of 2:37:20 set in 1983. The jubilant crowd got their money’s worth and traffic was at a stand still in the capital as hundreds of athletics enthusiasts made their way to the University of Pretoria.Mzansi’s big name stars mixed with top athletes from around the world in front of the sold-out crowd. Ten countries with a big athletics culture such as USA, Botswana and Kenya took part. SA golden boy and Olympic record holder Wayde van Niekerk, who is recovering from a knee injury watched from the stands. Antonio Alkana announced his start to the season like a house on fire when he ran like a knife through butter the men’s 110m hurdles when he clocked 13.63 seconds to get the show of the stars off to a thrilling start. Alkana, who has just recovered from injury in January, was happy with his time. The 27-year-old lost his mother in a tragic accident recently and he dedicated his win to her. Van Niekerk, who was cheering for his friends Semenya and Akani Simbine, said he enjoys spending time with his wife and taking his time off the track events. He warned that he will come back stronger and more determined to dominate on the world stage. Van Niekerk said: “My rehabilitation is going well. I’m slowly getting there.” Wenda Nel showed her class winning the women’s 400m hurdles with the time of 55.34 sec. Isaac Makwala of Botswana run a fast time of 31.80 to win the men’s 300m, and Simbine clocked an impressive 10.07 in his first race of the year in the men’s 100m final.
