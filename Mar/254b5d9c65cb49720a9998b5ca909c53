Parents complained about dirt all over the school, broken toilet doors and windows and dangerous electrical wiring. According to parents, most pupils are forced to carry their own water to school and use nearby toilets. A concerned parent, Lilian Ntuli, told the People’s Paper that as parents they have been complaining about poor conditions at the school for the past two years, but their complaints fell on deaf ears. “The school has only one working tap for about 1 200 pupils. The school’s management still expects us to pay school fees while our children come with their own water and do not even use these dirty toilets. “We want the department to intervene as this school is worse than a dump site, we can’t fold our hands while our kids learn in this bad environment,” said Lilian. Another parent, Mookodi Kgaogelo, said they were worried about how their children were going to get proper education when the school was not safe. “We’re sick and tired of the principal. When she first came here in 2015 she said the R350 school fee we used to pay wasn’t enough for the running of the school. We then agreed to pay R500.  “Two years later, and she wants the fees to increase to a whooping R850, but we see no improvement and even the district wasn’t aware of the fee increment,” said Mookodi. Steve Mabona of the Gauteng Department of Education said they have sent their representatives to meet with the parents. “A steering committee has been formed to look into the matter.  “We can confirm that schooling was disrupted by some parents recently. It’s unfortunate that parents became disruptive. “We’ll continue engaging with the parents and persuade them not to disrupt classes while attending to their concerns,” Mabona said.
