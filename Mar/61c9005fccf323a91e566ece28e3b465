When the SunTeam spoke to the woman shortly after the incident, she said the doctor claimed that he needed to put a pill into her punani, but he then penetrated her. The doctor, who also runs his own surgery, was arrested and is currently out on bail. The residents handed a memorandum to the hospital’s management. They gave the hospital seven days to respond to their concerns or they would shut it down.They demanded that the hospital get rid of all foreign staff who had accused the doctor of rape. Resident Beauty Tlholoe said: “We feel the doctor was framed and we are going to fight. “I have known the doctor all my life. He was a teacher before he studied medicine.”Community representative Lesego Seleke said the doctor was a good man who never turned away patients. “He is a kind man.”The hospital has confirmed receiving the memorandum.
