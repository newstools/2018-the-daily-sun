GOGO Morongwa Phala’s wish was to spend the final days of her life enjoying the sun and fresh air while moving around her house doing household chores.Tragically, the 91-year-old gogo from Ga-Molema Village in Bochum, Limpopo, has been trapped in bed and unable to move for 15 long years. She has been bedridden ever since 2003. On top of her woes, she has lost her sight.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstG3EDXxmcwNMMK854HVwia6yuBRI8dGX9M_FNBx8dwqqdxYIUmkSVEGecMu_m9kVqDiD8S_mQFXDaTwSHn8W4XGaHh8WZB8sQju-Xxi3OQjMQR4O-04DocYzWS5g0n4WhMBcAvIQJWrH3Nd9_Ifb-M4GhMT525LZhmKm9gCbZy_Np497PPYtj2DfE2za281vBt01r1O_EGuWShLeLrLKMQL0AglMSJqMEXnxaEWUCC_eyILDhsa87MZ_YtxOYV8aoZlh097N8tcOO9-vC4JQVpSx3i3sE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBFDwJyXkl5MEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

All I want now is to get a decent wheelchair but I’m not winning,” said the weeping gogo.However, the gogo wept tears of joy moments later when EFF members dropped by carrying a new wheelchair and groceries.“All our worries are gone now. Even though I’m blind, I will now be able to move around my house and yard. My biggest challenge was going to the toilet. But that’s history and my prayers have been answered.“I never thought I’d live to see this day. I have been suffering for 15 years without anyone taking any notice,” she saidThe gogo lives with her six grandkids and her daughter Mokgaetsi (60), who has been taking care of her since 2003.The family exists solely on social grants.“We want to thank the EFF for their help. Life will be much easier for us. They must continue to help the needy,” said Mokgaetsi.The party’s Councillor Dinah Mohlabeng said after they heard of gogo Morongwa’s plight, they acted immediately.“Our mandate is to help the needy. We hope this brings about peace of mind in her life. She should know that we care.”
