He said some are still in the country and six have been rearrested. “The six had no intention of leaving South Africa. Their corrupt release meant they wouldn’t need to report to their countries’ authorities and would continue with their smuggling activities.” The investigation revealed that Mzansi officials were paid in cash or into their bank accounts from the parolees’ families or friends.
