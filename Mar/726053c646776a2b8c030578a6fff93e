Local rapper Nasty C is a #StyleCrush for his old school, vintage style. Nasty C, whose real name is David Junior Ngcobo is one of the most popular rappers in the country, so it's critical that he has to look good. You can see that "image" is very important to the rapper, as his unique style really sets him apart from the rest. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>He has a typical hip hop rapper flair to him but mixes an old school twist to his style. From his own "Fresh Prince" hairstyle, to always wearing sneakers, gold chains and tracksuits. He also loves bold prints and colours, which show that he's not afraid to play around with fashion. See pictures below of Nasty C's fabulous style: in studio working on “Ivyson”A post shared by  In Studio Working On Album (@nasty_csa) on Dec 17, 2017 at 6:33pm PSTA post shared by In Studio Working On Album (@nasty_csa) on Jan 31, 2018 at 1:07am PSTI’m turning 21 in 3 days, then it’ll be okay for the aunties to crush on me openlyA post shared by  In Studio Working On Album (@nasty_csa) on Feb 7, 2018 at 9:22pm PSTMen Aren’t Trash, they just sometimes take pictures next to it ????‍??A post shared by  In Studio Working On Album (@nasty_csa) on Feb 9, 2018 at 2:19am PSTI’m in Cape Town!! ..
