Our biggest challenge = job creation. A thought: let every household employ just 1 more cleaning lady or gardener. Just 1. I know it’s a financial sacrifice. But we all need to sacrifice if we are to save SA. Imagine the impact.”The tweet did not go down well with Black Twitter.Almost immediately, she was slammed for her tweet.After being hammered by Twitter users, she initially retracted her statement.“I withdraw the comment. I thought it was a practical solution to a short term serious problem of people living on social grants (particularly women who live on child grants of R400 pm per child). I apologize if I offended anyone,” she said.“I don’t think your apology is sincere, yours was one of the most racist comments from a privileged white that I had ever seen, perpetuate the master-servant relationship between Afrikans &settler colonialists,” @ForexTraderSibo said.“I do recognise that my tweet was inappropriate in many respects and in the context of SA’s history,” she said. Magda also said that she would donate R200 000 to an organisation that approaches her with a real job creation scheme for people.
