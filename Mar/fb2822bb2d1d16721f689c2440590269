My salary was under my bed and I lost it all.” The boy’s mum was too upset to speak, but his sister (32) said he died from smoke inhalation. “There was a big bang when the power was restored,” she said. “He was the first person to wake up and run to the kitchen.“When I took my 11-month-old baby, I saw my brother lying in the kitchen. I called out his name but he didn’t respond.” Community leader Mwezi Lugwayi said the tragedy could have been avoided if the area had electricity. “The company hired to electrify the area is finalising things so they can start working some time this month. The sooner they start, the better.” Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services spokesman Theo Layne said 100 people were left homeless. He said: “One minor sustained fatal burns. “The case was handed over to the police.”
