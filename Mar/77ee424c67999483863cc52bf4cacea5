A solution was reached and accepted by Molamodi’s family and his wife.The question of who had the right to bury Molamodi would have been heard in the Limpopo High Court yesterday.Limpopo government spokesman, Phuti Seloba, said they were glad that the parties came to an agreement.Both parties have agreed that Molamodi’s body will arrive at the house where he was living with his wife at Ga-Thoka Village on this morning.His body will later be transferred to his mother’s house in Ga-Makanye for a prayer before departing for the cemetery, which is what his wife wanted.
