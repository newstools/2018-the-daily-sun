They demanded that he leave the school premises permanently. The father of the pupils said his children had been constantly victimised by the principal for the past two years. “My children went through hard times at the hands of the people who were supposed to protect them. They would come home crying. They said the teachers called them demons and said they would spread their demonic behaviour to other kids,” said the father. He said on several occasions he had tried, in vain, to get the matter sorted out with the principal.“My children were being called names like witches and demons in front of other pupils. “When I confronted the principal, he told me to take my children out of the school because they were evil. He said my entire family needed prayers,” said the father. Cops were called in to rescue the principal and he left unharmed. Kagiso police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya confirmed that the principal was rescued by the police. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said the department was aware of the incident and was concerned about it.It was clearly explained to the family that there are processes that will be followed to deal with departmental officials.Mabona said the teachers will report to the district offices while the problem is being resolved.The five pupils were advised to report back to school.District officials will be stationed at the school to restore normality to everyday teaching.“The district has launched an investigation and the necessary action will be taken against any wrong done by officials.“The school or officials are not allowed to promote any religion or discriminate against pupils. That will never be tolerated in our environment,” said Mabona.
