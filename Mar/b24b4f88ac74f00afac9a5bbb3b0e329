Bishop Isaac Malaza (51) of Jerusalem Ekuphumuleni Church at Ezakheni in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga led the call for holy help. The bishop, who started the prayer sessions in 1999, said God spoke to him in a dream and commanded him to pray on the deadly road to save buses, taxis, motorists and pedestrians. “When we started, there were still a lot of accidents happening but since our prayer intervention the number has reduced over the years,” he said.Kgomotso Bessie (32), an accident victim, told Daily Sun she was hit by a motorbike on the deadly road in May last year.“I was on the pavement when a biker lost control and hit me. My leg was broken and I was in hospital for four days.” CPF deputy chairman Mannie Entries said the prayers raised awareness about road deaths.Paulos Mahlangu from the department of co-operative governance said he hoped the prayers would help save lives.Captain Agnes Masilela of the Tshwane Eastpolice said: “Since we intervened with prayers, the number of deaths and accidents have definitely been reduced.”
