I posted a pic of me having a beer and got a lot of negative response. Surely in 2018 women can choose their own drinks? What are your thoughts? #holdmybeer #internationalwomensday,” she said.After such a long day making magic, a cold beer is all that's needed to unwind. #HoldMyBeer pic.twitter.com/kxSj6rJnh2— Dineo Ranaka (@dineoranaka) March 7, 2018
