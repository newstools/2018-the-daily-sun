Poverty can become a thing of the past,” he said.He said if one person in the family is educated, graduating becomes a family thing. Zola 7 partnered with the institution in a campaign to search for students in need of bursaries.Hopefuls from all over the country sent motivational letters and explained why they should be given bursaries.After the assessment, only the top three motivational letters belonging to Kent van Eden (29), Jeffrey Monyane (24) and Mahlatse Nkgudi (25) were chosen.The bursaries were officially handed over on the day.“We’re more than grateful for this opportunity. We won’t play with it,” said Kent. Zola told Daily Sun the response they received during the campaign showed young people in Mzansi were keen to study.Tameez Chothia, the institution’s marketing and public relations manager, said their academy focused on skills development in the construction sector. She said once students graduate, they place them in jobs.
