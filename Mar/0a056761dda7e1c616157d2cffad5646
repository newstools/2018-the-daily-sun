It shows the taxi driving past a car parked on the side of the road and heading straight for the invisible bridge. The taxi is seen moving a short distance before it loses control and slips into the overflowing river and is swept away by the current. The taxi driver and some of the passengers are seen jumping out of the taxi and moving to the banks. However, some of the passengers were not able to swim across and were swept away. Lesotho police said the taxi was ferrying 15 passengers and that the search for the missing passengers was being hampered by heavy rain.
