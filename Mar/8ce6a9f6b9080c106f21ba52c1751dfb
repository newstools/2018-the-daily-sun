That is when I got interested,” he said.The madala started to collect wood and turn it into art. “Wood carving is not easy. It is a particular art form that needs a special skill and talent. “My work includes frames and wall decorations. “I’m mostly inspired by nature,” he told Daily Sun.Many people stop at his house to admire his work. Some of them ask him to sell particular works to them. Most of Mabidikama’s art takes the form of animals, hunters, ocean storms, water rescues and fishermen.His work is produced from slabs of wood such as poplar, oak and pine. “I plan to find a place where I can show people my work and exhibit it.”He said the exhibition will show a range of art with the prices he needs for them.Mabidikama said he was grateful to have such a talent. Carving takes time but nevertheless it’s something he has come to enjoy very much, as well as make his living from.
