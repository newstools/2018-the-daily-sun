The decision to postpone the elections can be only be taken by the Safa Congress. “It is unfortunate that the IEC can make such a decision based on one individual.“The Safa Congress will appoint a new electoral committee,” said Chimhavi.“The call for Dr Jordaan to resign is nonsensical. He was elected by Safa regions and they are the only people who can make him resign.”
