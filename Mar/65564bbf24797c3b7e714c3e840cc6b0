WHEN you mention legalising medical dagga, people think it would lead to more teens smoking it and to people overdosing on pain medication.But according to new research, neither theory has been proved. Since medical dagga first became legal in California in the US in 1996, it’s been legalised across more than half of that country.But published studies found this had almost no impact on dagga use among teens.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The results of both studies are published online in the Addiction journal.In South Africa, a state legal team has brought the Western Cape High Court’s decision to legalise private use of dagga to the Constitutional Court to be reversed.The State asked the Constitutional Court to rule in favour of returning the case to the High Court. The Constitutional Court has reserved judgment and says it will make a ruling soon.“Several years ago, before the group of papers we analysed were published, people thought US medical dagga laws would increase teen consumption by sending the message that it was safe and acceptable to use,” said Columbia University professor Deborah Hasin.American, Australian and British researchers found little to show that increased access to medical dagga as an alternative way to manage pain has led to a drop in deaths from abuse of pain medication.Author Wayne Hall, a professor with the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland in Australia, said research suggesting any link between the two is weak. Hall warnd it is too early to suggest that access to medical dagga is increased as a policy to reduce pain medication overdose risks.But he said, despite the research findings, legalising medical dagga is not without its consequences. “While not every user suffers harm, using it risks withdrawal, addiction and increased chances of vehicle crashes,” he said. – HEALTH24
