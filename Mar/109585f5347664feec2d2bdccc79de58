HUNDREDS of workers protested outside a meat processing plant on Friday.They demanded that the health department show them the results of the inspection done by its officials last month. This came after the Best Grade Factory in Empangeni, northern KZN, suspended work on Thursday. The factory was closed down in response to the department’s announcement last week that the deadly Listeriosis outbreak had been linked to cold meat products. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsspgr0AnSN4SVGdvyxcVm5tZeZaZgHTOVXkpc90GvxsXDNx3Zkt4WrTdoPDZ1wPFFGNG63hyvFwEJO3EMIJxu7CCs05HyfejuRDqRMGf-CNo6NlNjyfp6aY7ebOUWQn0O3QckYOrm9A-mVb2m-UcUPo-FFs9MQXFFh26nypYKlXwB8MxbGt4AVztoYS9Uckj01s1l-Y64Kkw-kKSlsAg3CspMM0kyfLAdK2mAzX4ZHinpr3pvIMx8DMdqBRJcy2LqpDIYywaLohYjmPapGnoMwNreITcnI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHNy7kiUw5j9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Bheki Shabane, provincial secretary of the United Chemical Industries Mining Electrical State Health and Aligned Workers Union, said the department was taking too long to give them feedback. When the SunTeam contacted factory managing director Nkululeko Luthuli, he said he was busy on another call and would be available in 30 minutes. But he failed to answer when the SunTeam called back. In a letter he gave to workers he said: “Due to the backlog at state laboratories, our results have not been returned. As a result, we have to conduct private testing of our products to ensure safety.”When asked about the delay, KZN Health spokeswoman Samke Khumalo referred the SunTeam to the department’s website. However, the information was not online.
