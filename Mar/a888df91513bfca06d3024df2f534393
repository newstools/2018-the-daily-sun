They currently occupy third spot in the Absa Premiership table instead of their norm of fighting relegation. Eymael stressed the importance of continuing to keep their foot on the pedal.He said: “Anything can happen in a cup game, and there is no second chance because it’s a direct elimination. Chippa have a new coach and that will motivate their players. “But it’s important for us to reach the quarterfinals.”Eymael revealed that he is not scared to deal with any type of missiles that Heric may have in his arsenal.“We can play different tactics. We can change from 4-2-3-1 to 4-2-2-2, 3-5-2 or 4-3-3, but it’s not the tactics that make a difference, it is the animation that wins games. How you move on the pitch is important. I am happy that we don’t have any injuries.”Eymael reckons going further in the competition would help his side achieve their target of finishing the season in the top eight.“We need only five points to finish in the top eight – the points we collect after that will determine where we end up on the table.”
