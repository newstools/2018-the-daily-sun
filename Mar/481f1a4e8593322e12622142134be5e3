have lost a mother who was pregnant, and her daughter. We have reported the
case to police.” Keki said death at the hands of izinyoka was common in
the area. “It’s unfortunate that wrong people in society illegally
and dangerously tap electricity but it’s innocent people who pay the price,” Keki
was quoted in the report as saying.Heartbroken husband and dad, Mutwalibi Mboizi said: “They
have caused the death of my beloved family members but I can do nothing.” The Elgon region cop spokesman, Suwed Manshur said: “We
want to know the person who tapped that power illegally.” The bodies have been taken to a local hospital for a
post-mortem.
