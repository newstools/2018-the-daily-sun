My children have no clothes to wear to school,” she said. The jobless, broke Wendy is now faced with the difficult task of rebuilding her shack. “I’ll have to take my children to their gogo, who has a small room. I don’t know where to start.” Zanele Mbonambi (52) said people tried to put out the blaze, but it was too strong. She said when firefighters arrived at the scene, it was too late to save anything. “I’m glad no one was injured. We just need more people to help us rebuild our shacks and make our lives better. “Most of the residents here are unemployed and it will be hard for us to get back on our feet.” Joburg Emergency Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said there were no injuries or deaths, but people were treated for smoke inhalation.He said Joburg Disaster Management and relief stakeholders helped the affected people with food parcels and blankets.Mulaudzi warned residents of the dangers of leaving paraffin stoves and candles unattended.
