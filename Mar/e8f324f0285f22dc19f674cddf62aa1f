AMAZULU striker Rhulani Manzini’s frustrations at being on the sideline seem to have reached boiling point.SunSport has reliably learnt that Manzini allegedly had a bust-up with Usuthu coach Cavin Johnson during training.According to sources close to the club, the 30-year-old could soon find himself out of the AmaZulu household, as he doesn’t see eye to eye with Johnson.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvTeYJrwFhIZu6FK8k07XwuQdeGW0RYKWmD2cK3VnBYjFzVzi9SX2yG4CNz9I080yE44A3waeOtGa6dATO3QqvNEV1MQJGi8eZFNx9lTgAwEzpXymTSpyahyWLlZP6vjiNvGGkJjrSFHvo0cNqpHxa4AIzanp7el-6mLK6vHT9wldAD4Rel9QYAE54dnNXMOsbrCmqYuSvkXYJeF4N9Xu_YkYMvgvc6Vw_b8o8PnrofmcBz7Tc3qhzS5Chx_s8Xh5C9A4q-ee4p_aghbsun9DO13Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDwd0RPBUzkdEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Manzini retaliated when Johnson told him to pull up his socks if he still wanted to play for his team, then a squabble ensued.”Manzini has seen little action in the second round, having played regularly when he joined the club from Chippa United in August last year. The lanky player was given a rare run on 12 March when Usuthu met National First Division side Ubuntu Cape Town in the Nedbank Cup Last 16 round. But the well-travelled player looked rusty as he was unable to help his side advance to the next round of the Ke Yona Cup, with Ubuntu beating them 3-2 at King Zwelithini Stadium. Added another source: “It makes Manzini unhappy that he is no longer a regular because Johnson prefers the youth ahead of him. The coach and Manzini also had a falling out while they were still employed by Platinum Stars. “Johnson asked Manzini to stay with Dikwena instead of joining Chippa United back then but the player refused, as he had made up his mind. But their relationship was not the same when they reunited in Durban at the start of season.” However, Johnson denied the allegations, saying: “Your source doesn’t have the right information. Nothing like that has ever happened. He is just barking up the wrong tree.”Manzini was not available for comment at the time of going to print as his cellphone was off.
