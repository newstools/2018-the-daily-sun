The Constitutional Court has dismissed Home Affairs minister
Malusi Gigaba’s application to appeal a high court ruling to let the
Oppenheimers run a private immigration service at the OR Tambo International
Airport.Gigaba has been in and out of court last year, after the
billionaire family’s Fireblade Aviation applied to have its own private hangar
at the OR Tambo Airport in Ekurhuleni.Judge Sulet Potterbill ruled that Gigaba, who was still the
home affairs minister, had initially permitted the department to operate a
customs and immigration service at Fireblade’s terminal at the airport.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvvVtCmS2RQo3W-oN5k5EytqOAnncnol6PDykN8qdfa1Iz2vGcrBgHBUrj1eugez5EOjR60eQR-7iJixVgfbDy-3BjRcmwto9__RfPt0A4ZVp-uAtJbHcKafZ-umUeOJd75qHYimhppY3TrgfmragnzGgWaxzyMwnayCsf2MweGAREei6LuS3i_IMKv4aqRxd-c5MPuH7tTiMJQS577wkAKBVk17M-RY4VrK-sjLQMPHne7PcxMqmPZoY0v7iAZLnignEvznrYg-c1tnKeBPEMPN9OiMbo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPTKqjMjbBbGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

arguments that the terminal was considered unconstitutional.The constitutional court in December confirmed Potterill’s
ruling that Gigaba had permitted the extension of Fireblade’s services to
international travelers.They also ruled that Gigaba’s denial was a “serious
violation of the Constitution.”A similar application relating to the ruling’s appeal is
currently sitting with the Supreme Court of Appeal.
