Other patrons intervened and stopped them. The patron allegedly apologised to the tavern owner and left. Everyone thought the fight was over but screams from the street told them otherwise.The two men allegedly followed the 27-year-old patron outside. Once they caught up with him, they allegedly beat him to death. According to Silverton police spokesman Captain Jan Sepato, the dead man’s friend rushed him to Mamelodi Day Hospital but he was certified dead on arrival. He said investigations led the police to the two men’s houses, where they were arrested.“They will appear before the Pretoria Magistrates Court soon on a charge of murder.”
