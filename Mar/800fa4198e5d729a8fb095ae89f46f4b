That didn’t worry me because I know people don’t adapt to change easily,” she said.But after three months her business started booming. Linomtha said she allows people to buy goods on credit. “There is a high unemployment rate here and most people depend on social grants. I can’t allow people to go to bed hungry because they don’t have cash,” she said.Her nephew Lulama Mdudo (21), who lives in Town Two in Khayelitsha, comes every weekend to help her run the stall. He said he learns a lot from helping his aunt.“I learn how to communicate with people and improve my business skills.” Her neighbour Zolani Manqindi said the business was a blessing.“We buy what we need on credit and most shops don’t allow that. Linomtha is very friendly and helps us more than we help her.”
