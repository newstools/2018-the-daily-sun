The Facts Christina Kolbe from Dobsonville, Soweto says that she has been harassed by a manager at her workplace. She has laid grievances against her and yet nothing has happened, no action has been taken. She says that one of the latest instances was where the manager came to her shouting at her and threatening her that the CEO is going to have a disciplinary hearing for her. She says that the manager was shouting and pointing at her and eventually said, “If you hadn’t laid a complaint against me, none of this would be happening.” She further told her that she will make sure that Christina loses her job as no one will take her side against a manager. She now wants to know what she can do as nothing comes from the grievances that she has laid.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>What I did I contacted Scorpion to find out how they assist their clients in these situations Solution Referring to the Employment Equity Act, Scorpion Legal Advisor stated that Section 60 of The Act prohibits harassment in the workplace, by anyone. In cases of harassment, the employer is to consult with all the relevant parties to eliminate the conduct that is complained of. When a Scorpion member contacts them with this kind of complaint, the advisor contacts the employer in order to mediate the situation and to find out what the specific internal processes in the company are. In some instances, the advisor will draft the grievance on behalf of their client, this is because when complaining about harassment, a detailed grievance needs to be handed to the management or Human Resources department. In the grievance, the complainant needs to explain exactly what the harassment is and what recourse the complainant would like. If the company fails to follow the process set out in Section 60 of the Act, then the complainant can refer an Unfair Labour Practice Case to the CCMA. The CCMA will need to see proof of the grievances that have been filed, if there is no evidence of the grievances then the CCMA will refer the matter back to the company to resolve. You can strike back legally too!Click here
