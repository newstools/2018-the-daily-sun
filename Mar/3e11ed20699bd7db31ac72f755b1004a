AFTER years of suffering, they were finally given a place to call home. But residents of Kgotsong, near Bothaville in the Free State were left disappointed when they found they would be sharing their land with the dead! About 200 people were given land last Thursday which was previously used for burials. They said they were shocked as the authorities had decided the site wasn’t good enough to continue burying people but was fit for the living. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuBgYH5M-yga4NazY4mvcq2_TWu-eHLUcQWOTKpoiP7mEBlWZb6An4NfMR-WtIwbycbCCvv7Ib0tqaFOzyGJF9geKLHoIkUv7D0vYEKMwm_Q_KeU2bU0q8b6ddL1SXnSgpqXH7cqZ-DHiVNm9sCAxSVuUF-6UePMkUPzPy6TW-FzhdIBHb5KFg_Gp9z7kFgX7zwnyYP28r5vN3vBAKXDe8cIQHJx-TiJ7_OF74R3FCPjuVxVbrGEHzvgbqJ_li6x68rM_pM08qu0SuqN-4lW4feg9iQdZQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKNwTvBKmDfFEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

She said the municipality decided not to use the land as a graveyard as it became too muddy when it rained.“I couldn’t believe it when I realised I had to share my yard with dead people after the mayor promised to give us better land.” Puseletso said her three kids didn’t want to play outside because of the graves. Madikgutsana Mofokeng said the mayor should make a better plan if he’s serious about giving people stands. Nala Municipality mayor Theko Mogoje said before the residents were moved, there were meetings and no one raised concerns. “We made sure we could deliver services on the new site. We made sure every yard had sewerage and electricity. We will build houses for them soon,” he said.
