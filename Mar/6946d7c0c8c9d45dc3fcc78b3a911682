Zimbabwean chiefs have reportedly thrown their weight behind the ruling Zanu-PF party, saying that they would not allow a "toddler" to rule the southern African country.Zimbabwe was expected to go to its first presidential elections without long-time rivals Robert Mugabe and the late Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai.The elections were set to take place later this year, with President Emmerson Mnangagwa running as Zanu-PF's candidate. The MDC was likely to field in the youthful Nelson Chamisa, 40. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstZ-DbGR8xeWj3rphdEAc24tPRthxLJ3fHSF23Mdk4wqVgdmKFk7biRmul6IlT_3MeWMDogPSvs7BL8D8A8kN8urpvld4Yjn1lYr-8U1MCMM1Yyt-icTcOgMVvwiZ_S4OLmhldWQJIZ1ImbcGZui-gNDE5Ek-UyUuAnFtu4nky3QHVyRzKZICiVNC4sRfKLW8KPGGCqjswIj7syZRdMMHLBgYAKZKfJkBaRo4Wq2UjrpNn-LaMLzp9YpMG7nYmFFcIvukT_s8dsLkSFT8tyUEhDNFLWIF6mFXH5uQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLcyzJSMPYuREAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

As chiefs, we will not allow people who have no track record in fighting for the country’s liberation struggle."We will not support someone who was young or not yet born during the war to be president of Zimbabwe. Our support is with the people who fought for Zimbabwe's independence," Enos Musakwa also known as Chief Musarurwa was quoted as saying.https://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/we-wont-allow-a-toddler-to-rule-zimbabwe-chiefs-say-in-reference-to-mdcs-chamisa-20180301
