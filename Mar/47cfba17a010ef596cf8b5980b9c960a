They spotted the two men setting the shack alight.Six children aged between four and 11 were all rescued. Residents chased and caught the two men allegedly responsible for the fire and gave them people’s justice.Two community policing forum members then begged residents to stop the beating and phoned police.The angry mum identified one of the men as the sugar daddy.“I told him never to see my daughter again as he is over 28. My daughter also told him she didn’t want to see him again. “He said I’d pay for my actions.” The mum said three of her kids and three of her neighbour’s kids were in the shack at the time.“I was at a church service and ran home immediately.” She said she lost everything, but was relieved her kids escaped with only minor injuries.“That man ruined my life. “All our food, clothes, furniture and important documents were destroyed.”CPF member Promise Simelane said had it not been for their intervention the men would have been killed by the community. She appealed to SunReaders to help the mum restart her life.Mamelodi East police spokesman Captain Michael Mbewe said a case of arson was opened and two suspects were arrested.
