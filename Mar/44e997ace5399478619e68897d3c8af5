A fight broke out between the owner and the arrested suspect, which gave the other suspect a chance to flee with an undisclosed amount of cash, airtime and a cellphone.Residents who saw the man fleeing and heard the fight in the shop called the cops.Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock said a 23-year-old man was arrested and charged with business robbery. Police requested anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of the suspect who is still at large to contact Detective-Warrant Officer Calvin Botha on 082 301 9978. “The investigation continues,” said Kock.
