against Ajay in relation to a fraud case in Saharanpur related to the purchase
of land. Livehindustan.com, who said the Gupta brothers were the
seventh richest people from Saharanpur, reported that the Indian authorities
had seized documents from the raid and taken them into custody. They said the
Gupta brothers were not there. Another website, Patrika.com, said that Sahara's offices in
Hakkikat Nagar were also raided, as well as another property in Dehradun. All the Indian press reported that the brothers were wanted
in SA for corruption cases.The Hawks previously confirmed to News24 that Ajay is a
fugitive from justice. Two weeks ago it was reported that Ajay had been at a
wedding in India, when the Hawks were trying to track him down. News24
independently received information that he flew from there to Dubai. The Guptas' lawyer Ahmed Gani told News24 on Tuesday the brothers
had not told him about the Indian raids and he was unable to confirm if they
had taken place. In February, the Hawks raided the Saxonwold home of the
family, among other properties. Eight people linked to the family appeared in
the Bloemfontein Regional Court appeared on charges of theft, fraud, and
conspiracy to commit theft and fraud.The suspects were arrested in connection with investigations
into the Free State Vrede dairy farm project.In January, the Hawks also conducted search and seizure operations
at Free State Premier Ace Magashule's offices and the provincial office of the
department of agriculture.An affidavit has also revealed that Free State's
agricultural department – then under Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane
– allegedly paid R220m to the Guptas and some of their associates in what the
Asset Forfeiture Unit calls a "scheme designed to defraud and steal monies
from the department".SOURCE: NEWS24
