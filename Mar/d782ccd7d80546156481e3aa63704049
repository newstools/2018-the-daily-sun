RELEGATION was predicted for AmaZulu way before the start of the Absa Premiership season. Head coach Cavin Johnson is convinced of this. But with six games to go before the end of the current campaign, Usuthu occupy 11th place with 28 points from 26 games. Johnson reckons the Kwa­Zulu-Natal outfit will defy the odds, as his charges have almost guaranteed their league status for another season. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstTih1VLmewVFn95XFUaOyTqlFwL-OtbFfMtjnA8Ks_vJ_bP48-C0qia22_IvHkTcV6tnGlwQ2nGTyVMYsHg1qcHzd-d6b1DdMQYcjnza-K_WKhDJVfSt_TovWKJ2ylcYuwp3GDUDw8ISriRz504Dfw8WdQq3Ec0IxzOP5ohHP5Ero8BdhKNEdKehwyj6HfYwm0tmMJsqkse-z7MSgZlRof73npZu_ov7s-WBZ6oY8zzudI8paf5brTB7L4f6I16FVooU1oixfjwaw1gy2vXMVG-Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA9W5QLNYLPdEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Most people didn’t think it was a good move or that things would work out. But AmaZulu look all but set to hold on to their spot in the top flight.Speaking after their hard-fought goalless draw against Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium on Saturday, Johnson who was delighted with the point, described the current season as a crazy run. Usuthu displayed some heroic defending to return home with a valuable point. Johnson, who has been at the helm for seven months, did not try to hide his excitement about getting a draw against the Soweto giants. Usuthu have taken two points off Amakhosi, as their first round meeting in Durban also ended in a goalless draw. Said Johnson: “This team has something to play for in the PSL. They have shown that they can play in the top flight. A lot of people wrote a note next to AmaZulu’s name that predicted relegation, they wrote us off even before a ball had been kicked, but we have proved them wrong. “That shows the amount of work that we have put into this league campaign. I have a team of good people behind me, the technical and medical team also deserve credit for what we have done with the team so far.” Johnson said their league game against Amakhosi was a game of two halves. He felt his team did well in the first half but showed some tired legs in the second. “We are in a funny league – you win one game, you go into the top eight and you lose one game, you drop into the bottom half of the table. The top is as exciting as the bottom half! “Against Chiefs it was all about getting the tactics right I’m happy with a point, we did well in the first half.”
