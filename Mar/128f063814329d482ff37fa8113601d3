Former Muvhango actor Mutodi Neshehe’s 14-year nuptials to his American high school sweetheart, Lesley, are crumbling. Cracks in the star’s marriage began showing last year at the South African Film and Television Awards (Saftas) in Sun City, when the pair had a heated argument.Since then, the couple has had many squabbles because they allegedly can’t stand each other anymore.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>And according to the hunky actor, he wants out of the marriage so desperately that he’s moved out of their multimillion-rand matrimonial love nest in the upmarket estate of Honeydew Manor, west of Joburg.Asserted the hunky actor to the SunTeam: “I moved out on 2 June. I’m trying to get my divorce finalised as soon as possible, but she’s running around, adding to the bill.”And although he’s allowed to see his two paternal daughters, Mutodi said his estranged wife dictated how and when that happened.Insisted Mutodi: “She says I need supervised visitation in my house, but I’ll deal with everything legally.”The actor, who has also starred in Generations: The Legacy and is currently features in Grit – a series on US TV channel BET – claimed he had long suffered in silence.This while Lesley and her friends allegedly hurled insults at him.“If I tell you everything she’s said and done, you’ll be blown away. I’ve just kept quiet and moved on because I think she’s trying to set me up. I need to stop playing nice and deal with this truthfully.”Meanwhile, Mutodi’s estranged wife also confirmed the actor had moved out of their matrimonial home.But Lesley denied some of the allegations, instead accusing the actor of being abusive.Said Lesley: “Anyone who knows the law will know that supervised visits cannot be implemented unless there’s a good reason to.“So, I’ll allow you and everyone else to figure this one out for yourselves. Yes, Mutodi has left the matrimonial home and it’s been a while now.”Lesley insisted that she felt betrayed by Mutodi because she gave up everything for him.Said Lesley: “I gave up my country, family and friends to give him a platform to succeed, yet a he turned his back on me when things were not perfect in his eyes.”
