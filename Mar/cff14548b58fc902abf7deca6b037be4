You can always catch them in the field of play wearing their soccer kits that do not really reveal much about personal style and fashion sense.Very rarely do fans get to see some of their favorite football players in anything other than tracksuits and soccer kits.Some footballÂ  players do try to incorporate as much of their personal style into their kits as possible but they can only go as far as having their collar up, untucked jerseys, wearing their socks low on their shins and extravagant hairstyles.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvftFa7gzNYu0AUci_GYeSm_eFpfjmi8RT_7J5l3x_uUwwLfXn1Bvyumu1hlcnLDxzG3UDQG9trjHvv1cFn3cvRBHwDofr2jiKhjI9TQPUHpoW5EmD6Db8SyeJZ7mCZmIq0tz7YCKxS_o7ngiVkLncqS3nyAY2I4PZLk8JYY3o4E5BeYQfM11iTVKkDiNs31QQMdD9v4uyoijT0SL6kkWAqG4VY1FKHEotahbFq5GcGbkVcTdrIzNO_3x2pV0E6S-9tyE9hzdZLOT-7BFNB7ddmVMAXTuT2b-S8xg\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YSap3NsswOjxaY3goEkOB9xf0F8FNKdZbTxsZwHqUa0ohaePjYGniZZdIpGl55TKGqkABO2q2kWL4yq5EQkpL-rDcoAST26_4E8_sXGgA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAA8A5_3D8PTEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
