Ima give away 10k to The first person who does. I WANT ALL THE SMOKE,” he tweeted.Twitter users were obviously ready to take him up on his offer and fight anywhere, anytime.But in true Twitter style, users turned the joke on Emtee with everyone saying they doubt that Emtee could hold his own in a physical confrontation.Before long, people started to figure out that Emtee might have been speaking to one particular person.To be more specific, Cassper Nyovest.This conclusion was drawn from all the subtweeting shade thrown by Emtee.“I don’t flex about Sales. My very first album went platinum. Not my 3rd or Forth. Yalll keep on believing dee fu fu boys and Dey fu fu sales,” he said in this lastest episode of Emtee unraveling on Twitter.“K’sazoba fu fu fu,” he continued with the shade.But, Cassper caught the shade and clapped back real quick.“If you’re a rapper and you’re on twitter taking shots at other rappers for no reason at all, tryna get another rappers attention nje ? I cannot for one second believe that you’re doing well. You’ve played yourself. Wa sokola,” he said.
