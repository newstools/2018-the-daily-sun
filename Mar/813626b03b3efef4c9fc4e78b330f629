The gospel we preach must be balanced between teaching and giving to the poor. “Mphephu’s situation was brought to our attention two months ago by one of the villagers. “We then visited the poor gogo, who lives alone. We realised we needed to do something and bought her bags of mealie-meal, rice, soap, salt, cooking oil, chicken feet and tins of fish.” He said his church started its donation project in 2015 and also gives poor pupils uniforms. “We buy uniforms each year and donate them to poor pupils from different villages.“We move around to identify those in great need.” Gogo said: “I can’t believe I now have food on the table. “Buying food every month was very difficult because loan sharks always take all my money. “I’m grateful to Pastor Krest and his congregation for being so kind. “I pray they may be blessed with more money so they can give to the poor. I promise the pastor I’m going to join his church.”
