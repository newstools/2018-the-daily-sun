When a resident tried to save them, all three drowned. The bodies of a bystander and a church member were recovered the same day before the search for the third body was called off due to rough seas. Mandla said they were not worried that the search had been stopped. “Maybe the search will anger our ancestors. “That’s why we want the search to stop. We can feel that Awonke is still alive,” said Mandla. Awonke and the other man were members of St Paul’s Church. Reverend Luvo Valela said they used the beach for baptisms almost every year.“We are shocked. The men were loyal church members for eight years. They were at the beach to help me with a baptism.” The City of Cape Town’s Wayne Dyason said: “Police said they wouldn’t resume the search for the body yesterday morning. The body could be anywhere at this time due to the tidal movements and general sea conditions in the area.”Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said an inquest docket has been opened.
