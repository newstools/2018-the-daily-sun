KAIZER Chiefs coach Steve Komphela admits that his side’s progress to the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal means less stress going forward. This is Chiefs’ last chance to win some silverware during Komphela’s current reign, which started in June 2015.However, the outspoken mentor has insisted that he won’t invite unnecessary mental pressure for himself by declaring that Amakhosi will win the Ke Yona trophy. He made this statement following Chiefs’ 2-1 win over National First Division side Stellenbosch FC in a Last 16 round match at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss8iPU-FXUgzIMQOpvxXcdcMflXF9uT1f9MThaZjXGQZHNpx8fYm80ReBDSd0rHSizWlVUMMh_n95i1Dg9juATKSecyKLRgnjKo92kSUfbOKCVRLyIIU6UptAnglbi5VK5A_wraqSQHPHayfYLbXY4ZLmB1P_xNnNmTMHy7T5Xwxqby6R4z5GwciCgFW_cCdmaKDFltuychKW8WrZjVy-MFv1QjMerHp9d_noC_PQIQXpd-gAayiRCncsgnNIO0u5M01n5J_9wc3y8xzuIE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIsBHBTsCwr6EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I will appreciate the fact that we went through. It’s part of our obligation and responsibility to try and proceed to the semifinals and, if possible, win the trophy. But honestly, I’m not going to put myself under mental pressure. If you know what’s going to happen tomorrow why put yourself under so much pressure? And also if you don’t know, why put yourself under that pressure?”Amakhosi went to the match under the gun after a 3-1 defeat to their Soweto rivals Orlando Pirates in the league. “Before last week’s defeat to Pirates we weren’t losing matches. This win will ease the pressure, though, and give us the confidence that we are back on track again. However, the pressure is always there at Chiefs. Right now we will let players and fans enjoy this victory while we wait for the draw on Thursday.” Komphela has now channelled his focus into their Absa Premiership clash with AmaZulu at FNB Stadium on Saturday (6pm) as they hope to keep alive their slim chances of winning the title.“We will try and take each match as it comes. We are delighted to have won this one. There are a lot of positives that I will take from this match and obviously a few negatives that still need my attention,” added the coach.Meanwhile, Bloemfontein Celtic beat Richards Bay FC 3-1 at the Dr Molemela Stadium yesterday.
