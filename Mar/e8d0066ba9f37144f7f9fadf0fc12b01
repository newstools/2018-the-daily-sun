I didn’t waste any time getting back to the house. I got the shock of my life when I was welcomed by a broken door and some meat I had cooked lying near the gate. I went into the house to discover that thugs had raided it.” Lehlohonolo said the fridge was stripped bare by the thugs, who didn’t even leave behind the meat he had cooked for his Sunday lunch. “I believe this thug was watching ever step of what was going on at the house.“The way they took everything shows they were relaxed. I hope they will be arrested soon.”Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said a case of burglary was opened but no arrests have been made. Investigations continue.
