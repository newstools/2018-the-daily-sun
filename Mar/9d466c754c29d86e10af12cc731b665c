Tools, batteries, vehicles and any materials which could be perceived to have scrap value are being targeted.Since July 2017 more than R5m worth of hydrants, meters and valves have been stolen or damaged, she said.An appeal was made for anyone with information about these crimes to report it.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/theft-and-vandalism-threatens-cape-towns-water-security-20180318
