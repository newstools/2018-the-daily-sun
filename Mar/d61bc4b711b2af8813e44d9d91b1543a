We were reeling from shock.”Thandi said at first they were confused and didn’t know what to do. “We decided to call the village chief and he came to our house. Police and game rangers were also called and they took the crocodile away. It was a great relief to see the crocodile captured and taken from my yard. “My worry now is how on earth the crocodile ended up at my house. “I believe some evil person out there is trying to kill my family and sent us a crocodile.” Jackson Mavunda from SA Wildlife Trade confirmed that they took away the crocodile that was found in the Baloyis’ yard.Mavunda said the reptile was taken to the Luvhubu River where it happily swam into the deep water and disappeared.
