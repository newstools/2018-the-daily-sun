It takes two days after he has washed his hair for it to become dry. “I have clean, black and natural hair that grows very fast,” Benny said. “Some people ask me how I sleep at night and the answer is simple. “I fold my dreadlocks and use them instead of a pillow.”Benny said he washes his dreadlocks twice a month.“I spend more than R400 on washing the dreadlocks.” “I am a hairy person and the best way of keeping my hair is in dreadlocks,” said Benny, who is a mechanical engineering student at Maluti FET College in QwaQwa. He told the People’s Paper that people often ask him about his long dreadlocks.“Many people, especially ladies, really love my dreadlocks.“They often ask how I managed to grow such long hair since I am a man.“My dreadlocks are the centre of attraction and that makes me proud,” Benny told the People’s Paper.
