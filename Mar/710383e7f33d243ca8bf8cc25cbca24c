He told the People’s Paper that people often ask him about his long dreadlocks.“Many people, especially ladies, really love my dreadlocks.“They often ask how I managed to grow such long hair since I am a man.“My dreadlocks are the centre of attraction and that makes me proud,” Benny told the People’s Paper.
