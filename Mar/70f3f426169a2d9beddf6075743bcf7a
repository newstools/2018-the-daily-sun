Kingdom Mabuza, Emalahleni Municipal spokesman, said the blockage was caused by rain water that spills into the sewerage system. “Officials are attending to the problem and it will be fixed soon,” he told Daily Sun. He said the delay in fixing the pipe was caused by the fact that the ground in which they’re installing a bigger line is waterlogged.He said a lot of work has to be done to keep the ground stable.
