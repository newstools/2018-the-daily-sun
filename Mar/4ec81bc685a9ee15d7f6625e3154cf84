THE SAPS Crime Intelligence arrested over nine government
officials on charges of corruption at the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Correctional Services.In a media briefing conducted by Police Minister, Bheki Cele
and Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, Cele said the officials were allegedly
involved in illegally releasing at least 36 parolees."All of which were women, over a period of more than a
year without following proper procedures for financial gain," Cele said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstD52AVVtUm6NkKP1qQvQB713yeMXfoCAaQCFj8C7x5uiUvv4lee8zWh4Ei5vw6VAHsyupQlsmgquhSpH_UN7-Q5mHmt4ImK4bnRFq5N7sDEyDeKCA_UOkS3v09_nfNF1QeZmsIbeCL58c7cLivhNKAVol6SFno69gsdFesKnc1SvcHQIFUgYzz7QZnLNUjLbS9uVwhRmUKoLytJOXqNQhocMwblVE17gqisifB7PhruTpf6nSSOtwkAQDmPTP0gyBXG9knoM__IQCNmCb09wSKokDJIvI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzB8chrqebrnBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

multi-disciplinary team of detectives who worked hard in cracking the backbone
of a complicated web of corrupt activities involving the officials.It is alleged that the officials were actually paid in cash
or into their bank accounts by the parolees families or friends.According to Cele, the investigations further revealed that
officials, would demand bribes between R3000
for those from African countries and R6000 for those from outside Africa.It's reported that the foreign parolees, most of which were
drug smugglers had to be released and deported to their countries of origin
through the Lindela deportation centre.Although through the corrupt Home Affairs officials they
would instead be sent directly to the Johannesburg Home Affairs office for an
unproceduralÂ  and illegal early release.However, Gigaba said the Home Affairs Department is working to review its internal control measures, as well as delegation of powers."We will adopt an integrated approach involving all relevant departments to ensure proper processes and procedures are adhered to," Gigaba said.
