"The EFF was the first to question VBS giving Zuma a loan, but we were led to believe, even by the reserve bank, that it was above board," Ndlozi said.Ndlozi said the Reserve Bank should create an enabling environment for the existence and protection of black-owned banks."The Minister must instruct the Reserve Bank and other shareholders, like the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) to find a long lasting solution," Ndlozi said.
