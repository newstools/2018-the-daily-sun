Rapper Cassper Nyovest has become used to people pointing out the fact that he is a high school drop out every chance they get.The rapper shared a picture of himself next to his orange Bentley on Twitter and once again had to deal with some people reminding him he was a drop out.Some Twitter follower even went as far as photo-shopping a Matric certificate onto the picture, suggesting Cassper should rather be showing that off instead of the Bentley.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst8z4fIP85exd772o8w1bqfyvN8LMmMaSg_PIX5-BuDy4-P_g0VqGwePGnN3FgEvSkzMFafIo6CPv1uodqNuBgRTHkBXbnq6skSw_DeSB5sd8V7WUGiu06Z1tKB2dFQiCmX8OtEELf_J4IFK5seqCJ6wv55G0ioMxvUtGp7e8CirDkyj0Qsojdae6y8mm71hhnAJuB0qMGUrYCjpLqTIZDhxjSXLi93Rm7mVT37SBQB0Isbj6QfF1kBpSqgEFi_-mwfa6ggQSGgTplQM59mi3NS44ukjSb4jaa0ew\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBQYMVOInmLvEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
