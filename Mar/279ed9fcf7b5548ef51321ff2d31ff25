the learner be reinstated at school with immediate effect and, indeed, he was
taken to school immediately and he was reinstated," he said.Koma revealed that a plan was discussed with the principal,
setting out how the pupil would be accommodated for the purpose of catching up
with lost school time.According to court papers in News24's possession, the school
and principal Jimmy Steele, who were the first and second respondents
respectively, were also ordered to pay the legal costs of the case.'No help from education department'Koma said the parents took the legal route after the
provincial department of education allegedly failed to assist them."Their main worry was that the child was at home and
now they needed an urgent solution," he said.The lawyer claimed that according to the school's policy,
white pupils were allowed to have 4cm-long hair, while black pupils were only
allowed to have 1cm-long hair.Koma said the pupil, whose name is known to News24, had
natural hair, "not a hairstyle".When asked about the hair policy on Thursday, Steele would
not deny nor confirm whether such a policy existed at the school."We did receive the court order. It is executed to the
letter of the word. But at the moment the rest of the case is sub judice.
That's all I'm advised to say at the moment."Provincial education department spokesperson Sam Makondo
said the department was not initially aware of the court case."Yes, we were not aware and that's why we were not even
in court. As a law-abiding department, we accept the interim order and the rest
of the issues will be heard in court on 17 April," he said.When asked if the department was aware of the policy,
Makondo said they were investigating the matter."Remember this is a matter that has raised more
questions than answers and the department has launched an investigation into
the matters of the school. Findings will determine the course of action that
must be taken to improve on the issues at the school," he said.SOURCE: NEWS24
