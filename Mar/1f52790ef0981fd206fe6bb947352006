Residents said the thugs know these vehicles don’t have tracking devices. “The next person to be hijacked might not escape unharmed and the department won’t compensate that driver. So now we want risk allowances.” Another worker said they are willing to work but don’t feel safe.“We work in high risk areas like KwaMashu Hostel. The department might not care about their vehicles but we have families who care about us. We want assurance that should anything happen to us, our families won’t suffer.” The Sunteam yesterday sent an email to KZN Health to enquire about a report from the health centre about the incidents mentioned by department spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda. Several phone calls were made but there was no answer.
