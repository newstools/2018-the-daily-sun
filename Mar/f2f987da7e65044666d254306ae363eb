now access special funds through Treasury reserved for national disasters."As the minister responsible for disaster management, I
have recognised that special circumstances exist, and have decided to declare
the drought as a national state of disaster in terms of Section 27 of the
Disaster Management Act," he said.Mkhize called on all citizens to continue to save water and
change behaviour, as South Africa is currently a water scarce country.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-drought-declared-a-national-disaster-20180313
