The African National Congress (ANC) will not support former president Jacob Zuma in his upcoming corruption trial, but the party's members can - as long as they don't wear the party's regalia.This is a very different approach from Zuma's rape trial, as well as initial attempts to lay corruption charges against him, in which he received overwhelming support from ANC structures, with many calling the charges politically motivated. ANC secretary General Ace Magashule said the party noted the corruption charges against Zuma.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsud8oYVyYjJ70aPw06kTPGt9I8f2H5m30k5t7yDPdWvfvHFzqXDgiTghNor9iMYUT3x6urJvD-z_zcDgHjiQUVyRHuSkczhamInCmZW0SthfnfIczgSyGwVx3eSioWx-bjBVVz5-1mL7aNzvHiX6UgnZQOAa770-q9ZfWD_T2JeBH4wonIWDLUo30UdIP2M6maT3pJy6d1vXe3Byqf79mtWqGJ9mA-h6XRwzaMxuoYxiRILYgScxSezCaIXggXWm3SWZGDoaPoTRXHqpsQgl0zOxqOM2X0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJDLFfPMabu9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

All former presidents of the party remain ex officio members.Magashule said several times during the briefing a person must be presumed innocent until proven otherwise."Allegations are allegations," he also said. "We are not protecting or defending anyone."The meeting did however deal with corruption and state capture."The NEC appreciates that, in the context of this campaign, some members and leaders of the movement may find themselves called to account by law-enforcement agencies, the legislatures and the Judicial Commission of Inquiry dealing with the matter of state of capture."The ANC wishes to reiterate its principled approach that persons so implicated, should be presumed innocent until and unless proven otherwise," said Magashule.He noted that members of the ANC -  in their individual capacity - and society have the right to express their sympathy and solidarity with anyone affected, and not through any structures of the movement including the ANC's leagues and the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association."Members involved in such actions are discouraged from displaying ANC’s paraphernalia and thus creating the false impression that the ANC as [an] organization identifies with, or approve of, the misdemeanors of which any any member or leader maybe accused."https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zuma-loses-anc-support-for-looming-corruption-trial-20180325
