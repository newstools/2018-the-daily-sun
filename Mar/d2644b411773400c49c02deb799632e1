Similarly, a management representative and three examiners were arrested at the Hercules Roadworthy Centre in Pretoria in November and are facing charges of fraudulently issuing roadworthy certificates to vehicles that were not presented for testing.Vadi said that the inter-departmental investigations into the operations of the two testing stations found gross violations of the National Road Traffic Act (1996) and the codes of practice regulating private vehicles testing stations. “Vehicles that are not roadworthy contribute to the high accident rates and fatalities on our roads. Testing stations that issue fraudulent roadworthy certificates are complicit in this regard,” said Vadi.“We are acting in the public interest by preventing cars that are not roadworthy from driving on public roads where they could endanger the lives of the public,” he emphasised.
