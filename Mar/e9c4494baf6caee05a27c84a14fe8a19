GOGO Merrian Tsotetsi couldn’t hold back her tears when she walked into her new home for the first time on Monday. The 75-year-old from Orange Farm, Joburg, told Daily Sun: “This is the best gift I could ever ask for. From today, my life will never be the same.” Gogo Merrian had been living in a shack since she moved to Orange Farm from Evaton in the Vaal in 1994. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv1l8wzpTqr2TbfUmJO5SzmBGeO8yBDwrpwjiL6ml0yI7fVgJpq-fF9va4yKhIGoU4hSzgDMM-TzHHudKcb0Mo69beY8det4tfplOPkujBMiUyC4Vf20UrjVjCGJHxF63c-SRU7A0qfP4wLB9wean_WGpymN197f-ElAUPcscU9VRqtUdcVFMdB1bJ_mRsH7bTvDpr4uCT88nDoN4vxVMs9bhrudpA3aB2qjaKfmjS3a7_I1mUjOsk63AvuDSq9hAX2WqGCK186lnNjOigteL_mnG8KoS8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJUkrSArW3EHEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Life was very difficult in the shack.” Moya Wolff, the NGO’s head of fundraising and marketing, said they partnered with the private sector to help those in need. “We are also handing over certificates to 78 students who were trained in crew leading, parking marshalling, community safety, leadership and project managing,” she said. Human settlements spokesman Keith Khoza said they were grateful to the NGO and private companies that worked with them. “This shows that a lot can be achieved when we work together as government, the private sector and the community.” “Today, we have uplifted the lives of the elderly, people living with disabilities and child-headed homes. “We hope we can do more to ensure that we provide security and comfort for those in need.”
