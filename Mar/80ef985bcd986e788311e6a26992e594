Music producer Heavy K is one of the most open celebrities when it comes to his background and it is no secret that he comes from humble beginnings.Instead of sulking and wallowing in self pity, the Drumboss instead used that experience as motivation to make a better life for himself and his family.Speaking on Afternoon Express, he revealed that while his parents could not spoil him with material things, they did spoil him with love, which is all that matters at the end of the day.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssdlGNzrNqz-Md7tsy4_FgVOkrZujJJYdBpI4MW8xlg0ev0ZridZN0XFkBkguz58nm0StFohgA0Kfoc9yQ4gHhidkaWyvZGN2f0tnFRft104-yAo9ygCpvQnfNZWaqvgRcRlDaHzarv62O7sTZMnOBEHEJg_59r5Ujo9fLE6LnG4shpJ2limigDkHAlcZcO365BOlcMsQxZTr3ArhqaGFouwPS09zNXxj0Gzwik6Ec1OVkxuRXQOIxFFkZtGSsskyyAxPgrw7uh-MLFFeYGNrpbMhV2MSuRsKTLcA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCAYhEnUjTHIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

My parents had so much love for me. Even when my mother was still alive, she loved me” he said.He said that some of the sacrifices that his mother had to make for them, still break his heart to this day.“We are a family of four, my big brother and my parents. When we ate, I would see that on my mother's plate there would not be meat while the three of us would have meat. I would ask her why she didn't have meat and she would say she didn't eat meat" he said.Only when he was older did Heavy K realise that the only reason his mother did not eat meat was so he and his brother could have enough.He added that this situation fuelled his desire to succed in life. “I am a positive person, this made me more eager to make something of my life”Heavy K recently brought his father to tears when he granted his wish by buying him a house and a car.
