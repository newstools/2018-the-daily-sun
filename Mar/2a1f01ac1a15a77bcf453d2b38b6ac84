GOVERNMENT’S broken health inspection service at local level has been directly implicated in the whole Listeriosis epidemic – one of the biggest such crises the world has seen. But now it appears that government’s strategy of communication for the entire crisis is also broken.Labour union Fawu expressed disbelief about the department of health’s apparent floundering in the media, which is causing more panic and confusion.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssdjcCgWb-Qau2nKtDgKFTYKPF-WBx2uLdlTmW1I3Int--dXLfV2NZQJ1uj23SCU84tP1BEEHwZkHlJ5-FRxB26wW3RidWvEuCtV392VvMHGrzQFArLgjbhxIMMyvATlDXllP3WgT49iVXUDcffYvsps4VX6Vp9EakjA8iwI4qMHpkuaro4o3F_Id2-t1GLknCJQRNyN5pffOXlLFHO1R4BkVDjMOuk6rhc2UiYv0g5nrKxApsCEUOFOrmdB6Q2vspZh6_DBVz_GUFmvUeTwNSU9xYycC8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzD_h9DCTuz4oEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Fawu general-secretary Katishi Masemola said Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi’s pronouncement on the outbreak had only created havoc.He said that following the minister’s declaration, people in Mzansi developed fear of all cold meat in their fridges.Masemola said the minister should have clarified which food brands or which manufacturing plants were specifically implicated, as other factories not hit by Listeria infection were also suffering.“We call on the minister to clarify with concrete and clear statements that his pronouncements created a health scare and panic among the nation,” said Masemola. He said the minister failed to clarify that not all companies involved in the ready-to-eat meat controversy could be blamed for the outbreak.“A glaring example is the Eskort businesses, which produce and process ready-to-eat meat such as polonies, viennas and Russians.“With RCL Foods red-flagged, but with results still to be confirmed, the minister should have made it clear that the RCL ready-to-eat products may not be bought or consumed as a precautionary measure only until irrefutable results are released.” He said Eskort and RCL Chicken products had experienced a drop in sales.“The consequences will be severe in that illegally dumped and illicitly traded products will take over and jobs, estimated at thousands, lost,” he said.
