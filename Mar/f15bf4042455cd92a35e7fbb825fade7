We are told that these men may be linked to many robberies that were committed in KwaZulu-Natal. I need to commend the multidisciplinary approach employed by police in KZN that is ensuring that criminals are brought to book. Various police units working together with other policing agencies outside the SAPS as well as in the private sector are ensuring that criminal syndicates are dismantled. We once again wish to remind criminals not to even think of shooting at our police officers as they will be making a mistake,” said Major General Langa.Naicker said that on 23 February 2018 at 16:10, this group of felons entered a shop in KwaMaphumulo and robbed the employees of cash. "As the suspects were fleeing they opened fire on Captain Mhlanzi who was off duty at the time. The police officer (54) was taken to hospital where later died. He was laid to rest this weekend"Added the Acting Provincial Commissioner: “We also call on all communities to distance themselves from criminals that live in their neighbourhood. Even the families of these criminals should play a role in discouraging them from being involved in criminal activities. It is very disturbing to see criminals receiving a hero’s send off during funerals where family and friends turn up in numbers to show support to these criminals.”
