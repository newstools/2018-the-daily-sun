IT WAS a friendship struck back in the academy days at KRC Genk in Belgium.since then, Anele Ngcongca and Kevin de Bruyne have kept contact, to an extent that they still check each other up regularly.“Obviously, the friendship isn’t as it used to be back when Kevin was in the Genk juniors,” said Ngcongca, now in the books of Mamelodi Sundowns.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstYoH4XVfdhCwVDwKEog3aM_XNNxtT_wQYWzaJR0zx-aW4UOcld2-3L2JLyXv-UmI11FCU-jRHFoEva9_HYY-8wKX46NECwY2Sxf_BaqSbB6IfMmMttyaB1dtZQh8_LvrdFTouZMGDf7NV4SX3siYU9l7iKpz24VlYqd_8NLPBcRSfU_Vxa5CPRWw1Dw_rJPzgnowtHJ_otMFHCzM0NtTm4fHxtCBvS_8vEgbLmmXnAmXqP_ovcPlREhJkszIiibq4tE-r0ORmviXi4cWF1\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLpV4flR1ED0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I’m also very close to Thibaut Courtois and Christian Benteke. These were the young boys at Genk. I was their senior. De Bruyne sat next to me in the dressing room, and now I watch him terrorise defenders in the English Premiership. That’s football. I’m nothing without football. It’s taken me to places I’d never have dreamt of.”It’s not difficult to figure out who Ngcongca will be rooting for in the English Football League final between Manchester City and Arsenal this afternoon, is it?As De Bruyne flourishes at the Etihad Stadium, Ngcongca has slowly been fading on the bench at Sundowns.Thapelo Morena’s ever-improving form has limited Ngcongca’s opportunities in the star-studded Brazilians side, restricting the former Bafana Bafana right-back to a mere nine appearances so far this season.Ngcongca, though, is not losing any sleep at all over it.“When I joined Sundowns I had injury problems. I came back, but suffered another injury setback,” said Ngcongca.“But that happens to every athlete. I’m back and fighting my way back into the team. Team selection is up to the coach. If I remember well, I’m the second most-capped player of all time at Genk. I was in the team of the century. I was regular in Bafana. I played in France.“To come to Sundowns and not play regularly is difficult. But at my age I must also be proud to see Thapelo rising to the occasion. These are the future of Bafana and as a senior player I must guide him. I talk to the coach. We have a good relationship, dating back to our days at Bafana. I’m mature enough not to go home angry for not playing."Sundowns play more games and the chance will come. Moaning and being grumpy doesn’t help you as a player.”As one of the senior players, Ngcongca has no qualms but appreciates the big brother role he’s indirectly assumed.He added: “When I joined Genk there were players who helped me. If you remember, I played for Fortune FC and I was among the 10 players Quinton Fortune put in school in Simon’s Town with his own money… among others, Franklin Cale, Giovanni Rector, Bevan Fransman, Ashley Hartog and Kurt Lentjies.With the league and the Nedbank Cup dream on for Sundowns, Ngcongca wants nothing more than lay his hands on his first domestic title.“We can’t repeat the same mistake we did when we gave Wits the league last season,” he declared.“This was my first time ever in the PSL and that’s motivation for me enough to win.“In Europe I won all that I could. Getting a PSL medal will be a cherry on top. Hopefully, I’ll have that medal to give to my mum end of season,” he said. Like this story?
