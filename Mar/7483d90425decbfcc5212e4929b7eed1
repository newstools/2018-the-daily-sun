After three weeks of recovery I am feeling better. “The doctors told me the wounds are moving along so nicely. I can feel my feet now. I think I will be okay after a year and three months, or so.”He said he was still shocked, like all South Africans, and in the dark on why he was attacked while training for the SA Road Championships that were held in Bloemfontein last weekend. Explained a still sedated Gwala: “I can remember clearly what happened. The attackers didn’t even talk to me. They only greeted me for the first time then they separated. “They didn’t say anything to me.”This attack has cost the athlete at least a year of training and competing. Gwala could very well have qualified for the World Championships to be held in August this year.
