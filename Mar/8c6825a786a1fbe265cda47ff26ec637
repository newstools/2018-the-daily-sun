The men cannot be identified until an identity parade has been conducted.During his first address as minister, Police Minister Bheki Cele said the men involved in the shootout conspired to rob the Capitec Bank ATM opposite the police station and identified the police station as a place to get firearms.The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) welcomed the arrests and condemned the attack on the police officers."We welcome the speedy reaction demonstrated by our men and women in blue in apprehending some of the alleged perpetrators of the senseless killing of the police officers and the recovery of the stolen firearms," Richard Mamabolo, Popcru spokesperson said in a statement."It is under such circumstances where police and community members work closely together that we can jointly combat criminal activities within our communities, and we encourage such relations to continue as crime can no longer be seen as a uniquely police issue," Mamabolo said.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sixth-suspect-to-appear-in-court-for-ngcobo-police-shooting-20180301
