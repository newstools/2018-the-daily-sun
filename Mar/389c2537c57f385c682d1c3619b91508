They then walked towards the victims’ car. One of them started shooting.“We were all scared. We thought they might also attack us so we ran for our lives. “They did not care that there were people on the street watching. They went there, shot the two and immediately left,” said the witness.Another witness told Daily Sun they suspect the killing is related to taxi violence.“The father is a known taxi boss,” he said.Bystanders said the suspects should not have killed an innocent child.“They were ruthless and without mercy. They deserve to rot in jail,” said Emmanuel Skhosana.Hillbrow police spokesman Sergeant Mduduzi Zondo said the two died at the scene. Anyone with information leading to arrest of the perpetrators should contact the nearest police, he said.
