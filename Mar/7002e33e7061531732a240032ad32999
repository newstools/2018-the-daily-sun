He said Tooley was shifting blame because he was failing in his position. Since he took over the provincial treasury, audit outcomes have gone backwards, he claimed.“I expect Tooley to retract his unfounded statement that I participated in bankrupting the Limpopo provincial government. Tooley and others have failed to deal with allegations of corruption.”He said the Auditor-General reported that the Limpopo provincial government paid R116 million for land worth R8 million at Tubatse Municipality in October 2015.“It is alleged that Limpopo politicians are key beneficiaries of this corrupt transaction,” Masondo said.He said the Limpopo provincial government wasn’t bankrupt in 2011.
