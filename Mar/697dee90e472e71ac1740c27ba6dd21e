An inquest docket was opened for further investigation and the firearms seized will be sent for ballistic tests to establish if they were used in any other crimes in the province."KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Major General Bheki Langa commended the police."We remain committed to eradicating crime and no wanted suspect will remain on the run forever," he said.  Zwane appealed to motorists to take extra precaution when driving."Beware of any suspicious-looking persons or vehicle following your vehicle. Be vigilant when entering or leaving your premises. Avoid parking in isolated areas, especially at night, or socialising while sitting in your car while on the road or pavements."https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/kzn-cops-kill-wanted-hijacker-in-shootout-
