A CONFEDERATION of African Football (Caf) outing may be just what SuperSport United need to take their mind off their Premier Soccer League (PSL) misery.While Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits go into their Caf Champions League fixtures brimming with confidence, United are certainly not in a good frame of mind.Along with Cape Town City, the PSL teams will be engaged in their respective first round clashes away from home this week.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsus3FCRJ2CJdVAiyxA-q8kjltghnTxZhAW-MNtO8XmRGmF2cck1UVtBjgYbUz55z6PhEbpqq8d-9Qp3AlKHdH5TDilc7AgRKgxgMMvgPitLR3PJNXJmVh6kZsRAnNR1bED1UH1MXNyhozQC2MbirhdOHkXowBa7id3QRJwB-uzKoqHvtsvouXHCIjy7FXEYgUCkz9xwoZpSMdTU-lTUbS1LGgVtRB4yfuCGiyoz9F21VE2RAqecv2kJJsH74LG265NZuRe9AhCALnZ5WXMa\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA6gxdzAlQgBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But the Confederation Cup may be just what the doctor ordered for Matsatsantsa.It’s a different story for Sundowns, however, who go into the Champions League without domestic worries, as they top the Absa Premiership standings.Apart from his Pet Shop Boys music, nothing excites Pitso Mosimane more than the prospect of an African safari these days.The Sundowns coach’s commitment to continental football is unquestionable and he still feels the Pretoria giants have unfinished business in the Fifa Club World Cup following their exploits two years ago.“It is going to be very tough. In fact, it will be even tougher considering the fact that most clubs know who Sundowns are now. “We have experience now and know what is needed to get positive results in such matches. We have the quality and depth, and will take it one game at a time – just like we did last year,” said Mosimane.Jeremy Brockie sounded excited to be returning to the Caf stage. Now on the books of Sundowns, the New Zealand striker came close to clinching the winners’ medal with United last year.Said Brockie: “It’s nice to come to Kigali early to get a feel of the country and the conditions. We got a chance to watch their (Rayon Sports’) league game to see what they are all about. It helps to prepare us mentally. “I was lucky to get a taste of Caf football last year and now know what to expect.”
