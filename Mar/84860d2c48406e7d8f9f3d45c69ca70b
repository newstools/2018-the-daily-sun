Like other versions of the Kwid, it is also powered by Renault’s 999cc engine. According to Renault, the new automatic version has an average fuel consumption of 4,4 litres every 100km, which is lower than that of the manual gearbox version. Unlike most other automatics, there is no gear lever for your driving options. Instead, there is a dash-mounted dial with three modes: reverse, neutral and drive. The dial is designed to make driving effortless. An advanced control unit automatically optimises gear shifts according to driving conditions for smooth and regular acceleration.Standard features include a user-friendly multimedia and navigation system with USB and auxiliary connections – with a speed-sensing volume control, driver’s airbag, power steering, air-conditioner and front electric windows. The Kwid’s high stance and durable design highlights a sense of driving security while its longer wheelbase is the foundation of a spacious, comfortable cabin, plus more rear leg room, while boot space is a decent 300 litres.As is standard across Renault’s entire product range, the Kwid comes standard with a five-year/150 000km mechanical warranty and Renault also currently offers a one-year comprehensive insurance cover for Kwid buyers. With its appealing design and range of equipment, the Kwid remains a promising offering which is sure to meet the needs of anyone looking to buy an entry-level car.
