Some people get sick because they have no choice but to eat the rotting food,” she said. Malebo complained that electricity units often went missing from their prepaid meters after power outages. “We refuse to accept these constant power cuts. In Mamelodi and extension 1 of Nellmapius, there are hardly any outages,” she said. “Is it because they are paying bonds? This isn’t fair. We are residents too and we vote. We pay the same tax as everyone else.” Petronella Matlabo (42) said she had been forced to buy a generator and a solar panel. “I’m tired of throwing away food. I can’t afford this. “If we were white and could afford lawyers, we would sue the municipality for the food we’ve had to throw away,” she said. When electricity was eventually restored, the residents joyfully returned home. However, they vowed to return to the streets if their power was cut again. City of Tshwane director Sello Chipu said they had a problem with cable theft. He said a contractor had tampered with a cable feeding the area, which added to the problem. “We managed to restore power and the Metro police will now be visible around cable theft hot spots. Savannah Estate has also offered to send patrollers,” said Chipu.
