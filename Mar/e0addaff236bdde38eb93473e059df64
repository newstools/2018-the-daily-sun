THE court was filled to capacity when nine senior cops appeared in connection with the Marikana massacre. Scores of Marikana residents and Amcu supporters sat in the Rustenburg Magistrates Court in North West yesterday while protesters gathered outside and sang songs directed at the police. The gates of the court had to be locked to limit the number of people in the grounds of the court. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvsJRZ7-8kYpxxQOy-Q2RoiJlalHpakFTslMyfXYAQuzgEzhuouxrz3CGYtY0h83anpAQpq90C4-DQajlwzxOZnNHrwL1ZtK0l559RG5i8gHJDC-R5JXGeuMc3UfyYAgtVEf-LO9Ke4U_5WtxsTG-kz_mPI1QFeyFBJhxD6LnMsZOgODuq_SorAV2S9vFOd_21YHKf4D6misww5BoVaqxEXBGUK4RwebhyCtB8RjObIR4Zd8ap5fTzy4sQY2JQsDUqqBkijDMcesZjjWCtLNTlSECPZRCA\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YTTraso9vKC86mt2BbcCJBoANAP8HWLw3iARTRGaTHPwgryYuQ3HPQvu_yccHF_PelK2pc4VZ54bb-wm-NqQg2xC0i0_DSLWqK_h7qYeA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOsNPB-NnSDtEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They included former North West deputy police commissioner Major-General William Mpembe, who testified at the Farlam Commission in 2016. The nine are accused of murder, attempted murder and defeating the ends of justice in connection with the killing of 34 striking miners in 2012.  Mpembe and Colonel Johannes Vermaak are accused of giving orders to cops to shoot the fleeing miners. They are also accused of lying to the Marikana Commission for testifying that they had not given the orders. Mpembe is listed as the first accused in both cases. In the first case, he appeared with Gideon van Zyl, Dingaan Madoda and Oupa Pule. In the second case, he was charged with Shepherd Nkosana, Collin Masilo, Katlego Sekgwelea and Phillip Makhubela. Both cases were transferred to the North West High Court sitting in Mogwase, near Sun City, for a pretrial hearing on 18 June. The cases were being handled by theIndependent Police Investigative Directorate. While both cases are related to events that happened during the Amcu strike in August 2012, they are not connected to the main Marikana Massacre. No arrests have been made for the massacre itself.
