GATVOL jailbirds have asked Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha to intervene after one of them was moered by warders. A photo has been leaked to Daily Sun showing an inmate at Ermelo Prison, Mpumalanga, talking about this. The prisoner (28), who’s serving a two-year sentence, says he was left with a swollen face after the assault. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvBHYDT-PdtwTf7mybLo3kOSQ_35c0Vtr3sZqX6492XI_tUybRgr4WAPDEBlAC1Q4t2ta5wSE5bTkb4QfJlpbG0N9b6RUk7fz5-zfafu0_W0pBEnN73soQiHxYNBEG72xbkxl9YyS2RbArYsOKRGglxfLEmD3oTwvyY3eP7lxEacm_NdToTue5jNrM2EjTVEhwIa1tyu95H2lStstSrdfvwqiFK99fTyOt3suUSfqgUlGWCBYqBzgBS1l46gbeE5egptjcXigq414RqDbWFWcDGJWV_Mdg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHyd4-0zsI3LEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Responding to Daily Sun’s questions, Correctional Services spokeswoman Matshidiso Mapole said warders looking for contraband on 10 March tried to frisk the jailbird. “The offender retaliated and assaulted a female warder who has a disability and can’t walk properly,” she said.  “We called for backup and minimal force was used to control him. He was taken to hospital for medical attention. “The department instituted an internal investigation and the offender was transferred to Standerton Prison for an investigation to be conducted.”
