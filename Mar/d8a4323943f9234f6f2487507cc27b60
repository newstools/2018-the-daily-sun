whole lot more.The 38-year-old from Denver hostel in Joburg was poured with

afternoon and around 3pm neighbours called to tell me that another woman was
moving in. I was happy because I thought I was finally free from all the abuse

after two years and do something that would change her life forever. Her ex disguised himself as a woman to get Hlengiwe’s
attention. After that he poured
her face with acid and tried to make her drink it but she managed to fight him
off.“From that day I knew my life would take a drastic turn. I
lost my job and no one wants to employ me. I was the sole bread winner at home
and 5 people had to drop out of school because I could no longer support them.”Hlengiwe is pleading with Sunlanders to help get her face fixed so she can get a job and
continue supporting her family.
