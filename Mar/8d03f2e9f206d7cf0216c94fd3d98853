THE police say Umzimkhulu councillor Sindiso Magaqa was not poisoned. Testifying before the Moerane Commission which is investigating KZN’s political murders, Brigadier Bongani Maqashalala yesterday explained how Magaqa died. “The toxicology reports we were waiting for are back. They exclude poisoning as the cause of death. He died from gunshots.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuKOK8eqq5TlKdRW4ccGfWhYnC8SvuCskwjxqE2c4_mHtLBSUgdwgGcwjHfzWsbWJPi4g45F1g06Cfu5aEWBe3bQhFfufdNgASSp4sYxM3s2tOArIjq0Qn7GruUxtwYvr_jIAJ-0LhdFRgxcSqHYevhvU4DG0FnH4G4_2yY9sfu--KtvGEV9vo6FqmHzhHtPOVMc09KaD5c4Z09047N8-KsTaRW3xhgBlB92a5oioWXL3VoGmb1m5_h45K7P3u3gDrzKb7fj80fHyNET5s5w2_sL3U1DYE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM73APbXgJSTEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It is up to those we communicate with to update the rest of the family.”Maqashalala didn’t say when the police got the report or whether suspects would be arrested soon. He said he could not share details as it could ruin the investigation. Former ANC Youth League leader Magaqa was shot in Ibisi in July and died in September after complaining of stomach problems. Brigadier Tebogo Mbele testified about the murder of ANC Councillor Zodwa Sibiya, who was shot at Glebelands Hostel in Umlazi in April 2016. Mbele said a possible murder suspect had been identified but there were delays in making an arrest, as they were waiting for forensic evidence. Major-General Bheki Langa was scheduled to testify yesterday but couldn’t attend due to commitments.
