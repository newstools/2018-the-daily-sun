PASSENGERS on a flight from Malaysia to Bangladesh were given a show they would probably prefer to forget when a man got naked, masturbated, peed on his seat, and attacked a flight attendant!According to Coconuts, this outrage happened on Malindo flight OD162 from Kuala Lumpur to Dhaka on Saturday.The man in question is named on some social media sites as Didar Al Mahmud (20), a student apparently studying at a Malaysian university.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst4oPWOHrOlyUWkUxHfE2VvmuuxOdA3j7zF8zKkKjjfrehIhle3aT9ervcvJP-YDJRwqgw0U70QVAE1dv4bRkR-BXXSJa-MUhGe3qDRcyWDB8bMXlGv3npP7TZWawkQmpatWerIiMq5hqwwOXAsYTHLXj56lYY7f9I9odMF8C0KlqdTQyXSiBKAc01WWdfM46MG756pb5vOJVp6oKFDmvuPY-pyIETnKRgjzfvvrY4Pj4uOwT0jHzqTi8Ap4nXnbEjMWIca2TO0byHS_VtZC2wk3m2-nbu5sP35tQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAQePZ2xSEABEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
