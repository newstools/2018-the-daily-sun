Benni will forever be called to the DC because that guy there, Mr Barker, only wants to collect money from the coaches.“I’m not sure about the SuperSport goal. What I know is that the linesman was late and it was probably not offside. What I can guarantee he was late not once, twice or three times, he was forever late.”De Sa made his comments to the media after his side played to a 1-1 draw against AmaZulu on 23 September last year saying Media should not only hold players and coaches to account but also officials.He said: “To be honest with you, every time we say something we get punished,” “It’s always the same coaches who say and we are the ones who are victimised. Not victimised straight away, even in future games they look for you and we all know that happens... we can’t run away from it.“The 16 coaches will have a go and we’ll be called in to DRCs and punished and fined and whatever. But you guys, reporters, you got a bigger and better say than us.“You see it all the time and you have a go at coaches, you have a go at players and why do you hold you back on this type of thing? I don’t know why. It’s like you got something around your neck but you see it.“If the field is bad you guys hammer the field. If the coach is bad you hammer the coach. If the player is bad you hammer the player, but I’m yet to see anything else, why? Hey? Seriously.“I see it all the time... all the time and no one has a go. And you know what, you are interviewing me about the decision he made... go and interview the expert.“They are so protected and untouchable, but it’s about time that some of these guys take responsibility for their actions on what it does for the livelihoods of many people, because they have a massive effect.“I understand mistakes... but come on guys. The stats are there... really how much more? I mean the worse thing about it, I said to him after the game, I said ‘Mr ref’, I actually said, ‘Victor, come on you can’t have a Gomes show every week’ and those are my exact words. Is that a red card?“I was actually giving him a bit of advice and he turned around and said, ‘no, it’s a red card and it’s ungentlemanly conduct’.” Like this story?
