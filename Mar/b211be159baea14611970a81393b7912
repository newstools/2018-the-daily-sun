We opted to stay put and pray. “My kids were crying hysterically.”The gogo said they could feel and hear a rumbling sound from the huge tree as it came crashing down.“We could hear the cracking and we held our breath. “The next thing we heard was a huge bang when the tree crashed on top of our shack. We were trapped but still holding hands.”Elizabeth said the tree missed her legs by mere centimetres.“I believe the prayer saved our lives,” she said. “God was on our side.”The tree also damaged four other shacks in the area. Ekurhuleni Disaster and Emergency Management Services spokesman William Ntladi said he was not aware of the incident. “We do not have any report that officials attended to that scene. It could be that it was never reported.“What we can confirm is that we did attend to a similar scene in Springs,” said Ntladi.
