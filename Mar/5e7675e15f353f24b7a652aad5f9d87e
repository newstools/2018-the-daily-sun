Transport Minister Blade Nzimande on Friday called for investigations into three horror crashes that left at least 31 people dead accumulatively. "We will leave no stone unturned to establish the causes of these crashes which claimed so many innocent lives," said Nzimande.  "The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) and the South African Police Service (SAPS) are conducting full mechanical investigations which involve determining the roadworthy status of the vehicles involved to establish if it contributed in any way to these crashes."READ: 14 dead in horror KwaZulu-Natal crashif(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstslEe35qh17amMTitGI57DgFEr0S_9eWhaMnYTwEypXy3vlYsVa3VgSekY1ZLigLyq7EAMAS92XeDTo2XeJ-cws6X2pbtVbq2vmGtFTJ1BAeixxicXIvmL24VCUflr5L334wqMWLBS0rY-PpDI-eLgsT9v7YgAg8TqEhL9CFr6xx9rSr4B0boYm-oxfhdAXzzwrWrcYiGqI8gno8QeUUEyGacseIY8dP3b64swZ-Qx3z7xRD8fgaf_Q6zeJ2Q8AHeshkZHZE5Iprd4jRKkYs9ggORKaNo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBjP4kkWt4ynEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
