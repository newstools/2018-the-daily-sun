THE South African Football Association (SAFA) and the National Executive Committee (NEC) have agreed to postpone the upcoming presidential elections.SAFA and the NEC met on on Tuesday to discuss issues surrounding the upcoming SAFA Elective Congress, which was scheduled to take place on on Saturday, March 24.According to SAFA's website, the NEC unanimously agreed to postpone the elections in order to address any issues that may impact the credibility of the Congress.The NEC meeting also resolved the following:- Postponing the elections would give the new Electoral Committee (EC) enough time to thrash out all compliance matters.- The EC must finalise all matters pertaining to the elections.- All Regions who have not fully completed their electoral process must do so urgently.- A Congress should be called up urgently to notify members about the above resolutions.- Individuals who take football cases to the courts of law must be reported to FIFA in line with the world football governing body and, where appropriate, SAFA should recommend that such individuals receive worldwide bans as per FIFA statutes.- Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana who lost his case in the courts on Tuesday, March 20 should be banned for life and that SAFA should start processes to recoup all money as a result of these court cases. The amounts run into millions of Rand.- SAFA writes a full report for FIFA on the above recommendations and on the way forward with regards to the elections.The new date for the elections will be announced shortly.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu0NiLSY9j73sEiZGVdDtydV7V60ZQj2c3JepuqkcXU2JSZNRvvFBKvNdhoojLXED72dSFu3EVYXC39HtPawTYMq5h3YjSmsLzmLc27AaOXs9wstmvDgISENUwQRaAziA5biN7-au-Zelf3hXc00et7XV4qMk0Eq478TxBzaNjLKpxRiJOm0tq2XRNcpRYMKm36MW3D1HlLzJXgpwnKHgL8_9VhPZXYNJ6ayAvssvGVvCfHJoOX89dzgbdHk690reSzdNJJ-Lh9VKwaEG1O\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCVEMTe-8IGHEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
