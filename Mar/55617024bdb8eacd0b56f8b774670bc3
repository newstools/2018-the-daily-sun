However, the 21-year-old from Phatsima outside Rustenburg, North West, claims she wasn’t allowed to see her daughter until the day after the birth. She found out then that the baby’s arm was broken! The furious mum told Daily Sun she felt the hospital had failed her. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuuBJE-JdA_Wb4dZLYOTRbeLM8BSgXEl90cL8wxlotouCQP_c7Cf6-GU9MSXWMsfkKDimynZNIj-JPwRJ4wWqGbC_Bd6DJmZERfyBbIQ4agLwFhc2D20YHIH8rRBYWz3qXrhW_y-jSzSypQlwOtykhYYy_fufQY0yjEcE-I6LJhqrs2Xt_m6nKPV0ZLKvOLLJTonklGRvzo9gZlZjQM0r4l4dU87NgR7kzooneJ4n2YzJ9pEvcL-YyeOX8TewmOv34IHTY7sjxtL2IzTNEQvoGbNh2CE2Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNDqjNd8zbCOEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

According to Lebogang, this was a lie as the doctor never even bothered to examine her after the delivery.“Why was I not informed about what had happened as the mum of the child? This makes me really angry,” she said. “I want the doctor and the hospital to come and explain to me how my baby’s arm was broken. “I want to know what happened.”Lebogang said the horrific experience she went through showed the hospital didn’t care about the people they treated. Lebogang’s uncle, Jacob Kobedi (49), said: “We want the hospital to take full responsibility for the damage caused by the doctor. “What they did and how they handled the situation doesn’t show any professionalism.” North West Health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said the matter was being investigated and would be properly followed up.
