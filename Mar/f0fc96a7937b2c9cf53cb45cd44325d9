THE Joburg Metro police has warned SunLanders to be aware of fake job adverts. This comes after a number of fake adverts for jobs in the department were circulated on social media. One of the adverts read: “The City of Joburg is looking for 1 500 enthusiastic, committed and brave men and women of the highest integrity to undergo an intense training programme where they will stand to become elite trainee members of the Metro police.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssiZE8m4Fm3fELE65QasSudqEqTUyam_gJJcBmTfIOHTQhpw0y502nrDoOTCuhsKfS_BiAsyGJeUX6Gq1jzB1TcjVauzvOyRYdpQq8Y3E0-URtoR4t_sXpMWfeaOpfAsSymeGisMBVGQhOeVp7svDxWa7v6HXqMQssR3Kz7XUW7y6Qnf15khF_trj-x2gfFzeASrxaOX7MP5gq_9RqnjM-OoIDFsYQ_jEllsTNQCdq9pbwH6UyplL6pdb3LMEXTH-i-WDCFWsAZM0XeABpuwaFOAEHRp9Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGSLScxBIS42EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar criticised the adverts and said there were no jobs. “There are no vacancies for training. The public is being cautioned against individuals with criminal intent who want to fleece money from young people desperate for work. “The advert will be investigated so the people responsible can be arrested.”
