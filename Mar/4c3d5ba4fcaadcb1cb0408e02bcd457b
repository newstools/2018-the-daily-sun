The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) have warned the public to be careful of two individuals scamming young people by promising them fake jobs at the organisation.It has been brought to the attention of the organisation that there are two individuals calling themselves Stephen and Sherinne who claim that they are working for the CSIR recruitment office and are looking for young people to hire."According to the information we have, Stephen finds young, job-seeking ladies on social media platforms then Sherinne contacts them for a “telephonic interview”, using a private number. After the interview, Stephen asks to meet with the “candidate” at a certain location, where he demands sex in order to secure the “job”, David Mandaha, CSIR Media Manager.Mandaha said the CSIR, as an accountable and transparent employer, wishes to warn the public about this scam. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssLPuCPxKpNxjd9Vm8Am-Bcw7Vnp9cZq7biNpKp2yKBFUWCKLj_jHfkzxr7ctF-cyVeyBKxat16hOnjksfE_rqTVGCEsheWskgsD5nTl5W7IdBryW3eXF9z3mBwpx1pd2GInhsyiBgqI3wr2xCB39nPdJrs7-SQUcS8AmOo90GqMt2H6JrVoz9AXRLNqt_lf9vsiEhfhF3nttYXGJsjoIiSalhRo6zJBMZdPMMrFpYOnXNbbR3vUxbslf87_6cNa0MnX-ecFKU_coiCwnj1ezJkG-E3bHY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKRsvdnDHA1CEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
