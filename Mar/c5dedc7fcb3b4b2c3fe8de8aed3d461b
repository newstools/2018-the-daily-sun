Zandisiwe told Daily Sun she chose to live life to the full, regardless of her condition.She said even though she has faced many challenges, she kept on going. “I first enrolled for the degree in 2014, but I had to quit as I struggled to get equipment to assist me with my studies. “I returned in 2016 when I heard there were amendments made to accommodate students with sight problems.“I managed to progress well with my studies because of specialised computers and cellphone apps,” she told the People’s Paper.Zandisiwe said she doesn’t wear spectacles because medical specialists told her they wouldn’t help.“Even though I don’t wear spectacles, I regularly consult my optometrist for treatment.” She said she had been diagnosed with glaucoma, a genetic condition that causes damage to the optic nerves which transmit images to the brain.“When I look at something, it’s as if I am peeping through a very tiny dark hole. “I have accepted my condition and I’m grateful to my family for their support,” said Zandisiwe.“I always tell other people living with disabilities that there are no limitations in life.”
