And Tau has been in a league of his own since the beginning of the season. Addressing media in the Nedbank Cup quarter final press conference Mosimane stated there there’s no player in the league right now that can compete with the 23-year-old Mpumalanga born player.Mosimane said: "For me‚ you can't compare Percy to anybody. Give it to him. He's playing Champions League‚ excuse me - and scoring. He's scoring for Bafana."He's scoring in the league‚ he's scoring in the Nedbank Cup. Every time he scores. Who do you want to compare him to? No‚ let's be honest."For us Tau is performing. I mean he's got assists‚ he scores. I don't know how you look at it because I was listening to SuperSport 4 two weeks ago. What is this‚ on Monday - Extra Time."People were campaigning for who's going to be player of the year. Unbelievable - people have got agendas‚ it's not funny."Just give it to Percy‚ please. He's playing for your country man. He's doing it at the highest level‚ week in and week out‚ every three days‚ running‚ playing‚ the same level."You can't compare it to well-rested teams. No ways. Get the same stress‚ run the same race."You can't study mathematics at lower grade and then you want to compare the person who's studying on higher grade. No. What is that?Mosimane also weighed in his opinion on the coach of the season saying Maritzburg United mentor Fadlu David’s deserves it.“Fadlu Davids is winning coach of the year”"For me‚ how many times have I won it - I think Fadlu should get it. I have Champions League to fight for. Caf‚ fighting with the Florent Ibenges (AS Vita coach)"I mean really. Now I'm fighting with Fadlu Davids to win (in SA). Do I really need that? I don't need that."He deserves it. He's a top coach. And I've said it before. Watch him‚ he's coming up very well""So Fadlu deserves it. We know about the campaigns but we are focused on the Champions League."We have bigger fish to fry. Some things we don't really focus on."
