He tried to push the race as hard as he could and another young boy tried to take the lead. I hope to run 28:40 in Valencia. “I’m happy I still have that sprint at my age. I just need to work hard on my speed to make sure my endurance is good.”Mzazi said he didn’t have enough in the tank to hang on to his lead. “I tried to beat him, but he had lot of strength in the last 300m. We train on the same track. I’m happy with second position. Mokoka is in a league of his own,” said Mzazi.
