KAIZER Chiefs hopes of clinching the Absa Premiership title took a big knock on Saturday night when they were held to a goalless draw by AmaZulu at FNB Stadium.The result was Chiefs 12th draw of the season, they joined the long list of teams who have played more than 10 draws this season which includes baroka FC, and Chippa United.Steve Komphela's side came closest to breaking the deadlock in Jo'burg, but Teenage Hadebe saw his header pushed onto the woodwork by Energy Murambadoro in the first half.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvzCbr3BJG-Fswf99dUVU0Bb7Cgxnbj3TWBzsjicQ-0636_Y9wp6lgn8o0f7pHXALg0-MHQgbhsmeGThBn18OZd8OCZECrP0qCH592qa5BMh_AdT723ZWROi4mF0hRefniJ4cOWMhz3FBtl7MXkwfxe4U78fYjWvx7ENz1DDPcDNzNsKs-QFTe4IQIcT0s8S3KIW62UvZ78oshEPX2RG8uglti_jBjSJSfna6DUNHmsnwzvqssybIgDlPBwy4vXgBsaBSr4H0lA4Wwz3RHYBPG0Yg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGMa9YNGuuBpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
