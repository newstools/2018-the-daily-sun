CONTROVERSIAL Pastor Penuel Mnguni was allegedly denied entry into Botswana on Thursday. Mnguni, known as the snake pastor, was apparently travelling with his wife and their three-year-old daughter when they were denied access to Sir Seretse Khama International Airport. It is believed he was supposed to take part in a church crusade event that started last week and ended yesterday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstyLP0fzyOIv9dVwu4HQ8zB2G14ReyPZyGkvCJtJ7AnyBd-XRcWaMYYBpiv3zMIkEARN6SG3SY9XsZqVrIgw1rmmMh-2J3XZMN510utQPGloayJ-CSEhe3Qw3FnDBsp22ElMoO0n2R5W7Zjl0D3lFdnfwOSnS4eSJpM8g-u5Ta7sIbwPERS4sKlsXky_rRtUoeie_-8jm5qrl89rddAJfY7-CZq178GGPO4ej3fFOSgLDUiucoELtBMLn0WTEBX2UkwVa2po-RhK0UM6O58Ikj1_KrsFIk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM6Gx6_iquGPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

In a video posted on the church’s Facebook page, the pastor said he was not angry with the Botswanan government. “God is still the Lord in what we are going through.“Government is not behind this but evil people are behind it,” he said.When the SunTeam contacted the church, a man who refused to be named said he couldn’t comment as the church was preparing for a special service for the pastor’s birthday. Botswana’s Minister of Immigration Affairs Edwin Bathu said a pastor from South Africa was on a visa requirement list, meaning he needs to apply to enter the country, but he could not confirm whether it was Mnguni. “I am not aware of anyone who has been sent away from the country and I cannot confirm if the person that has allegedly been turned away is the one listed for the visa requirement,” he said.
