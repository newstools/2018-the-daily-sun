He said she was in and out of contracts.Speaking to Daily Sun, Marah said she was not bitter, even though some people had labelled her a diva.“I have been in the industry since 1968 when I was still at high school. I have never in my life taken a call contract,” she said. “I’m a professional and I will never allow people who run companies to take advantage of me because I’m desperate for a job.”On Sunday she posted a letter online which showed her contract was terminated in September.“People must understand I posted that letter to prove I didn’t leave the show because I had other plans.“I was forced out but I’m not bitter about it.“I understand there are people who are saying whatever they like about me, but the truth is I was unfairly treated. When you feel there is unhappiness in your workplace, the best solution is to leave.”Marah said she would be back on TV screens soon as she was working on new projects.When the SunTeam tried to get comment, a secretary at Ferguson Films said Shona and Connie Ferguson were unavailable as they were on set.
