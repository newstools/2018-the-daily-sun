The municipality is currently charging families R950 if they want to keep their relatives’ graves untouched.Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said they’ve received several complaints about graves being recycled without the family members’ consent. She also criticised the municipality for charging families who want to protect the dignity of their dead loved ones. She said the policy, which was implemented a few years ago, discriminated against families who couldn’t afford to pay this fee.Responding to the commission, the mayor said the municipality had a shortage of land to build houses, let alone to bury people. Gumede said people were squashed into houses and now also squeezed into grave sites as well. But Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, who was accompanied by commissioner David Mosoma, said the shortage was caused by poor planning.They said with proper planning, the municipality could have foreseen the shortage and secured more land.The commission also listened to a Nazareth Baptist Church presentation about teachers who continued to force pupils who are members of the church to cut their hair. The commission warned the KZN government representatives who were present to tell Premier Willies Mchunu to intervene because his office could also be taken to court. The commission will return on 25 April.
