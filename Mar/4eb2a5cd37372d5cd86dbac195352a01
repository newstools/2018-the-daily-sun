DOES the 30-point mark truly represent safety for relegation-haunted clubs in the Absa Premiership? When the going gets tough, struggling clubs usually set themselves the target of getting at least 30 points to sustain their top flight status.And the system worked in the past two seasons – for Bloemfontein Celtic last season and for Polokwane City in 2015-16.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssW8oaBkOyNXjUJWrHJ1M7Ka45pbce_M2MZI9Z4YJ3gwppK3NWhbuIetkPT-MNqmfqtixFIj46g-3jQ4w2Jm2jAtUbXhopMiZKrBcXhyM7r_3JPl3-9-QtSNUn1paOJJKtuX0xWc8vcEkVIAIr89mfWcubgUzeA_PsOxC2Pm-vpvfdm_NGNI3r7te6nHVqS7OYmmKC5i67hDQJD4nRKPcvc7jRWvyFOpErR1-9cfstaLIAVxiA0nY7gOEhEShVyVhlqmMUF-IxSa1-23t7Y\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJ3Pj86acJiEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

AmaZulu, who are in 11th place, will host struggling Ajax in a fight for survival at King Zwelithini Stadium next Tuesday (7.30pm).Said Johnson: “There has been a lot of draws and that has created a bottleneck at the top and at the bottom. This season more than 30 points will be necessary for any team from position nine to the bottom team to be safe.”Usuthu have not been at their best since the beginning of the season and are now in danger of becoming one of the two teams set to be relegated at the end of the season. “In the remaining fixtures we won’t underestimate anyone. We must find our balance and aim at getting something from the next six games.”Johnson added: “The Ajax game won’t be easy, it is more like a 15-pointer for me – six is an underestimation. The more effort we put into this game the better for us.”AmaZulu came from 2-0 down to steal a point when they drew 2-2 at Athlone Stadium in their first round encounter.
