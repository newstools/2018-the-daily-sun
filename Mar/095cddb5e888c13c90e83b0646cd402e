Without that certificate, you’re not allowed to handle or sell food,” she said. “You can apply, and an environmental health practitioner will come and inspect your premises to ensure that you adhere to requirements.”She also said the city was inspecting stalls where food was sold to see if they met the requirements.“We look at whether you have access to running water, access to smooth, clean surfaces that are non-absorbent, and if your premises are easy to clean. We check if there are ablution facilities within a hundred metres of where you’re operating and if you have access to personal protective equipment,” she said.Phalatse said traders not complying with the city’s health regulations would be shut down.She mentioned that one of the ways to transmit infection included coming into contact with contaminated food and then touching other food.“We emphasise washing of hands every time after going to the toilet or handling raw meat or even after touching your face.”She said the department would continue to talk to traders and educate them on how to approach their businesses.
