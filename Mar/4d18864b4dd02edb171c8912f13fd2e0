Lindiwe Nzuzo, Nedbank’s Nomzamo branch manager, said they were aware of the syndicate.“They arrive at about 6am when the branch is still closed and there’s no security. People are easy targets at that time as they are rushing.”She advised people to withdraw cash at supermarkets. The centre’s manager, Abongile Sotiya, said the matter was brought to their attention and they consulted with the banks.“Some of the banks don’t have an effective ways to stop this. They showed us video clips of people being robbed and it’s out of control.”Police Captain Frederick van Wyk said people have not reported thefts to the police.“We would like to advise the community to report such incidents.”
