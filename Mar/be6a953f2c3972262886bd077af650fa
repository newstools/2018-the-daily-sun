A KENYAN neurosurgeon is in deep kak after mistakenly cutting
open the skull of the wrong patient.According to Daily Nation, the hospital horror happened
last Sunday at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi.Two men had been wheeled into the hospital with head
injuries. Scans showed that one had a blood clot in his brain, which needed to
be surgically removed.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsucqaZu_K1KMBPQ3UcBs9lip54cJo9fGP07ZoTDnVRqWGd_YNPEBajX3ASHZF22QfnB_098dVU99rDB15c5XX3E-1kpdPYjG8OuVCkUwRe8Jtyc-mSIDPvUNQkPiJAAHitHZwDojYnir44GO49hqqU7Fik-8tQCTn3q-lLWzzVsywb2OqYvGoQywbG4zZKrp_vFGbNy6SSRos6j8Z3tm8ECh5Zk0QSNBiBdcIxYtVGzqbXAAxO04HLS_1DjETaWeboTE4A2fHOrFFcRPlZPBzllknmia3eFF0kMdw\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YRUlMW_B6nVdRuDr2cRqrYL_y7RLlL-Z0jlPRGLCfVnstKcMR2tzJ3mt4CaEfo8slEdfwGWPzXRiA796JPIDgwk24Se2wM4wN2AaLie\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMfWDyvngLppEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

needed care and medication to heal.But a horror mix-up of identification tags on the two
patients resulted in the wrong man being wheeled into theatre and having his
skull cut open.It was only two hours into the operation when the doctors
couldn’t find the blood clot that they realised they were operating on the
wrong man.Miraculously, the man wrongly operated on is said to be
recovering, while the man with the clot has reportedly improved so much that he
might not need surgery afterall.All hell has now let loose on the pre-surgery procedures
in Kenyan hospitals that can allow such a blunder to occur.The hospital’s chief operating officer Lily Koros issued
a statement announcing the suspension of the neurosurgeon, the ward nurse,
theatre receiving nurse, and the anaesthetist who were at work on the fateful
night, said the Daily Nation.
