It's by far my best album. Might even be my last one,” the rapper tweeted.Of course, one must take AKA’s tweets with a pinch of salt since he is somewhat known to use his Twitter account to stir up some publicity when he has something new to release.The 30-year-old rapper is set to release his third studio album, Touch My Blood later this year.He has been in the music game for over seven years now with somewhat of a tumultuous journey in the spotlight.Despite his undeniable mega star status, AKA has broken numerous records and has set the bar for many South African and even African rappers.But his career has often been clouded by scandal and a few Twitter meltdowns.So whether or not he will actually quit the music industry is something we all have to wait and see.
