The truth is, I struggle to get into a relationship in South Africa because I’m afraid of why somebody will be getting in a relationship with me or why I’m getting into a relationship with them. I can’t even play with someone because, for me, it’s like, who are they gonna tell, am I a trophy, and there are all these other things I need to think of,” she said.Pearl says she is now looking outside of Mzansi for love.“I’m still optimistic but I’ve decided to open up the borders and keep my mind open and keep my relationship opportunities quite democratic in terms of race. One thing I’ve learned is, if I’m not a hundred percent, I can’t expect to be completed by somebody else, I want for us to create fireworks as two complete people who are going to make the world a better place,” Pearl shared.
