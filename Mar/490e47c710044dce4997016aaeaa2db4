But for this mission to be complete I need her family to come forward so I can meet them.”Vusumuzi said his gift came from Shembe. In 2014, Daily Sun told the story of Vusumuzi, who helped a family who believed their house was haunted and they have not had a problem since.“I don’t want money. I help people for free,” he said.Katlehong police spokesman, Captain Mega Ndobe told Daily Sun the community had cleaned the house in 2013 but since then no one has lived in the house.“I can’t confirm the story but the house has been empty for a long time.“The windows and doors have all been stolen,” he said.
