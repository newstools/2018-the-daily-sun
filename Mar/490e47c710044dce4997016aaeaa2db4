THE SunTeam accompanied Vusumuzi Mkhwanazi (56) when he went to release the tormented spirit of a dead woman in an abandoned house in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni.Vusumuzi, a Shembe church member, said he was told by people that a man had killed his wife in the house, cut her into pieces and stored her remains in the fridge. “Neighbours told me when people move into the house they don’t stay long before packing their bags and going,” he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssk8nx_-kOeDh_6b0uXPNjRLiOEbxVwk_jYnpGPSaeAU8igPCXNbSpWzBwICh75GgH6rbfWFrqy0loK9kTNEenWpPh10ZQ8XIlvuaKZo0-JDWzeCDrxgHYSTbBZNyYOzyh2nq_Zqu4qf-uF7eCBhUYhHskANhSqUB9-ObwN-Ionq4HG17WMLnRWPXSVqoUUDAKtH4ob6LtoNnRozS3hN4W6YZkPcZx31eIoeo2j0eN5iJodU02T1ZkR5SAuPS9UH_LogV2apiraZE6ghN1HcQ8YhjcDsBg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAEtdtzWc6KFEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But for this mission to be complete I need her family to come forward so I can meet them.”Vusumuzi said his gift came from Shembe. In 2014, Daily Sun told the story of Vusumuzi, who helped a family who believed their house was haunted and they have not had a problem since.“I don’t want money. I help people for free,” he said.Katlehong police spokesman, Captain Mega Ndobe told Daily Sun the community had cleaned the house in 2013 but since then no one has lived in the house.“I can’t confirm the story but the house has been empty for a long time.“The windows and doors have all been stolen,” he said.
