You see it in the dance, you see it in the art and you certainly see it on the football pitch. Only Brazilians play this way."Brazil's away kit is blue, drawing inspiration from the first time they wore the colour, in 1958 against Sweden. The top's pattern involves a star, referring to the first winner's star Brazil received after lifting their first ever World Cup in 1958.  1/3
