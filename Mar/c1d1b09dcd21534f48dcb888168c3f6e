Freedom Under Law lawyer Wim Trengove told the Constitutional Court yesterday that he wanted the settlement agreement between Zuma and Nxasana to be declared unlawful and invalid.He told the court that Zuma first tried to bully Nxasana by threatening him with a public inquiry. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsur8vF35pM-q3axHHqdcNU2nKtAlq6PXBk4oz_f92ZkeNYsSMw3fErXH01a8nodr8knPP-dR3DsNMHQ-tRCS9ftofKi8kcDs5xLUZWdaWxd1LpqGeTxM2lYLfuTrQ93yraTqJJfxAzs-P0Oh-DZB4pDugbmJqi36plt9aOpyzHNYlHUIAVVVQAe9x5D2PR4nyXWCzSLyQ_L7QAaGN0bbQi7OEdjClMsKz3mZU0Btj94dHjgppbHjCpjnnLAGZ5KalYCAYfdOUYKlUWJQ3QL27ZR1_XcZXk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPyFH4aWpP1VEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

On 8 December, the North Gauteng High Court declared the decision by Zuma to terminate Nxasana’s appointment invalid.Trengove said the appointment of Shaun Abrahams was part of Zuma’s plan to get rid of Nxasana. Advocate Matthew Chaskalson, who represented non-profit organisation Corruption Watch, told the court that Nxasana was a “victim of constructive removal”.“Nxasana didn’t want to go,” argued Chaskalson.Advocate Michelle le Roux, Nxasana’s lawyer, said her client was undermined and threatened with suspension for doing his job.Le Roux said Nxasana’s settlement was unlawful and told the court he was willing to pay it back.
