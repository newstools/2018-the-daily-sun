KALAWA JAZMEE is not going anywhere. It’s the longest running independent black-owned record label that’s been here for more than two decades.

 These were the words of Zynne “Mahoota” Sebika and Oscar “Oskido” Mdlongwa, who both said the record label had been around for 24 years.They poured cold water on rumours that Kalawa’s artists were jumping ship and the empire was crumbling.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuRtQaARUG6isx9OTgBTgHITpXrvP4otAdvUF48dtCTjv9tcHNLTXv04j5u3u5Z-z_Uu3xtwr89jJG5EZJOnw0BNiJPUV7gO9j4OliRbrbfIdRjG6wDWuJ8X1a3iQ-86XToJMd6OcOVvTLGBxKGheLKKW_S5TYJbqG5CZq4iQqT91ClQVYGGISitrDoADdMp0-RnZ7fQsfcCDz6--Seox_AO8lDA8zRScVvjCNsGD2uBO-AA_kbFlmoLzivDu_P6l02vrq_auli2q-_hBbSldbzDQrBZ3o\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAXZigq3RJruEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

This is where we prepare them for whatever path they’ll choose in the future.”According to Mahoota, the rumours “aren’t even to be entertained” because artists who had been with Kalawa knew they could do their own thing.Insisted Bruce: “We actually expect growth from everyone working with Kalawa.“We’ve been a home to many artists, including Boom Shaka, Mafikizolo, Alaska, Bongo Maffin, Zonke, Black Coffee, Big Nuz, Thebe, Black Motion, Durban Nyts, Maphorisa and Heavy K.“Most of these artists are household names and we still have great relationships with them. That’s why anytime we have something and we ask them, they actually come through for the company, no bad blood at all.”The duo said the music industry had changed a lot recently, but insisted Kalawa’s catalogue, which “remains one of the biggest” wasn’t for sale to anyone.“We can identify talent, know how to nurture talent and turn an artist into a brand,” Mahoota said.“We aren’t a fly-by-night record label and there’s no reason to keep too many artists in the stable as the strategy of running things has changed.”Oskido said downsizing was a global phenomenon because music sales weren’t what they used to be.He said Kalawa was working on a Bongo Maffin album to be released later in the year.Said Oskido: “Nokwazi, Spikiri and Candy are in the studio and Kalawa Jazmee is also working on other projects that’ll be good for the brand and take it to new heights.“We don’t have to sign new artists every year and Kalawa is a brand that’s stood the test of time.”
