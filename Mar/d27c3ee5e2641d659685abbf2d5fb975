AMAZULU are looking to end their cup drought when they take on National First Division (NFD) outfit Ubuntu Cape Town in a Nedbank Cup round of 16 match at King Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi tonight (8pm). Usuthu last won a domestic cup 26 years ago with a famous 3-1 victory over Kaizer Chiefs in the Coca-Cola Cup (now known as the Telkom Knockout). The closest they came to winning their second cup was back in 2010 when they lost 3-0 to Bidvest Wits in the final of the Ke Yona Cup. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvqZRXU1I-3MP_b0q7n4BNrgrLVnHufKtVY2HtDHTFJ1LgVrgzd9PrYVfGlyoz_Sk2UQ5EP3_jKllQ8NMMamSzJrBrLbuSSYieU_tk_31Rd4_XkfbiXDD8kDkzy9x7hH38CF6g5ndIJhGA0b7RbAC3KVKJMSeNDsU4UKTgwI9VXAasWCKS8YYMWyxsJlKvXDKe9UFXZDGhY4U4qID4vRv9QipxPXWhnJvZXX8H0yi-WgnQIXDl9Q8AjQLukcVMJclFwSrrS3mmC6twjozXtbwau0g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOZwGmfGo7lbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

All I know is that I want to see my team play in the cup final. I believe in my players, they are capable of going all the way. In every game we look to improve on the previous one.”In the round of 32 AmaZulu could only beat Bush Bucks 3-0 on penalties in a match that ended 2-2 after extra time, while Ubuntu beat Polokwane City 3-2.Usuthu are not the only KwaZulu-Natal team in action this weekend. Neighbours Maritzburg United visit NFD side Royal Eagles in a Pietermaritzburg derby at Princess Magogo Stadium on Sunday, while Richards Bay FC are away to Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr Molemela Stadium on the same day. Both games start at 3.30pm. Like this story?
