Cops monitored the people, who sang struggle songs in front of the gates of various companies and factories. Tshiamo Baloyi, an ANCYL treasurer in ward 6, said there is economic activity around Mamelodi, but residents are poor. She said local companies are closing down because they are not supported by big businesses. “Labour brokers are also stealing from our people. They should stop, and companies must hire workers full time,” said Baloyi.“ There are ‘No Jobs’ signs on their gates, but people from other areas are hired through labour brokers. It’s about time that we participated in the economic activity in our area.” Pupil Malerato Moloi (18) said companies should adopt local schools. She said their parents were being underpaid by stores and factories. “They should give us bursaries because our parents cannot afford higher education with their salaries.” A factory manager said: “Most of the people who work here in Samcor Park are from Mamelodi. “We support local schools and NGOs,” he said. “It is sad that political parties will go to such lengths to stay in the papers.”
