The victim was driving his old Toyota Cressida when he was attacked by unknown people in a Mercedes-Benz. At the scene of the murder, a resident, Xolani Msibi (40) told the SunTeam the situation was so bad they had become used to seeing taxi owners lying dead. “People don’t value other people’s lives these days,” he said. Xolani said people were suffering when it came to transport. “Taxis from one of the associations were banned from using Sontonga Road. “Now we have to walk 10km to get transport in another section,” he said. “There are many people using public transport. We really need them to stop fighting,” he said. Police Captain Buyisile Mvelase confirmed a taxi owner had been killed by unknown suspects. She said the police suspected it was related to taxi violence as several similar cases have been opened since last year.
