Clearly, the League results achieved have not been up to the standards we set for ourselves.“We have 17 consecutive top 8 finishes under our belt, so to be in the position we currently find ourselves is not easy to accept. We believe in the group of players we have, in their playing ability as well as their desire to fight for the club.“We wish Eric well in the future and thank him for his contribution in adding the MTN8 trophy to our cabinet, during his short spell at the club.”Tinkler said: “I believe we can turn things around but the only way of getting out of our current position is to have a fully unified and committed response from the players and I haven’t been able to get that from them, so it seems best for all parties that we part ways.Last season Tinkler lead Cape Town City to third place on theor first season in the Absa Premiership.Hi then jumped ship to join SuperSport in June replacing Stuart Baxter who became Bafana Bafana coach.Under his watchful eye SuperSport reached the 2017 Caf Confederation Cup final, where they lost against TP Mazembe.But their league form has since suffered as they are currently occupying position 12 after 22 League games. And they were knocked out in the first round of Nedbank Cup by Bloemfontein CeltiC.
