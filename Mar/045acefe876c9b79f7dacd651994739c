Some face charges of malicious damage to property and assault following a revenge attack.Operation Kolomaka was launched on Thursday and 21 people were arrested for dealing and possession of drugs, as well as contravention of the Sexual Offences Act.According to Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone, the arrest followed an intensive investigation in February into drug dealing and brothels operating from residences in Rustenburg and Tlhabane.“Cocaine with an estimated street value of R400 000 and R53 000 were seized from the suspects,” he told the People’s Paper. Four vehicles worth R550 000 were confiscated.The suspects, including a woman, appeared in the Rustenburg Magistrates Court on Friday.The matter was postponed to next Tuesday. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane urged community members to work with the police to expose criminals, instead of taking the law into their own hands.
