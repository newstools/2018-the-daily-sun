We really want to know how we can benefit from what the president said because business is tough.” He wants small businesses to get funding from government to boost their capital.“When we buy cows’ heads from suppliers, they tell us they get them from Saldanha Bay, so they charge us petrol money. “For our businesses to grow, government needs to subsidise the transport of cows’ heads so they don’t charge us so much,” he said.Fumanekile said they buy the heads for R120 each, R20 more than last year. He said when he started in 2016, a cow head cost about R80.“I make around R250 from one head but my profit decreases every time the suppliers increase their prices.”
