They said it will be worse as winter approaches.Ntokozo Maphanga (32) said her grade 2 son arrives home tired every day.“He’s always complaining that his back is painful,” said Ntokozo. “He told me he had to sit on a bucket because there weren’t enough chairs.”The matter was posted to Facebook by Siphumelele Zondi, a concerned resident who asked her social media friends for desk and chair donations.She posted a photo of a pupil sitting on a bucket and another sitting on a school bag. Some of those who commented promised to donate.Busie Hlophe commented: “I’ll donate five chairs. Please send banking details.”The SunTeam contacted Siphumelele, who said she was accompanying a parent to the school last month when she saw a pupil sitting on a bucket.“I then checked other classrooms and saw pupils sitting on their school bags,” she said. “I took photos and posted them to Facebook so other users would see and maybe donate,” she said.KZN education spokesman S’celo Khuzwayo said he had seen the Facebook post, and the department had worked hard to deliver school furniture. He said they relied on parents to inform them of shortages.The department would look into the matter as it had not received a report.
