THE families of the dead whose graves were violated will be reburying their loved ones with sadness.  The corpses were dug up last year in Tshitavha and Folovhodwe villages, outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo. This came to light after a 17-year-old girl told members of the community she and her boyfriend stole body parts from the cemetery and sold them to traditional healers. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuz-CgNc3qKRfK8sloyVLB6IV9dzFRaKzE0EY6nvexQKP8-Rod9RzdXG7gAdFMj28tDzpbstUXbyxboGZtcYNQ_PCeci7jSDEGlAf6MGHjY3A3J1qxL5jFvHPP1YsxzRPDBO7kuACgdAFjZainBHs_IANtLD0eCj9GNMGdyCKk-rLwSgj5fP8Y7UciK0lod73f5XQuHT-tC-Y97swyU1Pa3UDzUDzuinyNS4zLL1rmLq0B-4EsTTeuPZwi8Y4uRA8x84Wgc3FSg5q9Co05Glo1IhSo4adE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP7O_iN7KiNiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The remains left behind by the grave robbers were taken for forensic tests and returned to the families yesterday.However, some families were unhappy that some of their loved ones’ body parts were still missing.The family of Alpheus Phundulu (71), who was buried in 2007, was particularly unhappy. His grave was found to be completely empty and his remains were never recovered. His son Fhatuwani said: “We had hoped police would make a breakthrough but my father’s body is still missing. The robbers know where he is and the police should do their job.” Mulalo Vhudzikadzika, whose father Alpheus’ head was found to be missing, said his family is having sleepless nights. “We need our father’s head so we can bury his full body,” he said. Traditional healers Erick Kwinda (49), Avhapfani Nemungadi (42), Daniel Nephawe (23) and Colbert Nemasisi (29) and high school pupil Mathadzhila Munyai (20) were arrested for allegedly stealing and selling body parts. They are due to stand trial in July.
