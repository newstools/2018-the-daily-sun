Our bodies have many ways of telling us that something might
be wrong. Here are eight instances when you should listen to your penis.Trouble down below may indicate health issues elsewhere.
Listen up: your penis is trying to tell you something.1. You’re going soft more than you care to admitif(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Limping into the bedroom more than twice a month may mean
your heart’s just not in it: an Austrian study found that the risk of
developing heart disease within 10 years was 65% higher in men with moderate or
severe erectile dysfunction than in men without ED.“Blood vessels in the penis are significantly smaller and
start to narrow long before those in the heart or brain,” says urologist Dr
Darius Paduch. Talk to your doctor, who can refer you to a cardiologist.2. Your pee has gone from yellow to redPink bowl? Red flag. “Blood can be a sign of prostate,
bladder or kidney disease, so you need to find out where the blood is coming
from,” says Kevin Billups, MD, an associate professor of urology at Johns
Hopkins Medicine.On the other hand, bloody semen during sexual activity is
less likely to signal deadly danger, says urologist Dr Eric Klein. Still, ask
your doctor to check it out.You could have prostatitis, a gland inflammation that’s
often caused by an E. coli infection. If that’s the case, it can be treated
with antibiotics.3. Your sex drive is stuck in neutralIs the fire dying in bed? Could be OSA. Obstructive sleep
apnoea, a sleep disorder in which your airway becomes blocked, might be
reducing your sex drive. German researchers found that men with the lowest
levels of night-time blood oxygen reported sexual desire levels 11% lower than
men who breathed easily.OSA can reduce testosterone, affecting your erections. If
you snore loudly, wake up gasping for air or feel exhausted during the day, ask
your doctor about OSA testing.4. You see that the tip is red and swollenNo, not that type of swollen. We mean inflammation, redness
and pain at the head of your willy. It’s called balanitis, and it’s typically
caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, often as a result of less-than-stellar
hygiene, Dr Paduch says.You may need an over-the-counter antifungal, a prescription
steroid cream or antibiotics. Then get checked for diabetes: research from
Bristol-Myers Squibb shows that people with diabetes are nearly three times as
likely as non-diabetics to develop balanitis.5. You notice it doesn’t feel as sensitive as beforeA numb knob could be a sign of poor diet. Each day, make
sure you consume at least 2.4 micrograms of vitamin B12, from such sources as
milk or beef, and 400 micrograms of folate, found in leafy greens.“A deficiency in these vitamins can prevent nerve fibres in
your penis from carrying signals to your brain,” says Dr Paduch.Next, have your blood sugar tested to rule out diabetes.
Even a mildly high level –  above 100
mg/dL after eight hours of fasting – can impact penile sensitivity, says Dr
Paduch.6. You have to urinate more often than usualThe likely cause of your plumbing problem is benign
prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, a condition that rarely causes symptoms before
age 40 but affects up to 90% of men in their seventies and eighties.When your prostate is enlarged, it presses on the tube that
carries urine out of your body, giving you that persistent “got to go” feeling.
Your doctor may prescribe alpha-blockers, pills that help BPH (and sometimes
high blood pressure) by relaxing the smooth muscles in your prostate.7. You produce less ejaculate or can’t orgasmSputtering when you should be spurting? Low T could be the
culprit.“Testosterone helps produce semen, and the more semen you
have, the more force you ejaculate with,” Dr Paduch says. The cause of your
trouble may also be lurking in your medicine cabinet: about one-third of men
who take selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression
experience difficulty reaching orgasm, according to researchers in Iran. Ask
your doctor whether you should change the dose or switch medication.8. Your erection is curving at a strange angleYou may be among the up to 23% of men aged 40 and up who get
Peyronie’s disease, a condition that makes an erect penis bend at an angle of
30 degrees or more. It strikes when collagen plaques form on the connective
tissue surrounding the spongy interior of the penis.The cause may be genetic or a sign of too much (or too
little) sexual activity. Seek treatment within 24 hours, and consider a blood
sugar test. High glucose levels alter stem cells in your penis, encouraging
plaque to form.SOURCE: HEALTH24
