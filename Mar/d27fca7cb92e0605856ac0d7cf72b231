The association last week released a statement claiming Jordaan enjoys 52 nominations, of the 53 regions, while Ncobo is backed by one.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuiffofMyDNaOegfPiecwazWhXnoR6gZMdRVXZ0FCBQ2zAMx0OeZ-iZ-Wu5QRgxRwMF_quPQFgqcJx2jOF8mLiuJMXPd6Jg5Z4h3ha_CpAlH6Bo8LP5kbxDd_tguDkbn0xYB9kV8zjiQm7Dkciae-uiGF8STsUa_9EtUzRZAIINdgujlkDpl379ZB4jHsaUZvG8A5IESIkgGR5KFGWv79ojrk6bGMcBuPi5Bg8mEjHAPmT4fCaYPmHa6A25XfXnuYZCWXyle22qX2xdpQGC\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzI49N3M6h-FKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Safa can still appoint their own electoral commission to run their elections, but SunSport understands that the process might take over six months, as they would need 30 days or more to convene a Congress to elect the electoral committee.But Safa said they “believe strongly that the IEC’s action is unethical and unprofessional and shall pursue legal action against it”. On the other hand, there is also Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana who has apparently approached the courts to stop the Elective Congress.Safa argues that  the process of nominations by their members was completed “and the list of candidates for the Office of the President of the Association was circulated to Members on 3 March 2018”.Furthermore, which could make things difficult for Safa, is that their Auditor just released details, which were forwarded to the IEC “to enable the vetting of candidates”.It now remains to be seen if Safa’s outside Auditors KPMG will wait until the new date of the Elective Congress, should they be delayed according to Ncobo’s wishes.KPMG will apparently end their relationship with Safa at the end of the month.Safa had invited  Fifa and the Confederation of African Football (Caf) to oversee the congress, failure to which will be an embarrassment to the association and the ex-mayor. It is however difficult to talk to Jordaan with enquiries about the 2010 Fifa World Cup CEO referred to his campaign body Football Transformation Forum (FTF).
