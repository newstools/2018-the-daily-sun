Government will have to pay the owner of the land because we’re not going to stop,” said the leader of the land grabbers. “They’ve destroyed our shacks now, but we’ll come back stronger and ready to fight.”The residents said they were backyarders who were tired of paying landlords exorbitant rentals. Thumeka Manjalima (33) said: “We want land to build our own houses, that’s all. We need a decent place for our kids.”City of Cape Town MMC for informal settlements, water and waste services Councillor Xanthea Limberg, said 182 new structures were removed on Saturday.“The city has a court order in place and laid a charge of trespassing. The site is being monitored,” she said.The land grabbers insisted they were not going to give up and plan to protest on the N2 this week.
