He said most of the families are still angry over what happened and the fact that the government had failed to compensate the families.“We are happy that the Mpumalanga provincial government saw it fit to make this memorial service for our brothers,” he said. “However, we still need proper closure.“We feel like the government let us down because they knew what to do but ignored us.” Milcharles said they were promised compensation which was never paid.“We want to be compensated and taken for counselling. We would also like the victims’ children to be provided with bursaries,” he said.The event was attended by Deputy Minister of International Relations Reginah Mhaule and Mpumalanga’s MEC for Sports, Arts and Culture Thandi Shongwe.Speaking on behalf of Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe, Mhaule said they fondly remember the victims.“Our children and the people of South Africa must know how we travelled all the way from apartheid to democracy.“This is a good initiative of remembering these fallen heroes of our struggle,” she said.
