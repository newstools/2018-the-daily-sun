Conference Centre as the venue for the hearings, which cost R8.4 million,” he
said. Other major expenses include the following: Community radio stations and newspapers for the announcement
for families to register for the arbitration - R2 048 913Mirror Effect Trading for video production and streaming
services - R1 498 781Werkmans Attorneys - R1 188 913Vila Mora Express for transport services - R1 121 760Wits Language School for sign language and interpretation
services - R639 679Uwhakaziso Trading & Projects for recording services -
R423 250“It remains to be seen if enough has been budgeted to cover
the financial award that former deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke will be
announcing tomorrow for the relatives of those who died,” Bloom said.Bloom also noted that financial compensation is necessary
but not sufficient for the Esidimeni tragedy, which also requires the criminal
prosecution of all those responsible for the deaths.
