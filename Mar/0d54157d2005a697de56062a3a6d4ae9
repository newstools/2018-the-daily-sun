The increased movement of travellers further requires that Ports of Entry are fully capacitated.This therefore makes it imperative for ports to be well-prepared at all times to execute and facilitate traveller movement, and, importantly, also to mitigate illegal movements and transgressions," Gigaba said.He said the upsurge in traveller movements during peak periods puts a strain on limited resources at the ports of entry.Gigaba added that this means that additional human resources must be deployed as requested to ensure reasonable turnaround times and avoid congestions at ports.Â "All stakeholders in the border environment are mobilizing resources to address the shortage by either deployment of additional staff or provide overtime," he said.According to the Gigaba, the deployment of the SANDF along the borderline assists in safeguarding the country against illegal and irregular migratory movements.
