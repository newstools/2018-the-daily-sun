Mastandi Khunjulwa Mzondo from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, claims her tenant, Arab Ndebele, is taking advantage of her because she is a blind woman who recently lost her husband. Khunjulwa told Daily Sun Arab came to her house looking for a place to stay.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst9-rk6_KPLF7CxBeytCUL8iSc2fEapkbaL2zx_hHdC0fMDSUMUFvYeUR5VrW861IhJ-u1UjH_b6Wny5cOVMcFB75s9XLzyyWd2-s5rjyQm-6M7tmBRrcWh4OL-kyeQHqgxqhvvlrTgUAyCR1NNiHgIuWyD3MuqC16Rbj2L8WcCNEQ31TnrOzRhe9b0OyG6uK9A7fHpq-F2Z_q7BppWNeDwZLZYR-DHXbiGlX1HXWlkANjJdw06GxaQ5cXQR05lMNVuMymEiZOkYUktRcQgTf4C1EFz8k0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKLFtvFgmcPqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He harrassed my sick husband when he asked him to pay,” claimed Khunjulwa.She said after her husband’s death, Arab told her the room belonged to him. “When I asked him to explain how, he became arrogant and produced some fake maps claiming they show the demarcation between my house and the room in my yard,” she said.Arab claimed he bought the room a long time ago from Khunjulwa’s husband. “I have been running a car wash business in front of the room. I own it.“No one can tell me to pay rent in my own house. “It is not my problem if Khunjulwa’s husband kept this a secrete from her,” said Arab.He denied that he was taking advantage of her.“I respect her but this is my place. She must keep her house and I will keep my room.”Arab said he will contact Khunjulwa’s family to show them his proof of purchase and ownership.
