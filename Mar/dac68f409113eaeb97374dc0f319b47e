innovation allows patients with chronic illnesses to receive repeat medication
within three minutes.Dr Gwen Ramokgopa, Gauteng MEC for Health, said the Pharmacy
Dispensing Unit™ (PDU™) will reduce congestion in public healthcare facilities.
This works like an ATM for medication, with Skype-like
audio-visual interaction between patient and pharmacists and robotic technology
to dispense medication.The ATM dispenses chronic medication for patients living
with HIV/AIDS, Diabetes and TB.Ramokgopha  said the patients
come with a script from the clinic or hospital and they are loaded onto an electronic
patient system and given a pin code."They will then have to take the pin code together with
their bar coded IDs to the ATMs where they will scan the ID and enter their pin
code and get further instructions from the machine."Once the medicine is dispensed the patients will also
get a receipt," said Ramokgopha.
