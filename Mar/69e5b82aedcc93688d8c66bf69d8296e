The thorny issue of land expropriation without
compensation is here and it looks like it's going to dominate debates for quite
some time. Soon after the ANC supported the EFF's motion on land
expropriation without compensation, South Africa's opinion on the matter was
split into two.Some are for the idea while other are against it. And of
course, each grouping has its own 'reasonable' reasons.  The EFF's motion
calls for the constitution to be amended in favour of land expropriation
without compensation and for the state to be the sole custodian of the land.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvtqBPx07LwKlfhtI2vhWo-fcr1qXu8jlnKQoX6tDAAYreimne0HmKl-YGslSuc0ty6ND0yim105q1azX7e5C0jrjv_880JJzjTmEFZMYUlric37GkFwFYj8e4SA3JgKy1fWYKOM1EX2GAR9EwkcYqyUIsuxMUm4um4iXL5gc44hAEWs8xgTpo2XaPOQpPtgKSBHiuLJ6c7mW1akJZhvxGZNgeWzoZY4P7jw5RC_aFogm6ZskHK0xwxFYUj9FJFqCv1ddPnHIZXFLpwaVLEd1S7zy4QXRU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIez6rLv-Q18EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

99-year-old leases by the state.It has always been passed as fact that most of South
Africa's land is the hands of private individuals who happens to be white.So It was expected that this particular group will not
support the idea.Although the ANC and its president Cyril Ramaphosa in
particular, promised that the process would be done in an orderly manner and
would not disturb food security, the DA, Freedom Front Plus and ACDP, refused
to support the motion, calling it a recipe for disaster.Then outside the house, Afriforum also expressed its
dissatisfaction and even went as far as saying they would lobby the
international community to help halt the country from moving in this direction.While this was somehow expected, an unlikely opposition
to the bill also emerged - His Majesty, the Zulu King of Kwazulu Natal,
Goodwill Zwelithini. He does not want the government to touch the 2.8 million
hectares of land under the Ingonyama Trust. He said government must be forced to stop threatening to
take the land of the Zulu nation, “not unless it wants to see something
else".The King is the sole Trustee of the land under the
Ingonyama Trust.  The Trust was established in 1994 by the erstwhile
Kwazulu Government. The mandate of the Trust was to hold land for “the benefit,
material welfare and social well-being of the members of the tribes and
communities” living on the land.But it has been since found by a high level panel led by
former president Kgalema Motlante that there was “little evidence
that the trust’s very substantial reserves had been used for the benefit
of communities or their material well-being”.But still the king does not want the state to own this land and he
even asked all the Zulus to donate R5 each so that he can prepare for a legal
battle to stop the state from touching the land. He went further by saying
that he is the only one who steers the Zulu warship, so if the trust’s land was
threatened, “even Zulus from Germany or the US will come back and fight for
their land.” His Amakhosi in the province have also threatened that there will
be hell to pay should control of tribal land be taken away from them.
Kwazulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu has also said the ANC in Kwazulu-Natal
will never support any recommendations aimed at undermining the role of
"our" traditional leaders on land issues‚ including the Ingonyama
Trust. He made it clear they will not support any attempts to scrap the Ingonyama
Trust.So the government's land reform should not only go for soft
targets. It must do to the Ingonyama Trust what is going to do to all the
private land owners in South Africa. In fact, the Ingonyama Trust must be used
as an example of how the state is going to push ahead with land reform. There
must never be two sets of rules on land ownership. It's either you expropriate
from all of us or you don't. My family also owns three hectares of land, an
inheritance which has been passed from generation to generation. Although no
value was never attached to it, I will not allow the government to touch it if
they fail to touch the land under the Ingonyama Trust. And this should apply to
all South Africans. We must never reach an era where we allow special rules to
some people just because of their social standing. We expect equal treatment
under any law.
