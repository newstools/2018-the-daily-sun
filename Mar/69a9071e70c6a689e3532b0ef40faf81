WE are performers, we are artists – and the show must go on!Those who doubt the ambition of Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela had better take careful note of the declaration above.Despite the heavy 3-1 defeat to Orlando Pirates, Komphela has refused to rule Amakhosi out of the league championship race. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu1syO5vCUdh7C21Z5bajbsWbwcDgfuW-c3by-WNLcx75Ppf3und5c_eekNRG_9AcEjiBFnGNETIIkiFGf0QE8zuZ9xyUKeEYMVyneIkeWb7ipw63aqYQBhKbdRHi09A6WNhHGKjVB_h-AAGsS2CgMj4OYCeqNECNbP-o7HJLo2AC3uIQ7aDLjNhW5CbUvXoPSMJSZgFSb08z795sGhl6GjDeSl5Mdk-NmOC904XmHMY1k8gIFpuhRld1Ot_MceFVFXhzQoeJyETa5uJ6jBPe_dwQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKIWu8BqP4vcEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It is there. The three points – should we write ourselves off? I don’t think we feel like that. We have an obligation to keep on performing.“We just have to keep pushing. A win could have taken us to heaven. But it didn’t happen. We have a responsibility to keep performing, we are artists.”Amakhosi will have to bounce back and show their artistry when they face National First Division (NFD) side Stellenbosch FC in the Nedbank Last 16 round in Durban on Saturday.It’s a favourable draw for Amakhosi, who had to knock out fellow PSL side Golden Arrows in the Last 32 round.Komphela’s charges shouldn’t really raise a sweat against a team struggling to secure a play-off spot in the NFD.Chiefs haven’t come close to winning the Nedbank Cup since their triumph in 2012 and this season the cup could well be their saving grace.Said Komphela: “People are out there to see the show, so we cannot stop the show, whatever the reason.”
