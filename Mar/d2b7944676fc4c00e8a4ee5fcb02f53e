Mashaba said when the team first arrived at the property two weeks ago, they found electricity to the complex was illegally connected. “The technicians cut off power supply to the business complex but when they returned on Monday, they found it had been reconnected,” Mashaba said.He said officials were tipped off about who had connected the power and the person believed to be responsible was arrested. He was taken to Cleveland Police Station and was due to appear in the Jeppestown Magistrates Court soon. “I have instructed the Metro police to continue monitoring properties which are connecting to service illegally. If they are reconnected, the owers will be arrested immediately and possibly prosecuted.”Mashaba said Operation Buya Mthetho was aimed at enforcing by-laws and bringing the rule of law to Joburg. “We will not leave any stone unturned when dealing with criminals within our area of jurisdiction,” said Mashaba.He encouraged residents to report theft, fraud and corruption to the 24-hour hotline on 0800 002 587.
