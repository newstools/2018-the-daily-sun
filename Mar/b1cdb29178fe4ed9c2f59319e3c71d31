Let's all as a nation become part of Madiba's legacy," added Robinson. Meanwhile, Princess Manaway said Mandela's dreams would be realised through the initiatives.Money raised will go toward the Nelson Mandela Literacy Project. The project's libraries each work with thousands of children. The bracelets can be bought in stacks of 10 at R495 per pack.News24Sourcehttps://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/nelson-mandela-granddaughters-launch-crowdfunding-effort-for-jobs-and-literacy-20180330
