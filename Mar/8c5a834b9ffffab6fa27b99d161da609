In 2016 he was warned by the department of co-operative governance and traditional affairs, then president Jacob Zuma and Premier Willies Mchunu that he was violating the law.The party said parliament had been turned into a wrestling ring by MPs.“We never elected these MPs with such a mandate. They have proven to society that they are not statesmen, rather their actions are those of hooligans,” said the party.
