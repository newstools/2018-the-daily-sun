Close to 100 kids were rushed to the Noordgesig Clinic for treatment. Joburg Emergency Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said paramedics were originally told the kids were suffering from food poisoning. “But when we got there we found ceiling dust was bothering the pupils. “Our officials attended to the scene and were greeted by scores of itchy pupils who were scratching themselves continuously.”
