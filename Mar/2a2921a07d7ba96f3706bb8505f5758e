Now we are going to be working to attract more and more investment. The good thing you saw yesterday is our economy has shown signs of growing. That is very positive. Confidence is coming back to our country."The walk started at Lookout Hill and ended at the Rocklands Civic Centre, where the United Democratic Front was launched in 1983.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/we-want-to-get-rid-of-govt-officials-who-steal-and-lie-to-us-ramaphosa-20180307
