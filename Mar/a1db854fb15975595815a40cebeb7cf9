It wasn’t easy and having a support system was vital. My family has always been there for me and I’m truly grateful for that,” she said.She said her life was transformed when she joined the Itekeng Care Centre in her kasi. “It’s important to find a space where you can be with other people who are in the same situation as you. “We empower and encourage each other and I love it.
