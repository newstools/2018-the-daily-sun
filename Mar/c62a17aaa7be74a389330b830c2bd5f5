In the meantime, im gonna live it for you” in one of his tweets as he departed for the States.He also expressed how proud he was of what he has been able to achieve in his career and what it has afforded him and those close to him.“Makes me so happy to be able to take my team with me overseas. 2 of them going to the States for the 1st time. Makes me proud of them, and of myself.... of course, they won't be able to reach me in 1st class tho” one of his other tweets read.The Caiphus Song hit-maker jetted off to the United States last night to perform at the SXSW Festival in Texas this weekend.The Supa Mega will be sharing the stage with the likes of Talib Kweli and Wyclef Jean to name but a few.This will not be the first time he performs at this Festival though and neither will he be Mzansi’s sole representative as he will be joined by compatriot and fellow rapper Kwesta.
