He told Daily Sun the group came with two other men who were tied up and interrogated about Patrick’s whereabouts. “When his wife called to tell us about men travelling in a bakkie who took my brother, we immediately rushed to the police for help, but nothing was done.“We hoped they would try to look for him but they gave us the cold shoulder,” claimed Tshepo.He said on Saturday morning, they began to search for Patrick and heard he might be at a house in the neighbourhood. When they got to the house, they found his body there with some men who later disappeared.“We were shocked to find my brother’s body hanging half-naked. He had been beaten to death. “The house and his body was full of blood and electricity cables were next to him. It was the most painful thing ever for us,” he said.“What hurt us most is the bakkie he allegedly stole was found but he was killed like a dog for something he didn’t do. We will never forget the pain they caused us.”Tshepo said he hopes those who killed Patrick will be arrested soon.Captain Shirley Nsimba confirmed a murder case was registered on Saturday but said no arrests have been made.
