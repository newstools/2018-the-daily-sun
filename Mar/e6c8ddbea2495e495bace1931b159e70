He quoted Marcus Garvey: “A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots”. He said 2018’s theme for Human Rights Month was “The year of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela: promoting and deepening a human rights culture across society.” He said Tata fought tirelessly to ensure South Africans were freed from the bondage of apartheid but there was still a need to ensure people were economically free. He said the Human Rights Commission’s 2016 report showed there were still income inequalities based on race and gender. That was why the department of sports, arts and culture launched the Debut Fund Programme last year, to support young artists from historically disadvantaged backgrounds. The programme funds young artist who are writing books, releasing CDs or painting works for the first time. The main event will be held at Sharpeville on 21 March.
