The SABC had to fork out R22m to defend former chief
operations officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng during his tumultuous tenure at the
broadcaster, a parliamentary reply revealed on Wednesday.Motsoeneng was a respondent in no less than 15 different
cases since the 2013/14 financial year, former communications minister
Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane revealed in a reply to DA MP Thomas Hadebe.His highest legal bill, R5.3m, accrued from his fight
against the DA over the Public Protector's report into governance failures at
the broadcaster, When Governance and Ethics Fail.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuGcpOH2IZ5gaHvt4GkAsQhzTf1eup54CbH5_KPHm4lcu6VhaR2WWcieXBv8JFLFrpWNVNCAeRqMOKdy_n8zX8X_kq-kWUrT8WRF0ZjBqTD7b0fn35zJsRnQV-8WKcfLsULZy7-N3vC37p6ZfHDocZn0wJakwJJjQzG1MiB-CcGTYU7vF-dIynzBfdMoAOm4BOU4R820dStlR4RZ76ABpdEaCN1AtZN8_nlY_xFGZOJ5vJvZ7TiC50UHGdvNygkR5PHjlow7vs_CGumMUZ6cY0Y4ILXPJc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzH87VhJUuTM9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

"various SABC board matters", R1.6m against the Helen Suzman
Foundation and R1.1m in a case against veteran journalist Vuyo Mvoko.The total figure might increase as matters progress,
Kubayi-Ngubane added.The news comes at a bad time for Motsoeneng, after the
Special Investigating Unit (SIU) told Parliament last month it had issued a
summons against him for more than R21m he owes the broadcaster.DA MP Phumzile van Damme on Thursday said Motsoeneng must
pay back every cent owed to the taxpayer.Motsoeneng was eventually removed from his position at the
SABC in June last year after he was found guilty of bringing the public
broadcaster into disrepute in an internal disciplinary hearing.SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said the broadcaster would
consult its legal department before commenting, and to also confirm that the
information sent to the ministry was accurate.He would provide more detailed comment at a later stage.Attempts by News24 to reach Motsoeneng for comment on
Thursday were unsuccessful.The news comes in a week during which former president Jacob
Zuma was also called on to pay back the money spent on legal fees in his fight
against the corruption charges still outstanding against him.President Cyril Ramaphosa told Parliament on Wednesday that
Zuma had spent R15.3m of state money on legal fees since 2006, R7.5m of which
was spent before the charges were dropped in 2009.DA leader Mmusi Maimane also called on Zuma to pay back the
money, and said his party would start legal processes to look at recouping the
sum.Ramaphosa assured the House that Zuma had agreed to repay
the state if the court rules that he acted in his personal capacity when it
eventually deliberates on the matter.This was part of a signed agreement between Zuma and the Presidency
under then-president Thabo Mbeki in 2006.Â Meanwhile, the Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed
an application that sought to prevent National Director of Public Prosecutions
Shaun Abrahams from announcing his decision on whether the charges against Zuma
should be reinstated or not.The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said the
announcement could come any time after Thursday.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/hlaudi-motsoenengs-legal-fees-cost-the-sabc-r22m-20180315
