The councillor instructed them to put their request in writing but not to mention the amount they had requested. Nombiba then motivated for R30 000 which was paid into the NGO’s Standard Bank account on 4 November 2014.Two days later, the request was approved and Nombiba convinced them that R20 000 from the R30 000 was his. Handing down judgment, Magistrate Johannes Claasen said: “During the cross examination, Nombiba was evasive when he was asked to explain his side of the story. The testimony of the State’s witnesses was reliable and consistent.”Classen postponed the case to 26 April for sentencing.
