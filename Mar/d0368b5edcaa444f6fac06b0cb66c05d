He said the suspect had dagga hidden under his bed.“Our members attended a complaint at a local primary school. It was alleged pupils were smoking dagga on the school premises. “On arrival, the police could not find any drugs but did a follow-up investigation that led to the suspect’s house. The house was searched and dagga was found hidden under the bed,” he said. Kock said an undisclosed amount of cash was found under the mattress. He said the dagga had an estimated street value of R900. Kock said the man was arrested and charged. He will appear in the Richmond Magistrates Court soon.
