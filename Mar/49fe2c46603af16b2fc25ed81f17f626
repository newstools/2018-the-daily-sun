THE City of Joburg has called on residents to visit the graves of their loved ones to check whether they have been damaged by the heavy rain last week. The city’s MMC for community development, Nonhlanhla Sifumba issued a statement which read: “Among the affected areas is the new Olifantsvlei Cemetery, where some graves and headstones have collapsed and memorials placed on graves have been washed away.” She said the cemetery was big enough for 800 000 burials and had conducted just under 9 000 burials to date, with an average of 120 per week. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst0-WSo4UuhX0gAPjd98GCx2Rrq5ZqDffWqoqgknRvvRuQOil425GD4E5OB7FLq8zaNe_r67rCMImYvOMyRdyU9DJC2B-xzIafZIzfh4_zjGMbRSM_53nBBOotK4GN3Ydl8Etcu2bFoOICLQb_N1kRvogtihxWZiDwT8T_flTn5CjNFUyPlXeRtgBbp7QjtMqDL-pBFCEHGSKuAT9LUD_OXLoiA-wqfcEGqsT_yXyJyZPqYL3HPSBXF1O91p0GxnawlxdhdFb1FOzqbbxfJ0P7NAfpyC4k\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGQvWAfuqUCwEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
