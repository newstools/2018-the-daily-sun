MAMELODI Sundowns assistant coach Manqoba Mngqithi will be back in the hot seat tomorrow in the absence of Pitso Mosimane, who is attending a Caf coaching course in Morocco.Mngqithi recently held the fort when Mosimane served a suspension, guiding the Brazilians in two matches.Mosimane has often shown faith in his lieutenant, refraining from relaying messages from the stands to Mngqithi in the two matches against Cape All Stars and Free State Stars respectively.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstLKIXxTxLVbIf68bNzzhf0R-8iZ7TEtfr3-xpS6FcSY6fU_egLp-kddoxtghLbXw2liT1SC6b7a2f9HwdhBhapz5Ie_oBXHD56vWYwxConS8En9ASqPXnTQJsO9YsXz9SLwV80KAGhQSiYlUqhYxMVoio5Dv7yrnL3rmcJ7Gj5-cm7wUq3-WARXFgdXvGy6T8CgUlLmGLpbTri4swnXRvGNvzTFju7mZYaYGkYCswkc-A3z7uZCgWWxtsg4Z5GIRD8DyPsoL3qRRI5TAxl\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCtijMOLOBbaEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But the Tshwane giants first have a Nedbank Cup matter to attend to before they can start plotting Rayon’s downfall.“It teaches you to involve the people you work with in your plans, your thinking. If they know your game plan, then there’s no need for a phone call,” Mosimane said. “It’s how you as head coach work with your assistant. Sometimes head coaches do their own thing and their assistants only see the lineup on the day of the match. “When you have a good assistant who has been at the highest level, you are able to talk about instructions.”
