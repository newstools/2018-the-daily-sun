I am convincing them of something that is different to who I really am and that was my goal as an actor. "Wherever I go, people look at me with distaste. My dad was even concerned and sat me down to talk about my character. He told me that he didn't raise me to hit a woman,” he told the publication.The actor also revealed that having to play Tebogo is so physically draining that after his first ‘abusive’ scene, he got home, showered and passed out."It was very heavy. I have never been an abuser so it was very emotionally draining. I just went home. Showered and passed out. It was all the energy I had,” he said.
