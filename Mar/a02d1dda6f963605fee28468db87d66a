Jan (63) found out from nyaope smokers who hang around the cemetery that it was hit by a bakkie delivering another tombstone. They tried to stop the man driving the bakkie, but he sped off. Jan said: “The money we saved for the unveiling now has to be used to fix the tombstone.” He said they were angered by the lack of respect for the dead. “Who hits a tombstone and runs away? “He should have left his contact details on the tombstone or reported it to the security guards.” “Whoever did this has created a lot of work for us. “We will have to hold a ceremony to calm my mum.” Jan appealed to the person who hit the tombstone to come forward.“What happened is unfortunate, but we can solve it like adults.”
