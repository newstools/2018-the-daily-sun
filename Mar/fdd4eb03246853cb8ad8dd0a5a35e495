Van Zyl moved into the spot vacated by Papier and Stassen, who is also on debut, will take over from Jenkins as back-up lock. Van Wyk replaces the suspended Conraad van Vuuren. Coach Mitchell has a strong message for the team if they want to return victorious from Christchurch. “To beat the Crusaders, you need to outwork them. That will not be easy, as they have a tremendous work ethic as a team. We are not on this journey to become a better team because it is easy, so we must be prepared to play for all 80 minutes and play every big moment to the best of our ability.” In this game, Adriaan Strauss will extend his national Super Rugby record to 148 when he takes to the field. This will equal Victor Matfield’s record as the most capped South African Super Rugby player.
