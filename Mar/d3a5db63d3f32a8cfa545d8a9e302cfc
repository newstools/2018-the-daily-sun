Semenya’s time was 2:35.43 at the Athletix Grand Prix Series in Pretoria.She shattered the previous record of 2:37.20 set by Ilze Wicksell in 1983.Not one for many words, Semenya prefers to do her talking on the track.She said she was elated to achieve another goal in her life, adding that it might not have been easy, but definitely worth every second.Semenya’s manager, Samuel Sepeng, said it was through hard work and determination that she was able to reach the heights she has today.“Caster is a hard worker of note and keeps focused. We are happy for her. Her diploma tells us that she has long- term goals in her sports career. “She’s already focusing on the development of youth in sport, especially athletics and has to plan ahead as she won’t be on the track forever.”
