We want them to tell us about the first school ever built in our area,” said Mzukwa.The forum condemned land grabs taking place in the area.“We are not proud of the violent protests that have been happening. We believe things have to be done differently,” said Domingo.Gogo Elileen Ofisi (75) said while the township was celebrating 60 years of existence, it was not nice to see the area in the news for the wrong reasons. “Gugulethu is one of the oldest townships in the country. We are happy to share stories about our township. We used to be happy here when there was no crime.”
