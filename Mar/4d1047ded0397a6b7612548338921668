CHAOS erupted yet again yesterday over a farmer in the Eshowe area.Residents of the area of northern KZN went on the rampage. They want a farmer accused of getting his security guards to kill a man to be arrested or banned from the area. The furious protesters set sugar farms alight and blocked access roads with burning tyres after Siphamandla Xulu (31) was gunned down by private security guards. He was caught illegally fishing on the farmer’s land on Tuesday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstu8R_EnefzSDirBWn8xMDkPY9mHAE4qCl3zJ8AVOmMFkZWTi4awKPEI40ZPhJIDqnnwhwPppqNJNaeSxjEjv1O6nTcwNaUFjiUqfzZiRdOMndyBxCQVf4KsF0ned8FcD9NVbm78kZItUrspiWKO1DZyF9UZ5pIHLZqE8l-uIyw6PRlrrj3gUJpstUsDB83BeLJRezUz_28x7a0S_d6iZHJSybM2PcN0T5KX9Nz5Juj5zWpuNwwBhAMJE71Igxf6Qk8yUxpeC8Q99E434Or7xL_QtTCFus\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA12yXaI82UgEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Gumede claimed the same farmer beat a man and drove over him less than five years ago. Resident Zamile Mhlongo (40) said: “We don’t want this farmer here. He hates us.” Mkhuseli Buthelezi, spokesman for Umlalazi Municipality, said efforts to locate the farmer had failed. He urged residents to calm down and allow the cops to deal with the matter. Buthelezi said a number of sugar farms that belonged to farmers not involved in the incident were also set alight. Provincial police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of public violence was opened and a 21-year-old was arrested and charged with murder.
