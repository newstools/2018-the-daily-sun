Tembisa born DJ and producer, DJ Shimza, is a proud dad and he reckons becoming a father has turned him into a better person.Speaking to Metro FM’S Pearl and Amon, Shimza said although it came as a shock to him initially, being a parent has become a blessing and has made him wiser.“It channelled me in a way that said you can’t be going around spending money on champagne at clubs, you’ve got a five year old that needs to go to school, even making sure that i leave renting and buy a house so that even if i go tomorrow she’s got something” he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvdTteWk8WqvJGcnpYydJrv3Cm_FESL04BRhc7HKQGqHk81yRUdewT_6XGvXXC1p5G96TNzqcbOTt8xz6_y60khMRylOeT4SgGM1DUQpaA0kZorwoIg_uG_Si34iX73en2g9ZkWEKSqkT5lacpemeQ0G2TSTmaQoCaDQCUhM73_MBwFnDDSPD7971mx4A9U8oeLBRqRUthS8QeFhLFickhkzJgM7UjJr4InXg-T7JG8PTFPZ_NGFybdQ8wv4xKedctwM4xHgdHj0mWogVrahVbqYGCC9-qbSLBtSg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCWeouxefzEqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
