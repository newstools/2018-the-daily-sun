SHE was only 16 when she was raped by a balding, fat man,
three times her age – while her mum smoked a cigarette and kept guard outside
the door.This is Australian Peta Butler’s horror story that only publically
emerged last month, although the rape happened over 10 years ago.According to news.com.au, Peta’s mum, Therese Butler, had
taken her daughter by bus on a “girl’s weekend” to Toowoomba, a town in the
eastern part of Australia. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvfV0pvwf6vRO9cLCvisjoca-YUTqbAih8e7zJKo1CwVatJFLdXBjPtFEDAvagQPbhPLfD5z0rUEyUxIpQa-dAsKX2KxZthVYT3X-o79YFaD3GobuwiIVGiy1q1rUX7pGJ11OqAEPdailHkuHEIaWHwwv74w-EmHk0-Dh-ZE0T4jyK77OraaqZf-tXwxb3q8d7W7nwKdWqQEruoUOvSpyC_TQu6bUqAYPBzWn0t1A76CgWYEFBC7pHS5fQa1rVctGMRZ2OxM7JubO58VkWdbnH-DR56dHlE_HrzJg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDJmDNKwM6fEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

booze and encouraged her daughter to drink, saying it would keep her warm. She
then took her to a cheap hotel.Speaking out to the media for the first time last month,
Peta remembered her shocking ordeal with an obese older man known only as “Thommo”. “Not long after
that, he entered the room. He didn’t say anything. He just literally walked up
to me and took off his clothes and took off my pants. I was frozen. I couldn’t
do anything. I just couldn’t move.“He raped me for a couple of minutes. It only lasted ...
I had my head turned to the side.“I couldn’t, like, my voice box, I couldn’t speak ... I
couldn’t scream out to my mum, I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t do anything.“He never said anything ... I felt his face stubble. He
had face stubble, feeling that. And I still remember the smell of him. I still
remember.“He held my hands down. I couldn’t move and he was very
big ... he was on top of me.” “I think to myself
‘how could a mum do what she did’?”“How could a mum sit outside knowing that their daughter
is being raped by her potential boyfriend?”Now in her late 20s, Peta said she only found the courage
to speak up when she had daughters of her own. She went to the cops in 2016, and with their help phoned
her mum to get a recording of her confession.In the confession, the evil mum tells her daughter: “I
wouldn’t have taken you down there unless you were 16. “It was still...
yeah ... it was still rape, but you were 16. I wouldn’t let him touch you
under, under sixteen, no way”.Therese Butler pleaded guilty to procuring a kid for
carnal knowledge and sentenced to four years in prison, suspended after 12
months.Cops are now hunting for Peta’s rapist, Thommo, who would
now be in his mid-fifties. They have released a computer-generated image of him
based on Peta’s description of him.“Anyone who believes they have been hurt by this man is
urged to visit their local police station and speak with investigators,” cops
said on Tuesday.
