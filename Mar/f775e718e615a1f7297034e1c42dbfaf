She filed the affidavit at Mendeville Police Station in Jamaica and is being assisted by the police in the Caribbean island in her case against the Mzansi-based scammers.Jessica said she was worried the scammers’ asctions could lead to her name being damaged and hurt her business. “When your name is at the core of your personal business and you’re in the public eye, it’s very hurtful for someone to make up lies to embezzle money from your business associates and friends,” she said.“The act has a negative effect on your reputation and relationship with the public.”According to the affidavit, filed last week, Jessica received a WhatsApp message from a person claiming to be Kwesta, asking for singer Nathi’s contact details. The person claimed to have got Jessica’s number from musician Vusi Nova.
