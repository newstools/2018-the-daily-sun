He was a good man. Thugs were waiting for him to arrive home so they could rob him of his gun,” said the neighbour.Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said: “A manhunt for three suspects has been launched. “At about 4pm, the constable was on his way home and was about to drop off his neighbours in JB Mafora in Mangaung. A BMW car approached them and three men came walking towards his car. One of the men, armed with a firearm, knocked on the constable’s window. The man demanded his firearm and when he refused, the suspect allegedly fired one shot that wounded Bongani in the chest. The suspect then searched the constable and took off with his 9mm service pistol. “The constable died on the way to hospital.” Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects can call Sergeant Morena Machalotsa at 073 729 1732.”
