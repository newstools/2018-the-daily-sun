is, the fact until today, Prasa has not submitted its 2016/17 annual report. It
is supposed to be submitted at the end of September every year.  We are just a few weeks away from the end of
the financial year of 2017/18,” she said.Magadzi said that the investigation will tackle irregular
expenditure as was seen in its procurement processes.  As well as the irregular and illegal
contracts entered into with service providers and issues raised in the Public
Protector’s 2015 report Derailed.In February former Prasa CEO Lucky Montana appeared before
the Eskom inquiry. His testimony opened up the question for an inquiry by the
transport committee.When asked if Montana’s testimony had led to the decision
for the Prasa inquiry, Magadzi said "absolutely not”.SOURCE: NEWS24
