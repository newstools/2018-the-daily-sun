We were also told they would be expanding the OR Tambo Memorial,” she said.“But they are doing all this at the expense of our shacks.” Duma Shongwe (30) had been living in Harry Gwala for 19 years.He said: “We did not want to move, so we moved to the nearby soccer field to be safe. The municipality wants to move us to an unsafe place where the soil has chemicals. The area will put our kids’ lives at risk.”Themba Gadebe, a spokesman for the City of Ekurhuleni, said the moving of squatters would take four days.“The land on which Harry Gwala is situated will be upgraded to a township,” he said. “An engineering and development contractor has been appointed to render infrastructure development to support the successful implementation of the project.”Gadebe said the site to which the 359 squatter families were being moved had been prepared. Water and sanitation would be provided, he said. “About 964 residential units will be built.”
