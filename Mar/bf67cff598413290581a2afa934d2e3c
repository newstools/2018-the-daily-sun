When he is at school, Ponny is allowed to graze in the schoolyard and Otsile gives him water during his breaks. “Pupils who use the school bus often arrive late for classes and end up performing badly,” Otsile told Daily Sun.He said their area is rural and doesn’t have proper infrastructure. “Unemployment is high and most parents rely on social grants.” Otsile told the People’s Paper he replaces the pony’s shoes every month to protect his hooves because the surface is very poor. “Since I have been riding my pony, my grades have improved,” he said. “I’ve decided to focus on my work so that I pass well at the end of the year.” “I want to study medicine at the University of Free State to change the lives of my parents and myself.”He encouraged young people to stay away from drugs and substance abuse and focus on their studies.“Remember that education is the way to a better life and no one can take it away from you. “As young people, we should focus on our studies,” he said.
