FOR a team operating with a modest budget, Free State Stars have already exceeded expectations this season.Sitting rather comfortably in the top eight of the Absa Premiership, Ea Lla Koto are now through to the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals thanks to their hard-fought 2-1 victory over Chippa United at Goble Park over the weekend.And based on their ever-improving performances, there is good reason to believe the fairy-tale cup run will continue for Stars, as they have none of the usual relegation worries this season.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssGIMNqbkU81-K0zW2KoRcfmCblvfs5ad5vXeLTpuLSvJB8J6aauCOnut8kLikpZu_lVrHU4nd5bLpCLk3hQVQuNZQyGZ28-5Ig3G8I4HVKAFngSznDeM8LbJgXd8hxyCYoAM0C2wpWZFc8J02rlwMtrVlTI9n7Q-F7TRXpXIKdOMOu6EI4foOvWBsoMUdcRB86ixTHGwE4GUf5HxpjLO3if_WWFt5iq78dvnOqUy-TBLQklFp6M61TVIot9963VK94E9U3Ahm9f__fMTyl\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFNagIGu40RWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Next week we are going to them (Chippa) for a league match, and we have to improve. “We have two players suspended and will make changes. But the win is good for morale. “The league is also important because I want to be in the top eight. Five more wins and we will be assured of that mathematically. Any win after that will determine where we finish.” Eymael says he doesn’t choose between competitions and will be giving priority to both cup and league.Cobbling together a team on a tiny budget, Stars hardly prioritise knockout competitions. But they showed intent against Chippa, going through thanks to goals by Paulus Masehe and Bangali Keita. Linda Mntambo netted for the visitors. A second successive win against the troubled Chippa when they meet in the league at Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm) will see Stars hit the 40-point mark. Vladislav Heric has partly blamed logistical challenges for Chippa’s cup elimination. The Serb got his tenure off to a poor start but sounded more concerned about the state of the team than about the cup exit.Said Heric: “The logistical challenges completely changed my plan for the game. We have to work on fitness, aggressive defending and pressure after repossession. I can’t truly judge our performance because of these difficulties. “We knew Stars would be dangerous on breaks. But I couldn’t give more attention to this as we had a very short time to prepare. And that’s where we lost the game.” He said they would pay more attention to set-pieces in the next match.
