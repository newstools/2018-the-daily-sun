We could only rely on the legislation being fast tracked to enable other religious leaders to go in there and say it was very much out of the ordinary and needed to be disabled.”She said when they met the church leaders, they clearly told the commission they did not believe in education.“They said they were sent by God and that they were Jesus’ brothers, here to catch the devil and take him back to hell.“People were selling their valuable goods, cashing in their pensions, emptying their bank accounts, taking their cars and everything they owned and their children to go and live in the church.”She said they knew at that point that the money would eventually dry up and there would be problems.“We alerted everyone who needed to know, including the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs. We said there must be a regulatory framework to stop places like Ngcobo developing.” She said they were waiting to hear from parliament about the next step. Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said they had never felt so useless and powerless. “We feel like this is the end of the road for us.” She claimed that Freedom of Religion South Africa, known as FOR SA, told them to leave the system as it was. “We told them if we did that, people were going to die.” Michael Swain, director of FOR SA, said that if CRL had been given permission by parliament to regulate the religious community, the deaths could have been prevented.Mama Noluzo Mancoba who spoke for the church on behalf of her brother Banele, said Mkhwanazi-Xaluva had met the brothers. “Yes, they told her they were from heaven,” she said.Mama Noluzo said they don’t force anyone to leave school or give up work and donate all their wealth.“It’s their choice,” she said.Parliamentary spokesman Moloto Mothapo could not be reached but on Monday he said the matter would be addressed.
