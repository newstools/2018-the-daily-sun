Maybe let's see how women really feel during that process...maybe show the real side of pregnancy. I get that, but I am not alright in the head, so they can't be exposing that kind of stuff on screen.""We know it will all happen in due time. We aren’t in a rush but we can’t wait to start a family." she told Anele.Minnie has also slammed rumours that she and her hubby, Quinton Jones, have been experiencing trouble in paradise."First I’m getting divorced then I’m fighting in public with my husband. Mrs Jones ain’t going anywhere, no matter what lies you try spread." She said previously on Twitter and still stands by her words. Minnie and Quinton tied-the-knot in fairy-tale traditional and white weddings last year, and documented the special occasion through a three-part documentary.
