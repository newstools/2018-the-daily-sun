understood that the charges related to an incident on August 13, 2012 in which
striking miners were stopped by police while making their way from the mines to
the koppie.The officials will reportedly appear for the deaths of
Thembelakhe Mati, Semi Jokanisi and Phumzile Sokhanyile.On August 16, 2012, police shot dead 34 miners and wounded
scores more while trying to put an end to their strike for a better wage. Most
of the miners were shot in the back.By the end of the strike, 44 people had died.Miners demanded that their pay be increased to R12 500 per
month, nearly tripling what they earned at the time.Seventy-two police officers involved in the killing of the
miners were investigated by the IPID.Last month, following President Cyril Ramaphosa's promise of
atonement for the Marikana massacre, families of the striking miners who were
killed said that reparations should include a formal apology from the police
minister and the institution of criminal charges against the police officers
involved.During Ramaphosa's response to the debate over his first
State of the Nation Address (SONA) he said he was determined to play whatever
role he could in the process of healing and atonement in relation to the
Marikana massacre."The Marikana tragedy stands out as the darkest moment
in the life of our young democracy," Ramaphosa told both Houses of
Parliament.The Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (SERI),
which represents 36 families of the killed miners, welcomed the president's
comments, but urged him to turn his promises into actions.SERI said in a statement, if the government was serious
about atoning for the Marikana massacre, the families of those killed had
indicated that a meaningful response would include financial compensation, a
formal apology from the police minister and that the police officers involved
in the killings be charged criminally and prosecuted.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/9-senior-police-officials-to-appear-for-marikana-massacre-20180315
