Munghana Lonene FM listeners can hear his inspirational talks every Sunday morning on Sisimuka u Vangama which is hosted by Mama Beka.Moses said people from as far afield as Mozambique listen to the show. “I was recently invited to conduct a three-day empowerment programme in Mozambique where I shared words of inspiration and the response was positive. I’ll continue to do what God has called me to do and give strength to those who are hopeless.” Moses has written two books, Your Breakdown Is Your Breakthrough and Live The Life of Victory.“My first book described how I struggled in life. I share most of my stories on radio,” he said.Moses won the best motivational speaker award at the Golden Stars Awards last year and was a finalist in the Bushbuckridge Heroes Awards.
