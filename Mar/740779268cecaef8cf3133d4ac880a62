N12 highway near Daveyton in Ekurhuleni wrote to the SAPS to thank the heroic actions of the Etwatwa
based cop.“He will always be mine, my husband and my children's hero.
My two boys still have their father, I still have a husband and his parents
still have their child, all because of Captain Maqabe.” These were the words of an overjoyed wife after her
husband’s life had been saved by Maqabe, who was off-duty at the time.The wife of the victim said:  “On Tuesday evening (last week), my husband was
hijacked on the N12 highway in the Daveyton area. He was brutally attacked and
stabbed in the chest with a knife, and in his arms with a screwdriver. He
fought off the attackers and managed to get out of their grip. He then ran
across the highway for help.The wife said her husband  stood bleeding without shoes or a shirt in the
middle of the road in oncoming traffic, for a long time while nobody stopped to
help! But one person stopped - an off-duty policeman who had
his family in the vehicle with him. "I received a phone call at approximately 20:15 from
Captain Maqabe's number. He gave his phone to my husband to phone me and let me
know he had been hurt but was okay, he was with a policeman, who was taking him
to the hospital. He allowed my husband to be in constant contact with me, as I
was driving from Witbank to be with him."Captain Maqabe took my husband to Life Healthcare
Parklands in Springs. Today, my husband is alive - not because the stab wound
was not severe, or his other injuries were not serious, but because Captain
Maqabe reacted swiftly and saved his life - literally," said the thankful
woman.Later that evening at about 21:00, the captain phoned the
woman and  asked for the details of the
vehicle that had been hijacked, so that he could have the details circulated to
trace the vehicle. "I thought I would not be surprised if this same act
of selflessness resulted in the vehicle being found that same night. The
vehicle was recovered in Delmas and one of the four suspects was arrested. I
was in awe of this captain, not being on duty, but still serving his country,
his fellow South Africans, with so much pride. He was not even supposed to
work, but he delivered a service and for that I will be eternally thankful."My husband is only alive because of his heroic act,
and I cannot thank him enough. He is a true policeman, who did the SAPS proud.
You can truly be proud of him."
