Ministries church‚ the South African Schools and the Constitution are demonic.This is the same church where a group of gunmen involved in
the Ngcobo massacre were hiding when they were gunned down by the police last week.The church is no
stranger to controversy, having been raided by police two years ago to remove
children who were reportedly being prevented from going to school.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssGyvwCNQYYETG_PbxdCB_ggRSG3ppCLsSEMWSh2t2yMGozMEMIARfsEar_lv4gCCCoOvDNee0MhTLrhr7KVJNg0UrAFup8xdI71i0M9IoIHqmjA8aOFf2pCrhtGpyuPfD0vKE1a572wA6Zg0pMgpCW_FlSMlQRZoDz2WPCNY44sv3hEKDSnzYtiHEMeP7xzefPaTnFDEeeQh_NWmmXfMyVPCZ7KTU5lG_7StnHHa1co5HSBhluvPsUN1SLEFJZ50x7Ru5DUrsLjvY2Qyw-844aEcKpR24\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNbTKFL9YuuzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

of South Africa and the school system."We say the constitution is wrong and people should not
listen to it."We say kids should not go to school....education is
wrong...because Satan is at school," they told Religious and Linguistic
Rights Commission last year. They also refused to be addressed as pastors but angels from
heaven who are here to look for Lucifer (Satan) who was
thrown out of heaven.Religious and Linguistic Rights Commission chairwoman Thoko
Mkhwanazi-Xaluva believes the killings in Nngobo could have been avoided had parliament
heeded the early warning signs.Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said at a media briefing on Thursday that they
included the interviews they had with the leaders of this church."We never asked
for the regulation of religion. We asked for a regulatory framework that could
monitor cults like Seven Angels who believe in some form of extremism"We were taken to court by Freedom of Religion for
saying, 'If nothing is done, people are going to die.' But now it has happened,"
said Mkhwanazi-Xaluva.She said they are now  going to approach the Constitutional Court for
a declaratory order on their recommendations that practitioners must be
regulated. "We should have access to individual practitioner's
information. The Portfolio Committee doubts the constitutionality of our
recommendations," said Mkhwanazi-Xaluva.
