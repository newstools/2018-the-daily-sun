Jesus!” but it seemed to make the attacks worse.Teachers at the school looked on helplessly, not knowing what to do.The attacks happen at about 10am every day.Teachers at Mashilo-Matsho Primary School in Lebotlwane, North West said they have been battling what they claim are evil spirits for the past three weeks.Parents said they have to go to school with their kids to help catch them when they fall. They said the kids start screaming, then hold their stomachs, fall down and roll on the ground.“Some run away and some roll on the floor like snakes as if something is inside their bodies,” said a parent.They said the kids said when they close their eyes they see a big snake that makes them run away. It was apparent the kids were traumatised.“I don’t want to come to school, please take me home,” screamed one child.Another pleaded with the pastor.“Please help us because this thing will kill us,” she said.The pupil, who is said to be the first to be affected, told Daily Sun no one knows what’s wrong with her.“I’m hoping these prayers will help,” she said.The principal of the school, Bobby Phiri, said her pupils were suffering.“When it started we didn’t take it seriously but now it has become very bad. We need help,” she said.“Parents have been coming to the school to help us pray and assist teachers. We have been calling pastors to pray for the children but it hasn’t helped. It breaks our hearts to see such young bodies acting in this manner.”Parents said when their children are at home they are unaffected. We are thinking they should stop going to school because this might kill them,” one parent said.Local councillor Eliphus Moselane said they are trying to get help. “We hope this evil spirit goes away,” he said.Pastor Mnisi, who was called in specifically to pray for the first pupil, said the girl held the key to solving the problem.“If we can help her everything will stop,” he said.He prayed for her, the school, the children, teachers and parents.He said the only way they can tell if the prayers worked is to wait for 10am today.By the time of going to print Bayanda Zenzile of the North West Education Department had not responded to Daily Sun’s enquiries.
