A number of recent “sex” surveys conducted by several South African publications and organizations such as Durex, Right to Know and the Human Sciences Research Council have revealed a disturbing decline in the use of condoms amongst South Africans.The numbers are particularly alarming among the youth of the country, mainly Generation Z who are between the ages of 18 and 24.In 2017, the Durex Global Sex Survey (GSS) found that up to 41% of South Africa’s youth are not active users of condoms when engaging in sexual activity.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>According to the survey, this was due to their belief that “being in a trusted relationship reduces the need to exercise caution and protection,” the study says.Finally, it also showed that a quarter of Generation Z admit to losing their virginity before the age of 16.The GSS also revealed that 19% of Mzansi’s youth who claim to be in a romantic relationship, are having sex outside of that relationship.The study surveyed people from all walks of life in 42 countries, including Mzansi.However, most of the work that has gone into sexual and reproductive health as well as the use of condoms whether by the youth or in general, focus largely on abstinence and prevention.Although these are vital aspects of the conversation, Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng says that a better approach would be to also talk about the pleasure that condoms can provide.“The issue with condom use is that people only talk about condom use as a prevention of disease. They never talk about the sexual pleasure of condoms. And that’s the problem. People are already not seeing how that can act as some sort of pleasure,” says Dr Mofokeng.Dr Mofokeng is a Medical Doctor by profession; she is also a founding member and Vice-Chairperson of the Sexual and Reproductive Justice Coalition of South Africa (SRJCZA), a board member and the African representative on the Durex Global Advisory for Sexual Health and Wellbeing, as well as host of the television edutainment show, Thrills with Dr T.She is a firm advocate for the pleasure that condoms can provide during sexual intercourse while also protecting you from STIs and serving as a contraceptive.Condoms can definitely increase your sexual pleasure when, for example, they are paired with a lubricant, which is something that a lot of people are still unaware of.“There is a lack of information, a lack of specific information around sexual pleasure in general and how condoms themselves can increase sexual pleasure,” says Dr Mofokeng.There seems to be a misconception that the use of condoms reduces the amount of sexual contact you receive which in turn is equated with a reduction in sexual pleasure when compared to unprotected sex.This misconception is further strengthened by the fact that condoms are only ever spoken of in the context of preventing disease and pregnancy and never in the context of pleasure.However, it is not just the use of condoms that is important here; you have to find the right type of condom for you and your partner’s preference.According to Dr Mofokeng the issue lies within the general public’s lack of health literacy.She believes that health literacy, not just in relation to sexual health, but health in general affects people’s ability to make informed decisions, to seek help early if need be, and to manage their sex lives.“When it comes to sexual health issues, it is more pronounced because the consequences are that much more serious and for some people, life changing,” she says.So before we can even tackle the issue of using condoms for pleasure, thereby increasing the number of people engaged in safe sex, we must first tackle the nation’s health literacy levels.In addition, we must also improve the Life Orientation modules in South African public schools.We must ensure that teachers become the recipients of comprehensive sexual education so that they are able to become sex-positive and affirming educators.“There needs to be proper assistance and continuous training of the teachers themselves, because they themselves are homophobic, they themselves are sexist; some of them are part of the problem of harassing learners in schools. So unless you’re dealing with those systemic issues, it is no good to just say ‘oh well just use condoms’,” says Dr Mofokeng.What Dr Mofokeng alludes to is a greater, more national problem that can prevent people from making more informed decisions about their sexual practices.In addition to the issue of the schooling system, we do exist in a country with an unhealthy balance of power when it comes to sexual relations, a country plagued by rape and these broader issues make negotiating the use of condoms very difficult.“A lot of South African women are not having sex when they want to have sex and so they cannot negotiate condom use, even those in marriages and relationships. So we need to deal with the other, broader issues as well,” says Dr Mofokeng.The imbalance of power in relationships and between men and women in general can have a negative impact on the understanding of what consent is as well as making informed choices like choosing to use condoms and finding ways to make the experience pleasurable for both parties.One way to improve the problem of health illiteracy in Mzansi is by having target campaigns that help people engage in conversations that they normally wouldn’t.For example, February was Sexual Reproductive Health month in Mzansi and during that month, we also join the international community in commemorating Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI)/Condom Week.Such campaigns are vital in raising awareness when it comes to issues like using condoms for sexual pleasure.Because these discussions are rarely ever had and so it is great to amplify the message throughout an entire month.But the work must continue beyond just one month.We must also leverage organizations such the departments of health, education and social development to change their approach to the matter.“The only time you will hear or see them [government] on anything, it is related to HIV and is disease-driven; nothing about sexual pleasure, nothing that is affirming about young people’s sexuality and that is why it doesn’t resonate with them, they don’t trust them because they don’t even engage with them online even if people have questions. They’re just disengaged,” says Dr Mofokeng.What’s even more fascinating is that Dr Mofokeng says that we also need to discuss sexual rights as human rights.“We need to be talking about sexual rights as well because those are also human rights, sexual pleasure is a human right. How do we start having those conversations openly with young people beyond abstinence?” she says.Finally, we must also encourage young people, even as early as high school to have healthy discussions about sex.One programme that offers a platform for discussions to learners who can engage with other learners in a non-judgmental forum, is the Durex CONNECT-ED Buddy programme.The initiative aims to educate high school learners (Grades 8-12) on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, sexual abuse and sexual health. The programme seeks to empower learners to make better decisions related to their sexual health, and empower educators to provide better support to learners in school and by empowering educators by aiding them with sexual education material such as the CONNECT-ED Buddy.
