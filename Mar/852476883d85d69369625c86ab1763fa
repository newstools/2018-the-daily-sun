Undeterred by being hauled off to the Equality Court by its
rival, the DA â€“ the EFF is unapologetic and is going ahead with its plans to
remove Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip, the party said on Friday. Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the EFF would table a
motion of no confidence against Trollip on April 6 to "punish" the DA
for voting in Parliament on Tuesday against the motion to change section 25 of
the Constitution to allow for expropriation of land without compensation."No amount of deliberate misrepresentation of the CIC
Julius Malema's statements as hate speech will deter us from punishing the DA
for their attitude on the land question," Ndlozi said in a statement. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstwJT8Sh0cX4P_endXLb8shQJht_vs5UjLT75BDhTOkugo-gxrPwppDr298Hs4r1ngqDmuYRHFqutN2dYH0-P5H0fQKpJVHotraV8zTzvw2JR4jOaRpaBJECeA1kFtvEAwPDNFEfq6WNoYLlS5_rDlp_e7U5L0gqVUfukgYiAbjw0jg7HGy2R6t4HADfKrSApjuPh7BJIF2JYQYxKuAWeCuZWjre7-sLkxLcUv247fCgvC154S_eovf-M5CZ7-0jFMCKWI03e0qyL2CewfxtAHc3FSfyF4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAsbTN9s_NauEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Malema to the Equality Court for what it deems to be hate speech and incitement
of violence.The DA quoted him as saying: "[We] are going to remove
a mayor of PE... [we] are going for your white man in PE. We are going to cut
the throat."In response, Ndlozi said Malema would not apologise as he
used "throat-cutting" as a figure of speech for
"unapologetically and unsympathetically removing Trollip to mirror their
(DA's) own unsympathetic attitude toward black land loss".'If they lose Trollip, they should also lose other mayors'"We use that metaphor to indicate that we are ending
support for the DA due to its own racism. Because we have chosen to do this
with Athol Trollip," he said. He said the DA's escalation of the fight to the Equality
Court would lead to the party's mayors in Johannesburg and Tshwane being
removed. The EFF had earlier said those mayors, who are governing with the
voting support of the EFF, were "safe for now". "The point is, if they lose Trollip, they should also
lose others, because other mayors are not white," Ndlozi said.He was referring to Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and
Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga. The EFF statement further stated that the party was irked by
the DA's disregard for colonialism and apartheid land dispossession, accusing
DA MPs of making comments from the parliamentary benches that were insensitive
to the loss of land by black people. "Each time the land question comes up, they deliberately
disregard the evident and indisputable history of dispossession. Their
argument, in essence, is that government must pay white people for land that
was taken through a systematic crime against humanity," he said.SOURCE: NEWS24
