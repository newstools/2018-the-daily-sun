According to the city, a contractor will start clearing the ground and laying pipes where the new units will be built early next month.Vuyokazi Majeke (53) is one of the residents being moved. She said the development will finally give her and her four children privacy and dignity in the form of a house.“My shack had just one room. “I have to ask my kids to go outside every time I wanted to have a bath. “When I get my own house, I won’t have to do that. “I will have electricity and water in my house that I’ve never had before.” Lucky Mkhonza (36) said his life and that of his children would take a positive turn.“Life in an informal settlement isn’t easy. “It’s dark, cold and dusty. “Electricity is one of the things I’m excited about. My children will be able to watch TV and learn from it like other kids ,” said Lucky.Ekurhuleni Municipality said over 961 families will be accommodated in RDPs and rental units. The RDPs will be built during the first phase and rental units will be built during the second phase.All Harry Gwala informal settlement residents will benefit. Those who do not qualify for an RDP house because they might have benefited beforehand or are foreigners, will be accommodated in the rental units.This is the second relocation of Harry Gwala residents. The city said the project will take 18 months to complete.
