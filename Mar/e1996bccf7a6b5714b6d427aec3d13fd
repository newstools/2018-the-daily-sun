EACH time he steps out of the house to take his trucks for a ride, people whistle, cars hoot and kids run and surround him.This is because the colourful toy trucks that Sipho Hadebe, who lives in Inanda, north of Durban, makes are so beautiful. Some of them work with a remote. Sipho (27) has two children who also love the toys. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuSbjVzfori81UzKfr_f7FYXFyw_X8bINwLtoVqvPtYuUXMMWPdP6ATePz3UjrLvZ5fPh_wc0JFcyKwTgmt8BIZpD2fWm2fwCQ2NfSRYLOz3jwusS9keLJ8OetOcGiT3BbqmC0fQiyDF85ATLo9ZR8UoVxbkNSzsLY-YJLvSMNAKdpA4EDOctyNMwspN0wkauVrhyZYr5ZVXCg4ELsDS862e-fE_GG8dW54th3XUSHIfiZquUTDkkIBCZUNaZN8A8R4Oaw59yxnpS5OoeodAMaUny1tfpg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzO2f-WRjY21OEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Some sound like real trucks when moving and even have indicators and hazard lights. He said residents are so impressed by his work that they take photos while others record videos of the trucks that come in different sizes and do different things. He said: “I moved to Inanda to look for a job in 2012. But I couldn’t find one and I wanted to earn an honest living so I started to make the toys to sell.” Sipho makes the cars and trucks from tin, steel and foil.“I get the materials from a shop in Pietermaritzburg. “The busy times for me are during school holidays and the festive season. “When it’s quiet I keep busy by working on electrical appliances,” he said.He said he wasn’t taught to make these cars and trucks. “This is just my talent. While growing up I used to make cars with my friends and we would drive them around. “But my cars were always unique, compared to theirs. Now I have improved and make even better ones,” he said.Sipho’s wish is to get a bigger workshop where he can create his designs.“I wish to have my own place where I can make these cars and sell them. “It would also decrease the high rate of unemployment in our area as I would employ people to work with me.”
