WHILE kids at other schools attend lessons, pupils at Emangadini Primary School spend their days loafing around.Teachers at the school in Umbumbulu, south of Durban, are apparently fighting over who is going to become principal. Daily Sun yesterday learnt that teachers stopped teaching last week after a case was opened against their colleague. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssL1AUsznB66kGWXmrLcJEqwO50iDUNwplAy_VauQ0p3qlt2NXKWxw7eVT2VsT2roOX1f5y1O04fdMZFdSjCLuI_I0_y32wXLfYLXiCrLqfCggOOvyrKoZoz3e7dKhrPq30akbKWKoFanj86U0nBAmvslpehH7wgMMPF4fVUaA3I7BAVtcXpVzzZrAM5X0hsVEFhql6WjRxfE8IMsLOHogvKflqTQXs4Cf4OATkUCmzkWTEAe45FP8DZoxEGWzuCTlj7MuLkOxtpNKT4sR1gSxu4PnOphw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzONSU8HwxsN-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But other teachers want him suspended for making life difficult for his colleague,” said the source. A parent said the education department needed to intervene. SGB members refused to comment. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the matter was being investigated. “The issue of a fight over the principal position is just a rumour,” said Mahlambi. “A rumour shouldn’t cloud the issue of corporal punishment being investigated. “Everyone knows corporal punishment is banned.”Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of assault was opened.
