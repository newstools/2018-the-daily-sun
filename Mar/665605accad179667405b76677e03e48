But other teachers want him suspended for making life difficult for his colleague,” said the source. A parent said the education department needed to intervene. SGB members refused to comment. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the matter was being investigated. “The issue of a fight over the principal position is just a rumour,” said Mahlambi. “A rumour shouldn’t cloud the issue of corporal punishment being investigated. “Everyone knows corporal punishment is banned.”Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of assault was opened.
