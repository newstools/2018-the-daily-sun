My question is: Can I have unprotected sex without passing on the disease?Hey MrThis is a great sign. Having an undetectable viral load decreases chances of transmission.But it does not eliminate the risk. It means you must live a responsible life.The instrument that was used did not detect the virus in your system, but it does not mean that you are now HIV-negative. Condoms are the simplest, most effective method to protect yourself and your partner. Send a Please Call Me to 083 323 1023 or email mizzb@lovelife.org.za to speak to a counsellor.
