Celebs have taken to social media wishing Rick Ross a speedy recovery after the rapper was rushed to hospital in a critical condition.TMZ broke the news that Ross had been rushed to hospital from his home in Miami on Thursday morning after he was reportedly unresponsive and “slobbing at the mouth.”The publication went on to report that the 42-year-old – who has struggled with seizures in the past – was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is a technique used to oxygenate the blood outside of the body before it's pumped back into the body, however Ross’ family have largely denied this.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvVVU8IdgfSpN0hc86HjCQ6LN1pwljqlNKXNx1yw_zyBrHpRMxvS84oy-CzX7MXwnHnR9Rla9KxlTu1rdkHxMY8-zMa3F49ufNp0o-oqctjA7Cy1kJ-3bTwHxvWuO1it2i1lAAPOSuom4Mf3_0A3QPIcoXBHWe19qvT_R3_WYbQxwQQUgGCXYZLKSS6mCC-1Ezf-k8DcJuZMbrdwO_R10K_s0QmobxqIKIdBifz37RsTr8Bgg8mgj7KakVWFKlA4p9_uT4g4R37kzLyZ3zTpsnAuhRt_n-Ort8ofw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNYENAtU9QMjEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
