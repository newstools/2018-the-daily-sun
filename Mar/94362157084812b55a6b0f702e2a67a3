We eat in our bedrooms since they’re far from the doors. The smell is so strong you’d think it’s your food that’s smelling.”The residents say the troublesome drain is always fixed but it never lasts, and usually bursts again after a day or two.Tshepo Morula said cars that drive in the street get splashed with sewage.“You have to drive slowly so that you don’t splash sewage all over your car, but you can be sure that after passing here your car will smell like kak.”Parents have to keep a watchful eye on their children so they do not to play in the smelly sewage water.Mayoral committee member Anda Ntsodo said a member of the City team reported the blockage caused by the rubbish in the street.Said Anda: “Primarily, blockages are caused by the dumping of inappropriate material in the system, such as babies’ nappies, rags and pieces of wood. The system is not meant to handle these materials and therefore it gets blocked.He also said that most of the time it’s a member of staff from the City that reports blockages. “We urge our communities not to throw materials that cause blockages into our system. The situation can really be avoided. We’ll continue to do our best to respond to such matters and to educate our residents.” The City promised to send a team to remove the material causing the trouble.
