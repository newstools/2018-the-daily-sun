One is tempted to ask ‘could it be that whoever wins on Saturday will challenge for the championship? Possibly, yes,” said Chiefs coach Steve Komphela.“I haven’t been involved in a derby where positions havebeen at stake. We have to win to get an advantage from a points perspective and close the gap on Mamelodi Sundowns. Are we close enough? Yes, we are. “Sundowns will be going into the Caf competition. They have a big squad but their schedule will be taxing. That’s why I say the team that wins the derby stands a chance.”Amakhosi have dropped to third in the table with 35 points, one adrift of Pirates, but they still trail pacesetters Sundowns by five points with eight matches left.Bucs coach Milutin Sredojevic agrees, saying the derby could go some way towards defining the season for his team. However, he added that they would gain a psychological boost from winning the match.“Mathematically it’s the three points, but you also gain something mentally if you win a game of this magnitude. And mathematically it is possible to not get the best out of this game and still win the league. But it’ll be much harder that way.”The two antagonists dismissed any talk of “parking the bus”, Sredojevic describing his approach as “James Bond” style, where they attack with seven players and defend with seven.Pirates have been at pains to play down their title ambitions. But Chiefs defender Ramahlwe Mphahlele rubbished the claim that Bucs were not title contenders.“I heard Happy Jele lying, saying they are not thinking about the league. What are they thinking about if not the league?” he said yesterday.A shy Jele did not hit back, merely saying: “We are focused on winning the derby.”Like this story?
