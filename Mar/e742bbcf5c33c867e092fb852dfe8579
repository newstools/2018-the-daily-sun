her  before robbing her an amount of
R1000 which she had kept in her purse. The accused left her for the dead and proceeded to a
local tavern where he bought liquor and partied with his friends. He was arrested a week later and charged with murder and
robbery In aggravation of sentence, Advocate Ratshilumela Makhera
submitted that the murder was premeditated and was made worse by the fact that
it was a gruesome attack on a vulnerable elderly person who was
defenseless.  Makhera emphasized that the deceased was attacked in her
sanctuary where she least expected to be attacked. Judge Nare Kgomo has sentenced the accused to life
imprisonment plus eight years for the house breaking with intent to rob and
robbery.The DPP, Advocate Ivy Thenga commended the investigating
team, state witnesses and advocate Makhera for their persistence in ensuring
that the accused is duly punished for the senseless killing of the old woman.
