COPS at Philippi East Police Station have been busy cleaning out the containers used to store stolen goods.Station commander Colonel Bongani Mtakati said they would burn dagga and put other items such as TVs and copper cables up for auction. “The things we are going to put on auction are those that were never claimed by the owners,” said Mtakati. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu2jeZN-iwQphqETgh5zOC_46SYFJvsH71sGgkpGMkjl7l3dMSrtdw9brq9feiawHGowTKtGB4qMsq62ViZ32q1-6D_VHwsArrSEdmW81nxw4PLmb0b85YHUxRV3rhbSIn-2ko8LxId-fg6JbdzAs34QOw9YW-mlPRlfNnINpQl70HQmmiAe6wme5hDDYk_2j5YOZg2LPIVDAbjzmshMuTBUqXsBn6eSrmPPP2PTStILZSMyZHDg0RKU4ZIYwdbXGeAaQRF3GKVVqkSRlzlQiVB73rGtiQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzG2UWhLyT8RoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We don’t have a right to use or take that money,” he said.Mtakati said when they recover stolen items they first try to find the owners before selling them. “If we fail to find the owners then we put things on auction as we can’t keep then here forever,” he said.Mtakati said some of the items were used as evidence during court proceedings so they are only sold or destroyed once the case is closed. “When people come forward to claim goods, the first thing we ask for is the serial number. We can’t just give these things to anyone who claims they belong to them,” said Mtakati.He urged Philippi residents to work with the police to make the community a better, safer place. “For us to make a difference to this community, residents must work with us.” Mtakati was appointed to his position by former police minister Fikile Mbalula after the mass killing of 11 people in Marikana last year.
