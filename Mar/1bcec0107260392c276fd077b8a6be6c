They survived the earlier pressure after countless shots from within and outside the box, with Denis Onyango called into the action on numerous occasions ensuring his side stay on the game.Arendse converted a well taken set-piece by Percy Tau bringing relief to Pitso Msimane and his bench, following an early scare from the visitors.The second goal came after a good work from Gaston Sirino, who rattled the crossbar before Vilakazi finished off the move on the rebound for his first goal the tournament on 55 minutes with a flying header.The Uruguayan fed another sublime delivery into the path of Tau who managed to bring the best out of the Burundian shot-stopper.The away outfit were reduced to 10 men late on after Caleb Bimenyamina saw red for a two-footed challenge on Tebogo Langerman in added time, but by then Sundowns were home and dry as the won the tie 2-0 on aggregate.
