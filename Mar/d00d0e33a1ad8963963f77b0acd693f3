She added that incorrect billing issues will be also be resolved. “Those who fall within the brackets of incapable or unable to pay should visit the municipal regional offices where they will be registered as indigents.” Meanwhile, the troubled municipality is also facing a severe water shortage.  Municipal spokesman Aubrey Mnisi told Daily Sun: “We received information from the Rand Water Board that raw water pumps at Injaka Dam are not working properly. “Only two pumps are operational. This means the operation is at 50%.  “We urge residents to remain patient and use water sparingly.” Mnisi added that the matter is receiving urgent attention and the water board is working around the clock to resolve the problem.
