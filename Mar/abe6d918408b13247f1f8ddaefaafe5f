unless declined by families.” This comes after
the State argued that it only wanted to pay for damages amounting to R200 000.Moseneke rejected this.He said there was no doubt that constitutional rights
were bridged in this regard.Over 1700 mentally-ill patients were moved to
ill-equipped NGOs after the Gauteng Department of Health terminated its
contract with the Life Esidimeni Group. This resulted into
the death of 144 patients because of dehydration and hunger according to the
health ombudsman report.“Besides the reasons of the termination being untruthful
it was also irrational,” said Moseneke.He said the evidence provided before the hearing by the
former Health MEC, Qedani Mahlangu, the Head of Department, Dr Barney Selebano
and the former head of mental unit, Dr Makgabo Manamela were irrational and
arrogance of public power.“All we can hope for is that one day the true reason for
the termination of the contract will see the day."
