“SHUT down these routes until they have become sober.”This was what Police Minister Bheki Cele told Eastern Cape cops when he visited the routes which the Border Alliance and Uncedo taxi associations have been fighting over since 2016. Speaking in Mthatha yesterday, Cele said the taxi routes on the R61 between Mthatha and Port St Johns, and the N2 between Mthatha and Tsolo, would be closed. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst5tR3luZazSHzws-BoAA1v0sVBLe0vFHuOmPcTqSTHoal7hiNihamtakfVQm5mIJTLuUULW8Z6JTxzkaB7EDvlCp2FDv3ejQAGGw-RXYIuO9IHYNsGKQAMw6yaa36qhRDhNbwGFpMLZxc7teBFQ7f2L_Jd0iAsdivjnwNUozUzvgYCZjz09MzsXMu4DbxlHQZsYiY4DASTUPzOAsaZGbyuozJ3oYsZgyXUfQkjsWfYvfM6S9YLtjT9gPstlQZ07wF53Ii69sa4aAvvwvigbIWrppvdgeo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGXY79CE0FMCEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I asked the leaders of the associations what needed to be done but they are not sure – so the government had to take a decision,” he said. “The provincial leadership had 20 meetings with the associations’ bosses to try to resolve the issues. The last person was killed on Friday. We are not in a war zone, so we have to act and shut down the routes where people are killed.” Cele said if the taxi bosses wanted to take the government to court, they could. “We are going to fight on behalf of the people who were killed by people who are greedy and selfish.”Vusumzi Mbewu secretary general of Border alliance said they hoped that the meeting Cele was going to bring a solution.“We respect the decision of the minister and we agree that people must not die that is not our wish.”However Uncedo service taxi association chief of staff Zola Yolelo said :“We were excepting that he will sit down and we have discussion. This will affect our businesses badly. The fight was not about the routes that are now closed. The problem here is about Border alliance that is monopolising the R61 route that belongs to government.” Mbewu responded to Yolelo claims of monopolising the R61 route saying they were trying to work together.
