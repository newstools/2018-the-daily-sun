Moreover, it will enable the telecommunications company – which is a leading supplier of internet services in the Ivorian market – to offer its almost 11 million subscribers access to exclusive content related to the Spanish competition. Said Barradas: "Africa is a strategic continent for LaLiga, because of its fans and its many different talented players. Many Ivorian footballers such as Yaya Toure, Romaric, Didier Zokora, Arouna Kone, Eric Bailly, and in the present day, Cheick Doukoure at Levante UD, have left their mark on the best football league in the world. Since then, Africa has become an essential venue for LaLiga, both to give and to receive." Meanwhile, of MTN Ivory general manager Coast Freddy Tchala said: "We are proud to launch this partnership with LaLiga. This is a major step for MTN Ivory Coast in its mission to offer the benefits of a connected modern life to Ivorians. "This alliance brings one of the biggest leagues in the world to our subscribers, who will get the opportunity to see their stars and experience one of their dreams coming true."Under this agreement, MTN Ivory Coast gains the marketing rights for exclusive content from the 20 clubs participating in the Spanish top flight.Following the deal, the telecom firm intends to reward the loyalty of its passionate football-watching subscribers through exclusive content, giveaways and prize draws. This partnership further illustrates LaLiga's successful international expansion in Africa, which is a key market for the Spanish institution, and will help the competition to get closer to its Ivorian fans.
