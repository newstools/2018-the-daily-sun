DOROTHY Mangonyane was always passionate about breeding sheep, so she bought her own livestock and started to farm.Dorothy (60), from Mandela Park kasi in Clocolan, said she inherited a knowledge of sheep farming from her father, who used to teach agriculture.“He taught me what is needed for a sheep to survive in winter and in summer and about all kinds of medicines,” she said. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstJ2CbdE-4sNcvwhE4yvf8jsK8iz376eL4t8eFUYTFrzBqSB9hg6sqM3fh6pNPV2kUCpRujO8PvH5hrGxHNZdCjAIChjbVA7H0ewcSNGgWbfzhD5XiO4yDq6n3U6LYjWPO0evX48nHEpgTD-bU7tYW4GwKmfDeliNkfievxnJ-dFzN97I1Ud5UGr76FE-3YLWhCqfwOG-gCraGdAIl4PAtUR6OZK7PzHHk_yxanHGCvxPCUaEd4OKPymcVZIP-Rxb8aoA1X0HK7WwmO1QgV1QpbyNbPf9s\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIphlzBsebUhEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I started breeding and selling them to provide for the family. I rented a plot outside the town where I kept my sheep. “I used to wake up early in the morning to go to the plot to look after them. But then they started being stolen. “After breeding them, I had 100 sheep. After some were stolen, they were reduced to 70. “I had no choice but to make a kraal in front of my house where I could monitor them closely. “But thugs keep on stealing them. It’s hard to fight livestock theft but we do our best to keep our sheep safe.“ I am now left with 39 sheep, which I believe will never be stolen because I have tightened security. I want to have my own land so I can breed more to sell to abattoirs and butcheries and empower local women. I urge women to farm and stop believing it’s for men only. I’m happy I can provide for my family.”
