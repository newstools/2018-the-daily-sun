DOROTHY Mangonyane was always passionate about breeding sheep, so she bought her own livestock and started to farm.Dorothy (60), from Mandela Park kasi in Clocolan, said she inherited a knowledge of sheep farming from her father, who used to teach agriculture.“He taught me what is needed for a sheep to survive in winter and in summer and about all kinds of medicines,” she said. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuIztuo0H8cXuJ9qvAtlzKQk3UHfh_DO9-J1fGS_eWt6WS6qpQC8shCtn7zAQ2tQHt2Cc0Y1DX_vXIPqFCY1xz4KlRm_ZEj2yNkUkeuzeu_oc66RAw5PaRNYhlVecpUtV83JoYYRTxjpFKImqk8sxgZEOufGdZGOuJQa1HxDF40dr4GcUbdjVadULaPAwEjq2cgxKKr9NHiV2QCrAk1o7g39bF8TA7BgUP8b6_qMpTTq-dwOjzPrVWRd1yyAj5fxxjfHNVampYFEDxumKFgTTHzHLzbR38\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAT4f-bSzcQUEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I started breeding and selling them to provide for the family. I rented a plot outside the town where I kept my sheep. “I used to wake up early in the morning to go to the plot to look after them. But then they started being stolen. “After breeding them, I had 100 sheep. After some were stolen, they were reduced to 70. “I had no choice but to make a kraal in front of my house where I could monitor them closely. “But thugs keep on stealing them. It’s hard to fight livestock theft but we do our best to keep our sheep safe.“ I am now left with 39 sheep, which I believe will never be stolen because I have tightened security. I want to have my own land so I can breed more to sell to abattoirs and butcheries and empower local women. I urge women to farm and stop believing it’s for men only. I’m happy I can provide for my family.”
