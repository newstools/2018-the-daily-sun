AT least 64 people were killed by a fire which engulfed a
busy shopping mall in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, Russian investigators said
today, and some of the dead were children.The fire, one of the deadliest in Russia since the
break-up of the Soviet Union, swept through the upper floors of the “Winter
Cherry” shopping centre on Sunday afternoon where a cinema complex and
children’s play area were located.Emergency services said they had extinguished the blaze,
but later said it had reignited, and that rescuers were struggling to reach the
building’s upper floors because the roof had collapsed. TV footage today showed
thick black smoke rising from the yellow building.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstr4BE4xfIDScGu8T7d05eA0TOEJYtDaB6yS5R52PjC-4Jz84htn6gozttQBLtZxMIYGF0no7I0_1oCNkR1C2OlZWAs9iA3eKd_0hHMU-Wzo7nTpcoP_QkXSqCCUezJ7q1wjpCfMhFBEmufnK1_EqncoJxHac5ibbeW1OvT9_wFjAD6eT3FOyUvp4ktsJoT4gtitPIDqu2bexW9lgq3M5MuZ7K39xIZQ1QEVcDD2sLcRb7T-W2izJpexGz9OeT62EYl3AftBM9wvzSvvDzKfHDCXifVxodRLsiXiA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDOrBO90KcNqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

but 11 people were being treated in hospital, including an 11-year-old boy who
was in a serious condition.Earlier today, people posted appeals on social media
seeking news of their relatives or friends, and authorities set up a centre in
a school near the mall to deal with inquiries.Anna Kuznetsova, Russia’s children’s rights commissioner,
said the fire had been caused by incompetence and warned there were many
similar shopping centres.“Other regions, the bosses of other malls must right now,
without waiting for (routine) checks, ask themselves: Have we done everything
we can to ensure something like this doesn’t happen here,” Kuznetsova said in a
statement.Witnesses were quoted by Russian media as saying that the
fire alarm had failed to go off, and that many people had found themselves
trapped because exit doors were locked.Video footage from inside the mall after the fire broke
out showed a group of people in a smoke-filled staircase trying to smash a fire
exit door, which was jammed.Russia’s Channel One TV station reported that some people
had jumped from upper windows to escape the flames.State investigators, who have opened a criminal
investigation into the blaze, said four people had been detained over the fire,
including the owners and lessees of outlets inside the mall. Russia’s
Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes, said it was trying to
bring in the mall’s owner for questioning.The Interfax news agency cited an unnamed local official
source as saying the main theory being looked at was that the fire had been
caused by an electrical short circuit.However, it quoted Vladimir Chernov, the region’s deputy
governor, as saying on Sunday that the blaze had started when a child had set
fire to the foam on a trampoline in a play area using a lighter.
