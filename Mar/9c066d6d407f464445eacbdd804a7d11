I will regret that decision for the rest of my life.”Nelly hasn’t seen her child for seven long months. She said her baby daddy, Javed Mohammed told her over the phone that she should go and make another baby because she would never see her child again. “Last week, I went to the Indian consulate in Joburg but I was sent from pillar to post. I also went to Mara Police Station here at home to open a case but there’s nothing they can do because I agreed to leave my son behind.” A staff member at the Indian consulate in Joburg said they were aware of the matter. “She must come here herself so she can be helped,” she said.
