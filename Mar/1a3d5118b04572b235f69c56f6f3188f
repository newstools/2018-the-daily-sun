AFTER the school was abandoned many years ago, some classrooms were taken over by a church group and others by nyaope smokers. 
However, the uneasy peace between the two groups recently ended and now they’re at war. The nyaope boys claim the church group won’t let them smoke in peace, and they have started having loud sex while the Christians are praying! if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstLkgQ05Q9nsPaBq_oYn83B3wBY3sH7_bneWYbEB0RgTvV52lNMeGXEZr4gsfCotELdjuKmF6aFqUYiHi9PRhU31BNQp6Bmgg2eJTrFunIjdFsxuLFFU-t9zk9xKAnlppo5hGlzUhHSjr5feAkmUfy8yJ7bVJ10zyHOcbIEw0JbRz-FwPSd9y4h4VMwC0ltyJD7te_J4VBNM-KUeAm3tw52ssaQ4iLgzWUkFPru1cMUK8IQ9kyNoSFD8qyX1wcgtbBYEIpmhlXsYFjpc_G6Pvsb996c98o\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAq7tVYBPlY0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Ndlovu said sometimes they could hear thugs removing windows and doors. “We wish the government could open the school again.” When the SunTeam visited the school, it was obvious it had become a paradise for thugs. Magdeline Notshe, who lives near the school, said: “We find wallets and bags there.” George Kgomo said they heard the screams of women at night. “We wish the government could do something about the school,” he said. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said school buildings were the responsibility of the department of infrastructure. Gauteng Infrastructure Development MEC Jacob Mamabolo said they planned to work with the private sector to find a use for the abandoned school building.
