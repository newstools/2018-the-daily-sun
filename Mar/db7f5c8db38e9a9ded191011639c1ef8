And there are several mouth-watering Nedbank Cup clashes on the cards.The pick of the cup fixtures is undoubtedly the showdown between Mamelodi Sundowns and Cape Town City, who meet at Cape Town Stadium on Sunday (3pm).if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuYkVN3JglrrDUEUXBnVBXMZcj_TsyT03DK_fqOEfmFSgtyjaoDADz2ZgBKYLjnik633GUwfIxTMDZyQ3-A5TBQzQOkVflN2gXQ0fCjThw7I8l9enzVTT3HOAAYr5HtTG9wNAWnfXGIIl_zbbyBQY6S9etop17XntSwEswiCLgCxiXCeL1Vu7sINJ4NVEpSHRyAE2ODcUUAELNMJsHtaf3vjJdsQl8ci5ihXzg42gwKKxc2hn6CuEsCqZ1mJQEw4teB1339iVMFu-znLrddBxUYkA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCHula99F4wDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Fireworks,” said Mosimane “In football you are as good as your last game. We are playing against a really good team with lots of experience. They know how to play with and without the ball. Benni (McCarthy) has a good understanding of the game. He’s played at the highest level in Europe.” But Mosimane backs his players to crack McCarthy’s tough nuts, recalling Percy Tau’s brilliance when Downs edged the Citizens 1-0 in the league. “They really gave us a hard time the last time. But we are experienced and have lots of individual brilliance. Percy took four players on and provided the assist the last time . . . (Sibusiso) Vilakazi scored two goals against AmaZulu. You can’t compare Percy with anyone. Give him the Player of the Season award already. He deserves it.”Amakhosi have already lost to Baroka as well as beating them in the league but coach Steve Komphela acknowledges knockout competitions offer no second chance: “It’s a once-off. You’ll never win a knockout match without attacking. “If you want to win a knockout match you have to go out and attack. Win the match 3-2, 4-2. In the league you may be looking at a whole other set of dynamics, goal difference . . . points. But in this one we have to go for the jugular.”
