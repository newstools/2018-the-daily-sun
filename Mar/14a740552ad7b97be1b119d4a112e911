The department said Atul was naturalised in November 2002 and Rajesh in July 2006. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the department stood by director-general Mkuseli Apleni’s statement that the Guptas were naturalised before Malusi Gigaba first became minister of the department. “We don’t have a statement regarding Ajay other than that director-general Mkuseli Apleni released on Sunday,” he said.The Sunday Times said Gigaba had instructed Apleni to investigate how Ajay obtained a residence permit and to seek legal advice about how to withdraw it. Gigaba’s instructions came after he met President Cyril Ramaphosa to discuss his statements on Atul Gupta’s citizenship.
