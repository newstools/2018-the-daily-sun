ORLANDO Pirates have continued with their impressive form thumping Kaizer Chiefs 3-1 in the Absa Premiership Soweto derby keeping their title hopes alive.Pirates made few surprising changes from a team that thumped Chippa United 4-2 last weekend with Siyabonga Mpontshane replacing Jackson Mabokgwane in the posts as well as Xola mlambo starting the match with Gladwin Shitolo.Mpontshane only started the match in the Pirates goals because of a last minute knee injury to Mabokgwane.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstqKuxeIIkJkn2dbnEkI23-IV9TKDpkACOefXOEo9HiKimW_C3AxnzAnZLZp34pUo6epSJJDFP4EjgjHhaOwOwy7gRVj85RzbP92Fc38y2vPqxY-VtdTAijOPFpVSeTcFSff-azcEIvcUbW0UT6FhVfaFSqmqJ0MXkhUvMU2bR67HAL5XaMUZ3etYFZZfhHcN8RkrXcA-an4JLqU-6UuYG6wzgvGPfaxrQA593tuTO5PndI_oRKqdOQKrIBEQRtXl8YcnfNFyg7mh_znSMPSS6ULg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMdeE5enc1tfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
