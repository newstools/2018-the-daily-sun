She teaches informal traders and spaza shop owners how to do business.“We’re going into different communities, particularly rural areas and townships, targeting informal traders because they’re a very big part of economic growth,” she said. “South Africa has a high rate of unemployment and, as a result, we encourage entrepreneurship.”Business owners who have been operating for a long time said they have nothing to show for it.“Mkhuseli Jara (44) from Samora Machel said Somali spaza owners do better than him.Philippi Black Business Chamber deputy president Xamela Ndesi urged Shingange’s organisation to open offices in Philippi and Khayelitsha to be closer to kasi businesses.
