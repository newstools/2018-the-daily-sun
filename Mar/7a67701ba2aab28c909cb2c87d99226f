Although the company is doing well, Sipho said it was not easy to get it off the ground.“I tried to launch Phillipi TV in 2003, but it didn’t succeed. When I gave it another shot in 2010, I failed again. “It only got off the ground in 2015 when I bought a small camera and shot a short film called Icebo (A Plan). “I screened for free and the people in my kasi said they wanted more. That’s how the thing started,” he said.The company relies entirely on the community for resources. When they need to shoot a scene inside a house, they do so at a resident’s house because they can’t afford to hire a set.“Because we work with the community, we have to do something for them. “That’s why we decided to open a cinema for kasi residents.”
