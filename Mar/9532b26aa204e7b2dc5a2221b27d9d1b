ACCORDING to Julius Malema, farmers have been approaching
banks to get money in exchange for their land.The leader of the EFF was speaking at the Standard Bank
Arena in Joburg during the party’s election registration campaign yesterday.Addressing EFF members in the packed arena, Malema said:
“Fellow fighters, I got a call from a senior employee of a bank. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstyGBJbdRxI6EM8LuP9UK57XSe4-KgliLZzlOrJqpXIZzDe03WcJrYgbzCsGPGfcjGkp8S_e_Wq0wc-yj4jaPL5NIK-vZAmWg6WF5PWowqOd1JqXSuh5jAYdLT0OcnxwO97DUJK4ngbriyA3xS3uiKl55-gEz41CtB-HN6EZUKCtw6XGArlXruObRY2HNsi23v2x0vMHTMUJpsSn8TC1fx80ByHgPp-1Lpo7yZhHlt0rM8X5MBN1aMxLfoXbskER07Q0ZoWygV_GRtBRkQ48bkCC58JQlw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMX6G4TMXynCEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

farms to the banks.” Malema said they were doing this so they could say they were
not the owners of land when farms are expropriated without compensation. “They are working with South African banks to cheat the
expropriation of land without compensation,” he said. He warned the banks that the government won’t grant bonds
for farms mortgaged after December. Malema also said 6 April could be Athol Trollip’s last day
as mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay as the EFF had decided they wanted him out. He said this was because the DA refused to vote with his
party in parliament in favour of expropriation without compensation. “The mayor of Port Elizabeth is a white man. When you want
to hit these people hard, go for the white man. We’re cutting the throat of
whiteness,” he said. “We don’t hate white people. We just love black people,
that’s all. That’s who we are.” Malema hinted that the EFF would put the ANC in power in
Nelson Mandela Bay if someone like former deputy minister Mcebisi Jonas was
chosen to become mayor. The EFF has called on its members to register to vote next
week.
