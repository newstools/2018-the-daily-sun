In turn, LaLiga will benefit from increased exposure in Cameroon and tap into the LFPC's knowledge of the local football scene and the behaviour of Cameroonian fans. These insights are considered vital given that Cameroon is one of the strategic growth markets earmarked by LaLiga, whose LaLiga Global Network project has helped target such locations. A deeper understanding of local circumstances and customs will allow LaLiga to better tailor its content to the tastes of Cameroonian supporters and boost engagement.“Cameroon has long been an extremely important source of talent for LaLiga. We have had, and continue to have, some fantastic Cameroonian players and now, thanks to this agreement, we want to build on the existing fine relationship between us by taking it into the realm of sports administration. These sorts of collaborations and knowledge-sharing initiatives with local leagues are of massive importance to us,” said LaLiga president Tebas.For his part, the LFPC president, Mr Semengue, noted: "I'm delighted about this collaboration, which will enable our league to continue its development and professionalisation. Moreover, it's an honour to sign such an agreement with one of the biggest leagues out there, which is home to some of the top clubs in the world. Here at the Cameroonian league, we're looking forward to the multidisciplinary support we are going to receive from LaLiga."The MoU has been signed at what is a crucial juncture for the beautiful game in Cameroon, with the onus on the industry to carry on professionalising as the country prepares to stage the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. The successful hosting of this event and management of its legacy, including the associated new stadiums and infrastructure improvements, are key issues at play in this process.This is just the latest in a long line of agreements that LaLiga has forged with federations and governing bodies across the world, including the South African Football Association (SAFA), the Colombian league (Dimayor) and the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM), among others. These partnerships attest to LaLiga’s firm commitment to teaming up with local institutions to help professionalise football across the globe.
