Africa said four people have been killed on the Western Cape roads this weekend. Among those who died were two drivers, a pedestrian and a cyclist. He said about 15 drivers were arrested for drunk driving while two others were arrested for possession of dagga. Africa said the cyclist was taking part in the Cape Town Cycle Tour yesterday. Africa said the cyclist, who was 40 years old, was involved in a pile-up of about 20 other race participants.This happened in the suburb of Constantia.
