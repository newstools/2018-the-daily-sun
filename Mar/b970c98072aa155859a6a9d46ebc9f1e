My new home is also quiet and I’ll be able to read books,” said Samuel.Lita said they were grateful to the human settlements department officials who considered her husband’s disability when the house was built. “They called and asked about the size of the wheelchair before we moved in.” Another beneficiary, Anna Sithole (55), said she had been moved three times because her shack was on the river bank and she’d lost most of her belongings. “Most of my things have been destroyed. This house means a new start for me,” she said.Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Uhuru Moiloa said: “The allocation of houses is in line with the department’s commitment to prioritise the elderly who applied in 1996, people living with disabilities and child-headed households.“Riverside View Mega City is a true example of good use of space because RDP flats were also built. “In the RDP flats, we allocate the ground floor to the elderly and people living with disabilities, while the upper floors are allocated to child-headed households and younger people.”
