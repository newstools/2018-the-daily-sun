PEOPLE across Mzansi are living in fear of the deadly Listeria bacteria. Since Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi confirmed on Sunday that the source of the Listeriosis outbreak was an Enterprise facility in Polokwane, retailers have removed processed cold meat from their shelves. But people told Daily Sun a store at Protea Point Shopping Centre, Soweto, was still selling Russians, polony and viennas. A shocked customer said: “They want to kill us and for us to buy these products just because they’re cheap.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuPDvmOx678sh5mG9NxcRSGQ9tIgn-xoYBtjUsgRJ9xcof2tGREWrMFFsH2OQlKs3WnelP3GkDOFy63X5SdtGr-HHLFLLnWRhiAaH8Ip0BvJ4RCkZUkProtBwg_1T-36A2kCEwkOA8Ne__vLtLrP7G6f-2JWDUpOjtwD6AtQXXgp-UGXJ-22qAXkGJ_ZgDPdQlSijxEDLBOKlcikDkI3qUeHIwge9XrKmEsIzPpdEZmrTjwzo46ETbEP-ukog2jvnCP0StDMl6EgkyRtwJcLJtogtdAiX8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCW7FcH0f8IKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The manager said none of the products on their shelves were from Enterprise. The Manager Dumisani Hlaiseka said: “We removed all Enterprise food products, as well as Rainbow Chicken. We even refunded customers who brought back products.” He said the cold meat on their shelves were Eskort and home brands. Eskort said the virus had not been traced to their products, which is why we still have their products.” Escort’s website said both their plants had food safety certification and control systems to prevent bacteria from spreading.
