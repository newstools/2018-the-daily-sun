But since Monday, it’s like being in a new place. The noise is gone and we don’t have to read lips when having conversations,” he said. Mazwi was worried about his kids’ future. They had been struggling to do their homework because of the noise. “When my kids came back from school on Monday, they were surprised that the noise was over. “I was over the moon when I saw the huge truck take away the generator on Tuesday,” he said. An official from the telecommunications company, Joshua Kock, said they removed the generator. “We have connected our pole to the Eskom supply instead,” he said.
