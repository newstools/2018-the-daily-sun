IT’S been a week since the budget speech and many pensioners are excited about their increase. But this isn’t the case for gogo Rosina Kekana from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, whose pension has been R200 short every month since 2016. The gogo said people came to her house claiming to be from Sassa and made her sign a document she didn’t read. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssrajsmBtcWZzZL0hDWk0UtUNHYZabR-Z1xX6K406iEgJUy4IHnEXQS2gMehQFNi1V7a0b_SWPwn4izSdMd1dVpJM3Ab_nlnuC-2ho-jEkDroEeeahyncs9YdPXjyM_vBL1RV4RPIPojL1Ojcm0T2b27_WIS8BB7kLmTQsXtfVJoHd_D5dexvUF2l-_WhwIhCi1aayxsG7HjDA7--imFIYvg2RhPKR7LqUhPZjn7c3Bj1lZ4lbWB3YBgOWYGAc2zSH-ijRDEl44Xvtu_2_pGkXwpZ9JCqI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzF8zA7MmmC8qEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

My daughter called Sassa and they said they couldn’t do anything because we signed the documents,” she said. Rosina’s daughter managed to trace the people taking the money. They were undertakers. TranAfrica Life Funeral Policy employee Eunice Mahlangu confirmed that Rosina had a life cover policy with them. “She is covered for R20 000. We started deducting the money in May 2016,” she said. Asked why the agents claimed to be from Sassa, she said: “I don’t know what they were told to say.“But if she wants to cancel her policy she must go to the police station and state in an affidavit she wants to cancel and fax it to us.”
