reincarnation of the Indian monkey-god, Lord Hanuman.His mum, Nanda Bangari (35) is quoted as saying: "He
plays with them, feeds them home-cooked food. The monkeys love him and even
when he pulls their tails, the animals do not harm him."People in our village are shocked to see Samarth's
special bond with the monkeys and some even call him as the incarnation of Lord
Hanuman because of the monkeys who show immense love for him."They look after him and don't hurt him ever. I
trust the animals and leave my son alone with them to play while I get busy
with household chores."
