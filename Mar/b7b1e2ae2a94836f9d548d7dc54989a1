Last week, five-year-old Lumka Mketwa fell into a pit toilet and drowned at Luna Primary School in Bizana, Eastern Cape. In 2014, Michael Komape, who was also five, drowned in a toilet at Mahlodumela Primary in Limpopo. Motshekga said Lumka’s death was a reminder of the sanitation challenges faced by pupils at schools. “We urgently assessed the extent of delivery to enhance and accelerate the provision of adequate and safe sanitation. “We need to ensure we provide safe and dignified sanitation to all our schools as a matter of urgency,” she said.She said the audit would also include schools where overcrowding led to inadequate sanitation. It would also include a plan to demolish pit toilets at schools that have been provided with flush toilets. Motshekga said in rural areas where it wasn’t possible to provide flushing toilets, the department would look at alternative technology. “We need to continue to utilise advanced and innovative technology solutions where water is scarce.” The minister said they would work with police and Lumka’s parents to ensure her death was properly investigated.
