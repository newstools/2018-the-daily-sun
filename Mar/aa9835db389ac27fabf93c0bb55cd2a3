“WE NEED to prevent cops from accepting bribes because the police are defined by our worst examples.” These were the words of new Joburg Metro police chief David Tembe. He was speaking in Nasrec, Joburg, after being sworn in by Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange on Tuesday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstyqIxArAiXDCfSK4DEfV6R6LXXFKoOf_1WctM4-jwVs2m2Oh7ElRoB-Rz9uU5C9hSDkAwY200y5gmoP2elUQaSNJzQP20VGfixKztBo-1YIbufYjZLUOYwNzSll9BSNiUb-Nu0juL2knivA4AiDZr_5POHYkX65-3gvl9Of1jiF66CtejflMrwJm5J9Zku6cBvE9wSGUlg9d5nsXknVFTUkQHqDcn7GdSz9F3dqqo_ZdymdLOFlF23Q_7aPrnofAfSjv0pSPuf6N1L2ocXsCrs-_hMpC4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzO7LUsL0XromEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Everybody who talks about us mentions it and that should come to an end,” said Tembe. He told the officers he expected integrity, competence and commitment from them.“I commit myself to getting you proper training and equipment. I believe you became officers because you care about the communities in this city. I promise to foster an environment that makes the City of Joburg an employer of choice.” Tembe said Metro police commanders must create a system that will recognise the good work done by officers. “Honest mistakes will be dealt with differently than misconduct. I expect your directors to relay your advice to me and to work for the future of this department.”
