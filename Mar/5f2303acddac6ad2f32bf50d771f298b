is lying in the bushes near Ga-Phaahla village and immediately went to  inspect.

He was then taken to hospital for medical treatment
where he is under police guard.

Ngoepe said the police preliminary investigations
have also revealed that the getaway Audi A4 that was recovered, was reported
stolen in the Garsfontein area.

 The same car
is also connected to the cash-in-transit robbery which occurred at the
Bloemfontein Airport in the Free State Province in January this year.

The incident took place on midday Sunday, when the
cash-in-transit security officers were on their way to fix ATM's.

Ngoepe said the security officers retaliated and in
the process, one suspect was fatally wounded and the other two were seriously
injured but their accomplices loaded them into the get-away car before they
fled the scene with a white Audi A4.

Anyone with information which can lead to the arrest of these
remaining suspects especially those who can see people with the gunshot wounds
visiting any hospital to contact Captain Richard Boshomane at 079 894 5501.
