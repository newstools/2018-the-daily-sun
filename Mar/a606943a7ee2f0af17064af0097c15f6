Cricket South Africa (CSA) then had 48 hours to appeal the decision, and confirmed yesterday afternoon that it had done so. The ICC now has 48 hours to appoint a Judicial Commissioner, and after that is done, the hearing must take place within seven days.“As mentioned, Kagiso remains suspended unless the appointed JC finds enough reason to allow him to play in the third Test,” a CSA official confirmed. If Rabada is cleared of the Smith charge, the one demerit point he accepted from an incident with David Warner in the second Test will not be enough to see him suspended. The third Test in Cape Town starts on 22 March. – SPORT24
