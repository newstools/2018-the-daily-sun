BIDVEST  Wits' Gavin Hunt and Lehlohonolo Majoro have bagged the Absa Premiership coach and player of the month awards for February.Majoro, had a tough time after joining the students as he struggled to find the back of the net in January, but he found his mojo in February, as he bagged four goals.Three of the four goals Majoro scored last month were against his former sides Kaizer Chiefs and City. The goal against Amakhosi, in fact, was his first goal for the Clever Boys which inspired him to then score against Golden Arrows and City. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuoV6zFDwvWOKu3TJa9lImLHSwPdtEyKPhtGvJ6HULRTSmpmM4zjIQUlZa1loJdT7JTe06smxfaD8jS1ZMbq4FkEV6RG8Ijn3Iday1PGXxmb8blo2KD9HMbJ4tDNJFwR4M0qSUbunD7Mv7edH6xycn6azHl7XewFANXEkSZwUcfydAWuAo2hRVqurc5Yh6kiRYTNRV-FDsSrnJDKk8BNe0YJaN7NJ_3yKIuL10yOmi5Fo0Jg0GlOvt3zGPbzW8HsBRT_yyt-WOvr4KuhEN1NA5qzA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzN_HzcKCeZrDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Wits were seen as one of the favourites to lift the title after winning it for the first time last term, but the defence of their crown has been a disaster. Wits won two matches and drew once last month. After winning the award, Hunt will be hoping he can inspire his side to a top eight finish.Kaizer Chiefs striker, Leonardo Castro has won the Absa Premiership Goal of the Month award for January for his debut goal when Chiefs defeated Baroka FC  2-1.Castro’s well taken half volley on the edge of the 18-yard area on debut for his new club, helped Chiefs clinch the come-from-behind victory against their hoodoo opponents at the new Peter Mokaba stadium on 21 January.
