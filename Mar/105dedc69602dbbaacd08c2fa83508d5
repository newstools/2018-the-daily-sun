I like him. He has the definition of happiness on the pitch. "In Brazil, football is everything, it's life in Brazil. Everyone plays football. I love to see him on the pitch playing, with his technique and his ability. It's a different style. "When you say the word 'Neymar' around the world, everyone knows who he is and what he does. Therefore if I could play with him one day, it would be a pleasure." He added: "When I was smaller I always looked up to Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo. I had videos of Maradona, Pele, Chris Waddle, Kaka - many players. I wanted to have all the virtues of those players. "Now I look more at players like Andres Iniesta, Yaya Toure, Kevin De Bruyne and Luke Modric - who is a very strong midfielder player. I look at them to try to be better." SPORT24
