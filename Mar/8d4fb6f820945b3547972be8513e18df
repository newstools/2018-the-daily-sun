And love has no colour,” he said. “It transcends all barriers and comes naturally.“Let’s declare war on racism. Mzansi must rise beyond divisions and factionalism. Through unity we’ll live in harmony.”Mzwakhe said his new album commemorates Nelson Mandela’s 100th birthday.“We celebrate his centenary with song,” he said. “The album speaks of nation- building and addresses drugs, racism, violence, xenophobia and gives praise to women.”Mzwakhe’s life as a poet dates back to 1979 as a member of the Khuvhungano cultural group. He was King Cetshwayo in the play Victory of Isandlwana. His poetry took off when he replaced one of the group’s two poets, who skipped the country and went into exile.“It was during a night vigil when I asked comrades to harmonise the song,” he said. “I recited the poem, and the following day the pastor who was conducting the funeral at the Regina Mundi Catholic Church in Soweto heard about what I did the previous night and asked me to repeat the poem. “I was then inundated with invitations to recite poems.”His longest poem Stalwart depicts the role played by political leaders.Mzwakhe, who loves reading, said: “When you eat, food goes to the stomach and reading goes to the brain.”He was detained several times in 1987 and 1988, and after the release of Change is Pain and Unbroken Spirit. He wrote the book Voice of Reason, and his biography will be out this year.Mzwakhe hates music piracy.
