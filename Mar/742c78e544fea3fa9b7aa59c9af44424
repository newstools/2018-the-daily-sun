Another resident said they had an electricity problem which caused trips all the time time. “We suspect that the fire could have been an electrical fault. Eskom needs to come and fix this or incidents like this will continue to happen,” said another resident. Residents said the kids’ 53-year-old grandmother tried to open the door with the help of neighbours. “She managed to escape, but the kids could not make it. She was rushed to hospital because she was badly burned,” said a resident. Western Cape police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said an inquest case had been opened. “The cause of the fire is yet to be established,” she said.
