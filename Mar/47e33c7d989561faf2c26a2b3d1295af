It's thanks to the Economic Freedom Fighters' protest that
international clothing retailer H&M has promised an overhaul of its
marketing divisions, Ahmed Kathrada Foundation director Neeshan Balton said. "We don't claim credit for H&M moving to the point
that they want to engage and change. It's the general outrage from across the
globe, it's the actions of the EFF and it's the actions from ourselves and
other anti-racism foundations."After a large group of EFF supporters stormed H&M stores
across the country, Balton said the Swedish company met with the Institute for
Justice and Reconciliation as well as the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation on several
occasions in an effort to understand where it can improve.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv39lUJaajPgRqS7p6EcOtiTha6wrIhlHh7AHOoEaihdwPdHj97aZHp_EqY1imGX1db3th6ok8ucfpmAcNhfb6mRkNSfNnbof4A3fUHyvsWD-t82jLQr8Du_ceA_MEur7Pd0FtFIKGkFWop70uEPAfFv0j7ChTNAtTKdwBoBx_bzo8J1fYfDM3Zg5zSROA-SBvvXj2q1GtvYA_vUohWCJPnpNHfyz6ZeBLpCoGnUGQCXiHiXu4p3VvU3lwKBeEFvNwHDuSSKwPMhZneJoCru4ngDKIz4_c\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMQg1qIJLbtoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

talk to a good few thousand of their staff and in June, we would be addressing
their board of directors and that would complete the chain and communication."Hopefully they will also now be engaging with
anti-racism organisations in Europe and across America to have similar kinds of
discussions."Balton added that the foundation was happy that H&M was
willing to look at policies and systems.South African H&M branches were forced to close when EFF
supporters stormed and trashed stores in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town
in January.They were protesting against an advert that showed a black
child in a sweatshirt, with the words "coolest monkey in the jungle"
printed on it. Police used rubber bullets to disperse the protesters.The EFF's actions propelled H&M to act more decisively
on its role in the matter, Balton said. "The EFF helped immensely. Before the protest by the
EFF, we already wrote to the company and received a response. The response was
bland, it had no substance to it."Balton added that the foundation had intended to have its
own protest."We didn't plan it on the scale that the EFF did and we
didn't plan [on] going into the stores and ripping down railings. I don't think
the EFF had planned that themselves. I think they had similar intentions of
demonstrating outside the stores... That got huge global coverage and because
it's a global chain store, they had to respond."SOURCE: NEWS24
