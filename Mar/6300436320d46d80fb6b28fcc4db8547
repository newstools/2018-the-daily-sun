The outbreak of listeriosis has been traced to an Enterprise Foods facility in Polokwane, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced on Sunday. "We can now conclude scientifically that the source of the present outbreak is the Enterprise Food production facility located in Polokwane," he said at the offices of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg.Listeria has been traced to another Enterprise facility in Germiston on the East Rand, and a Rainbow chicken facility in the Free State, but further tests were needed as the sequence type was not yet known.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstuYxWxDdWvOR3ctuBjap4pEy-3fv4A2i4x5hWVhH39V4pSWTTYWNegSyFTfrKQ1c8l9xR01z_teDCYB6BAiuXxyXVZViq52xozGnf3zSFz7cFPOCP0Ar6sxp1AfKnR-ckPl-SQqqdEW3F_dj1ou3klF5kFTC7TtiQ8oiLMe1hSRmhu9a1P43JKtXGZPAulepbwQotS6O-rHkA5ne2L-9igAzNukM0RkD946QTjwm7slZs-0NLCpEJj8i4BbUcuzTctYM21xUxmiIgr62BMbH0L2JSAeFA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFZvteYyxvZrEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Tests were done, and it was found that they had listeriosis.The strain they were affected with, which was the same for the larger outbreak, was traced to Enterprise's Polokwane facility. Listeria is a bacterium that is naturally found in the environment - it commonly occurs in soil, water, vegetation and in the faeces of some animals. It can contaminate a wide variety of food types, including meat and meat products, dairy products (unpasteurised and pasteurised), fresh and frozen produce (fruits, vegetables and sprouts) and ready-to-eat products.SOURCE: News24
