Casac has filed an application to interdict NPA boss Shaun
Abrahams from announcing whether former president Jacob Zuma will be
prosecuted, pending a Constitutional Court ruling on an appeal in the
case.Â  The possible charges against Zuma include fraud, corruption
and racketeering.In its papers filed with the ConCourt, the Council for the
Advancement of the SA Constitution's executive secretary, Parmananda Naidoo,
argues that, if Abrahams takes a decision on the prosecution of Zuma,
"there will be reasonable perception that his decision was biased". if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvyZSqCdSTrsTGZ4vVzoOuJo3kX8S-2GVeflxhFAK2lMrWWI-xDb2VVjRte9xjViy56EyQv8xOCzcuZIvK1-ZUb6FmiLUAFEEoYtvRKZMTTN0Dmsuuy-E2AW-UUKa9mvsoFgJiGjmhVbRUNYMiNJG3jtTEqCdj3w0Ur1B-p0Pk93McNwcaF49t-EN30i-DmDvaKFmfV3waNqJFVLpYTqnHDK_4uUZt5GvADCdUwaJja9rCEZTchIJ6if0g0lebJaZnfeYpcJjmHblCoYXu2QBAPlZQLbsw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEw4rmc_HkZoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

the announcement, and he had refused. "He has only given an undertaking that he will afford
Casac two weeks notice before he announces a decision." Abrahams gave Casac notice on February 26 - two days before
the ConCourt heard the matter. "Mr Abrahams has informed the applicants that his
undertaking not to take a decision expires on 15 March 2018."Accordingly, this application is brought urgently and
Casac asks that this court deals with it before 15 March 2018." On December 15, North Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo
ruled that Abrahams' appointment was questionable. The court gave then-deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa two
months to appoint a new head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) after
it declared the post vacant.Zuma and the NPA appealed the ruling. However, following his
election as president of the country, Ramaphosa withdrew the president's
appeal. The matter was heard in the Constitutional Court on February
28. Judgment was reserved.SOURCE: NEWS24
