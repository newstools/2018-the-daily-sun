for 8 March.“The disciplinary process to hold Maritz to account for any
proven wrongdoing can no longer be pursued in light of clear legal precedent
that a resignation by an employee unilaterally terminates the employment
relationship. Eskom has, as a result, accepted Maritz’s resignation with
immediate effect,” Eskom said.The utility said the Board of Eskom remains committed to its
mandate to root out maladministration.Eskom further mentioned that rooting out maladministration
is critical to the foundation of restoring transparent and effective
governance.
