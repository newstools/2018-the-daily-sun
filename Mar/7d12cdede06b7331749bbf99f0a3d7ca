We would arrive at different houses, praying for people in their yards who would then offer us accommodation.“She goes to people’s properties and tells them they are doomed and need cleansing. “Since last year, we have moved to six properties. None of us has seen her home.”Jabusile said she managed to escape when they were living in Dobsonville extension 3. On Saturday, she borrowed someone’s phone and asked her aunt, Zandile Radebe (46), to fetch her at Bara taxi rank. Her family was over the moon because they thought Jabusile was dead. “We opened a missing persons case at Dawn Park Police Station. We are so happy. “God is great,” said Zandile.Constable Nkemeleng Mabula said: “The station is aware of the missing persons report and we can confirm she came back to her family. Because the family brought her to the station and explained issues of tradition, we could not link it to any criminal case at this stage. “If they want to press charges, they can come to the station and see the station or branch commander to make the correct charge in terms of the crime.”
