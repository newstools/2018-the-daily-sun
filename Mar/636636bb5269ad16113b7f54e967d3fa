But first, they have to get maximum points this weekend when they face play-offs hopefuls Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila at Giyani Stadium on Saturday (3pm.) A draw in their game against AmaTuks next weekend would then guarantee them a spot in the Premiership next season. Despite the odds favouring them Da Gama says they will remain humble till the last game of the season.He said: “There are still six games to play, which is another 18 points. We hope to do well in all of them. “It is very difficult to be in our position, every team wants to beat us and will up their game. “We need to remain humble and continue with the hard work.On facing Tshakhuma, who have done well in their first season, the former Platinum Stars mentor said: “They are not a easy side, they have proved that. They have lost only once at home.“The fact that they are playing for a spot in the play-offs will make things even tougher.”Tshakhuma are fifth in the table with 36 points from 24 matches.The Lions of the North, who were relegated from the top flight last season, will want to reach the milestone of playing 20 games without defeat. This would see them break Thanda Royal Zulu’s record of 19 games unbeaten, set last season. Da Gama added: “Records were made to be broken but our focus is not on that. We are focusing on our game, not chasing any records.”
