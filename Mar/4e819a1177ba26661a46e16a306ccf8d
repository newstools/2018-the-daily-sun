She joined the university in 2016 and took over as deputy vice-chancellor of research last year. Phakeng acknowledged the task ahead of her “I know the task that lies ahead is a mammoth one and I don’t underestimate its complexities. But in every challenge we face there are also opportunities,” she said. “I also know that alongside all the members of the campus community, we will meet the challenges and reach even higher milestones.” Student Nomusa Dube said it was an opportunity for women to prove they could rise above any circumstance.
