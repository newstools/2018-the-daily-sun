I will take legal action, where the truth will come out. I cannot say if what they did to me is fair or not, because I would need to explain myself, which is something that I don’t want to do now. They have made their decision and I’m challenging it.”This is not something new in the Baroka team. Last season at the same time of the year the club suspended Jacob Sakala and later fired him and his assistant Edward Williams, as well as technical director Mark Harrison.Added Thobejane: “In life such things do happen, and when they happen you need to remain positive and do the right thing. I will only say ‘they have defeated me’ when I lose the case.”Thobejane also revealed that he had spoken with the two players involved, Masuluke and Shaku. “The two boys will have to be strong. They have been part of this team since our ABC Motsepe League days – Shaku was there in 2011 when they made history in the Nedbank Cup.”The sacking of Thobejane means MacDonald Makhubedu will be in charge till the end of the season.Like this story?
