Being able to step out of myself and become her keeps me sane. She saves me in more way than I can count,” she said.Jessica also thanked God for blessing her with the gift of acting.“I think God did it on purpose to make me the type of person that I am and then make sure that I’m in the field that I’m in. God is a genius I tell you and he amazes me every day. I’m in awe,” she continued.Jessica has been through a rough patch over the last couple of months.Towards the end of 2017, Jessica and her former friend, Phindile Gwala were at the center of a scandal when a video of the two of them having lunch with a notorious businessman went viral.The video showed the two girls in front of a large bowl of money.In another video that went viral, the same businessman and his friends can be seen showing off a suitcase full of money and saying that it is for the “girls”.News24 reported that the video that Jessica and Phindile appeared in had become the subject of a police investigation.Jessica’s PR team told the media at the time that she was just an "innocent bystander" who was "simply meeting a friend for lunch”.Jessica and Phindile have since allegedly ended their friendship.This woman right here (Qondi Ngubane).... *sigh* Going to set and being this girl seriously saves me. Being able to step out of myself and become her keeps me sane. She saves me in more way than I can count. I thank God for the therapeutic part of art and acting. Being me can get tiring, frustrating and unbearable but thank God that I am able to literally step out of my life and become a totally different person, and focus on her and her problems for a while. I don’t know if I’m making sense or if anyone understands but... ya... ????‍???? - -I think God did it on purpose to make me the type of person that I am and then make sure that I’m in the field that I’m in. God is a genius I tell you and he amazes me everyday... I’m in awe... ???????????? He makes everything to work for my good, All The Time!!! #ActingSavesLives ?? #IAmAnActress #ILoveActing #QueenQondi #MissJessicaNkosiA post shared by  jessicankosi (@jessicankosi) on Mar 13, 2018 at 9:33pm PDT
