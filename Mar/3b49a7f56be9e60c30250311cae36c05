We do not even have electricity and water.“Our councillor is neglecting us,” the protester said. Ekurhuleni municipal spokesman Zweli Dlamini said squatters started protesting on Monday.“Their main concern was the issue of electricity.“The member of the mayoral committee for human settlements, Lesibya Mpya, has assured the community their area is in the plans for electrification.”Dlamini said they would go to the area before the end of the month to establish how many shacks were there before electricity could be installed.
