But the dual bantamweight champion is not keen to lock horns with hard-punching South African fighter.“Tete wants to unify the division, so we’re not prepared to give up that dream and our target man is Burnett.“Our promotional team is doing everything to make that fight happen, including defending on Burnett’s backyard. We want to send a message that we can fight him anywhere, there must be one king on bantamweight division,” said Theng’imfene.It’s understood Tete’s Promoter Frank Warren from Britain took the fight to Belfast to lure Burnett to come on board.Said Warren: “We’re back to Belfast as we want to make the Ryan unification fight. If Tete dominates shows in Burnett’s hometown it’ll lure him out of hiding. Let’s give the fans the fight that they want to see. We want to make that fight in Belfast and I’m sure it would pack out the SSE Arena.”Like this story?
