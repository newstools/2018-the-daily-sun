I encourage you to support the local economy by buying from local shops.“Local businesses suffer because people no longer buy from local spaza shops and general dealers.“These days we prefer to buy at malls, while the local economy continues to struggle,” he said.“Local development forums should not stop the development process, but should support it. Local communities should be given first preference. Leaders should also create opportunities for locals,” he said.“I’d like to congratulate the leadership of the TJ Gumede ANC Youth League branch for organising this event because it’s important in preparing for elections and reminding people to register this weekend.“Those who have registered should go and check if their names still appear on the voters’ roll and update their information,” he told the People’s Paper.The event ended with music by local artist the likes of Pastor Darling, Fistos Da DJ, Just KB, Skinny Dancers, Matlhodi, Candy, Belex, Solly Boys, Moloi, Njabulo, Tshepo Prince, among others.
