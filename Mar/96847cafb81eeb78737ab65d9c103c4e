We want them to commit to a deadline.” Education spokesman Keith Khoza saidthe department had planned to build 345 houses this year and next year, and more houses thereafter.“A developer has been identified and we’re in the process of finalising contractual matters,” said Khoza. “The work will commence after the contract has been signed.”
