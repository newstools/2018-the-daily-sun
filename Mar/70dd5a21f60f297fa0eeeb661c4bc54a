MEC Panyaza Lesufi said: "These allegations are shocking and disturbing. A person entrusted with protecting children has violated their trust and that of their parents. This man should meet the full might of the law.”Lesufi said it is unfortunate and regrettable that this incident occurred to the very same learners who were previous victims of the school patroller.
