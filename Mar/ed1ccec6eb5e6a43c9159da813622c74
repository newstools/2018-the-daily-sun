I had a meeting with SAFA and it has led to this scenario. There is an agreement that has been signed by both parties."I have no beef with any South African. I don't want there to be fighting in any associations. I don't want to talk about the elections, my job here was to resolve any fights, that's my mandate."The former Premier Soccer League (PSL) referee and general manager received a single vote against Jordaan's 52 votes during the presidency nominations.Ncobo requested FIFA to put SAFA under administration for the code of conduct the association has breached over the years. On Wednesday he also posted a picture as evidence of an impending interdict that he was planning to serve SAFA.
