DOZENS of US couples donned crowns and cradled guns at a ceremony in a Pennsylvania church on Wednesday, forcing a nearby school to close and angering protesters.The event, in which couples commit to each other, was organised by Hyung Jin Moon, younger son of the late Sun Myung Moon, whose World Peace and Unification Sanctuary is a tiny spin-off of the Unification Church. The church was founded by his father, a self-declared “messiah” considered a charlatan by critics. He praises a religion of weapons and prayer.“In essence, you know, we believe in a peace police in a peace militia,” said Kyle Toffey, a helper at the ceremony. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuZz3hASlTfTB6yw7Z4kUO2H4ewa7mqpez6MKt80ykzWfLwuOceyUj30-4ETb2K4BF4NMXtkpXIU4pvjFaCIrb1SDay5__0jyipVLn-_WVnk9DixkNrDgJ1WL8plb4jUtMqm3X0ZYqbgPoGJBaDnCB5HsAa6Cjt7_DsRT82XavTuOvYQM4SdmU7IlpWfZPdUVprYILOENlJo0YJN9uxjy_Qj2fWqYATjXFK2Pj70NCB35GWvMiGIECqWX62Ni1dJHDYy7S8nALDlaDz5E8ULjuD8auCNC8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLXoNfES-toQEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
