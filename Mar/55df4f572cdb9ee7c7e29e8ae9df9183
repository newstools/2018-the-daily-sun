This is the work of umthakathi (a witch)." She said.The Generations The Legacy star had put her practice on hold last year for safetyn reasons and now she has announced that she is back."So apparently I've quit my work as a traditional healer? Yes. I did put practicing on hold for a brief while, while moving my practice.
