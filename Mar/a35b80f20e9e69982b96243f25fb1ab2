The sad man said women didn’t stay in his life for long. “I’ve tried dating but all those women wanted my money and not my heart,” he said. “I’m ready for a new relationship. I have a lot of love to give the right woman.” Eric said he was confident there was someone waiting for him out there. He contacted Daily Sun to help him. “I know the People’s Paper will help me find my future wife,” he said. However, Eric has specific preferences. “My wife can’t be skinny. She has to be a full-figured African woman. She must be ready to love me as much as I love her,” he said. Eric said his life would be complete with a big woman to share it.
