IF the recent Solidarity survey is anything to go by, some street beggars make more money than company workers. According to Marlien van der Westhuizen of Solidarity Helping Hand, a study was carried out in November to investigate addicts and how they afford drugs. Fifty drug addicts aged 18–48 were interviewed.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsthlR55XC-pltzEKR0NjIQwoITHJXpzJQZuRvjDwaZF03VbdxgNbtGLzwCxQ-nE7_bMFN0-NdF_C5F_nOlo392O8BrXak-8cnXedBSH2Xl5HneGu8gtD7Ywoba6uOoQm8kvjcm5Q0UBDmNH7Ui6-nDZE8iEpu-h4DNh3NdVJBqJEZl-Fj3vKBmMvgwzOrIA636gP150okS88qal4NoVG792MbcQ2qJHLr7oyqqO0iGIyazceQ36Wnf0BI3vIM1gvgsIH2kjDfmS6BSI-TVXV8VKD6N-tdU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzISbd58TGhm6EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

A beggar who calls himself AKA (30) said he left home in the Eastern Cape three years ago to look for a job.When he couldn’t find a job, he decided to beg. He said: “I have a shack and every morning I go begging on the streets. “On a bad day, I make R200 and on a good day I make R500. I’m no longer looking for a job.”Another beggar who only gave his name as Sifiso (28) said: “When I started begging, I was only 22. I used to make a lot of money, at least R700 a day. “These days, people prefer to only give us food which makes it difficult for me to maintain my drug addiction.”Beggar and recycler Simphiwe Ndlovu said he needed help to stop taking drugs.“I spend R50 every day just on drugs,” said Simphiwe.
