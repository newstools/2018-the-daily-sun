MOST right-minded people condemn people’s justice.
It prevents victims of crime from seeing proper justice carried out in court and also, those who are attacked could be innocent!This was the case with 28-year-old Shalom Malesa, identified as an armed robbery suspect because of his dreadlocks. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuDBlPGu4wjcSouTiigPTf4f8q2xIGfsd7FFpFN57WuSyMuMvdiGyigSPfv-bN1hWdpkWbKxBMgC6tW9Q2G8QjzKnI-QC0cd24HmSviYkLP4Dhh8AlrvCH-bYgclE6kb95YbgKcO7sZk6oJ-5iFOcx95O41rQeE1la4b_GJFJQdFsYFURmIoQ9o4iU_5U80Ux4MIK6i8RKxWCLA5-34e92VT8KRJgLi3leHXVLUafKNCwvNZxNtc22w4-lfNNWMwu_bNjJSHqrytLYktJeYQucTR2jVoAw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAoGhZYNbZNpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He had several head injuries.His mum, Josephine Malesa (47) said she was shocked when she got a call to say her son was assaulted by residents accusing him of being a thug.Shalom said he wants to lay charges as he recognised several of those who assaulted him. He also fears being attacked again.
