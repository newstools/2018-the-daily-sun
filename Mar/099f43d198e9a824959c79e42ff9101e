to News24, zama zamas have been operating at the mine, which is situated near
Modderbee prison, for two months.That all
came to a halt when security guards busted and confronted them.When the
other miners heard gunshots, they reportedly ran to safety.The
zama-zama, More Ngondi, reportedly took out a knife and that was
when he was shot dead.One of the
accused was granted bail and is expected to reappear on 27 March.The other
seven suspects remain in custody.
