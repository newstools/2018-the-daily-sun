THIS mysterious man walked into the pub in Makapanstad, North West, four months ago and has been a regular feature ever since.For some strange reason, he stayed behind after all the boozers had left. And that’s not because he’s a moreki who comes there every day to quench his thirst. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssl2XpXyLAaxqoBlXsd0Dn2Y9tE2tpmfQ0WxEgOWvuxLXm6VDCVRjGsSSorgNEs-mi97fJHgK86m1QDpCfmXbbDIcMO6aLN_Ris2MwluP82zwx32i0mJoZ5Wm9N2y9tFfQn9aKGNr9DFLiFp7Ws6eY3nib64-VrsZpIgt6eQQYzCJYweWRvjaUWY8Qr3lluL-DV8io4Sxso_jsrxSsJ6LMCH8XM6pCUw70Fg-ZD0N6UD46sdbQy1mNrYGGVGbEV06_X6-vjDRrq-xuC7uyYJ7jRuz_otog\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFfoIAuoxUm9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He won’t know where to find his family should anything happen to him.“The man says he’s from Durban, sometimes he mentions Cape Town, and other times Limpopo.“Cops don’t know where to start. He doesn’t understand anything.” Anyone with information should call the Daily Sun office on 011 877 6060.
