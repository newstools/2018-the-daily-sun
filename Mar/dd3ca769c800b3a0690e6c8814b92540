Skolopad, who is known for her sexy dance moves and skimpy outfits, said she already had a collection of gospel songs and her daughter would play the keyboard for her.When asked whether she would continue wearing provocative clothing, she said she would be professional while performing gospel.“Gospel artists are usually invited to sing in churches so if that happens, I won’t go to church in revealing clothes.”Pastor Ncebo Mazibuko, of the Faith in Christ Bible Church, said in the Bible, Saul used to hunt Christians to kill them before he changed his name and began preaching the word of God.
