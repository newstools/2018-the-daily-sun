You might remember the stories about ‘Plan B’. But when this trophy arrived at Lanseria airport in 2010 it removed the last doubts on whether or not we would host. It was the end of doubt and beginning of the World Cup in SA.”Jordaan admitted it was a sad indictment that Bafana were not going to the World Cup but remains optimistic of the future tournaments.He said: “The 2026 World Cup will have 10 teams from Africa. It is for us, the federations, to establish ourselves. Some 179 nations did not qualify for this coming World Cup. Among them are Italy, Netherlands, Ghana, Algeria, SA, USA and Chile. “What we have to do now is not to look at the opportunity missed, but to grab the next opportunity. We have already invested a lot towards this goal. Stuart Baxter has a plan called the radical transformation of Bafana Bafana and he will announce it next week.”Like this story?
