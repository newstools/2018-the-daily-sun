IF THERE is one Soweto derby that seems certain to produce a winner, it must be tomorrow’s highly anticipated Absa Premiership showdown between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates.Over 50 000 vociferous supporters are expected to pack FNB Stadium before the 3.30pm kick-off in the hope of witnessing their side score enough goals to produce a winner at the end of the 90-plus minutes.Their last three meetings since 2016 ended in draws, which has been an irritation to Bucs and Amakhosi supporters.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsugpzgaSIJ9nhzChRNWCItYvLxqBXrqcSEgd72qEvDvW8gA1eSHpG_287kMcWEJjSHF5pyIKzxrrvEK-pVP3uUZhL5uh4yukdgL2tIol_T2Um66SC0YtXRw9K8QPcetY5CAoq8ExT7sZuaPUUFzgP1Mp29v6QScyt_ZiORTOeNKZvc1-cZDtMiBpODyHPTVy8Z_tPl4nFsYqf11NlA3ew2fRKd2kYHCOf8yVkcH0kswPBXsG6EOuFpip60eIwZ7b_tVA7YfXWyQ9H62ipRWL5Hn7g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHTBYnEUXaMUEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Victory for Chiefs could lift them to second in the table with 38.) ORLANDO PIRATES COACH MICHO SREDOJEVIC: When the Serbian returned to Mzansi after a successful stint in Uganda, he expressed his desire to win the league. And he is on course to do that, with Rhulani Mokwena at his side. A win for Bucs tomorrow would ensure they retain second position. The 48-year-old arrived just as Bucs fans had all but given up on their club. But look at them today.Mused Komphela midweek: “The stakes are high, not only because it is a derby. “One is tempted to ask ‘could it be that whoever wins on Saturday will challenge for the championship?’ Possibly, yes!”And the forever smiling Sredojevic agreed, saying the derby could go some way towards defining the season for his team. He will look to players like Justin Shonga to give Chiefs goalie Itumeleng Khune a torrid time. But Komphela has Ryan Moon to brag about and is sure to throw him into battle against Bucs goalie Jackson Mabokgwane.Like this story?
