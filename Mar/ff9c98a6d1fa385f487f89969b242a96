The station and KZN have embraced us wholly and we’ve enjoyed every minute of connecting with our new listeners.  Thank You to everyone who has tuned into The Kings Drive and supported us on this new journey as well as the relentless work ethic of the comprehensive on and off-air team,” said The Kings Of The Weekend, Sphectacula and Naves.It seems like the boys are in a pretty good season right now with the success of their radio being only one of a few achievements this year.The Kings of The Weekend’s single, Ngisho  has been doing very well and receiving major airplay.The boys are also allegedly set to release new music later this month and are in pre-production for season 5 of their DJ talent search TV show, 1s and 2s.Catch The King Drive Mondays-Fridays from 3-6pm on Gagasi 99.5 FM.
