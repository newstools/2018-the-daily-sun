MEMBERS of the Football Transformation Forum (FTF) say they have noted with great concern the “concerted efforts of certain parties to tarnish the image of Safa president Danny Jordaan” and the association he leadsJordaan has come under fire from former PSL referee Ace Ncobo, who has accused him of, among other things, gross violation of the Safa constitution and Fifa statutes.Ncobo has since called on Jordaan to step down from his position, in light of the rape case opened against him by musician and former ANC MP Jennifer Ferguson.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstXmyrzS7AT8O_2_Eu8xbyPGdRF5ajjfkyEETrfJFmfbo-G_2OiXcv8injeHGi0iFIUESmGOWq0mNaYFbWUZjUceJAGO-v9OyM_vdVXTt3P7PXobUjY4DD_qFD9u8moC3Khebqr70X3QVvVKE5YknYkEdkhw7lNwQN7GIDvPBFmVOgWpGvYaNU-Zo8NP4YDB9sPsnhiPfpcYgRwpanaUmRX3cNu9Qwge6_zv_6qmre2AMxaL12xulUJs3mzSUuRIL_cp4h91Qr9WyuFLDlW\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCg8u8neXrlGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But it is concerning when they go to the extent of damaging an individual’s image,” said FTF secretary-general and Safa national executive committee member Mzwandile Maforvane. “There have been issues leading up to elections in the past. But this is dirtier. It is character assassination. “People in football will know this all too well. You’ll remember the issue of the dossier which was dropped off at Sascoc House prior to the 2013 elections. And then there were the 2010 World Cup bribery stories and the rape allegations before the extraordinary congress last year.”Maforvane also laid into expelled Safa vice-president Mwelo Nonkonyana, who has been fighting Safa in court. Nonkonyana submitted an interdict to the High Court to force Safa to conclude the case that had led to his suspension and later his expulsion as one of three Safa deputy presidents.And despite the court ruling in Safa’s favour Nonkonyana, who is also one of Jordaan’s critics, has vowed to fight to be reinstated. “This is the eighth case he has lost. If he was paying out of his own pocket, he would not be taking the matter back to the courts each time he loses a case,” Maforvane added.“He owes Safa millions from these cases. He has been ordered to pay the costs.”
