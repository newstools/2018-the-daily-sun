Barrett said such shocking videos show how eyewitness accounts can expose violence and help police to identify culprits. He warned witnesses never to put their lives at risk. “If a person is caught in a heist, they should get to a place of safety as quickly as possible,” he said. He said witnesses should call cops on 10111 as soon as they can. “What are the perpetrators wearing? What colour and make is the car? Can you see the number plate?” He said people should look out for signs of shock like sweaty skin, anxiety and shallow breathing. “Get counselling if you have to.”
