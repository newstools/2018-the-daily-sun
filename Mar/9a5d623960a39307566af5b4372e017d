The team will place a permanent memorial artwork on the lake island at Toxteth Park and launch it in June.It will be known as Mandela Island and the bridge linking the island with the park will be called Freedom Bridge. Avatriou Events will bring the #Liverpool4Madiba Experience with former players Robbie Fowler, John Barnes and Steve McManaman.The three will host a dinner in Joburg with part of the proceeds from the dinner going towards several charitable causes, including The House Group, which supports young girls who are survivors of human trafficking. The visit will have a three-day tour of Mzansi. This will include a media conference, a gala dinner with fans and a coaching clinic with 250 underprivileged children to be hosted at the Metro Stars Football Development Centre in Benoni, Ekurhuleni. There is a once in a lifetime opportunity to meet the Liverpool legends with limited tickets on sale. They are going fast. The gala dinner will take place on on Heritage Day at the Hilton Hotel in Sandton, Joburg.
