If we don’t, we can’t hear each other.” Mazwi said he was worried about the future of his kids because they’ve been struggling to do their homework because of the noise.His daughter, Athenkosi Godlo (26), said she has battled to study for almost a year. “At night we can’t sleep and we have to wake up early in the morning.”SK Diesels manager Monica Brown told Daily Sun they have many generators around Butterworth. “We only supply the generator but it’s by request of MTN,” she said.According to Brown, MTN contracted Ericsson to look after the network poles. Ericsson official Joshua Kock said they would investigate.
