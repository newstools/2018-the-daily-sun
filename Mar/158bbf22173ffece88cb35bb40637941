especially among millennial women.Business Insider reports that Toys R Us was one of the
last national toy chains, and more retailers could be in trouble.In the company's most recent annual filing it said: "Most
of our end-customers are newborns and children and, as a result, our revenues
are dependent on the birth rates in countries where we operate. "In recent
years, many countries' birth rates have dropped or stagnated as their
population ages, and education and income levels increase. A continued and
significant decline in the number of newborns and children in these countries
could have a material adverse effect on our operating results."However, the country's declining birth rate is not the
sole reason for Toys R Us' bankruptcy. The company also said growing
competition from online retailers, some $4.8 billion worth of debt, the rising
popularity of online games, and an increase in labor costs as factors that may
damage its business.
