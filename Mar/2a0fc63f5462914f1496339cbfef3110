We perform at malls all over Mzansi for cash, but we set aside some of our income for charity.“We distribute clothes and cash to old age homes and orphanages.”This Saturday at 9am, the group from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, and Alex will visit an old age home in Polokwane and donate goods and money to the elderly living there.“Thereafter, we’ll dance at a nearby shopping centre and entertain crowds with our sePedi music and moves,” said Robert.When they are not dancing at malls, the men of Banna are booked for weddings, parties, tombstone unveilings and other celebrations.Robert said they charge a basic fee of R2 500 for a show, and the amount excludes transport costs, which vary from one area to the next.
