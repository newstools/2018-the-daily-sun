eroded the capital base and this continues to impact on the entity’s ability to
operate in a highly demanding and competitive environment,” he said.“The history of losses, lack of capital and volatility in
foreign exchange rates, along with maturing loans and working capital
deficiencies, indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast
significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”SAA has not yet tabled its financial report to Parliament
and has been given an extension until the end of April to do so.The airline also delayed the submission of its financial
statements to the AG, and only did so on October 31, 2017, Makwetu said in the
report.This delayed the auditing process and the audit report. The
AG eventually issued the report to SAA’s accounting authority on December 8
2017.The DA plans to write to Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene
requesting him to release SAA’s financial report as a matter of urgency, MP Alf
Lees said in a statement issued on Thursday.“It is odd that the Auditor General has chosen to table the
audit reports in Parliament, which is a complete departure from standard
practice where audit reports are released as part of annual reports,” he said.The AG’s report gives reasons for the qualified opinion.
Among these being that SAA failed to maintain complete records of irregular
expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure. The same is true for Mango.The AG also raised issued with SAA's records of  property, aircraft and equipment and inventory.SAA is yet to respond to Fin24's queries.SOURCE: NEWS24
