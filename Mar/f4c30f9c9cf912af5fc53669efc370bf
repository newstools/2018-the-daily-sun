Steve Komphela has been in the news since he joined Kaiser Chiefs as a coach, mostly for all the wrong reasons.Steve has not had an impressive run at the club and what made him famous is his post match interviews which often leave people confused.Last week, the Amakhosi coach was ridiculed for the shirt he was wearing when his team played and lost against Orlando Pirates. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvSBsvTDqyS0TgaiFy0STRlHaKjBLDE5G--hzBbHoKDZrkoMv1Q2jcvWLW0Cp5rbe1NdpQjbtNBOHVI5b5ui5iNqCuZPuRdA76L7GLw9ebLoFC9li9Gix-B_6qeaq4ag8ypiS8wDFu71pE4u5htA5c2W3c-ly4Mtes2L4W1WmRCfwgYuxOBflyXneXsnbL9UoeEouCsLlB36fUfVTQ-OAvmDokpzlj9CAsBDyE-cxa32CgWfyLZHO3_MooKOrTTOUMuQAKUFnajvvhb8lrywcFUk5wHOAw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHr1LC23hXC4EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
