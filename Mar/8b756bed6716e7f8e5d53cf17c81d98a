We need to do the job for ourselves and not rely on other teams. It’s going to be hard but it has to be done.”He said drawing away at Kaizer Chiefs in their last Absa Premiership match on Saturday had given them the courage and hope they lacked before. “Strange things have happened this season. You win two or more matches in a row and you’re out of the relegation zone into top eight,” he said. “We need to pull up our socks and win matches. Who knows, maybe we might find ourselves in the top eight.”Usuthu face Ajax on 3 April, Bloemfontein Celtic away five days later, Orlando Pirates at home on 15 April, Dikwena away on 25 April, Bidvest Wits away on 28 April and Cape Town City at home on 12 May.
