They are not driving."If you look at the Under-21 league in England, they are travelling from all over the place in the country."We have equalled that standard in the PSL to motivate the players."The Cup competition consists of all the 16 PSL clubs, they will be split into four regions West Coast (Ajax Cape Town, Cape Town City, Bloemfontein Celtic Free State Stars) Central (Kaizer Chiefs,Platinum Stars, Orlando Pirates, Bidvest Wits), North (SuperSport United, Mamelodi Sundowns, Baroka FC, Polokwane City) and East Coast (Maritzburg United, Chippa United, AmaZulum, and the MDC reighning champions Golden Arrows).The winners of each group advance to the semi finals where each and every corner of mzansi will be represented. The winners will get R150 000 towards a football department initiative in their community.Like this story?
