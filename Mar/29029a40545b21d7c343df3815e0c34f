Two pistols and an AK47 were recovered from the abandoned car. The driver of an Isuzu was also shot during the hijacking. Makhubele said one of the constables was out of hospital and the other was expected to be discharged soon. “The police are investigating three cases of attempted murder and one of hijacking,” said the police spokesman.
