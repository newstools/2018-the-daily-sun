Two pistols and an AK47 were recovered from the abandoned car. The driver of an Isuzu was also shot during the hijacking. Makhubele said one of the constables was out of hospital and the other was expected to be discharged soon. “The police are investigating three cases of attempted murder and one of hijacking,” said the police spokesman. Makhubele encouraged members of the public to come forward with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects. However, he warned against approaching the suspects because they are considered armed and dangerous. ) In February a traffic officer was shot in the head while on duty. According to a statement released by City of Joburg officials, the 47-year-old officer was wounded when he tried to stop a man from hijacking a taxi in Booysens‚ south of Joburg. Sadly the cop eventually died as a result of his injuries.
