Farmer Mujaji Maluleke (55) said she has lost more than 10 goats since the problem started in September last year. “Five of my goats were stolen a week ago. Initially when my goats didn’t return to the kraal, I thought dogs had killed them. “But then as more and more goats went missing, I realised something was wrong,” she said.Mujaji said they heard rumours that people were stealing goats and selling them in Malamulele.Limpopo police spokesman Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that two suspects were arrested.“The suspects will appear in the Saselamani Regional Court soon,” he said.
