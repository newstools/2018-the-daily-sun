He said iAt first it was hard to do things by himself, so his parents tried to buy him mechanical fingers.“I refused because I wanted to be independent,” said Morena. He realised this while trying to dry his towel at the age of nine. His left hand wouldn’t turn while the other could. “So my pinky finger on the left hand side helps the pointer one on the right hand side.” He Morenasaid living with disability has taught him to realise the power of the mind.  “The way you think will determine how you cope with two fingers or any disability,” he said. He’s grateful to his late mum Victoria. He said: “She boosted my confidence and would dress me in vests and sleeveless tops.”She wanted people to get used to him. “She used to tell me that if the community is aware of your disability, they won’t be afraid of you.” Perhaps that’s why, at the tender age of nine, Morena was already a DJ, dancer and singer. “When I grew older I became a designer, motivational speaker, soccer player and actor,” he said.Morena is now a full-time drama and dance teacher at Roto Entertainment School.Morena said hHis movie Abafana Abathathu is playing on Mzansi Magic bBioskop.He also hosts the Disability Experience on Kasi FM every Tuesday.
