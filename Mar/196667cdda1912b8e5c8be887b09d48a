that he wasn’t the biological father of their kids and that she had to have
affairs because he was impotent.On that fateful day, Chika had been in her medicine shop
at about 8.45pm and had left her four kids at home with Nnadiogo. According to an unnamed source: “On Saturday, as the wife
left their house for her medicine store in the evening, with their four
children left behind, her husband called the children one after the other. He
observed their face closely and thereafter began to stab them with a knife.”The children were aged between two and 10.He then chased the domestic worker around the house
before killing her.“He hid himself in one of the rooms in the four-storeyed
building where they lived and took his own life by taking poison.“Before he killed himself, he said ‘Let Chika now go and
stay with the biological father of her children,’” the source added.The Anambra State cop spokeswoman, Nkeiruka Nwode, is
quoted in the report as saying: “I was at the scene of the incident yesterday and
today. For now, I can’t give a comprehensive report of what happened. Whatever happened
is inexplicable. It is better we wait for the medical reports to provide
additional details. It was said that the man just left a psychiatric hospital
in Arochukwu, Abia State.”
