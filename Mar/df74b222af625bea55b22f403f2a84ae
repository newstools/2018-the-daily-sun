NORMALLY there are procedures to be followed when hiring someone, but this doesn’t always happen with domestic workers. According to the Brixton Police Station in Joburg, employers must do a background check. Brixton station spokeswoman Jeanette Backhoff said they had noticed a trend where domestic workers were involved in housebreakings. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsubjk_WPXC3d8Msr039yHMn4gANyZTP1fv8ev7NNf1m4Mnc1t4Tc9EcG3f4CVFuTcJI2L0RlsRrKZCbTja7yOktzNFTaeKAVZLXZgejCTmdpUPLfBSGEuAdlUDl0dxbN9FfDOFTsQM9nWxM3I65WvSrVBNS9HOrhTzaoRS5oIneIm_wNtxAPD_rFAjfq3tSRTnZz-N5vUrVLiukaNymmIHqIemXqMee9Hwl19gM0kECHpr4nOjGPs2zL7rtEf-dtAoavoxhtpN2c4dKp7qbT8MO2c6lZNg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNh5WKT4JmIWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Mavis Dlamini (59), a domestic worker from Emmarentia, said: “A background check should be done because they are messing with our reputation.” Sinah Radebe, who works in Greenside, said: “Foreigners are often a problem because they don’t have proper documents. “They ask for small wages, but in return they steal. “Not only do they create mistrust with employers, they make it hard for us to find jobs because they ask for less money.” Brigadier Vish Naidoo couldn’t confirm whether domestic workers stealing from their employers was a national problem. “However, it’s in the homeowners’ best interests to do a proper background check before bringing people into their homes,” he said.
