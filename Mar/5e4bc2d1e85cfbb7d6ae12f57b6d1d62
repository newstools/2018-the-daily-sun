THE Democratic Alliance (DA) Leader Mmusi Maimane is setting
out the DA's position on land reform at the Constitution Hill, in Johannesburg.Addressing the media on Monday, Maimane said addressing the
land reform issue in South Africa has moved too slow."The DA is committed to redressing land dispossession
in our country but it must be done in line with the Constitution," Maimane
said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv0WJgy-KbdsSceaCsIH0VS5HOIL8ZkihLjy2qDiMvDnzBY3Ep51kH_FvlHRaeyhEjPJwQ5H64MyjhOGoVbQfe_ENO1MUO5oy41wo_qKc-NtPC9lwiX-G2WJNt7miITBtjLHI9lEdPx4K9U2CbbPsNwLk-VX29ASUKRR6xRCtmkKJpRT2GPy-2-vB2Txe7uTtFjlXKiuSFH5fMA-xZIKdPy8wPwK7V5N_w7e9SaymOtYpAcuNWsqYHbnu_IDe5Hm-HdTwoM3Bka4ijVTOqhvB8nfm-rGh4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEJcxQ1TKq3cEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

real homeowners and protect their right to build assets and wealth over time."This is the only way to break the cycle of
inter-generational poverty that Apartheid has left us," Maimane added.Maimane suggested that the model pursued by the Economic
Freedom Fighters (EFF) would strip all property owners of their property."White and black
South Africans alike would lose everything.""We reject the suggestion that people cannot own
property or should be permanent tenants of an all-powerful state," Maimane said.However, Maimane highlighted that the DA is the only party
in South Africa that has focused on changing ownership of urban land, by making
sure that beneficiaries of state subsidised housing have full ownership titles to their homes.Maimane further added that the Constitution also makes it
clear that property does not only refer to land."The model pursued by the EFF would strip all property
owners of their property - white and black South Africans alike would lose
everything.Homeowners would be stripped of their homes, business owners
of their businesses, innovators of their intellectual property," Maimane
said.
