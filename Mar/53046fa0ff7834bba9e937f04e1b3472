WHILE
residents have lost all their belongings in the floods as heavy rains hit
several kasis in Tshwane over the weekend, some had a reason to smile. Solomon
Nkosi (48) saved a toddler who almost drowned in a shack at the Sizanani
informal settlement as water levels rose to dangerous levels.The
kasi in the east of Mamelodi was hammered by heavy rains which flooded shacks
in the area from Thursday evening until Saturday morning, forcing residents to
evacuate their homes.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssbS_vtb76xCUubUWLflppFhplj3v5R_OwhUDjF_akjvz3PvrLkVEr9yuISnbMJK2mgEZDwr8vvKB225dtCFKHrZgcXyLYLc1D6yJMWOlsII8PzP6_qr89HrlWnank7q-sAHY49H67m7fvCDeEu0e3IAwiwPZ2yvhGnE-FAifzDo8jFW5pB7XSkaXyfAHkdeqI826kbXKA6VHJd9h_V_EzE1LH0azvit66pxIgiedbdMXgaiwwNMICKBhGa9QMcrpAfRR9oFmUaS0ndUNO3gH84ze-wKCo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEPYUUREQTC4EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

lost their furniture and other valuables including important documents that
were damaged by the floods.While
the rains have stopped, residents are now struggling to recover using the
little they have left.When
the SunTeam visited the area, we learned about Philemon’s heroics which saved
the life of an 18-month old baby boy on Friday as the downpours persisted.Philemon
told Daily Sun he was walking in the floods with other residents checking the
extent of the damage on their shacks when they heard a baby crying.“We
rushed and found the baby on the bed without the mother and the water was
rising in the shack,” he said.Philemon
said the storms caused massive damage to residents’ shacks in the kasi.Hope
Mahlare (33), the mother of the child said she left Junior inside the shack to
get help from her neighbour as there was water coming into her shack.Hope
said when she returned; she found Philemon carrying the child.She
said she was thankful to Philemon for saving the child's life.Hope
said they lost bank cards, identity documents, money and groceries in the
floods.“We
lost everything but I’m happy that my son Junior is alive and well,” City
of Tshwane released a statement on its website which said 41 incidents of flooding
were caused by persistent downpours of rain. “Storm
water drains were blocked and could not handle the massive amount of water and
debris that were entering certain areas.Residents
in Pienaarspoort were moved to areas of refuge in community halls after their
shacks were flooded and the rising water posed a danger,” read the statement.The
city warned residents against crossing flooding streams and rivers.
