There was so much fighting between them. I am just an entertainer who was invited to perform. I was stuck in the middle of it all. I would love to still perform in Zambia in the future", she told the publication.Zodwa was meant to perform on Saturday in Lusaka at the launch of a music album organised by a local entertainment company called Sunset Sound Production.The organisers of the show said in a statement earlier in the week that Zambia’s National Arts Council had rejected their application.“The Council stated that... Zodwa’s performances were not in the public interest and undermined our national values,” the statement read.
