MARITZBURG United’s Fadlu Davids is eyeing silverware in his maiden season as head coach of an Absa Premiership team.The 36-year-old Davids, the youngest coach in the top flight, was appointed on a two-year deal with an option to renew for another year at the beginning of the campaign following an impressive spell on an interim basis. He took over as head coach late in the first round last season when Ernst Middendorp resigned, and again in the second round when Middendorp’s replacement, Roger de Sa, also stepped down. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstg8Z0LgYeNsyWNDNY1g5fchMgiqHkB29QyNYwQhKwrmZIPgmnJBTc2XlNpdhuL4NPB8wQTWgrFa0Q1cAAFZ0re1mMDROBD6Y4uIw8Aaaxq5j6N8L8RDkhatuiD7M3Zegh3EOp5oy78KpgIORykI7dydHzJXDGTlGe5-UPEB-cDakK8BpKGGqdx_QwWlUgK1gp20dtZbSRGA6H9TJZQTsKsmken23jj4i58NFFjuPBeebfRGaTpSj4Aq6GQ_8f2XefvaJ7daJH3Np42sBrV\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGdpTPUR4B5jEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

This season Davids has taken the league by storm, with his Team of Choice proving the surprise package of 2017-18. They are enjoying a good run that has taken them to third place in the league standings despite the youthful and inexperienced nature of the squad.They are five points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundows and trail second-placed Orlando Pirates by four points with six games remaining.Their impressive form has also seen them reach the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals. The KwaZulu-Natal outfit will host Bloemfontein Celtic in the Ke Yona Cup quarterfinals at Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm).The Team of Choice also played in the MTN8 earlier in the season thanks to their seventh-place finish, but were eliminated in the quarterfinals. Davids says their target is to reach the Nedbank Cup final but they have a tough task ahead against Celtic, who lost in the final of the Telkom Knockout late last year.He said: “You know, teams always bring their A-game in cup competitions, and Celtic, having played in that final, will be the favourites in this encounter. We will need to up our game and not bank on what happened when we played them earlier in the season.”United thrashed Celtic 4-1 at the same venue in the first round of the league. Maritzburg will be without injured Brian Onyango and Luyanda Ntshangase, who is still in hospital after he was struck by lightning earlier this month.“We’ve been doing well but need to tighten our defence. Celtic have experienced players in attack,” Davids added.
