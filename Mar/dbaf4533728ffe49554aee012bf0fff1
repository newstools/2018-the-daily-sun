WATER tanker drivers formerly contracted to the uMkhanyakude District Municipality in northern KZN are unhappy about not getting full-time jobs. They received letters last week telling them that yesterday was their last day.  One of them, Petros Mthembu (48), claimed the letters did not state reasons why they were shown the door. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu5wBfr7Bn5sHxErOjQfYlgHwcuSW_Fx3sW4YgXoQNxlmEMXk-oF1pbaBhCzElp1TS8135AZiYW9weaTdILapw2rFp4gR3Evjj6A5okQ9ETYkfGVk6ufO6h-LMpJOhR2b9V46O8jTRbwE1k57JYsGFxRNgGebKZ5KwvSg32VdxlAxaD_lPiwKBdHzueVa4k12hRy6_bkL7qdrwIW77hXHS-3u5w2Ibr4VoS1g1P0urrGMfgP88ZRQReZKAFV1Z3y65URN6nLP4nZSCDyMkH3k90vtCrXLM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFkpM0eN-8uOEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

None of us have been hired. All 17 of us were interviewed and tested.”Another driver, Alpheos Simelane (50) said they heard rumours a few individuals within the municipality ousted them so that they could give the jobs to whom they wanted.Asked if they have informed the municipality of their complaints, he said: “We will meet shortly to discuss a way forward.”Municipal spokesman Mdu Dlamini said: “The complaining drivers were inherited by the municipality and we took them in on a contractual basis.  “During interviews and testing, 14 of them failed. Only three passed. “We employ suitable and competent employees. Their claims aren’t true.“There were traffic experts involved during the selection process.”
