THIS coming week represents a rare quiet moment for Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane as their fixture list gets tighter.Pressure returns for the Brazilians on Sunday (3pm), starting with a Nedbank Cup quarterfinal date with their arch-rivals, Cape Town City, at Cape Town Stadium. They will then welcome Chippa United for an Absa Premiership fixture on 4 April before trekking to Polokwane for a date with Baroka FC on 8 April.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvZ6HMZmHqcJc231jvMjj9vlYNo7MHb6OYabMkibTNUxkb-ySHC6lUVt2EH-kAhjAMWXyUmQBtTkMWG6fa9LPuC00qZwW4rjLq9Q8KvPdueeT1bOhre4BTxXFOnezPGRLvZkdN0yM93I_HsqDI7mA9iLi534efUt1TYVSiPFvIFlMGGejPkigh4guQRApW-ruc-FTzbMninK6YozlLpY5V3mNyNjOQlZub7efP01ljmUWgRbaK4YQXorkfuAzG5XyFH50dr13mcDfuQXBbv\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMPmJTOzFXpIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But this could be the season he reclaims the League Cup for the Tshwane giants.“Percy is an unbelievable player. I’m waiting to see who will be able to challenge him for Footballer of the Season,” Mosimane has said.“He is scoring goals and he is providing assists. He just shows that talent alone is not enough, you must back up that talent with hard work.”Mosimane has sufficient firepower in his arsenal to let Tau share the load, and he will also rely heavily on the likes of Gaston Sirino, Sibusiso Vilakazi and Themba Zwane to keep their dream of a double alive.Said the coach: “We are going for all of them (trophies). Maybe we are a little greedy because my vision is to always go for it and see how it plays out. “It is easy to say ‘leave the Nedbank Cup because it will distract us, we’ll just go for the league’. But no, it’s not like that.”
