Daily Sun published a story of Sweetboy on 16 January, but the determined little monster has featured in stories in the People’s Paper at least three times in the past.She said they called Centlec, the technicians who work with Mangaung Metro Municipality, to try and help them get the power back.“When their man showed up with a torch to look at the power box, he was attacked with a shoe and he ran for his life.”On Monday, they came back with their photographer to take pictures of the power box. “We heard the photographer screaming in the bedroom. “When we went to look, he said he had been attacked by a flying coat hanger.”The couple said Sweetboy has so far won the battle with the sangomas.“Sangomas came to the house but failed and ran away. “A pastor came and prayed and blew a whistle but that didn’t help,” said Makgotso.Centlec spokesman Lele Mamatu confirmed the attack on his staff on Sunday night and Monday afternoon. He said they have a new power box for the family but their staff were being attacked by an invisible thing. He said they will install a new power box today.
