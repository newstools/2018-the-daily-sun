Student Khuselo Fihlani said he was supporting the guards in their protest when he was injured by a rubber bullet.University spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo condemned the violent incident.“The instability started when three guards were fired by Xhobani but demanded to be insourced,” she said.Tukwayo said they were still unsure whether live ammunition was used or not. She said they have not yet made a decision regarding the issue of insourcing and outsourcing.“We’re still working out the numbers so that we can know how much it would cost.” Mthatha police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said: “Police are investigating three cases of attempted murder and one of malicious damage to property after a Xhobani car was stoned. No arrests have been made.”
