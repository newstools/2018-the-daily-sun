There were people at the clinic. It’s hard to believe that nobody saw what was happening,” she said.“I was called by the security guard and when I investigated I found that three taps were missing from the women’s toilet.” Morare said the clinic only has two security guards. “We can’t search everyone who comes and out. We have not opened a case,” she said.¦ In 2013 a baby was found in the toilets at this same clinic.
