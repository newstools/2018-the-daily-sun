Western Cape police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a murder case was opened. “The body had multiple stab wounds,” said Rwexana.  “The dead man was wearing blue jeans and a red T-shirt.” Mitchells Plain cops have appealed to anyone with information about the dead man to contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
