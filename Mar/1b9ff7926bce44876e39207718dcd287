At the event attended by department employees, Pillay said he wants to root out fraud and corruption in government institutions.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuShV3nHw4n457Ai0lpAGFGC27OHUv81pzIhuZn4X1wSYraSa0ukfQFGpwd7pRdkeHQOU5SJssr2F6SZTzO7AiXeNEKBkahhhoXU_vFeiAiAL1We-YddOnfU3OZZCWmFG1gzLiMP2AEi_GXQRWjB1QytWSJIOiyez_ULSmGjWG2MrKsW3eP9IzVvZXrNC1KvHoPtPMG0H2MhDPJXPDw4Ls1spCECgJr18ijzWR8J6oN5Yj_J4unrkV5_IozQ-DnLIrvT0LhjiOVJ_hn7YZ6BgpMET-iVHo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzN4mYk6hU-UCEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The MEC said workers should know that the corruption prevention plan should be a daily expression of their working lives.“It is designed to make us live and work at a higher standard. We must ensure we deal with service providers and stakeholders at a higher level and force them to meet our standards,” said Pillay. “We are shifting gears to say the language of zero tolerance has now become a tired cliche. “Workers in this department have been investigated for fraud. Some were suspended while others decided to resign. We won’t tolerate corruption anymore.” He said anyone suspected of corruption would be investigated. “Nothing stays hidden forever. Sooner or later it will come out. When that happens, there will be serious consequences.” He urged managers to live and work by ethical standards and said the fraud prevention plan was a message to fraudsters who want to control the system.Thenjiwe Mdlalose (38) said she is happy about the campaign. “Corruption makes poor people suffer,” she said.
