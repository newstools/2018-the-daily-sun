We have sent many letters to the district and to the province but have had no response on whether we will get better classrooms or not.” Another pupil said she wanted to write her geography and life science papers but was stopped. On the day pupils boycotted class, teachers left and the principal apparently locked himself in the toilet, fearing pupils’ attacks.Cosas chairman Charles Makwakwa said inmates shouldn’t enjoy privileges in jail while pupils learn in leaking containers.The pupils threatened to spend the rest of the week on the street until Lesufi visited the school.Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said the MEC sent a team of officials on Tuesday to speak to pupils. “We are aware of infrastructure challenges at the school. “We have committed to build a new school but residents are undecided on where to build. We suggested an area 5km away from the current school but unfortunately they did not agree to it. It is frustrating for us, because we are ready to start the building process. “We appeal to pupils to be patient and continue learning. Disruption of schooling is discouraged. We will also interact with all stakeholders and hope a solution is achieved.”
