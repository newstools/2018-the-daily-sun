WHEN Maria Lekalakala was called by her ancestors and went to thwasa 13 years ago, she became a gifted sangoma. However, tragedy struck when she fell ill five years ago and lost her powers. The 49-year-old from block CV in Mabopane, Tshwane, is now living a miserable life. She spends most of her days praying to God to connect her with her ancestors. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssb9TPtvLsB-xHErV1SYSy-EfOXnsPpFew3l8xiX_w0S2ziQmM6zC_6S8KbkLeamxqFWwbZTTrNNAclnIFEMKFOKdqRitr5r4dwsQQVbnc1zEii4jzWswOoKO_Za3hlIom2-yiwIMMW1InTCZHKPVWm9kcwLAeskO-Fr_G2FobbTu3nJSTr4WnbnTx-Ay_mqAMeuzWJBiHiefbbolAJMJ6vXOCJCg1DdZemFdE6nOP_TcaXC_7V-gSFcGI19Tg45eLqyhZYq3l0r2t7CQmakGndL-MkF-w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOpQ0SXpmTmTEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

My connection with my ancestors has been cut off. I can’t even read the bones or heal people any more,” she said.Maria said she could feel something like a snake moving inside her. “It sits just below my breasts and when I sleep or rest, it moves up and down. The pain is unbearable,” she said. “Whether I drink medicine from the hospital or traditional healers, it just gets worse.“If I’ve wronged my ancestor in any way, I’m pleading for their forgiveness,” she said. Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said jealous rival sangomas might have used muthi to block her from reading the bones. “She needs a strong sangoma that can protect her from evil,” she said.
