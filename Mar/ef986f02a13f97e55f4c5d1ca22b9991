They were awaken up by a big bang outside their yard.Pinky and her children went out and couldn’t believe that half of the wall and the room were flattened.The Mercedes-Benz Viano driver mysteriously escaped unhurt. She said the driver was drunk.“I wanted to lay charges against driver  but he pleaded with me and asked me not to because he will build the damaged wall and the room,” said Pinky.Pinky agreed to the deal that the driver should build the wall and did not go ahead with opening the case. “I would be angry if they were arrogant. I would make sure that they get arrested.Neighbour Tshepo Masenya (41) said he the bang was so loud. He said when they questioned the driver, he claimed that he was avoiding a car that was speeding towards him on an oncoming direction. “There were bottles and glasses in the car. Probably the three men had a great night. He said according to the men, they say the owner of the car was asleeping when his little brother decided to drive them all.
