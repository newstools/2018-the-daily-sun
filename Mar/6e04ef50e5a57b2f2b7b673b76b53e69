All of them have the potential of becoming part of the national setup for years to come if they can impress Baxter in the upcoming tournament. Mokoena, who is no stranger to national team duty, having played for the Under-20s (Amajita) as well as for Bafana in Chan qualifiers, says it’s an achievement for him to be included.He said: “I have no words, I’m excited. It motivates me to work harder as a player. It is a big achievement for me and I cannot say how I feel right now, I’m speechless. “Every player has a dream of playing for Bafana Bafana and I’m going there to do my best, to showcase what I am capable of. Such opportunities come once in a lifetime. It is a challenge but I have to embrace it and keep working hard to make my mark.”Five players – Ndlovu, Petersen, Innocent Maela, Daniel Cardoso and Thembinkosi Lorch – will be part of the national team for the first time.Talking to his club’s website, Ajax Cape Town’s Petersen, who will be competing with experienced Itumeleng Khune and Darren Keet in goal, was also overwhelmed by the call-up.“Being part of the national setup has always been my aim, but obviously my main focus is on the job at hand – the specific moment in time. That is my priority.”
