I’m saying this because we already beat them here (at Harry Gwala) not so long ago. And we didn’t just beat them, we put four past them. This time around it will be harder for us. “They will come out guns blazing and we will need to be extremely cautious.”Davids will look to his perpetually hard-working 21-year-old star Siphesihle Ndlovu to continue with his good form, which has seen him getting a Bafana Bafana call-up. The midfielder will head into this match fresh from getting his first Bafana cap when they beat hosts Zambia 2-0 to win last week’s Four Nations tournament.Davids has a defensive headache ahead of this match, with his two experienced centre backs out. Captain Bevan Fransman will be serving his last match on suspension after receiving his marching orders against Royal Eagles in the Last 16 round. His cover, Brian Onyango, was stretchered off the pitch in the first half in the Team of Choice’s last league match two weeks ago, when they beat Platinum Stars. Davids is likely to field young Rushine De Reuck, who came on to replace Onyango and managed to form a healthy partnership with the experienced Siyanda Xulu.
