President Cyril Ramaphosa will be looking at issues
contained in an Institute of Race Relations (IRR) report, which alleges that
the budget allocated to VIP Protection Services exploded from R353m in
2008/2009 to R1.5bn in 2018/2019.According to the report's author, Gareth van Onselen, IRR
head of politics and governance, this budget will be spent on providing
protection services to the "president, deputy president, former
presidents, their spouses, and other identified dignitaries while in
transit".The report - titled SA’s Secret Police: Inside the
Multi-billion Rand Clandestine VIP Protection Services, further states that the
budget for VIP protective services is set to increase to R1.728bn in the
2020/2021 financial year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuXsAgvf3QE2ju_2MnKMmIqHjxNCkRiiwCP5RmW3fmBScfKq7DW5S1xtmsOxurpD1ALUv53otscQ2RTmiro6mlWfHJwhBKrOyMBsOqUk9QU_hLAQth0tG5rIa39RHY6uGbTs9l8lTkM1QrdI3mMxePf4HAfuBm41LFcfwwXxPDtzmzFTycGD0zW15t4GAB4V-dzGKeHGcgbGJNZHbyh1y0lfumK82zYele0P5YMZPYaEQxd6ZL2bdTJ3jwTktNzDu8MQtCtAUE267kdd7M7RfzFq3QVhsU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzB6boGMfx33tEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

the 2018/2019 amount of R1.5bn and the 2020/2021 budget exceeds the total
amount spent on VIP Protection Services for form president Thabo Mbeki’s entire
second five-year term from 2004 to 2009, which cost R1.444bn.In the report, expenditure exploded astronomically during
the ten years that marked the administration of former president Jacob Zuma,
increasing from R353m in 2008/2009 to R1.5bn in 2018/2019.Van Onselen notes that Ramaphosa would see out the last year
of Zuma’s second administration.Furthermore, over the ten-year course of Zuma’s two
administrations (2009/2010 to 2018/2019 inclusive), a total of R9.528bn would
be spent on VIP Protection Services, in comparison to the nine-year total for
Mbeki’s two administrations, which cost R2.343bn, according to the report.SOURCE: NEWS24
