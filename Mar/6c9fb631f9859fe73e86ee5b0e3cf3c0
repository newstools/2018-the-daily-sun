The men got angry and chased the women, wanting to beat them up, but they ran into a shop where the shop owner defended them.When one of the men beat up a magosha, the owner intervened and the man was beaten with his knife still in his hand. In the video which the SunTeam captured in East Burger Street, the woman in a red dress accuses her friend of smoking the men’s money. She then accuses her friend of taking her money as well. The two men confront her demanding their money back while they slap her around and she runs into the store where one man kicks her. The man then follows the woman into the shop where he is attacked by angry people and his knife is broken. He is kicked, his head is knocked against a street pole and he’s hit with a brick and finally has his long dreadlocks pulled.The two men managed to get away. The women later said they had used the men’s money without poking them. One said: “I didn’t want to be poked. I just wanted money to buy drugs.”
