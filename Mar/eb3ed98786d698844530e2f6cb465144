We don’t even last six months in a place before we’re evicted.“I applied for an RDP in 2008.”After gogo arrived in Joburg from KZN 35 years ago when her husband died, the family rented in Kagiso. “I already had two children. My children grew up and had kids and their children had kids as well. “The landlords complain there are too many of us and that we waste electricity and water,” she said.The gogo said she has a plan to get a place to stay.“I go alone as people feel sorry for an old woman. But the minute I go to fetch my furniture and family, the landlord complains,” she said.Her two children are Precious (46) and Zwelibanzi (34). Precious has four children, Keneiloe (27), Thabile (22), Lorang (12) and Bokamoso (2). Keneiloe and Thabile have two children each and Zwelibanzi’s kids live with their mum.No one in the family is working.“We can’t find jobs, not that we aren’t looking, but we are just not lucky,” said Zwelibanzi.They all survive on gogo’s social grant. Social development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said they will send a team to see how they can help.Human Settlements’ Keith Khoza said his department is working hard to improve conditions for Gauteng people by providing them with decent houses.“Our system says Nobantu applied for a house in 2013 and we will investigate the inconsistency, since other information says she applied in 2008. If the subsidy is granted she will be included, based on her being a pensioner. “She will be prioritised for a house, depending on the number of houses available in her region.”
