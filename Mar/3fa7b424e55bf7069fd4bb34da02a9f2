It helps if I have on some underwear.”He said he resisted designing underwear for years because he didn’t want to lose control of quality production, but “it’s one of the last product categories that I did not have and did not make”.Underwear or the lack thereof aside, Ford said he is actually a fan of “uniform” dressing for himself, when he is more just Tom, the dad. Not actual uniforms but identical sets of clothing STYLE Magazine reported. The lace underwear is currently available online for about R72 each.   1/2
