ROYAL Eagles coach Roger Sikhakhane says he will give his full support to at times wayward attacking midfielder Masibusane Zongo as he re-builds his career in the National First Division.The dribbling wizard who has represented numerous of Absa Premiership outfits such as SuperSport United, Chippa United and Platinum Stars, joined Eagles in the NFD after being released from a stint in jail.However, he was reportedly released after an alleged rape charge against him was dismissed. In the past with his previous teams, he has never lasted long due to a variety of disciplinary issues.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuoVQRC9gp6eX2596PpxHRveWyne7NqZ2-m9uAXSsXmWrvi-wV7RwEu5aTMkxgKFRI2rDPDlxEaBSbkgnfWYvFF-L4B4CyciFfcW_iLkZ-gqC7-yaxW33QxXC0gxF6A0LgKZZIx_BOCHkEYROmmSizcspaPfOgfREWvOLK80lLuvW4NC32daDmg24ttTnUoYOoTnHe-7LyNE812xx8gGfdZXz3PDvYcWlo5wZDRrNmJ8muNe_Gnzs_sDyuHileGJwMOruJW9GAJSkI2oN3r\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNzjAyYYcuSSEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I do not want to dwell on what happened in his past."My job is to help him improve, as one of my players. I work with players who show commitment at training and he is doing just that.Â "It would be unfair to speak about his past. Let's face the future by forgetting all the negativity. He is very important to the club and I want to help him resurrect his career."I do not want to put too much pressure on him by saying how much I rate him. Everyone knows Zongo and what he's capable of. I treat him like all the players in the team."
