I do not want to dwell on what happened in his past."My job is to help him improve, as one of my players. I work with players who show commitment at training and he is doing just that.Â "It would be unfair to speak about his past. Let's face the future by forgetting all the negativity. He is very important to the club and I want to help him resurrect his career."I do not want to put too much pressure on him by saying how much I rate him. Everyone knows Zongo and what he's capable of. I treat him like all the players in the team."
