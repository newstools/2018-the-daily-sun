LEARNING at Wesselton Primary School in Ermelo, Mpumalanga has been difficult due to power cuts. The school has apparently been without electricity for three months due to its bill of R169 285,77 which hasn’t been paid till today, forcing the Msukaligwa Municipality to withhold power.An angry teacher told Daily Sun the school resorted to using a small generator to keep going until the bill is settled. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssdlfskaI1RPjqqlkjjPERZ5yn7vfP-kT--f2RSIwrkXuMkqjiAFWlQGF7BVKIKWSVg0ZinfC4LENwvM4Wq3frX6u6bvG5zlnMTqt0lMLN1DkCfbeaQxWIXNTLH4JGdjpJDJXuBIxXl05Ai9yitPlz-X_X5WnHU9racJROEOukddglLmcQ4ZreirDToykDJdrFSD3Ve7YVaxzmBevCV-oo0gfwACsEUNvybWGDLpsjtddrHFj96yJQRwtOaQugr_k9OoTtBT9f5wiUdii7qvMZXipG8UjY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPBkAZxybHGIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I thought it was a small problem that would soon be solved.“We are waiting for a meeting to get all the answers,” he said. Municipal spokesman Mandla Zwane said electricity was disconnected at the school due to arrears on its account. He said last year, the principal arranged with the municipality to settle the debt in 15 months but didn’t keep his promise and a final notice was sent to the school before it was disconnected. Education spokesman Gerald Sambo said the issue is between the school and the municipality. He said the department allocates a budget to help schools every year with daily operations. School management and SGBs are responsible for financial management, including their electricity.
