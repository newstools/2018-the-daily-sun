Many youngsters look to us for inspiration, so it is important to keep doing well. I want to maintain my winning streak,” he said.“It has been a while since we last had a world champion from here. I want to keep winning so I can be crowned world champion one day,”. The last world champion to hail from this region is former International Boxing Organisation lightweight champ Malcolm Klassen, who won the title two years ago but lost his champion status due to inactivity. Bonokoane’s trainer Pius Dipheka said his charge was ready to rumble and advised their opponent to bring his A-game or be prepared to kiss the canvas. “We have been hard at work preparing for this contest. Pambeni must bring his A-game – we are a prepared for a real battle and he will be punished. We have prepared Thato to go the distance but if Pambeni is not careful he will get knocked out,” he said.“Thato improves his ring craft more in each fight, now I’m convinced that he is ready to take the international route. I need one more fight at home, then he must tackle the international arena,” said Dipheko.
