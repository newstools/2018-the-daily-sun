Bongumusa said someone tried to burn his brother inside his shack in January, but neighbours were able to put out the fire. Residents said the person who burned the couple recently wanted to make sure they were dead and stood outside to stop anyone trying to help.Apparently, a resident was shot at while trying to put out the fire.The families are in the dark about what really happened, and why.But one man told Daily Sun there was a fight between Eastern Cape migrants from eNgcobo and Mpondos.Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said murder cases are being investigated after two bodies were found shot and burned.“Circumstances are being investigated. And no arrests have been made yet,” she said.
