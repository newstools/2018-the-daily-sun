Opponents seem unable to put the brakes on them and they look set to walk straight into the top flight.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsukahSVGBF98MJs9w0soiXC8s8l0r9L9T7BoqD6GJKfcw5mXz2uXjHQH0BW0qrZZ3jONRTCxAcz25FzUs9uEnoKJVQghI7KG-dgWt1O4eVXu9H9FquY7jDtAnLwKAj8vcSQT_i8zXByVTPL-uNQvO5ycrJqmYmWbeQf048tZkB2khdQO-nN8Hfr92dz-YPPK54-UXgemhJyQXr4NfxNwuO_r9HCg4ilenmlfGeq-eoNzyPX1cckDTgm4oSS8zQnc0hzr3hwK-VBwCIOHg9NMi4y1Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKEsH_Ph1c52EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Their last defeat was on 23 September when they lost 1-0 to the same Mbombela at KaNyamazane Stadium. That was before the appointment of Da Gama, who has yet to taste defeat in the league since joining the club with his assistant Freese.And now, with six games remaining in the season, they are two victories away from being guaranteed a PSL spot for the 2018-19 season.The roaring Lions of the North have moved 15 points clear at the top of the NFD table following their thrashing of Mbombela at their slaughterhouse, Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa, over the weekend.Their chief abilities this season, which have propelled them into the position they occupy today, were their free-scoring strikers and tendency to concede less frequently. In 24 matches played so far, they have scored 47 goals and conceded just 10.Former SA Under-23 player Mothobi Mvala, who was part of the 2016 squad that represented Mzansi at the Brazil Olympics, as well as Namibian international Peter Shalulile, are two of the players who have played key roles this season.The pair, who were also part of the team when they gained promotion to the top flight via the play-offs in 2015-16, have contributed 20 goals this season. Mvala has scored nine and Shalulile 11.Although they have 53 points to their name along with the 15-point lead on second-placed Black Leopards, Mvala played down talk that they are on their way to the PSL.“One match at a time,” he insists. “If not for our team spirit, we wouldn’t be where we are now. All credit goes to my teammates. We’re heading in the right direction. Credit must also go to senior players like Tapuwa Kapini, as well as the coaches. And we’ve had luck on our side.”
