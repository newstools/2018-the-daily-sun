THEY fought in the struggle for the freedom that South Africans enjoy today.The apartheid police hunted them down, and like criminals they were hanged.Yesterday, the families of nine PAC members hanged by the apartheid government in the 1960s took the same painful walk to the gallows their relatives had moments before they died. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvxzIDkgeONmPtEVVZ6crblY--YHQzlLHidhS0kq2NNMwmNYuXWBUxpFvn_LRVjFYL4CcMxpGwQFAoPRmiMNcwpjydywSnz_lPhg5V0JBiSPiTKCjmFdadcM8ANv7ao9XSIlGlITh0Bk3jDzq2c401-Hfce9uOaG33OxTddaLGUUOvo_QvhCzlPNnCg38SeGPk-gXxEw8YUbZ15G3F5js9ibT4I9cs_JlmYkFDdum-62djYJvFPEWHEMjCus2lSaRGw1QXj_r91mtVswj81GB_IIONW6P0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJAgIzy8RIKHEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Maqadaza Magushe (32), Goduka Gelem (38) and Mcdonald Mgweba (30) were hanged on 30 May 1967 for the killing of shopkeeper Maurice Berger.Titus Nyovu (29) was hanged on 14 October 1963 for the murder of Renschia Vermeulen.Jonathan Sogwagwa (30) was hanged on 27 September 1963 for killing Poqo member and suspected informer George Tshisa. Vanele Matikinca (35) was hanged on 14 October 1963 for killing suspected informer Klaas Hoza.Joseph Mqitsane (28) and Aaron Njokwana (23) were hanged on 11 December 1963 for killing three young women who had broken Poqo rules. Nkosencinci R Maseti was hanged on 26 September 1967, also for killing Hoza. Many of the families had to travel from as far away as the Eastern Cape to get closure. They were relieved to receive the remains of loved ones, which were exhumed at Mamelodi West Cemetery on Tuesday. They said giving their relatives proper burials would bring closure.
