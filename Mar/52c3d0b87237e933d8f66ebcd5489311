PHIL Masinga often tells his story of hardship and perseverance as a way of motivating overseas-based players. But even the words of the Bafana Bafana legend may not be encouraging enough for Lebogang Manyama at this point.Manyama is currently going through the worst spell of his career at Turkish side Konyaspor.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv3VQMFuBZ-rkKIBGVq75eW3RG_GAfsP9dNwxfm_0QO8RpYgxw_W36SxGoyiPX8HeGVzxT_SQDhvr2rAc-9QiP8BxZc2_3ykVLXl8qUpuqRpK0sWzmHsdvtY1NUG3oicmW6C-D_TCLyo31l0byUUL9W2EjqKDPNVi7uYox7VYICDZAXxPtPSR6WaCeXhIJrlDskl6d9fMVen8JNFGnZFULIyjpiihtid-SFb3AFLhDDCQtnRKvUz-Fv971WiOHtUmRxmQVAIwGNg6kDvdl_\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNYNZiRC7l4BEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He is unlikely to see out his three-year deal at Konyaspor, and a move back home could soon be on the cards for him.The former Cape Town City skipper will not be short of suitors should he decide to return to the PSL, having won the PSL’s Footballer of the Year, Top Goal-scorer and Player’s Player of the Season crowns. Local players are often accused of lacking the character and drive to stick it out and succeed outside the country’s borders.But Manyama can hardly be accused of such, as he has hardly played a single match for Konyaspor, let alone sat on the bench this year. The Bafana midfielder completed only one of the seven league matches he has played so far this season and has effectively played a mere 180 minutes of football.He was nowhere to be seen as Konyaspor sunk to a 1-0 defeat to Yeni Malatyaspor at the weekend, dropping deeper into the relegation zone in the Super Lig.In his early days at Leeds United, Masinga battled to adapt and it wasn’t easy either for his teammate and compatriot, Lucas Radebe.“There was no looking back. Once you signed a contract, you knew it was the beginning of a new journey and coming back home was not an option,” said Masinga.Like this story?
