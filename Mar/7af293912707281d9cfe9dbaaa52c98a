The family was notified later that afternoon.“We went there and found his left foot and both his hands had been cut off. “The clothes he was wearing were full of blood. It was the worst sight I have ever seen in my life,” said Thembi.Now the family will have to cremate his body so the vultures do not come to finish him off. She said what hurts most is that he was abused in his final resting place. A spokeswoman at Pienaar Police Station, Captain Jabu Ndubane, said a case of violation of a grave was opened and the corpse was taken to the pathology laboratory for further investigation. “Once the investigations are done his body will be cremated,” said Ndubane.Last month police made arrests relating to the kidnap of 13-year-old Gabisile Shabane and her 15-month-old cousin, both of whom were living with albinism. The two were abducted from their home in Hlalanikahle, Emalahleni, Mpumalanga and were found dead some days later.According to Phephsile Maseko, national co-ordinator for the Traditional Healers Organisation, whoever chopped off the body parts is probably practising witchcraft.“It is a lie that body parts can make strong muthi,” said Maseko. “People living with albinism are human beings and they should be respected. Those who are involved in this barbaric behaviour should face the law.”Bongi Mkhabela (29), who also lives with albinism, said she no longer feels safe. “There is too much fear. We feel as if our safety is compromised because we don’t know what people are thinking and planning behind our backs.“There are still people who think our body parts make great muthi but they must stop. “We are human beings just like everyone else.”
