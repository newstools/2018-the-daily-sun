Balton would not reveal the names of the schools where this happened, but said most of them were in Gauteng and Western Cape.He said these situations led to pupils making friends only from their own race. “Some schools lack the capacity to deal with racism.“We have an ongoing dialogue with these schools to fully address the issues and at some schools tension has subsided,” said Balton. “It also depends on the school leadership. When the leadership is weak these are the results.” He said it also appeared that some education district offices did not have the necessary capacity to deal with racism. “At these schools, pupils never get to learn and appreciate diversity,” he said. “This kind of behaviour will remain after school and they will take it to their workplace.” The foundation has been organising educational talks across the country under the theme #RootOutRacism and it recently launched the Zimele app to report incidents of racism.
