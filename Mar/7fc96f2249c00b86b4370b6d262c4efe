When Clement was released last Friday, he opened a case of assault. Captain Mega Ndobe said police are investigating.Gauteng Correctional Services spokesman Mocheta Monama said parolee Clement was held at Boksburg Correctional Centre on 8 January, after the board revoked his parole following violations and non-compliance with his release conditions. During his temporary stay at the facility, he could use all facilities and services offered to offenders housed there, including medical treatment. “Gugulethu was offered an opportunity to open a case after speaking to the head of the centre about allegations that her husband was assaulted by officials and refused medical treatment. But she refused to exercise that right. “Internal investigators were instructed to investigate the offender’s allegations. They hit a brick wall and couldn’t continue when Clement refused to co-operate. “He was released on 23 February after he paid a fine for theft committed before his imprisonment.”
