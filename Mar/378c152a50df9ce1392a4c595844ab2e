Apparently, the suspects were travelling in a black VW Jetta. Lebakeng Mofokeng (30) from Freedom Square told Daily Sun: “Fifteen minutes after I left the store to buy a bag of potatoes, I heard people screaming as all hell broke loose.“I wanted to see what was happening but I was afraid of getting hurt and decided to wait a distance away. “I saw five men leave the store carrying black bags. They ran to their car and drive away.” Police spokesman Masilela Langa said: “We confirm that three suspects broke into a Usave supermarket and stole an undisclosed amount of cash.“They fled the scene, driving a black VW Jetta. “No arrests have been made and we are still looking for the suspects,” said Langa.
