I turned around and saw the woman walking towards me. She told the taxi driver to drive off,” she said.But to her surprise, it wasn’t a woman but her ex dressed as a woman and wearing a wig. “He grabbed my clothes and pulled my weave. Before I could even finish asking him what he was doing, he took out a container and poured the liquid over my face,” she said. “I spent a long time in hospital while the police struggled to trace him. He finally contacted me and asked to see me. I told him I was being discharged that day.”They agreed to meet and when she unmasked herself, her ex was left weeping, rolling on the ground as people watched. He was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in jail.“My whole life has changed. No one wants to give me a job and I was the breadwinner. Four of my late sister’s children dropped out of school because I could no longer pay. “My daughter has also dropped out of university. I’m pleading with SunLanders to help me fix my face so I can be employed again and support my family.”
