IT is understood that his proposed salary was a stumbling block for Sibusiso Khumalo in signing for AmaZulu. Khumalo was recently released by Kaizer Chiefs and a source close to the player said Usuthu wanted Khumalo, but only if his salary could be cut by 35%. “AmaZulu did actually contact Khumalo about his services but it didn’t work out. Khumalo was earning a lot of money at Chiefs and AmaZulu wanted to cut his salary by 35%. The two parties couldn’t agree on terms,” said the source. Usuthu have since moved on to sign their former left-back Marc van Heerden from Orlando Pirates. Van Heerden was also only released recently and Usuthu team manager Qedi Dlamini has already confirmed that the club is set to sign the left-footed player before the week ends. AmaZulu also confirmed that they are expecting a verdict from the Premier Soccer League regarding the complaint they lodged late last month. The sitting was held last week and the club’s general manager Lunga Sokhela said the ruling should be delivered this week. Said Sokhela: “We did our best, the judgment should be known this week. The sitting was held last week and the PSL said it would deliver the ruling in two weeks’ time. The two weeks end this week.” Usuthu lodged a complaint after they were dramatically replaced in the top eight of the Absa Premiership by SuperSport United. AmaZulu contested the ruling and felt that giving points to teams after the opposition had fielded an ineligible player was unprecedented and prejudiced them. “Judges have a lot to think about. We hope the judgment does not go against us,” added Sokhela. Usuthu have entered their second week of pre-season training and expect to have a better season this time around. In their first season back from the National First Division they finished eighth before the standings were altered.
