RESIDENTS of Hlohlolwane, Clocolan are gatvol. They claim that a blocked manhole hasn’t been fixed for several months. Mating Moya (63) told Daily Sun: “Our kasi smells badly because of the blocked manhole. It has been overflowing for months. We tried unblocking it, but we couldn’t because we don’t have rods.” He said municipal workers had unblocked the drain, but the problem started almost immediately again. “I think there’s a problem with the pipes, and it seems the municipal workers didn’t do a proper job. “We are now thinking of taking to the streets to get the attention of the municipality,” said Mating. “This problem is affecting our health. “We spend most of our time indoors because of the bad smell. “The municipality must urgently resolve this matter because we can’t live like this.” Moroesi Gaba, a spokeswoman for Setsoto Municipality, told the People’s Paper: “The municipality is aware of the situation and our workers often attend to the manhole. “But this continuous overflow is usually caused by foreign objects found in the manhole. “The municipality is monitoring the manhole to avoid an overflow.”
