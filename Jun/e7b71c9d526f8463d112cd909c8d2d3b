A WOMAN from Mapleton in Dawn Park heard several gunshots and was terrified to even peep through the window on Friday night. Little did she know she would be met with a gruesome sight the following morning. She found several bodies not far from her house. “A terrified woman notified the police of gunshots the previous night. “When she went to check in the morning she saw five bodies with bullet wounds in the upper body,” said Colonel Mack Mngomezulu. Mngomezulu told Daily Sun that police have since launched a manhunt. “Up to now we haven’t arrested any suspects and no one has come forward to identify the bodies. Police are pleading with anyone who may have any kind of information regarding these killings to contact the local police station.  They can also contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
