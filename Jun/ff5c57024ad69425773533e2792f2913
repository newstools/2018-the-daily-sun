SHOCKED relatives and residents watched in horror as Jomo Mbatha (46) was shot dead on Sunday. Jomo was killed by unknown suspects during his traditional wedding, leaving the bride and those who attended the ceremony reeling from shock. A police source said the wedding was stopped on Sunday and it continued on Monday, in line with family tradition and culture. “On Saturday they had a white wedding which went well, and on Sunday they were having their traditional wedding, which was going to be followed by umabo,” said the source. “However, because of the incident the traditional wedding was stopped and continued on Monday. The deceased’s brother stood in as the groom.” The two suspects came to the wedding and allegedly shot Mbatha as he was coming out of one of the houses, and they then fled. Mbatha’s brother Thelumusa (37) said the family was still trying to come to terms with what had happened. “We do not wish to speak to the media at this stage as we are still in shock. “Our makoti is also very upset and not ready to comment to the media about this. “We can confirm the wedding continued on Monday, but we are also urging you to give us space,” said Thelumusa. He told Daily Sun his brother and makoti had been together for about 20 years. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said one case of murder and one of attempted murder were opened at Nongoma cop shop. “The deceased was at his wedding at KwaNokhesheni Village in Nongoma when he was fatally shot by two suspects who fled in a VW polo. “During the shooting a woman (21) was injured and was taken to hospital.
