Proteas fast bowler Dale Steyn is set to make his much anticipated return to the Test team after a long spell on the sidelines with shoulder and heel injuries. The squad of 15 players set to do battle in Sri Lanka also includes the likes of Multiply Titans spinner Tubraiz Shamsi, who will be looking to add to his only Test cap. Shamsi is joined by fellow spinner and uncapped Titans teammate Shaun Von Berg as the Proteas look to exploit the spinner-friendly conditions of the subcontinent. “It is very welcome news to have Dale back in our pack of world-class seamers,” said selection convenor Linda Zondi in a media release, “particularly in view of the retirement of Morne Morkel. “Kagiso Rabada has also made a complete recovery from the injury concerns he had at the end of the Australia Test Series.” Rabada missed the Indian Premier League after sustaining a back injury in the final Test of the Australia series at the Wanderers. “A key factor in our selection process was to cover all our bases and all possible conditions that we may encounter in Sri Lanka. The two additional spinners to back up Keshav Maharaj have both had excellent records in recent times in our domestic cricket. Von Berg also gives us additional batting strength in the lower order.” Multiply Titans wicket keeper Heinrich Klaasen continues to provide glove cover for Quinton De Kock, although he may also be considered for a specialist batting position after the shock retirement of star batsman AB De Villiers.
