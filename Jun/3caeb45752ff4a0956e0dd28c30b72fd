BANYANA Banyana defeated Lesotho 1-0 to take the advantage in their two-legged final round of African Women's Cup of Nations qualifier on Wednesday. Leandra Smeda scored the solitary goal of the match that put Desiree Ellis charges closer to the AWC at the Setsoto Stadium in Maseru, Lesotho. Banyana are now going to host Lesotho in the second leg of the qualifiers which is set to take place at Dr Petrus Molemela stadium on Sunday (3pm). On their arrival in Lesotho early this week coach Ellis has been working hard on sharpening the goal-scoring exploits of the girls, but it still looks like the goal drought is still far from ending as they found the back of the net only once. A victory in the second leg on Sunday will confirm Banyana's spot in the AWC which is set to take place in Ghana later this year, and that will also see them edging closer to what could be their first ever World Cup. After qualifying for Afcon, in Ghana they will need to finish in the top three in order to qualify for the World Cup which is set to take place in France next year.
