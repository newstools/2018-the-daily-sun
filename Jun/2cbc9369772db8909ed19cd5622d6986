THE Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality is now only unblocking pipes for the needy. This has led to life becoming unbearable for many people in areas like New Brighton and Sidwell, in central Port Elizabeth. Athenkosi Yawa (25) from New Brighton said sewage had been flowing freely in his yard for two weeks, making his house a no go area. “I ran away from this kak because it stinks too much. I’m now staying with friends. “I’ve phoned the municipality four times and even visited them. They told us they only fix drains for people who have water and electricity subsidies.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki confirmed they didn’t fix blockages for everyone. “We only help people with subsidies from the metro. It’s the law,” he said.
