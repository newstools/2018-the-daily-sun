THE long-running land issue in Sicelo squatter camp in the Vaal has seen scores of protests on the R59. On Tuesday evening, two trucks were set alight by furious residents. They were protesting after they didn’t get feedback on a housing complaint. The first truck went up in flames at about 6pm, followed by another torching incident at about 6.40pm. Four vehicles were also stoned! Cops were still monitoring the area yesterday as protesters attempted to close the road again. Moses Mbhele, a resident, told Daily Sun they were protesting because Midvaal mayor Bongani Baloyi was not communicating with them. “We’ve had meetings to resolve housing issues,” he said. “All matters were resolved, and now we’re waiting for developments. “Residents heard rumours that there were new developments, but we haven’t heard from the mayor.” Moses condemned the torching of the trucks and called it an act of criminality. “As residents, we don’t condone looting and torching of trucks,” he told Daily Sun. Baloyi said: “Stoning vehicles, hijacking trucks, looting and the subsequent burning of trucks isn’t about service delivery,” he said. A case of public violence was opened and no arrests were made. Gauteng human settlements spokesman Keith Khoza said: “The provision of services is the responsibility of the municipality.” Khoza said that any questions must be referred to the Midvaal municipal council.
