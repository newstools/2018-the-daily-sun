FORMER SuperSport United midfielder Lebohang Manyama’s future is uncertain. The 2016-17 PSL Player of the Season has struggled for game-time since joining Turkish side Konyaspor before the start of last season. Having found the back of net 13 times to become the Absa Premiership’s top scorer the previous season, Manyama was never given a chance to prove his worth, as he has only played seven matches out of 30 since his arrival in Turkey. Manyama’s agent Maimane Phiri told Sunsport that they were waiting for the Konyaspor management to give them direction as he is still contracted to the club for two years. He said: “He is waiting for a letter from the Konyaspor management informing him what he should do. If they need him back they will send him flight tickets to return to Turkey for pre-season with the club.” However, Phiri says the arrival of new coach Sergen Yalcin towards the end of season has given Manyama hope. The former Turkish national team legend helped Konyaspor avoid relegation by the skin of their teeth as they finished fourth bottom with 36 points from 34 games. He said: “The new coach hasn’t had enough time to have a look at all his players which means Lebo will be given a fair chance to prove his worth. I am not worried about his future because he is talented and can find another club if things don’t work out there.”
