HE MADE headlines and earned praise from the cops when he saved a girl from falling to her death. The story of Anthony Ezeh (44) was published in the People’s Paper on 27 April last year under the headline: “Family welcome their hero.” But the Nigerian man said the same cops were failing him after he was assaulted by officers last October. He claims that he was wrongfully accused of murder and that the cops who beat him up later apologised. Anthony said he wanted to see his attackers behind bars, but the Parkweg cops were not helping him. “I was shocked when the cops came and said I was wanted for the murder of a woman whose cellphone had been stolen. Although I told them I had nothing to do with the killing, they arrested me anyway,” claimed Anthony. “I was taken to Parkweg Police Station, where I was detained and beaten to a pulp. “The cops later took me to the murder scene in Marquard, and it was the first time I was in that area.” Anthony claimed the cops later realised he was not behind the murder and released him. “A man they interrogated also at the time I was arrested was the one who killed the woman and who robbed her of her cellphone. “I went to the hospital and was shocked when I heard that my J88 form was missing. I think my case will go cold because the cops are protecting their colleagues. “I am not a criminal,” said Anthony. Parkweg police spokeswoman Constable Wendy Nkabi said the matter had been referred to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate for investigation. Moses Dlamini, a spokesman for the directorate, said: “I can confirm that we are investigating a case of torture against cops. “The matter has been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions and we are awaiting a decision.”
