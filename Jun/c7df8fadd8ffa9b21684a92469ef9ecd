MBHAZIMA Chauke (63) is a creative gogo! She expresses her Xitsonga culture in clothing. The gogo from Makuleke Village outside Malamulele makes traditional dresses and accessories, and decorates them with ribbons and beads. She started her business 20 years ago, after her husband died. Mbhazima told Daily Sun: “It was heartbreaking when he died. I was worried about how I was going to feed my poor family of eight and came up with the idea of making traditional products. “For two weeks, I taught myself to make traditional dresses, shoes, belts, necklaces and earrings. And after I mastered the skills, I started the business by making a few products. “They were snapped up. People wanted more and I produced them.” Mbhazima said her products are affordable. “Prices for my traditional garments range from R250 to R1 500. “Traditional shoes and belts between cost R40 and R120, and necklaces and earrings R30 to R100. She also passes her skills on to others. “Those who need to start small businesses can visit my home. I train them for free. I have already trained women who copied my skills. They are making something of their talent.”
