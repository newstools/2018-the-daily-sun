The 23rd of April 2018 marked exactly 10 years since the passing of legendary Gospel artist Vuyo Mokoena. The lasting legacy left behind by the iconic Gospel singer has ensured that although he is gone, he is not forgotten. Through the Vuyo Mokoena foundation, his widow Tebogo Mokoena, has helped keep his legacy alive by making a difference in underprivileged communities, something her late husband was very passionate about. The Vuyo Mokoena Foundation has started the LOL (Live One Life) initiative which apart from celebrating a decade since Vuyo Mokoena’s passing, will launch an effective after school programme within the community especially for schools that do not have extra mural activities. “My husband was so passionate about taking care of the needy, the underprivileged and orphans so we decided to start the Live One Life campaign under the Vuyo Mokoena Foundation to help deal with these socio economic issues,” said Tebogo. Vuyo’s songs, Umkhuleko and Lefatshe La Dikhutsanyane are an indication of just how strongly he felt about advocating for the less fortunate and highlighted his selfless nature. “He wrote those two songs primarily for street kids and orphans, it shows just how passionate he was about such issues,” Tebogo said. Tebogo also said they are hoping to do a tribute concert for Vuyo Mokoena towards the end of the year. “Vuyo was a great artist and we will invite some of the artists that he worked with, the likes of Rebecca Malope, Benjamin Dube and hopefully Dr Sonnie Badu, the international Ghanaian-born gospel musician, who paid his tribute by redoing Vuyo’s song We Bless Your Name,” said Tebogo.
