THE family of the three people who died in a crash involving an off-duty Metro cop received groceries on Thursday sponsored by South African Breweries. The parcels were delivered by traffic cops at the family’s home in Vlakfontein, south of Joburg. The cop who was driving the car last Sunday was found to be under the influence at the scene. Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said: “To the family, we’re sorry. We’re sad that we come to the family like this. “We feel deeply for you. We must let the law take its course.” Metro cops spokeswoman Edna Mamonyane said the company felt it necessary to lend a helping hand to the family. “In times like this it’s important to lend a helping hand. We should work together in such instances,” said Mamonyane. Speaking on behalf of the family, Phindile Qongo said: “We’re Christians. This is the devil looking to cause a rift between the family and officials. “We welcome you in our home. We’re grateful for the groceries you brought. We thank you for your efforts.” Qongo said they needed a mobile toilet and transport for the funeral. Mamonyane promised the family they’d organise a mobile toilet.
