THE girl and her friends were walking home from school and listening to music on their phones. But this apparently annoyed an off-duty traffic cop and almost cost the girl her life. The 17-year-old grade 9 pupil at Kabelo High School in Polokwane, Limpopo, claimedthe cop was sitting in the shade, drinking beer, when they passed him on Wednesday. The cop allegedly started insulting the girls, who were singing and dancing, and when they asked him what they had done wrong he got more angry. “He said even his children don’t question him,” claimed the girl. “He came towards us and we ran away. He took out a gun and shot at us. Three bullets missed me but the fourth one hit my ear. “My friends called my sister because I was bleeding heavily.” The girl’s sister (26) said she went to the scene with her neighbour. “My sister was lying in a pool of blood and the man who shot her was drinking beer with friends,” she claimed. Another girl claimed what the cop did surprised and shocked them. Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the 24-year-old cop was arrested and his gun was confiscated. “He appeared in the Polokwane Magistrates Court on Friday and will be back in court on Thursday,” he said.
