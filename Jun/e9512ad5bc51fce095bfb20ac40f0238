THE Western Cape Health Department has warned residents to be aware when using an imbawula. Many people, especially those who live in squatter camps, use them to warm their shacks. Health spokesman Sithembiso Magubane said: “Many people have been admitted to Khayelitsha Hospital for carbon monoxide inhalation. “The health department would like to inform communities of the risks of carbon monoxide inhalation as a result of using imbawula. “The increase in carbon monoxide inhalation cases takes place in winter as people use imbawula to keep warm.” Residents who spoke to the People’s Paper said they were always careful when using the braziers. “When it’s cold I often use imbawula to keep my mkhukhu warm. I make sure I’m careful around imbawula,” said Neliswa Ncipha (35) from Enkanini squatter camp. Another squatter, Lelethu Ciga (23), said: “I use imbawula to keep my one-month-old baby warm. “My shack has a small window that I keep open whenever I use it.” Magubane said signs of carbon monoxide inhalation are headaches, dizziness, vomiting, chest pains, flu-like symptoms and confusion. “Imbawula should not be used in an enclosed environment such as a house, shack or container. “After using imbawula, people should immediately kill the fire. “They mustn’t keep the imbawula in their shacks, especially at night.” Magubane said the only way for people to stay safe was to keep the imbawula outside a house.
