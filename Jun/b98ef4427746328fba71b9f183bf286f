EDWARD (67) and Norah (63) Meintjies of D1 in Mamelodi are wallowing in sorrow and regret. Their 29-year-old taxi driver son Kabelo ended his life. The distraught parents said their son committed suicide because he was R200 short on his daily check-in. They said Kabelo came home on Tuesday evening and asked them to lend him R200. But they ignored him because they didn’t know he was being serious. They said afterwards he went to his room and locked himself inside. Norah said at about 10pm, the taxi owner came to fetch his money and taxi. “We called out to Kabelo but he didn’t respond,” she told Daily Sun. “I told my grandchild to go and wake him up because I thought he was sleeping. “He told me Kabelo wasn’t opening his door. His dad went and knocked but there was no response.” Norah said they broke the window and told their grandchild to look in and see if there was someone inside. “He saw my son hanging from the ceiling,” she said. “We rushed and broke down the door, but it was already too late. He was dead.” Norah said they found a note on which was written “I’m sorry, mama” on his bed. His dad said at first they didn’t understand why he would end his life. But after going through his phone, they found countless messages of him asking people for money to make up for the check-in shortfall. “Had we known he really needed the money, we would have given it to him and he’d still be alive today. “He never told us why he needed the money. “The way he asked for it – he sounded like he was joking,” he said. The parents said they didn’t know their son was so scared of his boss to a point he’d end his own life, instead of facing the taxi owner. Mamelodi West police spokesman Captain Johannes Maheso said an inquest docket was registered with police.
