A VIRAL video showing a Zimbabwean journalist being cruelly humiliated for allegedly poking someone else’s wife has provoked a public outcry. Watch the video below! According to media reports, Clayton Masekesa, who works for Newsday newspapers, was bust at the home of Mutare City Football Club secretary general, Soul Tom last Thursday. He was accused of poking Tom’s wife – although some reports say it was Tom’s girlfriend, not his wife. Reports say that six men threatened and manhandled Masekesa, making him roll around fully clothed in mud, mocking and humiliating him. The video showing his humiliation was then shared on social media. But instead of making Masekesa the laughing stock of Zimbabwe, he has instead become a figure of sympathy. Twitter commentators have pointed out that adultery is not a crime, whereas assaulting and degrading someone is. There have also been reports that the six men responsible for the abuse and the video have been arrested and charged with assault.
