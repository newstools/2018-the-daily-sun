FIT-AGAIN Warren Whiteley returns to lead to the Lions against the Sharks in their Super Rugby match in Durban on Saturday (5:15pm). He missed six months with a groin injury last year and has battled to shake off a troublesome knee injury as he return was put on hold in May. But the eighthman’s comeback couldn’t be timelier as the Lions approach the business end of their campaign, needing all hands on deck to secure a spot in the playoffs. Also back from injury is Ross and Cronje Malcolm Marx, who is set to run out in his 50th Super Rugby match while Courtnall Skosan will play his first match of the year from the bench. Springboks Aphiwe Dyantyi and Ruan Combrinck are back covering the wings, Franco Mostert with Marvin Orie are at lock while Dylan Smith, Marx and Ruan Dreyer complete the front-row. The Golden Lions and Sharks clash in the SuperSport Rugby Challenge quarter-final curtain-raiser. As a company, The Lions Rugby are excited about the wealth of talent coming through the ranks after four youngsters represented South Africa at the World Under 20 championships in France recently. Some of the youngsters, Wandisile Similane, the SA U/20 vice-captain, Tyrone Green, Manuel Rass and Gianni Lombard have been named in the team to face the Sharks XV while PJ Steenkamp will start from the bench.
