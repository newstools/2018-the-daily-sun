DISEASES that attack banana plants are sweeping the
planet, threatening the survival of the fruit as we know it. Banana plantations in Australia, south-east Asia, the
Middle East and African countries are all facing death as a powerful plant
disease called Panama disease attacks them, according to The Guardian. Eleven African countries that grow bananas are also
grappling with another blight called banana bunchy top disease. Countries like
Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania face hundreds of thousands of job losses in the
banana-growing industry. So far, these diseases have not yet infected South
African banana plants. Besides the job losses, in many countries affected by
either disease, bananas are both a common daily food for locals to eat, and a
source of income through exports. The export of bananas internationally is worth about R233
billion every year. There are different varieties grown around the world, but
the type of banana that accounts for 99,9% of all bananas traded globally is
called the Cavendish. It was developed in Britain after disease wiped out
another popular kind of tasty banana in the 1950s. Now bananas are under renewed threat, with countries like
Britain, Israel, Ecuador and Australia racing to develop a type of banana that can
resist these diseases, as well as survive changing conditions due to climate
change. Eyal Maori, a scientist working on the project in Britain,
is quoted as saying: “It is just a matter of time before the Panama disease
reaches central and south America, which is why there is an urgent need to
develop a resistant banana.”
