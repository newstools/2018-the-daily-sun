Having to spend money on data is a thing of the past for the people of Phola kasi in Mpumalanga. Thanks to Glencore Mine’s corporate social investment programme, locals now can search and apply for jobs on the internet. Company representative Thys Marx told Daily Sun last week the project is aimed at improving residents’ lives. He said hot spot sites were chosen at places where many pupils pass through or where people meet, like at the library, sport field, taxi rank and at stalls in Ogies. “This is an opportunity for jobseekers to apply for jobs and for pupils to do research on the internet.” He said many residents struggle to pay for data and free internet access empowers them. “This is a tool to better their lives. “There’s no need to walk to internet cafes anymore for data. All they have to do is walk to their nearest hot spot. “We are working on expanding to other areas,including Middelburg and Siyathuthuka.” Tim Genders from service provider Project Isizwe said the 500 megabytes available to residents at these hot spots is worth R80 and will save locals a lot of money. Kate Masango (33) said the free Wi-Fi came at the right time as she was looking for a job and will use it to apply for posts advertised. Councillor Nomasonto Mofokeng from Emalahleni Municipality said they were grateful for such a practical project.
