Local radio and club disc jockey, Thato Sikwane, better known as DJ Fresh has turned his body into a canvas on which he can display some personalized art. Beside his super serious work-out regimen that has seen him build quite the body for himself, Fresh also has somewhat of a tattoo fetish. The DJ has tattoos all over his body but it's the work of art on his back that gets the most attention. Fresh has tattooed an outline of the African continent and inside the boarder are the faces of his favourite Africans. These include his 3-year-old son, Lefika, his late grandfather, Kgosi Mmipi and the late former president of Botswana Quett Ketumile Joni Masire. He also has local giant, Nelson Mandela tattooed within the boarder, He is now extending the story and adding more faces. This past week, Fresh visited his go-to tattoo artist Juan-Pierre Le Roux at RisingDragon Tattoo & Piercing parlor to get more work done. The new addition to the artwork is none other than the mother of our nation, mamâ€™ Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Check out the pics below: Big up @jp_tattooartist for getting me closer to wrapping up the map of some of my favorite Africans!
