Baroka has confirmed that they have parted ways with Doctor Khumalo to end speculation on the future of the Bafana Bafana legend with the club. Khumalo joined Baroka as the technical director at the start of the 2017/18 season, but was late roped in as the caretaker coach following the removal of MacDonald Makhubedu from the position. The Kaizer Chiefs legend has been linked with a return to Naturena and told reporters after helping Bakgaga avoid relegation that his door will always be open for Amakhosi. Khumalo has held different positions at Chiefs since hanging his boots as a player. Baroka chairman Khurishi Mphahlele recently told the media that the club's new coach Wedson Nyirenda has never worked with a technical director before, which put Khumalo's future with the club in doubt. Nyirenda was earlier this month announced as Baroka coach after leaving his position as the Zambia national team coach. A statement from Baroka said: "After months of speculation Doctor Khumalo and Baroka FC have finally agreed to go separate ways. "As Baroka Football Club, we will like to wish Doctor Khumalo well in his future endeavours." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
