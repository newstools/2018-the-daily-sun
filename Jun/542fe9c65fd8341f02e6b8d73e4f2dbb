THE table was filled with expensive booze. The women were dressed to kill, sporting revealing and stunning outfits. But a video circulating on social media shows the four slay queens a little worried about the bill. And it’s a bill to be worried about! It was a whopping R37 340, clearly the result of a great evening with way too much booze for the four women to drink. The video only started making the rounds on social media recently but it was taken on 27 May at Zero13 Lifestyle Club in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. One of the women is heard asking “Are you aware of the bill?” Another one has a look of concern on her face, while a third holds a cider bottle, seemingly unaware of the amount. The most expensive item was a bottle of champagne which cost R25 200. There was also a bottle of Glenfiddich at R3 200, Hennessy brandy for R1 000 and about R5 000 worth of ciders. At the end of the video, a voice is heard screaming: “I still need to pay the bill!” On Facebook, Tshepo Mompati Molawa said: “I imagine washing the dishes at the club can’t save you from this situation, neh?” Kgomotso Mathe said: “I don’t regret staying indoors on weekends.” Nomvelo Ntinga said: “I wish I was their waitress!” Sipho Mapala, the club’s co-owner, told Daily Sun the bill was paid. “To my knowledge, there was no issue of someone leaving the bill unpaid. It was handed over to the client and paid,” he said.
