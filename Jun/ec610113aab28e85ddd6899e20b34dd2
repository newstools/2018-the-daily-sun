President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the G7 Outreach
Summit as successful, signaling that it could boost the economy. The 44th G7 Summit was held in Quebec, Canada on 8 and 9
June. The theme of the summit was “Healthy, Productive and
Resilient Oceans and Seas, Coasts and Communities.” Ramaphosa was accompanied by Environmental Affairs
minister Edna Molewa and a business delegation from Mzansi. The president has said that the interest showed by the global
business community demonstrates a period of renewal and rebuilding. Amongst the things Ramaphosa shared at the summit
was Mzansi ’s strategy to research and develop alternatives and substitutes for
single-use plastics. “These actions by South Africa are complemented with
cooperative strategies to expand marine protected areas, address over-exploitation
through Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fisheries detection and enforcement
and supported by an integrated, shared ocean information system as a basis for
the sustainable management of the oceans and its users,” Ramaphosa said. He also met with heads of state and governments
from countries like Norway, France, Germany, Vietname, Kenya and the host
country, Canada. The presidency also said that Ramaphosa was confident
that preserving and opening up the ocean economy could create approximately 2
million jobs in fields like shipbuilding, sea transportation, aquaculture and
exploration of oil and gas.
