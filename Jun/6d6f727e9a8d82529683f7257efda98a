THIS cruel man will rot in jail. Xolani Lantu (36) was sentenced to three life sentences on two counts of rape and murder by Judge Derek Wille in the Western Cape High Court yesterday. Another five years were added for the kidnapping of five-year-old Minentle Lekhatha in June last year. Delivering his sentence, Wille acknowledged the national outcry from citizens to civil organisations about rape and murder. “We must send a strong message that there is no room for criminals.” The judge said Lantu had broken the trust the child had in him, because Minentle used to call him “Chommie”. The judge also said there was no explanation that could justify the senseless killing of the five-year-old girl. Lantu earlier this year confessed to having killed and raped Minentle. Lantu’s lawyer tried to argue for a lighter sentence, saying that his client had admitted to the crimes he had done and had co-operated fully with police. Lantu will serve his sentences concurrently, meaning he will be eligible for parole only after 25 years in prison. Siyabonga Makaula, chairman of the community policing forum, welcomed the sentence. “The law really played its part in making sure that this man gets to spend time in jail.” Xolani Diniso, chairman of ward 86, thanked the community for standing with the victim’s family throughout the court case. “The pressure that you gave the high court judge to give the above sentence proves how much this community cares about the safety of our children, who are the future leaders of this community,” said Diniso. Lantu had already spent a year in prison while waiting for sentencing.
