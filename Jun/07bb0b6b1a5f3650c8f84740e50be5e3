THIS organisation wants to help plus-sized women who are still ashamed of their bodies. Members of the I Heart Plus Size organisation in Limpopo said they suffered sexual abuse while others were bullied because of their chubby bodies. They said they do not take kindly to statements that suggest plus-size women are only good for a winter fling. On Saturday, the organisation held a lingerie party at Essence Premium Lifestyle in Polokwane. Maphefo Mabapa, the organisation’s president and founder, said standing up for plus-size women was not enough, so they decided to raise awareness about women abuse. “Since we started our organisation in September, we have changed the lives of many abused women. “We want more people to join us but they must be between size 42 and 50 and tell a story that will change lives,” she said. Maphefo said the group is working with African designers to open a plus-size boutique in the province. “The boutique will cater for women and plus-size children. “We struggle whenever we look for new clothes. “We are not sick. “We have accepted our bodies. “Lots of people have called us to perform in shows in their areas.” Nthabiseng Manamela, an activist who campaigns against the bullying of plus-size people, said the group is planning to adopt kids and help them understand that it is okay to be fat. She said they want to give plus-size kids the courage to be confident. Nthabiseng said the organisation also wants to teach children not to allow anyone to bully them because of their weight.
