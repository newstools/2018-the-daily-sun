MZANSI women are under siege. They are being murdered by the very people who are supposed to be protecting them. The recent spate of killings has angered political organisations. The IFP Women’s Brigade in Gauteng yesterday became the latest organisation to condemn the violence. Deputy national chairwoman Nonhlanhla Makhuba said: “We are deeply concerned. Despite our country having legislation that guarantees the rights of all, including women, these rights do not translate into the lives of women who still face systemic and endemic forms of violence.” She said the death of Sheila Kopanye, who was recently stabbed and killed allegedly by her ex-boyfriend in Mabopane, and the murder of Nomsa Maduna, who was gunned down by her former lover in Mofolo, Soweto, served as proof that women’s lives are under siege. “Gender-based violence is a serious issue that needs to be addressed once and for all. “To find a solution to this problem we first need to establish the root causes,” she said. “South African men believe that women are their property and that their loss is a threat to their patriarchal masculinity. “We hope that justice will be served in the cases of Kopanye, Maduna and other similar cases.” On Sunday, EFF leader Julius Malema also lashed out at men who kill women. He said that men have declared war on women in the country. Malema said men were killing women for something as petty as cheating.
