THE Mpumalanga government is putting the safety of patients and health workers first. Armed guards will be sent to all its hospitals and clinics. This comes after a number of attacks and robberies were reported at health centres. Joseph Mabuza, a spokesman for community safety, said the latest incident happened at Mapulaneng Hospital last month. “A doctor was nearly shot by robbers,” he said. On Monday, Health MEC Gillion Mashego, Finance MEC Eric Kholwane and Community Safety MEC Pat Ngomane met to talk about ways to improve safety at provincial hospitals and clinics. Mabuza said armed guards would be sent to ensure the safety of the people, including patients, doctors and nurses. “There has always been security guards at hospitals and clinics, but they were not armed as these areas are regarded as gun-free zones,” said Mabuza. “The decision to issue firearms to guards was then taken so that the public, including nurses and doctors, can be safe.”
