FIVE months after she was raped, cops had still not caught her rapist. So the 35-year-old woman from Tshepisong near Kagiso, Mogale City, tracked the man down herself. It took her only one week to do what the cops couldn’t achieve in almost half a year. Last Monday she went back to the spot where she was raped in January. She kept going back to the scene until Thursday, when she found a piece of paper with a typed address on it. When she went to the address, she saw the man who raped her. She led cops to the house in Tshepisong and her rapist was arrested. Police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya said: “The complainant claims she was on her way home when the suspect approached her. The suspect grabbed her and demanded she leave with him. “When she refused, he produced a firearm and threatened to shoot her. “The suspect dragged her to an open space between the local high school and the community hall. Then he raped her. “When the suspect was done, he assaulted the woman and took her handbag, which had her phone, bank card, ID book and cash.” Sibiya said an investigation was launched after the woman opened a case at Kagiso Police Station. He said the suspect made a brief appearance in the Kagiso Magistrates Court on Monday. The suspect was kept in custody for further investigations and a formal bail application.
