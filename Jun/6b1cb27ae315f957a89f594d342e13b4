PREMIER Soccer League chairman Irvin Khoza has honoured General Bantu Holomisa for his contribution to the country, which Khoza says has gone unreported. In honouring the politician and Zodwa Zwane at the PSL Awards, Khoza revealed the historic role of Holomisa in the development of the sport. Holomisa and Zwane were recipients of the annual Chairman’s Award. Said Khoza: “The Chairman’s Award celebrates the achievements and good deeds of people in our society. “For 2018, this award goes to two people who have made a special contribution to our lives and also our football. “The history of General Holomisa and his contribution to this country has not yet been told. “He is a man who is passionate about football but that is not a new thing. General Holomisa was among the people who backed us many years ago while he was chairman of Tembu Royals FC (in Mthatha). “Zwane was by Mama Winnie Mandela’s side and took care of Mama Winnie. “We just want to say thank you for looking after our icon and being there for her. “Winnie Mandela has a special place in our history. Through her deeds, Zodwa demonstrated what it means to be a Christian, not in name only.”
