Kwaito star Mshoza is picking up the pieces after another failed relationship. The star has been through many ups and downs in her career and her love life has not fared any better. After not having much luck in her previous relationships, Mshoza went into her most recent marriage determined to make it work. Speaking to Azania Mosaka on Real Talk, the Kortes hit-maker revealed that she made sacrifices in order to give her marriage the best possible chance to succeed. Recent events, however, suggest all those sacrifices were in vain. "This is what I told myself: 'I am not going to get divorced again,” she said, “I am going to fight for this. “I changed my lifestyle, I am not going to say I am a cheese girl, I am not going to brag, but I grew up very nice, I have driven beautiful cars. “Changing from that to something lower than that means I was trying my level best to make it work. At the same time, I realised I was killing myself instead." The past few months have not been the best for Mshoza, she even had to go into hiding after things reached boiling point with her estranged husband. However, the muso is looking to put all of the drama behind her and get back to her music.
