A COP secretly filmed two dealers frantically stuffing
their illegal drugs down the loo just before other officers bust through the
bathroom door. According to Coconuts,
Nopparat Jaikamleu (31) and Anusorn Jampol (37) were caught on Saturday in a
cop operation in Muang district, north of Bangkok in Thailand. They were bust with nearly 11 000 “yaba” tablets. Yaba is
the local name for methamphetamine tablets (known in Mzansi as Tik, Chrystal
meth or speed). They have been charged with possession of Category 1
drugs with intent to sell, using drugs, as well as illegal possession of
firearms.
