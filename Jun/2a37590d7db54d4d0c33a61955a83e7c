THANKS to a good Samaritan, the Tyhalani family will be able to identify the burned remains of their kids for burial. After five kids died in a shack fire at Mesiya squatter camp in Philippi, Cape Town at the beginning of the month, the family were told they needed to pay for DNA tests. Lindiwe Falteni, the mum of one of the victims, said businessman Tony Soares donated money after the family’s story was published in Daily Sun. “We could not make funeral arrangements without the DNA tests,” said Lindiwe. Soares, the manager of Green Planet Laundry, asked the SunTeam to take him to the family’s home. “No one has to go through what this family is going through,” he said. “That is why we decided to help them.” On top of donating R4 700 for the DNA tests, Soares said he would also help to install a fire alarm in the area. “I am going to buy a light that senses smoke and rings loudly, so everyone will know when there is a fire,” he said. Lindiwe said she was grateful to the residents for responding when she screamed for help, even though it was too late to save the children from the fire. “We cannot blame the residents. It is dangerous to just go out at night,” she said. “If Daily Sun did not publish our story, we would not have received help from Mr Soares,” Lindiwe said. “He should continue helping people in the communities.” The family said the municipality would help pay for the kids’ burial. The children will be buried in Eastern Cape on Saturday.
