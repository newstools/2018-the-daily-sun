YOU would be forgiven for thinking it is a competition for the funniest football club names. But there is much more than creative team names to the clubs that will be entertaining crowds at the Alfred Maimane Phiri (MAP) Games’ senior and masters tournaments starting this weekend. With the junior category finals done and dusted, the focus now shifts to the seniors, where teams such as Sheikh United, Black Poison, Ezimnandi and Ama 10-10 take centre stage. The draw for the Last 32 fixtures was conducted early this week and the games begin at the Rotary Grounds in Alexandra on Saturday and end on 22 July. The masters games will bring the curtain down on what is bound to be another successful MAP Games, with the oldies getting out of their comfort zone to put their money where their mouth is. Winners stand to win a cool R175 000, the runners-up R95 000 and the third-placed team pockets R30 000. “Now the senior and masters events roll around. There is good prize money at stake and we are expecting a tough competition this year,” said MAP Games founder and CEO Maimane Phiri. “We are grateful to our sponsors and partners who helped us put this tournament together. The round of 32 games start on Saturday and the event culminates in the final on 22 July.” Phiri started the MAP Games with only four teams as his social responsibility project nearly two decades ago. This year, a total of 160 teams are participating. The tournament has grown significantly and nowadays attracts many teams from across the country.
