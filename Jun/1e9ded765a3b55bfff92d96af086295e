THE wife of the 72-year-old Ismail Bassa who was killed in the Malmesbury
Mosque attack, says her husband of more than 30 years was
"slaughtered" as he prayed. Zainab Bassa told AFP that her husband talked to everybody
and he loved kids. "It's a great loss for me, as well as for the
community, for him to pass away in a masjid, murdered and slaughtered," she
said. "That was his second house - you would always find him
in the mosque. He left last night and said 'I'm going now, I'll buy you another
Eid dress'." Two worshippers were killed and others wounded in the stabbing
attack at the mosque, situated in Malmesbury in the Western Cape. The alleged attacker was later shot dead by the police. Two other people were wounded and are being treated in
hospital. The Cape SA Jewish Board of Deputies and Jewish community
condemned the shocking incident. "There can be no justification whatsoever for the loss
of life at a place of worship, in this manner." "We pray for the two victims and their families, and
call on all communities to redouble efforts to defeat the evils of hate for
good. Mosques, churches, temples, synagogues and all places of worship are
sacrosanct and must be places of safety,' the Cape SA Jewish Board of Deputies said. The police including the bomb squad and forensics, have
combed the scene following the killing of two the worshippers at the mosque.
