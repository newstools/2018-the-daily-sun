EVER since he was a young boy, Nsimbi Mabaso dreamt of one day living in a double- storey house. He liked the idea of sitting high above and looking over neighbours’ houses. And today that’s exactly what Nsimbi is able to do from the top of his double-storey kasi shack! The 41-year-old from Quarry Heights in Durban built his own two-storey shack using boards, wood and old glass. Nsimbi told Daily Sun he didn’t spend a cent when building his dream house. He collected material from the streets. After three months of collecting, he started building his two- storey shack in 2009. It took him seven months to complete. He said heavy winds and storms came and many shacks were blown away. But his 14-roomed mkhukhu, which includes a toilet, stands strong. “The reason my house is never affected by storms is because I took my time when building it. I built it with love. It’s my dream house.” He said a lot of people were fascinated by his shack and always ask him how he built such a big, strong mkhukhu. “I always tell them it’s because I fell in love with big houses at a young age.” He said because many people love his shack, he decided to rent out the eight rooms. “People who rent here feel safe because they know how strong these shacks are.” He said his room, which is on the top floor, has furniture and everything he needs. “I really enjoy sleeping at the top,” he said. “I get to see everything and everyone. “The view of this area is beautiful. “It may not be a fancy house but I love it. “The fact that I made it myself makes me proud.”
