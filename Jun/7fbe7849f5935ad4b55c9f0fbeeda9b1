THE ANC lost two stalwarts this week with the passing of Billy Modise and Joyce Mashamba. Billy Modise (87), who served as chief of state protocol from 1999 to 2006, and as Mzansi’s high commissioner to Canada in 1995, died on Wednesday after a long illness. Yesterday, President Cyril Ramaphosa said: “Our country and our people have suffered a great loss in the passing of ambassador Billy Modise.” He said Modise was a distinguished gentleman and leader of the people. The Gauteng ANC said they dip their revolutionary banners as they mourn the death of Modise. The Kathrada Foundation thanked him for forwarding the anti-apartheid movement internationally. Bantu Holomisa said: “Rest In Peace. He was an officer and a gentleman. He had a good innings.” Cecilia Julin, Swedish ambassador to South Africa, said: “A gentleman with great integrity that deserves all our respect.” “Comrade Joyce died at a time when the people of the province are yearning for leadership,” said Mathabatha. “Her counsel and wisdom in both government and society will be sorely missed.” The Speaker of the Limpopo Legislature, Polly Boshielo, said members of the legislature were saddened by her death. “The loss is even greater for her husband George Mashamba, who’s also a selfless leader in his own right.” National ANC spokesman Pule Mabe said the ruling party learnt with deep sadness of her passing. “She had been a loyal member who served with passion and dedication.”
