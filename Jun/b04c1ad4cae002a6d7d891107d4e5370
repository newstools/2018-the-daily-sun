THE open space was at first reserved for the construction of a primary school. But nothing happened for years and local boys took the opportunity to use it as a soccer field. But this situation has made Amos Masombuka very unhappy! The 58-year-old from Mountain View in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, said soccer balls kept on smashing through the windows of his house. He said since the boys started playing football, he had replaced broken glass more than 10 times. He said he’d tried to ask the boys to be more careful, but they wouldn’t listen. “Ever since the boys started using this area as a playground, I’ve not been living in peace,” he said. “The last time I had to buy glass was last week and I’m sick and tired of this. “I’ve tried many times to engage the local councillor and chief to stop the boys from damaging my windows, but nothing has happened.” Amos said he wasn’t against kids playing soccer as it kept them away from crime, but it was costing him money. Councillor James Msiza said he had a meeting with Amos last week, and they were planning to raise funds for a tall fence between his house and field. Chief Johannes Masimula agreed with the councillor, saying a fence would be the best solution. He said there were also other open spaces the boys could use.
