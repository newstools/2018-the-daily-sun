WHEN Zodwa Mathibela’s dream of becoming a social worker was shattered after losing her sight in 2007, she did not give up. Blind Zodwa (45) from Leratong Village near Kwa-mhlanga in Mpumalanga, takes care of poor children in her community, giving them food parcels and clothes. She said after losing her sight she thought it was all over, but picked up the pieces in 2012 and started Mpumelelo Children’s Home, where she is the director. Now Zodwa feeds and dresses 55 poor children from 27 households. She told Daily Sun she works with five other women from her area. She said she asks for donations from business people and churches to change poor people’s lives. “When I completed matric, the plan was to become a social worker, but fate caught up with me when I went blind in 2007. “I thought it was all over but the intuition in me drove me to carry on with my dream. All I wanted was to help needy people. “So I had to pick up the pieces and do what I always wanted to do. Even though I am not a social worker, I am satisfied with what I am doing right now.” Zodwa has since turned her three-room house and garage into a centre where poor children will soon be able to visit to get food. “I could not just sit at home and pity myself waiting for a disability grant. “This winter I am cooking soup for the kids. “ God helps me in everything I do and I know I will go far. “Many children wake up and go to school on empty stomachs and I know how it feels. I help kids up to 18 years, when they are able to stand up for themselves.” Zodwa said after becoming blind she joined the SA National Council for the Blind. She said they inspired her and made her believe everything is possible in life.
