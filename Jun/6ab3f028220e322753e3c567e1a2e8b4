BAD luck seems to be following the family of late maskandi artist Sibongiseni “Mjikijelwa” Ngubane. Just days after his funeral on Saturday, his cousin Mthobisi died in a car accident. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the 25-year-old’s black Golf GTI was involved in a head-on collision with a taxi on Tuesday. Both vehicles went up in flames. Zwane said the three people in the Golf died, as well as two taxi passengers, while 12 seriously injured people were rushed to hospital. Soon after the accident, people claimed on social media Mjikijelwa’s brother had died, but his brother Mnikezwa confirmed to Daily Sun that it was, in fact, his cousin who had died. Mnikezwa said he was one of the first people to arrive at the accident scene on the R612 between Dalton and Bhamshela in KZN. He said when he arrived, his cousin’s car was in flames, but cops said there was nothing they could do as he was already dead. “My cousin was in the car with schoolboys he had given a lift, and all of them died. We’re still shocked as to why death is stalking us. “Just days ago we buried my brother, and now we’re preparing for my cousin’s burial.” Earlier this year, Mjikijelwa’s kid was in a car accident and another died of natural causes.
