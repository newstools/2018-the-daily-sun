LINDIWE Mpfuom came to Mzansi over six years ago in search of greener pastures. Lindiwe, who was born in Zimbabwe 27 years ago, told Daily Sun she made the right call. Lindiwe from Zwelihle in Hermanus in the Boland, Western Cape, runs a small fast food business in her kasi. She sells pap and vleis with spinach. A place costs R40, and R35 without spinach. “When I arrived here six years ago, I knew I had to find a way to make money fast,” said Lindiwe. “I’m passionate about cooking healthy food, so I jumped into the catering business.” Lindiwe wakes up early every morning to prepare food for her many customers. “I take my business very seriously,” she said. “I want to give my customers what they want, when they want it.” She sells pap only for R10. “I meet all their needs because they’re the reason I’m able to feed my family,” she said. “My business is doing well, especially on weekends. I have many regular customers.” Lindiwe said most of her customers are single guys who buy food before they go out at night. “They don’t want to cook when they come home drunk.” Lonwabo Mkalipi (36) said he stopped cooking six years ago. “I live alone, so I just buy a plate from Lindiwe every day. I save a lot and I don’t have to worry about buying groceries and electricity. “I thank her every day for starting the business.” Nomsa Thandani (45) often knocks off late at work and is always tired. “I live with my husband. We order two plates regularly.”
