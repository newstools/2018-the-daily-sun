Mohale Motaung has finally released the video of his then boyfriend, now fiancé, Somizi Mhlongo proposing to him earlier this year. The couple was in Paris on a romantic getaway with a few of their friends at the time. After a couple of days frolicking in Paris, Somizi finally went down on one-knee during an evening under the stars. As seen on Somizi’s reality show, Living the Dream, Somizi had been planning the proposal for weeks prior to leaving South Africa with Mohale. In the now public video, Somizi is seen proposing to Mohale who becomes very emotional very quickly. “Somizi, you have made me the happiest man on earth,” Mohale said. Somizi, you have made me the happiest man on earth. #SomHale A post shared by  Mohale Tebogo Motaung (@mohale_77) on Jun 7, 2018 at 11:39am PDT
