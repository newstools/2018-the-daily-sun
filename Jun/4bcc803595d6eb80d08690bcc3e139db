THANDI Masango (49) lived in fear of her collapsing mud house and when lighting struck it, she thought it was safer to move into the shack she had been using as a kitchen. But that was a month ago and life has taken a turn for the better for Thandi. The excited mum of six girls from KwaLubisi, in Pongola, KZN couldn’t fight back the tears of joy when officials from uPhongolo Municipality, the Defence Force and local business people opened her house on Friday and handed her the keys. She told Daily Sun she moved into the shack because she didn’t have money to build another hut. “For 10 years we lived in a terrible house. I’m so grateful,” she said. Mayor Bawinile Nhlabathi said they heard about Thandi’s plight from the ward councillor who was notified by residents. “I thank everyone who has contributed to making this project a success,” she said.
