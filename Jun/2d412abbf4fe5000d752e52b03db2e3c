AN engineer sent to fix an ATM in Assam’s Tinsukia
district in north western India last Monday was gobsmacked when he discovered
the cash inside chewed, torn and now worthless. Among the shredded bank notes worth ?12.38 lakh (about
R25 million) lay the dead bodies of several mice, leading to the conclusion
that the little rodents and their friends must have destroyed the cash. According to The
Hindu, the ATM belonging to the State Bank of India had been topped up with
cash earlier on 19 May, but the next day it stopped working. Eventually an engineer was bought out from Kolkata, 1
500kms away, to fix the ATM, which is when the destroyed riches were discovered. The State Bank of India has lodged a complaint at Hijuguri
cop shop, although who or what they’re hoping to bust for the crime is not
clear. Officials recovered ?17.10 lakh (about R34 million) in
cash from the ATM that hadn’t been damaged.
