Local rapper L-tido has tried to play peacemaker in the feud between fellow rappers Cassper Nyovest and AKA. L-tido, real name Thato Madonsela squashed his beef with AKA a long time ago and the pair has even made a few songs together. The Steve Kekana hitmaker is now trying to get Cassper and AKA to smoke the peace pipe and end their beef as well. In a bet made with Cassper over a 5 on 5 basketball game, L-tido dared him to befriend AKA should he end up on the losing side. However, Cassper was not having it, staying true to what he said about there being no chance of reconciliation between himself and the Supa Mega. ICYMI: CASSPER AND AKA WILL ‘NEVER’ RECONCILE!
