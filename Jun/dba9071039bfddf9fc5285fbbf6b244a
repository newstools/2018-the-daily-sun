AS kids, these childhood friends would pretend to cook in their play kitchen. Today, they have their own fast food outlet. Andisa Rigala (25) and Aseza Noboba (25) own an outlet called Kasi Roadhouse at Pholile squatter camp in Lwandle, Strand. “We have always loved cooking and playing with food so we thought we should make money out of it, since we were both unemployed,” said Andisa. They speak highly of their food and their business as a whole. “Besides the food, our place is clean and neat. We often run specials and our customers love them,” said Andisa. Their business has been running for two years and Aseza said they would soon expand it. “We will be opening a second place close by where we will sell pizzas and gatsbys, a long sandwich filled with various ingredients,” said Aseza. Andisa said their biggest challenge was that their kasi had a poor electricity connection. “Sometimes the electricity just trips while we are cooking,” she said. She said they give food away whenever the electricity goes off so it doesn’t go to waste. Aseza’s advice to future business owners was that they should aim to impress customers. A customer Asibabale Mzotsho said her favourite meal was the kota with chicken livers. “I really like the way they make chicken livers. They are so delicious. “They are lovely people and you can tell they enjoy what they do,” said Asibabale.
