RELATIVES of Kamogelo Rapodile and her young daughter Bokamoso have been left devastated by their brutal murder. The 33-year-old mum and her four-year-old daughter were killed and burned beyond recognition, allegedly by Kamogelo’s boyfriend. The remains of the two were discovered on Saturday morning at the boyfriend’s home at Mina Nawe in Putfontein, Ekurhuleni. Kamogelo’s sister, Motshidisi Podile (26), said she knew the boyfriend was beating her sister. “We ignored the signs, hoping she would be OK,” said Motshidisi. The boyfriend allegedly killed Kamogelo and Bokamaso on Friday morning and then spent the day with their bodies in the house, as if nothing had happened. Kamogelo’s uncle, Themba Rapodile (54) said he was told by neighbours that the boyfriend was in and out of the house throughout Friday. “We went to the house after smoke was seen coming from it. He was standing there looking surprised, but he knew very well what he had done,” Themba said. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mack Mngomezulu said: “A man was arrested after his 34-year-old girlfriend and their four-year-old daughter were burned beyond recognition in the early hours of Saturday morning.” Mngomezulu said the police were called by neighbours after they had noticed flames coming from the premises. “We managed to track down and arrest the suspect. “He will appear in court today,” said Mngomezulu. The man is facing two charges of defeating the ends of justice and two of murder.
