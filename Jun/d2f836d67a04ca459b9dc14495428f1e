SMOKING is well known for its health risks. It cause lung diseases and cancer. The danger of smoking is even more dangerous for madala Edward Nchabeleng. The 78-year-old from Atteridgeville, in the west of Tshwane, always has a cigarette fixed to his mouth. And his love of smoking has nearly cost him his life – not once, but twice! In May, he was rescued from a burning shack while he was napping. This was after he had thrown a matchstick on the carpet. He escaped unharmed. He lost three blankets and a duvet in that fire. But the second fire, which broke out on Thursday, was severe. The madala was injured and lost everything he owned. His sister, Mantoa Tau (60), said they were fast asleep when they were woken up by his screams in the middle of the night. “We could only save him. Everything else was burnt,” she said. She said they were devastated but wanted to get him help. “He refused to go to hospital. I let him rest and decided I would take him to hospital in the morning but he woke me up in pain,” she said. She said they called an ambulance and he was rushed to hospital. “It’s been hard since he came back home from hospital. “He has no clothes, no bed and no documents. I hope a good Samaritan will come to our rescue,” she said.
