PATIENTS were seen making a quick dash for the door at Helen Joseph Hospital in Joburg yesterday. A bomb scare had sent patients, doctors, nurses and cleaners rushing outside. Even those in bed and wheelchairs were taken from the wards and waiting areas, while police raced to the scene. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele told Daily Sun the incident began when a doctor examining a mentally ill patient saw wires in the patient’s bag. “When the doctor checked thoroughly, he saw what looked like a grenade with batteries and wire. That’s when he thought it could be a bomb and called the police,” he said. Makhubele said hospital workers then instructed everyone to evacuate the building. “The bomb squad and the police arrived and it was only then that it was established it was not a bomb,” he said. One of the patients said: “I came in sick, hoping to be healed. When I heard there was a bomb, I just thought death really wanted me. It could not take me with sickness and now it wanted to blow me away.” Another patient said: “I am very sick and can’t walk properly, but when they said there was a bomb I was the first out the door.”
