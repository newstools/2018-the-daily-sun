AMAZULU started their preparation for the 2018-19 season with Siyabonga “Bhele” Nomvethe and Mabhuti Khenyeza still in their ensemble, a good sign that they may continue playing for the side. There have been rumours that the ageing duo could be let go by the club, but indications are that head coach Cavin Johnson is still assessing them further after Monday’s pre-season assembly. The Howick-born Khenyeza turned 36 on Sunday while Nomvethe, from KwaMashu, will turn 41 in December. The other player expected to return to the club is Orlando Pirates defender Thembela Sikhakhane who spent the past season on loan at Usuthu and the Durban outfit is said to be working hard to secure his services permanently. Johnson confirmed that everyone was in camp and in good shape “and ready to get going”. He said: “I just hope this season things will be better than the last. At least this time around I’ve started with the boys and I hope we will all have a better understanding of each other. Also I hope that players will come to the party for the benefit of the club.” AmaZulu will unfortunately have to watch the MTN8 competition from a distance after being kicked out of their top eight position by arbitration decisions that involved Ajax Cape Town, the PSL and Tendai Ndoro. Club spokesman, Briliant Mkhathini, said Sikhakhane did not report to camp on Monday but was due to join the rest of the team yesterday. Meanwhile, Johnson was cagey when asked about his interest on Kaizer Chiefs reject Sibusiso Khumalo. “No team reveals their interests at this time of the season,” explains Johnson. “Yes, he is a free agent but I can’t say anything. Let’s just wait and see. He is a good player. I gave him a platform to express himself while I was still at SuperSport United.”
