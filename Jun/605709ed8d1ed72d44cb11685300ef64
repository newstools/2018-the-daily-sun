FARMER Johannes Mashishi was boiling with rage when he discovered thugs had slaughtered another one of his cows. Last week, the 62-year-old from Bergenik Village, Polokwane found one of his cows bound at the feet. Most of its body parts were missing. The madala said this was the 10th cow he has lost. Three of his cows were killed last month. “They are usually slaughtered at the end of the month. “The timing suggests criminals are selling the meat to local butcheries,” he said. Johannes said he is worried the stolen meat might make people sick. “I just want those who are in the habit of buying stolen meat to know their health is in danger. The medication farmers inject into their cattle when seasons change is poisonous to humans. People must stop buying meat from thieves.” Johannes said he has opened a lot of cases but none of the thieves have been found. “I want the suspects to be arrested. This has got out of hand. “I don’t know what to do anymore because I patrol the area at night but I never see the criminals.” Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a case of stock theft was opened. He said: “No one has been arrested at the moment. We are pleading with anyone with information to contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.”
