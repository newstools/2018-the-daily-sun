THUGS are hijacking the genuine concerns of communities. This was the warning from Gauteng Human Settlements, Traditional Affairs and Co-operative Governance MEC Dikgang Moiloa during his visit in Eersterust, Tshwane. He was visiting the family of Arthur Moses to convey condolences on behalf of the government. The 60-year-old Arthur died last Wednesday. He was overcome by tear gas fumes which he inhaled when police were trying to disperse protesters. Moiloa said Eersterust was known as a peaceful community and the residents’ protest was justified. He said no protest should lead to a person’s death. The MEC said thugs had infiltrated genuine protests and police were only trying to disperse the crowd. Moiloa said Arthur’s death was not in vain and would be used as a platform to address issues raised by the community. He advised the family to report the case to Ipid. The victim’s brother Cecil (55) told Daily Sun Arthur died while watching protesters from his home. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said 18 people were arrested since the protest started. She said police had not yet recovered the firearm stolen from Eersterust Police Station. It happened when angry protesters stormed the cop shop.
