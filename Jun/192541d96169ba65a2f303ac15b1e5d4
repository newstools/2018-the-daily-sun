The parents of Hlulani Mkhavele (6) are appealing to good
Samaritans across Mzansi to help their needy family. Their son Hlulani was born disabled in Malamulele Hospital in 2012 and
is unable to go to school because he doesn't have one leg and a birth certificate. They pleaded for a wheelchair for their son. His parents are also homeless and have now been given a temporary shelter in a shack by one good Samaritan who has seen their plight. His father Aton Mkhavele (31) told Daily Sun that he is
originally from Mozambique and was forced to move to Mzansi by poverty and lack
of job opportunities back home. He said his boy has become a laughing stock to other children when they see
his disability. Mkhavele said added that he was relieved when a local
headman in section F in GiyaniÂ promised to give him a piece of land if anyone was willing to assist
with the shelter. The boy's mother Maria Vutuli (23), said that another
problem is that they are both undocumented, which led to their two kids also
having no birth certificates. Maria said she will welcome any assistance by anyone who
is willing to help the family.
