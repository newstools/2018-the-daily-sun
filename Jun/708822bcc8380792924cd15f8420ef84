THE airport in Port Elizabeth is known as an international one, but it gets no flights from outside SA. Since it was upgraded to an international airport in 2012, it has been struggling to attract airlines from other countries. However, this is about to change as the Airports Company of South Africa, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality and the municipal tourism board have signed a memorandum of understanding to improve air service connectivity. Nelson Mandela Bay Tourism CEO Mandlakazi Skefile, municipal business chamber CEO Nomkhita Mona, mayor Athol Trollip and airport company’s executive of business development Charles Shilowa signed the memorandum at the Port Elizabeth City Hall yesterday. Trollip said: “This memorandum will assist with facilitating the city’s growth. “This plan will support the economic growth of the region and enable the movement of people, goods and services.” MMC for tourism and economic development Andrew Whitfield said the project would have three phases. These would include the identification of potential airline partners, research and development and a three-year implementation plan to establish new routes to link the airport to others. “The Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber and Nelson Mandela Bay Tourism, as critical and key stakeholders to this agreement, will play an integral and pivotal role in the implementation of phase two and three of the air lift strategy. “We also hope to have more and direct private sector participation in the programme,” he said.
