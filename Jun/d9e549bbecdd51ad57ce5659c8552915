EMBALENHLE was a no-go area yesterday. Angry residents of the kasi in Secunda, Mpumalanga shut it down in the early hours of the morning. They were angry about disruptions to the power supply caused by the fact that Govan Mbeki Municipality owes Eskom millions of rands. Residents said they were gatvol of suffering because of the municipality’s failure to pay its bills. They barricaded all roads leading in and out of the area with stones and burning tyres. Businesses and schools were forced to close. Councillor Douglas Mahlangu told Daily Sun residents had held a meeting at the local stadium and were unhappy about the delivery of electricity, water and other services. “If the municipality cannot provide electricity reliably, we would rather surrender it back to Eskom,” he said. The municipality allegedly has contracts with three companies to supply electricity to the area. Mahlangu said they weren’t told why the municipality was not providing electricity and why a contract was given to outside companies. “If the municipality is failing, why can’t they place it under administration so it can become more effective?” he asked. Gogo Rose Mabuza (75) said for the past 20 years there had been problems with the sewerage system. Last week, Eskom issued a warning to residents about unplanned power cuts. The municipality owes the power utility R900 million. Municipal spokesman Bheki Kubheka said the matter was very complex and he couldn’t comment. He said the mayor would release a statement soon.
