“ALBINISM is a condition, not a lucky charm.” This was what residents were told at an awareness campaign held in Kabokweni, Mpumalanga, on Friday. It was organised after 13-year-old Gabisile Shabani was murdered earlier this year and thugs stole body parts from the grave of Xolani Mkhize. Gabisile and Xolani were living with albinism and it is suspected their body parts were used for muthi. Gladys Nkosi, deputy chairwoman of the Mbombela Albinism Support Group, said people with albinism should be treated like everyone else. “I’ve been called names and mocked about this condition. People need to understand the only difference between us and them is the colour of our skin.” Gladys said people with albinism usually had eye problems and sensitive skin. “We are not animals and sangomas should stop killing us, thinking their muthi will be stronger,” she said. Lizzy Nyalungu, Mbombela’s strategic management services MMC, said they organised the event to educate residents. “There are so many superstitions about albinos and we need to put an end to this.” Provincial chairman of the Traditional Healers’ Association Fanie Mashaba told Daily Sun people killing those with albinism for muthi were not real healers. He said healers had to ensure people felt safe. “We encourage them to invite us to their gatherings so we can offer support and explain how real healers operate.”
