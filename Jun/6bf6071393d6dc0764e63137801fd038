JOBURG mayor Herman Mashaba opened the revamped Golden Harvest Rehabilitation Centre in Northwold, Randburg, on Monday. Golden Harvest provides services to addicts who can’t afford to check into private rehabs. The centre started operating in 2011 and served as an in-patient facility that looked after 12 boys aged between 13 and 17. It has now been expanded to accommodate 58 addicts. “The services are being expanded to cater to male and female addicts,” said Mashaba. He said the facility offers a six week in-patient treatment programme that includes medical and psychosocial treatment. “According to the South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, the centre provided rehabilitation services to 144 teenage boys between April last year and March,” he told the People’s Paper “The majority of admissions were children aged between 16 and 17. They accounted for 65% of all admissions.” He said 24 youths were admitted for smoking marijuana while another 15 checked in for nyaope addiction. Twelve went to the centre for either chrystal meth, Khat or mandrax addiction.
