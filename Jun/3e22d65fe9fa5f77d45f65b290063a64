SANCO in Khayelitsha has called on schools to hire well-trained security guards. This follows a wave of attacks by thugs at several schools in the kasi. The call was made by the organisation’s leaders at Injongo Primary School on Sunday afternoon. They said in the past two months, several schools had been robbed and teachers’ cars hijacked. Welile Mdaka, their secretary, said if action was not taken pupils would start dropping out. He said some teachers were robbed in front of pupils, leaving them traumatised. “Some of the footage we’ve seen shows kids running for their lives,” said Mdaka. “We don’t want the department to use neighbourhood watches to look after schools. “We want the same security our MECs have at their offices.” Another leader, Jackson Bhozo, said the first attack happened at Ummangaliso Primary School on 16 May. They were shocked after three more attacks followed at other schools. “We want schools to have proper fencing,” said Bhozo. Meanwhile, Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schafer has offered a R10 000 reward to anyone who has information about the robberies.
