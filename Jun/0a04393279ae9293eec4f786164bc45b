COPS in KZN say they’re ready for the thousands of people expected to flock to Durban to support former president Jacob Zuma today. Zuma will appear in the Durban High Court to face 16 charges of corruption, fraud, racketeering and money laundering. eThekwini Metro police said yesterday that traffic management plans had been put in place to ensure motorists were not disturbed by activities taking place around the court. Zuma’s supporters, who will be led by church leaders and ANC provincial leaders, are expected to march from King Dinuzulu Park to the court down Pixley ka Seme Street. They began gathering in Albert Park in Durban for a night vigil last night. Cops said Margaret Mncadi Avenue would be closed from 8am until after peak traffic. Joseph Nduli and Joe Slovo streets would be closed until 1pm.
