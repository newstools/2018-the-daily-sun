MADALA Lazarus Malatjie never thought he would be the victim of road rage. He also never thought he would experience racism. But both nightmares came true when a road rage fight became a racist incident. The 57-year-old madala from Walkerville, in the Vaal, was viciously moered by two men in what he described as a racially charged attack. Speaking to Daily Sun, Lazarus said he was on his way from dropping off his cousin in Vanderbijlpark at about midnight on Sunday, driving along the R82. Suddenly his car was cut off by a white VW Golf. After a few verbal exchanges, Lazarus thought the quarrel was over. However, it raged on. He said the Golf started following him. Lazarus spotted a garage and pulled in there for safety. He stepped out of his car and asked for help, as he was still shaken by what had happened. Just then, the Golf drove up right behind him. He said before he knew it, the two men were on top of him. “They started beating me up all over my body,” he said. “As they were beating me up, one kept calling me ‘kaffir’.” “Were it not for the help of a bystander who called the cops, I would be dead,” he said. The madala said he felt degraded that he was assaulted by young men. His life was saved when the cops arrived. Police spokesman Captain Fikile Funda said a case of assault was opened. One suspect was arrested. He appeared in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court yesterday. Investigations are continuing.
