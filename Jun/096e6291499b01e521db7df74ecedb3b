JOY and relief were the order of the day in Hammanskraal and Mabopane, north of Tshwane yesterday as residents received their title deeds. The handover was done by Gauteng Premier David Makhura and MEC for Human Settlements, Traditional Affairs and Co-operative Governance, Dikgang “Uhuru” Moiloa. The handing over of the title deeds forms part of the Ntirhisano Outreach programme in Gauteng. Moila said they came to restore people’s dignity and make them formal property owners. Makhura said there were over 11 670 households that owed over R24 million in services but the Gauteng government had decided to pay their debts so that the houses could be transferred to them. Hundreds of people came to Odi Stadium in Mabopane to get what was due to them. Young and old came and sang happily as they were handed their title deeds. Makhura said the process of transferring homes to their rightful owners would be completed by August. He added that he was happy to be handing over the title deeds. Residents in the area had been affected negatively as they had formerly been part of North West province. “We are going to verify properly who the rightful beneficiaries are so that houses are not transferred to the wrongful owners.” Makhura said they had also started a programme called Rapid Land Release. “We will identify people who qualify for land to build their own homes. We will supply bulk infrastructure including drainage, water services and electricity,” he said. The programme is aimed at preventing land invasions. He said they wanted people to have land accompanied by title deeds showing they are the rightful owners. He asked residents to help the Gauteng government identify the rightful owners of the houses as they knew them. “We would also like to urge our people not to sell or rent out the houses once we have delivered the title deeds.”
