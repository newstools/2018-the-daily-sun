SHE struggled to stay dry in her old leaking mud house. But gogo Simphiwe Ndlovu’s plight became a big talking point when it was publicised on Facebook. People’s hearts were touched and, thanks to them, Simphiwe (83) will soon move into a new brick and mortar house. She’s one of the residents in Ncekwane, northern KZN, who recently told Daily Sun there was no development in Mzansi. She lives in a leaking mud house and fetches water far from home. Her photo was circulated on Facebook and people who commented were all saddened by her circumstances. Businesspeople apparently donated money and construction of her house started on Saturday. She said Umlalazi municipal officials visited her on Friday and thereafter told her businesspeople would build a house for her – and construction started the next day. “I felt as if I was dreaming,” said the gogo. “After so many years of suffering, I’m now a happy gogo. “I thought I was going to die in this mud house, but God made plans for me.” She thanked the SunTeamfor reporting on the struggles the people of Ncekwane face on a daily basis. Umlalazi spokesman Mkhuseli Buthelezi told the People’s Paper: “The municipality is planning to develop this area, but gogo was a priority.” Referring to the Good Samaritan businessmen, he said it’s a good thing that people still have giving hearts.
