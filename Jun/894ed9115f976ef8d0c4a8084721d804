COPS who pulled a car over for a broken brake light got
more than they bargained for when the eventual arrest of the driver led them to
a house of horrors. According to reports, the incident began last week in
Springfield, Massachusetts, when cops tried to pull over Steward Weldon (40).
Weldon put his foot down and the car chase with the cops only ended when he
crashed into a cop car and fought officers who tried to arrest him. In the car with him was a terrified 25-year-old woman who
sobbed as she thanked cops for saving her life. She said: “He's going to kill me," according to the
police report. She said she had been held against her will by Weldon for
the last month, raped by him and moered with a hammer. Her injuries included a possible fractured jaw and stab
wounds, cops said. Weldon appeared last week on charges of kidnapping,
threat to commit a crime, carrying a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest. But three days later, things really got crazy when
Weldon’s mum called the cops to report a “foul smell” in the house they shared. There cops discovered the bodies of three local women who
had been reported missing over the last months.They have since been identified as Ernestine Ryans (47), America Lyden (34) and
Kayla Escalante (27). Their heartbroken families have since been informed. Weldon has not been charged with their deaths pending an
investigation, but authorities are saying they are "suspicious at the very
least". Following last week’s court appearance, a second woman
reportedly came forward with allegations that Weldon had kidnapped her in
February. He appeared in court yesterday again on kidnapping,
assault and rape charges in relation to the second woman’s claims. Weldon pleaded not guilty and is expected back in court on
29 June.
