THE South African Human Rights Commission’s inquiry into the
Charlotte Maxeke protests is currently underway. SAHRC’s provincial manager, Buang Jones, last week announced
the commission. This follows the protest at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in
Joburg on 31 May. Protesters damaged hospital property and intimidated
patients, chasing them away. The Commission has summoned representatives from the Gauteng
Department of Health, NEHAWU, Charlotte Maxeke Hospital and the Gauteng SAPS. They are expected to submit oral representations of what
roles each of their respective institutions played in the protest. The HOD of the Gauteng Health Department, Dr Mkhululi
Lukhele was the first to submit his oral representation. Lukhele answered questions and alleged that the Department
did not have the R350 million that was to be set aside for performance bonuses. Lukhele said that not all workers deserve performance
bonuses. He mentioned that financial constraints were one of the
factors preventing the government from paying the bonuses. “It would be unfair if every health worker is paid an
incentive, and had full understanding, because some workers work hard beyond
the call of duty to deserve it, only to receive no incentive,” he said. The Commission is expected to her testimonies from the
Hospital’s CEO Dr Gladys Bogoshi, Gauteng Police Commissioner Deliwe De Lange
and NEHAWU provincial deputy secretary Gracia Rikhotso.
