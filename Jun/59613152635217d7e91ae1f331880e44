THE Safa national executive committee will on Sunday put together a 2023 and 2027 Women’s World Cup bid committee and a strategic committee to lead the association in its quest to host either of the two events. Safa president Danny Jordaan said this was of paramount importance for Safa considering that it would be launching a Women’s League next year consisting of 16 teams. Jordaan has called on Premier Soccer League clubs to move fast as there are only four slots left to conclude the list of 16. The 16-team league will include the nine provincial winners of the Sasol Women’s League, two existing clubs – Mamelodi Sundowns and Bloemfontein Celtic Ladies – and the University League winners. Jordaan said they had the appropriate infrastructure that were compliant to host major events like the World Cup. According to him, the fear is not acting swiftly enough to host this event, which comes with the Under-20 Women’s World Cup – another economic spin-off for the country. Said Jordaan: “The longer you take, the bigger the gap becomes between the best facilities and what you had a long time ago. “If you look at the USA, they hosted the men’s World Cup in 1984 and the Women’s World Cup in 1989 – five years later. Fifa understands that these people tick all the boxes. “Germany hosted the men’s World Cup in 2006 and the women’s event five years later in 2011. France took longer. “But now, once you get the Women’s World Cup, they give you the Under-20 Women’s World Cup automatically.” The same special meeting on Sunday, hosted while the Cosafa Cup is underway in Polokwane, will also look into deciding which country Safa plans to support and vote for to host the 2026 World Cup. The choices are between Morocco and a joint bid by the USA, Canada and Mexico.
