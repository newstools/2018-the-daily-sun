SICK children, sent to Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital – also known as the Joburg General – stay at the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital in Parktown. Kids with serious health problems stay at the children’s hospital with family for free. Dr Mandisa Maholwana, CEO of the children’s hospital, told SunWellbeing that the hospital directly contributes to Nelson Mandela’s dream of improving the quality of life for all Mzansi children. “Mandela said children are the lifeblood of our nation, which is why it is a priority to make sure they’re kept healthy and strong. “We make sure that their families are with them to give them support during some of the toughest times the kids will experience in their lives.” Dr Maholwana received a gift of a Toyota Quantum from Avis Rent a Car to transport their young patients between Charlotte Maxeke and the children’s hospital. Doreen Lupton, human capital executive at Avis, said that, to realise Mandela’s dream, the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital Trust started its fundraising in 2012. “On 18 July 2013, Avis handed over a small car to the children’s hospital to help boost their awareness drives and generate funds for the construction of the hospital. “But now that construction is over and the hospital is open, the Quantum bus will transport non-critical patients and their parents to and from Charlotte Maxeke. Maholwana said this donation will make a big difference and hopefully remind others who want to lend a helping hand to come forward. “We accept any kind of help, including donations and volunteers at the hospital in order to make sure there is access to quality healthcare for all.”
