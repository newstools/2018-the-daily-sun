KLOOF Mine has promised the families of dead miners they will receive financial relief above and beyond the regular employee benefits. Thabisile Phumo, a spokeswoman for Sibanye-Stillwater Kloof Mine in Westonaria, Gauteng, said they were worried about the high death rate. On Monday morning, five mineworkers were trapped underground after an accident. The mine said the miners entered an abandoned area at the Ikamva shaft. They said it was unclear who authorised this. But the unions, including NUM, dismissed this and said the shift boss was among those who were trapped. Since then, four miners have been retrieved and declared dead. One miner has still not been found. Phumo said the rescue team was working day and night, to search for the miner. She said the department of mineral resources will investigate. Phumo also called on the people involved with the mine to look into the safety of the current operation. She said they were talking to the families. “We’ll pay for funeral costs, help their children with education funds, and provide housing to those who don’t have houses,” said Phumo. She said the families would be provided with a grocery allowance until they could access the funds. “The company will apply the labour replacement policy,” she said. “They will nominate a family member to come and replace the deceased mineworker.” On Tuesday, Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa called for President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene. He said those responsible should be held to account.
