LIFE is hard for this gogo and her family. Gogo Funani Makhathini (94) lives with her late sister’s daughter, Sibongile (26), and three grandkids in a one-roomed mud house in Esikhaleni, northern KZN. What is even worse is that the daughter lives with a disability. Funani told Daily Sun she would be grateful if she could get an RDP and a wheelchair for her. She said that in March last year ward committee members visited her house. “They assessed our situation and promised to come back with answers on whether I qualify for an RDP or not. “But they never came back and we are still stuck in this mud house,” said gogo Funani. Gogo said she was worried she might die before getting a house for her family. “I am afraid that because of my age, I will die and leave my family in this crumbling house.” The gogo said she was also worried about Sibongile’s health, as well as her grandkids – Philasande (19), Sithandiwe (15) and Olwethu Makhathini (3). She told the People’s Paper they survived on her old age grant. “Life is hard for me and my family. I am worried that this house will one day fall on us,” she said. “I hope good Samaritans out there will help us build a decent home.” Mdu Ncalane, a spokesman for Umhlathuze Municipality, said they had not been aware of the gogo’s situation. “But I am still going to check with the municipality structures, including the ward committee.” Ncalane promised to check today.
