DJ Tira’s wife, Gugu Khathi, came under severe criticism on Twitter for what many described as “bad attitude” displayed at the South African Music Awards at the weekend. Gugu was spotted looking less than impressed by something that was said by the hosts during the awards giving a thumbs down, but what really rubbed many people the wrong way on Twitter was the “ bad attitude” she displayed on stage when she went to collect an award on Mafikizolo’s behalf. However, Mafikizolo’s Theo Kgosinkwe and Nhlanhla Nciza have come out in defence of Gugu saying she didn’t mean to disrespect anyone and that people just misinterpreted her demeanor. "We just want to clarify what happened last night with Gugu Khati's speech. Gugu is DJ Tira's wife we asked her at the last minute to go on stage and accept the award for us, and she was kind enough to do so. “I just want to say that Gugu is an amazing woman, she's a beautiful woman and she's part of the Mafikizolo family and she's been for years, she's a dear friend of mine as well," Nhlanhla said in a video posted on social media. "She was nervous about going on stage but also, people don't understand the way she speaks, even when we're chilling and we just talking and having fun, she would make the kind of facial expressions, and because we know that we don't take offense of what happened last night, because people don't know and they took it personally...we just want to assure the South Africans that she was not in any way being disrespectful to South Africans or to Mafikizolo, I hope this clears the air..." she added in another version of the video posted on her social media accounts but has since been deleted.
