A WOMAN who set fire to a tree to try and scare a snake away
saw flames when the tree fell down and killed her. According to Bulawayo24, Loveness Muchadakuenda (33) met
her fiery end on Monday in Mvurwi, northern Zimbabwe. Eyewitness Kelvin Kunze said Loveness had been working on
Vigira farm in the afternoon when a snake attacked her. She raised the alarm
and other farm workers rushed to her rescue. The snake is believed to have been the deadly black
mamba, common in the mountainous area. Kelvin said: “They attacked the snake and it fled and
climbed up a tree near the Loveness’ hut. This forced her to set the tree ablaze
to scare the snake away.” Early in the evening, Loveness felt sure the snake had
now disappeared and decided to extinguish the flames. “She went into her
hut to get a bucket of water to put out the fire. Just as she came out, the
tree, unfortunately, fell on her and she died instantly,” Kelvin said. Loveness’ body has been taken to Mvurwi mortuary, while
cops say they have yet to be informed about the case, said the report.
