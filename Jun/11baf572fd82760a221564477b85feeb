THERE were tears of joy, pain and excitement at the first Narcotics Anonymous imbizo in Soweto. Some speakers shared their experiences with drugs, while others talked about living a clean life. The event at Diepkloof Multi-Purpose Hall in Soweto on Saturday was attended by people from all classes, ages and races. A 38-year-old gay man from Eldorado Park who had been clean for three years said he realised he did not fit into society. “I was always reminded I was not one of them. The only way to find comfort was turning to drugs,” he said. “Today I am proud of being gay and I will never hide it.” He said the life he found through Narcotics Anonymous had given him dignity after being in hell for 13 years. “It is painful when you are discriminated against by those who are supposed to love you.” A man from Lenasia spoke about his addiction, which caused pain to his wife, kids and many others. “I enjoyed hurting others when I was high. I forced myself on my wife when I was high,” he said. “I did not even realise the kids were around to witness this sick deed. “I never thought there was a way out of this until I came into contact with Narcotics Anonymous.” One of the participants had been clean for 22 years and there were also some newcomers.
