A young woman recently told me that she switched her oral contraceptive pill, and subsequently suffered bad breakouts. Young women are forever going on the Pill to save their skin. Be it from teen or adult acne and breakouts, it has always been 'general knowledge' among women in particular that the Pill works for skin issues. But is this a myth? Many still believe that going on an oral contraceptive like the Pill will result in weight gain, for example. Stylecaster.com notes that this is a myth - "Generally, this perceived 'weight gain' is due to water retention, similar to the bloat you feel before and during your period. Furthermore, modern birth control pills contain much lower amounts of hormones than those that were available in the ’60s, which is probably when this rumour started."Dermatologists have been using birth control pills to treat acne in women for decades. However, "...most oral contraceptives (OCs) have not been specifically approved for the treatment of acne and only few OCs have actually been approved for treating acne," says dermatologist, Dr. Nomphelo Gantsho.  But there is compelling evidence that OCs are effective in the management of mild to moderate acne as the Pill decreases circulating androgens, which decreases the production of sebum and can decrease acne lesions."Acne is triggered by the excess production of sebum. Along with skin cells, sebum can clog pores and promote the growth of bacteria that contribute to acne," says Gantsho. For OCs to be effective in treating mild acne, they must contain oestrogen and low levels of progestin such as Diane, Yasmin, Yaz, Ginette, Marvelon (the common ones in South Africa). The minipill only contains progestin, so it doesn't improve acne. In fact, OCs that contain only progesterone can cause stronger androgenic effects and have the potential to exacerbate acne.
