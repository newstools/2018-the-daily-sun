THE area where Hastings Ndlovu and Hector Pieterson were killed by cops on June 16 1976 has become a tourist attraction. A short distance down the road are the houses of former president Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. Madala Eric Moralo (68) lives not far from where Hastings and Hector were shot by cops in Orlando West, Soweto. He said he still remembers how scared he was as a teenager when he heard singing and chanting pupils from the nearby Matseke High School. “After a while the police arrived and blocked the pupils from leaving the school yard,” he said. “The pupils forced their way out by breaking the gates. “Then the police released their dogs and that’s when all hell broke loose. “A police dog was stabbed to death and the cops went wild. “They started shooting at pupils who were throwing stones at police.” Eric said he saw a school boy being shot and others fleeing in all directions. “The boy later died while being carried by a young man who was trying to rush him to the clinic,” said Eric. “I later heard the boy was Hector.’ Eric said Hastings, who lived a few streets from his house, was also shot dead. Khama Seheri (56) said although he was a young boy, he remembered what he saw. “The police were aggressive. It was clear they were there for a fight,” said Khama. “Releasing the dogs was a sign of war.” Madala Moses Johannes (62) was a matric pupil at Matseke. “I remember two days before the tragic incident, our friends at nearby Phefeni Secondary School were planning to march. We also prepared placards and kept them in the classroom,” he said. “But on the day of the march the placards were missing. “On the day of the march the police were waiting outside the school gate. We forced our way out by breaking the gates. “Police released their dogs and one of the animals was stabbed to death. “The cops were angry and started shooting at pupils. We fled in all directions. We later heard that Hastings and Hector were killed.”
