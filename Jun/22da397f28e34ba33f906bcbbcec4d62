ILLEGAL  initiation schools have become such a problem that initiations have been suspended in the Vaal, Gauteng . Cops are now getting ready for the mushrooming of illegal bush schools as Gauteng  youths flock to other provinces for winter mountain schools. This time round, police and authorities are ready to avoid cat-and-mouse games in the bush and forests, with a big brother to help them. Government will roll out drones this month to spy on bogus, hidden bush schools  f  rom the sky. The decision comes after discussions at the launch of  the Eastern Cape winter initiation season earlier this month. Deputy Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Obed Bapela  told Daily Sun’s sister publicationCity Pressgovernment planned to hire the drones. Every district and local municipality will be able to use them during the season to spy o  n forests and mountain tops. Ba pela said drones would play a big role in monitoring areas cops couldn’t reach. “Also, a special chip can be put in every ibhoma and linked to an app we use to  detect where problems  are,” he said. “The drone definitely can spot activities the naked eye won’t be able to see. “Gauteng boys are flocking to other provinces, so we expect high numbers coming  to the Eastern Cape. “We warned Gauteng authorities when they suspended the practice that they were giving the Eastern Cape  a challenge. “When those boys come here, they don’t know which initiation schools are l egal.”
