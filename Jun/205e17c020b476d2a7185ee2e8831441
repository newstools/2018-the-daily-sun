ONE of the most sought after coaches in Africa, Herve Renard, will get another shot at proving his football leadership credentials when he leads Morocco to the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia, which starts on Thursday. The Atlas Lions will open their World Cup Group B account against Iran on Friday at the Zenit Arena, popularly known as the Saint Petersburg Stadium, on the western side of the city’s Krestovsky Island. Their second game is against Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal in Moscow on 20 June before they conclude the group stage against tough-as-teak Spain in Kaliningrad on 25 June. Speculation was rife last month that the 49-year-old Renard would quit as Morocco coach after the World Cup to take up the vacant post in Algeria, where he has allegedly been offered a five-year contract. But he has since denied the rumours. He was also linked to a Bafana Bafana job last year, but SunSport understands that he and Safa failed to reach an agreement on terms, leaving space for the appointment of Stuart Baxter. Renard, known for wearing a crisp white shirt for each match, has led Zambia and Ivory Coast to respective Africa Cup of Nations triumphs, making him a popular figure on the continent. The Atlas Lions played their last friendly before the Russia tournament against Estonia at the weekend, where Renard expressed his dissatisfaction with the performance of some of his players, a Moroccan newspaper reported. Despite his displeasure, Renard stressed that his team was ready for the World Cup – Morocco’s fifth World Cup appearance coming after a 20-year absence. The Moroccan national football team arrived in Russia on Sunday to start final preparations. Renard told his team’s official website: “I prefer to give a few players a chance. I am not satisfied with the performance of some.” Upon arriving in Voronezh, a city 446km south of Moscow, the Moroccan team was reportedly welcomed by the Moroccan ambassador to Russia Abdelkader Lachheb.
