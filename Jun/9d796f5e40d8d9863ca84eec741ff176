SHE went to pay condolences to her friend’s children, but her kindness led to her losing her life. Neighbours said they heard screams at about 9am from the house in Mapetla, Soweto on Tuesday. When they went to check they walked into a horror scene. While the woman was in the house, she was stabbed to death. The dead woman’s family arrived at the scene in time to watch as her body was taken away in a mortuary van. A neighbour told Daily Sun they were still coming to terms with the death of their neighbour, who died last Sunday. According to neighbours, at the time of her death, her 17-year-old son was apparently angry with his mother for trying to sell his father’s house. Moroka police spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza said that a 17-year-old boy was suspected of also killing the 44-year-old woman who came to pay her condolences to the family of her late friend in Mapetla. A case of murder has been opened and the police are looking for the suspect, who is on the run. The Moroka police appeal to anyone who has any information to phone 011 527 0000.
