GAUTENG Premier David Makhura has placed Emfuleni Municipality under administration. “Gauteng province will now have financial control over the municipality,” said Makhura yesterday at a media briefing in Joburg. Makhura spoke about plans for Emfuleni following the municipality’s serious financial, governance and service delivery difficulties over the past few past years. Since November 2015, the provincial treasury and co-operative governance department have been working with the municipality to provide institutional support in line with the Constitution. “Despite these efforts, the financial position of Emfuleni Municipality continues to deteriorate,” said Makhura. He said it was now at a point where the municipality, on its own, is not able to guarantee the provision of a minimum standard of services to communities. “What started as a financial problem has now become a problem of service delivery,” said Makhura. He said the situation required a more intense intervention. “The provincial executive council decided to institute a comprehensive intervention plan to ensure minimum standards of service delivery to communities and ensure financial viability through a financial recovery plan.” The premier will hold monthly meetings with the mayor, MECs and members of the mayoral committee to review progress on the intervention.
