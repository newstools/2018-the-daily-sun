COPS in Limpopo are fighting fire with fire. They have rounded up some more cash-in-transit suspects. One of the thugs was killed when the gang was cornered in Swadini, outside Hoedspruit, and five were arrested. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the bust came just hours after they robbed the cash van between Phalaborwa and Tzaneen on Tuesday evening. He said 10 suspects were involved in the heist that saw a G4S security van being blown up. The heavily armed robbers, who were travelling in two cars, apparently started shooting at the van’s wheels until it came to a stop. Mojapelo said the suspects ordered the three security officers out of the van at gunpoint before blasting it with explosives. “We managed to arrest five suspects and one was shot and killed during the shoot-out which ensued when they were cornered in Swadini. “The police were assisted by Farm Watch guards, who blocked the route. Another car belonging to the suspects was cornered near Strydom Tunnel. The suspects abandoned it and fled on foot. We recovered a lot of stolen money,” said Mojapelo. He said the suspects have also been linked to other cash heists in Limpopo and Mpumalanga. “During the arrest, the police recovered a white Mercedes-Benz ML, a black Audi, two AK47 rifles, an R4 rifle, a Berretta pistol, two police bulletproof vests, two army issue bulletproof vests, a two-way radio, two bags of money and a blue light. Police in Limpopo also arrested seven cash heist suspects in Seshego extension 73 last week. This was after they robbed an SBV van on Matlala Road. Limpopo police commissioner General Nneke Ledwaba said criminals would be left no space to operate in Limpopo. “The suspects will appear in the Tzaneen Magistrates Court soon and more arrests are expected,” said Ledwaba.
