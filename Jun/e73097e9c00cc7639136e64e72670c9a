THE DA’s legal team has tried to justify the axing of Patricia de Lille. Advocate Sean Rosenberg for the DA said the clause used to remove the mayor of Cape Town was meant to protect the party from disloyal members. He said was speaking in the Western Cape High Court on Tuesday. He said having declared her intention to leave the party in a radio interview in April, De Lille should have foreseen the inevitable consequences of her actions. De Lille’s legal team said she didn’t signal a clear intention to leave the DA when she publicly declared her intention to resign on a radio station. Advocate Johan de Waal said the DA didn’t give her a chance to retract her statement or answer in internal legal DA processes. He said De Lille’s statement didn’t show a lack of loyalty. He said when someone makes a public declaration to resign openly and wants immediate disassociation from the party, you can make it happen. Advocate Dali Mpofu argued earlier on Monday that De Lille didn’t say she was resigning from the DA but rather the mayoral position and that she first wanted to clear her name. De Lille was fired by the DA three weeks ago but bounced back after the court ruled she must retain her position as mayor and DA membership until the current case is finalised.
