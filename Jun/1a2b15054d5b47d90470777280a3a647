RESIDENTS are furious with a family that left a two-roomed house abandoned, leading to it being occupied by whoonga addicts. The residents of B section in KwaMashu, north of Durban said they wanted the owners of the house to either move into it or sell it. The house was abandoned four years ago. A neighbour said members of the family fought, which led to them leaving the house. “I heard the three grandchildren were fighting over the house after the owner, who was their gogo, died. “Now they have all left and no one knows where they went,” said the neighbour. “They don’t even come back to see the house and it has been damaged.” The neighbour said the whoonga addicts soon stole the doors and windows. “Now they sit in the house and smoke whoonga. “We fear they might end up stealing from us. We are not safe because of this abandoned house,” said the neighbour. Another resident said she had tried to trace the family with no success. “People always come to ask about it. Some people want to buy the house. “They should come to an agreement rather than just abandon it,” said the resident. Councillor Muziwenhlanhla Shezi confirmed the house was abandoned because of family problems. “The problem is that the house is now causing trouble for the neighbours and it hasn’t been easy to locate the family. “I would appreciate it if the family could come and see me so we can resolve the problem that led to the house being abandoned in the first place.”
