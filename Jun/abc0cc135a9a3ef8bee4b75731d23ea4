SHE thought she was just helping a friend, but it turned into a horror story that will haunt her for the rest of her life. The 21-year-old from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, agreed to fetch her friend’s brother from hospital last Tuesday. The brother asked to be dropped at his friend’s place in Rabie Ridge. The young woman went into the house to see that he was okay – but the man allegedly pulled out a knife, locked all the doors and raped her repeatedly. Ekurhuleni Metro Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said the man held the woman against her will from Tuesday afternoon until the next morning. “He allegedly assaulted and repeatedly raped her at knifepoint. “The victim eventually had a chance to escape when the perpetrator’s friend arrived back from work on Wednesday morning,” said Kgasago. “The suspect pretended to be going out for a smoke after his victim escaped, and he then disappeared.” He said the police received information about the kidnapping and rape and went searching for the suspect. “The suspect was located in Rabie Ridge and he was arrested. He is facing charges of assault, kidnapping and rape,” said Kgasago. He appeared in the Tembisa Magistrates Court on Friday. The matter was postponed to Friday for a formal bail application.
