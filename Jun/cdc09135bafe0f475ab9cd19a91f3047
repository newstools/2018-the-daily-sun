According to Paballo’s mum Masego Mabetwa (28), liquid starting oozing out of his body when at a young age. Nurses at a nearby clinic gave her cream thinking it was a minor skin problem. Masego also took her son to a dermatologist who prescribed a special cream and soap. Then the boy’s eyes started giving him trouble. After receiving treatment at an eye clinic, a skin sample was taken for testing. The results revealed that Paballo was suffering from a skin condition. He was referred to George Mukhari Hospital, where skin from various parts of his body was grafted onto his lips and head. That seemed to help until the condition spread to other parts of his body, including his face. His left eye had to be removed.
