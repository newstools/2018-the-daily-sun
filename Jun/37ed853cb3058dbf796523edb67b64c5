WHEN security guard Nathaniel Sibanda lost his ID in November 2011, he applied for a new one. After three weeks he received an SMS from Home Affairs, saying he should collect his new ID. But that’s when his troubles started. Instead of getting his ID book, Nathaniel was told that he couldn’t get it because he shared his identity number with another person. The 56-year-old from Orange Farm, south of Joburg said he has visited the Vereeniging Home Affairs offices several times, but he still doesn’t have an ID. “I am desperate for a solution. I have to renew my security number at the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority before the end of this year.” Thabo Mokgola, a spokesman for Home Affairs, said: “Our officials will investigate to ascertain the truth of Nathaniel’s claims and will then contact him.”
