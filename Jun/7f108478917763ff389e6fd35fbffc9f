THE 20-year-old SuperSport United gem Sipho Mbule credits his rise in the professional ranks to the exposure he received while playing in the Engen Knockout Challenge. “SuperSport United’s scouts discovered me when I played in the Knockout Challenge in 2015,” said Mbule, who has also thanked coach Pitso Mokoena from the Harmony Academy and Amajimbos coach Molefi Ntseki for believing in him. “The Engen Knockout Challenge prepares you for the level of competition you will face when you go to places like Joburg, Cape Town or KwaZulu-Natal. It’s where you meet other good players of your age group. “When we played in the Engen Champ of Champs, Grant Margeman was in the Ajax team, which shows you how good the competition was.” Mbule shares a close relationship with SuperSport United teammate and fellow Engen Knockout Challenge graduate Teboho Mokoena. The two highly rated midfielders are tipped to make serious waves for the club and possibly even for the national team in the not-too-distant future. This year’s edition of the Knockout Challenge is sure to unearth more talented youngsters who will follow in the footsteps of Mbule and Mokoena. These aspiring professionals will begin their journey to stardom at the Knockout Challenge in Cape Town from 22-24 June, after which the roadshow moves on to Port Elizabeth from 29 June-1 July), Durban (13-15 July), Bloemfontein (20-22 July) and Joburg (27-29 July). Mokoena was the star of the Free State leg of the Challenge in 2014, before Mbule stole the show a year later, helping Harmony win back-to-back titles. “I think Teboho and I can be the future of the club in midfield because we grew up together. “I played with him at the Harmony Academy and we played together when we won the Challenge in 2014 and 2015,” the confident Mbule said.
