FINALLY – the moment has arrived! The flags of five African nations will fly high in Russian cities from Moscow in the west to Yekaterinburg in the east. MZANSI LOOKS TO AFRICA FOR WORLD CUP GLORY! Nigeria, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia and Senegal are currently in Moscow preparing for the world’s premier sporting event. It starts tonight at 5pm when the match between the hosts and Saudi Arabia kicks off. The tournament continues until 15 July. A galaxy of African stars carry the hopes of the frustrated South Africans forced to watch the tournament without Stuart Baxter’s boys present. Egypt’s most celebrated Liverpool star, Mo Salah and his club Sadio Mane, of Senegal, top the list of African players along with Nigeria’s Daniel Ekpeyi, who plays for Chippa United. But the Super Eagles of Nigeria will fly easily with Victor Moses gunning for the opponents’ goal posts. Saber Khalifa of Tunisia will lead The Eagles of Carthage and Morocco’s Hakim Ziyech will inspire the Atlas Lions. Egypt’s Pharaohs will start Africa’s bid against Uruguay tomorrow at the Central Stadium in Yekaterinburg City, while Morocco gets down to business at the Saint Petersburg Stadium. This will be Nigeria’s sixth appearance in seven finals since making a memorable debut in the USA in 1994. Sadly there are fears that racism may rear its ugly head during the tournament. Russian soccer has been plagued for years by racist incidents in the stands directed at players of colour. Just weeks before the start of the World Cup, Russia’s soccer union was fined R500 000 after fans made monkey noises directed at black players during a game against France in March. But Russia’s antiracism officials have warned that fans who behave in an unacceptable manner will not be treated kindly.
