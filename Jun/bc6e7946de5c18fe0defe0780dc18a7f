IN THIS kasi, residents have no choice but to put thorn trees on their loved ones’ graves. That is their only defence against the cows that have made the local graveyard their home. The battle between the cows and the dead at Roma Cemetery in Matebeleng section of Makapanstad, North West has been raging for the past five years. Resident Sello Matlala (45) said the community is losing the war. “We’ve asked the owners to lock up their cattle, yet we still see cows at the cemetery,” he said. “Some cows even sleep there. “They have turned the dead’s final resting place into their home.” Another community member said she is ashamed to go to her mum’s grave because of the cows. “I’m afraid to go in there. “The last time I went to the cemetery, I found cows sleeping on my mum’s grave. The flowers I planted were nowhere to be found,” she said. “These animals not only eat flowers. They also destroy tombstones. “The situation is very sad for us.” She said the residents are serious about protecting their loved ones’ graves and will do anything to scare away the cows An official from Moretele Municipality said plans are in place to revamp and extend the graveyard.
