Cash-strapped power utility Eskom is "a threat" to
the nation’s investment strategy, Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene has said. The government plans to offer incentives to lure $100bn -
about R1.2trn - in investment to the country, President Cyril Ramaphosa
announced in April. The investment drive is part of an attempt to bolster
economic growth, which hasn’t exceeded 2% annually since 2013. In June StatsSA
announced that SA's real gross domestic product fell by 2.2% in the first
quarter of 2018. The Goldman Sachs Group, meanwhile, said in September that
Eskom - which has more than R62bn due in principal debt payments in the next
five years, was the biggest single risk to the economy. The structure of the economy is limiting the country’s
growth potential, Nene told reporters in Johannesburg Thursday. Nene, and World Economic Forum Head of Africa Elsie Kanza,
were briefing the media on a round table meeting between the WEF and South
Africa. The finance minister said that better regional integration among
Southern African Development Community nations was critical to boost
investment. The country's power grid has been constrained in recent
weeks. Protesters blockaded roads and allegedly attacked and intimidated staff
after wage negotiations between Eskom and its workers broke down earlier this
month. Unions have denied intimidating staff, or sabotaging plants. The power utility first said it couldn’t offer any pay
increase due to poor finances. It later upped its offer to 4.7% and then to 5%.
Unions have rejected both these offers and negotiations are continuing. The interruptions forced Eskom to introduce load shedding
for the first time since 2015, although Eskom has not had to introduce
rotational power cuts since Sunday 16 June. SOURCE: NEWS24
