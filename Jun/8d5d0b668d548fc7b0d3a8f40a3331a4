A MIGRANT from Mali became a hero after saving a child from falling from a fourth-floor balcony in Paris, France. Mamoudou Gassama (22), who took just seconds to save the child, has since been rewarded with French citizenship. The video shows Mamoudou scaling the building at breakneck speed and pulling himself up like a superhero. Once he gets to the young child he helps the little one get to safety. But social media users also saw a funny side to the tense affair and took to sharing memes and jokes. People from all over the world, including Africa and Mzansi, posted videos and pictures mimicking the actual footage of the incident. Some climb walls and some climb flag poles to collect dolls, beer and some grab nothing at all. Some crazies even put real babies on a balcony and later climb up as if they were rescuing them. Some said they hoped they could get citizenship for their bravery.
