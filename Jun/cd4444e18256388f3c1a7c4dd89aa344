GUN owners with expired licences will have to hand over their firearms immediately or face the legal consequences. About 400 000 people have failed to renew their firearm licences, which means they are now illegally in possession of the weapons. This emerged from a recent judgment by the Constitutional Court, which has been welcomed by the SAPS. Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, national police spokesman, said: “We welcome the judgment and we are calling on all those who have not renewed their firearm licences to bring their guns in. If we find them, you will be arrested.” Naidoo said the ruling came after a long court battle between the South African Hunters’ and Game Conservation Association and the ministry of police. He said owning a firearm was not a right, but a privilege regulated by the Firearms Control Act. The association argued in court that the cops were not able to handle the surrender of thousands of firearms, but Naidoo said the SAPS would manage it and make it work. He said firearm owners knew they had to apply for a renewal of their licences in time or get rid of their guns before they expired, otherwise they were guilty of an offence. “In the context of the recent spate of children being shot and killed following defensive gun use, the significance of the Constitutional Court judgment cannot be emphasised enough,” said Naidoo.
