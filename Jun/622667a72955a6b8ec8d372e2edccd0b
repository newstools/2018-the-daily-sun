THIS 25-year-old mum from Mahlabathini, northern KwaZulu-Natal said she was happy the KZN Department of Health has finally agreed to meet her. Nonhlelo Zungu is blaming staff at Nkonjeni Hospital for the death of her baby boy. She said while giving birth on 19 July 2016, a doctor used steel forceps to pull out the baby. She said she noticed that the baby’s head was swollen but a doctor told her to go home because he was fine. Nonhlelo said when her mother was bathing the baby the next day, they realised the baby’s head was injured. They took him back to the hospital but sadly, he died two days later. She said since 2016 she had been fighting for justice and the hospital was refusing to take responsibility for her baby’s death and instead blamed her. Nonhlelo told Daily Sun that she is meeting officials from the hospital today. “I’m happy they finally saw the need to meet me. Since 2016, I have been trying to get them to account for my baby’s death after a post mortem result showed that it was their fault,” she said. Nonhlelo plans to tell the officials that she wants R3 million as compensation for the loss of her child and the trauma she went through. She said the hospital must pay to clear her name because nurses blamed her for her baby’s death. KZN Health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said the hospital has asked Nonhlelo to come and meet the CEO. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said an inquest was investigated but was later closed.
