POWER outages could be a serious problem this winter, but Rand Water says it is prepared. To ensure that water supply is not disrupted in Gauteng, the utility has invested in custom-built generators for emergencies. The new generators were unveiled at Rand Water’s mobile generator farm in Roodepoort, Joburg yesterday. CEO Sipho Mosai said they started working on the project in 2014. “In case of power outages, these generators will continue to pump around 50% of the required water into the reservoirs,” said Mosai. “Without the generators, the reservoirs might run dry – and it would take days to refill the reservoirs to their full capacity.” He said Rand Water’s pipe network reached through Gauteng, Free State, Mpumalanga and North West, and the utility had a duty to provide water to these areas. “Water is absolutely essential. When there is no water it is not only houses that are affected,” said Mosai. “There are patients in hospitals, fire stations, people at work and farmers who have to provide food “Many industries suffer if that one resource is not there. But these generators will do the trick.” Mosai said they had fixed generators and also mobile ones that could be moved to various locations. “There are 18 mobile generators and four fixed ones. We could not find generators like this locally, so we have had to have them custom-built.”
