THOZAMILE Gawula, known as “Iron Man”, will pay for his crimes. The 30-year-old from Ikhwezi in Mthatha was yesterday sentenced to eight years behind bars for attempted murder by magistrate Sizakele Sihlahla. This comes after the Mthatha Magistrates Court last month found Gawula guilty of burning his girlfriend, Mihle Sibembe (26), with a hot iron on Christmas Day in 2016. He admitted that the attack was motivated by jealousy after Sibembe posted a photo of herself with another man on Facebook. The victim was left with burns on her thighs, private parts, bum, back, face and stomach. Before sentencing, a victim impact statement that Sibembe handed in on Monday was read out by prosecutor Noluthando Mgqibelo. In the statement, Sibembe said she was still traumatised by the attack and was not coping well at school. She said she could not even stand in front of a class and present a statement, and she still feared for her life. She said she had to go for counselling and wanted Gawula to be put behind bars. Mgqibelo asked the court to sentence Gawula to 10 years in prison. She said Gawula was supposed to protect Sibembe. “There was no need for the accused to do what he did. It is becoming the norm for ex-boyfriends to kill or assault their exes. She was lucky to survive,” said Mgqibelo. Gawula’s Legal Aid lawyer, who gave his name as Mr Mbarane, said the burns were not something that Sibembe would not recover from. He asked the court to take into consideration that his client pleaded guilty, and asked for a sentence of five years. Before sentencing, Sihlahla told Gawula that women were not the property of men. Sibembe’s mum, Zodumo, said she would have liked a longer sentence.
