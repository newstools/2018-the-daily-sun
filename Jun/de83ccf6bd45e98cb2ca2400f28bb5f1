ABOUT 300 poor kids have been denied a daily meal for over a week – all thanks to Eskom! Gogo Eva Rammutla, who runs a soup kitchen to feed underprivileged kids at least one meal a day, told Daily Sun she was furious with the power utility. The 64-year-old from Ivory Park, Joburg, said the problem started when an Eskom transformer in her yard burst into flames and her food preparation and storage areas were burned. She said she called the power utility many times to try and get the problem attended to with no success. Gogo Rammutla said the soup kitchen fed about 300 kids a day but it had not been operating since Wednesday. "I called Eskom at 8am on Wednesday to explain the transformer was spewing oil all over. They promised to send someone over within four hours but no one came,” said gogo Eva. By 8pm the situation worsened and the transformer burst into flames, which soon spread. “Everything that had oil on it caught fire. The storage area where we keep curtains we sell to make money for the kitchen burned down,” said gogo Eva. “Our washing machine was also damaged. To stop the fire, community members broke down the gate. This has left the soup kitchen without any security.” Gogo Eva said she had five reference numbers after phoning Eskom but nothing ever happened. “Eskom promised to send an official to assess the damage. That person hasn’t come. It must compensate me for the damage,” she said. Eskom spokesman Nkosana Sibuyi said investigations into these things took time. “If there’s damage to property, the customer has the right to submit a claim for damages,” he said. Sibuyi said incidents such as this were generally caused by overloading due to illegal connections.
