A PROMINENT member of the Swartruggens community appeared briefly yesterday in the local magistrates court in the North West town, where he faced charges of raping minors. The 53-year-old man, who hasn’t yet pleaded and can’t be identified as one of the victims is a relative, was arrested earlier last month. He was charged with the rape of young girls at a high school in the area and denied bail. The accused is an SGB member, a treasurer for a business organisation, a former chairman of a community radio station, and a churchgoer. The community came to know of the allegations when the accused allegedly confiscated the orphaned girl’s phone. The principal at the school was notified and the matter was taken forward. The accused remains in custody and the case was postponed to 8 August.
