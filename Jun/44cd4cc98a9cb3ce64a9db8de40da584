LIMPOPO Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba visited Kgapane Hospital in Bolobedu, Limpopo last Wednesday. The visit came after there were several negative reports about the treatment of patients at the hospital. The MEC identified poor leadership as the major challenge facing the hospital. One of the complaints trending on Facebook was about an 88-year-old gogo who arrived at midnight but was forced to wait for many hours before getting help. The gogo was allegedly left to sleep in a wheelchair. Ramathuba spoke to some patients who voiced their concerns. Motsatsi Ramothwala (44) said they are often forced to wait hours before getting help. “Before we get help, we must queue to get our files. “The process takes hours because our cards are not properly filed. Some nurses are rude and take advantage of us. “We hope the MEC’s visit will change things around because we cannot handle the bad treatment,” she said. Ramathuba introduced a new interim management, acting CEO, acting clinical manager and acting nursing manager as a temporary solution while recruitment processes are under way. Ramathuba warned health officials to stop taking their frustrations out on patients. “Patients told me you are rude and heartless towards them. If you are unhappy, take your frustrations out on me,” she said. “Do not ever forget why you are here, because your mandate is to serve the people.” The visit also forms part of the #Officemustfall campaign. The department is also finalising equipping the Modjadjis-kloof Clinic in order to accept some maternity patients and outpatients so that relief can be given to Kgapane Hospital.
