COPS in Bandelierkop in the Makhado area of Limpopo have arrested
four suspects involved in the shooting
of security officers at a local farm. Cops Â spokesperson
Constable Maphure Manamela said this follows an incident that occurred on a
farm between Elim and Vleifontein area. He said it is alleged that four security guards were
posted at the Avocado Farm when they were confronted by four suspects, one
armed with a firearm. The gunman allegedly shot randomly at the guards who then
ran in different directions. Manamela said one of the guards was hit by a stray bullet
and was ultimately caught by the suspects who then assaulted him. He said the perpetrators fled before the arrival of the
cops. The injured security officer was taken to hospital but
later succumbed to his injuries. "The intensified investigation by the detectives
ensued immediately and subsequently four suspects aged between 24 and 36 years
were arrested in Magangeni village," he said. The suspects will appear before the Louise Trichardt
Magistrate's Court on 21 June to face charges of murder and attempted murder.
