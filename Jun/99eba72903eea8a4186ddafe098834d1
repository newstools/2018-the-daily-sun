MEMBERS of the Khambule family believe their faith saved them when they fought petrol bombs in their house. A man entered their yard in White City, Soweto, in the early hours of Friday morning and threw petrol bombs while they were sleeping. Gogo Dorah Khambule (58) said a petrol bomb was thrown into three rooms, but the fire did not spread after they started praying. “I was sleeping with my daughter and granddaughter in the main bedroom when I heard a window break, and suddenly there was fire on our bed,” she said. “Usually curtains and beds catch fire and it spreads very quickly, but the flames did not spread.” A bomb was also thrown into the window of an outside room, where a 15-year-old boy was sleeping, and he said the flames did not spread there either. Nhlanhla Khambule (29), who is a sangoma, said when a bomb came into his indumba he started praying and the fire burned only the curtains. “I ran outside and saw a man in a white jacket jumping over the wall. He left his fourth bomb behind,” he said. Sibongile Khambule (33), who was sleeping in the main bedroom with her mum, said the attacker obviously wanted to kill them as he targeted rooms where people were sleeping. She said she felt lucky to have survived the attack and thanked God for it. Nomsa Khambule (36), the mum of a two-year-old girl who was sleeping with her gogo in the main bedroom, was working a night shift. Police opened cases of arson and attempted murder.
