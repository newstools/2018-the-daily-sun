HE MAY be blind, but that hasn’t stopped Sibusiso Mdlalose from becoming a cricket ace! The 41-year-old from Braamfisherville, Joburg, used to be bored at home but now he can’t get enough of being outside. Sibusiso said a friend encouraged him to play cricket. “I went for training for two days,” he said. “After training I joined the Central Gauteng Blind Cricket development side.” He said the same year he joined, in 2004, he played his first game in Cape Town during the National Blind Cricket tournament. “We lost all our games, but I fell in love with the sport. Cricket made me believe in myself and helped me forget all my troubles. It also brought me closer to other blind people,” he said. In 2010, Sibusiso was chosen to represent Mzansi in Cape Town against Pakistan, and in 2012 he was part of the National Blind Cricket team that played in India. His highlight was when he was selected as the Cricket Player of the Year in 2010. When Sibusiso is not playing cricket, he does cycling and already took part in the 94.7 cycling race. He used to be a facilitator at different NGOs in Ekurhuleni, where he taught blind people Braille for 10 years. He now teaches anyone who needs his help and it’s free of charge.
