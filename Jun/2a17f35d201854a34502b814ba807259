The Peoples’ Paper has done it again! Daily Sun is considered the coolest daily in a poll conducted by the Sunday Times Generation Next Youth survey. This survey is considered the leading barometer of what Mzansi’s kids, teens and young adults consider to be on trend. In an annual poll of more than 12 000 youth across the country, Daily Sun is regarded as the coolest daily of them all. “As the Daily Sun we are thrilled that young people continue to consider us cool. We once more say thank you as we welcome the award. Our promise to those who continue to vote for us is that we will forever stay cool,” said Reggy Moalusi, Daily Sun’s editor-in-chief. The paper beat Daily News, TimesLive, The Daily Voice and The Citizen. Other dailies did not even make it into the top five. In the weekend category, our sister paper Sunday Sun came second after the Sunday Times.
