POACHING is a big problem for South African National Parks. Although many poachers have been arrested over the years, the brains behind their illegal operations often avoid capture. However, it looks like the tide is turning. Last Monday, the Hawks arrested two alleged poaching kingpins operating in Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga. The arrests were announced yesterday. The Hawks’ Colonel Johan Jooste said Mandla Mashele (37) and Calvin Malapane (30) from Benoni‚ Ekurhuleni, were charged with illegally buying rhino horn. He said they appeared in the Benoni Magistrates Court last Wednesday and were released on R50 000 bail each. Jooste said their second court appearance is scheduled for next Wednesday. He said the poachers sell the rhino horn to clients in South East Asia. “We have disrupted the supply chain,” said Jooste. Sanparks CEO Fundisile Mketeni said: “We have six rhino parks and more than 500 rhinos that are protected in other parts of the country. “We have seen a high number of rhino killings, but next year we want the figure to drop to less than 400. “In 2020, we want it to be less than 160.” According to Mketeni, rhino horns can go for as much as R1,5 million each on the black market. He said elephant poaching is on the rise. Mketeni said over the past year, 23 Sanpark rangers have been arrested for poaching related activity.
