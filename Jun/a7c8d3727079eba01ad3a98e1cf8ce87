THE Hawks have arrested a 34-year-old police constable from the Bellville South Community Service Centre (CSC) on allegations of theft and corruption. Two firearms were reportedly seized by SAPS members from two suspects on separate incidents in September 2017 and another in April 2018 respectively. “Further investigations by the Hawks revealed that the two firearms were among the 18 that were reportedly stolen at Bellville South SAPS in August 2017,” Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said. Mulaudzi added that several firearms that were handed in as exhibits and deemed for destruction apparently went missing from a storeroom at the Bellville South police station. “The missing weapons are still a centre of a police investigation,” Mulaudzi said. Mulaudzi said the police constable is accused to have allegedly participated in the theft of the firearms and he is expected to appear at Bellville Magistrate’s Court.
