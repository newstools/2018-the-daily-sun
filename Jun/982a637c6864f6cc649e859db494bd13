NEW Baroka FC head coach Wedson Nyirenda has expressed his desire to work with technical director Doctor “16V” Khumalo. The former Zambian head coach, who joined Bakgaga this month on a two-year contract, told SunSport yesterday he had no beef with the experienced footballer, saying “I would love for the former Kaizer Chiefs coach to continue with his job and keep bringing his intellect to the team”. Added Nyirenda, who also played with Khumalo at Amakhosi in the 1990s: “Doctor is a great guy. I don’t have any issues working with Khumalo. He is a very intelligent and respected guy in the country. He is also very knowledgeable in football. I would love to work with him. “But I am not the one who employs him, it’s the management. And the management will decide whether they keep him or not.” This is contrary to what Baroka chairman Khurishi Mphahlele said a fortnight ago when he indicated that the ball was in Nyirenda’s court to decide on Khumalo’s future with the Limpopo side. The former Bafana Bafana midfielder, who joined Baroka as technical director last season and had a brief stint as interim coach, has a contract with Bakgaga that expires at the end of the week. “Khumalo was hired to help our former coach, Kgoloko Thobejane,” said Mphahlele two weeks ago. “Now Nyirenda will tell us whether he wants to keep Doctor or not. We do not want to interfere with the coach’s work.” As things stand, it is unclear whether the club will offer Khumalo a new contract when this one expires. Khumalo, who has 50 caps for Bafana to his name, has also been linked with a return to Chiefs to succeed Steve Komphela. Meanwhile, Nyirenda got down to business at Bakgaga upon his return from Zambia, taking his charges through their paces this week ahead of the new season that starts early in August. “I went home to sort out a few things and now we have started with the groundwork,” the new coach said. “We will decide in the coming days which positions need to be strengthened.”
