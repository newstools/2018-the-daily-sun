TREES were planted at Johannes Kananda Primary School yesterday in memory of Gabisile Shabane. The 13-year-old was murdered earlier this year because she was an albino. She attended the school in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga. Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa and Gabisile’s mum, Anna, planted the trees to commemorate International Albinism Day. Mthethwa said people must not discriminate against people with albinism and their bodies were not lucky charms. “Blood is the same and there’s no luck in people living with albinism. Their senseless killing must stop and everyone must make sure they are protected at all times,” he said. “Sangomas who say albino body parts are good for muthi are brain-dead. “People must work hard to earn a good living and must not believe albinos will bring them luck.” Mthethwa said the trees were planted so Gabisile would always be remembered. “The people who have this condition belong to us. People must stop digging their bodies up from graves,” he said. Tryphina Nhlapho – who is living with albinism – said people must stop calling them names and discriminating against them. “These trees mean the spirit of Gabisile shall live long. She will always be remembered. We must not be made to suffer because of our condition. We are not animals that bring luck to people who want to be rich,” she said. Gabisile and her 15-month-old nephew, Nkosikhona Ngwenya, were kidnapped from their home by four armed men in January. They were both killed and their bodies were found in February.
