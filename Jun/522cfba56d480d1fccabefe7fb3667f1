THE Gauteng Health Department has agreed to pay bonuses owed. This comes after the department met the National Health Education and Allied Workers Union on Friday following protests at hospitals in Joburg. Charlotte Maxeke Hospital and Mohlakeng Clinic were hardest hit, as protesters ignored patients while raging through the facilities. Calm was restored and operations returned to normal on Friday. Nehawu said the department had promised payments for the 2016/2017 financial year would be made this month. A meeting was set for tomorrow to finalise outstanding issues. “This is a victory for our members and workers,” the union said. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi assured the public that things were back to normal. “We have about 1 000 patients in the wards and other coming into casualty. Emergency operations are being attended to,” he said. The Democratic Nursing Organisation has called for Motsoaledi to step down after he described strikers’ actions as hooliganism.
