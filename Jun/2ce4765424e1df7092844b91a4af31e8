SIYABULELA Fakade (36), who allegedly stabbed his wife Thandiwe and killed her lover Abongile Tsengiwe (32), was granted R2 000 bail in the Ngcobo Magistrates Court yesterday. In his affidavit, read by his laywer Bongani Mtati before Magistrate Portia Maliza, the accused said it was in the interest of justice that he be released on bail. He said he was the sole breadwinner and supported two young kids. He said he’d plead not guilty to charges of murder and attempted murder. His affidavit read: “What happened was unfortunate and unplanned. “I have a two-year-old son who’s now living with his grandmother. He’s crying, asking about my whereabouts. “I submitted myself to the cops and I’m not a flight risk. I’ll not endanger the public or evade trial.” Prosecutor Sikhona Ndika read a statement prepared by the investigating officer, Warrant Officer Nkosinathi Qongqo, saying Fakade was unlikely to interfere with investigations or evade trial. “The accused called his wife, and when she didn’t answer her phone he went to her flat in Ngcobo. When he got there, his wife was not at her flat and he waited for her. “When his wife eventually arrived, she was in a vehicle driven by the person he suspected was her boyfriend. “Then out of anger he stabbed him and his wife with a knife.” Tsengiwe’s cousin Monwabisi said the family wasn’t happy that Fakade was granted bail. His bail conditions state that he may not have physical contact with his wife, who’s still in hospital. He was arrested on 11 June.
