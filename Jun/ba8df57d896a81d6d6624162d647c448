TV presenter and entrepreneur Maps Maponyane is living his best life in Europe. The multi talented media personality has not had an easy couple of weeks after making headlines and trending on social media for all the wrong reasons. What better way to put all of that drama behind him than by exploring one of the most beautiful islands in the world, Sicily, with historic sites. This comes after Nomzamo Mbatha also took some time away to unwind at the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic, New York City’s hottest social event of the summer last week. A look at Maps Instagram suggests the 28 year-old also visited France, posting a picture of himself having tea at a Paris hotel. Check out some of the pictures from Maps’ European getaway.
