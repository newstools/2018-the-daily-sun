OFFERS have been pouring in for Tsepo Masilela after Kaizer Chiefs confirmed his exit from Naturena. But he is refusing to talk teams, the 33-year-old merely saying that he “will continue playing football” in the 2018-19 season. The former Bafana Bafana defender was one of five players released by the Soweto giants after the club’s dismal season that saw chairman Kaizer Motaung cancel the club’s awards ceremony this year. Other Chiefs players shown the door are Keagan Buchanan, William Twala, Sibusiso Khumalo and Edmore Chirambadare. The ageing player said he was currently enjoying his holiday but would shed more light on his next move before the end of June. “I am still on holidays and can’t talk about my future now,” said Masilela, who has even been linked with a move to the United States of America. “Trust me, I will continue playing football. Let’s talk next week.” Free State Stars and Chippa United have apparently also approached him with a view of luring him into their camp. Masilela joined Amakhosi in 2012 from Spanish side Getafe FC. In his six years with the Soweto giants, the Emalahleni-born player won the Absa Premiership title twice, in the 2012-13 and 2014-15 seasons. Masilela won the Nedbank Cup in 2013 and the MTN8 in 2014. He did not see much action last season due to injuries and this may have been the driving force behind Chiefs’ decision not to renew his contract, also taking into account his age. Masilela has played for Israeli outfit Maccabi Haifa too, where he won two Israel Premier League titles. The veteran player has also played 51 games for Bafana.
