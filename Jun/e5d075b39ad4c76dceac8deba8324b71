EASTERN Cape police are looking for four evil thugs who shot and killed one of their own in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday afternoon. National police commissioner General Khehla Sitole condemned the senseless killing and ordered his members to waste no time in busting the suspects. The cop was identified as Detective Constable Bonga Ngcingwana. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said the 35-year-old constable was shot and killed in Mendi Road in New Brighton at about 3pm. Ngcingwana, from Mount Road cop shop, and his partner had stopped a silver Toyota Etios. “They got out of their bakkie and four suspects alighted from the Etios,” said Beetge. The suspects allegedly fired several shots at the cops. “Ngcingwana was shot several times. His partner managed to take cover and wasn’t injured. “Another police vehicle from New Brighton, unaware of what had happened, came across the scene and the suspects opened fire. “Police responded by shooting back but the suspects managed to escape. The wounded constable died on the way to hospital.” Sitole said Eastern Cape police commissioner Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga should establish a task team and activate the 72-hour reaction plan to hunt down the perpetrators. “If you kill one of our own, we’ll hunt you down until we find and arrest you,” he said. “Police killers don’t deserve to live among law-abiding citizens.” He said they deserve to rot in jail!
