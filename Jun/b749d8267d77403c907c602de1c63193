RESIDENTS of Siyanda, north of Durban, said they cannot stand the smell and filth in their area. They want the eThekwini Municipality to sort it out before they start getting sick. Residents said waste was not collected on Thursday and the municipality had not bothered to explain why. A resident, Nkazimulo Zondi (43), said:“Our area has many residents as many houses are close to each other. “That is why there is a lot of waste. “If it is not collected in time, this area becomes filthy and smelly. “The smell and filth are not healthy and can cause illnesses,” said Nkazimulo. He said dogs and chickens had flocked to the road to eat from the rubbish. Another resident, Nonjabulo Mdletshe (39), said when she noticed waste scattered on the road she had to make sure her two children, aged 3 and 5 years old, did not play outside the house. She said she feared that they could inhale the smell and get sick. “Sometimes kids love to play with dirty things, that is why I cannot allow mine to play outside because it is so dirty there.” Ward councillor Mamane Xulu said she did not know waste had not been collected. “Residents should have informed me instead of reporting the matter to Daily Sun. “Although I did not know waste had not been collected, what I know is that waste collectors are on strike. But I will contact the municipality to come and collect it.”
