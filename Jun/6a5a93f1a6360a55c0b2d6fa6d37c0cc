Of all the dance moves in Mzansi, Vosho seems to be the
most difficult of them all. Although, Mzansi people are known to be good dancers,
it's a only few who can pull a vosho anytime. Most of the time, those who attempt vosho go down but never manage to rise. This dance move seems to be reserved only for flexible and fit
people. Mzansi's DJ FRESH posted a video of a woman attempting
vosho on his Facebook Page. He captioned it: "Some Dance moves #Vosho need for you to
be on medical aid!" In the video, the woman is seen pulling nice dance moves
in the beginning. But all hell broke loose when she attempted vosho. She went down and struggled to lift herself up. Another
woman who was seated on a chair next to her,Â  then tries to help her up but both them ended up lying on the ground.
