AS if midyear examinations are not stressful enough, pupils at Leonard Ntshuntshe Secondary School in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, also have to worry about how to keep warm. The pupils said the broken windows at the school were supposed to be fixed before exam season. Some pupils said the situation had a negative effect on their academic performance. One grade 10 pupil said she has to wear a lot of clothes to stay warm. “We are struggling to write our midyear exams. “Sometimes we do not finish our exams. “If the windows are not fixed during the school holidays, then we are going to suffer a lot in July,” she said. A grade 9 pupil said although the exams he had written were not hard, the cold weather had made it hard for him to concentrate. He said: “When we are done writing we run outside to sit in the sun. “We don’t want to have problems during the rainy season.” Provincial education spokesman Jasper Zwane said schools received money from the department and some of it must be used for basic maintenance. Zwane said: “The school must use that money to fix the problem.”
