COPS in Bloemfontein need SunReaders’ help to find Lereng John Meku. Police say they need the 28-year-old man to help them with their investigation into the murder of the Hawks captain who was shot and killed at his home two weeks ago. Captain Qeya Tshabalala (52) was shot multiple times after three men broke into his home at Rocklands kasi in Mangaung on 24 May. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said Tshabalala was home at about 8.45pm in Tau Street when he was attacked by the three armed men. Mbambo said the suspects fled the scene with the state vehicle, his service pistol and a cellphone. “The vehicle was later found abandoned near Jimmy Roos School in Dewetsdorp. She added that one of the suspects in the murder, Sprinkaan Maema (33), appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court on Monday in connection with the murder. He was arrested in the early hours of Friday morning between Dewetsdorp and Wepener, a few kilometres from where the stolen vehicle was found. The case was postponed to 13 June for a formal bail application. Two suspects are still at large. “Anyone with information in connection with the whereabouts of the men or witness that can assist in the investigation should call Colonel Nthako Mkhawulezi on 082 527 7504.”
