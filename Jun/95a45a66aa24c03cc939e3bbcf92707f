JOBURG Metro cops were shocked yesterday over the arrest of an off-duty officer who had been involved in fatal crash on Sunday evening. The officer, who was driving an official car, was allegedly drunk when the incident happened. The three-car pile up that claimed the lives of three people happened on the Golden Highway near Lenasia South, Gauteng. The officer, assigned to the VIP Protection Unit, was arrested on three counts of culpable homicide related to the death of a 20-year-old mum, her eight-month-old baby and an eight-year-old relative. A father, who was driving the second vehicle, and his 11-year-old daughter were taken to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. No injuries were reported in a taxi which was also involved in the accident. Fortunately for the officer, he escaped with only minor injuries. Metro cop chief David Tembe said yesterday that officers from head office were at the scene to compile a report for the police. Tembe sent his condolences to those families who had lost their loved ones in the tragic accident. He also reassured the public that his department would co-operate fully with the investigation and it welcomed the arrest of the officer. “As law enforcement officers we are always on duty. We are there to ensure the safety of the community in the city. “Officers should be held accountable for their actions,” Tembe said. The arrested officer will appear in the Lenasia Magistrates Court today.
