Job losses that may result from the implementation of the national minimum wage can be avoided if businesses apply for an exemption, said President Cyril Ramaphosa. In a written response to a question by DA leader Mmusi Maimane in Parliament, Ramaphosa clarified steps government is taking to mitigate an estimated 715 000 job losses resulting from the bill's implementation. The bill was passed by the National Assembly in May, following months of engagement with various stakeholders.    “The exemption process is the most important mitigating factor in relation to the implementation of the national minimum wage as it is designed to avoid job losses.” He added that the impact of the national minimum wage on jobs will only be known after a number of years following its implementation. Ramaphosa said that there are different estimates of job losses, but research also showed that there are “productivity gains” linked to higher earnings and increased household expenditure.
