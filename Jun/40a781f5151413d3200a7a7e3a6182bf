THE Thwala family is furious. They told Daily Sun they’ve been living like crocodiles in a swamp while authorities turned a blind eye. This after a leaking water pipe turned their yard in The Orchards, Tshwane, into a wetland! Legion Thwala (37) said he didn’t know what caused the pipe to start leaking next to the water metre outside his yard four weeks ago. “We live like crocodiles because we are surrounded by water. This has been going on for weeks and it looks like no one cares,” he said. Legion said he reported the leaking pipe to the municipality as soon as he discovered it. “Two city workers arrived and dug up the ground with the intention of locate the leak. However, a few minutes later they told me they were unable to work because of the big roots of a tree near the water meter.” He said they gave him a form to fill in and left. “They told me relevant people would come and fix the pipe, but up until today no one has come.” Legion said he was worried he’d be expected to pay the water bill. He said he was also worried about the safety of children because the affected area was left unsecured. When the People’s Paper spoke to Lindela Mashigo, the City of Tshwane spokesman, he said the pipe was fixed. “Water and sanitation workers fixed the pipe. The City apologises to the resident for the inconvenience caused,” he said. But the City’s claim was rejected by Legion. “No one has come to fix the pipe. We are still waiting for them and our bill keeps increasing,” he said. When Daily Sun contacted Mashigo again on Tuesday, he said a team was on site and replacing the faulty metering system.
