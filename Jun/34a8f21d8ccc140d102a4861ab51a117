JULEN Lopetegui has been removed as Spain soccer squad manager just two days before the World Cup tournament kicks off in Russia. According to The Guardian, his swift removal follows him signing a three-year deal to take over as head coach of Real Madrid after the World Cup. He would replace Zinedine Zidane. The Spanish Football Association president, Luis Rubiales was quoted in the report as saying: “We have been forced to dispense with the national coach. We wish him the greatest of luck. “The negotiations have occurred without any information to the Spanish FA and we were informed just five minutes before the press release. There’s a way to act that needs to be fulfilled.” Whether or not this will negatively impact on Spain’s performance in the tournament will become clearer when they face Portugal in their first match on Friday.
