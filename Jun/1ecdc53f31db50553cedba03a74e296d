Now that Real Talk with Anele will become Real Talk with Azania as of Monday, 18 June, all sorts of rumours are doing the rounds. Fans are still trying to figure out why popular media personality, Anele Mdoda left the show so abruptly, causing the SABC to give the job to Azania Mosaka. Many people are also wondering if Azania’s takeover is a plan that has been in the works for a while, considering the fact that Azania was asked to stand in for Anele while she was away in April. And now new speculations have surfaced around Azania’s first few guests. The first being that Queen B*, Bonang Matheba will be her very first guest on the show next week Monday. If that is the case, then perhaps it might prove that Anele was really the one against Bonang being on the show all this time. It has also been alleged that DJ Zinhle will follow the queen as a guest on the show come Tuesday, 19 June. How spicy? All we have to say is... via GIPHY
