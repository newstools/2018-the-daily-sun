XOLANI Nyathi (40) from Langa, Cape Town, has worked at a resturant in 2008 when he decided to start a business. “My friend taught me how to make leather caps. I didn’t want to copy his work, so I decided to make caps from empty cans,” he said. He also makes skirts, bins, bags and bowls. Xolani said he searches bins to find the cans. “My wife and my cousin also help me to collect the cans. I hired homeless people to gather the cans, but they disappear after I pay them and only come back when they’re broke. “I just want to get the homeless off the streets. I offered accommodation to one of the homeless people I work with. When I realise a person is committed to learning, I teach them how to make the caps so that they can start their own business.” Xolani said his family relies on him for money. “This job enables me to pay rent and look after my children.” He said he sells more than 10 caps a day in summer because that is when a lot of tourists visit the country. “Some tourists buy more than five at once because they want all their family members to have a cap.” Xolani said his caps cost R250 each. “I love what I do. That is why I don’t mind spending lots of time at work. I’m not motivated by money.”
