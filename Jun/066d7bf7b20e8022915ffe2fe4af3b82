AN EFF leader sustained serious injuries after being beaten up by a vigilante group. Sakhile Mbatha, an EFF leader in Utrecht, northern KZN, is demanding R100 000 in damages from the crime-fighting group Isikebhe Community Forum. The group has been operating in the northern parts of the province for years and is known for its brutality against livestock theft suspects. Mbatha, who is the chairman of the EFF’s ward 3 branch in Emadlangeni Municipality, said the group stormed his homestead and forced him into a van on Saturday. He said the group forced him to confess to stealing cattle in 2016. They also moered him with sticks. “I had to confess to save my life. After the incident I was rushed to hospital. “On Monday one of the group members called me and said they wanted to settle the matter because they realised they were wrong,” he said. Mbatha said he went to see his lawyer on Wednesday and agreed that if the suspects wanted an out of court settlement they would have to pay R100 000 as compensation for his injuries. He said he would meet the members of the group on Sunday to discuss the offer. Isikebhe president Joseph Manyathi said he would only comment after he received a report from the Utrecht branch’s leadership. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of assault was opened.
