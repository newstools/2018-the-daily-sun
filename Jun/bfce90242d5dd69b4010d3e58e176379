A Lotus River traffic cop shot and killed his teacher wife on
Monday morning and then turned the gun on himself in Cape Town. Local cops say, the 32-year-old man shot and fatally wounded his wife, who is in her thirties in Brookford Road at around 08:00 in the morning. Spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana told News24 that the
Western Cape Education Department said the woman had been a teacher at
Battswood Primary School in nearby Ottery. "This is a terribly sad incident and our thoughts are
with the educatorâ€™s family, friends, and the whole school community," said
department spokesperson Bronagh Hammond. The City of Cape Town confirmed that the man had previously
been attached to their law enforcement auxiliary unit as a volunteer. In a statement the Executive Director for Safety and
Security, Richard Bosman in the City of Cape Town confirmed that the person in
question was an auxiliary (part-time) Law Enforcement officer, but no longer
