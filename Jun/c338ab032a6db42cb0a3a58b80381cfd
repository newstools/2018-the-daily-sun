THREE thugs thought their carefully laid plan would put them in the driver’s seat for a long time. But they were bust after they hijacked a white Colt bakkie on Tuesday and kidnapped its driver. They later tied him to a tree and drove off – but while they were driving around having a good time, their victim managed to untie himself. The man got a lift to the nearest cop shop, and before the sun had set the suspects were arrested. The incident happened in Roodepan, near Kimberley in Northern Cape. Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock said members of the Kimberley flying squad received a report from the Barkly West cop shop at about 3.50pm. “It was reported that three male suspects, aged between 29 and 34, allegedly drove off with the victim from the Roodepan sewage farm and left him stranded in the veld between Windsorton and Barkly West,” said Kock. “The suspects tied him to a tree and assaulted and threatened him with a knife and toy gun before taking his cellphone, bank card and an undisclosed amount of cash, and fleeing with the bakkie.” “The victim managed to untie himself and he was picked up by a passing car, which took him to the Barkly West cop shop. “The flying squad noticed the bakkie exiting a petrol station close to Warrenton. Police managed to chase down the vehicle and arrested the occupants.” Kock said the three were charged with hijacking, armed robbery and kidnapping. They will appear in court soon.
