Missing Cape Town school girl Stacey Adams was
found dead in a shallow grave next to a Wendy house near her home in Eastridge
on Sunday, her devastated grandmother Laeeqah Adams said. "All I can say now is that she is lying there
now in a hollow grave," said a distraught Mrs Adams. But as the family was still reeling in shock, angry
neighbours in the Mitchells Plain suburb tried to flush out the man they
suspected of killing her and petrol bombed his sister's house. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said on
Saturday at about 15:00 Stacey's grandmother sent her to her mother's house in
De La Rey Street, Eastridge. On Sunday her grandmother contacted her daughter to
ask her to get Stacey, also known as Jamie, ready because she was going to
fetch her. It was apparently only then that they realised that
the child was missing, police said. At 15:00 they reported the child missing at
Mitchells Plain police station and an immediate search was launched by the
police, assisted by neighbourhood watches, street Committees, Sector Crime
Forum members and the Community Policing Forum.
