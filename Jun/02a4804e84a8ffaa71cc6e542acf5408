CONFUSION is in charge at Gauteng’s provincial cop shops. The small guy, the ordinary cop, doesn’t know what to believe anymore. It appears the Iron Lady, Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange, is definitely staying put. On Tuesday, Daily Sun learnt there was a new sheriff in town and former provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mzwandile Petros was set to take the reins again. But in a new twist, things changed and her recall was apparently reversed. This was revealed at a press conference in Tshwane yesterday. Daily Sun ran a series of articles recently that were filled with contradictory statements by provincial managers and De Lange. Gauteng police spokeswoman Colonel Athlenda Mathe had said management noted statements to the media by De Lange alleging she didn’t know why she was booted. She said at the time De Lange opted for early retirement. Responding to the early retirement claims, De Lange said she was pushed. Meanwhile, the South African Police Union said an urgent meeting held yesterday between De Lange and national police commissioner, General Khehla Sitole, saw a decision to remove her reversed. This follows a letter written by the union to Sithole on Monday to hold off De Lange’s apparent booting. The union said it was ready to get an urgent court interdict to stop her removal. The People’s Paper tried to get comment from national cops spokesman Vishnu Naidoo. But at the time of going to print, he had not commented. Several calls were made and inquiries were forwarded to Naidoo.
