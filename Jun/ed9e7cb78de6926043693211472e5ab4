Mpumalanga Human Settlements MEC Norah Mahlangu said her department aimed to build 10 986 houses by next year. Mahlangu said this while tabling her budget speech at the legislature last week. She said the department had a projected budget of R1,774 billion. Mahlangu emphasised the need for low-cost houses, mixed housing, community halls, health and educational facilities. She said the department, among other things, had built 8 734 houses, 4 230 serviced sites and 111 disaster houses, and issued 5 030 title deeds during the previous year. “This programme entails township formalisation and installing municipal engineering services infrastructure,” she said. But despite all these achievements, she said, the country as a whole still faced a challenge in providing access to suitable housing for all its citizens. The department’s long-term aim was to enable everyone to have houses and meet their changing needs, said the MEC. She said new ways to finance housing must be found to meet the challenges in the sector.
