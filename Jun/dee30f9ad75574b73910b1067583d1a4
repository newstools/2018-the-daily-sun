SKOLOPAD fainted while dancing at the Samas on Saturday night. The socialite and singer whose real name is Nonhlanhla Qwabe, from QwaQwa in the Free State, later blamed muthi for the incident. Speaking to Daily Sun from Sun City, North West, Skolopad said: “I started having skin problems a few days before the event. “Just after I solved the skin problem, I fainted. I think jealous witchcraft is behind my problems. I was dancing and having fun when everything suddenly went blank. I blacked out and collapsed.” However, Skolopad didn’t want to rule out the possibility that she fainted because of an empty stomach. “I was a little nervous and when I’m nervous I can’t eat. I didn’t have anything to eat because of my nerves. That could also be the reason I fainted. “I was immediately given the necessary medical attention after the incident and I felt better. I was also given a full chicken to eat and I was well again. “ I now have to worry about driving home safely but I’m great again.” Talking about the black see-through dress she wore to the event, Skolopad said she was dressed by LeraV designer Themba Tshabalala and her hair was sponsored by Junior Hair. She urged her supporters not to worry about her health. “I’m a very strong woman and my followers and fans shouldn’t stress about my health,” she said. Skolopad recently consulted the help of psychic medium Cindy Kruger on Fox Life’s Spirit show, where she communicated with her late family members, including her gogo.
