JOB seekers on Tuesday gathered at Hluvukani in Mpumalanga for the Unemployed Youth Workshop. The workshop was organised by Mpumalanga Public Works MEC Sasekani Manzini. She said the main object of the workshop was to empower the youth with skills and the knowledge required to enter the job market. Manzini encouraged the youths to take advantage of the job opportunities created by government. “Government can only do so much. Ordinary citizens must ask themselves what they can do to make a difference,” said the MEC. “I have asked the stakeholders present today to a give me a full report on the workshop’s impact.” Some of the stakeholders included the Mpumalanga Economic Growth Agency, Standard Bank and the National Youth Development Agency. “I would like each of them to indicate what they are planning to do for the young people who attended the workshop because information alone cannot change the current state of affairs.” Patricia Mathonsi (21), an unemployed youth, said the information shared at the workshop will help her knock on the right doors.
