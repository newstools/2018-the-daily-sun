RESIDENTS of Hostel 1 in Mangaung are angry. Rubbish is still a problem in their area, even though the Mangaung Municipality sent new trucks last month. The people said the municipality promised to improve services, but they still live in filth. Vuyiswa Nkasa told Daily Sun: “Our municipality promised to improve service delivery after the mayor sent new rubbish trucks last month. “But there’s no improvement at all. “It’s been three weeks and the rubbish has still not been collected. “People now dump their rubbish in open spaces. “What’s even worse is that our kids’ lives are at risk because they play near the rubbish. When we asked municipal workers why they hadn’t collected it, they told us there was a shortage of trucks. “I thougt this was resolved by mayor Olly Mlamleli when he called us to a meeting at Hoffman Square. “He had told us that he’d be sending refuse trucks in the area.” Another resident, Joshua Maine, told the People’s Paper: “Our municipality is a joke. It’s hardly a month since we were promised that services would improve, but we are back to square one. “Our area smells badly because people dump their rubbish everywhere.” Qondile Khedama, a spokesman for the municipality, told Daily Sun: “We hope to resolve the problem soon.”
