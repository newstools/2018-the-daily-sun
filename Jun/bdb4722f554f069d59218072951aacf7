ACCORDING to Sheila Mbele-Khama, the violation of graves has increased dramatically. Mbele-Khama is the chairwoman of the commission for the protection of cultural communities. She told the media that a number of cases were found during a week-long visit to Mpumalanga. She said in Mpumalanga and Limpopo, graves were often removed by farmers and developers who did not consult the families of the dead. “We have decided to have a national hearing on graves, since we have received many complaints about graves being destroyed. “It causes many challenges when Africans do not have access to their loved ones,” she said. “There is a tendency of digging up graves and throwing the remains wherever. People lose their history. “We still need to follow up with farmers and developers who have done this to find out what really happened. “We have found that nobody wants to take accountability, but we will not stop. “We will investigate until we close cases so people will understand what really happened.” Members of the Ngubeni family told Daily Sun they had lost four graves on a farm. Mandla Ngubeni said: “We want to gain access to the farm and identify our graves as they have allegedly been removed. “We appeal to the commission to assist us to find our loved ones and rebury them.” Mbele-Khama said there were cases where farmers removed graves after buying land. Mbele-Khama said the commission was investigating 400 complaints and would return to the province after they were done with the investigation.
