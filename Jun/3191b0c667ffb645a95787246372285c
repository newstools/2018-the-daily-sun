THE people of KwaBhaca near Mount Frere, Eastern Cape, have once again been warned about buying expired goods. Municipal officials, environmental health practitioners and cops searched through shelves and storerooms at a number of shops. Mayor Bulelwa Mabengu said: “This ongoing campaign has helped save people from being victims of food that’s beyond its sell-by date. “I’m especially concerned about products that are put on sale when the expiry date is less than a week away. “By the time the person finishes the mealie meal, it would have expired a long time ago.” They also checked the validity of stores’ trading licences. Among products found to have expired were soft drinks, tea bags and snacks. Store owner Naweed Mohamed said they welcomed the visit by the municipality. “We don’t want to lose business and customers,” he said. “When people find something wrong in your store, they tell others. That’s bad for business.” Alfred Nzo environmental health practitioner Bulelwa Nokhwe said it was their job to check the quality of food. “We check on expiry dates, as well as dented tins and rusted and damaged goods,” she said. “We discuss the matter with shop owners and ask to destroy expired products at our landfill site.” She said they had a problem with shop owners taking stock back to the supplier.
