PRINCESS Dada claimed while she was nursing her sick mum, had her RDP taken away and given to somebody else by a councillor! She said her mum was in hospital in Umzimkhulu, southern KZN, when the houses were being officially handed over. The 36-year-old from KwaNdlazi in Lindelani, northern KZN, was excited to get a house after living in a shack for 10 years. But when she returned home in December 2016, she was bitterly disappointed. She told Daily Sun ever since then she’d been fighting with the Human Settlements Department, seeking justice. “I applied for the house in 2013. I was given the RDP number that same year and told to wait, along with other residents who’d registered. “When the houses were finished in 2016, the councillor confirmed to my brother Nhlanhla that mine was ready. “She even gave him my keys and documents, but when I came back I found another woman living in the house.” Princess had apparently asked the woman what was going on, and the woman had said the councillor gave her permission to move in. “I questioned the councillor and she said people had told her I was not a resident,” she said. Whenever she asked the department for details, officials had told her their system showed she’d been allocated a house already. Councillor Gloria Mhlongo said: “Our investigation proved Princess doesn’t live here, which disqualifies her from benefitting from the project.” She said the woman who got the house had been renting for over 30 years. The SunTeam sent an email to human settlements spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi on Monday morning, but he hadn’t responded at the time of going to print.
