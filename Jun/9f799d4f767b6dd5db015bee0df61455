THE price of a
litre of petrol in Mzansi is already in record territory,Â  but motorists can expect to pay more than R16
per litre. Motorists
currently have to pay R15.20 and R15.79 for a litre of 95 octane unleaded
petrol on the coast and inland. "Since the
start of June, the rand has steadily weakened against the US dollar, with the
average cost per dollar having climbed from around the R12.50/$ mark to nearly
R13.00/$," The Automobile Association (AA) said in a statement. The AA says fortunately,
international oil prices retreated over the same period and have had a very
small impact on the figures. "The
current data forecast a rise of around 32 cents a litre for petrol; 30c for
diesel; and 22c for illuminating paraffin." In June, both
grades of petrol 93 and 95 increased by a large 82c a litre, while Diesel 0.05%
sulphur and diesel 0.005% sulphur increased by 85c and 87c a litre. Illuminating
paraffin (wholesale) went up by 82c, while illuminating paraffin (SMNRP) cost
109c more per litre.
