A DUMP site became the scene of chaos yesterday as Metro cops and scrap collectors clashed. The Durban Metro cops arrived to chase scrap collectors away from a dump in Sydenham, but they refused to go. Cops allegedly fired warning shots and the collectors responded by throwing rocks back at them. Three collectors were left lying on the road with injuries. The stand-off left the Metro cops’ van severely dented, too. According to a police source, the scrap collectors steal from the back of trucks and bakkies driving past. “Cops arrived to remove them from the area and started by asking them to leave. They then fired warning shots, but the scrap collectors threw stones at them,” said the police source. He said the scrap metal collectors only backed off when cops started shooting at them and they saw people had been injured. Scrap collector Nsimbi Sibisi (45) told Daily Sun the cops opened fire without warning and they were forced to defend themselves by throwing stones. “We have been collecting metal in this area for several years and we do not bother or steal from anyone,” he said. “We did not do anything wrong, but the cops started shooting at us. We don’t know what we did to deserve this violence.” He said the injured people were rushed to hospital. Metro Police Senior Superintendent Parbhoo Sewpersad said: “Metro were attacked. Seven people were injured and three police cars damaged.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said three attempted murder cases were opened. Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said they were investigating the incident.
