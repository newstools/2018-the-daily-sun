Tanzanian conjoined twins Maria and Consolata Mwakikuti
have died at the age 21 after suffering respiratory complications at a local
hospital. The women, who were joined from the navel downwards and
shared organs like the liver and lungs, had two hearts and separate heads and
arms. The BBC reports that they were admitted to hospital in
December due to issues relating to heart disease but died on Saturday. The twins were popular in Tanzania and the news has
caused sadness nationwide.  Many people took to social media on Sunday to send
messages of condolence to the family and friends. Tanzanian President John Magufuli tweeted that he was
"saddened" by their deaths, adding that Consolata and Maria had
"dreamed of serving the nation". In an interview with the BBC last year, the twins said
that after they had completed their university education, they wanted to become
teachers. "We will teach using a projector and computers,"
they said.
