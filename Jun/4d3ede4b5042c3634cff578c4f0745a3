THEY are happy that the United Nations has declared their condition as a disability. But they feel there are still many more hurdles to climb. This emerged during the march organised by the KZN Albinism Society yesterday. The march started from King Dinuzulu Park to Durban City Hall. It was in line with commemoration of the International Albinism Awareness Day, which is celebrated annually on 13 June. The chairman of the organisation in KZN, Maxwell Thabethe, said the issue of their safety was still a huge challenge. “It is known that people with albinism fear for their lives as they are hunted like wild animals. It is very disturbing that sometimes when we go to the police stations to report suspicious things the cops tell us to bring proof,” said Thabethe. “This is the sad reality and everybody has heard about people with albinism being kidnapped or found dead with parts of their bodies missing.” He mentioned examples such as the killing of Thandazile Mpunzi in Hluhluwe, KZN, in August. “Sibusiso Nhatave also disappeared after school in Mkhobose in Empangeni in June 2011 and has never been found. “These are some examples that prove we are not safe.” Thabethe said a two-day summit will be held with government officials as well as the private sector to discuss how people can intervene to protect people with albinism. Councillor Nompumelelo Ntshangase from eThekwini Municipality said: “We will continue talking to them to ensure that people with albinism live in a safe and secure environment.”
