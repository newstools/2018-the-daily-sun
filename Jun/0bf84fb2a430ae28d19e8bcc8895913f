EKURHULENI cops have arrested three members of the “Rolex
gang” following a shootout on the R25 in Modderfontein on Tuesday. The suspects were allegedly found in possession of a hijacked
car. According to the cops, they were conducting surveillance on
the suspects since the hijacking of a vehicle in Alexandra in May 2018. When the suspects realised that they had been cornered, they
started shooting at the police. “Three suspects were arrested at the scene, with one
sustaining injuries. The vehicle, two handguns with ammunition and other items
were seized,” Acting National Commissioner Lieutenant General Sindile Mfazi
said. Mfazi said combating car hijackings, as a category of the
trio crimes, is one of SAPS’s top priorities. “This collaborative effort of various law enforcement
agencies will, going forward, be incorporated in the normalisation approach
that will ensure the sustainability of low levels of serious crime.” “I am pleased with the integrated approach towards the fight
against serious and violent crime. It is evident that when we coordinate our efforts, we will
emerge victorious against the scourge of aggravated robberies,” The National
Head of the DPCI, Lieutenant General Godfrey Lebeya said.
