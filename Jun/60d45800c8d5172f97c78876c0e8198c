THE Constitutional Court has upheld the high court ruling on reporting sexual offences. The law previously did not allow sexual abuse victims to lay criminal charges 20 years after the abuse. This ruling relates to a case dating back to the 1970s. That has all changed, a ruling in the Johannesburg High Court in 2017 declared Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Act unconstitutional, and invalid. The case that changed all of this was started by eight men and women who filed a civil lawsuit in 2013 against businessperson and socialite Sidney Frankel. The group accused Frankel of sexually abusing them as children. Frankel died in April 2017. An abused person will now be able to report the sexual offence to the police, no matter how long ago it happened... The Hourt Court suspended the order of invalidity, and gave Parliament 18 months to change the wording of the section of the law, so that it will allow the NPA to consider prosecuting all sexual offences, regardless of how long ago they happened. There were three friends of the Court (Lawyers for Human Rights, Womenâ€™s Legal Centre and the Teddy Bear Clinic) in this case and the applicants were represented by private attorneys.
