MICHAEL Ncana (47) was getting ready to work in his garden yesterday morning when he made a horrible discovery. “I was planning to cut the weeds in the yard when I saw this horrible thing.” What Michael saw was an adult woman’s bloodstained panties right in front of the door at his house at Tshepisong phase 2 in Krugersdorp, Mogale City. “I called my wife and she nearly cried when she saw them. Why was our yard chosen out of so many yards in the area?” Agnes Ncana (42) said they had no idea how the bloody panties landed up in their yard. “This is upsetting. Why would anybody do something like this to us? We haven’t done anybody any harm,” she said. “This is just pure evil.” Some neighbours thought somebody was bewitching the family while others say maybe the panties were a cry for help from an abused woman. A neighbour asked: “What if it was a woman trying to ask for help?” Traditional healer Dungamanzi Mtsimbini of Wattville, Ekurhuleni said the family must not relax. “The panties were put there by someone with evil intentions,” he said. “That family is being bewitched. They fight sometimes and it’s because of the bad spirits in their yard. They must get a traditional healer or a sangoma who will undo everything that’s happened to them.” He said people probably want them to abandon their house so they can take it. “They must fight back against the evil,” said Dungamanzi.
