GOGO Regina Radebe’s life hasn’t changed – she’s still renting a mud house and it seems her life won’t change anytime soon. The RDP she was promised by a councillor and the Msunduzi Local Municipality hasn’t been built yet. And local ward war room members claimed the councillor had told them to stop meddling. The 79-year-old from Copesville in Pietermaritzburg first told Daily Sun she was profiled by the war room. And the councillor visited her earlier this year and promised her the RDP would be handed over to her on 10 April. On 11 May, Daily Sun reported that the councillor was denying he promised gogo a house, claiming h e only found out about her in a newspaper. War room secretary Siphumelele Ndlela confirmed that they profiled gogo Regina and told the councillor she deserved an RDP. “After Daily Sun published her story, we decided to attend to her matter,” he said. “In our meeting with the councillor, he told us he’d handle gogo’s matter and to stay away. He threatened to dissolve the committee.” Gogo Regina said the thought of renting a house at her age frustrated her. “It’s clear that I will die here. I don’t know why it’s so hard for the municipality to build a house for me.” Msunduzi spokeswoman Thobeka Mafumbatha had no knowledge of gogo’s matter. Her response differed from the one she made last month: that gogo Regina’s matter was being handled by the Human Settlements Department. Councillor Spha Madlala confirmed that he’d told war room members he’d handle gogo Regina’s matter. “I’ve forwarded the matter to the department and I hope she’ll get her house soon,” said Madlala. Human settlements spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi said after Daily Sun contacted them, they addressed the matter. “Everything is in place and we referred the matter to the municipality, which was going to find the site for her RDP. “We don’t know what the cause of the delay is. Regina’s house should’ve been built by now. I’ll check with the municipality.”
