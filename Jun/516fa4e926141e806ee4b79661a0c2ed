A FAMILY of seven is living in fear of their lives after their house was set on fire on Monday. The family from Lusaka in Amaoti, KZN are in hiding, believing angry residents torched their house. Family member Aron Mlangeni (33) said he heard people were coming to burn their house. He said he phoned his gogo Khanyisile Mlangeni (82) and told her people were coming to burn the house. “Gogo panicked. She was alone in the house, so she went to hide with our neighbour.” “The residents came and stoned our Quantum, burnt our home and everything in the house. “Fortunately, gogo wasn’t injured.” He said they heard residents burned the house because his brother Zakhele (30), arrested for the murder of neighbour Makhehla Zulu (81), was released on bail. “Zakhele was arrested on Friday. “The Ntuzuma Magistrates Court released him on R1 000 bail on Monday. “They were angry because he was released,” he said. “The people shouldn’t have involved us. We don’t even know why they said my brother killed Makhehla.” He said the family members, including his brother, are in hiding because they fear for their lives. A resident said Makhehla was found dead at his house two weeks ago. “Some people saw the suspect leaving the house at night and the next day, he was found dead. “People were angry about his release. “Makhehla had no one. “That’s why we are fighting for him,” said the resident. KZN cop spokesman Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of arson is being investigated at Inanda Police Station after a house was set alight. Zwane also confirmed that a suspect was arrested on Friday for Makhehla’s murder. “He appeared in court on Monday and was released on bail,” Zwane said.
