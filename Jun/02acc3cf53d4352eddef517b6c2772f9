Ayanda Gcaba’s agent Mike Makaab of ProSport International says they are working around the clock to make sure the defender gets a new club before the 2018/19 season resumes in August. The former Bafana Bafana will see his contract with Orlando Pirates come to an end this month and Makaab has confirmed that Gcaba won’t be going back. Said Makaab: “We’re working hard on this, trying to make sure he gets a new club sooner rather than later. “Right now, I can’t be specific about the club, but what I can say is we’re looking at all opportunities for him. “But I can confirm that he’s not going back to Orlando Pirates.” The 32-year-old Gcaba, who joined Pirates from Free State Stars in 2012, spent the second half of the season on loan at Platinum Stars, who have since been relegated to the National First Division. Gcaba is one of many players in the said exodus of players making their way out of Pirates. Before joining Dikwena during the January transfer window, the Port Shepstone-born was reportedly wanted by AmaZulu. But Makaab was mum when asked whether Usuthu had come back to them now that his client was a free agent. “Like I said before, we’ll look at all the opportunities,” he said. The going got tough during Gcaba’s last season with the Soweto giants after the return of coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic, who had his own preferred players in his position at centre-back and at left-back. Mthokozisi Dube played most of the games at centre-back and the return of Innocent Maela from his loan spell at Thanda Royal Zulu also spelled disaster for Gcaba and other two natural left-backs, the likes of Thabo Matlaba and Marc Van Heerden. Matlaba and Van Heerden also face uncertain future at Bucs and are reported to be also on their way out of the Mayfair outfit.
