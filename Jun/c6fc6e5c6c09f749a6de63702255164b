A VIDEO of a man posing with what is believed to be about R4,3 million in cash has tongues wagging, but the businessman, Eugene Silinda, was left stunned and shocked by what he calls the cruelty of some individuals. The video was posted on social media by a user who calls himself “The Man’s Not Barry Roux”. The caption read: “This is Eugene Silinda, a businessman, who also has tenders with government. He’s very stupid, why such a video?” He suggests that Silinda will now be investigated, even by SARS. In the video, Silinda says the money is the result of hard work. He says people are tired of all the “boys” who claim to be working hard while posting only R10 000. “If we were posting, you would not dare post again - but we don’t. We are quiet, watching you make fools of yourselves,” Silinda says. Speaking to Daily Sun, he said he was hacked. The video had been on his phone for quite a while, but it was “proof for myself that I once lived”, he said. “The money is legit. I run legitimate businesses and all my sources of income are legit.” He said business would not allow him to post something like this. “I have never posted even a R100 note on social media.”
