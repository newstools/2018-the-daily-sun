EMERGENCY services workers were on their way to save a life when they were almost killed themselves. They were rushing to respond to a patient in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, when a taxi smashed into their ambulance from the back. Emergency services spokesman Daine Jones said they received a call at about 5pm on Tuesday to say two members were injured in an accident. “We were told the accident took place on Chris Hani Road in Vosloorus. We rushed to the scene to find a taxi had crashed into the ambulance from the back. The taxi rolled over and smashed into a BMW, which crashed into another car,” he said. Jones said no one died but the members had to be rushed to hospital for their injuries to be treated. “Two of our members were injured, the driver and an assistant. We are glad there was no patient in the van. “Imagine a sick person also getting injured. We are happy everyone is alive,” he said.
