TALENTED Banyana Banyana striker, Melinda Kgadiete, has vowed continue with the form she displayed during the Sasol League National Championship in December when she plays for the national team. The talented Bloemfontein Celtic Ladies FC forward caught the eye of head coach Desiree Ellis during the tournament in Mpumalanga, where she helped her side defend their title by contributing five goals. She was then drafted into the Banyana squad in January when they played friendly matches against Sweden in Cape Town. Since then she has been slowly cementing her place in the squad although she has yet to score her first goal in national team colours. The Eastern Cape-born player aims to shine in the absence of overseas-based players this afternoon when Banyana play their opening 2018 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations qualifier against Lesotho at Setsoto Stadium in Maseru (3pm). Banyana need to win the two-legged qualifiers to qualify for the Women’s Afcon scheduled for Ghana from 17 November to 1 December. Kgadiete says she wants to start scoring: “As a striker I need to score goals because I want to be selected again in future. “Not putting pressure on myself, but I was selected to score goals after impressing the coach. I have played five or six games and have not scored yet, and that is not a good record for a striker. “Attacking players such as Thembi (Kgatlana) and Linda Motlhalo are not in the team, so I better start scoring so that when they come back they will have some competition.” She cautioned that Banyana shouldn’t underestimate the Mountain Kingdom’s team despite them being ranked below the South Africans. “Our World Cup quest starts with them. If we can’t beat them we are not going to see France next year,” stated Kgadiete. To book their spot at the 2019 France World Cup, Banyana need to qualify for the Women’s Afcon and then finish in the top three in Ghana later this year.
