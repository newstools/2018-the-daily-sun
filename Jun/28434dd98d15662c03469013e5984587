WATER and sanitation got the biggest slice of the cake during the presentation of the Alfred Nzo municipal budget. Mayor Sixolile Mehlomakhulu delivered his state of the municipality address at an open day council at Masomntwana Village, near kwaBhanca, on Wednesday. Mehlomakhulu said he aimed to have a more capable and financially stable municipality in the next financial year. “R510 million was set aside for water and sanitation. People in all our local municipalities have taken to the street to protest for municipal services, especially water. “We have decided to deal with this issue head-on. As we speak, we have drilled two boreholes in this village to deal with the water supply,” said the mayor. He said R222 million was set aside to implement bulk water supply projects. The municipality is currently under investigation by the Hawks’ special investigations unit for fraud and corruption involving nearly R300 million meant for water projects. He said the allegations only referred to procurement processes as the projects do exist. “Earlier this year Matatiele Municipality was hit by heavy rain. We have subsequently budgeted R35 million for waste water works and the construction of effective stormwater drains,” said Mehlomakhulu. “We sometimes face natural disasters where people are hit by lightning, or homes fall after heavy rain. Some get burnt by runaway fires. R1,8 million is set aside to deal with such disasters.” He said he understood the high rate of unemployment in the district and had budgeted R10 million to deal with it. The municipality would also focus on the economy of the ocean, improving infrastructure, economic development, property development, agriculture and agro-processing. The municipality gave away blankets to elderly people attending the council. Unemployed residents who didn’t qualify for social grants were given groceries.
