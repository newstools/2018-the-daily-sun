A COP from KwaNdengezi, west of Durban, is lucky to be alive. He was ambushed by unknown assailants on Friday. According to KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker, Constable Musawenkosi Khwela (33), who works for the Shongweni K9 unit, was attacked while on his way home. “It’s alleged the constable was returning home in KwaNdengezi at 10pm when unknown assailants opened fire on his vehicle,” said Naicker. “He sustained multiple gunshot wounds and was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. He remains in a stable condition in ICU.” KZN acting police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi condemned the brutal attack on the man in blue. “Every attempt is being made to trace the perpetrators of this heinous crime,” he said. “Those who attack cops will feel the full wrath of the law.” He said perpetrators should look over their shoulders. “We wish our member a speedy recovery, and he will remain in our thoughts and prayers until he fully recovers,” said Mkhwanazi. ) Meanwhile, the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court sentenced murder accused Sandile Mchunu (26) to 15 years in jail on Wednesday. He killed his friend Themba Zondi (23) in May 2016. Naicker said evidence presented by the investigating officer in court led to the accused being successfully prosecuted.
