PAINTING images representing political history is Mduduzi Dzanibe’s passion. The 29-year-old artist from Inanda, KZN said he first started drawing while he was at Shembe Primary School and has never looked back since. He said he left North High School in Phoenix when he was in grade 10 because all the other subjects bored him. He decided to study art and design at Thekwini FET College. “My passion for painting controls me. I don’t see myself doing anything besides drawing and painting. At the moment, I have to work from home as I have nowhere else,” he said. “I choose to focus on political leaders because I believe in remembering the history of our country.” Mduduzi said at his house he had portraits of leaders such as mayor Zandile Gumede, KZN Premier Willies Mchunu, Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda and Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana. He recently painted a picture of late SACP leader Chris Hani, his killers Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus, and his funeral. The painting also shows ANC veteran Tokyo Sexwale, who was the first on the scene after Hani was killed. “It took me two weeks to do the Hani’s painting,” said Mduduzi. “It wasn’t difficult because I like it. I wish I could find a place where I could show off my work and sell it. I also hope to get sponsors.” Mduduzi said he loved South African history and he wanted the next generation to see it in his paintings. “At the moment I’m busy with a painting of Nelson Mandela. This is part of celebrating Tata’s centenary year. I’m doing a historical painting to celebrate his life in style,” he said.
