COPS had a hard time trying to calm angry residents who gathered in large numbers outside the court where a rape suspect appeared yesterday. A 47-year-old man appeared in the Verulam Magistrates Court, north of Durban for a bail application after allegedly raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter, whose mum died five years ago. There was chaos when protesters holding placards tried to push their way into the full courtroom. The suspect was wearing dirty clothes and limping. He had bruises on his face and couldn’t stand properly. His Legal Aid lawyer, Mustaqeem Ameer, told the court his client needed medical attention for injuries to his head, legs, ribs and back. Magistrate Ifraan Khalil postponed the matter to the 25 June for the suspect to see a doctor. “You will remain in police custody until we get your medical report. We can’t release you because of the critical charges you are facing,” said Khalil. He ordered the media not to publish the name of the stepdaughter or her photos. The man was arrested on Sunday after his neighbour apparently found used condoms in his house and questioned the stepdaughter. According to a neighbour, she said her stepfather had been raping her since her mum died. The neighbour told other residents, who caught the suspect and beat him. He was rescued by security guards, who handed him over to the police. The police rushed the suspect to hospital but he escaped on Monday. He was found hiding at a cement factory in Phoenix the next day.
