Iconic South African actress, singer, dancer and TV presenter, Thembi Seete recently gave birth to her first child and has had no problems shedding off that baby fat by the looks of things. The radiant and ageless star showed off her impressive post baby body at a Ponds event recently where she made her first public appearance since giving birth to her child, Dakalo. Known to age like fine wine, the 41 year-old has bounced straight back and looks as gorgeous as ever after her pregnancy which she kept away from the public eye.
