POLICE Minister Bheki Cele says in the last 24 hours, cops have
arrested 13 people linked to cash-in-transit (CIT) heists. Addressing the media on Wednesday afternoon, Cele said they
have arrested 'a so-called kingpin' and the number two of these syndicates. He went on to mention that there is a foreign element in
these crimes. According to Cele over 100 high performance cars have been
purchased, so that those behind the CIT heists will no longer get away. However, Police Commissioner Khehla Sithole says the stolen CIT money
is then washed through other illicit means. He says he won't disclose the number of CIT heist syndicates
in operating in the country, but he said it's more than one and that they will
be bringing them down. Cele told the media that they are slowly but surely finding
out why there's an increase of CIT heists. Meanwhile, he also mentioned these cash heists are not just
heists, but terrorism. He mentioned an innocent teacher that was killed as a result
of a heist. According to Sithole the fire arms used in the heists
can be traced to the SAPS and the army. He further said it does not always mean officials are
involved.
