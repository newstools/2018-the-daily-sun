FORMER Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates striker Siphelele Mthembu is in the dark on whether Absa Premiership side Free State Stars will renew his contract for next season or not. Mthembu joined Stars on a one-year contract last season and it is due to expire at the end of this month. Although the 30-year-old had a great 2017-18 season with Ea Lla Koto, the Free State side’s management have not yet decided what the future holds for him. Mthembu played a crucial role in helping Stars finish the PSL season in an impressive sixth position and also win the Nedbank Cup following a 1-0 victory over Maritzburg United at Cape Town Stadium last month. “My contract with Stars expires at the end of June,” Mthembu confirmed. “But to be honest, I want to continue playing for Free State Stars. I had a good full season here and enjoyed success with the club. “We played as a team, something I haven’t truly experienced to this extent in years. I also enjoyed playing under Luc Eymael.” He admits age is no longer on his side and says he must stop hopping between clubs and secure his future. “For now I will wait to hear what Stars management have to say,” he said. The Melmoth-born hit maker, who has now won all competitions on offer in the PSL, wants to be part of the Stars team that will play in the African Confederation Cup next year. In addition to the Ke Yona victory with Stars, Mthembu won the PSL title and MTN8 while playing for Amakhosi and lifted the Telkom Knockout cup with now relegated Platinum Stars. Mthembu predicts more success for Stars: “I believe we will come back much stronger with Eymael in charge. Luc hates to lose! “He does not want lazy players either. I was fitter this past season than the season before. Even after a game, I don’t feel tired. So I see a great future for me at Stars.”
