MARGRET Nzima (58) stood by helplessly as her four-roomed shack burnt to the ground. The gogo from Mzimhlophe, Soweto said she was only away from her shack for about 30 minutes, visiting a neighbour, when she heard people screaming that her shack was on fire. “I always visit my neighbour after doing my chores for the day,” she said. Margret said she couldn’t understand how the fire started. “I’m shocked because I always switch off all the appliances when I leave the house. “We have a problem with electricity,” she said. “I live with my three children and one grandchild. We have lost everything.” Margret told Daily Sun that all their valuable documents were destroyed. “The furniture we bought recently was burnt,” she said. “We have nowhere to go. We have no relatives around here.” The residents and a team of road workers tried to do all they could to put out the fire but they couldn’t save anything in the house. Kids were seen carrying buckets of water from their homes to give to the elders. “We tried calling the fire fighters but they just kept saying they were coming,” said a neighbour. “We were afraid the fire would spread to other shacks on the property as well as the main house. We are relieved no one was injured,” said a neighbour. By the time the people had finally managed to put out the flames, the firefighters had still not arrived.
