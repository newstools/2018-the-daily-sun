LOCAL TV personality Somizi Mhlongo has threatened to open a case against a woman who called him a K****R on social media. In the Tweet, the woman did not just insult him but also tagged him in the insulting Tweet. The woman not only called him by the word K****R, but also included Somizi's sexuality. Following that Somizi, shared the post on Twitter asking for help in finding the racist woman. The woman then replied to Somizi's post by saying her account was hacked. "This is my account that was hacked. I did not post this tweet and would never make such a remark. I take no responsibly for the view that expressed in that tweet and sincerely apologise for the horrific message that was sent out," she said.
