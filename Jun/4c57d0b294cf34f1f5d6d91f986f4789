A man in his 30's died after he was strangled by a madala in Dube, Soweto, on Friday. The deceased reportedly tried to rob the old man off his cash outside the Capitec Bank. But the strong madala was not going to let his cash go off easily. He reportedly grabbed him by the neck and squeezed until he died. Many people who reacted on Twitter seemed to appreciate what the old man did and said he should not be arrested as it was self defense.
