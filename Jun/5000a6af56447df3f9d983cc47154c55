ACTRESS and singer Lerato Mvelase was looking forward to playing the late kwaito star, Senyaka, in a play. However, the play has now been turned into a musical tribute to the artist, whose real name was Thula Kekana. Lerato told Daily Sun: “Unfortunately that concept was dropped. “It is now going to be a concert where artists will perform Senyaka’s songs. It was going to be interesting to play Senyaka.” The show’s producer, Themba Sithole, said although Lerato was a woman and Senyaka was a man, he cast her because she was very talented. “Initially this was intended to be a play, but we have decided to create a musical tribute. Lerato is able to transform and embody any role she plays,” he said. Senyaka’s death in 2015 was a great loss to the entertainment world. The event, called A Night of Kwaito Moruti With wa Tsotsi’s Friends, will take place on 31 August at the Joburg Theatre in Braamfontein. It will feature a line-up of Senyaka’s friends, who were popular on the airwaves at the height of kwaito. They include Kamazu and Mzekezeke as well as Jairus and Spikiri of Trompies.
