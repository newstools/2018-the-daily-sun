THE family of the four family members murdered in their home have said the killer was given a lenient sentence. Yesterday the Durban High Court sentenced Sanele Makhanya (27) to seven life sentences on four counts of murder and three counts of rape, one of which happened in the Mzila home. He was also sentenced to 95 years in jail for crimes such as attempted murder, robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm. Makhanya and his two friends entered the Mzila family home in G section Umlazi, south of Durban, and shot dead four family members – Sibongile (59), Hlengiwe (32), Mlungisi (31) and Lungisani Mzila (25) – last February. Family member Khulekani Mzila (21) said he was sleeping in the main house when he woke up and noticed two men inside the house and one standing outside. The thugs had just shot his two brothers, who were asleep in an outside room, before getting into the house through the toilet window. They stole cellphones and DVDs. “They shot at my sister, and when my mum screamed they shot her too. “Then they came to the room I was sharing with my sister (27). “They pointed a gun at me and told me to look away while they raped her,” said Khulekani. He said cops were called by their neighbour and they arrived while the suspects were still inside the house. “One got out and started shooting at the cops. Cops shot at him and he died at the scene, while the other two escaped,” said Khulekani. A neighbour (46) had also said the suspects began their shooting spree at a tavern nearby and stole cellphones from people and shot at them before heading to the Mzila family home. However, another family member, Ti Mzila, said: “The sentencing will not bring my loved ones back, but he should have received a harsher sentence. “But we cannot do anything, so we will leave this to God.” KZN cop spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said they hoped that the sentence would bring closure to the family who had lost their loved ones.
