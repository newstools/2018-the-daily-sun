CHANTING villagers on Monday blocked Punda Maria and Josefa Village roads with rocks, branches and whatever they could find. The protesters from the village outside Malamulele, Limpopo, said they were sick and tired of the municipality’s empty promises. Resident Maria Khosa (38) said they’ve had no running water for a year. “We’ve reported this but nothing has been done,” she said. “We’re giving the municipality five working days to fix it, or we’ll shut down the village.” She said villagers drink well water. “The well is drying out. It’s also dangerous to fetch water from the bush.” Grade 10 pupil Matimba Manganyi (21) said: “Sometimes the water in the well runs out and we’re forced to go to school wearing dirty uniform. “We often go to school without taking a bath. Our teachers even complain because we smell. Sometimes we don’t go to school at all.” She said they fetch water in wheelbarrows from neighbouring villages. Collins Chabane mayor Joyce Bila said: “We’re working hard to fix the problem and get two water tankers to the area. We urge pupils to return to school.”
