Distraction Boyz’ Que, real name Thobani Mgobhozi, is about to become a dad for the first time and he is very ‘excited.’ Earlier on in the week, Que’s girlfriend 22 year-old Zinzyswa Mayekiso pretty much confirmed what many had already been suspecting when she posted his photo on Instagram with the caption “Baby Daddy.” Mayekiso has since deleted the post. The pair have been very private with their relationship with neither coming out to make their relationship public. However, after the Instagram post, Que has since confirmed to TshisaLive that they are indeed expecting a baby boy. "I am very happy and excited about being a dad,” Que told the publication. “I feel like everything in my life is coming together and going right at the moment," he added. Distruction Boyz took home the biggest award of the night at the South African Music Awards (SAMAS) on Saturday winning Record of the Year for their hit Omunye, which must have been the cherry on top for Que.
