CHARLTON Rayi believes a dog is truly a man’s best friend. The 78-year-old from Mfuleni, outside Cape Town told Daily Sun he loved his 10 dogs because they protected his family. “These dogs are my friends. When I’m inside, they are the ones who keep bad things outside,” he said. When the SunTeam visited him, the madala explained that anyone who wants to enter his yard must first ask permission or the dogs will attack them. “No one ever just comes in here because my dogs will deal with them. There have been times when I forgot to lock the door but no one ever came inside,” he said. The madala said everyone in his family knew they had to be in the house by 9pm because the dogs were on patrol after that. “They must be home by then so the dogs don’t mistake them for witches or criminals.” Madala Charlton said he always cooked bones, chicken feet and pap for his dogs. The madala said when he lost his wife in 2002, the dogs were there to help him deal with it. “They help me not to think about it too much as they keep me busy. However, they will never fill the space left by my wife.”
