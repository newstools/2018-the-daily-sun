A KEY witness in the Coligny murder case took the stand yesterday. Bonakele Pakisi (28) is the only witness in the case of Matlhomola Mosweu. The 17-year-old was allegedly murdered after being loaded into a bakkie by two farmers who accused him of stealing a sunflower from a field in Coligny, North West, last year. Pieter Doorewaard (27) and Philip Schutte (34) are facing charges of murder, theft and pointing of a firearm. During cross-examination at the North West High Court in Mahikeng yesterday, the defence team attacked Pakisi’s evidence. The witness told the court he was walking on the gravel road near the sunflower farm when he saw a white bakkie stopping and three white men throwing the victim into the back of the bakkie. Pakisi said when they realised they had been seen, the men put the injured Mosweu back and went for him. He said they asked him what he had seen, and threatened him with guns to get into the bakkie. The three men drove to a dam on one of the farms. “They made me drink a bottle of Captain Morgan in one go. I threw up and they made me eat my own vomit. They also made me clean the blood from the bakkie,” said Pakisi. The defence questioned the role of the third man, who has not been named and remains a mystery.
