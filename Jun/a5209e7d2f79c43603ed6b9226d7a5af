NOT many people see having a naked photo of them distributed on the internet as the least of their problems. But for a 39-year-old from Fouriesburg, Free State, arrested on Friday after being accused of rape, kidnapping, human trafficking, extortion, illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition and the pointing of a firearm, that’s the case. The man, who had been seen rubbing shoulders with a top ANC official, had tongues wagging when a naked photo of him spread like wildfire on Facebook. It has now emerged the photo was taken by a Lesotho woman he is accused of luring to his house on Facebook. A woman who claimed to be his ex-wife recently wrote on Facebook: “Be aware!  My ex-husband has been trafficking ladies from Lesotho since 2016.  We have divorced.  Please pass this message on to save many other lives.” Police spokesman Captain Zweli Mohobeleli said the man appeared in the Fouriesburg Magistrates Court on Monday but was not asked to plead. His case was postponed to Monday for a formal bail application.  The woman who took the photo said she became Facebook friends with the man in February and they met in April. She said they went to his house in Fouriesburg, where the alleged crimes took place. The police appealed to anyone who might have a similar criminal complaint against the man to call Bethlehem police on 082 854 7546 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111. ANC Free State spokesman Thabo Meeko said: “I’m trying to call my comrades but I can’t get them on the phone to verify if he is still an ANC member.” EFF regional chairman Shadrack Liphoko said the suspect was not a member of the Red Berets. He said: “We are distancing ourselves from that man.”
