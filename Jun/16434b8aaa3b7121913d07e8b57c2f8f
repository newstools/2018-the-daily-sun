SOUTH Africa’s gross domestic product (GDP) experienced a 2,2% decrease in the first quarter of the year. This was announced by statistician-general Risenga Maluleke in Tshwane yesterday. The GDP is the value of everything produced in a country and is used to measure the stability of an economy. “The manufacturing industry decreased by 6,4%,” he said. Maluleke said decreased production was reported for gold and other metal ores, especially platinum and iron. The agriculture, forestry and fishing industry became smaller by 24,2% and contributed -0,7% to GDP growth. “The decrease was mainly because of a drop in the production of field crops and agricultural products,” he said. The finance, real estate and business services sectors grew by 1,8% and contributed 0,3% to GDP growth. He said household final consumption expenditure, which measures the money a family spends on goods and services, increased by 1,2%.
