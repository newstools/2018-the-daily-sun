PRETENDING to be pregnant, the woman said she was going to give birth somewhere else. She left home in Atlantis, went to Gugulethu in Cape Town and returned three weeks later with a baby! Two-month-old Anoyolo’s mum Nomfundo Maqashu (37), from Kiki Hostels in Gugulethu, met a new “friend” three weeks ago. She told Nomfundo she had left her boyfriend in Atlantis and moved in with an ex-lover who lived nearby. “She came to my house with braai meat and said she wanted to chat.” Nomfundo said on Saturday she went to the shop and left her child with the woman. “I trusted her and didn’t think she would run away with my baby.” When she came back an hour later, the woman was gone and so was her little baby. “When we called her, her phone was off.” Nomfundo said she went to Atlantis, about 60km from Cape Town, the next day to find her baby. “I found her with her family, who were shocked to hear she stole my baby. She sat at a heater with a blanket around her waist, just like someone who has given birth,” she said. “She told her friends she was going to give birth in Khayelitsha. “She even changed my baby’s feed from Nan to Lactogen.” Nomfundo is happy to be reunited with her child. “Don’t trust anyone with your baby,” she advised other mums. “I will never leave my baby with anyone again.” Anoyolo’s dad, Bongani Yaba (55), said they found the suspect at the house of her boyfriend’s sister. “She lied to her boyfriend about being pregnant,” said Bongani. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a 32-year-old woman was bust in Atlantis for kidnapping a baby. “The child was found unharmed and was reunited with her family. Once charged, the suspect will appear in court.”
