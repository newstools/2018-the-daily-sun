AFTER the sound system was stolen from Jabulile Melphahi’s car in April, she went to the police. But when cops didn’t take action, she decided to investigate herself. She found her sound system at Cash Crusaders. The 31-year-old from Lufhereng, Soweto, told Daily Sun she began monitoring all the places where someone might sell her sound system, which cost R6 050. Two weeks ago, her efforts finally paid off when she spotted her amplifier at the store in Protea Gardens. She said she knew it was hers because she had marked it and screws were missing. “I called the Protea Glen cops and was shocked to find the ID of the person who had sold it belonged to my neighbour.” When she went to the neighbour’s house, he was nowhere to be found. “We found his girlfriend, who gave us his number,” she said. “When we called him, he said he had sold it on behalf of a friend.” Jabulile said she invited her neighbour to her house on Saturday so they could resolve the matter, but he didn’t arrive. “His phone has been on voicemail since then.” The manager of the store where the sound system was sold confirmed the incident. He said the items were handed over to the police. “Usually when we buy from clients, we ask them questions to check if the items are not stolen,” he said. “In this case, the seller told us he had taken the sound system out of his car.” Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of theft out of a motor vehicle was opened but no arrest has been made.
