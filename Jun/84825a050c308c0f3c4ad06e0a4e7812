AN armed thug was shot dead during a violent robbery on Wednesday. It is alleged that two men attacked a security guard when his car stopped at a robot in Hammanskraal, Tshwane. Police spokesman Constable Herman Moremi said the two tried to take the guard’s firearm. “The driver managed to withdraw his firearm and shot one of them in the upper body. The other one managed to flee.” Moremi said the victim drove to a safe place and called cops. The police found the thug (31) dead at the scene. “His family came and identified him. They said he was released from prison last month.” Moremi said a case of murder was opened. “No one was arrested, but we are investigating the case and also looking for the other suspect,” he said. He urged residents to come forward with information regarding the wanted man. “If anyone knows who he is, they should go to their local police station and help us with more information.” He also urged motorists to be vigilant at robots. “They must always ensure their car doors are locked and windows are closed at all times when approaching hot spots. “Always be vigilant of smash- and-grab criminals hanging around robots,” Moremi said.
