BACKYARDERS in Khayelitsha’s Greenpoint and Makhaza areas refuse to remove their shacks, despite disputes with the city of Cape Town. After erecting shacks a month ago, they told the SunTeam it’s too late for the municipality now to remove them. Zuko Kwaza (44) from Greenpoint said: “Big townships like Gugulethu were formed through illegal land invasion and are still growing today. We have already built our shacks here and would rather die than leave our new homes.” Police demolished shacks and confiscated building material from Island squatter camp in Makhaza on Wednesday. When the SunTeam visited the area on Saturday, new shacks had already been built in their place. Mkhululi Gladile (50) said: “We helped people to rebuild their shacks. All we want is unity in doing this. “We are tired of renting and, if the municipality destroys our shacks today, where do they expect us to go? “We left the places where we were renting to settle here. “This isn’t temporary anymore. “We desperately need homes,” he said. The backyards have been battling the municipality for some time. On 11 May, Judge Robert Henney issued a court order in favour of backyarders, saying occupied shacks shouldn’t be demolished. He also said no person occupying a structure should be evicted through demolition. Last Monday, mayoral committee member JP Smith said: “Each year, the anti-land invasion unit removes about 15 000 illegal structures or pegs. That figure is standing at over 26 000 for the first four months of this year alone.”
