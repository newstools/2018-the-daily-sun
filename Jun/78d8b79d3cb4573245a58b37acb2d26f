TWO kids burned to death in a Wendy house yesterday morning. Two-year-old Zaynorah and eight-month-old Zaytoon Adams were apparently left alone by their drug addict parents. The little girls’ mkhulu, Herald Adams (65), said his 30-year-old son and his girlfriend were drug addicts. The madala from Colorado Park, Cape Town told Daily Sun: “I have been warning my son about drugs and not taking care of his kids, but he never listened to me. “I don’t feel sorry for my son. I only feel sorry for my grandkids who died because of their parents’ negligence.” Herald said his son came home at about 2am yesterday but left again. “Before he went out, I told him he would end up in jail or get killed because he is using drugs and his girlfriend is not helping at all. “They made a fire earlier and locked the kids in the Wendy house.” Herald said his son was married for six years before he met his present girlfriend. “His wife left him because of his drug addiction. He then he met his girlfriend, who is also an addict,” he told the People’s Paper. He said the neighbours tried to save the kids but it was too late. “Their bodies were burnt beyond recognition.” Theo Layne, a spokesman for the Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service, confirmed two kids died in a fire. Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said a 30-year-old man was arrested and a case of child neglect was opened. “The man is expected to appear in court today. Anyone with information about the incident should contact Constable Francois Jordaan on 076 250 5246.”
