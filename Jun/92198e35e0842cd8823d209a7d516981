FOR seven years, they have been living with an unbearable smell, caused by a burst sewerage pipe. Residents from Mbulwane Village near Ladysmith, in the KZN Midlands told Daily Sun they fear getting sick after seeing district municipality uThukela dragging its feet to fix the problem. Sandile Mona (52) said they realise the problem was a serious health risk for them and their kids. He said they are forced to keep their windows and doors closed all time to keep the smell out. “We can’t remember when last we went outside our houses to enjoy fresh air. Because of this problem, the smell is unbearable. “We reported it to the councillor several times but he keeps telling us the municipality is going to take care of the problem,” Sandile said they were tired of living like pigs. “We’ve been living under these terrible conditions since 2011. What leaves us confused is that municipal workers pass here every day but don’t bother to fix the problem.” Khulekani Msibi (38) said what makes them even angrier is they don’t own flushing toilets. “This sewerage pipe comes from other places but has been our daily nightmare,” said Khulekani. Councillor General Hlubi said he had been to uThukela Municipality several times to report the matter. “They came in 2016 to do a feasibility study and that was the last time we saw them attending to the problem. “Ever since then, they have been quiet,” he said. Municipal spokesman Jabulani Mkhonza said they are aware of the sewage problem in the area. “A feasibility study was conducted and completed. The finding was that about R355 million is needed to repair it. We have not been able to fix it because there is a shortage of funds,” Mkhonza said.
