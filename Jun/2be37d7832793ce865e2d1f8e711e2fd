AS MZANSI geared up for the end of Child Protection Week, a grade 8 pupil was gang raped on Thursday. The pupil (15) from Ackerville, Emalahleni was in a taxi heading home when the incident allegedly took place. The girl’s mum (36) said a taxi driver and his friends drugged the teenager and took her to the bush. “She was the only passenger in the taxi. When she asked to get out, one of the men put a cloth on her nose, causing her to pass out. “When she regained consciousness, she walked straight home. “My daughter saw her aunt at the gate and broke down in tears. “She told her aunt she’d been drugged. “Her aunt took her to a doctor who confirmed she had been raped,” she said. The aunt said when her niece told her she woke up naked in the bush, she knew something was very wrong. “My niece said she couldn’t remember what happened before she was drugged. “She told me the only thing she remembers was that one of the men put a cloth to her nose,” said the aunt. She said her niece is supposed to write her mid-year exams but is too traumatised to do so. “Those rapists have destroyed her future.” Pupils from various schools in the area marched to Emalahleni Taxi Rank on Friday. They demanded that police find the taximan. Local Taxi Association chairman Dan Mahlangu said he is trying to determine whether the driver belongs to his organisation. He said the association will view cameras at the spot where the pupil boarded the taxi. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a case of rape has been opened No arrests have been made yet.
