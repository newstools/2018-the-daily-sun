“WE BELIEVE something could have been done to save this woman’s life if the police and community had acted immediately.” These were the words of Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane at a media briefing outside the family home of Nomsa Maduna in Mofolo, Soweto on Friday. The mum of three was murdered last Wednesday. She was pulled out of a taxi in Mofolo and shot multiple times. Malobane and Gauteng Social Development MEC, Nandi Mayathula-Khoza, visited the Moroka cop shop to be briefed on the progress of the case before visiting the family. The suspect also appeared in court on Friday. Malobane said the victim’s family had told the police they believed her life was at risk. “They even had to remove her from her house in Ennerdale and bring her home to Mofolo to protect her, but unfortunately the perpetrator decided to follow her and take her life,” she said. “If the perpetrator was arrested after all those cases were registered at Ennerdale Police Station, we could have saved her.” Mayathula-Khoza said the family was very traumatised. “We are very sorry this had to happen. Almost every week, there is a young woman who gets killed, there is a child who is raped, abused and killed and we’re saying enough is enough,” she said. Nomsa’s twin brother Themba Mazibuko said all he wanted was for her murderer to rot in jail. Nomsa will be laid to rest next Saturday.
