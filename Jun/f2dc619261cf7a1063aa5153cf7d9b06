THE National Union of Mineworkers wants arbitration hearings for miners who have lost their lives in the line of duty. The union’s general secretary, David Sipunzi, said they wanted a process similar to the Esidimeni hearings after many patients died in the care of unlicensed NGOs. Speaking at the union’s congress at Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, yesterday, Mpunzi said workers didn’t go to the mine to die, but to work for their families. He said there should be compensation for the miners who die in Mzansi’s mines. Sibanye-Stillwater mines has been hardest hit, with the most recent deaths at the mine’s shaft in Carletonville taking place last week. The mine then recorded five deaths, bringing the total figure to 20 this year. This comes after the miners allegedly went to a closed off area, which didn’t have proper ventilation systems. In the Sibanye Beatrice mine in the Free State, over 1000 miners were trapped underground after a seismic event. “It came as a shock to learn the mine couldn’t get over 1000 miners to the surface,” said Sipunzi. He said they were not prepared for any eventualities. According to NUM, mining companies Sibanye and Lonmin have secured worst employer nominations this year. He said according to latest statistics, as of 18 December last year a total of 86 workers have died, resulting in 330 dependants being without breadwinners. Meanwhile, the highly contested positions in the congress are that of president, deputy and secretary-general of the union. Sipunzi is contesting for the position of secretary-general against Mbuyiseni Hibana from the Carletonville region. President Piet Matosa is up against deputy Joseph Montisetse for the union’s top positions. Peter Bailey and Philip Vilakazi are going head to head for the deputy president position.
