Mzansi DJ, record producer and Gqom music pioneer DJ Tira has a keen eye for talent and has helped unearth a lot of it in the past. DJ Tira whose real name is Mthokozisi Khathi, has helped bring superstar names such as Big Nuz, Destruction Boyz, DJ C'ndo and DJ Fisherman to the fore. The Makoya Bearings, as he is also known, is now looking for new talent to help launch their careers. The 40 year-old Afrotainment kingpin took to social media recently to call on all talented artists to show him what they're capable of and he might just make their dreams come true. "Nothing makes me happy like helping another person! I feel like launching another persons career this year. Where are my talented brother and sisters?," He tweeted. Needless to say, a couple of hopefuls left some of their best work for DJ Tira to listen to in the hope that one of them will be the next best thing.
