A NIGERIAN musician, actor and comedian has declared
himself devoted to a sex doll named Tonto Shaa. According to media reports, Benjamin Nwachukwu – known to
his fans as Shuga Shaa – has been very public about his new babe, taking her on
dates to the movies, to the mall, and cruising on the streets of Lagos in his
car. Tonto wants for nothing, having both blond and brunette wigs, fancy
fingernails and jewellery. Some critics have accused him of just being a lousy
attention seeker, or even a crazy man. But the artist hit back on Instagram: "Why you
people hating on my doll my pet my @tontoh_shaa? I thought dolls are meant to
be taking care of, almost everybody was giving dolls when growing as a child so
what is the problem. “If I decided to give TONTOH a rich treat does that make
me useless or an evil person?” Shuga Shaa told BBC
Igbo that his mum is cool with his new relationship and that wedding bells
are in the air. "Tonto Shaa is a lady and should be treated as
such," Shuga Shaa said. "She gives me peace of mind, zero drama, there is no
chance of suffering a heartbreak from her."
