THEIR trust in the ANC is dying as fast as the cracks grow in the walls of their RDP house. Residents of phase 6 kasi in Mangaung are complaining about their RDPs and live in fear the poorly built structures will kill them. Masabata Khotlele (63) said the community had been unhappy for three years but said politicians were not helpful. Masabata told Daily Sun: “I love the ANC but they don’t keep their promises. They just want our votes.” Limakatso Rakhare (65) said she had lost hope that her house would ever be fixed. “My house was built in 2005 and a year later it started to crack.” Julia Mohlonyane (23) said her parents also tried to get help from officials but they died before anything was done. “The wall surrounding the door is falling apart. I fear we could be buried under the house one day.” Lydia Mokote (42) showed the SunTeam a space where a table spoon could fit in a crack in the wall. And Johannes Lesenyeho (57) said his house started cracking two months after it was built in 2005. Ward 46 Councillor Hoes Ramabolu said: “We have a lot of cracks in RDP houses but we don’t have a maintenance budget. Government has assisted people and they should also take the initiative.” Senne Bogatsu, Human Settlements spokeswoman, said: “We’ll send our engineers and housing technicians to assess the damage.”
