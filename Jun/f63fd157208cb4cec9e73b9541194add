SAFA has made history. For the first time ever, a woman has been appointed to the high profile position of Safa vice president. Ria Ledwaba will serve as one of the four deputies to president Danny Jordaan for the next four years. Along with Xolile Nkompela and Gay Mokoena, Ledwaba was voted into the position at the Safa national executive council meeting held in Polokwane yesterday. It is not the first time Ledwaba, a businesswoman, has been appointed in a position of authority, having been head of Safa’s commercial wing. But this is a bigger, more prestigious position than any other she has ever assumed in her distinguished football career. She was one of four women elected into the all-powerful executive council at the Safa elective congress. By virtue of being PSL chairman, Irvin Khoza occupies the fourth VP position, while Nkompela retained his seat. Nkompela’s appointment was expected, given that he was co-opted as the fourth vice president last year. But the big surprise was the appointment of Mokoena as third VP. Mokoena chaired the finance and procurement committee following his appointment to the Safa executive five years ago. But few would have predicted his elevation to the grandiose vice president position. “It’s a wonderful day for SA football,” said Jordaan. “We welcome four women in the national council, the PSL representative Thabile Msomi, Emma Hendricks, Natasha Tsichlas and, of course, Ria. We are happy with progress made. For the first time in the history of SA football we have a woman as vice president. She had the most votes of the candidates for vice president. “Gay Mokoena was handling the finance portfolio. He did an excellent job. Nkompela is one of the people who made an impact in local football as a leader. He’s dealt with many issues. “And Ria Ledwaba, of course, needs no introduction. She has her own track record in South African football. I look forward to working with all of them,” added Jordaan.
