SOME pastors rob people of their hard-earned cash! And now parliament’s portfolio committee on justice wants to take action. On Wednesday, committee chairman Mathole Motshekga said: “There are religions of the book. If you take so called religions of the book, they say you pay a certain amount you call a tithe. “Leaders of those organisations say members must pay 10% of their earnings. Is that commercialisation of religion?” He said the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities must be invited to parliament to answer these issues. “We have a responsibility to defend the people of this country as 80% of the people are religious,” he said. NFP MP Sibusiso Mncwabe said: “The matter is urgent and it may result in a bad situation. It’s looting of the country in another form.” He said people were free to follow any religion of their choice, but that some pastors took advantage of people. “Yes, we are a Christian country and we don’t discourage people from participating,” said Mncwabe. “But when the looting comes, we must come in and defend our people.” Commission chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said: “I don’t know anything about the invitation. I will find out if anything has been sent to us.” The Hawks recently investigated charismatic pastor Shepherd Bushiri for money laundering.
