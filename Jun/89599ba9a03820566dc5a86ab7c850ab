  HE USED A SELFIE STICK AND TOOK THE COMPROMISING PICTURE HIMSELF! When the image started doing the rounds, people started naming a former politician turned businessman as the man with the selfie stick. Yesterday, Daily Sun spoke to the selfie taker but he insisted the horny man in the picture was definitely not him. He described the picture as disgusting. “I am aware of the allegations relating to the picture that has been circulating. I have seen the picture but it is definitely not me,” he said. He said as he is a businessman, some people may be trying to give him a bad name by involving him in a scandal. “I don’t know what the intention was for the circulation of the picture, but it could be one of two things. “I’m a businessman so someone in my business life may have circulated the picture to destroy me. “It may also be certain individuals in my political rival groups with the intention of tarnishing my name in politics.” There’s no doubt that the picture of the two naked people was definitely taken by the man himself, using a selfie stick. According to sources the image was accidentally put on Facebook by a woman said to be from the Vaal, south of Joburg. The woman later deleted the image from the her Facebook page. Attempts to identify or locate the woman proved fruitless.
