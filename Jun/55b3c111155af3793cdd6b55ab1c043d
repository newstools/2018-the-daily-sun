THABANG Motloung has always lent a helping hand to schools with needy pupils. In his dealings with schools, however, he discovered that pupils were having a hard time expressing themselves. So the 38-year-old from section L in Botshabelo created a debating competition to improve the kids’ communication skills and self-confidence. Thabang, the founder of a non-profit organisation called Motloung Foundation, said many of the kids he worked with were afraid to speak in public. He said the lack of proper communication skills often caused fights among the pupils. “I hate seeing young people engage in pointless quarrels,” he said. He said the idea for his competition was inspired by two young people who were having a discussion about what they learned at school. The conversation made him realise that if more pupils were given an opportunity to speak their minds in public, they would use the platform to share some of their frustrations. Thabang said he has partnered with the Free State education department. “The competition will help pupils to read, write, speak on public platforms and work in teams. “It will also encourage critical thinking and good literacy skills.” The winner of the annual Motloung Foundation school debate competition will walk away with R200 000. The competition is open to pupils in grades 7 to 10. The contestants will be chosen by their schools. Thabang said the competition would be held at the end of the year in Bloemfontein.
