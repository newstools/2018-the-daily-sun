AS CHRISTIANS, they were not happy when their sons were taken to the mountain school without their permission. The parents from Duduza, Ekurhuleni, got together, called the cops, and went to the mountain on Thursday to fetch the seven boys. Cops were called in to accompany the parents. Parents found their kids naked, dirty and smeared with muthi. An angry parent said taking his son to the mountains is against his Christian belief. “I took my son for circumcision at the hospital two years ago,” he said. “I don’t understand why these initiation school owners took my son.” He said his son spent a week in the mountain in Balfour, Mpumalanga, until he was rescued. But another parent said his son was not so lucky. “I found my son had been cut. It was the second time.” The father said he took his son for circumcision when he was 10. “When I got there my son couldn’t walk properly because of this second cut. I had to take him to hospital,” he said. “We wish the law would get tough on these illegal circumcision schools.” Police spokesman Sergeant Harry Manaka confirmed seven boys were kidnapped by illegal initiation schools in Balfour. He said all the boys were rescued but four had to be taken to hospital after sustaining injuries due to cuts. “We’re warning these school owners to stop operating illegally.” Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, chairwoman of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic communitie, said: “Abducting a child and taking him to an initiation school is illegal. “Cops should arrest the culprits and charge them.”
