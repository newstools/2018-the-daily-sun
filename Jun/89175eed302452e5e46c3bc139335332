MZANSI needs blood! The South African National Blood Service is begging everyone to donate blood. In support of the Missing Type international campaign from 11 to 18 June, the SA Blood Service again asked local sports teams, corporations, celebrities and ordinary citizens to donate blood. Silungile Mlambo, chief marketing officer of the organisation, said big companies have the power to encourage people to be blood donors before World Blood Donor Day on 14 June. During the eight day campaign, the service wants organisations to remove the A, B and O from their names for a week to symbolise the missing blood types. “Imagine a life without the letters A, B and O . . . let alone Scrabble! “Come on, CEOs, shed your As, Bs and Os – patients need them more than you do!” Mlambo said the public can get involved by deleting the blood types letters from their social media names and handles. “A South Africa without As, Bs and Os would just be Suth Fric. She said deleting the letters of the main blood groups from your company’s name in your adverts, email signatures and other marketing material is a fun and interactive way to raise awareness of South Africa’s urgent need for new blood donors. Silungile said only 1% of South Africans gave blood regularly. The SA National Blood Service hopes to see more Mzansi people take the initiative to become donors. “It really is critical for us to replenish blood stocks at this time of year because the school holidays are just around the corner. “This will certainly cause a spike in the demand for blood transfusions.” To find out where to volunteer as a blood donor, visit www.sanbs.org.za or call 0800 11 90 31.
