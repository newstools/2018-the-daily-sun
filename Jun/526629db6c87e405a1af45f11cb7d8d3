CASSPER Nyovest has bitten off a little more than he can chew. On Tuesday the rapper became the latest target on social media after he posted a photo of himself on a plane with the caption: “Zzzzzz off to Dubai.” Social media users immediately posted their own versions of the photo. Most poked fun at the mask he was wearing. They mocked Cassper by putting dish cloths, DStv decoders, chicken feet and polony over their eyes. Other users wanted to know how he took a selfie while supposedly being asleep. Zzzzzz off to Dubai.... A post shared by  Refiloe Phoolo ???? (@casspernyovest) on Jun 5, 2018 at 9:16am PDT
