Mzansi is never short of entertaining characters. Even our country's workers always find a way to have some fun in between their hectic work schedules. Last week, two on-duty traffic cops from Kwazulu-Natal took some time off to enjoy a game of hopscotch. But instead of being angry, the people of Mzansi reacted positively to the video. They said there was nothing wrong with some bit of play time and some fun at work. Now on Thursday, construction workers at the Metro Centre Building in Joburg used their work tools for some bit of fun. In the video, three workers used their three wheelbarrows for some bit of fun at work. The two workers are seen seated on the wheelbarrows and pushing the ones in the front while the third one pushes from the back. The video was captured by Tinyiko Barbara Ngobeni who wrote: "Am sitting in my office minding my own business then I see this... Lol."
