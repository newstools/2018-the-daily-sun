ANCYL presidential candidate Victoria de Beer visited Prophet Mboro’s Incredible Happenings Church in Katlehong yesterday. De Beer is one the people who have put their names down to replace current president, Collen Maine, at the elective conference happening in September. The conference was expected to take place this month, but the league decided to postpone it to September. De Beer will have to beat front runners – business man Reggie Nkabinde and Thanduxolo Sabelo – to become the league’s first woman president. The league has been criticised for being nothing but former president Jacob Zuma’s mouthpiece during Maine’s time. De Beer said she has been inspired by the spirit of the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. She said she wanted the league to be at the forefront of fighting for the youth and not a tool to fight individual fights. Prophet Mboro told her she was already a winner just for entering the race. “You had the courage to enter. You know what you want, your purpose, you are doing something to fulfil your purpose,” the prophet said. “I hope you don’t change when you get elected. I hope you are not in it for the money or the fame.” Mboro also warned her against the trend of politicians using the church for their own cause. “They come here and we pray for them. When they get elected they forget about us. “They forget about the people who put them there. I hope you are not one of those politicians,” said Mboro.
