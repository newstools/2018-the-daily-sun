FELLENG Tsholo works hard to get her son to pass his grade 4 midyear exams. “Kutloano struggles to learn,” said the mum of two from Pimville in Soweto. He was given some learning materials before the exams started on 4 June. The mum is pushing him to do well up until the exams finish on 18 June. Cindy Glass, co-founder and director of Step Up Education Centres, said: “Generations of people have passed their exams on anxiety and dread.” But this is wrong. Here are her simple tips to help children write exams. Exams are exciting challenges Teach your kids to treat exams as an exciting challenge. It also makes them less scared when they need to write them. Get organised! Before a study session, decide what needs to be covered and how much time is needed. Also make sure that all learning materials are available and ready before the study session begins. Celebrate all progress Even failure shows children their weak spots Active studying We are seven times more likely to remember information if we write it while studying. Set achievable goals Start with the easy tasks first and do more challenging ones later on. Give it your best shot Teach your child to do their best in everything in life. Study buddy Be interested in your child’s progress. Admire their discipline and excellence. Children will do what you do, not what you tell them to do.
