A TEENAGE boy’s mum is sick with worry because he’s not returned home after going to fetch a puppy. Newlands West Secondary School pupil Ngcebo Sekhosana (15) from KwaMashu J section, north of Durban, left home on Wednesday afternoon with two unknown boys. His mum Mathabiso (35) said when Ngcebo returned from school, he was accompanied by two strange teen boys. “He told me and his older brother the boys were selling him a puppy and he was going to fetch it as he’d already paid for it. He left with them.” At 7pm she called him on his cell, which rang inside the house. “I went to search for him at my neighbour’s house, but no one had seen him.” She said Ngcebo’s friend also hadn’t seen him in the area. “No one knew the boys who sold him the puppy. The next day I went to his school, but he wasn’t there.” On Friday they went to search for him in hospitals, mortuaries and around KwaMashu but couldn’t find him. She’s worried something bad might have happened. “He’s not a mischievous child,” she said. “Maybe the boys he went away with have something to do with his disappearance. “But we can’t trace them as no one knows who they are. I still hope to find him alive.” Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “Cops are looking for him. Any one with information should call the police on 031 504 9850”.
