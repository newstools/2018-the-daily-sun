ON Saturday a group of residents from Mapoteng in Kathu, Northern Cape, demanded that foreigners leave their kasi, claiming their businesses were just fronts for the sale of drugs. About eight foreign-owned salons and spazas were closed by members of the community. Resident Kgosi Motlae said: “My teenage son told me he bought drugs from them. “They must leave our kasi.” Mmaphefo Molwagae, who worked at a foreign-owned business, (27) said: “These people are not drug dealers. “They are making their money legally.” She said the community asked foreigners for donations to buy sjamboks. “Now those sjamboks are being used against them.” She said the threats have forced some foreigners to sleep outside cop shops. “We cannot accommodate them because we are afraid our house will be burned down. “I have a family to feed but because of this I haven’t been paid.” Businessman Youcef Allebon, who is originally from Pakistan, said residents had forgotten that foreigners helped them to buy sjamboks. “I was kicked and beaten by a group of residents who entered my shop in search of drugs,” he said. “They didn’t find anything. I can’t go back and get my stock because they are going to kill me. “I don’t know anything about drugs as I have never used them.” Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock said 20 foreigners sought shelter and protection at Kathu Police Station. He said although members of the community accused the men of selling drugs, no charges had been laid. “Police management, the mayor, municipal manager and Human Rights Commission officials held a meeting regarding the situation,” said Kock. “A follow-up meeting is scheduled for today. “No injuries or damages have been reported. Police are monitoring the situation.”
