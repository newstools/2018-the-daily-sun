THE North West High Court was a hive of activity on Monday when nine senior police officers linked to the Marikana massacre made an appearance. The accused included former North West deputy police commissioner General William Mpembe (56). Mbempe and eight senior police officers are accused of lying to the Farlam Commission of Inquiry when they claimed the miners had died in hospital. They face four counts of murder, six of attempted murder, defeating the ends of justice as well as contravening the Commission and Independent Police Investigative Directorate acts. Mpembeâ€™s co-accused are retired Colonel Salmon Vermaak (53), Constable Nkosana Mguye (38), warrant officers Masilo Mogale (49) and Katlego Sekgweleya (39), as well as Khazamola Makhubela (49). The top cops have also been blamed for the deaths of police officers Tsietsi Monene Sello Lepaaku as well as mine workers Thembelakhe Mati, Semi Jokanisi and Phumzile Sokhanyile. The case has been postponed to 14 September. The accused are out on bail. Members of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) protested outside the court. They were attending the trial of mine workers who are facing 26 charges. One of the charges is for the murder of a security guard and other non-union members during Lonmin mine unrest in 2012. Their case was postponed to 4 February, as their defence has applied for the charges to be dropped.
