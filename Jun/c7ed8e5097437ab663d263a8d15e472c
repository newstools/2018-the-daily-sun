South African internet sensation turned radio and TV personality, Lasizwe Dambuza has once again been accused of being unoriginal. After several YouTubers accused him of being a copycat in the past, another one has now come out to make the same accusations. American YouTuber, Jay Versace is the latest online star to claim that he has fallen victim to Lasizwe’s content theft. This after Lasizwe posted his latest video titled “That one friend who doesn’t answer” which is about the frustration that one experiences when their friends don’t answer their video calls. “Boy you copy everything I do,” Jay said to Lasizwe, which began a mini spat between the two online stars. “I don’t..., but it’s flattering to know that you follow everything that I do,” Lasizwe said in response. But Jay has had enough and was not backing down this time. “I don’t know anything about you. [People] keep sending me your corresponding flop ass videos. [You’re] making money off other people’s shit and that’s fucked up. Dig in that big funky ass head of yours and find some of your own shit to post. I’m no longer entertaining this goodbye,” Jay said. Lasizwe quickly realized that he wasn’t going to win this fight so he chose to respond to the American star in Zulu. The fight has led to many South Africans tweeting about how much of an “embarrassment” Lasizwe is to the country, distancing themselves from him and even agreeing that his content really is unoriginal. How does Lasizwe steal content and still not be funny ?? pic.twitter.com/jNyOkQIl8V Lasizwe is a prime example of how your lies, creative theft and clownery come back to bite. When we called him out, you guys told us we were being snaacks, haters and “stopping bags”.
