DURING winter we always see an increase in the number of fires in squatter camps and built up areas. The fires are often difficult to reach and result in injuries and death. Over 100 people were left homeless after a fire broke out in the Denver informal settlement near Jeppe last month. An elderly woman in her 80s lost her life. A massive blaze broke out in Taiwan squatter camp in Khayelitsha, Cape Town on 7 May, leaving eight people dead and 22 others homeless as a result. Three children died when the shack they were sleeping in caught alight at Spooktown squatter camp in Bekkersdal, Mogale City recently. Joburg Emergency Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said last year during this season, EMS responded to about 242 fire incidents in Joburg squatter camps. He said in most of the incidents, young children are left alone at home to look after other young children. They are also given the responsibility of cooking for themselves. For this reason, Joburg EMS has launched a winter safety campaign. Mulaudzi advised residents to move out of any burning building immediately and make sure everyone in the building was safe. Residents were urged to do all they could to prevent fires and call emergency services if a blaze erupted.
