THAPELO Masilela claimed he was assaulted by cops for no reason. The 30-year-old from Senthumole squatter camp in Reagile, North West said he was on his way to work last Monday when he ran into an angry group of cops. He told Daily Sun he wasn’t aware there was a service delivery protest in nearby Reagile kasi. “The cops asked me where I was going because there was a violent protest in the area,” said Thapelo. “They then started kicking and punching me before throwing me into the back of the police van. “They drove with me to one of the intersections where residents had been burning tyres. “The cops said I was one of the people who burnt the mayor’s house. I didn’t know anything about the protest. “They made me stand next to a burning tyre while kicking and punching me. “They then pushed me into the fire and I landed on my hands.” He said he managed to escape the brutality by running away. He was badly burned and called his mum to get a car to take him to hospital in Swartruggens, where he spent a day. Thapelo later opened a case of assault against the police. “Had I known that there was a protest, I would have stayed home,” he said. Thapelo said he wanted justice and would be able to identify some of the cops who attacked him. North West police spokeswoman Sergeant Kelebogile Moleko said: “The assault case was transferred to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate for investigation.”
