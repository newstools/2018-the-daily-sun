MOROCCAN Yassime Ghallam (34) received an unpleasant welcome to Mzansi. The bicycle that he has ridden across Africa was stolen on Friday while he was at prayers in Jeffreys Bay, in the Eastern Cape. Yassime Ghallam (34) said he walked from Morocco to Senegal and then rode his bike for over 23 500km to Mzansi. It took him 13 months travelling down the west coast to reach South Africa at the beginning of last month. Yassime told Daily Sun he was heartbroken. “I am very sad because I lost something precious. “I think of my bike as my companion,” he said. Ghallam is writing a book about African culture, food, lifestyle and languages. “My dream is to see the whole world,” he said. “The day will come when Africans will have a single passport, like citizens of one country. “We will move freely from northern Morocco to South Africa. “Africa will become an advanced continent. Yassime said: “I came on my journey without money. “Every day I lived with the local people in the villages and ate with them. A lot of people helped me. I love the openness of the people of Africa. “They are tolerant and dignified people who love peace and welcome all religions and cultural groups.”
