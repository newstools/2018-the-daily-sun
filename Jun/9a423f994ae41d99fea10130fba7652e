HELP is at hand for the residents who have been choking on the smell of kak for weeks at a time. Septic tanks overflow onto the streets of their kasi of Joe Slovo in Cofimvaba. The tanks leave everything in sickening sewage filled pools. The situation has become so bad that even ambulances are unable to come to the rescue of injured or ill residents. Fundile Mdutyulwa, chairman of Cope in the Intsika Yethu told Daily Sun: “The area has suddenly become a haven of hardened criminals as the police cannot come to arrest them. “The less said about our small children who are exposed to all sorts of deadly diseases as they play in the muddy streets, the better. Government has failed us.” Silulami Mpephela (48) said he had to watch helplessly as his business went bust. “I used to have about 10 tenants living in my yard but now I’m left with only two. The others left because of the unbearable situation,” Mpephela said. Lonwabo Kowa, communication manager of the Chris Hani Municipality, said the situation was being addressed. “Currently the area uses septic tanks, some of which were illegally installed. This resulted in uncontrollable overflows.” He said they were conducting assessments in the area and would send a honeysucker and jet machine by the end of the week to relieve the overflow. “Plans are in place to connect the whole area to a sewerage network. Connection points have been installed in each yard and construction of a pump station will regulate the sewerage network once completed.”
