Renowned personality, Somizi Mhlongo was lead host at the 24th annual South African Music Awards this past weekend in Sun City. The flamboyant personality was evidently missing from the red-carpet portion of the evening, presumably to get ready for that dramatic opening of the awards. Understandable. In his absence, his daughter Bahumi Mhlongo walked the red carpet hand-in-hand with Somizi’s fiancé, Mohale Motaung. A lot of people have found it odd that he would walk the carpet, which is reserved for media personalities and industry leaders, Mohale is neither. In fact, his only claim to fame is his fiancé. Fans have also taken to social media to question why Mohale would walk the red carpet when he has been adamant that he wants nothing to do with fame. One would understand if he were walking the carpet with his fiancé, Somizi as his date but that was not the case. Not to mention the fact that Somizi has vehemently defended his man whenever critics accused him of being in the relationship for all the wrong reasons. Somizi’s fans have repeatedly raised their eyebrows at Mohale, questioning his true motives for dating the famous SomGaga. He has been accused of using Somizi for fame and money but has strongly denied those rumours at every turn. He has even denied wanting to be famous and so fans are now wondering why he would even walk the red carpet at the SAMAs at all.
