“WE MINE – we don’t steal!” That was what the zama zamas from Northern Cape have always claimed. Now they’ll be able to mine legally after mineral resource deputy minister Godfrey Oliphant handed over two mining permits to artisanal miners in Kimberley. The People’s Paper published the story of protesting illegal miners in the Diamond City on 11 May last year. During the protest their Northern Cape chairman, Lucky Seekoei, said: “We’re just taking what belongs to black people. We opened cases of theft of mining equipment against known companies but the police are doing nothing.” But now it seems their worries could be a thing of the past. The artisanal miners successfully negotiated with Ekapa mining. Now they have access to 500 hectares of ground to mine for themselves. The signing event was held at Mayibuye Multipurpose Centre in Galeshewe yesterday. Elisa Louw, secretary of the Northern Cape Artisanal Miners, said she was over the moon. “No more fighting for us. We will now get to work and get diamonds without troubles.” Obakeng Monyera (37) from Kimberley said he had 12 years’ experience as a miner. “There was no work, so I joined illegal mining at that time. Today the deputy minister said we are free to sell and we will be recognised as legal miners. This is history in the making,” said Obakeng. Oliphant said: “The department will only legalise areas where it is safe to do so. This is the first successful zama zama project in the country and was made possible through a partnership with Ekapa mining, the Northern Cape premier’s office and a Swedish housing project.”
