The date for the very first Fill Up concert outside of Johannesburg has been announced and the Tsibipians are going insane. Abuti Fill Up himself, Cassper Nyovest finally made the announcement this morning and itâ€™s blowing up the internet. In a matter of four hours, the announcement video has received over 10 thousand interactions from fans. On the 1st of December 2018, Cassper Nyovest will attempt to fill up Moses Mabhida stadium in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. The stadium has a capacity of 85 000 people, which is less than the 94 000 seat capacity of FNB Stadium which Cassper tried to fill up on 2 December 2017. This will be the fourth Fill Up concert after Fill Up The Dome, Fill Up Orlando, and Fill Up FNB Stadium.
