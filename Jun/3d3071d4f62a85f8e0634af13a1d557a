 BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic chairman Max Tshabalala has confirmed that the club has come to an agreement with former Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela. Komphela has been a free agent since April, after resigning from his position at Chiefs, but it appears that he won’t be out of work for too long as he prepares for the next challenge in his career. On the other side Celtic have been on the lookout for a new mentor since Veselin Jelusic decided to hand in his resignation, and have moved swiftly to agree to terms with his successor. Tshabalala confirmed to Soccer Laduma the agreement as he said: “Yes, we have agreed with Steve Komphela, I don’t know how it got out, but we’ve agreed on terms. We decided to go for Steve Komphela because we believe that he’s the best man for the job.  “We need someone to uplift the morale in the team… He understands South African football and has been in the Free State in the past. The club is a big brand and for the supporters, we need to build the team.”
