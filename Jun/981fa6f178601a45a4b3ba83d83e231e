ZANDILE Maduna claimed that whenever she spoke to other men, her husband would fly into a jealous rage. She claimed she used to have a beautiful face but it was left scarred by her husband’s attacks with knives, screwdrivers and broken bottles. The woman from Kingsway near Lindelani in Benoni, Ekurhuleni, claimed her husband cut her face to make sure no other man would want to look at her and even threatened her with an axe once. Zandile, who was forced to run away from her home, would like to see her husband arrested. “He has ruined by life. Look at me now. I have lost my confidence,” she said. Zandile claimed her husband turned into a monster after he lost his job three years ago. She told the SunTeam he started accusing her of cheating, which he said had been confirmed by a sangoma. “I have never cheated on that man. He is just insecure and would sit up waiting for me to come home. If I came back a few minutes late, I would be beaten,” said Zandile. “I ran away from my house because I could see he would eventually kill me.” “I am so scared. The man is roaming around and cops are taking their time to arrest him.” Captain Nomsa Sekele said Zandile’s husband was hard to pin down. Anyone with information about his whereabouts is asked to contact Constable Joseph Moshogo on 060 470 1681 or to phone 08600 10111.
