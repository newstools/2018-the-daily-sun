GOING to the toilet has become a nightmare for the Tikoane family. They cannot go near their own toilet, since it is always overflowing with kak! The worried Tikoanes from Thethe kasi in Clocolan, Free State, told Daily Sun their toilet had been blocked for three months and they had reported the matter to the Setsoto Municipality many times, but nothing had been done about it. Basie Tikoane (46) told the SunTeam: “It seems I’m the one who suffers every time the manhole gets blocked. I really don’t know what’s happening. “I sometimes think I’m cursed. We’re told to report problems like this to our councillors, but I believe they’re useless.” Basie said he spent most of his time surrounded by kak. “I’m really worried about the health of my children. When I call the municipal offices, they recognise my voice and ask if the toilet hasn’t been unblocked yet.” Municipal spokeswoman Moroesi Gaba said the municipality was not aware of the matter as it was not registered on the customer care complaints register. “However,we will investigate and attend to the matter with immediate effect. “We would like to urge community members to formally report complaints to our customer care department and request reference numbers as proof,” she said.
