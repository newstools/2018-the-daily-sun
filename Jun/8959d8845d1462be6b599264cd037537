THEIR children drowned in a trench two months ago. To make matters worse, the mothers of Thabo Mosupye (9) and Kgaugelo Ngobese (8) see the hole every day. When the municipality failed to address the problem, residents of Lebotloane, North West, hired a machine to drain water out of the big hole. “All we wanted was for the municipality to do something about this issue,” said a resident. Lillian Ngobese (37), Kgaugelo’s mum, said she wants all the water in the trench to be removed. “It is being drained slowly and will eventually be empty. “I wish something could have been done immediately after my son was buried,” she said. Mmasebueng Mosupye (36) said it would take her a long time to get over Thabo’s death. “We told our councillor the municipality would only take us seriously after someone died,” she said. “Children died but we are still being ignored. “We are going to take turns guarding this place until it is safe.” Moretele municipal spokesman Mothupi Malebye said he was aware of the matter. He said municipal officials had visited the trench. Malebye said the area had received a development programme budget. He said: “The ward councillor should advise the community to make the trench a budget priority so the municipality can help them.”
