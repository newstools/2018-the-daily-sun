GAUTENG’s top cop, Provincial Commissioner Major-General Deliwe De Lange, is packing away her guns. This as the “Iron Lady” has been placed on early retirement and has started to remove her personal belongings from her state office. According to Daily Sun’s sources, De Lange was sent packing following alleged poor performance which saw crime stats in Gauteng skyrocket. Last year she was hauled over the coals by the Gauteng Legislature’s portfolio committee on community safety after a spike in murder cases. She was apparently given other options in the SAPS, but the head lady decided to take early retirement. It was also rumoured that former Gauteng police commissioner Mzwandile Petros will be taking over from 1 July. De Lange, who has been a cop for more than 30 years, took office in March 2016. She was promoted from the rank of major-general and the position of deputy commissioner for human resource management, the job she had held since February 2015. Six years prior to that, De Lange was the cluster commander for Sebokeng in southern Gauteng, housing eight police stations. Speaking to Daily Sun, a source said workers were feeling mixed emotions after the announcement. “Those who like power and were close to De Lange are saddened, while workers in junior positions are happy. Men and women on the ground were not considered,” said the source. Police spokeswoman Colonel Athlenda Mathe would not comment. She only said “relevant announcements will be made by management at an appropriate time”.
