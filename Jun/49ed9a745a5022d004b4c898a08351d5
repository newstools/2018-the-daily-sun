POPULAR Tshwane DJ and producer Sir Javas has died. Daily Sun has learnt the DJ, whose real name was Njabulo Nxumalo, died on Wednesday after losing a battle with meningitis – an infection of the brain and spinal cord. Known for his hit single Makoya, he was one of the most popular musicians in Tshwane. His aunt Mamcane Bongi confirmed his death. She said the family was coping. “So far, everything is going well and we are trying to be strong and to be there for his mum.” Bongi said the family had received a lot of support from Sir Javas’ colleagues in the music industry. “We are grateful for the support everyone has been showing us,” she said. After his Sama-winning group Rhythmic Elements split in 2012, Sir Javas joined Indigenous Tsie with Sipho Msiza, McKenzie Matome and Titus TK Kotu. He released two albums and a single called Charma Boy, which featured DJ Bucks and McKenzie last year.
