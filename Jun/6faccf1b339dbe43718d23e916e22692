Thando Thabethe is currently one of the leading talents in the local entertainment industry. She is at the top of her game, arguably at the peak of her career and at only 28, with the world at her feet, who is to say it can’t get any better? The multitalented star took to social media to leave a touching message to her late father, whom she described as being “very instrumental” in her life. “I wish you were here to see the woman I have grown into,” she captioned an old picture of her late father. “I miss your voice, your laughter, your love, drinking milk together before we went to bed, eating raw liver...and no doubt my love for music is as a result of your influence,” she added before wishing him a happy 56th birthday in heaven. The star also celebrated her own birthday recently at a star studded party at Taboo in Sandton. Check out the lovely message below: Daddy would have been 56 today ...I wish you were here to see the woman I have grown into.
