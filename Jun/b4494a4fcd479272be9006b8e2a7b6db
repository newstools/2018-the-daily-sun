TWO learners were killed when a school hostel was ravaged by
fire in Motetema outside Groblersdal. It is alleged that a community member noticed fire at the Makaepea
School for Muslims hostel. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the
community member then notified the police, who reacted quickly and started with
initial investigations. He said the police are investigating a case of two counts of
inquest following the death. “Preliminary police crime scene investigations have found
that the hostel caught fire and two learners aged 6 and 15 years were burnt to
death,” Ngoepe said. Ngoepe said the cause of fire which led to the death of
these two children is still unknown but, ongoing police investigations would
tell.
