WHEN a teacher found a matric schoolgirl standing next to a boy last week, he accused them of being up to no good. According to the 19-year-old Aphiwe Madikane from Rivoni Secondary School in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, the teacher took off a belt and moered her in front of classmates. Aphiwe said the painful experience didn’t stop there. She said the teacher moered her again when they got back to the school bus, this time with fists. Now her angry parents want the Gauteng Education Department to take action. The girl’s father, Josia Mbele, told the People’s Paper: “He beat my daughter with fists, as if he were fighting with a man. “This is unacceptable. He vented out his frustrations on my child. “We hear my daughter is not the first to be assaulted. “We were told he targets girls and fears challenging boys because he knows they will show him flames.” He said his daughter was too scared to go to school for two days following the incident. They went to report the teacher to the Ekurhuleni East district education offices, but claimed steps were taken against the teacher. “We even went to the school, but the principal was reluctant to listen to our story,” he said. Aphiwe said: “We’re not dating. The teacher just became aggressive and started assaulting me with his belt and fists.” Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said officials will be sent to the school to find out what happened.
