“NYAOPE has ruined my life. “If I were you, I wouldn’t even try it. Take it from me.” These were the words of a nyaope addict who is trying to recover. Thandokazi Bantidini (34) from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun she regretted the day she started using the drug. “I only had two pulls and from then I was hooked,” she said. She said since that day, she couldn’t stay away from it. “It destroyed my life. I was in a happy relationship with the father of my kid but then we broke up,” she said. She said she introduced the father of her child to nyaope and they would stay away from work and lounge at home to smoke. He ended up being fired,” she said. Thandokazi said her boyfriend’s family sent him to rehab. “He came back fine but I was still on it,” she said. She said that led to their break-up. “I came back home but my family couldn’t afford expensive rehab for me,” she said. Thandokazi said that was in 2016. “I wanted to quit but the minute I decided not to take nyaope, I suffered. My whole body itched and I got stomach cramps,” she cried. “Only nyaope can take away that feeling and that’s why I keep going back to smoking it,” said the mother of one. She said from the beginning of this year, she has been trying to get to rehab. “But I’ve been rejected,” she said. “That’s why I’ve turned to Daily Sun for help. I really need help. I want to quit smoking this nyaope,” she said.
