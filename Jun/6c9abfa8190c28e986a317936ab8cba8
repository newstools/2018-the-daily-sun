The South
African Institute of Charted Accountants (SAICA) has announced that they are
pursuing charges of misconduct against former Eskom CFO Anoj Singh. SAICA
released a statement detailing their reasons for charging Singh. Singh was
suspended by the power utility in September last year after allegations
surfaced that that he was involved in irregularly awarding contracts to
Gupta-linked businesses. According
to SAICA, Singh failed to disclose to the Eskom Board of Directors the true
reason for Tegeta's request of some R600 million from Eskom. “Mr Anoj
Singh was knowingly associated with reports, returns, communications or other
information where he knew or believed, or ought reasonably to have known, that
the information contained materially false or misleading statements,” the
statement read. SAICA has
given Singh 21 days to respond to the charges laid against him. “Once his
response to the charges is received, the SAICA secretariat will review the
response and table the matter for adjudication before the Professional Conduct
Committee. “Details of
the subsequent disciplinary hearing will be provided to all stakeholders once
such details have been confirmed with the relevant Professional Conduct
Committee chairperson and panel,” SAICA said. SAICA also
said that Singh conducted himself “in a manner which, in the opinion of the
Professional Conduct Committee or the Disciplinary Committee, is discreditable,
dishonourable, dishonest, irregular or unworthy, or which is derogatory to the
Institute, or tends to bring the profession of accountancy into disrepute.” Twitter:
