WITNESSES for the Moerane Commission will finally receive state protection. This is in response to key witness Thabiso Zulu storming into KZN Premier Willies Mchunu’s office on Tuesday. Zulu testified about the assassination of former ANC Youth League national secretary Sindiso Magaqa. Mchunu’s spokesman, Thami Ngidi, said the premier had started looking into the safety of the witnesses who testified at the commission. Ngidi said the premier had contacted Zulu to discuss his safety problems. He said the premier also informed Police Minister Bheki Cele about Zulu and the other witnesses. Ngidi said: “Premier Mchunu is attending to Zulu’s security concerns. Now that the commission has completed its work and handed over its final report, the safety of the witnesses is being considered.”
