VUYISILE Stillo believes medicine and healthy habits are the perfect tag team against illness. The 34-year-old from NU3 in Mdantsane near East London is the owner of Nondzondelelo In Service Centre for the Aged, an exercise club for the elderly. He opened the club in 2012 after he realised the gogos and madalas in his kasi were always going to the local clinic. “I was shocked when I saw that most elderly people who were on treatment get worse instead of better,” he said. Vuyisile said he invited the elderly people in his kasi to the club. “They were reluctant, but I managed to convince them. “The club has 24 members. We meet on Wednesdays and Fridays from 10am to 12pm. “They play games such as ring the stick and duck walk. “This is my way of giving back to the community.” Selinah Mgida (58) said she joined the club in 2014 because she had been suffering from high blood pressure. “Since I joined the club I no longer take treatment. I am healthy,” she said. Duncan Mkhunqwana (78) said the club gives him peace of mind. “When I am here I relax and forget about my problems. “I love running and stretching. I can lift anything,” he said. Elfrida Mdoda (60) said: “Since I joined the club my body feels renewed and I no longer suffer from cramps. “Our biggest wish is to exercise on a proper sports ground. “We would also appreciate it if a good Samaritan gave us kits.”
