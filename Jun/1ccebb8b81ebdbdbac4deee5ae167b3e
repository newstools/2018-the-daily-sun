HOW many South Africans does it take to fix a blocked drain? Apparently a whole army division! This is the conclusion among residents of Tlhabologang near Coligny, North West. Members of the SA National Defence Force were roped in to unblock their sewer system. Residents were pleasantly surprised to see the military men in trucks coming and going to their kasi since Monday. The soldiers came to drain and unblock the sewer system that the local and provincial government has failed to do for many months. The army was sent in by the national government, acting to restore services in the collapsing and troubled province. Last month, Minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi announced that soldiers had been sent to Mahikeng Hospital to help doctors and nurses with health services. Health problems were the main cause of protests in April which resulted in Supra Mahumapelo’s resignation. Ditsobotla Municipality posted pictures on Facebook of the army cleaning up and warned residents not to panic, as the army was in the area only to suck sewage from blocked manholes. “Residents are hereby requested not to panic but to show co-operation to the SANDF intervention team in our municipality.” The province is still waiting to hear who’ll be the next premier after Mahumapelo finally stepped down last month.
