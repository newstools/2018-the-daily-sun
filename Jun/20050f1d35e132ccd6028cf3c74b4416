THE mum of a girl who was allegedly raped two years ago says while her family is still traumatised, the rapist is walking free. The mum from Alexandra, Joburg, said after her daughter was raped, allegedly by a soccer player’s son, she tried to take her life. The mum said the rape took place at the soccer star’s house in Gallo Manor, Joburg, in February 2016, when her daughter was only 14. The girl was apparently attending a party at the house when the crime happened. The teenager said she passed out from drinking too much and the suspect allegedly had sex with her. The mum said her daughter only told her about the incident this year. “I then remembered how she tried to kill herself in 2016,” said the mum. “She overdosed on pills and had to go to hospital.” She said in February her daughter’s friend sent her a voice note telling her what had happened. “I immediately broke down and cried,” she said. The suspect appeared in the Alexandra Magistrates Court yesterday. The case was postponed to 4 July. However, the mum was not happy as the suspect was released on bail. “This thing is taking its toll on me,” she said. “I cry myself to sleep every night because I want the nightmare to end.” Deborah Francisco of the ANC Women’s League in Alexandra told Daily Sun: “Our children can’t continue to be raped and killed like this while nothing is done.”
