A GIRL’S life has been shattered after being preyed on by
a 73-year-old sangoma, who has confessed to raping the child on multiple occasions. Worse still, the girl is now pregnant. According to Punch,
Joseph Umuluku was finally bust doing his evil deed earlier this week when
neighbours caught him raping the girl in the bathroom of her house in the
southern Nigerian city of Warri. A medical test then revealed she was pregnant. Her mum reported the crime to the cops, who then arrested
the sangoma. Umuluku lived in the same neighbourhood as the girl and
her family. He claims to have hypnotised the girl before he raped
her. The Delta State cop spokesman, Andrew Aniamaka said: “The
old man also impregnated the 13-year-old teenager. He has confessed to the
crime.” He has been charged with defilement, which is the
Nigerian legal term for rape.
