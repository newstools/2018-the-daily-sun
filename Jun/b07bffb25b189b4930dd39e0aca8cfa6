The Constitutional Court has ruled that political parties should disclose the private funders to the public. Chief Justice
Mogoeng Mogoeng said on Thursday morning that "It is declared that information
on private funding of political parties and independent candidates is essential
for the effective exercise of the right to make political choices and to
participate in the elections." He said the disclosure of private donors to political
parties must be recorded and made easily accessible. The Constitutional Court has confirmed a ruling by the
Western Cape High Court which found that the Promotion of Access to Information
Act (PAIA) was unconstitutional because it did not provide for the disclosure
of information pertaining to the private funding that political parties receive. Mogoeng ruled that Parliament must amend PAIA and
"take any other measures it deems appropriate" to provide for this
within a period on 18 months. Non-profit organisation My Vote Counts had previously
argued in the Constitutional Court that it was critical for voters to know who
funded political parties, so that citizens could be informed and make the right
decisions. High Court Judge Yasmin Shenaz Meer ruled last year that
Parliament had 18 months to rectify the "inconsistencies" in the
PAIA.
