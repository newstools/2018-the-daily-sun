THEY had it all planned! They removed four battery network towers carefully from the main tower. The batteries were dragged to the car but just as they were about to load them, thugs found themselves surrounded with no way out. Two suspects were arrested by the owner of Chamdor Training Centre in Kagiso, Mogale City and his guards on Saturday night. The suspects had cut the electric fence to gain entry to the centre. Captain Solomon Sibiya said they are worried about the growing trend of stripping towers of their batteries. He said the owner received a call about the business robbery on Saturday night. “On arrival, he and his guards found one suspect carrying a huge black battery stolen from the MTN tower installed inside the training centre to his car.” There were two more suspects. One of the suspects managed to flee from the scene but two of his accomplices were caught. They were handed over to cops and taken to Kagiso Police Station, where a case of theft and business burglary was opened. Sibiya said the suspects will appear in court soon. They are still looking for the third suspect. Anyone with information is asked to contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
