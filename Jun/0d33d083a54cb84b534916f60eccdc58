The Mseleni family from phase two in Philippi, Cape Town, is mourning the loss of two family members. The mother and son were gunned down by unknown hitmen at their home on Friday afternoon. It is believed the incident is related to ongoing taxi violence in the province. Family member Buyisile Dansta (56) told Daily Sun his nephew Mawonga Mseleni (33) was standing outside chatting with his father Mzuvukile Vusani (58), a taxi owner. “A car came down the road and the occupants started shooting at them,” he said. “They shot and killed Mawonga. “His mother, Nomonde Mselani (54), was caught in the crossfire. “She also died on the spot, but my brother miraculously survived.” Buyisile said Mzuvukile owns a taxi but he is not affiliated with any of the local taxi associations. “This does not add up because he is only into school and long-distance contracts. We have no idea why he was targeted,” he said. “We want justice to take its course and the perpetrators should pay.” Buyisile said Nomonde rushed outside when she heard gunshots. “My brother escaped unharmed, but his wife and son were not so lucky.” Buyisile said the family had been preparing to travel to Eastern Cape that night to attend the funeral of a family member who was among the nine taxi drivers who were shot dead in Cape Town two weeks ago. “People do evil things. It is very difficult to accept this. We are confused and hurt. We want answers.” Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association spokesman Andile Seyamo distanced his association from the incident. Bethusile Ndungane, of the Congress of Democratic Taxi Associations, vowed that his organisation had nothing to do with the event. Western Cape police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: “A male (33) and woman (54) were shot and killed by unknown suspects in Machibini Road on Friday. The motive behind this incident is still unknown. “No one has been arrested and police are still investigating,” said Traut.
