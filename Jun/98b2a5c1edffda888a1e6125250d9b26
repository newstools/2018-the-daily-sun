ALL seemed well when siblings Joshua (33) and Shumani Simango (35) received their ID books in 2003. In 2011, Shumani went back into the Dzanani Home Affairs branch in Venda, Limpopo, in 2011 to register her child’s birth. But when she got there, Home Affairs officials said their system indicated that Joshua’s photo was in her ID. Joshua, from Tshavhalovhedzi Village in Nzhelele said he and Shumani were advised to apply for new ID books in 2012. However, he said he and his sister have not received them. “In 2016 we were advised to reapply but the IDs never came,” he said. “I don’t understand why it is taking so long. “I’m frustrated because nothing good has come from my constant visits to Home Affairs.” Joshua said he is yet to receive the Smart Card ID he applied for last year. “Now I don’t know what to do anymore because my life is on hold. “My future is ruined. “I often come across good job opportunities but without an ID it is impossible to apply for employment. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the national office contacted the Limpopo branch to find out more about Joshua’s case. Mokgola said Home Affairs will look into Joshua’s complaint. He said: “An official has been delegated to contact the complainant for further information. “The matter is receiving urgent attention.”
