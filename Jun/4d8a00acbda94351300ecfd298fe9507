MADALA Absalom Ntsele said he’s tired of living a dull and lonely life. Although he’s 81 and blind, the lonely man from Mbonambi, outside Richards Bay on the KZN North Coast, told Daily Sun he needed a lover to share his bed. He said his three-roomed RDP was too big for him and it was very cold without a woman. “This loneliness is stressing me. I’ve been living alone since the mum of my six children took the kids and went to live in Ngwelezane,” he said. “I wasn’t married to her so it wasn’t difficult for her to leave me. However, my kids do visit me once a year.” The madala said he wasn’t blind when his partner left him. But now he needs a woman who didn’t mind his disability. “I don’t care if the woman is employed or not. We will survive on my pension grant as long as she makes me happy and make me feel like a man,” he said. Madala Absalom told the SunTeam he needed a lively person who would make bedtime memorable. “My 4-5 has been lonely since 1997 and it needs to go out and play now. That doesn’t mean we will need to bonk every night. Sometimes we will cuddle and have pillow talk before we sleep.” Madala said although he was blind, he could cook, clean and wash his own clothes. He said he had tried to find a lover in the past with no luck because all the women he went after were not what he was looking for.
