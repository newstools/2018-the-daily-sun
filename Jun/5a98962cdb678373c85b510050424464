ECONOMIC Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema appeared in the Newcastle Magistrate's court on Monday morning. The case is expected to be back in court in February 2019. Malema appeared in court for calling on EFF supporters to invade unoccupied land in 2016. According to the charge sheet, Malema has been accused of incitement to commit a crime. In 2016, Malema reportedly unlawfully and intentionally incited, instigated his Economic Freedom Fighters and or others to commit a crime, in contravention of Section 1 (1) of the Trespass Act 6 of 1959 by illegally occupying any vacant land wherever they found some and thereby committing the crime of incitement. In a previous court appearance in July 2017, Malema said he was merely repeating what the Freedom Charter said. Following that Malema again told KwaZulu-Natal supporters in Newcastle to grab land, he said it belonged to the people.
