FORMER Mpumalanga Black Aces captain Esau Mtsweni has praised Tim Sukazi for bringing a National First Division (NFD) team to KwaNdebele, Mpumalanga. Sukazi, a well-known player agent, has bought NFD side Cape Town All Stars and renamed it TS Galaxy. The club will move from Cape Town where it was based to Sukazi’s home town of KwaNdebele next season. This will be the first time the people of KwaNdebele have a professional team in their backyard. And the 37-year-old Mtsweni, who has also played for Bidvest Wits and University of Pretoria FC, is happy that the community won’t have to travel long distances to watch quality football – or support other teams any more. “Everyone I know is happy about this too and we can’t wait for the season to start,” said Mtsweni. “I am proud of Tim and thankful for what he has done for our community. “When we talk about giving back to the community – this is it.” He added: “People in KwaNdebele had to travel to Emalahleni or Tshwane to watch football games. But now we have our own team to support and will have a game to watch almost every weekend. There is a chance of seeing the likes of Kaizer Chiefs, Mamelodi Sundowns or Orlando Pirates coming here in the Nedbank Cup.” Mtsweni, who retired from football in 2015 while playing for Aces, also mentioned that having an NFD team would help football development in the area. “There aren’t many professional footballers who hail from this area,” he said. “But now, because we have a team, I predict that lots of youngsters from here will play in the NFD and PSL soon – and that will be because of Tim and his club.” The only notable players from the area who have had a stint in the top flight are Mtsweni and July Mahlangu. Mtsweni is currently enjoying his retirement but says he is ready to help if Sukazi needs his services.
