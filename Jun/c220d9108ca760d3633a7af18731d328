Nonjabulo Ntombela (17) went missing last month and now her terrified gogo fears the worst. “All I pray for is to at least find her bones so we can bury her and have peace in our hearts, knowing where she is,” said GOGO Buselaphi Ngcobo. The gogo (101) said she’s been having sleepless nights since her disappearance on 11 May. The grade 10 pupil of Ematshematshe Village in Pomeroy, northern KZN, left home that morning to go to school but she never returned. Gogo said her cellphone was off and she was worried because she never left home without saying where she was going. “She was a happy child. We never fought and I loved her very much.” Gogo Buselaphi said when Nonjabulo didn’t return home she thought she had gone to the library because she had told her she had assignments to do and needed to use the internet. “I went to bed hoping I would see her in the morning but I didn’t. I asked my other grandchildren about her but they told me she hadn’t returned home. I alerted my neighbours who then helped us search for her.” She said she even checked with her relatives in Empangeni, Mtubatuba and Nquthu but she wasn’t with them. “I asked her friends and they told me they last saw her at school. I then turned to cops for help,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed a missing person’s case was reported to Dundee cops for investigation. “We appeal to anyone with information on her whereabouts to contact Dundee police at 034 299 8221 or CrimeStop at 08600 10111,” said Mbele.
