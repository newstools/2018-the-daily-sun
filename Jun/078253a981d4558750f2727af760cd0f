GENERAL Khehla Sitole and his blue charges embarked on an anti-cop killing awareness campaign yesterday. The campaign made Soshanguve, Tshwane its first port of call in response to the increased number of cop murders and attacks. The national police commissioner said: “Our members die for the communities they have vowed to protect and serve until the end.” He said from 1 April last year to 31 March, 85 cops have died on and off duty throughout the country. They’ve been killed while responding to complaints, making arrests, at stop-and-search operations, or by suspects resisting arrest. “Our members are murdered for their firearms, which criminals use to commit serious, violent crimes. “Sometimes this happens even while they are off duty, in full view of their loved ones.” He said most murdered cops were young and in the prime of their careers. “The sad reality is that they leave behind kids with an uncertain future.” Sitole said police safety initiatives and plans couldn’t succeed without the co-operation of communities. “Today we’re appealing to everyone on all levels of society, young and old, to stand together with the police to stop the ruthless criminals who threaten the stability and peace in our country.” The cops visited Khaya Orphanage Centre, where they donated blankets, food parcels and money. “I personally declare these kids ambassadors of youth crime prevention. This home should be adopted as our project from this day.” Lydia Rasimpi, the centre’s founder, was overwhelmed by the donations.
