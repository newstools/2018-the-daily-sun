THE Port Elizabeth Regional Court this week sentenced a gangster to 37 years in prison for murder and attempted murder. Reneal Seagal (21) of the Hondekoppe gang committed the crimes in 2015. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said: “On 20 August 2015, two couples were walking on Aandblom Street in Arcadia when two men called the women. “The men asked the women if their partners were the people they were looking for. The men then saw a person they were looking for knocking on the door of a house. “One of the men fired several shots, killing the person who was knocking on the door. The couples were also shot at while fleeing. A 25-year-old man sustained an injury to his shoulder.” Naidu said three months after the incident, one of the witnesses was killed in a gang-related shooting. “A week after the murder, cops arrested two suspects at a house in Arcadia. One suspect was released due to lack of evidence against him. But Seagal was kept in jail.” Mount Road cluster commander Major-General Thembisile Patekile praised the police for making the arrest and ensuring that the suspect was convicted. “Our cops work tirelessly around the clock to arrest suspects who commit senseless attacks on the community. We will continue to make our presence felt in these hot spot areas. We will fulfil our obligations to the people who depend on us for their safety and security.”
