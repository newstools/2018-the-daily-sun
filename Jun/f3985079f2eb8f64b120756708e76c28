A GRIEVING mum is blaming herself for the death of her daughter and granddaughter. Nompumelelo (23) and Sbahle Chili (2) died after a roof collapsed on them while they were sleeping in their home in Savannah Park, Durban on Friday. Gcinokuhle Chili (23), Nompumelelo’s sister, is still trying to come to terms with the death of her two-year-old child. Her other children, aged three and eight, sustained minor injuries. “My mother, who works as a domestic worker, has been struggling to raise money to buy a roof. “Last month she told us she had enough money so we called a builder to erect the roof,” said Gcinokuhle. But according to Gcinokuhle, the builder disappeared before he finished the job. Gcinokuhle said they got another builder but he said he had to start from scratch. “He advised us to sleep in other rooms while he worked on the roof.” Gcinokuhle said on Thursday she noticed the poles used to hold up the roof were bending. “Nompumelelo took the three children and slept in the rooms with the collapsing roof. She said the other rooms were cold. “The roof caved in the next morning.” She said her mother blames herself for the incident. “She said if she hadn’t tried to put up the roof her daughter and granddaughter would still be alive. “But she will still try to have the roof erected.” Nompumelelo’s mum said she was too traumatised to give the SunTeam a comment. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said an inquest docket was opened.
