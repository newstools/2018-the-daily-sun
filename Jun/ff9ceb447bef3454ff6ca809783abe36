THATO Makapa (39) was well known for wearing expensive clothing and attending lavish parties. When his bruised, naked corpse was found in a bush, his family suspected envy was to blame for his death. His relatives said he had been wearing an expensive outfit worth about R8 000 when he was killed. Thato was last seen on 27 May with his brother, Goodman, at their home in Phiri, Soweto. Goodman said Thato told him he was going to sleep inside the house and left him in the back room. The next time he saw his brother, three days later, was in a mortuary. A passer-by had alerted the cops to a dead body in bush near Snake Park. Goodman said after Thato disappeared he found out that his friends had taken him to a club in Mofolo. Goodman said: “His friends told us Thato got into a fight with three men at the club. The men shoved Thato into their car boot and drove away. His friends tried to chase his abductors, but they lost them along the way. “My brother and I have always loved expensive clothes. “There are people who despise me because of my style. This might have been the case with my brother. “Thato was not a violent person. He did not deserve to be killed in that manner. “I think his attackers were jealous of his lifestyle.” Thato worked as a stadium vendor. Police spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza said: “Police are investigating a case of kidnapping. Three suspects have been arrested.” The family are, however, not pleased with the investigation’s progress. They said a case of murder should be investigated as well. They claim the cop who is handling the case has tampered with the investigation. Thato’s cousin, Tebogo Mazimbela, said: “The suspects are out on bail. The investigating officer avoids us whenever we want an update.” Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokesman Moses Dlamini advised the family to lay a formal complaint through the provincial police commissioner’s office.
