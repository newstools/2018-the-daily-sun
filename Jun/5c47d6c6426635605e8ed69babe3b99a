LISTENING to her ancestors has solved all her problems. Pretty Lubisi (38) from Orinocco near Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga, said her jealous ancestors wouldn’t let her be with her husband. And they nearly destroyed her life because they wanted her to be a healer. Pretty told Daily Sun that fighting the ancestors cost her her previous marriages and many jobs. Her ancestors had warned her not to have sex with her current husband Mandla Mhlongo (50) before ukuthwasa. But on Sunday, the ukuthwasa was performed and Pretty, her family and ancestors are happy. “I will be working with my family and in-laws, who’re also traditional healers,” she said. Mum Selinah Lubisi (69) and aunt Anna Mathebula (72), both sangomas, also attended the ceremony. It was supervised by her popular traditional healer in-laws in Calcutta, in Mkhuhlu outside Hazyveiw. Mandla, who’s also a healer, told the SunTeam he was happy to finally be with his wife. “We met four years ago, but her ancestors kept troubling her,” said Mandla. “They would come out, threatening to destroy our marriage if she didn’t go to thwasa. “So I decided to train her myself under the supervision of my gobela mum Josephine. I’m happy her ancestors are finally at peace.” Josephine (86) said it was not easy training and mentoring her makoti, but she was happy everything is finally over. “She now is welcome to work with us in this healing family, and we hope the ancestors are happy,” said the gobela.
