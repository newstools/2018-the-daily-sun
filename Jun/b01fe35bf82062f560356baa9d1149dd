All roads lead to North West for the annual Samas. The awards ceremony takes place tonight, and the main one tomorrow at the Sun City Superbowl in Rustenburg. The main ceremony will include performances by Shekhinah, Distruction Boyz, DJ Tira, Bongeziwe Mabandla, the Soweto Gospel Choir and Die Heuwels Fantasties. DJ Tira said: “People can expect a great performance as usual. When I’m in the building, the event is bound to be a good one. It’s always good to have relevant acts featured on the Sama stage. “Artists have to remain consistent throughout the year. Afrotainment has done that, which is why the brand is still alive.” He said his record label is in the running for the most coveted award at the ceremony. “Distruction Boyz are gunning for the Song of the Year award for Omunye. “This is the year of gqom music and we urge people to vote for us so that we can take the award home.” The DJ said the Samas have a lot of surprises in store for music lovers. The ceremony will be hosted by Idols SA judge Somizi Mhlongo, radio presenter Dineo Ranaka and comedian Mpho Popps.
