NEIGHBOURS often picked up a strong aroma coming from her kitchen that didn’t quite smell like food. When cops pounced, they found the woman, a three-year-old toddler on her hip, working away in her drug lab – quietly and without a care in the world . . . Residents of Sherwood Gardens first got wind of evil things going on when they noticed the woman’s kitchen lights hardly went off at night. When the smell of boiling drugs got too strong to handle, they alerted cops. The woman (28) was using the kitchen in the suburb in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, as a drug lab. Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago, Ekurhuleni Metro cops spokesman, said: “Cops had to move in with speed on receiving the information to avert the drugs and the chemicals from being moved.” The drugs had a R1 million street value! “Huge quantities of raw materials for producing Khat were found,” he said. “Another huge quantity, in its final stages of production and contained in pans and several buckets, was confiscated.” The woman claimed the drugs belonged to her husband, but after several calls to him went unanswered, she was bust and taken to Brakpan cop shop. Her kid was left in the care of a relative. “She’s being detained at Brakpan Police Station on charges of possession of illicit substances and on suspicion of manufacturing and distributing narcotics.” She’s expected to appear in the Brakpan Magistrates Court soon.
