A FEW days ago, deputy president David Mabuza announced a new school would be built and named after photographer Sam Nzima. The school will be in Lilydale, Mpumalanga, where Nzima was from. But residents of nearby Kwaggafontein are not overjoyed with the news. They told Daily SunHlomani High School, which was built by residents many years ago, was in a terrible state and they were desperate for the government to fix it. Pupils said the classrooms didn’t even have windows and in winter, it was so cold many of them couldn’t face going to class and bunked. Community member Connie Khoza (51) said the school toilets were in a bad condition and the classroom walls were starting to crack. “Our children are forced to relieve themselves outside. We’re not saying they must not go to school but we call on the education department to intervene as soon as possible,” she said. Khoza said the government should not wait to act until a child has been killed by a collapsing wall. “We have gone through all the necessary processes and all we want is for the school to be fixed.” Gerald Sambo, spokesman for the Mpumalanga Department of Education, told Daily Sun a budget of R4 million had been set aside for the toilets to be fixed. He said former education MEC Reginah Mhaule visited the school on 6 February to assess the situation. “She made an undertaking that the department would build 30 toilets and would also use Mandela Day to repair the school’s infrastructure,” he said.
