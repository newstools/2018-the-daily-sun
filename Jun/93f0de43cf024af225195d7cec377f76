LAND invaders occupied an open space in Philippi, Cape Town last week. When they started there were fewer than 50 shacks and the city destroyed them. But now there is very little space unoccupied. The land grabbers named the place Ramaphosa squatter camp. Many shacks were destroyed by the wind and heavy rain that hit the province over the weekend. On Monday the residents were rebuilding their shacks. Nomzamo Thuthani (37) said: “We decided to name this place after President Cyril Ramaphosa because we invaded this piece of land after his appointment.” She said now that there were heavy rains they would need help from the City of Cape Town. “We know that at first the municipality warned us not to invade the land, but with the number of shacks that have been built here no one can chase us away now. This weather tried to ruin everything, but we won’t move. “Some of our shacks were blown away by the wind, but we are not going anywhere,” Nomzamo said. Another resident said they were sick and tired of renting. “Most of us here are not working and we do not have money to pay rent any more,” said the resident. MMC for informal settlements, water and waste services and energy councillor Xanthea Limberg said the residents occupying the land had been informed that the land was privately owned. She said the owner of the property had been alerted.
