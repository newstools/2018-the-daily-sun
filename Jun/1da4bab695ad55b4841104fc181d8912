The Queen of Kwaito has made a hot return and this time she is gracing us with a possible hit song titled "Ayina Chorus". Nomasonto Maswanganyi popularly known as Mshoza rose straight to fame at a tender age and has been in the industry for 18 years. The star has managed to stay relevant amongst the many things that have taken place in her personal life but what remains true is the fact that this kwaito star is very talented. Yesterday Bonang Matheba went on to Twitter to ask her followers if they have heard Mshoza's new song. The song seems to also has made quite an impact on Pearl Modiadie. The song was apparently released in April but with a lot that has been happening in the Kwaito's star's life the song was overshadowed. Listen to song previewÂ here.
