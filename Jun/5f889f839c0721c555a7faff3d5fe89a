THE Tyhalani family is still reeling from the shock of losing five kids in a shack fire. The children’s aunt, Nosibongile Dube (51), told Daily Sun: “We believe God was here when this happened and we also believe that He will give us the strength to carry on.” Mzuvikile Tyhalani (13), twins Lithemba and Lunje (18 months), Siyahluma (14) and Lunathi Filtane (12) died in a shack fire at Mesiya squatter camp in Kosovo, Philippi on Saturday morning. “We are still trying to come to terms with the tragedy,” she said. Nosibongile said the fire started behind the fridge. “My sister tried to save the kids. She took the twins to another room but the fire was too strong.” Nosibongile’s sister, Victoria Tyhalani (42), was saved by residents. They used a window to help her escape. “After she was rescued, she wanted to jump in front of a train. “She kept asking how she could live with herself knowing that she failed to save the kids’ lives. “We told her it was not her fault,” said Nosibongile. Lunathi was visiting the family and had only arrived on Friday. “The next day he was dead,” said Nosibongile. “We want to urge everyone who can help us to come forward.” Western Cape Human Settlement MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela visited the family on Sunday but no one was home. He later sent officials to ask the family what he could do to help. Spokeswoman Ntomboxolo Makoba-Somdaka said they will report back to the MEC, who will decide what assistance he can provide. “The family told officials they can’t afford to bury the children because they don’t have any funeral cover,” she said.
