TWO blind madalas are lucky to be alive but they are now homeless. Last Thursday, Sydney Martins (76) and Allens Jacobs (81) were sleeping in their RDP house at Tshing in Ventersdorp, North West, when a fire broke out. Allens is totally blind and Sydney is partially sighted. “I could smell the smoke and suspected something was burning in the house,” said Sydney. “It was difficult to breathe so I went to Allens’ room to pull him out of the house. “The flames were running through the house from the meter box.” He said neighbours came running and helped put out the fire. Now the two are left with only the clothes on their backs. They depend on neighbours for a place to sleep and for food. Community leader Naledi Rampa showed Daily Sun a court order that nullified the contract between the municipality and the contractor which installed the meter boxes. Rampa said the municipality appointed the contractor which also had a nullified contract in Modimolle, Limpopo. “The meter boxes are faulty and some were even bridged by officials who couldn’t fix them. There are businesses who are using electricity without paying because the officials failed to fix the faults but redirected the electricity to the main supply,” said Rampa. A neighbour said her electricity box was not working at all. Other neighbours confirmed the municipality was aware of the faulty meter boxes. Sydney and Allens said they want the municipality to fix their house and replace their furniture. The two madalas, who were left with only the clothes they were wearing, claim no one from the municipality had come to see them. William Maphosa, spokesman for the JB Marks Municipality, said: “The fire was caused by a heater that was left unattended.”
