LESIBA Tloubatla of the water affairs department has pleaded with Limpopo residents to use less water. This comes after the water levels in the province’s dams dropped recently. Tloubatla said according to the Weather Service, there would not be much rain in the province during the coming months. The average dam level in the province was at 75,5% this week, compared to 77,4% at this time last year. Tloubatla said as climate change was affecting rainfall in the province, people needed to start saving water. “The South African Weather Service Forecast shows we will not have enough rain to fill up our dams until at least the summer season,” he said. He said the province would need to continue implementing water restrictions. He also called on farmers to play their role in saving water as they would be very badly affected if the dams ran dry. Tzaneen Dam, which supplies farmers in the Mopani district, was only 40,6% full this week.
