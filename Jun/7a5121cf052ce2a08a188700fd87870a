THE battle for the Sekgopo throne at Ga-Sekgopo Village, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo, has turned into a war! Premier Stan Mathabatha announced recently that William Matsorwane’s claim to the throne was rejected. Queen Josephine Sekgopo will remain in the position. But this has sent villagers into a rage. They want Sekgopo to be replaced by Matsorwane. When cops prevented them from blocking the R8 road, they burnt down the house of one of Queen Josephine’s council members. Madala Sephomolo Mogale (71) said he wasn’t home on Tuesday night, but that his wife Maselaelo (62) and five grandkids were inside. “The villagers threw stones and smashed my windows,” he said. “They burnt my house by setting the curtains on fire. They also burned my mud house. “My family managed to flee and no one was injured. I don’t know why they burnt my house. “I only accompany Queen Josephine. I’m no decision maker.” He said the damage is more than R50 000. “I’m not afraid and I’m not going anywhere. I swear if I was around, I would’ve hurt someone,” he said. Sekgopo Traditional Council offices and schools are now closed. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said: “A case of arson was opened. No arrests have been made yet.” He urged anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects to call Colonel Cecil Machimane on 082 451 7181.
