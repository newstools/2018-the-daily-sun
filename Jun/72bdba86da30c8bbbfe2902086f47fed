THANDEKA Mtshali (28) said her life is a mess without an ID. The mum of one from Villieria in Tshwane said this was affecting her child as she couldn’t apply for her birth certificate. She told the People’s Paper her parents died many years ago. “They didn’t get me a birth certificate. After they died I lived with different families and no one helped me to get my ID,” she said. She said she couldn’t finish school. “Now I have a child who also doesn’t have a birth certificate. I can’t get a grant or a job,” said Thandeka. She’s been to the Home Affairs offices in town, but they were not helpful. “They told me I needed to get someone older than me from my family,” she said. “But all the elders in my family have died.” Spokesman Thabo Mokgola said: “She’ll have to undergo a rigorous process to ascertain she is who she claims to be. “Late registration of birth has in the past been used to gain citizenship fraudulently. The department needs to satisfy itself through this process.”
