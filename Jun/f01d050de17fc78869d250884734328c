MAIDI Chauke (45) couldn’t believe her eyes when she found her injured son in the dark in a hospital ward. Maidi’s 22-year-old son was admitted to Helen Franz Hospital in Senwabarwana, Limpopo, at about 2pm on Sunday. Her son was in a car accident and both his legs were broken. “But the doctor only checked his injuries at 8pm,” said Maidi. She said they had to use their cellphones to light the ward. “I spoke to a nurse after realising my son had been dumped in a dark ward. She told me the lights haven’t been working for a while. “The nurse said most patients and staff members in the ward are used to the situation. “She said the problem has been reported to the health department but the hospital is still waiting for a response.” Limpopo Health spokesman Neil Shikwambana said: “A cubicle in the male ward had burnt light bulbs. “The transformer that supplies power to the hospital is faulty. “When the power comes back after load shedding, the transformer burns lights and other electrical appliances. “We are changing the faulty transformer.”
