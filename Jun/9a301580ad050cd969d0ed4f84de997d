THREE teachers were hijacked at gunpoint as they arrived at their school on Monday morning. The incident happened at ACJ Phakade Primary School in Nomzamo, near Strand in Cape Town. CCTV footage shows five armed men tailgating them as they enter the school’s gate. One of the traumatised teachers told Daily Sun: “They directed us to park on the side and they pointed a gun at me.” Two of the three cars were recovered by traffic cops in Macassar. The third one was found abandoned on a pavement in Nomzamo, a few metres away from the school. “The men pointed guns at teachers and I screamed. I’ve never seen a real gun before. I’ve only seen those things on TV,” said a grade 3 pupil. The hijacking happened two days after the school marched to the local cop shop. They had demanded that police patrol the area before teachers arrive and leave in the afternoon. Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schafer said: “I condemn this attack on our teachers in the strongest possible terms. “It’s absolutely shocking that criminals are targeting innocent teachers. Thankfully, no one was hurt. Counselling is being provided for the teachers and witnesses.” The MEC said her department’s safe schools directorate has sent security to the school. This is the fifth armed robbery at a Western Cape school in the past month. Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “Cases of carjacking were registered for investigation after three cars – a Toyota Fortuner, an Etios and a Hyundai – were taken by force from their owners at a primary school in Nomzamo. Van Wyk said no arrests have been made yet.
