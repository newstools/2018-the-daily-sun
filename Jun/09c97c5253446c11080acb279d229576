The Moscow fan zone was a place of celebration for Argentina fans on Tuesday after they watched Jorge Sampaoli's team beat Nigeria 2-1 to advance to knockout stages of the World Cup. Marcus Rojo's stunning finish four minutes from time kept Lionel Messi and Argentina's World Cup hopes alive and set up a last 16 meeting with France. "It is marvellous to have won it in this manner. It is a deserved joy," Messi said in quotes on Argentina's official Twitter account. "We knew God was with us and wasn't going to let us go out. "I thank all the fans that are here, for all their sacrifice and to all those in Argentina that were always with us." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
