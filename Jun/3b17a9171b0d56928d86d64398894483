WHEN the Nkabindes’ daughter disappeared without a trace last Sunday they feared the worst and rushed to the police station to report her missing. But when cops investigated, the case docket was quickly changed. The cops are now hunting a theft suspect on the run! Nozipho Nkabinde (26) from KwaThema, Ekurhuleni is wanted in connection with a case of theft after allegedly stealing R380 000 from her employer. Nozipho was working as a bulk teller at Nedbank in Springs Mall. The police say they saw footage that was released by the bank. They allege the footage clearly shows Nozipho taking the money and leaving the bank. A source told Daily Sun that she was acting strangely on the last day she was seen. “She was last seen leaving her house on Sunday. Her boyfriend, Gilbert, picked her up. Her WhatsApp profile shows that she was last seen at about 4.30pm on Sunday,” said the source. The police said they would like to talk to Nozipho in connection with the theft case opened against her. “The police are also looking for her boyfriend for questioning,” said Springs police spokesman Captain Thabo Sibuyi. He confirmed that Nozipho had worked as a teller and was wanted for theft. “According to reports the suspect drove home to drop off her car and bank keys.
