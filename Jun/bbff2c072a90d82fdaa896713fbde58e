Sinovuyo Dimanda is a budding Afropop singer. Her music has placed her on track to become one of the most best musicians in Mzansi. She sings in Xhosa and tackles social issues such as teenage pregnancy and the stigma around people living with HIV and Aids. She told Daily Sun: “I like singing in my mother tongue. “I want to show young people Xhosa is cool. “That’s the reason they call me Intombi yakwa-Ntu. “I sing about life and the things that happen in our communities.” The 24-year-old started writing songs while she was studying at Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha. She released her first album, Ingqumbo yakwaNtu in 2016. She said she was inspired to pursue a music career by her late sister Thumeka, who was a gospel singer. Her most popular song is Ngomsomnye. It’s received airplay on Umhlobo Wenene FM and Tru FM. She said she will release a video for it in August. Sinovuyo said the message in her music was powerful. She’s currently working on her second album, which will be titled Ichiza. “My mother calls me Ichiza for the respect and praise I have for uQamata. I believe my singing voice is a gift from my ancestors.” Her music is available on digital platforms such as iTunes, Google Play, Amazon and Track Source.
