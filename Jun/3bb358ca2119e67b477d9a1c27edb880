GOGO Sonti Mfundisi (66) was happy when she found her stolen plasma TV at the kasi police station. But the cops wouldn’t give it to her. They told her to bring proof to show it was hers. She went home to fetch the receipt. But when she arrived back at the cop shop, the TV was allegedly gone. The gogo from Bekkersdal’s Ghana section, Gauteng claimed the cops stole her TV. She said cops have warned her to stop questioning them. They allegedly told her: “Mama, in the police station we arrest people who steal. We don’t steal. If you go on accusing us of stealing, we will arrest you!” Gogo said she first realised her 50 inch TV was gone when she woke up on Tuesday morning to watch the news. She went to the police to report the loss and that’s when she allegedly saw her TV at Bekkersdal cop shop. She said she bought the TV last year at a furniture shop in Westonaria and she has the receipt to prove it. “Cops told me they found my TV after they stopped a suspicious looking man carrying it. “They said the man dumped the TV and fled. “They then took it to the police station.” Police spokesman Constable Linkie Lefakane confirmed the TV was taken to the cop shop after a thug dropped it on the street. “Police are still investigating what happened to gogo’s TV after that.”
