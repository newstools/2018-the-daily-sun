Dudu Feleza is proud of herself. The 51-year-old from Kempton Park, Joburg runs a recycling business. She told Daily Sun her dream was to study teaching after matric. “I left home in 1995 to study teaching at the then Daveyton College of Education,” said Dudu, who is originally from the Eastern Cape. “But I couldn’t finish the course due to financial difficulties.” She looked for a job but with no luck. “I then started collecting rubbish for a living and have never looked back since,” Dudu said. She said she doesn’t regret the decision she took because her recycling business puts food on her table. “I operate near the railway line in Kempton Park and have since employed eight people. I have about 25 trolleys that are used by my workers to collect rubbish for recycling. I’m proud of what I’ve achieved.” She encouraged unemployed women to start their businesses and not wait for government to do things for them.
