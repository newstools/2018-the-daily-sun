ANOTHER taxi boss was gunned down by unknown hitmen in Motherwell NU 7 on Saturday. Vuyisile Mncokola (64) is the third taxi boss to be killed in Port Elizabeth in less than a month. He joins a long list of Border Taxi Association members who have been murdered since 2008. None of the cases have been solved. His son Zolani (27) told Daily Sun: “This was the second time my father has been shot. Last year, he was shot at nine times. He was hit only once and survived. “But this time, he was unlucky. His killers shot him five times and ran away. He was walking towards his car to go to a funeral. After being shot, he staggered as if he was praying and then he died.” Vuyisile’s brother-in-law Mpumelelo Rawana (61) said Vuyisile was an intlabi and used to communicate with his ancestors. “Now he has joined his ancestors,” he said. Church leader Zandile Makhala said Vuyisile preached at church on Saturday. “We didn’t know it was the last time. He was a speaker of truth and a real leader of the people,” he said. The police’s Captain Andre Beetge confirmed the murder. “At about 7.30am the vice- chairman of the Border Taxi Alliance was shot and killed at his home by two unknown gunmen. He died on the scene,” he said. “The motive for the killing is not known. A murder case was opened.”
