K hathide “Tshatha” Ngobe is not only a radio man, he’s also an actor. The Ukhozi FM DJ has joined the cast of e.tv’s new drama series Imbewu: The Seed. The drama was created by playwright and producer Duma Ka Ndlovu  and legendary actress Leleti Khumalo. It stars Leleti, Mpumelelo Bhulose and Thembi Mtshali-Jones, among other big names. Speaking to SunBuzz, Tshatha said: “While growing up, I always wanted to present radio shows.” Tshatha only imagined himself on radio and would even portray legendary presenters such as the late Cyril “Kansas City” Mchunu and Linda Sibiya. “I never thought I could act. This is amazing,” he said. On the drama he works at Maluju, a big company owned by shrewd businessman Zimele Bhengu, played by Mpumelelo. Tshatha said being part of the popular drama has made him realise he can actually act, and that people from rural villages have potential to do amazing things, too. “I’m originally from a deep rural area called Nongoma,” he said. “But I’ve now become an example to the young people in my rural home.” Tshatha, who’s often perceived as a deeply traditional Zulu man, said he’s grateful to the Lord. His foray into TV first came when he was given the chance to present the traditional music show Roots on SABC1.
