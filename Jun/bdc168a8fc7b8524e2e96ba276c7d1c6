ON TUESDAY, Eastern Cape Health MEC Helen Sauls-August announced infrastructure upgrade plans for Alice’s Victoria Hospital. She was speaking at the launch of the hospital’s 120th anniversary celebrations, where a sod turning ceremony marked the beginning of the upgrade. The hospital, one of Mzansi’s oldest, turns 120 in September. The first phase will see a construction company improving the hospital fence. The second phase will be the renovation of doctors’ accommodation and demolition of the neglected buildings, while the third will involve upgrading clinical services. At the launch, Sauls-August said her department had set aside R20 million to turn it into a fully furnished, modern health facility. “Victoria Hospital is in the rural areas,” she said. “So if we need doctors in these areas, we have to make sure we provide accommodation for them. But if you just look at the run-down state of these buildings, it doesn’t benefit them. Some doctors share a kitchen but have separate bedrooms. “We want to make sure they have privacy.” Victoria Hospital board chairwoman Lindiwe Makubalo said there were many challenges at the hospital. “The main problem is that it does not have enough accommodation for doctors,” she said. “These doctors don’t have a problem with working in the rural areas. But if there are other job opportunities elsewhere, they could leave us because of this poor accommodation. We’re very happy that government is trying to sort out this problem.” The construction company is expected to start working within the next week. It will finish work by July next year.
