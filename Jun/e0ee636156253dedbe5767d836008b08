PEOPLE call Donkerhoek Ko Diplastiking. Donkerhoek means dark corner and Ko Diplastiking means plastic view. For the unsmiling people of this kasi in Rustenburg, North West, life is a drag. Their houses are made of plastic! These are the more than 100 people who were chased from farms where they were born, or where their parents worked and lived. Donkerhoek is not the only place with a plastic view settlement in Rustenburg. There is another behind Correctional Services, as well as one in Boshoek near Sun City. People of Donkerhoek said farmers left them behind on a farm in Rietvlei, but the municipality said the Royal Bafokeng Administration asked them to remove them. They were evicted, and a letter stated they were being taken to a new settlement. They said instead they were thrown on the street and ended up on the abandoned farm. Some sell scrap metal, others do odd jobs, and very few are employed. They get food parcels during elections. If somebody dies, itâ€™s a crisis as it takes a long time for the authorities to remove corpses. There is no water or electricity and they lost their documents while being evicted. Their case is before court, assisted financially by taxi and other associations and EFF councillor Jane Mpolokeng. Municipal spokesman Andrew Seome, at the time of going to print, had not emailed Daily Sun the response promised three weeks ago.
