SEEING a luxury German car ekasi is no longer such a strange thing. But when one was left parked in the same spot for a whole weekend, residents of Diepkloof, Soweto got worried. The Mercedes-Benz was left abandoned on the side of a road since Friday. It is still not clear why the car was dumped there. Police said the owner of the vehicle, Dawn Basdeo (57), has been reported missing at the Brooklyn Police Station in Tshwane – but according to the cops, the car was not reported hijacked or stolen. Bheki Magubane – who repairs taxi doors near where the car was dumped – told Daily Sun: “The car was left here on Friday at about 6pm.” He said when he came back the next morning the car was still there. Residents assumed the driver had run out of petrol. “In the afternoon we became worried and decided to alert the cops,” said Bheki. He said he called the Diepkloof cop shop at about 5pm on Saturday, but when cops failed to respond as promised, he stopped a Joburg Metro Police patrol passing by yesterday morning. “There were reports that there was a body inside the car, but police searched the car and found nothing. The car was also dusted for fingerprints,” said Bheki. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said a missing person’s case was opened on Friday at Brooklyn cop shop. “The owner went missing in Waterkloof,” said Dlamini. “The car was never reported hijacked or stolen. We will look into the matter.”
