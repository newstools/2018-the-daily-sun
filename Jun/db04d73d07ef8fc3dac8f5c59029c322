MIXING different kinds of booze to boost his 4-5 nearly cost Japie Sealome his ear! The 31-year-old from Ferreira in Bloemfontein drank a mixture of whisky, brandy, beer and cider at a tavern on Friday night after a friend told him it would boost his performance in bed. But his evening with his girlfriend turned into misery when he ended up falling over and landing on his left ear on a broken mirror. Japie told Daily Sun: “I wanted to poke my girlfriend for longer and took advice from tavern patrons and friends. I mixed a few tots of whisky, brandy and cider into my beer and drank it.” Japie said while he was waiting for his 4-5 to get hard, he fell over. “I fell on to my left side and my ear was cut. “I could not believe what happened and got sober from all the booze,” he said. “I nearly lost my ear and want to advise all men not to listen to that kak advice. “I could have died. I didn’t want to go to hospital and my bosses gave me pain pills. I hope hearing in this ear will not be affected.” Fellow patron Richard Nkibe (29) said he laughed at Japie after what happened. “How can a normal person believe that a mixture of booze will boost your 4-5? Booze makes you drunk and weaker for sex, not stronger.” Japie said never again will he believe anything people tell him at taverns.
