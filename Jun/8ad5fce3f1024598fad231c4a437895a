THE customer wanted to buy legitimate cigarettes at the spaza, but the spaza owner offered him only fake, illegal ones. That was the man’s first mistake. When the man told the shop owner he did not want the cheap smokes for his five bucks, he was chased away. That was the man’s second mistake. Moments later, cops arrived to resolve the matter, only to discover the spaza shop was selling loads of fong kong cigarettes – and even dagga! The incident happened at extension 12 in Kagiso in Mogale City yesterday. The foiled customer went to police and reported that he was mistreated. Upon arriving, the cops decided to search the place and they found dagga as well as counterfeit cigarettes. The shop’s owner was arrested. Police said other members of the community of Extension 2, where the man was bust, had earlier also come to the cop shop to report the suspect. Kagiso police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya said it was police’s swift response that led to the arrest of the man. “On arrival at the given address, the team together with their crime prevention colleagues searched the suspect’s spaza. “During the search the police recovered dagga and packets of illicit cigarettes. “A case of possession of counterfeit cigarettes and dagga was opened with Kagiso police. “The suspect was arrested and later detained at Kagiso cop shop.”
