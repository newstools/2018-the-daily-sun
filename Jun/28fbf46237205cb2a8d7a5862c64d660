WHEN Langutani Makamu (17) spotted a huge hippo, he thought it was a big cow – but when he got closer he found that it was a beast from a local dam. It happened on Friday morning in the bush around Makuleke Village, outside Malamulele in Limpopo. Langutani told Daily Sun he was walking on a path through the bush from Makuleke Village to Ntlhaveni block D on Friday morning when he saw the hippo. He said he was terrified and thought it was his final day on earth. “When I saw the hippo move towards me, for a moment I thought it would kill me. I screamed in terror and ran for dear life,” Langutani said. When he looked back, however, he could not see the hippo. According to Hlupheka Mghakula of the local tribal authority, the hippo came from Makuleke Dam, about 150m from where Langutani spotted it. Hlupheka said there were many hippos in the dam. “People must be warned: these hippos are dangerous. Many years ago a local fisherman was attacked and wounded by a hippo. He later died in hospital. People must be careful,” he said.
