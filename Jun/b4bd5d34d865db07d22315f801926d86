FAKING your own kidnapping has become a hot trend in
Uganda recently. According to Daily
Monitor, the latest happened last Saturday in Mpigi District, west of
Kampala. An unnamed 15-year-old girl phoned her dad, David
Kazibwe, claiming she had been kidnapped by four men who had gang raped her and
were demanding ransom of Shs30 million (about R100 000). But before David could decide how to act, on Tuesday the
girl suddenly returned to her dad’s home, saying she had escaped from her
kidnappers. David was encouraged by friends to report the matter to
the cops to get to the bottom of the saga. Police officer Emmy Nuwagira told Daily Monitor: "The father told us that his daughter was found
at their home yesterday saying she was in pain after being gang raped by her
alleged kidnappers. When asked where she had been held and who the kidnappers
were, she failed to explain." The girl was questioned by cops, and when her story
failed to add up, they took her to Nyange Health Centre for a medical
examination. Tests showed that the girl was still a virgin – meaning her
claim of being gang raped must have been false. The girl went on to confess that she had faked her own
kidnapping. "I was tired of staying at home. So, I wanted dad to
give me money to go somewhere and start a new life," the girl said in her
police statement. The girl is currently being detained at Bujuuko copshop
and faces charges of giving false information and staging her own kidnapping
which incited the public. This is the latest in the fake kidnapping trend, with two
others being reported in the media just last week.
