THERE were a few glitches at the South African Music Awards which took place at Sun City Superbowl in North West on Saturday. Hosts Dineo Ranaka, Somizi Mhlongo and Mpho Popps made nasty comments about several celebrities who weren’t present, including Bonang Matheba. Some artists claimed the ceremony wasn’t well organised. President Cyril Ramaphosa presented Lifetime Achievement Awards to the relatives of Spokes H, Steve Kekana and Mbongeni Ngema, but they didn’t make it to the stage. Several celebrities, music fans and politicians took to Twitter to call on the Recording Industry of South Africa to host a more professional ceremony. Rapper Cassper Nyovest said: “Let’s sit down and fix the Samas.” Presenter Ursula Chikane wrote: “Guys, please go back to the drawing board.” Recording Industry CEO Nhlanhla Sibisi acknowledged avoidable mistakes were made. “Mbongeni Ngema was at the event but unfortunately he arrived late,” he said. He said some of the comments made by the hosts were not scripted.
