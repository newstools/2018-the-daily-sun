The Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters in Gauteng say they remain steadfast in their calls for the ANC's chief whip in the Gauteng legislature, Brian Hlongwa, to resign within 72 hours. On Thursday, Hlongwa survived a motion, put forward in the legislature by the DA and the EFF, for him to step down. The ANC voted against it. The two opposition parties put the motion forward following the release of a report by the Special Investigative Unit (SIU) in May, which implicated Hlongwa and other officials in alleged corrupt activities totalling R1.2bn. The allegations date back to when he was Gauteng Health MEC between 2006 and 2009. "The tabling of the motion today afforded the ANC the opportunity to take a firm stance against the rot within its ranks," DA Gauteng health spokesperson Jack Bloom said in a statement on Thursday. He said the report had been kept under wraps by former president Jacob Zuma, after the SIU handed it over last year, in an attempt to "negate damage to the ANC brand and protect Hlongwa". Zuma tasked the SIU in May 2010 with investigating the allegations. Gauteng EFF MPL Mandisa Mashego said, based on all the evidence from the SIU report, the party wanted the ANC to deal with Hlongwa the same way "they dea lt with the rest of those whom [they] took decisive actions for wrongdoing". She said Makhura should take another "bold decision", just as he had when he suspended Molebatsi Bopape, pending action by the provincial disciplinary committee (PDC). https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/brian-hlongwa-must-go-eff-da-20180629
