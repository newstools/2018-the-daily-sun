SASSA has recently been struggling with fake SMSes that confuse beneficiaries. The most recent one instructs them to re-register for their grants or they will not be paid. The SMS reads: “All Sassa recipients, please you have to re-register yourself for Sassa payments from 1 June. There will be no paypoints any more. Please collect application forms at your office from 1 June to take to bank or post office of your choice. “If you do not register, you will not get paid in August or thereafter.” However, Sassa spokesman Paseka Letsatsi has said the SMS is fake. “The contents of this SMS are misleading and cause unnecessary confusion and panic among social grant beneficiaries. Beneficiaries are urged to ignore this message as it’s incorrect,” he said. Letsatsi said beneficiaries didn’t need to re-register but were requested to swap their old Sassa cards for new ones by the end of September. “The swap can be done at local Sassa offices, paypoints or selected post offices. Beneficiaries can choose to have their money deposited into a personal bank account or could withdraw their money from ATMs.”
