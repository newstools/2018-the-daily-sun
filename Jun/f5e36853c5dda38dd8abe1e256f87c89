 THE Director of Public Prosecutions has provisionally
withdrawn the case against Thembisile Yende's murder accused, David Ngwenya. Thembisile’s family were not impressed by the decision to withdraw the case. Recently Numsa had called on Eskom to release surveillance
footage that could possibly assist with the investigation into the case. The Magistrate at Springs Magistrate's Court Daphne Jansen
Van Vuuren said the decision was made by the Director of Public Prosecutions. She said that the case was provisionally withdrawn, but the
case could be called back at any time. Ngwenya (43) who is a technician at Eskom - allegedly
murdered his lover, Yende, after he suspected that she would "spill the
beans" on his involvement in a copper cable theft syndicate. Yende's body was found 10 days after her disappearance at an
isolated Eskom substation. It was staged to look like a suicide. Ngwenya has appeared in court several times and was never
granted bail, but he was released on R15 000 bail today.
