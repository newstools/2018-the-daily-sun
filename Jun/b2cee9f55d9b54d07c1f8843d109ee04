BRADLEY Bias (42) from Molapo, Soweto said he separated from his child’s mum 13 years ago. But when they separated, they decided that the child should live with his dad. Bradley said the child’s mum is Moipone Thamae, who is originally from Lesotho. “I am not sure if she still lives in South Africa or she went back home.” Bradley told Daily Sun his daughter does not have a birth certificate. He said when he went to apply for it, he was asked about the mother. “I looked for her, but with no success,” he said. He was told to get all sorts of documents, such as birth records and affidavits, and also to do DNA tests to show the child was his, before he could apply for a birth certificate. “I did all that but still, the mother is needed.” He said the People’s Paper was his last hope. “My child has struggled all these years. I need help to find Moipone.”
