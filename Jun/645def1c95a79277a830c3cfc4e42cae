ABOUT 40 families in Siyanda, north of Durban, used to have two toilets to relieve themselves. But ever since the municipality shut down one of the toilets, they all have to use the same one. However, it appears they are not the only ones in the kasi with a toilet problem. Forty other broken and clogged toilets are in need of repair. Residents said the other toilet was closed in August because it was leaking. Nomthandazo Dlamini (37) said: “Kak was coming out of it and it had to be closed. “Ethekwini Municipality promised to fix it in October but that didn’t happen. “Now we’re sharing one toilet, which is very dangerous for men and women. “We want mayor Zandile Gumede to intervene.” Thobani Sibiya (34), another resident, said: “This situation doesn’t only pose a threat to women and children. “All of us are risk. “We might contract diseases because all of us are using one toilet. “It is not healthy. “We have reported this several times.” Councillor Mondli Zwane said he is aware of the matter. “It’s not the only toilet that needs to be fixed. “However, engineers have started fixing the other toilets in the area. “I believe they will start fixing the one that these residents are complaining about in the next two weeks.” Mthunzi Gumede, the mayor’s spokesman, said residents should consult their councillor. He said Zwane will give them feedback about the progress of the repairs. Gumede said: “The matter is being dealt with but it is the councillor who must update residents.”
