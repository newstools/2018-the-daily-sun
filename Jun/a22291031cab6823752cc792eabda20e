A man believed to be in his 50s, was found dead and trapped
inside a wrecked bakkie, after it rear-ended a truck on Tuesday morning. According to Netcare 911’s spokesperson Tebogo Magoro, Netcare
911 responded to a collision on the N4 highway near Klerksoord AH in Akasia, north
of Pretoria. “On arrival Netcare 911 found that a bakkie had rear-ended a
truck” Magoro said the fire department used Jaws of Life to free
the body from the wreckage. “Netcare 911 paramedics assessed the man and found that he
had already succumbed to his numerous, fatal injuries. Nothing could be done
for him and he was declared dead on scene,” Magoro said. He said the driver of the truck fortunately escaped injury. Local authorities were on the scene for further
investigations.
