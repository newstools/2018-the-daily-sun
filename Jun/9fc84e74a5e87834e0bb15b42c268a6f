A man was left seriously injured when his
taxi crashed into the back of a towing recovery vehicle. The incident occurred on Republic Road in
Randburg on Friday morning. ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene at 06:05 to find
both the recovery vehicle and taxi in the middle of the road. "The taxi driver
was found lying trapped in his vehicle while the driver of the recovery vehicle
was walking around on the scene. "ER24 rescue medics had to use specialized equipment to
free the trapped man from within his taxi. Once freed, paramedics assessed the
man and found that he had sustained numerous injuries, leaving him in a serious
