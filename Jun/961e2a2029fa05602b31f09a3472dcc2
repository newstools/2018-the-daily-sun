LLOYD Babedi’s positive outlook has allowed him to look beyond living with a disability. The 31-year-old from Alexandra in Joburg said when he lost his ability to walk at the age of 16, life became challenging. He had to use crutches. The call centre agent then founded a non-profit company called #ItsAMindset in 2015. He donates wheelchairs and crutches to people who can’t afford them. Lloyd told Daily Sunhe and his friends did a fund-raising event for a boy in his kasi who needed a wheelchair. “We collected the money and bought the wheelchair,” he said. “People heard about it and we started getting requests. It was then that I decided to register a non-profit company.” He said the funds to buy the wheelchairs and crutches come from donations. Last year #ItsAMindset donated 130 wheelchairs in Alexandra, Tshwane and Tembisa. “This year we will make the campaign provincial,” said Lloyd. In April, they donated eight wheelchairs in Alex, followed by five wheelchairs and a pair of crutches in Tshwane in May. This month they handed over five wheelchairs and two pairs of crutches in Tembisa. They focus on those who only have a disability grant as an income. “A person has to be unemployed and not be part of a centre or organisation that gets funding from the government.” He said people who need help can forward a motivation on WhatsApp at 062 108 0922 on why they need a wheelchair. “They must provide a name, surname, address and two pictures showing the state of their existing wheelchairs.”
