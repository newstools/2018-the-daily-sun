WHEN Lebohang Leeuw woke up on Sunday to find his house on fire, he did not think of himself. The 23-year-old jumped out of his bed and raced to save his family members, who were still asleep. Thanks to his quick thinking, no one died in the fire that destroyed his three-roomed shack in phase 10 kasi, Mangaung. However, his brother Thato suffered burn wounds and he was rushed to hospital. The family lost everything in the fire, believed to have been started by a candle Lebohang’s brother lit after the area experienced load-shedding. Lebohang told Daily Sun: “I was with my little brother Papiki (17), girlfriend Nthabeleng Tshabalala (20) and our eight-month-old daughter Kananelo when the fire started. “My brother Thato (28) was sleeping in another part of the shack. We had load-shedding and had to use candles before we went to sleep. “It looks like Thato forgot to blow out his candle when he went to sleep and the curtain caught fire.” He said when he woke up, all he could think of was his family’s safety. “I woke my wife up and told her to take the baby outside. I took Papiki out before running to rescue Thato. “He was surrounded by flames when I got there, but I managed to pull him out. He was in so much pain,” he said. “I am glad no one died in the fire, but it destroyed everything we had, including Papiki’s school uniform.” Lebohang said neighbours rushed to put out the flames, but the shack was burned to ashes. Lebohang’s sister Matshidiso (31) said since their parents died her brothers had been living in the shack. “I would have lost my whole family if it was not for my brave little brother Lebohang,” she said. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi confirmed the incident. “A case of malicious damage to property was opened. No suspects have been arrested,” she said.
