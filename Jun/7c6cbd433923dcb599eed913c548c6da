THE shack exploded in a ball of fire, threatening the entire kasi with a flaming disaster. Then six brave SunHeroes decided they could not wait for the firefighters. They jumped into action and prevented the fire from running from shack to shack in the kasi of Zandspruit, west of Joburg, on Sunday. With buckets of water they fought to control the fire, while others rushed to get more water. Others ran to neighbouring shacks to save furniture in case the fire spread. Owners of neighbouring shacks watched in horror, waiting for the fire to spread. But the men defeated the fire. Instead of many shacks burning down, only one was destroyed. The owner of the shack was not at home and nobody knew what caused the fire. By the time the fire engine arrive, the fire had been put out. One of the men told Daily Sun they had to act fast. Frans Moeng said they had to take chances to save the shacks. “We did not have time to think about it. We had to kill the fire before it burned down the kasi,” he said. Community leader Kenneth Lekalakala said shacks in Zandspruit get destroyed often because they do not have enough water in the area. “People have lost their lives. By the time the firefighters arrive, it is too late. We are proud of the men who risked their lives to extinguish the fire,” he said. “If it was not for them, we would be telling a story of people being killed and property being lost.”
