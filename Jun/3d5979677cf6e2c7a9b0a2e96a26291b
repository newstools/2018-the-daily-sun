POLICE arrested two men in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, recently on suspicion of driving a stolen car. They discovered it had a false number plate and immediately impounded it! A case had previously been opened at Mondlo in Vryheid, KZN, where the silver BMW was hijacked last year. Ekurhuleni Metro cops spokesman Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said one of the suspects claimed the hot car was his. The suspect insisted that he’d bought the car from someone. “The man, who is from KwaThema, claimed he bought the car for R100 000 from a man called Ngwenya,” said Kgasago. The 35-year-old man was charged with fraud and possession of a stolen car. He’s expected to appear in the Springs Magistrates Court soon. “Cops tracked down the seller near a filling station in  KwaThema on  Tuesday,” said Kgasago. “He was arrested and charged with selling a hijacked motor vehicle.” The 31-year-old is still behind bars.
