ONLY strangers are hired to do projects in their kasi. They don’t know where they come from but they’ve never seen them before, according to residents. On Tuesday, about one 100 angry people from Duduza, led by members of the Enough is Enough Organisation, marched to the Ekurhuleni municipal offices in Nigel. They said they wanted the municipality and local companies to employ local people. Tebogo Buyane, chairman of the organisation, said they were not linked to any political party. “We are just fighting for the people. We have municipal managers and general workers who are not from this area. “Internships are offered to people who are not from here. “How is the municipality hoping to empower our people when it takes people from outside?” Tebogo said they’ve complained several times but outsiders are always given first preference. John Beya, deputy chairman of the organisation, said: “When locals are given jobs, they work on a temporary basis. Local people have been employed as casuals for many years. The municipality is aware of these issues but they’re not doing anything about them.” Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said the municipality had an open door policy and anyone who had a complaint could state it.
