Sibanye-Stillwater has confirmed that the fifth miner who went missing at the Kloof Ikamva shaft earlier this week has been retrieve. Five miners went missing on Monday after they entered an "abandoned working place" at the Kloof Ikamva shaft. "We located him last night and he was retrieved in the early hours of the morning," Sibanye-Stillwater spokesperson James Wellsted said on Thursday. It is understood that five miners were overcome by gas and heat underground. In a statement AMCU accused the mine of forcing employees to go underground even though the Department of Mineral Resources had reportedly issued an order to stop production at the operation. “It is reported that a mine overseer . . . forced workers to go underground,” the AMCU statement said. Wellsted dismissed allegations that the workers were ordered to go underground. He said: “At this stage we are not sure why they were at the shaft, as they were not told to go. They did not follow the policy for safety procedures.”
