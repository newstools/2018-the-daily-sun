BHEKI Cele believes they are winning the fight against cash-in-transit heists. Briefing the media in Centurion, Tshwane yesterday, the police minister said three suspects were in hospital under police guard. He thanked members of the Farm Watch in Tzaneen, Limpopo who helped in the arrest of suspects involved in the cash heist on Tuesday evening. He said some police officers had been linked to cash heists and were arrested. Cele urged journalists to check their sources when reporting on cash heists. “There are a lot of fake reports on social media. Please report things as they are,” he said. Kevin Twiname, head of service delivery at the South African Banking Risk Information Centre, said they had lost cash vans worth R67 million. “This year we have had 159 incidents so far compared to last year’s 1 007,” he said. He said most of the heists took place in Gauteng.
