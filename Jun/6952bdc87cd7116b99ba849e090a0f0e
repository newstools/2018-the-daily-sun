TWO suspects aged between 23 and 36 were arrested just before
they could rob a local petrol station in Waterval outside Makhado, in Limpopo. The arrests were a result of an intelligence driven operation
in the area. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngeope said the
operation further continued at the Elim Mall, which resulted in the arrest of three
suspects aged 22 and 34 and the recovery of a firearm after they robbed a
courier van. Ngoepe said preliminary Police investigations have
revealed that the car was reported stolen at Mondeo in the Gauteng province. He said these arrested suspects are believed to be a
syndicate which was terrorising members of the community in and around the
Makhado and Thohoyandou area for some time. Provincial Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba applauded the members
of these teams from various units for cracking these crime syndicates through
their hard work. “All criminals out there who are still engaged in their
dirty tricks of terrorising members of the community including the business
community, their days are numbered because we are going to deal with them
mercilessly and without compromise” Ledwaba said.
