RESIDENTS of Foreman Road squatter camp in Clare Estate, Durban are still shocked after seeing their neighbour being killed. A 34-year-old mum of three was stabbed to death, allegedly by her boyfriend. The incident happened in the woman’s shack on Sunday. After the incident, the boyfriend apparently waited for the cops to arrest him. A neighbour told Daily Sun the woman’s boyfriend stabbed her after an argument. “The lovers used to live together but they separated three months ago because they often fought in front of the kids,” said the neighbour. “On Sunday the boyfriend arrived at the woman’s shack and they started arguing. “I then heard her screaming that her boyfriend was stabbing her. “I rushed to the woman’s shack but the door was locked. “She kept crying and I called other neighbours, but we still couldn’t open the door.” He said when the boyfriend finally opened the door, the woman was lying in a pool of her blood. “The boyfriend had stabbed her all over the body. “The man just stood there and didn’t care about what he had done. “Another resident called the police. “When the cops arrived, the boyfriend told them he’d killed his girlfriend,” said the neighbour. The neighbour said the kids were not there when the incident happened. Another neighbour said: “The man told police he killed his girlfriend because she didn’t visit him on Saturday as she had promised.” KZN cops spokesman Colonel Thulani Zwane told the People’s Paper: “I can confirm the incident that took place at the squatter camp where a 34-year-old woman was fatally stabbed by a known suspect. “The suspect (34) was arrested at the scene for murder and will appear in court soon.”
