BONGANI Mkhize (42) was born with a disability. “My parents tried everything to get my legs straightened so I could walk. I eventually accepted the fact that I was not like other kids,” he said. Bongani was diagnosed with paraplegia, a condition that weakens the muscles below the waist. Despite his condition, he’s a father of six and ward committee member in Lindelani, Greytown. “People elected me because of my positive attitude,” he said. Bongani said he heads a group in Umvoti that equips people living with disabilities with skills. “I founded the group. We teach each other how to make and sell art. The group also plays different types of sport.” Bongani is one of a few people who realise that self-pity is an unproductive emotion. “I can’t just sit back and feel sorry for myself. I need to live my life to the fullest, regardless of my condition.”
