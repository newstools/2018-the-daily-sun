THE sickening scourge of Mzansi women being murdered, in many cases by those closest to them, has to stop. This was the loud and clear call by women in Soweto who marched through the kasi on Saturday. Dressed in black and red to symbolise they were mourning, the women reminded men that without mothers, there would not be men either. The women, along with a few men, marched from Maponya Mall in Pimville to a community hall where they held discussions on how to stop this scourge. During the discussions, women agreed there was a need to report abuse immediately when it started happening. “We have also realised that when it begins, the victim thinks it’s nothing and keeps quiet, but it keeps on happening again and again until it gets out of hand. “Our message is – report it from the first day it happens to avoid it from spreading,” said organiser Dineo Sihlabo. “We want the killings to stop – as in now! “It’s painful to see kids orphaned because of an angry father or boyfriend who could not control himself.” Dineo said they also hoped cops would act swiftly on reports of abuse. At the hall, victims of abuse talked about their experiences while those who listened were brought to tears. “With this rate of the killing of women, our county is going nowhere. This needs to stop,” said Thembi Mofokeng, one of the organisers.
