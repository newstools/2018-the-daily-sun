WHEN Mokete Sethabela (50) from Thabong, Welkom was dismissed from the South African National Defence Force 2004, he never told his family what had happened. A few years later his wife allegedly left him. And in 2011, Mokete went missing and his family hasn’t seen him since. The family is appealing to SunReaders to help them find Mokete. His sister, Maleshoane Sethabela (54), said her brother was very secretive and never told them why he was dismissed from the army. “A few years later his wife took their only child and left him,” she told Daily Sun. “Mokete was depressed and he refused to talk to us.” Maleshoane said the last time she saw her brother was in February 2011. She said he had been relaxing at home but later that night he disappeared without trace. A few days later Maleshoane reported Mokete missing to the police. “Thabong cops did all in their power to help us search for him, with no success,” Maleshoane told the People’s Paper. She said since her brother’s disappearance, she had been having sleepless nights. Maleshoane said they had received calls from people who claimed to have seen her brother. “But every time we try to follow the information, it leads us nowhere.” Police spokesman Captain Malebo Khosana confirmed that a missing person’s case has been opened at Thabong Police Station. “Anyone with information about the whereabouts of Mokete should contact Thabong police on 057 910 2397/8, or the family on 072 485 3972 or 073 108 8081,” Khosana said.
