It WAS just another night for a hearse owner on Tuesday – until four men attacked him and hijacked his vehicle. But worse was yet to come. While the men were driving around with the owner in the Umthambeka section of Tembisa, Ekurhuleni on Tuesday, continually whipping him with a pistol, they stopped and picked up a woman who was hitchhiking. They raped the woman many times, forcing the hearse owner to witness their terrible crime. According to Ekurhuleni Metro Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago, the driver of the hearse was surprised when four men armed with guns entered his yard at Umthambeka and demanded his Mercedes-Benz hearse. “Apparently, while driving around, the hijackers gave a woman a lift and then took turns raping her inside the hearse,” Kgasago said. The injured driver was dumped at Entshonalanga section, where community members helped him to report the case at Tembisa Police Station. The vehicle was found on Wednesday at about 5am in Tembisa with the help of a vehicle tracking system. “It is not known what happened to the woman. The police are investigating,” said Kgasago. The men are said to be armed and dangerous and they are wanted for hijacking, rape and assault.
