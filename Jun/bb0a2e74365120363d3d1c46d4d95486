RESIDENTS of KwaMakhutha have been warned to stay indoors tomorrow when a well-known gangster is buried. Lungani Mkhize (30), who was known as Sgora, was shot and killed by an off-duty cop at a local garage in the kasi near Amanzimtoti last week. It’s believed he tried to rob the cop but the cop pulled out his gun and shot Mkhize dead. Earlier in the week, a voice note recorded by an unknown resident, warning people in the area to be careful, started circulating. In the 16-minute clip, the woman says Mkhize’s friends plan to cause chaos and want to kill a cop in revenge. The woman claims a cop will be killed before the funeral to honour the gangster. Councillor Nomvula Hlomuka said she was aware of the clip. She said she was concerned about the safety of residents and warned them to stay alert. She said although she didn’t know the person who made the warning, residents should take it seriously and stay away from the funeral. “We know the funeral is this weekend and we have received information there are people planning to cause chaos. “This practice is associated with gangsterism and gunshots are expected to be fired in the air, which puts the lives of residents at risk,” she said. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said an inquest docket was opened at KwaMakhutha Police Station after the killing. “Police are ready for the night vigil and the funeral tomorrow.”
