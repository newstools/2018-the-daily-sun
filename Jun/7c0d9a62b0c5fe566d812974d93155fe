HER dream of becoming a paramedic has been shattered. That’s because 22-year-old Lucia Motshoane doesn’t have an ID. She said she couldn’t even complete her matric. Lucia from Bela-Bela in Limpopo said she’s been sitting at home, waiting for a miracle. She told Daily Sun job opportunities have been coming her way but she couldn’t be hired without an ID. “Things have become more complicated now because I have a child and I can’t register him for a birth certificate. “I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m worried this thing will affect my son’s life.” Lucia said her 54-year-old mum Grace Motshoane also struggled to get her ID. “She only received an ID in 2010 and by then I was 14 years old. “She was happy she could finally apply for my birth certificate.” Lucia said her mum was instead advised to apply for an ID for her. “We applied for my ID in 2010 and were told by an official the process could take five to six years as the systems had changed so it didn’t matter that I was underage,” she claimed. Lucia said in 2016 she went to check on her ID but it was not there. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said: “The provincial Home Affairs manager in Limpopo has assigned officials to investigate the matter. The client will be contacted to gather further information.”
