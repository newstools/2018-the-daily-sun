Local rapper, Cassper Nyovest was recently handed a nice serving of humble pie when he flew from Mzansi to America. The self-proclaimed “Mufasa” boarded a flight to the USA yesterday, en route this year’s BET Awards where he is nominated. But, what he wasn’t ready for was that he would be flying economy for first time in three years. All of this because an upgrade would see him fork out a total of R107 000 to fly in first class and he just wasn’t about it. “First time flying economy in 3 years on an international trip and it is humbling. Wanted to upgrade my flight but it was 107 000 ngathi no ways. I’ma sit big boned ass on the aisle seat nicely. Tryna finish building these offices/studio space for Family tree,” he tweeted. So, he was sent all the way to the back of the plane. The rapper has been letting fans in on the progress he is making with the construction of the offices recently. If his social media pages are anything to go by, Family Tree will have its brand new headquarters very soon. The 2018 BET Awards will take place at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday, 24 June 2018 and will premier across the African continent on BET (DStv channel 129) on Tuesday, 26 June at 20:00 CAT. ?First time flying economy in 3 years on an international trip and it is humbling.
