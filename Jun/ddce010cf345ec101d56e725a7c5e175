AFTER Shikombiso Bila completed an IT diploma she thought she’d instantly find a job. But life didn’t turn out as she expected. She remained jobless for two years after graduating from the Tshwane University of Technology. The 26-year-old from Nghezimani Village near Malamulele, Limpopo told Daily Sun she started her clothing design business, Maxelo Style, in 2016. “I had to do something because I couldn’t afford to be unemployed. I sent countless CVs every day without getting a response. I want to challenge other graduates to get their hands dirty, even if it means volunteering.” Her mum Betty was a trader and her father Lastborn Bila worked as a welder. “I wasn’t born with a silver spoon. I never had new clothes and my school uniform was always donated by my neighbours. That’s how I learnt how to knit my own clothes.” She makes and sells woollen scarves, dresses and jerseys. “Maxelo Style is growing each year and I’m happy people support it. I named it after my son because everything I do is for him.”
