LULAMILE Sindaphi is no longer taking his TB medicine – most of the time he doesn’t have food. “I’ve stopped taking my treatment. I can’t take it on an empty stomach,” said Lulamile (57). And he rarely has the R30 taxi fare to go to the clinic. Lulamile from NU18 in Mdantsane, East London, cleans neighbours’ yards just to get food. His shack is windowless and has holes. The SunTeam found him sleeping on a wet mattress. “During heavy rain and wind, I’m always scared my shack will collapse,” he said. “I’ve nothing to eat. I think too much and end up losing my mind. I see things other people can’t see. “I see people in black clothes, chasing me. Sometimes I swear at my neighbours.” He never had problems when he was still working. A neighbour said: “He’d buy his own food, but now he relies on us and we have our own problems.” Ward Councillor Xolani Simandla said he’d tried to organise temporary shelter. “Finding these houses takes a long time. I’ll see what I can do.” Social development spokesman Gcobani Maswana askedfor Lulamile’s details. Three months’ groceries will be provided by a social worker after his assessment.
