SAPS co-ordinators will often visit initiation schools to ensure they are following the law and to make arrests where crimes have been committed. The police will also search for drugs, alcohol and illegal weapons that may be hidden in initiation huts. Dedicated cops have been assigned to investigate all initiation-related cases and to ensure they end in court. The police have appealed to parents, traditional leaders and residents to work with them to avoid deaths and injuries. They have asked parents to make sure traditional surgeons do not take on underage boys or torture initiates. Police will monitor traditional ceremonies, and will organise school campaigns to warn amakrwala about the dangers of gangsters and bulling. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga assured community members that the police would do their best to prevent deaths and ensure the initiation season was safe. “We have learned from previous experiences and formed strategic partnerships with other state organs to ensure that no crime is committed during this season,” said Ntshinga. “If crimes are committed, those responsible must be arrested. Our members will open cases and charge perpetrators for crimes ranging from illegal circumcision, torture of initiates and circumcision of underage initiates to providing false information under oath.”
