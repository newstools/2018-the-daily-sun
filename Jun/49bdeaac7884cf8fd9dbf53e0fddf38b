Wandile celebrates African excellence through storytelling. Filmmaker, producer and actor Wandile Molebatsi (33) from Molote Village in Rustenburg, North West, shows aspects of African life, such as dance, in the film Hear Me Move. He believes Africans are the best storytellers. “Look at the indigenous people like the San. Or at the film Black Panther, for example,” he said. Wandile said he’s looking forward to touching many with his latest films Rocket Boy and Mapungubwe. Rocket Boy is about Siyabulela Xuza (30), a young man from the Eastern Cape who discovers rocket fuel and wins prestigious awards. “The script is finished and ready for casting,” he said. “The movie also promotes the abilities of young South Africans who are good at maths and science.” Wandile is in Jamaica participating in the Gatffest Film Festival, where there will be workshops to address how films can deal with issues that affect the youth. “This is part of the youth celebration as it will be on June 16,” he said. Wandile has produced Guilt, Thula’s Vine and iKani with his company Coal Stove Pictures. He plays Mabitsela, the crooked cop, in Guilt. “Mabitsela is investigating missing money,” said Wandile. “In the meantime, he’s been stealing money from dodgy kasi deals.” He said cops are not that bad. “Most of them are good,” said Wandile. “During Winnie Mandela’s memorial service, my wife’s car was crashed into by a taxi driver,” he said. “The good cops took care of us and were very helpful.” iKani is a new isiNdebele drama series, its first episode will be aired on 30 September. “It’s about a young painter who’s trying to find her identity. The drama series is also about celebrating Ndebele culture.” Wandile said as a young boy he used to be amazed by late Henry Cele, who portrayed Zulu king Shaka. He also fell in love with the story of Rain Queen Modjadji of the Balobedu in Limpopo.
