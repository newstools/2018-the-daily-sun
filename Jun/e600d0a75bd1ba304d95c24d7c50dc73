IT COULD so easily have been a horror incident, but thanks to the bravery of a handful of people tragedy was averted. Patients narrowly escaped death when flames raced through the Jansenville Saurs Hospital in the Eastern Cape. Hospital management risked their lives and rescued eight patients, three nurses and a general assistant. The blaze allegedly broke out in the hospital’s casualty ward and linen room on Friday morning. Rooms were burnt to ashes within minutes. Eastern Cape Health MEC Helen Sauls-August applauded hospital management for quickly evacuating patients and staff. “No one was injured except for the general assistant who’s currently being treated at Midlands Hospital for smoke inhalation,” said the MEC. An emergency plan has been organised to provide service delivery and new admissions will be referred to the Midlands Hospital in Graaff-Reinet. That is also where the eight evacuated patients were transferred. Medical services are available at the nearby Brug Street clinic. “The cause of fire is still unknown and the hospital is currently shut down due to police investigations,” said Sauls-August. “Also, the extent of the damages is not yet known at the moment.”
