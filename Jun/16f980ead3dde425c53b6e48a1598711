“IF ONLY I had seen the smoke earlier, maybe we would be telling a different story.” These were the words of Ouma Ramokonopi, who lost two of her nephews in a fire that left her aunt and a two-year-old nephew in a critical condition. The 37-year-old from Rockville in Soweto said she lived in a shack in the yard and noticed smoke coming from the house at about 10am on Saturday when she went out to hang up the washing. “I ran to the front of the house to check what was going on and I realised the house was on fire. My biggest worry was the three children and my aunt.” Ouma told Daily Sun she knew something was wrong when she didn’t hear any screaming. “I yelled for help and the neighbours came rushing. They kicked open the front door and that’s when my aunt came falling out.” Ouma said although her aunt survived, she was badly burnt. “We tried to get inside the house to rescue the children but the fire was aggressive and we had to break the kitchen door. “I found my two-year-old nephew lying next to the bathroom door. Luckily, he was still alive. My two other nephews, aged three and seven, were found lying dead on the bed.” She said she was thankful to everyone who helped with groceries and blankets. The boys will be buried today at the family home.
