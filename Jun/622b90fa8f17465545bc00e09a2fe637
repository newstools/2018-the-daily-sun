NEWLY trained traffic cops from six Eastern Cape municipalities have been warned not to take bribes. The 27 graduates have successfully completed a one-year diploma from the Nelson Mandela Bay Traffic College in Greenbushes. Speaking to the graduates at the graduation ceremony, senior traffic officer Eric Tiso said: “We’ve lost many of our colleagues because of corruption. “A bribe is not worth your career, your family and the respect of your community or your freedom. “I’m not sending you to do corruption. Yes, you will be tempted, but think twice. “Show perseverance, have the right attitude, and adhere to principles.” Deputy director for traffic control Charles Bramwell said: “Your journey will be dangerous and full of curves and potholes. Don’t be fooled. “You’re entrusted with an important responsibility to serve and protect. Have the courage to withstand unethical behaviour.”
