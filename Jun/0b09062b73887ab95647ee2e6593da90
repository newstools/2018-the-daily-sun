Lerato
Mvelase's singing career is on the rise with every song she releases. The actor and
singer will be dropping another song, called Sthingthing, on Friday. The song has a
strong message to abusive men. Sthingthing is
a Zulu word for a moron, a good-for-nothing person or an utter fool. Lerato told SunBuzz: "A lot of women out there
are living with izithingthing. They seem to be attracted to these abusive men
who treat them like trash. This song is about cheating, directionless, the
shameless drunkards, men who refuse to support their kids and so forth." But, Lerato
said, the song is not about tearing down the men, but is about encouraging and
inspiring them. "We want
our men to love themselves so that they can be able to love their kids, wives,
partners and everybody around them," Lerato said. The song
features Mpumi Somandla, Professor, Emza and DJ Active from Helem Productions. The single is
part of the House of Helem Volume 1 compilation. The rhythm of
the song will make even the stiffest joints to attempt dancing moves. It has that
force that moves the spirit and is not easy to ignore. The combination
of Lerato and Professor's golden touch has brought up a beautiful single. Lerato is popularly
known for her acting abilities on stage and television. She has
appeared in TV productions like SABC 1 drama series Home Affairs and SABC2's
Home Sweet Home. She is
currently on Mzansi Magic's Isibaya as Lt. Mkhize.
