THE table tops were destined for Portugal but never made it onto the aircraft. Police said they acted on a tip-off on Tuesday afternoon and found 10kg of dagga hidden inside the tops. Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said Ekhuruleni Metro Police Department Tokoza officers acted on information about dodgy items that were to be taken to Portugal via a courier service. “Police investigated and found dagga in one of the five table tops in 20 500g blocks,” he said. “The table tops and dagga were booked in at Kempton Park cop shop.” Kgasago said the courier company smelled a rat when furniture at their warehouse in Isando was incorrectly invoiced and couldn’t get hold of the client to approve its transportation. “The courier company released the suspicious cargo to the officers as the prospective client had suddenly disappeared,” he said. “In-depth investigations are under way to find out how the dagga ended up in the table tops.”
