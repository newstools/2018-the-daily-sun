THE normal working day ended in tragedy when a construction worker was buried by falling rocks. The worker, a man in his early 60s, lost his life when he was crushed and buried by falling rocks while working in a six-metre deep trench at a construction site in Illiondale, Ekurhuleni. But his body was retrieved only on Sunday, three days later, as rescue workers were afraid rocks might fall on them. Ekurhuleni Disaster and Emergency Management Services spokesman William Ntladi said rescue operations started immediately, but they had to be suspended twice as assessment of the situation continued. “On arrival at the scene, an assessment was conducted and rescuers identified the body of a construction worker trapped under huge rocks in the trench. “Rescue operations commenced immediately until midnight and had to be suspended due to safety reasons. “Safety measures were put in place overnight until the following day,” said Ntladi “Rescue and recovery operations resumed on Saturday morning until the evening, without success. “Big rocks in the terrain and the depth made it difficult for the rescue team to access and recover the body out of the trench of about six metres deep. “The operation had to be suspended again until Sunday morning when it resumed,” said Ntladi. He said the worker’s body was finally retrieved on Sunday at about 6pm. Ntladi said the family of the victim were at the scene as well. “The family were given the opportunity to view the body before it was taken away by forensic pathology services. “The cause of the trench collapse is still undetermined and under police investigation,” said Ntladi Edenvale police spokesman Captain Jean Olckers confirmed the incident and said that an inquest docket was opened.
