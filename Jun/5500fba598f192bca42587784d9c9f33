Zimbabwean-born Precious Nyathi moved to Mzansi when she was 12. The 30-year-old fled that country because of the political conflict. Precious, who is from Malvern in Joburg, now has two young children. Her firstborn daughter was born in 2014 and her second last year. Precious is unable to get birth certificates. She told Daily Sun the kids are born to South African fathers, but both of them are not willing to help her. “Both of them live with their fathers,” she said. Precious fears that without birth certificates or IDs, her kids face a doomed future. “Without birth certificates, I’m unable to enrol my kids in preschool,” she said. “Home Affairs is unable to help because both fathers are refusing to come and sign documents.  I’ve been pleading with them to help me, but they keep postponing.” Precious wants to sort this out before she returns to Zimbabwe for good. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said in such cases, a handwritten birth certificate is issued to serve as proof of birth. “Precious needs to submit that to the Zimbabwean Embassy,” Mokgola told the People’s Paper.
