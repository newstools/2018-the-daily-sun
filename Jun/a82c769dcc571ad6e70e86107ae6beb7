A woman has accuses actor Jamie Foxx of slapping her face
with his 4-5 16 years ago when she refused to give him oral sex. But the actor has called the claim an 'absurd lie'. TMZ reports that the 50-year-old actor, whose real name is
Eric Marlon Bishop, allegedly tried to get the woman to perform oral sex at a
party at his house in Las Vegas in 2002. She told police
last week that when she refused, he struck her in face with his penis. The woman said that one of Foxx's friends told her she
had to leave afterwards. She said she was inspired by the #MeToo movement to file
a police report. She claims she went to hospital after returning home to
Los Angeles the following day after suffering a severe panic attack. Foxx's attorney told TMZ: 'Jamie emphatically denies that
this incident ever occurred.' She added that he will be filing a claim with the Las
Vegas police department against the woman for filing a false police report
against him. "The alleged incident was not reported to law
enforcement in 2002, or at any time in the last 16 years until last Friday
because the incident never happened,' she added. The police department lists the case as an open
investigation, however, the statute of limitations in Nevada is three years so
has run out.
