RESIDENTS of Dundee, in Endumeni Municipality, are demanding the permanent removal of mayor Siboniso Mbatha. The angry residents brought Dundee to a standstill on Wednesday. About 3 000 protesters marched to the offices of the municipality to demand that a new mayor be appointed. Before heading to the offices, the protesters blockaded all routes to the town with burning tyres and other objects. Cops used teargas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. One man was arrested for public violence. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, the man will appear in Dundee Magistrates Court today. KZN Co-operative Governance spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said the department would continue to monitor the municipality to ensure service delivery was not affected. He said the decision to remove the mayor could only be taken by his party.
