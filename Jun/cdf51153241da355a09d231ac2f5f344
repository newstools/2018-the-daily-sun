DINEO Mphunyane died 13 years ago, leaving her mum, gogo Duduzile Mphunyane (75) with her two kids. Duduzile from Pimville, Soweto said her daughter’s death has affected her a lot. She told Daily Sun her grandson, Kutlwano Mphunyane (13), doesn’t get a child support grant. “Kutlwano doesn’t get a grant because I’m battling to apply for a foster care. Social workers need his dad’s consent before they can process the application. But Kutlwano’s dad is unknown to the family. “The only thing we know is that the man is from Mozambique,” said gogo Duduzile. “Kutlwano was only two months old when his mum died.” Gogo said she had raised the children all by herself. “But my grant money wasn’t enough to raise my grandkids. “I managed to sort out my granddaughter’s matter because we knew her dad. Even though her father had died, we managed get a death certificate and applied for foster care.” She said she needed help to find Kutlwano’s dad so she could apply for foster care. “If Kutlwano’s dad is still alive, he should immediately contact me because I need to apply for a child support grant for my grandson.”
