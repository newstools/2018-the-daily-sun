LEGENDARY musician Papa Penny wants to bring real change to his home province. The singer, whose real name is Eric Nkovani, said he wants to battle Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha for the position of provincial ANC chairman. Papa Penny told Daily Sun it was time for Mathabatha to withdraw from politics as he was no longer needed. “He has done nothing for the people. This time we would prefer a Venda or Shangaan because they have been overlooked for 24 years,” he said. Papa Penny, known as the Shangaan Disco King, said the province had been led by Pedis for 24 years, which was not good for a place with many languages. “I am only ready to contest with a Venda, because they also need to be given an opportunity to lead their province,” he said. Papa Penny said many people in the province had been left behind because of tribalism coming from the premier. “People of Limpopo were united under apartheid, so why should we be divided by the current leadership?” He said he was not afraid of a challenge. “Even if I lose, I will keep my life, my pride and the support of the people,” he said. He said people who wanted to fight tribalism must vote for him, because he was prepared to free them from all their chains, including poverty. “I am here to make sure people celebrate a new dawn and to unite them.” Papa Penny said he had been participating in politics since he was a child, and he would not leave music behind as it was in his blood. He told the People’s Paper he had started campaigning, and the response had been amazing.
