THE two women thought they’d cooked up the perfect master
plan. They would move between churches in the suburbs of
Harare, Zimbabwe helping themselves secretly to things of value that could
easily fit in their hired getaway car: handbags, cellphones, laptops, even
Bibles. But their plans backfired when a tip off led to cops
searching their homes, where they discovered the allegedly stolen loot, according
to NewZimbabwe. Violet Jaure (27) and Maria Kawa (35) from Chitungwiza on
the outskirts of Harare, on Saturday appeared in court to face charges of theft
from various churches around Harare. The State alleges that on 20 May this year, Jaure and
Kawa went to a Roman Catholic Church along Wessex Road, Mabelreign in Harare
and snatched Lois Mushonga’s handbag, which contained goods to the value of $1
000 (about R12 800). Mushonga reported the theft to the Mabelreign cop shop. A week later, the two pretended to be worshippers at the Salvation
Army Church in the same suburb. A group of women were busy with choir practice
and had left their bags unattended in a pile in the church. It is alleged that
Jaure and Kawa helped themselves to valuables including Bibles, mobile phones
and laptops. On 1 June, cops swooped on Jaure’s house, where hundreds
of handbags and Bibles were reportedly recovered. It is believed they had
already sold on many other stolen valuables. Jaure then implicated Kawa. The case continues.
