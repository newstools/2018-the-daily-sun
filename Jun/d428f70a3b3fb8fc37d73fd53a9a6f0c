HARDLY a day goes by without somebody making fun of him. Samson Banda (42) of Jakkalsdans in Klipgat, North West, has a huge growth hanging under his right ear and it keeps growing every day. He covers the growth with a beanie so people don’t notice it. “I hide it because children make fun of me,” he said. He said he’s consulted various churches and sangomas, but none of them have helped. “I’ve been to a hospital. I was never booked in for an operation. I was given painkillers.” He said he couldn’t get a job. “Potential employers are afraid to hiring me. “They think I’m not fit to work because I look like this.  I have no reason to live “ This thing has taken away my happiness and turned me into a joke.” His mother Elisa (76) said Samson was born with small moles around his body. “I took him to a doctor who removed them when he was still a baby, and they didn’t grow back until he was older,” she said. “This thing is scary. I can never get used to it.” She said she fears it will end up killing him. “What if something happens and it gets removed by accident and injures him?” She said they were depending on SunReaders for help. North West health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said: “He must report to any of our facilities in Madibeng. “He could also be referred to other levels of care, depending on the assessment of his condition.”
