Despite all the drama that surrounded radio personality and activist, Criselda Dudumashe recently, it seems like things are going pretty well for her. The 49-year-old drove out of a Midrand Jaguar showroom driving a very flashy and stylish brand new car. The car is reportedly worth over R700 000. Criselda shared her new purchase with all her fans on Instagram and called Jaguar her “favourite brand”. Thank you @wesbanksa @jaguarsouthafrica @Brynstonjaguar for restoring my faith in my favorite brand. #jaguar_evermore #class #elegance #ownleague A post shared by  Criselda Kananda Dudumashe (@positivegp) on Jun 14, 2018 at 9:25am PDT  Amen! ????
