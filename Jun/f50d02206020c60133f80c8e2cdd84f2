A NINE-year-old boy was allegedly beaten by an off-duty Metro cop on Saturday. The boy from zone 2 in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane said he was playing on the street near his home when the cop and two friends accused him of stealing the valves from her car’s tyres. “The boys who stole from her ran away. She thought it was me,” said the boy. “She didn’t ask questions. Her friends held me while she slapped and punched me in the face.” The boy’s aunt said the child’s friends ran and told her what was happening. “I looked through the window and I saw women manhandling my little boy. I rushed outside to stop them,” she said. “They were having a party and it looked as if they wanted to take him inside and make fun of him. I had to intervene.” She said they told her the boy had stolen from the woman. The boy’s 41-year-old father said he received a call from the family to tell him what had happened. “I rushed home to find my boy with blood dripping from his nose.” He said he was angry but decided the best thing to do was to call the police. “It is disappointing and disgusting for someone who should know the law to do something like this,” he said. “She deserves to be suspended from her job because she’s not fit and needs to pay for what she has done to my son.” Captain Matthews Nkoadi, GaRankuwa police spokesman, said the suspect was arrested and charged with assault. “She appeared in the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrates Court yesterday and was released on bail. “She will appear again in court on 22 June,” he said.
