The ANC on Thursday confirmed 70-year-old Job Mokgoro as its North West premier candidate to replace Supra Mahumapelo. Announcing at the party's Luthuli House headquarters in Joburg, ANC Secretary general Ace Magashule said Mokgoro is "a tried and tested administrator." But Twitter is having none of it. "We are tired of old leaders," said Twitter users. They say the ANC has replaced a young person with a pensioner. They say Mokgoro is too old to lead and soem Tweeps even called him "Mkhulu" premier. They said appointing Mokgoro shows that the ANC is not interested in having young people in leadership position. Mokgoro will be sworn in as premier on Friday.
