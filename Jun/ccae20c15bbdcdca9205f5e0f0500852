VILLAGERS were shocked when a gogo was found dead in her bedroom on Friday. Alice Matshebelele’s body was found by a neighbour after the neighbour became worried as she had not been seen since the previous evening. The neighbour said the 68-year-old from Mabhobho Village in KwaBhaca, Eastern Cape, visited her house every morning. “I went to her house and there was a foul smell. “I then saw smoke coming from her room,” she said. “I called other neighbours and they pushed open the door. “We found her lying beside her burned bed.” Victoria Matshebelele, the gogo’s sister-in-law, said she rushed to the house when she saw people gathering outside. Victoria said gogo Alice lived alone as her only surviving child was looking for work in North West. “I asked her to come and live with me when she suffered a minor stroke, but she refused. “There is no electricity here, so we use paraffin lamps and candles,” she said. “She would sometimes sleep on a mattress beside her bed and it seems she fell asleep with the candle on and it fell onto the mattress. “I think she fell over trying to escape the fire but could not find the door. “We will miss her as she made us all laugh.” Mount Frere police spokeswoman Captain Edith Mjoko confirmed that an elderly woman was found dead in her bedroom. “We found her beside her badly burned bed and mattress. We think a candle might have caused the fire and no foul play is suspected. An inquest docket was opened,” she said.
