SPHIWE DEMANDED to know if the builders, who stood outside the gate instead of working, were drunk. They told him they were not and said he should go and see what they had found in the outbuilding. WE FOUND A BABY’S COFFIN IN THE BACKROOM, THEY TOLD HIM. It was on Wednesday when Sphiwe Motoba (40) walked towards the outbuilding in Hammanskral, Tshwane, to see what the workers were talking about. He couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw the buried baby coffin! He phoned sangoma Dada Lukowe, who came and opened the coffin. They found two animal skins, a spear, muthi in a bottle, and beads. Lukowe said the muthi was not meant for Sphiwe, but that he suffered the ill effects because the house belonged to him. Lukowe said the previous house owner had buried the coffin as a ritual to get rich, but somebody had to die every year for that to happen. “That owner sold his house because he could no longer offer sacrifices,” he said. “The muthi was creating chaos in Sphiwe’s life because the owner is dead. The muthi drove Sphiwe’s wife away.” Sphiwe said he was angry and frightened, but he was relieved the coffin had been found. “We’d hear things moving around the house at night and my money would disappear,” he said. “I fought a lot with my wife and she left me with our two kids.” He said he was hopeful his wife would come back, now that the muthi had been found. “I will now enjoy life like I did before moving in two years ago,” he said. He said he’d persuade the builders to go back to work. “I’m sure they’ll come back. They left their tools behind,” saidSphiwe. He said if the owner was still alive, he would have demanded his money back and given him the house. “He should’ve taken the coffin with him when he moved out,” he said. “I’ve spent a lot of money on sangomas and prophets because of him.”
