THE Springboks gave Mzansi a reason to smile when they beat the English in the second rugby test in Bloemfontein on Saturday. But a group of pickpockets were smiling even more broadly, as they allegedly stole cellphones from unsuspecting fans to the tune of R50 000. But their wide grins were wiped off their faces when cops nabbed the suspects as they sat in their silver Audi A4 early on Sunday morning. The four men, aged between 32 and 46 and believed to be from Gauteng, allegedly target big events, where they go on pickpocketing sprees. Parkweg cops said they had recorded about 30 cases of pickpocketing in which the victims alleged their cellphones were stolen at the Free State Toyota Stadium. Police spokesman Captain Chaka Marope said when cops inspected the vehicle, they discovered eight cellphones hidden underneath the seat. The suspects failed to provide cops with proof of ownership. Chaka asked anyone who had lost their cellphone at the stadium to visit the Parkweg Exhibit store with their IDs and proof of ownership. The suspects are expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistratesâ€™ Court soon on charges of possession of suspected stolen property.
