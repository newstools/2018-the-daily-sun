A CASE of murder was opened following the death of a schoolboy yesterday. The 16-year-old was allegedly shot dead by his dad at Fred Norman Secondary School in Ennerdale, south of Joburg. The 50-year-old father took his son to school for an evening study group. Earlier yesterday, there were reports that the father was sleeping in the car inside the premises after dropping off his son. The son went back to the car and knocked on the window, scaring his father who allegedly pulled out a gun and shot in the direction of the son. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the school yesterday. Education spokesman Steve Mabona said they do not want to go into details about the incident. “The police are investigating the case,” he said. “We are also interested to find out what really happened.” Mabona added that pupils claim the father and son were seen arguing on Tuesday. “According to information at our disposal teachers said they witnessed a quarrel between the two.” Captain Mpande Khoza, spokesman for the Soweto West cluster, said a case of murder had been opened. “The father will appear in the Protea Magistrates Court today to face a murder charge.”
