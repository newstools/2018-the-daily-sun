THESE residents claim the government understands only one language. On Monday they spoke that language when they took to the streets, barricading the entrance to Kanana in Moremela, Mpumalanga, with rocks and burning tyres. They claimed the Thaba Chweu Municipality turned a blind eye to their grievances and that every time they called community meetings, officials failed to attend. Meisi Mokone told Daily Sun there were a lot of issues that worried residents, chief among them the lack of water. She claimed they were not consulted when the Integrated Development Plan’s budget was passed. “If the community was involved in the passing of the plan’s budget, the municipality would have known about our challenges,” said Mokone. She also claimed their ward councillor, Kgotso Segodi, never attended meetings. “He is supposed to be the one taking our concerns forward, but instead he ignores us and never bothers to show up.” Residents also accused Segodi of hiring only women in the Expanded Public Works Programme. However, Segodi said the residents were consulted and present when the development plan was adopted and that the issue about favouring women was not true. He invited Daily Sun to visit all expanded programmes in the municipality to confirm that men were also employed. Tiny Mabuza, speaker of the municipality, told residents they needed to send a delegation to meet with it to find solutions.
