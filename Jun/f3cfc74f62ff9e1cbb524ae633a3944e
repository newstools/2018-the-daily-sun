SOUTH AFRICA’s athletics superstar Wayde “Dreamer” van Niekerk hopes his 43.03 – The Wayde van Niekerk Story documentary will inspire kids to dream big. The premier of the documentary took place at Montecasino Cinema, north of Jozi. It was attended by Springbok captain Siya Kolisi, his teammate Tendai “Beast” Mtawarira and the golden girl of Mzansi athletics Caster Semenya, among other celebs, big sports personalities and politicians. Speaking just moments before the screening, Wayde said he wanted to be remembered as the greatest athlete in the history of the sport. His sponsor, T-System, and the movie producers followed the global superstar and his family for two years to produce the documentary every sports fanatic will want to watch. The world record holder, Olympic and world 400m champion, will be back on the tracks in early 2019. He said his list of achievements were just the beginning, as he hoped to break his own world record, set during the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Said Wayde: “My story can be related to that of many kids out there with so much potential, but get lost along the way because of a lack of support. “I hope my story can be a form of motivation to some of these kids who go through difficulty to continue chasing their dreams and not giving up along the way.” Wayde, who is injured at the moment, will go back to Europe for rehabilitation soon. He said: “Recovery is going well. I’m in a good space right now. When I’m back on the tracks, it’ll be like I’ve never left.” Wayde said it was a blessing in disguise that his injury came during a non-Olympic or world championship year. Insisted Wayde: “I don’t have to rush the healing process because there’s no major championship this year. “Once the body has fully recovered, I’ll come back stronger.”
