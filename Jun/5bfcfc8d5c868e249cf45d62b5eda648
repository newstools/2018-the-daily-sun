PEOPLE who went to their local police station on Friday were turned back without getting help. This is because the Protea Glen cop shop in Soweto was a crime scene! This came after a man walked into the police station and went up to a police officer in a passage. Before she knew what was going on, he had allegedly grabbed her firearm and tried to shoot at her. According to a source, tragedy was prevented when the gun miraculously jammed. “That is when the cop managed to escape unharmed. The suspect then took out the magazine and found the gun was fully loaded. He started firing shots, but no one was hit,” said the source. “The man then pointed the gun at himself and killed himself right in the cop shop.” A cop said they did not know why the gun jammed. “We would be talking a different story now if it had fired,” he said. Joseph Shabalala, who was at the police station to open a case against his abusive son, said he was disappointed not to get help. Police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said the incident was being investigated. She said according to the 23-year-old man’s family, he had earlier jumped out of a vehicle transporting him to hospital. “He allegedly ran into the client service centre at Protea Glen Police Station, where he got hold of a service firearm which he discharged on himself,” said Peters. “Police have opened an inquest docket, while a case of robbery of a firearm will also be investigated.”
