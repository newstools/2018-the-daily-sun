National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss Shaun Abrahams has
poured cold water on former president Jacob Zuma's request to stay his
corruption matter. Zuma wanted the corruption case to 'stay' pending the
resolution of his issues around legal fees. Abrahams said in a letter written to Zuma's lawyers on
Monday: "I regrettably cannot accede to your request for a 'stay of proceedings
in all criminal and allied matters'." NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku told News24 that Abrahams
turned down the request. "We confirm that the NDPP (National Director of Public
Prosecutions) has written to the legal representatives of the former president
advising them that he cannot accede to their request. The matter will appear in court and all the issues relating
to the matter will be ventilated in court." Zuma is expected to appear in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court
in Durban on Friday. Zuma's attorney Michael Hulley had previously tolthat he
"terminated" the services of counsel for the case. When asked if he himself had resigned as Zuma's attorney,
Hulley responded: "No, I haven't. I have had to terminate counsel's briefs
in the matter because of the uncertainty around [legal] fees." SOURCE: NEWS24
