VERY few have enjoyed a dream Springbok debut quite like the one newbie S’bu Nkosi experienced in his maiden Test match at the weekend. The emotion of taking his first step into the international arena did little to overwhelm Nkosi, who helped South Africa edge England 42-39 in the first of their three-match Test series at Ellis Park Stadium on Saturday. The 22-year-old took to his Bok career like a duck to water and his name was on everyone’s lips following his two fantastic tries and bone-crunching tackles. For obvious reasons, the spotlight was fixed on Siya Kolisi, who made history as the first black Springbok captain. But Nkosi’s outstanding debut also will be remembered for years to come. “It was a memorable debut. With a burning chest due to the high altitude it’s hard to forget a debut like this! I don’t think I’ll forget this day very soon,” said Nkosi. “It’s a huge honour to score on my debut. The team didn’t start on the front foot. But the older guys did well to bring us into the circle, telling us to calm down, it’s a Test match. It does happen. The little bit of nerves I did experience was diminished quickly by the older guys. “It was very exciting to score. I did my best to keep calm afterwards. It was still early in the game and I understood I still had the entire game to play, and that I couldn’t get comfortable just because I scored a try in a Springbok jersey.” Kolisi also had his nervy moments, being the 61st Boks captain. But he led one of the most amazing comebacks in team history. Said Kolisi: “Obviously I was very nervous. Luckily the guys have been in situations like that before. The most important thing was to play as a team. We did what we wanted to do, the hard work we put in during the week paid off.” The Boks arrived in Bloemfontein yesterday to resume preparations for the second Test at Free State Stadium on Saturday.
