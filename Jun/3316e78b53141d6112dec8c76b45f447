THREE mine workers have been confirmed dead at Sibanye-Stillwater Kloof mine, close to Westonaria. It is understood that five mineers were overcome by gas and heat underground. Mine head of investor relations James Wellsted said yesterday five workers entered the abandoned area at Ikamva shaft without following safety procedures. “Three mine workers were retrieved and declared dead. One has been located and one more is still missing,” he said. In a statement AMCU accused the mine of forcing employees to go underground even though the Department of Mineral Resources had reportedly issued an order to stop production at the operation. “It is reported that a mine overseer . . . forced workers to go underground,” the AMCU statement said. The incident happened at around 6am in the morning. Wellsted dismissed allegations that the workers were ordered to go underground. He said: “At this stage we are not sure why they were at the shaft, as they were not told to go. They did not follow the policy for safety procedures.” Wellsted confirmed that three were dead, one located and one still missing.
