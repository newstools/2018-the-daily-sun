THEY have been asking nicely for reliable basic services in their area. But residents of Phake Village, Mpumalanga, claim their pleas have fallen on their councillors’ deaf ears. And now they’ve threatened to follow the example of other communities and rise up in protest to make sure they’re heard. They told Daily Sun their councillor wasn’t helping them to get basic services. They said they’ve been living without a proper water supply and electricity for almost 10 years. Peter Matlala, a resident, said the villagers wanted to have electricity and clean, quality water every day. He said they were being neglected and there hadn’t been development in the past 10 years. “We’re being refused a simple basic need: water,” he said. “Now that it’s winter, we’re going to suffer even more because of the lack of electricity.” Shirley Nkwinika, another resident, said if protesting will help them get basic services, then that’s what they will do. But the councillor, Ben Lehong, said residents were staying on privately owned land and the owner had refused to have the place electrified. He said the municipality had been supplying water to residents every Wednesday. But they were now refusing to use it and claiming it was dirty. “We’ve been trying to provide services to the villagers but they’ve been refusing to use them,” he said. He said there’s nothing more they can do.
