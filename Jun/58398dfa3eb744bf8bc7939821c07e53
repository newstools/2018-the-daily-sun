HIS first mistake was wearing a very distinctive outfit while robbing. His second mistake was that instead of getting rid of the clothes, he hung on to them! And when cops searched his house, they found the same outfit! The suspect allegedly robbed a business in Spartan, Kempton Park, on 14 May with other accomplices – but they were picked up by CCTV cameras. One man’s clothes stood out so much, that on Friday cops hit the jackpot when they spotted a man resembling the suspect driving in a car with a woman in Lekaneng section of Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. Spokesman for the EMPD, Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago, said they received a tip-off that enabled cops to catch the suspect. “During an armed robbery at least two of the assailants were caught on CCTV,” said Kgasago. The EMPD Community Liaison Unit members tracked down one of the two suspects seen on the video footage. “The suspect was spotted at Lekaneng section driving in a blue Ford Focus with a female passenger. The suspect’s residence in Lekaneng was searched and clothing matching those on the video footage were found.” “Although the 28-year-old suspect denied involvement in the Spartan armed robbery, he was detained at Kempton Police Station.” He said the suspect is expected to appear in the Kempton Park magistrates court today.
