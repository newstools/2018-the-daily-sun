Earlier this month, protesting workers
vandalised parts of the Charlotte Maxeke Hospital over unpaid bonuses. Now criminal charges have been opened
against those who violently disrupted the hospital in the last two months. PICS AND VIDEO: WORKERS TRASH HOSPITAL! This is according to MPL Jack Bloom. He said this was revealed by the Gauteng
Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa in an oral reply to his questions in the Gauteng
Legislature on Tuesday. According to reports, the aggrieved staff
cost an overall damage of nearly R3 million during the protest action. During the protest action, doors were
broken, medical waste was trashed in the casualty section and taps were left
running to flood the hospital. Bloom said: “Ramokgopa said that the
charges included malicious damage to property, intimidation and attempted
murder.” Bloom said police are looking at the
footage of the CCTV cameras to identify the perpetrators. “I hope the police do a proper
investigation that can secure convictions in court,” said Bloom. He said in the past, perpetrators of
violence at health facilities didn’t face the law because of police
incompetence in collecting evidence. “There should be tough consequences for
those who trash a hospital and threaten the staff as well as patients.
Hospitals should be a place of healing without any violence,” added Bloom.
