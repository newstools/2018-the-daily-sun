RESIDENTS are furious with a mum who allegedly beat three girls before burning them with a hot knife! The mum from Inanda, north of Durban, allegedly attacked her daughter and two nieces aged between 11 and 15 after accusing them of stealing R100 on Friday night. The 45-year-old woman, who’s a street vendor, apparently heated up the knife on the stove and told the girls to take off their clothes and lie down before burning them on their bums, arms and legs. The neighbours were woken up by the girls’ cries. They went to the house to see what was going on and were shocked to find the girls had been burned. Neighbour Florence Molise (57) said she was told about the incident by her daughter and went to the house on Saturday. “The mum wasn’t there. But I found two girls who told me what she had done. The third girl had left with her mum,” she said. “I contacted the cops and we took the two girls to the clinic. When they returned from the clinic, I kept them at my house.” Florence said residents called the cops again in the afternoon and gathered outside the mum’s house with the councillor to wait for her. “When she arrived cops took her away. We want the children taken away from her,” she said. The mum told the SunTeam: “These children always steal from me. That’s why I decided to beat them.” Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of assault was opened at Ntuzuma Police Station. “The mum was arrested and is due to appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court soon.” Social development spokesman Vukani Mbhele said they will send social workers to provide support to the girls.
