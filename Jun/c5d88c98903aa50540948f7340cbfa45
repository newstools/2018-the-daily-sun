AMAZULU have started negotiations with Orlando Pirates for the services of Thembela Sikhakhane. The full-back spent the 2017-18 season on loan at Usuthu and now the Durban club wants to keep him permanently. Sikhakhane joined Pirates from Golden Arrows at the beginning of last season and was loaned out to AmaZulu without kicking a ball for the Buccaneers. He played a huge role in helping Usuthu remain in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) after they bought their way back into the elite league at the beginning of the past season. AmaZulu team manager Qedi Dlamini confirmed the development to SunSport and said they had already talked to Pirates about their interest in the Ulundi-born defender. Said Dlamini: “We want him and we’ve spoken to Pirates about it. We don’t think they have a problem with our request. Negotiations are currently underway and our general manager (Lunga Sokhela) is on top of it.” Dlamini also revealed that they are working tirelessly to tie up their two strikers, Siyabonga Nomvethe and Mabhuti Khenyeza, for next season. The two veterans’ current contracts with Usuthu expire at the end of the month, but the club management have already offered them new ones to consider. “We are still talking to them. We will soon announce how the talks went,” added Dlamini. Meanwhile, AmaZulu’s case against the PSL for the loss of their top eight position following the controversial case of Ajax Cape Town and Tendai Ndoro, will be heard on 14 and 15 June, the club says. Usuthu successfully lodged their complaint over the weekend and the league will hear their submission over those two days.
