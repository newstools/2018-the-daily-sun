MEXICANS jumping for joy on Sunday shook the ground hard
enough to set off earthquake detectors and throngs danced in the streets after
their team scored a surprise victory over World Cup defending champion Germany. Delighted fans waved Mexican flags and donned traditional
“sombrero” hats at the iconic Angel of Independence monument in downtown Mexico
City as they sang the country’s unofficial soccer anthem, “Cielito Lindo,” or
“Pretty Little Sky,” a popular folksong. In the city’s massive main square, families in Mexican
football jerseys had watched on a giant screen in front of a towering cathedral
as Mexico beat Germany 1-0 in Moscow. When star player Hirving Lozano scored a goal in the 35th
minute, supporters jumped up and down, shouting, “Yes, we did it!” The Institute of Geological and Atmospheric
Investigations said highly sensitive earthquake sensors registered tremors at
two sites in the capital seven seconds after the game’s 35th minute. It called
them an “artificial” quake. “El Tri,” as the team is called in homage to Mexico’s
three-color flag, has failed make it to the round of 16 in the last six World
Cups. Mexico will face South Korea in its next game on Saturday
in Rostov-on-Dov, Russia.
