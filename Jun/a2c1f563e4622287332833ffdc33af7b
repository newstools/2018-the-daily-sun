RESIDENTS of Barberton were told on Friday not to wait for the police minister to solve their crime problems. Speaking on behalf of Mpumalanga Community Safety MEC Pat Ngomane at a crime prevention indaba, Mbombela public safety MMC Majaheni Nyalunga encouraged residents to take the lead in fighting crime. “We do not need Minister Bheki Cele. We can be our own Bheki Cele,” he said. “We cannot wait for somebody to come through the N4. We can assist ourselves.” Nyalunga said the streets had been taken over by thugs who did as they pleased. “We need to look at possible ways of dealing with them and put a stop to any criminal acts,” he said. Nyalunga said unemployment and substance abuse appeared to be the biggest contributors to crime in the area. He said illegal mining and gang activity were also causing problems. “We cannot leave our houses because of a few individuals. If we want to win the fight against crime, let us stand for the law and not against it,” he said. Community members said they wanted the cops in the province to redeploy special units, including the tactical response team, to deal with crime. Resident Mandla Dlamini said the level of crime in the area was getting out of hand. “We are living in fear. Our lives are in danger because of a few individuals,” he said. The community safety department said a task team would be formed to make sure all resolutions adopted at the meeting were implemented.
