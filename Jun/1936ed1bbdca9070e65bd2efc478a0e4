SYLVESTER Matswake may have a disability, but this didn’t stop her from taking matters into her own hands. Sylvester and others living with disabilities said they’re gatvol of being mistreated by landlords while waiting for RDPs. So they’re invading houses! The 33-year-old from Kaalfontein in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, spoke to the SunTeam on Saturday after people living with various disabilities, including albinism and blindness, invaded empty RDPs in Clayville extension 45. She said she’s been on the waiting list for years. “It’s very difficult to live with a landlord because, as a disabled person, you need someone to help you clean up,” she said. “You need someone to help you throw away bath water. Landlords give us problems, but so does the government. “It’s as if they don’t want us, but when they campaign for votes they fetch us.” John Ramaotswa (35) from Kaalfontein, who was born with one hand, said it wasn’t fair able-bodied people got houses while they were left stranded. “We’re voters and we want those houses lawfully, but if we don’t get them lawfully we’ll take them by force. We know our rights.” Ekurhuleni Human Settlements MMC Lesiba Mpya told Daily Sun: “When people illegally occupy government property, the law must takes its course. “We’re working tirelessly to ensure the housing backlog is addressed. “But that doesn’t mean people must resort to occupying land when things get tough. “Former Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Paul Mashatile has said we must not neglect those living with disabilities.”
