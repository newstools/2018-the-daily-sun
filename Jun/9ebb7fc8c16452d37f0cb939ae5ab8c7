A burnt body of an unknown person was found in the bushes, in Dwaalboom outside
Bela-Bela. The chilling discovery was reportedly made on Tuesday midnight
by community members next to one of the local farms, who then Â immediately alerted the police. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the police responded
immediately together with the Medical Emergency Services. "On arrival at
the scene of crime, they found a body of an unknown person who might be in
his/her thirties burnt beyond recognition," Ngoepe said. He said the cause of death is unknown at this stage, but the
post-mortem will tell - as it is still to be conducted. Ngoepe further indicated that the race, gender and
nationality of the deceased is still unknown. "This is because the area where this body was found, is
on the boarder of Limpopo and North West - so the person might be from one of the
two provinces," Ngoepe mentioned. He urged anyone who might have any information regarding the
matter to contact Detective Warrant Officer Benjamin Kwata at 082 736 5174 or
the crime stop number 08600 10111.
