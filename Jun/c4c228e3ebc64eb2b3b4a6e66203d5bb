A NURSE from Tonga Hospital in Mpumalanga could find herself in hot water after allegedly assaulting a woman who is six months pregnant. Ncobile Mhawule (30) was referred by the clinic to the hospital on Tuesday after collapsing at work. Ncobile, who was suffering from abdominal pain, told Daily Sun that upon her arrival she went to the nurse for help, but was told she was late. “I couldn’t sit properly because of the pain. I had to stretch my legs. “The nurse ordered me to get out of her sight because I was annoying her. “She said if I wanted to sit comfortably, I should find another place. I ignored her, but she kept provoking me,” claimed Ncobile. She said she went back to the casualty ward where another nurse assisted her and told her to go back to the ward where she had been sitting. “The nurse who had been rude to me, came and pushed me off the chair. “She called another guy to come and assist her to remove me, but they had a misunderstanding. “I grabbed the chair and sat down, but she came back and pushed me again.” Ncobile said she was shocked because she went there as a sick person but ended up being a victim. “I still don’t know what I did wrong to the nurse to deserve such bad treatment.” Mpumalanga Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said they had received a complaint and were investigating the matter. “The department has communicated with Tonga Hospital management about the alleged disagreement between a woman patient and a nurse. “The complaints committee will call the woman after the matter has been thoroughly investigated,” said Malamule.
