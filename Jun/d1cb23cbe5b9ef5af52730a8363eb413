International music DJ, Nkosinathi Maphumulo is continuing to prove that the Black Coffee reign just wonâ€™t let up. The South African-born DJ, music producer and businessman has shared his gig guide for the months of June and July. And although none of his stops will be in SA, it is still pretty impressive that a one-man show can have 36 stops in a matter of two months. The Black Coffee Summer Tour will hit Frankfurt, Ibiza, Milan, Zurich, Madrid, Moscow and Las Vegas, to name a few. Despite this very heavy schedule, Black Coffee is expected to hit Mzansi shores in the near future to attend and play at the Axe Party of the Year. His next studio is due for release in August 2018 and will feature Akon and Pharrell Williams.
