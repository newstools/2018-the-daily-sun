Can you believe it has been 10 years since Leslie Mampe aka Da L.E.S released his debut album? Fresh 2 Def was released in 2008 under Les’ previous label, Ghetto Ruff. The album was produced by Bongani Fassie who later became a huge deal in the music business. According to the 32-year-old rapper, the whole album was a labour of love and every single thing was done with immaculate attention to detail. “This album changed our lives forever. I really hope it inspired and is remembered for what it’s done for SA Hip Hop today. Bongani Fassie produced the whole thing with his bare hands, I wrote every single lyric from my heart, Lance Stehr hand delivered every single radio station,” he tweeted. Congratulations to Da L.E.S..
