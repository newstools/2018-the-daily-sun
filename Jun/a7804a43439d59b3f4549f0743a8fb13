BANYANA BANYANA midfielder Leandra Smeda has promised an improved performance in their final leg of the 2018 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers against Lesotho. Banyana will lock horns with Lesotho later on today in the second leg of the qualifiers at Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium (3pm). The girls will be hoping to book their spot in the Afcon, which takes place in Ghana from 17 November to 1 December. Banyana are going into this encounter with a 1-0 lead, which they claimed in Lesotho on Wednesday. The worse result they could get and still qualify would be a draw, which the players are not even thinking of. Smeda says in order for them to conquer, an early goal would play a massive role because it would put them in control of the encounter. She said: “Everyone in the team knows that the job is not yet done. “Away in Lesotho we were supposed to score many goals, but our poor performance and lack of killer instinct saw us scoring only one goal, which was not good enough. “We know that qualifying for next year’s World Cup is one of the major things that’s expected from us, so there’s that pressure which we need to overcome.” Smeda also stressed that the national women’ side have to be just as sharp in front of goal when it comes to grinding for the required results in major tournaments, such as the Women’s Afcon, which will also serve as the 2019 Fifa Women’s World Cup qualifier. If they qualify for the African Women’s Championship, Banyana will need to finish in top spot in order to qualify for the World Cup showpiece, which will be played in France early next year. Added Smeda: “We will need to give it our best because the margin is not that huge and Lesotho will want to fight back. “The only way for us to win this match wil be to convert the chances we create, which has been one of our challenges.” Smeda has been one of the consistent players from club level (University of Western Cape) to national team in the past few years.
