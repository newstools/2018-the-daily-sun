Born Nsikayezwe David Junior Ngcobo, Hiphop singer and songwriter Nasty C is well on his way to making his mark in the South African Music industry. Nasty C who got signed by Universal music earlier this year shares that being part of the Universal Music family is the coolest thing after leaving Mabala Noise. Raised by his father after his mother passed on when he was only 11 months old, Nasty C told Daily Sun that he is very happy that he will be spending Father’s Day with his father and he holds him very dearly. “I don’t know what I would do without my father, he raised me and made me the person that I am today, so I can’t think of anything I would rather do on the day since my trip to Cape Town has been cancelled. “ As the youngest recipient of the Best Freshman Award at the South African Hip Hop Awards 2015, Nasty C says that he had to overcome having a low self-confidence to get where he is today. “I used to have a low self-esteem and had to overcome that. I remind myself constantly why I do what I do and who I do it for and that drives me to stay relevant” he told Daily Sun Nasty is dropping two single, namely King and Jungle which can be found on digital platforms and will be performing them for the 1st time at the Soweto Jazz Festival which will be taking place from the 14th till the 17th of June at the Soweto Theater and says that people should expect a lot of energy and “I think from here my fans can expect a lot of music and music videos, Jungle music Video, King Music Video, the album, the Ivyson tour and a lot of other collaborations and other international acts.” He says. Nasty C’s next tour will be heading to Kenya on July 28th at the Ngong Racecourse alongside Kojo Funds and a lot of other amazing talents.
