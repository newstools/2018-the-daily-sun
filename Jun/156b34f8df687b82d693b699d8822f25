POLICE had their hands full trying to ward off desperate residents who wanted to lay their hands on what they believed was gold. The Umuziwabantu Municipality had to put up a fence around KwaMachi Village in Harding, southern KZN, to stop the residents from getting in. They also sent guards to assist the overwhelmed police. Residents, including gogos and madalas, armed with shovels, picks and spades, allegedly overpowered police and cut off the fence. They are said to have flocked in, in full view of police and security guards on Wednesday night. Police had to use rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Mayor Dixie Nciki said she received a call on Wednesday that the situation was getting out of hand. “I had to send additional guards and they told me residents had cut the fence in full view of the police and got inside,” said Nciki. She said they thought fencing the area would prevent residents from getting in. “We will meet with the police and other stakeholders to discuss this gold matter because it’s getting out of control. “We’re afraid there will be deaths and serious injuries if we don’t deal with this now,” she said. She said a sample had been taken to be tested to determine if it really was gold. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said residents had cut the fence and police had to use tear gas to disperse the crowd. “Police are at the scene to monitor the situation,” said Gwala. A 29-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene after he was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm suspected to have been stolen in Pinetown in June last year. “The suspect appeared in the Harding Magistrates Court yesterday,” said Gwala.
