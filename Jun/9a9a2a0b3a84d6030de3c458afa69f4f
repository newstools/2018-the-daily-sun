KZN Finance MEC Belinda Scott has said the killing of politicians in the province especially in Pietermaritzburg, is worrying. While delivering the keynote address during a prayer meeting at the town’s city hall on Tuesday afternoon, she urged religious leaders to take the lead in fighting political murders and other social ills. “We need to protect those among us who are in trouble. I’m concerned that the region is leading the pack in political killings,” she said. Her speech came as investigations into the killing of political figures continued. The last politician to be killed was former Msunduzi Councillor Alpha “Maqatha” Mchunu. The ANC activist was gunned down outside his home last month. Scott said she was following Premier Willies Mchunu’s call to turn the tide against the killings. She said the province was also struggling with very high rates of teenage pregnancy and HIV. “Over and above that is the drug addiction and the moral waywardness of many of our young people. We cannot do this on our own,” she said. Scott said while religious leaders had a role to play, parents and other organisations also needed to help deal with challenges in the community.
