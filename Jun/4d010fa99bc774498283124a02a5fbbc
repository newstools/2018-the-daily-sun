National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and National Union of
Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) are expected to hold a one day shutdown at
Eskom on Thursday over salary negotiations. This even though many workers being banned from striking, as
they are believed to render essential services. The two unions wants a 15% increase across the board, a
housing allowance increase of R2 000, the banning of labour brokers and the
insourcing of workers such as cleaners and security guards. In a statement said Eskom it sympathises with its over 47
000 employees who have worked very hard to help keep the lights on during the
past financial year. "However, due to the difficult financial situation that
the company currently faces, Eskom has decided to offer no salary increases
this year," it said in a statement. Eskom said it has noted the statements made by the trade
unions about their intentions to embark on an industrial action this Thursday. "Eskom has been designated as an essential service
provider, and therefore our employees are reminded that they are not allowed to
participate in strike actions. In an effort to ensure security of power supply, Eskom will
activate its contingency measures should the industrial action take
place," Eskom added. Eskom says it will continue to provide regular updates about
the state of the power system through various media platforms.
