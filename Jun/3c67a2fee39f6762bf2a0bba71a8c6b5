PAIN and sorrow was written all over the faces of the mourners. One family buried eight of their loved ones in one day, at one place. Nontlupheko (60), Dumile (44), Wanda (29), Sisipho (14), Abongile (9), Athenkosi (7) and Endinako (6) Bangani, and Mvano Junior Nyambeni (2) were buried in Jarha Village, Cofimvaba in the Eastern Cape on Saturday. They all died a horrific and gruesome death when their shack in Taiwan, Khayelitsha, Cape Town, was allegedly torched by a bitter woman as they slept. The sad incident happened on the night of 7 May. Family member Zakhele Bangani said he received a call from his neighbour about the fire in Taiwan but didn’t respond since he was tired. “When they called again, I rushed to the area. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw the badly burnt bodies of my cousin and her grandchildren,” he said. Mkholwane Mthembu – who lost his mother, cousins and nephews – said he was told about a fight between his cousin Yonela, who is the mother of one of the kids who died, and a woman over some change that the woman claimed Yonela owed her. “The other woman allegedly poured petrol over the shack and started the fire. I don’t know more than that,” said Zakhele. “The whole family is deeply hurt and traumatised by this terrible incident. It will take us years to heal. We need prayers.” Khayelitsha Councillor Ntomboxolo Kopman thanked all those who supported the family in their darkest hour. “We are one big family united in one goal,” she said. “We thank Old Mutual for transporting the bodies. “We also thank Mthathi and Amadikela funeral societies for providing coffins, and the Great Commission Ministers Network pastors for spiritual and financial help. “The pastors contributed towards rebuilding and furnishing the family home.” Kopman confirmed that a woman has been arrested in connection with the deaths.
