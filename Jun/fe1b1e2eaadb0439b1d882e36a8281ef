HE ROBBED his victim of a cellphone, but he didn’t get far. Even hiding in an outside toilet didn’t help him. The victim (21) flagged down a police patrol car. He pointed in the direction the running 20-year-old alleged cellphone snatcher took. Cops from Bohlokong kasi, in Bethlehem in the Free State, were hot on his heels. When he realised the police were chasing him, he looked around for a place to hide. But if he thought he would evade the cops by hiding in an outside toilet, he was mistaken. Captain Zweli Mohobeleli said: “The victim stopped a police patrol van and showed them where the suspect had fled after his cellphone was stolen.” Mohobeleli said the suspect was found hiding in a house in the area. “While the cops were searching the premises, one of them followed a hunch and went to check the outside toilet. “The suspect was found hiding inside. The stolen cellphone, a knife and a suspected car jamming device were found in his possession,” said Mohobeleli. “He was charged with theft, possession of a dangerous weapon and a suspected car jamming device.”
