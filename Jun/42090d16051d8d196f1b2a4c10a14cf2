THE family of a woman who was found dead in her house on Tuesday is hoping that her killer will be bust soon. Nonhlanhla Khubisa (52) was found dead by cops and her family in Savannah Park near Mari-annhill, KZN on Tuesday. Her brother, Sthembiso Khubisa, said they suspected she was raped before being strangled, because they found her body half-naked and her clothing scattered around the house. “She had marks on her neck.” Sthembiso said his sister had sent an SMS to a colleague asking him to come to her house because she was being attacked by her boyfriend, who had accused her of cheating. “The SMS said that the cops should not be told,” Sthembiso told Daily Sun. “Suspecting that it could be serious, as Nonhlanhla did not come to work, the colleague came to my house to inform us.” Sthembiso said they went to her house and found the gate locked but the front door open. They called the police, who jumped over the fence and went into the house. Cops found Nonhlanhla’s body lying on the floor. Sthembiso said a pair of his sister’s panties was found in the sink, another on top of her lunch box and the third over a door handle. “Her body was also starting to decompose. We think the suspect sent the SMS days after her death so that we would go and check,” he said. “Whoever did this had the whole time to do it without any disturbance, because my sister lived alone. “We just hope that the cops find the suspect and arrest him soon.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of murder was opened at Mariannhill cop shop. “No arrest has been made. “The motive for her killing is not known,” Zwane told the People’s Paper.
