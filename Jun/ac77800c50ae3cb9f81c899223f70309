THE South African Post Office (SAPO) says it has exchanged
over one million beneficiaries’ cards to the new South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) card. This after the Post Office was gazetted as the preferred
payment channel for all social grants in South Africa. “The first million beneficiaries do not include those
beneficiaries that have willingly opted to take up Postbank Mzansi accounts as
their preferred payment method,” Sapo COO Lindiwe Kwele. The old white SASSA card will be phased out by end of
September. According to SAPO, card exchanging can be done at SASSA
offices nationally and at SASSA pay-points. “The post office and SASSA have deployed teams throughout
the country where dedicated temporary card swap sites are established using
existing infrastructure such as municipality halls to expedite the migration to
the new card. “This will ensure that as many people as possible are put onto
the new SASSA cards before the end of August. We call on social grants beneficiaries to swap their cards
and to not leave it to the last minute,” Kwele said. The post office will soon also become a card swap channel
nationally.
