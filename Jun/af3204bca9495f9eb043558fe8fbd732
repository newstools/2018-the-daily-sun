TIYENI Monyela (33) borrowed money to buy a job. Now the mashonisa is threatening to kick her out of her shack in Diepsloot, Joburg. Tiyeni had been unemployed for months when she heard jobs were being “sold” at low prices. She was in a taxi in February when a passenger told her she knew someone who took cash for jobs. “The woman gave me a number and told me to call it,” she said. Tiyeni borrowed R400 from the mashonisa so she could apply for a job. “The woman I called for a job said I would be employed by the end of the following week, but I’m still waiting.” To make matters worse, she hasn’t been able to pay back the loan. “The mashonisa wanted to confiscate some of my belongings. “But there was nothing in my shack for her to take. Now she wants the entire shack.” Although she might be homeless by end of the month, she harbours no grudge against the mashonisa. She blamed the woman who promised her a job for the mess she’s in. “She’s ignoring my calls. When she does pick up the phone, she calls me stupid for contacting her.” Daily Sun spoke to the mashonisa, who confirmed she lent Tiyeni R400 at a monthly interest rate of 50%. “That was in February. Now she owes me more than R2 000,” she said. The mashonisa said although she doesn’t want to take Tiyeni’s shack, she doesn’t have much of a choice. “I’m just running a business,” she said. Daily Sun called the woman who claimed to be selling jobs, but her phone went to voicemail.
