DA leader Mmusi Maimane visited Lansdowne Bottling Company in Cape Town on Thursday. The company has played a leading role in the Western Cape government’s Energy Security Game Changer programme. The programme wants to reduce the industrial sector’s energy demand by 10% in two years. Since the company started using solar energy in 2015, the business has become less reliant on Eskom. With less money spent on buying electricity, the company was able to focus on growing the business and creating jobs. Maimane said: “The people who are creating jobs are our heroes. I am happy with what I see at the company.” Jeran Patel, the owner of the bottling company, said: “We have been in business for more than 50 years and this visit has motivated us to work harder. The company has over 100 employees and we hope to hire more people.” Western Cape Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde said his department is impressed with the way the business is run. “It is encouraging to see them making such progress,” said Winde. Maimane said despite the effects of the drought, Western Cape continues to see the highest year-on-year employment increase in the country. According to Winde, 123 000 new jobs were created over the past year. He said: “That’s 75% of all the jobs created in the country in the past year.”
