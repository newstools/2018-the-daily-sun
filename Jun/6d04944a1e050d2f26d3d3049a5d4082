A white primary school teacher in Midrand has allegedly called a black Grade 1 pupil a monkey. The Noordwyk Primary School teacher allegedly said this in front of the boy's classmates. Following that the six-year-old boy went to report the incident to the deputy principal. It's reported that the incident took place last Friday. According to the child's mother, the pupil reportedly had an argument with another boy in class, who had taken his eraser. The boy's mother told Sowetan Live that the boy could not concentrate as he insisted that his eraser be returned. "The class teacher said he was disturbing the class and she sent him to another class. In that class, the teacher wanted someone to go and wash the blackboard cloth. "Even though a lot of kids volunteered, she said 'I will send this monkey ... here monkey, go and wash the cloth [referring to the boy]'. I won't let my son be a victim of racism." "I went to the school to find out what was the problem. They told me what happened, saying they will investigate why the teacher called my child a monkey." The mother said the teacher admitted she called her son a monkey. She said the teacher added that she meant no harm as she usually calls other pupils "love monkeys". The mom said she felt let down by the school and was angry because the teacher was only issued with a verbal warning. According to Sowetan Live the principal Lynelle Eloff said she could not comment on the matter as it was with the department. Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi said the department will leave no stone unturned to get to the bottom of this matter. "We will always promote social cohesion in all our schools. No educator will be allowed to utter any derogatory remarks in our environment," Lesufi said.
