THE South African Reserve Bank (SARB) will be launching its
first commemorative banknote, in celebration of the first democratically
elected president Nelson Mandela’s birth centenary. The notes will include the R10, R20, R50, R100 and R200. "As part of the celebrations, the South African Mint, a
subsidiary of the SARB, will also be issuing a new commemorative circulation R5
coin. As part of the preparations for the launch, test packs of
the commemorative banknotes were made available to members of the broader cash
industry to allow them to make adequate preparations in relation to issues such
as adaption's of cash processing and cash dispensing machines, ticketing machines
and so forth," the Bank said. The bank explained that while test packs were governed by
strict confidentiality provisions, it has come to the SARB’s attention that
certain breaches had occurred. "As a result some of the designs have been circulating
on social media" According to the bank in order to avoid confusion and
unnecessary speculation, the SARB has decided to release all the designs ahead
of the official launch scheduled for 13 July 2018.
