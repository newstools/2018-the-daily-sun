A DESPERATE man who claimed he was tired of life was
saved from certain death by power being restored to the electric pole he was
clinging to. According to Punch,
the unnamed man in his late thirties climbed an electric pole near a restaurant
in Port Harcourt, southern Nigeria at about 11pm on Sunday. His cries of despair
drew a large crowd, who spent hours trying to persuade him to come down from
the pole. He said he was all alone without any help now that his
parents had died and couldn’t go on. Among those pleading with him was the general overseer of
a popular church, who promised to give him N1 million (about R35 200) if he
climbed down to safety. But he refused, and was apparently seen touching some
naked wires inside the electric transformers on the poles. Unfortunately for the would-be suicide, the area’s power
happened to be out at the time. But then about a little later, the power came on again
... An eyewitness known only as Ben said: “About 30 minutes after
the pastor left, the man touched one of the high tension cables and the thing
threw him up in the air before he landed unconscious on the ground.” “We revived him. As soon as he regained consciousness,
this man rushed to climb the pole again, but we stopped him. It was at that
point that some cops, who were on patrol, came and took him away.” Eyewitnesses said some of the man’s skin had been
stripped away by the electric shock. Punch was
unable to get comment on the incident from the cops.
