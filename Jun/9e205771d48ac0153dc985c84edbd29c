ABAHLALI BaseMjondolo have blamed the death on Monday of a four-year-old boy in Ekuphumuleni in Pinetown, west of Durban, on the municipality. Khanyisani Dlamini died while playing with friends. Spokesman Xolani Khambule said Khanyisani slipped and fell on an exposed live wire. He admitted that Khanyisani’s family, along with other residents, had invaded the vacant RDPs 10 years ago. “We’re blaming the death on the municipality,” he said. “It can’t be possible that there was no budget set aside for electrifying these houses before they were even built. “They haven’t given them electricity because they’re punishing them for invading houses.” He said the organisation does not blame people for invading RDPs, citing failure in their attempts to address corruption in RDP allocation as the reason. Apparently, the municipality stopped providing services after the invasion, so residents resorted to making izinyoka. “Our position as a movement is that we fully support self-organised connections to electricity, water and sanitation when these services are not provided or are removed,” he said. Hlengiwe Dlamini (43), Khanyisani’s gogo, said: “The wire is not covered and has been like that for many years. “Khanyisani, along with other kids, used to play near that area and they were careful not to step on the wire. “But it happened and he was killed.” Municipal spokesman Mthunzi Gumede sent his condolences to the family of the child. “We won’t comment on abahlali’s accusations,” he said. “We don’t want to use the child’s death as a tool to get into an argument with them.”
