A 48-year-old man is in custody in central Uganda after
allegedly moering his brother to death because he took a mielie from his garden
without his permission. According to Daily Monitor, the unnamed man lost his
temper with his brother, Bosco Opio (22) after he bust him roasting the stolen
mielie on Friday at their home. The suspect then fled the village in Apac District where
they lived when angry villagers tried to hang him. Cops hunted him down and arrested him on Sunday. Cop in charge of investigating the case, Pamela Aguti, is
quoted as saying: “It is very unfortunate that a person can decide to kill his
own brother just over a piece of maize. This is so primitive and I think people
need to change and value life. How can someone take away the life of another
person in this way?” He will appear soon in court to face a murder charge.
