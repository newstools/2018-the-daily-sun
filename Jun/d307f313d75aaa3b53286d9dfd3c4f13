THESE gogos are happy and active. They are members of Go Tsamaya Ke Bophelo in Simunye, near Westonaria, Gauteng. The group was started by madala Alexander Sambo (63) in February this year. Alexander said he started the group to help the gogos keep fit. The gogos also play soccer. They exercise from Monday to Friday at 4 until 6pm. “When I started the group, I visited the gogos at their homes, encouraging them to join me for the training sessions. The response was positive and today many gogos are members of the group,” Alexander told Daily Sun. He said the gogos had stopped complaining of pain and other health issues since joining the group. Regina Seadi (53) told the People’s Paper she was happy to be a member of the group. “Since I started training, my health has improved a lot. “Before joining the training sessions, I had a spinal cord problem and couldn’t sleep at night due to my back pain,” she said. “But now I’m completely healed. “The doctor was even shocked that I feel so well.” Another gogo, Ayanda Hendrick, said: “Since I started attending the training sessions I have stopped using painkillers and my high blood pressure is no longer high. “Nurses at the clinic are impressed and they encouraged me not to stop exercising.” Alexander said he was organising a 5km walk to attract more gogos to join the group. “The walk will be held on 16 July. The aim is to attract more elderly women to join our group. “But the walk won’t be limited to gogos only. “Everyone in the area is welcome to join us on the day,” he told the People’s Paper.
