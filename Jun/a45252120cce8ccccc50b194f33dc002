TWICE he raised Mzansi’s flag at the highest point on Earth. His first attempt also made him the first black man to reach the top of Mount Everest. Yesterday Mzansi’s brave mountaineer, Sibusiso Vilane (47), touched down at OR Tambo airport to a warm Mzansi welcome following his third attempt to reach the top of Everest. But while Vilane didn’t get to achieve his dream again, he told Daily Sun he attempted to reach the peak without the help of extra oxygen. Few people have ever been able to climb the mountain without extra oxygen as the air is extremely thin so high up. Vilane climbed the south side of Everest, clad from head to toe in South Africa gear, with his trademark buff wrapped around his wrist. He said climbing Earth’s highest point was his way of showing his fellow Africans that anybody can do anything if they committed to hard work. “It’s good to be back home. I have another mountain to plan for and to go and climb,” Vilane said. “I always wondered how high I could climb without the use of oxygen and the answer was very clear,” he said. “People thought I was going for the summit, but I have been there twice. “If I had got to the top without oxygen I would have been happier, but this was to gauge my own natural ability. “Getting to about 8000m without oxygen for me was amazing. I believed I could do it and I did it. “I was very sad but not disappointed. I was sitting on 7 900m when I developed a terrible cough. I realised that had I gone on it would cause complications. “I made the right decision to turn around and walk down the mountain,” he said. Vilane thanked his sponsors who helped him make the journey.
