PASSENGERS on a flying bus told Daily Sun they felt lucky to be alive. “All we could do was pray as the bus flew. Our prayers worked because we were saved,” said some of the survivors of the bus crash on the N12 near the Xavier Street off-ramp in Joburg yesterday morning. The injured survivors, who are being treated at Lilian Ngoyi Clinic in Diepkloof, Soweto, said they didn’t know what caused the driver to lose control. “But I think speeding and sleeping at the wheel was the cause,” said Siphokazi Nontaka. She said she was going to Tshwane from Mthatha, Eastern Cape. She said the driver who drove from Mthatha drove smoothly, but the relief driver they picked up on the way was rough.“He was speeding and people were complaining,” she said. “There was silence for a while and then the bus started flying. Then there were screams.” Another passenger said she asked God to save her and her son. “Our prayers were heard because we came out with minor injuries,” she said. Traffic came to a standstill on the N12 as the road was closed. Two people were reported dead. Other injured passengers were taken to various hospitals. JMPD spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said two people died. He said the bus had 64 passengers and 29 were injured. The driver was charged with culpable homicide and reckless driving.
