Moshe Ndiki has quickly become one of Mzansi’s favourite entertainers, after his funny videos trended on social media and YouTube, the star rode the wave and never looked back. The Uyangthanda presenter has been putting in the work in the industry ever since and he is not shy to show off the rewards from his efforts. The hard working 31 year-old is currently enjoying a well deserved "one man" vacation in Mozambique where he took in all the beautiful sights and weather the country has to offer. Of course, he took to social media to share some pictures of himself having a wonderful time and enjoying the beautiful cuisine that Mozambique is famous for.
