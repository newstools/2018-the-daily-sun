MOST pupils focus on the final exams more than the mid-year exams! But this is a mistake. Pupils across Mzansi will be sitting to write these exams in a few weeks’ time. Peter Kriel, general manager at The Independent Institute of Education, said mid-year exams play a key but specific role in each grade. He gave a few reasons why the mid-year exams should be taken seriously. “From grade 8, exams should be viewed as laying the foundation before building a house with bricks and cement, and finishing with the roof.” How do each grade’s mid-year exams matter? Grade 8 Grade 8 is when pupils start understanding their strengths and interests. “You’ll start seeing what you’re good at, and what needs more work if you are going to succeed in a specific subject.” Pupils should start applying these insights to start focusing their thinking around what they want to study after school. Grade 9 These mid-year exams dictate the likely future success in a subject. It’s also the chance a pupil can use to switch to a different subject – it is not too late at this stage – to ensure a better average mark in years to come. Grade 10 As in grade 9, poor mid-year results may indicate that the pupil needs to replace a subject that isn’t working out. This is the last chance for the pupil to make such a change. Grade 11 Mid-year exams are more significant than before as pupils can already use these marks to apply to higher education institutions. Applying early also removes lots of stress when matric finals come around. Grade 12 Matric mid-year exams should be used to apply to a higher education institution. “If you haven’t yet applied, make sure you do so as soon as possible.”
