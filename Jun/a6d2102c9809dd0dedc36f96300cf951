A gang of hijackers have returned an 11-month-old baby girl,
who was in the vehicle they had hijacked in Avoca, north of Durban, safely to
her mom. Shortly after hijacking the baby's mother's Mercedes Benz on
Monday night, the hijackers turned the car around after realising the baby was
in the back seat, police said. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said on Tuesday
that the car was later recovered. A case of carjacking is being investigated. "It is alleged yesterday (Monday) at 18:25, the victim
was driving her vehicle out of the driveway at Partham Road in Avoca, with her
11-month-old baby in the car, when she noticed a silver VW Polo drive past her.
The vehicle stopped a few metres away and three unknown men came running
towards her. At gunpoint they forced her out," she said. Mbhele said the armed men then fled the scene in the complainant’s
white Mercedes Benz. 'Showed some heart' Andreas Mathios, community and media liaison officer for
private security company Blue Security, said the men, who "showed some
heart", did not realise that the baby was seated on the back seat when
they hijacked the vehicle. "But as they fled the scene, they noticed that the baby
was still sitting in the back seat of the vehicle. They stopped the car and
returned the child to the victim," Mathios said in a statement. He said the hijackers then fled in the stolen vehicle, which
also contained the victim’s purse, keys and cellphone. "A vehicle tracking firm later traced and recovered the
vehicle," he said. Mathios later told News24 that when he got to the crime
scene, one of their security guards told him the family had already left for
counselling. NEWS24
