THE KZN Education Department says its investigation into alleged sexual misconduct by some of the male teachers at Adams College in the south of Durban is close to establishing the facts. Allegations of sexual misconduct levelled at teachers of the school were made public by some former pupils, who took to social media earlier this month. SGB chairman Musa Zulu said they were in contact with the department and had been updated on the progress of the investigation. “As parents, all we want is justice. If these allegations are true, the department must make sure the perpetrators get the punishment they deserve,” said Zulu. “We send our children to school to get an education, not for their future to be ruined by people who are supposed to brighten it.” KZN Education spokesman S’celo Khuzwayo said the department was treating the matter as a priority because they wanted to set an example that sexual relations between teachers and pupils were unlawful. “We are very close to finding the facts. Our investigating team is making sure that it leaves no stone unturned, because at the end of the day we want the department’s name to be cleared and justice to be done,” said Khuzwayo. He said the department would also make sure that such allegations did not jeopardise the good record held by Adams College.
