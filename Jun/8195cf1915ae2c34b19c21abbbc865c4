Caster Semenya has cruised to victory in the 800m event at the Diamond League meeting held in Oslo. With a very strong field assembled on the night, Semenya led for all of the race once the pacemaker had dropped away. She strode away from her opposition down the final straight, winning by around five metres and stopping the clock in a time of 1:57.25. Semenya was followed home by Francine Niyonsaba (Burundi) who took second in a time of 1:58.57 and Habitam Alemu (Ethiopia) who finished third in 1:58.58. Semenya continues to dominate the 800m event despite a new IAAF ruling that from November 1, all athletes classified asÂ  "hyper-androgynous" will have to take medication so their testosterone levels can be lowered. This is applicable for distances from 400m to a mile and will include the 800m and 1500m events, those in which Semenya competes.
