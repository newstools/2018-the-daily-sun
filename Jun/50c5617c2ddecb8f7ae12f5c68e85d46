ALL hell broke loose at an airport in Java, Indonesia on Monday when an angry passenger joked that he had a bomb on board. Terrified passengers forced the Lion Air’s plane door open and climbed on to the engine and wing to escape – even though the engine was still running, according to The Mirror. No one was killed but some passengers were injured when they slide to the ground off the engine. The man who made the bomb threat was reportedly later arrested.
