THE State yesterday withdrew its case against former acting police commissioner General Khomotso Phahlane, his wife Beauty and car dealer Durand Snyman. This after the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Tshwane denied the State’s application to postpone the matter for three months. The State had asked for the matter to be postponed to allow the Independent Police Investigative Directorate more time to complete its investigation. The court ruled that a further delay in the case would prejudice Phahlane and his co-accused. When the three appeared in court in March, the State told the magistrate it was ready to set a date to go to trial. But yesterday the prosecutor explained that the investigation had expanded, several forensic reports were still outstanding and that more accused may be added to the charge sheet. The magistrate said there was too much uncertainty and there was no clear indication that even if the matter was postponed for three months, the State would be ready to proceed to trial. The three face charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. It was alleged that Snyman gave the Phahlanes’ vehicles which were paid for by a police contractor who received billions in forensic contracts. They made their first appearances in February and were each released on R10 000 bail when the case was postponed for further investigation.
