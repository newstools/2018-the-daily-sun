A MAN gatvol of badly fixed potholes decided to draw attention to the problem by spray painting 4-5s around the offending patches. According to New Zealand Herald, Geoff Upson from Auckland took the extreme action after complaining about the broken road for 18 months to the authorities, with no joy.  Geoff said heâ€™d seen the 4-5 strategy work in other countries. "I've seen it overseas, someone has done the same thing. They drew penises around the potholes and the council was forced to fix the potholes because people started complaining about the penises," he says in the video. Do you think it would work in Mzansi?
