A CASH-IN-TRANSIT van was robbed in the Krugersdorp CBD, Gauteng yesterday. Randfontein police spokeswoman Captain Appel Ernst said the security guards had stopped at a filling station to collect money when the incident happened. “When the guards left the filling station, they were confronted by five armed men,” said Ernst. “The men opened fire on the vehicle and fled with the bag of cash,” he said. Ernst said the suspects fled in a white Toyota double-cab. “They fled along Paardekraal Road in Krugersdorp.” She said the police later found the discarded money bag near Yusuf Dadoo Hospital. No injuries were reported. Cops have urged anyone who might be able to assist with information to call 08600 10111. “Information may be given anonymously,” Ernst said.
