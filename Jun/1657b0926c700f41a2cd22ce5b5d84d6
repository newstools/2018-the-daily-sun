Kaizer Chiefs have announced they have parted ways with five players ahead of their pre-season preparations for the 2018/19 season Amakhosi confirmed the release of William Twala, Keagan Buchanan, Edmore Chirambadare, as well as Sibusiso Khumalo and Tsepo Masilela while striker Emmanuel Letlolo will be loaned out to get more game time. Letlotlo, who made a name for himself in the Multichoice Diski Challenge was promoted to the first team two seasons ago but have not enjoyed playing in the Amahosi A-team as he has been injury prone. He missed last season through a serious knee injury and is expected to leave on a loan deal for the upcoming season, with negotiations still ongoing, according to the club's statement. Masilela's six years stint with Amakhosi is set to come to an end at the end of June, and the club confirmed that it will be not be renewed. Twala spent last season on loan at Maritzburg United, while Chirambadare and Khumalo struggled to make it in the Chiefs line up, they made less than five apparances, both of them. Quoted from the club's statement, Chiefs manager Bobby Motaung said: “We are terminating the contracts of Twala, Buchanan, Chirambadare and Khumalo." “These players are immensely talented, but couldn’t find their form with us. We do not want to keep a good player inactive and that’s why we will allow them to express their talents elsewhere.”
