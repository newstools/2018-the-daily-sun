HIGHER education and training deputy minister Buti Manamela has urged people from all walks of life to fight violence against women. He was speaking at the department’s gender-based violence imbizo at Coastal KZN TVET College in Umlazi, south of Durban, yesterday. Hundreds of students from tertiary institutions around Durban attended the event, which was organised after the killing of Mangosuthu University of Technology student Zolile Khumalo (21). Zolile was gunned down, allegedly by her ex-lover Thabani Mzolo, at her student residence in the Durban CBD last month. Manamela said: “We call on all stakeholders to join hands and shame perpetrators. “Let’s all make it our responsibility for action to be taken against them.” The deputy minister called on all higher learning institutions to beef up their security and make sure students are kept safe. SRC president Sbonelo Nzimakwe asked the government to make sure students have their basic needs met so they can avoid abusive men. Popular actor Sello Maake Ka-Ncube told male students he wanted to remind them that they didn’t have a right to women’s bodies. “Let’s be able to control ourselves. We are supposed to protect women, not make them feel less safe around us.”
