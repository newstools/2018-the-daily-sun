"One of our employees entered a gully and they were busy with the night shift cleaning, so basically he was hit by a scraper. He was fatally injured," spokesperson James Wellsted said on Tuesday morning. Wellsted said the death was still under investigation. The death toll at Sibanye-Stillwaterâ€™s operations this year alone stands at over 20, close to half of the fatalities in the entire mining industry. Five miners went missing over two ago after they entered an "abandoned working place" at the Kloof Ikamva shaft. It is understood that the five miners were overcome by gas and heat underground. AMCU accused the mine of forcing employees to go underground even though the Department of Mineral Resources had reportedly issued an order to stop production at the operation.
