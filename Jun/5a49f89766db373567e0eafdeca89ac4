THE Joburg Metro police (JMPD) have shouldered the blame for the recent FNB Stadium traffic delays. But in the same breath, they have highlighted the critical factors that contributed to the chaos, which nearly marred the high-profile Barcelona and Mamelodi Sundowns friendly two weeks ago. The metro cops came in for harsh criticism from fans, the Stadium Management and their commercial partners SAIL, after some fans missed a large chunk of the Nelson Mandela centenary match due to traffic congestion. But the story doesn’t end there… In a press conference yesterday, JMPD spokesman, Wayne Minnaar underlined some of the contributing factors: JMPD Chief Superintendent, Angie Mokasi said: “As metro police we are taking full responsibility for the delays during the match. We have factors that contributed to the delays and those reasons were raised during the plenary meeting, like the kick-off time which, however, fell on deaf ears. Fans have tendency of arriving 30 minutes before kick-off. We couldn’t create any miracle. “For a sold-out event of more than 80 000 people you need 20 000 parking bays. And the infrastructure around stadium does not even allow for 10 000 or 15 000 bays. If 20 000 people come in their cars, you will need around five hours to ensure they are in designated parking areas using four lanes. There is a time factor around everything.” Mokasi added she was surprised Stadium Management didn’t take responsibility for selling parking tickets around the stadium. She said: “As JMPD we are taking the blame because we’ve allowed those things to happen. Going forward, it’s not going to happen. It’s going to be park and ride… whether the organisers like or not.”
