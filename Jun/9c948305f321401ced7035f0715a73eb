Flora Mhlanga
(56) from Siyandhani village outside Giyani in Limpopo runs a chisa nyama that
changed her life for the better. The mum of four
told Daily Sun that she started her chisa nyama business in the year 2000, after she lost her job as a domestic worker. She said her
four children’s grant helped her to
start a business, instead of waiting to
receive a grant every month which didn't satisfy the needs of her family. "I’m happy
now because three of my children are grown and managed to get good education
through my Chisa Nyama," Flora said. She said many young women have worked at her business before
they started their own businesses. Flora said
between 2000 and 2010 the business was booming because it was new in the area
and she used to make lots of money. One of her
employee Thandi Maringa said she was unemployed until she started working at
the chisa nyama a year ago. Maringa urged
the local municipality to assist through their Local Economic Development (LED)
to empower rural women to start their own business.
