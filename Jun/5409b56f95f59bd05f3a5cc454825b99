GOGO Ellen Mokotong (79) should be enjoying her retirement. But instead she lives in fear of her abusive 27-year-old granddaughter! The granddaughter allegedly verbally abuses her daily and once even threw a bucket full of her urine at the gogo. This apparently happens under the watch of the gogo’s daughter, the mother of the rude grandchild. To avoid the constant abuse, gogo Ellen stays at her neighbours during the day when the granddaughter is home and comes back at night to sleep. Gogo Ellen claimed the abuse has been going on for years. “My daughter is afraid of her own daughter. I know she doesn’t like the way she treats me but she fears her. “She insults her too and demands her salary every month,” the gogo claimed. Police spokeswoman Captain Augustine Selepe said gogo Ellen should apply for a protection order from the nearest magistrates court or contact the police. She said any other person may apply on her behalf, either, family, neighbour or social worker. Selepe also asked for gogo’s address so that she could alert the Atteridgeville Police Station commander.
