THE Nigerian Prisons Service has arrested a woman for allegedly smuggling drugs into the country’s main jail. The woman was bust at the Kuje Maximum Security Prison in Abuja earlier this week. Prison officials said the drugs, apparently dagga, were hidden in a box of biscuits. The biscuits were part of a parcel that included milk, clothes and about R90 in cash. The illegal substance was discovered during a routine search of visitors, prompting the arrest of the suspect. When the woman was questioned by prison officials, she said she did not know what was inside the box. – CAJ NEWS
