YESTERDAY, many couples waited patiently at Mboro’s church to get help to remove troublesome punani tokoloshes. Mboro said a tokoloshe fighting a united couple can never win and prayed for all of them. “I HAVE DECLARED WAR ON BEDROOM TOKOLO-SHES!” HE SAID. People with fertility, tokolo-she and other problems stood waiting in line at the Incredible Happenings Ministries church in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, for Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng to deliver them from their bedroom headaches. Many congregants testified after allegedly being delivered from punani tokoloshes. “There was always something creeping inside me,” said a young woman. “At times I’d see a creature with beads. “I went to different doctors but nothing worked and no one knew what was wrong. “I then visited the church. After the prayers the creature is gone and I feel fine.” Dudu Mamabolo (38), who had been praying with the pastor, took to the podium to tell her story. “I had serious punani problems and went to see many doctors, but they could only fix the problems for a little while,” she said. Dudu said when she first came to the church she could hardly walk. “Mboro prayed for me and I stood up and the pain was gone. Today I’m expecting a child.” Addressing his congregation, Mboro said women have often told him it’s not only men who have bedroom issues. “Female congregants have demanded that I help deliver them from their bedroom problems, especially tokoloshes,” he said. “There are women who feel cold when touched by their partners. They have so much anger and can’t sleep with their men because of tokoloshes.”
