TWO thieves who tried to rob a restaurant were shot dead by cops and the South
African National Defence Force (SANDF) in Tonga, near Malelane in Mpumalanga. The armed duo allegedly entered the restaurant around 18:00,
and demanded money and cell phones from staff members. Police spokesperson Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe, said members of
the SANDF who were in the neighbourhood were notified by a community member of
the robbery. Bhembe said when they arrived, the robbers started shooting at the soldiers and
the soldiers called for backup from the police and the nearby army base. “The area was cordoned off and the suspects hid in the
ceiling,” Bhembe said. Following that they reportedly continued shooting from the
ceiling where they were hiding. The cops and the soldiers fired back and the suspects fell
from the ceiling into a furniture shop next to the restaurant. “They were certified dead at the scene by paramedics and a firearm
with live rounds was recovered. No other injuries were reported,” Bhembe added. The IPID was informed and they will be conducting their own
investigation.
