THE car thieves thought they would have an easy day on the job. After their first theft went off without a hitch, they tried to pull off the next. Only this time they were spotted by a member of the public who called the cops. When the police pounced on them, the suspects tried to flee but only managed to crash their stolen prize into a traffic light. Ekurhuleni metro spokesman Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said cops were chasing the suspects on Friday when the driver crashed into a traffic light in Boksburg North. Police bust the 34-year-old suspect driving the car on the spot. Kgasago said: “Investigations at the scene revealed that the crashed Ford Echo was a rented car which had been reported stolen earlier when the client failed to return it. “The arrested driver of the vehicle, together with two accomplices, were allegedly seen trying to steal another car in Boksburg but a person who witnessed the attempted theft called the police. He provided them with a description of the vehicle. “When they failed to stop when instructed to do so by police, a high speed chase followed.” Kgasago said the car was recovered and would be kept with Van Ryn Deep police in Benoni while investigations continued. “The 34-year-old bust suspect from Kwa Dukuza in KZN was held at Boksburg Police Station for possession of a stolen vehicle. “His two accomplices are still at large. “He is expected to appear in the Boksburg Magistrates Court soon,” said Kgasago.
