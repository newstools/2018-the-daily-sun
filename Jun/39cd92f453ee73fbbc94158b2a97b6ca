POLICE in Mpumalanga have arrested a man in connection with the alleged rape of two teenage girls, aged 13 and 14. The 30-year-old had been on the run since seven years ago. He was arrested after he allegedly raped his sister-in-law (24) while her husband was attending a church service on 3 June. The man from Rolle Trust outside Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, appeared in the Mhala magistrates court on Friday. He pleaded not guilty to three counts of rape. Investigating officer Detective Norah Dumisa opposed bail, saying the accused had eluded police since 2011. “DNA tests have linked him to rape cases of two teenage girls,” said Dumisa. The accused responded, saying: “I beg this court to release me on bail. I promise not to interfere with investigations or evade trial. “I am the breadwinner at home. I make money doing odd jobs. If I remain behind bars, my family will starve.” Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba postponed the bail hearing to Thursday.
