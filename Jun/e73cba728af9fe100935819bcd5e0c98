A MUM was still trying to come to terms with the death of her 18-month-old daughter when cops gave her horrific news. The 34-year-old from Mtwalume, southern KZN, told Daily Sun police revealed her daughter had been raped the day before she died on Wednesday! The mum said her daughter was living with her 26-year-old father in Esikhaleni, near Empangeni in northern KZN, at the time of her death. She said the child’s father told her the baby’s stepmother left her in the care of her uncle while she went to buy groceries on Tuesday. “My daughter had been living with them since December because I work odd hours,” she said. “The entire family was taken in for questioning and the uncle was arrested for raping her. The family had been very kind to her.” The mum said the baby’s father called her on Tuesday and said she had a swollen forehead and blood on her mouth and privates. The uncle told the family the baby had eaten fertilizer. “He told me they were going to take her to the clinic the next morning, but when they woke up she was dead.” She said she phoned the police about the incident after a local funeral parlour told her the baby had died mysteriously. Two days later, the police called the baby’s father and asked him to bring the uncle to the cop shop, where they arrested him. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed a 23-year-old suspect was arrested for murder and rape on Friday. “He will appear in court soon. It’s alleged the suspect was left with the child, and when the stepmum came home later in the day the child was unconscious. She was pronounced dead the next day,” she said.
