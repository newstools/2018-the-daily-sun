WIN or lose, it’s common knowledge that Ozzies love their
booze. So it’s no surprise that Sydney Morning Herald is reporting that Socceroo supporters out in
force for their team’s opening match of the 2018 World Cup on Saturday left many
of the beer taps of the city dry after the game. About 15 000 Australian fans flooded the city of Kazan in
central Russia with their green and gold for the match. In a thrilling
encounter, they eventually went down to the French 2 – 1. Pubs in Kazan were packed with excited Australians during
and after the game, said the report. Many venues had all of their beer taps drained to empty
by the end of the night. One of the venues reported 450 litres of beer being
consumed before closing time. Bars were forced to refill their beer stocks on
Sunday morning. Evgeny, the head
bartender of Gudini Bar in Kazan, said: "Australian guys are like
Russians, we are the same because we are drinking too much. In the morning, we
did not have any beer in the pub. All the beer was drunk. "It was so busy, it was so much fun because a lot of
Australian people came into our pub and drank all night. I don’t know exactly
how many glasses of beer I poured last night but I think it was one million.” "We were so busy yesterday, it was crazy and it was
full of Australians. We really like the Australians, they are a lot of fun and
they are always laughing and smiling," Twin Peaks pub security guard,
Marcel Kamashev, said. Happily, there were no reports of violent or foolish
drunken behaviour. More than 36 000 tickets were bought by Australians for
this year’s World Cup.
