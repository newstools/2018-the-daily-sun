ALTHOUGH he trains in a shack with no roof, Boitumelo Mootane is the king of body building in Cosmo City. The 24-year-old who has won the Patrice Molefe bodybuilding competition for the past four years said he had been working hard since he was 15. He told Daily Sun that he started with concrete gym equipment he inherited from his father, who was also a body builder. “I used to accompany my father to karate training. As I watched him, I learned how to rip muscle tissue, how to eat well and how to work out,” he said. Boitumelo is a personal trainer and general manager at A Team Gym in Cosmo City, Joburg. He said he joined the gym last year after taking part in one of its body building competitions. Gym owner Claud Maphosa offered him a job after recognising his fitness and talent. Boitumelo said before Claude hired him, he asked him where he trained. “I took him to my shack gym, which was filled with self-made concrete equipment. He was surprised that such a poor gym could produce this well-toned body.” Boitumelo said one of his primary roles at the gym was to train gogos on Tuesdays and Thursdays. A video of the gogos went viral recently and an 87-year-old participant was sponsored for a trip to Durban. Boitumelo has appeared on Generations: The Legacy as a fitness trainer. He said his dream was to upgrade his shack gym one day.
