GHANAIAN soccer structures are in tatters today after a shocking
documentary revealed evidence of massive corruption. The documentary, When
Greed and Corruption Become the Norm, was made over two years by
investigative journalist Anas Aremayaw Anas. It shows more than 100 football officials - most of them referees
from West African - receiving cash gifts. Fifa rules expressly forbid it. The documentary was publically shown for the first time
on Wednesday, and the fallout has been dramatic. The country’s president, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,
today ordered the arrest of the President of the Ghana Football Association
(GFA), Kwesi Nyantakyi. The entire GFA has also been dissolved. Nyantakyi, who is also a member of the Fifa Council, was
one of those filmed accepting money. He was shown taking $65 000 (about R852
000) “shopping money” from an undercover reporter pretending to be a rich
businessman. In a statement published by The Guardian, Information minister Mustapha Abdul-Hamid said: “Having
regard to the widespread nature of the apparent rot involving top GFA
officials, NSA [National Sports Authority] officials, match commissioners,
football administrators and referees, government has decided to take immediate steps
to have the GFA dissolved.” Nyantakyi has so far not commented on the allegations,
according to the BBC. Fifa is also yet to react. Another bust on camera taking a $600 (about R7 860) was Kenyan
referee Adel Range Marwa, who was bound for the World Cup in Russia. He has
since resigned although he denies any wrongdoing.
