South African rapper, Kiernan Forbes, better known as AKA is currently celebrating a major milestone. His latest and allegedly last album, Touch My Blood, has sold over 20 000 copies in its first week of release. In SA musical terms, 20 000 earns an artist gold status. “We wanted to keep it a surprise and wait for the plaque ... but the MEGACY is too fast and clearly we can’t hide it from you any longer ... Thank You to everyone who has bought this album ... #TouchMyBlood is now GOLD,” AKA announced. The album was released on Friday, 15 June and the announcement came exactly a week later. The rapper has been going around the country promoting the album and signing physical copies for his fans in Mzansi since the release. Since he made the gold status announcement, he has opened up about how emotional this moment is for him. He also walked around Sandton City mall yesterday handing out free copies of the CD. Check out his reaction below We went Gold today so we decided to walk through the mall and give out free cds to the people who couldn’t/haven’t bought it yet. @business_malcolm_x thank you for helping me spread LOVE ??
