RATCHET LOW – See the word Ratchet has many undertones to it, many say it’s a rude annoying person trying to act ghetto or a nasty dirty person who doesn't take care of themselves. Well the Ratchet we’re talking about here is one mean looking Volkswagen (VW) Polo Vivo. On the first episode of Car’lture’s second season, we had a chat with Lefa about his simple but elegant Polo Vivo, he calls “Ratchet Low”. Lefa says he recently gave the car its name, which is RATCHET LOW, about a month ago. “I was inspired by my friend’s brand, which is Ratchet Wear.” Many people don’t understand the obsession with one’s car looking unique on the road, but it brings "PRIDE” to the owner of the vehicle. To stand out from the crowd, Lefa bought himself a Polo Vivo nine months ago and he didn’t waste any time in executing the modifications he had planned out already. He went and installed a Webasto Hollandia 400 Ragtop Sunroof, for a good Sunday afternoon drive, on a sunny summer's day to soak in the sunlight while going for a drive. As if that wasn’t enough, he we has fixation for changing the wheels on his car. “I keep on changing the wheels, I think these are the ninth set I’ve put on my car,” Lefa said. “The car is on Castor Air Suspension and as you can see the car is riding on OEM BMW E90 rims, wrapped in 165/35 rubber,” he added.
