HER abusive former boyfriend strikes in the middle of the night! Even though Nompumelelo Mtshali has fled from the clutches of the evil man she said continues to verbally abuse her and threatens to kill her over the phone every night between 11pm and 1am. The 32-year-old now fears for her life. Nompumelelo, from Germiston in Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun the abuse started when they were staying together in Vosloorus. She said the man (42) tried to strangle her every single night. “He would get worked up over nothing,” she said. Nompumelelo said he would throttle her and threaten to kill her. “In the morning he would apologise and promise never to do it again. “He was an angel in the morning, but come midnight, he became a monster.” Nompumelelo said when he poured a liquid chemical over her in April she decided to leave him. “But he is following me everywhere. I need any form of help I can get because the police won’t even open cases for me. They always want proof, which I do not have,” she said. Captain Kay Makhubela said Nompumelelo should go back to the station and speak to the station commander about the incidents.
