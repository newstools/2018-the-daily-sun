OFFICIALS fromthe Mpumalanga education department, Exxaro Coal Mine, Seriti Resources and Eskom visited Bonginhlanhla Primary School in Kriel on Monday. The visit was part of a sod- turning ceremony for the building of a R22-million state-of-the-art school project. About 1 033 pupils at the school will benefit from the project. The school was one of many that needed a serious facelift after being declared unsafe for pupils and teachers. The first phase of the donation is R10 million for the building of 12 classrooms and toilets. The second phase will be for the building of 12 classrooms, a library, kitchen and school hall. About R12 million has been set aside for the project. The project is expected to be completed in July next year. Education MEC Sibusiso Malaza said: “Many businesses should emulate this and work together with government to take the delivery of quality education in the province forward. “We will hold each other’s hand as business and government and continue to climb the hills and walk the valleys until we conquer, for we know it is not yet uhuru. The desires of our forefathers, enshrined in the Freedom Charter, will be realised in our lifetime. “As we celebrate the centenary of Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu, let us ensure that their dream about the education of our kids will become a reality. “We have at our disposal the most powerful weapon to change the world as envisaged by Tata. Together we stand and united we will conquer.”
