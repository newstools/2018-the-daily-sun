A KENYAN all-girls’ school is in shock after a horrific attack on three of its boarders in the early hours of Sunday morning. According to the Daily Nation, unknown thugs entered the Elgon Hostel at Moi Girls’ School in Nairobi at about 2am on Sunday morning. A student told the Daily Nation: “Three men entered the cubicle shared by four girls. One girl managed to escape unhurt. The men then attempted to rape two other girls but they escaped, although they were beaten. One attacker managed to rape one of the girls.” Shocking details also emerged of how the raped teenager was left alone, bleeding and terrified on the floor of her hostel cubicle, for hours after the attack. Students claim that they attempted to raise the alarm with a matron at the hostel, but she didn’t respond until 5am to their cries for help. Detectives went on the offensive on Monday, ordering six male teachers and two other male members of staff at the school to give DNA samples to investigators. The school has been temporarily closed. This is the second tragedy to have struck the school in recent times. In September last year, nine girls died and 10 were badly injured when their dormitory was deliberately set on fire.
