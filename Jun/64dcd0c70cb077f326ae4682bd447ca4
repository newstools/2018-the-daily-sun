ALL gogo Salamina Mgidi wants is to be left in peace to praise God in her shack. The 60-year-old from Soshanguve extension H in Tshwane told Daily Sun that her neighbour has been making her life hell for more than 10 years. She claimed the trouble first started when her neighbour tried to sleep with her ex-husband. “My ex told me the woman came to our house once and asked him to sleep with her but he refused. She started calling me names,” she said. Gogo Salamina said a few years later, her man left her. “I thought because my man had left, the woman would stop harassing me but it got worse. Every time I pray, she throws stones on my roof. She always interrupts me when I talk to God.” Gogo Salamina claimed she got a protection order against the woman. But the neighbour apparently told the police that she had done nothing wrong and would never go to court. Gogo Salamina said she needed help from pastors. “Pastors preach that we should love our neighbours as we love ourselves. I don’t hate my neighbour. I just want peace,” she said. The neighbour was not at home when the SunTeam visited Gogo Salamina and therefore couldn’t get her contact number. Police spokeswoman Constable Zanele Mtsweni advised the gogo to report the matter to the court or to see the local station commander. “She needs to tell the court that the woman has gone against the protection order. They will advise her accordingly,” she said.
