Local actress Magkotso Monyemokathoe, simply known as Makgotso M, decided to try out a new Brazilian hair treatment but little did she know she was going to regret that decision. The 26 year-old took to Instagram to share her ordeal with the hair product that forced her to cut her beautiful Afro. “So I had a beautiful solid fro and I decided to get a Brazilian treatment done to my hair and my life was never the same lol. My hair fell out and I just had to cut it all! I was devastated. “Who even asked me to be doing treatments I know nothing about?” Makgotso wrote. Nonetheless, the Isidingo star still received a lot of compliments on social media for her new hair style.
