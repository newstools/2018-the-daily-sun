AMABHACA love their culture and will do anything to preserve it. The Bhaca ethnic group in Strand, Cape Town, has an After School for boys and girls. The school is called Umzila wamaBhaca. It teaches teenagers and young adults about their culture, teen pregnancy, moral values and other social problems. Girls undergo regular virginity testing. A traditional dance event was held at the school on Saturday. A video featuring virgins as old as 30 was later shot at Lwandle taxi rank. The Bhaca ethnic group is mainly found in the small towns of the former Transkei homeland near Mount Frere, Umzimkhulu and the surrounding areas. Bhaca Prince Lindile Makaula said the DVD was to be sent to the Eastern Cape. “We want to show our people that we still follow and appreciate our culture and traditions. “Western methods have failed to prevent teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.” The After School was established in 2013 and has many branches across the province. Gogo Mazulu Jekwa(75), who conducts virginity tests, told Daily Sun: “The school not only caters for the Bhaca group. We welcome all those who want to be part of our culture. “Every year we travel to KZN or the Eastern Cape to attend Umhlanga, the annual reed dance ceremony celebrating virginity that is held every year. “We share our knowledge with other elders.”
