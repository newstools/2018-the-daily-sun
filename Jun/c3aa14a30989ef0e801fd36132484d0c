THIS Joburg Metro cop thought nobody was looking when he demanded a bribe. Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the 33-year-old cop was bust on Monday. Minnaar said the cop, who was absent without leave, wore his uniform when he stopped a motorist for ignoring a red traffic light in Turf Road in Turffontein, Joburg. The cop allegedly asked for a R3 000 bribe. Joburg Metro internal affairs officers stopped to offer help but became suspicious when the cop started driving the motoristâ€™s vehicle and his friend drove a VW Caddy. The officers quickly arrested the cop, who has been charged with trying to ask for a bribe and illegally enforcing the law. Minnaar said the cop was being held at Moffatview Police Station and would face disciplinary action. He has also been linked to robberies, hijackings and blackmail.
