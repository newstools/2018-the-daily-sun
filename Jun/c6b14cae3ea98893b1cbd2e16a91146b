LAST year gogo Junior Mlomo’s loved ones threw a big birthday party for her. At the time the gogo (110) could still see, hear, walk and talk without any help. But two weeks ago the gogo from Vaalbank, Mpumalanga, said she needed to have a nap because her body was aching. When her relatives went to check on her a bit later, she was dead. Granddaughter Maria Mlomo (44) said her gogo’s death caught them off guard. “She was still strong. She even helped us look after our kids,” said Maria. She said despite not having gone to school her gogo was clever and was a hard worker. “She worked as a domestic worker for many years and was very wise. “You could not manipulate or deceive her. “We have learnt a lot from her teachings,” she said. The gogo was buried on Saturday at Vaalbank Cemetery. “Ordinary residents and members of political parties went to the service to bid farewell to the kasi’s oldest resident. Resident July Mithileni (53) said he could not believe what he was hearing when he was told the gogo had died. He said he asked people to donate money for the gogo’s burial. “I would like to thank the ANC members who made donations,” said July. “They gave us a blanket to cover the coffin, T-shirts for the family and a cow.” He encouraged young people to take a leaf out of the gogo’s book. “The youth should concentrate on their education so they can become future leaders. “Let us learn from how gogo lived her life.” The gogo attributed her good health to being respectful, exercising, having a balanced diet and staying away from drugs. The gogo is survived by six children, 44 grandchildren, 52 great-grandchildren and 34 great-great-grandchildren.
