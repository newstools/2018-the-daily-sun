A quick thinking driver managed to get away from armed hijackers. A video of an attempted hijacking in Langlaagte, Joburg, has surfaced on social media. The incident reportedly occurred just behind the testing station,
towards Mayfair. In the video, a white Mercedes Benz is seen overtaking
another silver looking Mercedes Benz and making a sudden stop in front of it. As soon as it stops, three armed men are seen getting out
of the white Benz approaching the silver Benz. But the quick thinking driver of the silver Benz could be
seen making a u-turn and getting away. It appears as if he was being followed.
