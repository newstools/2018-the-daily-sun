TWO people were killed and six others injured when
a taxi rolled down a mountain on the R712 in the Golden Gate Reserve, between
QwaQwa and Clarens, Free State. ER24's Russel Meiring said when paramedics arrived
on the scene they found a taxi lying on its side some distance down the side of
a mountain. He added that the passengers were found lying spread
around the taxi. "Paramedics assessed the patients and found
that two had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life.
Unfortunately, nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead by
Provincial Services," Meiring said. According to Meiring six other patients were
attended and showed that the injuries sustained ranged from moderate to
serious. The patients were treated for their injuries and
were thereafter transported to nearby hospitals for further treatment. The details surrounding this incident are not yet
known.
