SIX pastors have decided to fight nyaope with prayer. The men of God from Soshanguve, Tshwane gathered at Mabopane Train Station on Tuesday afternoon to pray as part of International Day Against Drug Abuse. Apostle Joe Manamela said they were tired of seeing young people being killed by drugs. “We are not here to judge addicts. We actually encouraged them to pray with us and to seek divine intervention to kick the habit,” he said. Pastor Letta Malala said they were disturbed by research from the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University that addicts who injected themselves using the Bluetooth method were very likely to be HIV-positive. “Enough is enough. As parents, we can’t watch our kids die,” said the pastor said. The addicts said they were happy the pastors prayed for them and they were ready to change. Nyaope addict Lindiwe Mnisi (24) said she hoped she could kick the habit. “The pastors are right. This nyaope is an evil spirit and I feel like a slave to the drug. After they prayed for me, I felt dirty and I could see how I had ruined my life,” she said.
