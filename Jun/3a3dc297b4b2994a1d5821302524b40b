POLICE are investigating the killing of Khanyisile Gasa (29) and the attempted murder of her 34-year-old friend. Khanyisile and her friend were cornered by an angry mob in G section of Ethekwini on Monday after they were accused of being scammers. It is alleged the two promised people jobs in exchange for cash. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “Both women were taken to hospital after being assaulted. The 29-year-old later succumbed to her injuries. Charges of murder and attempted murder were opened.” A resident of Chesterville, west of Durban, said she met Khanyisile at church in August. She said Khanyisile promised to get her a job as a security guard if she paid R4 000. “She told me I would be employed at the beginning of December, but that did not happen,” claimed the resident. “She started ignoring my calls and SMSes and blocked me on WhatsApp. I was hoping to bump into her at church, but the other congregants said she had moved to a new one.” She said she was later sent a video of residents confronting Khanyisile. In the video, residents can be heard asking where their money is and why she is wearing a shirt with the municipality’s logo on it.
