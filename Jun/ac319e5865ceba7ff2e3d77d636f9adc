LIFE is tough for this madala. He hasn’t received his pension for two months. Madala John Mfeka (70) from K section KwaMashu, north of Durban told Daily Sun that he last received his grant in March. He said when he didn’t get it in April he went to the Sassa offices in Bridge City to enquire. “Officials told me their system showed that I wasn’t married. They asked me to bring my marriage certificate. I submitted the certificate and the problem was fixed and I got a new card. In May, I went to withdraw money and the card was swallowed by the ATM,” he said. He said he had to go to the Sassa office again. “This time they told me I had to reapply for my grant. They said in fact the reapplication was supposed to be done in 2014. But I didn’t get a letter informing me of that. I haven’t received my pension since I reapplied. I haven’t been told how long it will take for my reapplication to be approved,” he said. He said the office was always full and sometimes he went back home without being helped. “I want the KZN Department of Social Development to intervene in this matter. I’m suffering.” KZN Social Development spokesman Vukani Mbhele said the madala will have to go back to the Sassa office. KZN Sassa spokesman Mbizeni Mdlalose said: “The beneficiary was supposed to do a pin rest in order to access his grant. He must have entered the wrong pin. He must go to the Durban Station office and organise a new card. We will make sure he is assisted.”
