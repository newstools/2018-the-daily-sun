The cops in Modimolle are looking for a man suspected to be involved in a spate of serious crimes at different businesses. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe
Ngoepe said the manhunt follows an incident where an unknown man entered the
local shopping mall pretending to be an inspector from the Labour Department. He then informed the Mall Manager that he
needed to inspect the businesses inside but later he disappeared. Ngoepe said this suspect further went to
one of the car washes in the area ,introduced himself again as an Inspector and
asked a 50-year-old man who is the manager to see his phone as it had cracks on
the screen. He said the preliminary Police
investigations have revealed that after conducting his inspection at the car
wash, the impostor then disappeared with the victim's phone. "We believe that this suspect might
have committed a number of crimes using the same modus operandi in and around
the area or beyond but the Police investigations will tell as they are still
unfolding," said Ngoepe. The South African Police Service are calling
upon the man pictured below to come to Modimolle Police Station or the nearest
