RESIDENTS of Mesiya squatter camp in Philippi, Cape Town, were over the moon when businessman Tony Soares gave them smoke detectors on Wednesday. Soares, the manager of Green Planet Laundry, was keeping a promise he made when he donated money for DNA tests to the Tyhalani family, which lost five kids in a shack fire two weeks ago. He said his business wanted to be about much more than just washing dirty clothes. “We consider it our duty to reach out and lend a helping hand to communities in need. Our latest initiative is one where we aim to equip every informal home with a smoke detector,” he said. Soares said he bought 25 smoke detectors but would be donating more in the future. “I am going to ask other businesses and private individuals to donate towards this cause.” Soares said he would call the initiative the #SaveTheChildren campaign. “Imagine how many lives could be saved if every shack in Cape Town had a smoke detector.” Councillor Siphiwo Nqamnduku said even though he did not know how the smoke detectors worked, he was happy fewer lives would be lost to shack fires. Lindiwe Falteni, the mother of one of the victims, said they would forever be grateful to Soares. “If someone had come up with this idea earlier, maybe our kids would still be alive,” she said. Pumza Ngwenduna (22), who got a smoke detector, was happy. She said: “We hope it comes in handy.”
