A SEX worker is in court for allegedly planning to sell her 10-year-old granddaughter for sex. According to The New Zealand Herald, the unnamed gogo appeared with co-accused Andrew Davie in the Wellington District Court last Friday. The gogo and Davie have pleaded guilty to entering into a deal to sexually exploit a child, although both say they had no intention of actually following through with their plan. Davie, who was known to the magosha as a client, was bust by cops while sexually grooming another 14-year-old girl. Cops started paying him attention in May 2017 when he was reported for approaching the teenager at a library. He claimed he was a talent scout and wanted to take photos of her in underwear for a modelling agency. It was when he met the teenager for the third time that cops intervened. They discovered a collection of text messages between him and the magosha on his cellphone where they discussed their plans for Davie to have sex with the woman’s granddaughter. Davie offered her $1 000 (about R8 800), but the magoshas replied she wanted a cheap, reliable car as payment for sex with her granddaughter. Cops also discovered photos on Davie’s phone of the 10-year-old naked in the bath. Davie bought the grandmother cellphone data so she could send him the photos. Texts written by Davie also detailed sexual things he wanted to do with kids ages 8 to sixteen, but Davie claimed he was just describing fantasies that he would never carry out. The hearing was adjourned as Judge Jan Kelly made up her mind whether the evidence pointed to an offence, or were just sexual fantasies.
