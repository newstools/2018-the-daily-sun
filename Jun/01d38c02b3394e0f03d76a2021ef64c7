GOGO Sarah Chakwane’s house was admired by everyone who walked past it. Last month, the 67-year-old renovated her house to make it even more attractive. But on Tuesday the gogo almost died of shock when everything she worked for went up in smoke! The eight-roomed house in Phomolong section of Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, was burnt by a mysterious fire. The gogo suspects it was vutha. “Whoever is behind this will never see heaven,” said the gogo. “This is the only thing I could call my own and now it is destroyed. “Now I am homeless with no clothes and food. How can such a thing happen to me? “My late husband and I worked on this house until 1998.” Sarah said she was walking her daughter to a taxi not far from the house when she heard her neighbours screaming. When she approached her house she was greeted by the sight of smoke and fire. “The community tried their best to put out the flames but it was too late.” Sarah said all eight rooms caught fire, causing the roof to collapse. She said she would need help to rebuild her house. “I don’t know how I’m going to do that. “I can use all the help I can get, from building materials to clothes and blankets.” Dungamanzi Mtsibini, a traditional healer from Wattville in Ekurhuleni, advised the family to seek help. “Their ancestors saved them as no one was inside the house when the incident happened. “They are lucky to be alive. “It is obvious that jealous people are behind this . They are the only ones who can send the fire to the family’s home. “The family must seek help from a sangoma or traditional healer.”
