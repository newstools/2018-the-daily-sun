Rachel Kolisi, who is married to newly appointed Springbok captain, Siya Kolisi has a message for everyone who has eyes for her man. Simply put, leave her man alone, respect her relationship and respect her as a woman! That was her fierce response to a woman who went onto Twitter and called Siya her “type”. “He’s not “a type”. He’s a married man responsible for 4 children,” Rachel responded. As if that wasn’t enough, she turned the response into a mini thread to warn people off of coming for her man and their relationship. “I watched a local TV show last week where a local “celeb” was encouraging her friend to “go after/date/hook up” with Siya Kolisi. Had to rewind a few times to make sure I heard right,” she continued. Clearly Rachel is upset at the notion of her husband being attractive to other women and that those women can have the guts to publicly declare their feelings for him because her little rant did not end there. “Just a side note. I’ve been there for all the good times. But I’ve also been there for ALL the bad times. Honestly this should go without saying. Respect my relationship and woman to woman. Respect me,” she ended the rant.
