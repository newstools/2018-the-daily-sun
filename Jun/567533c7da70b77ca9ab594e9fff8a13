THE Public Servants Association (PSA) members at the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) are expected  to go on strike on Monday. PSA says the strike is based on the employers’ failure to offer their employees a reasonable salary. "The PSA declared a dispute in the Public Service Coordinating Bargaining Council (PSCBC), based on the realisation that the employer was negotiating in bad faith and prolonging the negotiation process unduly," PSA's General Manager, Ivan Fredricks said. According to Fredricks, the wage dispute was also referred for arbitration in the PSCBC on behalf of essential services employees who cannot embark on strike action. The Public Service Co-Ordinating Bargaining Council wage agreement by the majority of public service unions last week, increasing workers' salaries by between 6% and 7%. PSA spokesperson Tahir Maepa public servants became increasingly frustrated about the delayed process. The PSA says it was excluded from the finalisation of the agreement, whilst they were having bi-laterals talks with the employer and tabled the finalised draft agreement in Council on 21 May 2018.  .
