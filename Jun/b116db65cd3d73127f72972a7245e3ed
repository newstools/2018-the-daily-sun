MYSTERY surrounds the brutal death of a man allegedly mauled by lions. The man was apparently found dead in the lions’ den, which is secured with a high fence, at a resort near Parys. When the victim’s remains were discovered, his body parts were scatted all over the den but the big cats lions had not eaten their victim. Thapelo Mosedi (47), one of the people at the gruesome scene, said: “What happened to that man is sad as pieces of his flesh were scatted all over that den.” He said what he doesn’t understand is how the victim managed to climb into the lions’ den as the fence is about 2,5 metres high. Police spokeswoman Josephine Rani said it was a mystery. The unknown man had the name Tumelo tattooed on his left arm. Rani said one of the employees on the farm was patrolling when he realised there was a dead man in the enclosure. “Police believe that the victim may be 21 or so in age and was wearing a light blue, long sleeved shirt and denim shorts. “Anyone who has a missing relative or who knows anyone who matches the description should contact Captain Gert Bruwer on 082 466 8094.
