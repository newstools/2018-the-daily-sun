THE Polokwane Magistrate's Court has sentenced Gibbs Makwana (19)
to 10 years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend. The incident occurred in June 2017 at about 09:00 in Tafelkop, Stadium View
section. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the police were tipped off by
shepherd, after he discovered the body of a young girl. He said the body was hacked with a sharp object and was still
dressed in a school uniform. “The deceased was later identified as Dimakatso Tlaka, aged 15 years from
Tafelkop who was a Grade 10 learner at Boleu High School,” Ngoepe said. According to Ngoepe, a manhunt for the suspect ensued and Makwana, who is the
boyfriend of the deceased and was then arrested later that same day. Makwana was a Grade 9  learner at the same school “The accused was also declared unfit to possess a firearm in terms of Section
103 of Act 60 of 2000(Firearm Control Act),” Ngoepe said. The Acting Povincial Commissioner General Jan Scheepers applauded the
dedication of Motetema Detectives who ensured that justice prevailed.  He said this should serve as a deterrent to those who commit
crime while under age, that the long arm of the law will eventually catch up with
them.
