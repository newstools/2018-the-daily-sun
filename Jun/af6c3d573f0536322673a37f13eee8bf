YESTERDAY, DA Limpopo MP Langa Bodlani paid WF Knobel Hospital in Moletjie a visit to inspect the premises. A letter written by a senior hospital doctor asking for donations to buy heaters for sick patients because of the cold affecting patients in paediatric wards had made the rounds on social media. The doctor’s letter shocked people around the province. He wrote: “It is winter and it is terribly cold, especially at night and early morning. Our loved ones, sick patients and the poorest of the poor are admitted to wards with broken windows, with the cold stopping their recovery.” “As we lack resources, our patients sleep with one or two blankets and our wards are really cold. “In the name of ubuntu, I humbly request your financial assistance to raise R15 000 so we can buy 50 heaters for our female and male paediatric wards.” The visit comes after the health department told off the doctor for asking for donations using its letterheads and stamps, saying he should have used the department’s channels. Bodlani said the situation is scary because the doors don’t close properly and expose patients to the cold weather. “The children’s wards have no hot water and nothing to warm water. The doors are broken and some taps aren’t even working. “The situation is unbearable because there also is a shortage of blankets. The department must take responsibility and fix this. “There is a shortage of cleaners and no ward attendants,” he said. Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba said the department is committed to renewing all ageing facilities as part of dealing with infrastructural challenges at health care facilities. “We should ensure health professionals have the capacity to manage and lead in the public service.”
