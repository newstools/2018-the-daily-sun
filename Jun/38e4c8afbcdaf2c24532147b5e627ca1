South
African rapper Nasty C is set to release his Sophomore album, Strings And
Bling on 6 July 2018.  Today, fans are able to pre-order the album
Strings
And Bling and receive the instant grat track, “Legendary,” where
Nasty C addresses themes like self-confidence and the pursuit of equal
opportunity. Described
as his most personal album to date, Strings And Bling finds Nasty
C rapping about his real life over production by the likes of American
producers, Blu Magiq and Cxdy as well as Africa’s own Gemini Major, Tweezy ,
Gobbla, and up-and-coming trailblazer, Nani.  Guest appearances include
A$AP Ferg, Rowlene and Kaien Cruz. Strings
And Bling is a
layered presentation that deals with what’s on the surface and what lies
beneath. Having already dropped monster singles such as ‘King’ and ‘Jungle’,
Nasty C carves a new lane away from the rap of today’s radio. Instead, he
cruises onto a lush, string-led post-trap road. Recently
the Durban-raised lyricist performed at London’s Wembley Arena for the One
Africa Music Festival and was announced as one of four of South Africa’s
favourite artists who made it into the coveted Forbes Africa Under 30 list.
Nasty C also took home the Coolest Local Music Star award at
this year’s Sunday Time’s annual Generation Next Brand Awards.
