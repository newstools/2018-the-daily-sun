POLICE Minister Bheki Cele plans to put an end to serious
and violent crimes. Cele Â briefed the
media on Monday, he said the violent crimes have instilled fear in innocent
people's lives. He said last week, a nine-year-old girl was shot and killed
after the vehicle she was travelling in was hijacked. "I have directed the SAPS top management to adopt an
extraordinary operational approach to stabilise this crime wave, which must be
followed by a normalisation approach. Therefore, in our efforts to stamping the authority of the
State, we will be introducing the execution of a high-density stabilisation
intervention going forward," Cele said. Cele mentioned that their intention is to combat crimes
including cash-in-transit heists, car hi-jacking, murders, house robberies,
gang violence and related crimes, taxi violence. He emphasised that moving forward, they will ensure high
density visibility of uniformed police officers on foot and vehicles, supported
by the SAPS air wing, continuous cordon and search operations, continuous
roadblocks and relentless search for wanted suspects.
