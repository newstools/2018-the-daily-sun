Singer and songwriter Kelly Khumalo says she is ready to get back into the dating game, but this time, things will be very different. Kelly has, to say the least, been quite unlucky when it comes to romance with none of her previous public relationships ending well. Even in her music, one can hear how unkind the dating scene has been to her. But the singer says she has realized what her biggest mistake has been and she is ready to switch things up. Speaking to her bestie, Thami Dish on Touch HD recently, Kelly revealed that she never dated men because she wanted or liked them, but only because they wanted her. "I’ve always gone into relationships because someone has asked me out, it has never been about, do I [want to] be with this person, do I want to date this person, do I want a relationship with this person? Do I even like this person enough to be in a relationship with them? So it has always been about the other party as opposed to me,” she revealed. She went on to say that she is now wiser and ready to make smarter choices with her heart. “…it’s not about who wants me, it's about who I want, which has changed the whole love, relationship and dating game. I will not let you into my space unless I want to, I will not keep you unless I see something worth keeping,” she said. She then went on to describe the kind of person she wants to have in her life. “I’m not looking for a young boy, I’m looking for a man, who will be able to stand up to this woman that I’ve become; a woman who knows what she wants and what she represents. And for you to be part of this, you need to know what you want and what you represent as an individual,” she continued.
