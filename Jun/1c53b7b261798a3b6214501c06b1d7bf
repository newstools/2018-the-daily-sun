Kaizer Chiefs have added goalkeeper Virgil Vries to the list of new signings for the upcoming 2018/2019 season. The Namibian arrives on a three-year contract after spending a season with Baroka FC. The 29-year-old also previously played for Golden Arrows and Maritzburg United. With the departure of Brilliant Khuzwayo to Orlando Pirates, it appears the Glamour Boys are seeking a 'keeper who has had more first team action in the Absa Premiership to come in as cover. Currently, Chiefs have the youthful pair of Bruce Bvuma and Brylon Petersen in the goalkeeping department, though Motaung says that they needed a keeper who has experience. “After Brilliant Khuzwayo left, we wanted to get a seasoned goalkeeper to assist Itumeleng Khune,” the club’s Football Manager Bobby Motaung announced. “We have a few talented youngsters like Bruce Bvuma and Brylon Petersen who need to work with experienced keepers. We welcome Virgil.” SOURCE: SPORT24
