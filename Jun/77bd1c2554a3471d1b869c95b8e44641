FORMER president Jacob Zuma's corruption case has been postponed
to 27 July. Zuma appeared briefly in the Durban High Court on Friday
morning. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and the Zuma's lawyer asked for the postponement of the case. The NPA said it wants to study the arms company Thales'
representations to withdraw the case. Zumaâ€™s legal counsel asked for more time to finalise issues around
his legal costs. Zuma faces 12 counts of fraud, one money laundering, one
count of racketeering and two counts of corruption. Zuma is accused of taking bribes from French arms maker
Thales over a contract worth R30 billion. His co-accused is a representative from French arms dealer
Thales, Christine Guerrier.
