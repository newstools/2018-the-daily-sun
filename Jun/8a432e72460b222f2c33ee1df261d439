MPUMALANGA Education MEC Sibusiso Malaza is shocked because a fourth school was burned on Tuesday night. The fire destroyed three classrooms at Ditau Secondary School in Shatale, near Bushbuckridge. According to sources, the school was burned over issues relating to the firing of a number of principals. Malaza said: “The school is the fourth one to be burnt in the past five days. “This is something the department condemns in the strongest possible terms. “What concerns the department is that Ditau is an underperforming school and this affects efforts to improve pupil performance. “Out of 551 high schools in the province, Ditau is ranked 525.” Malaza said since 2013, the maths pass rate at the school had dropped from 54,4% to 45% “This development means that the 407 pupils at this school will not write exams that were due to take place this week. “Lessons have been suspended,” said Malaza. “The department doesn’t have the financial resources to fix the damage caused by some unruly communities.” Reckson Silinda, chief fire officer at Bushbuckridge Municipality, said: “The admin block and three classrooms were destroyed before firefighters killed the blaze.” Captain Donald Mabasa said cops were investigating a case of arson. “Anyone with information that may lead to the arrest of the suspects should contact Brigadier Zachariah Nyathi on 082 453 8305 or 013 799 5519.”
