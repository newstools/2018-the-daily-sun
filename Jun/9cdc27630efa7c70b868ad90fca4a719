RESIDENTS of Etafuleni in Inanda, north of Durban, were in the past moved into RDP houses that had mobile toilets. But they’re now complaining that in the past three years, eThekwini Municipality has, taken the toilets away five times, only to return them a few weeks later. Resident Nonhlanhla Goba (48) told Daily Sun: “The last time they took the toilets away was in April, for two weeks. “We asked the councillor why this had happened, but all he said was that he’d come back to us.” Nomagugu Hlongwane (52) said being forced to kak in the bushes, while boys were walking past, was embarrassing for a self-respecting woman such as herself. “The other day I had no choice. I had a runny tummy,” she said. “Of course I was embarrassed when a group of nosy boys walked past. Councillor Musa Nyaba said it was companies with tenders to supply toilets who were at fault, not the municipality. “Those companies take their toilets away if the municipality does not pay them!” Spokesman Mandla Nsele admitted, however, it was the municipality’s job to supply mobile toilets. When the SunTeam asked him more questions, Nsele asked that they be emailed to him. The questions were sent last Thursday, but he had not responded by yesterday.
