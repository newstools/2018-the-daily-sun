A campaign called the #Kinging Celebration recently saw Mzansi’s most creative men being honoured at an exclusive dinner at the Turbine Hall in Newtown, downtown Johannesburg. A collaborative effort between local fast-food giant, Steers and 5FM’s The Roger Goode Show, #Kinging recognizes and creates awareness of Mzansi creatives who “are at the forefront of pop culture curation in the fields of dance, fashion, art, food design and music”.  The Kings of the night were renowned dancer and choreographer, Lee-Che Janecke; infinite canvas sketcher and visual developer, Terence Maluleke; avant-garde fashion designer from “Nao Serati”, Neo Serati who features alongside the creative director of high-end street wear brand Uniqueiconz, Sanza -Talent Mhlongo; as well as the online sensation from “Cooking with Luyanda”, Chef Luyanda who, although is female, has been identified as a King in the kitchen.  The festivities were hosted by MTV VJ, Sandile Ntshingila. Each chosen creative was asked to show off their creative genius by putting together a showcase of their own unique interpretation of how they are ‘kinging'.  According to the organizers, each ‘culture shifter’ was celebrated because of their “authentic flair, and creativity, as they uniquely contribute to the evolution of the ‘status-quo’ within youth culture using their passion points”. The dinner also coincided with the launch of Steers’ new proudly local, Boerewors King Steer Burger, a 100% pure boerewors burger made with fresh and authentic ingredients that was served to guests at the dinner.  “We are so excited to host this extravagant dinner celebration of our real flavor that will be portrayed through the illustrations of music, dance, fashion, art and of course FOOD,” said Adolf Fourie, Steers Marketing Executive. Hip-Hop king, Anatii gave a stellar surprise performance for all the guests, media and creative leaders in attendance.
