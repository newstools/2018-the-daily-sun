HE WAS desperate for a beer but he had no money – so he came up with a dumb plan. The man was seen walking around the streets of Heidelberg, Gauteng on Friday, trying to sell his shotgun. And he was prepared to sell it for R30! But it soon got him bust. Residents became suspicious and called the cops. They said the man told them he needed a beer badly. The cops found him in possession of the gun and he was arrested. Captain Thivhulawi Tshilate of Heidelberg Police Station said the 41-year-old man was arrested for possession of an unlicensed firearm. “Cops received a tip-off from a resident about a man selling a firearm for a very small amount of money. Police responded, which led to the recovery of a bronze barrel shotgun with a brown wooden butt.” The suspect and his friend were going around in a Mercedes sedan. The suspect had wrapped the gun in a blue overcoat and kept showing it to potential buyers,” said Tshilate. When cops checked the gun, the serial number had been removed. The year of manufacture, 1887, was displayed on it. Police arrested the suspect and detained him at Heidelberg police holding cells. The suspect will appear in the Heidelberg Magistrates Court soon to face a charge of possession of an unlicensed firearm.
