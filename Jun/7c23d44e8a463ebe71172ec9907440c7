Dear MizzB I am 22 and am friends with benefits with the boyfriend of my best friend. I recently found out he paid lobola for her. I feel betrayed because I thought he had feelings for me and would leave her for me. I am about to lose this man and my friend. What must I do? Dear Anonymous Your idea of friendship is toxic! Friends with benefits means you are in each other’s lives for sexual needs only. You gave this man the power to use your body, hoping you would win him over now and that it’s failed, you feel lost and confused. A man who really wants to be in your life doesn’t need sexual favours. Use this time to look at your feelings and understand you are valuable – but only in the right hands.
