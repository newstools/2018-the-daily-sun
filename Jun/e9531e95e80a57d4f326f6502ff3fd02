IF the queues at papgeld courts are anything to go by, Mzansi men have no desire to look after their children. But that is not the case with Charles Masekwameng (37). The father of three said he does not shy away from his responsibilities, which is why he is determined to register his kids’ births. Charles’ kids Dolly (15), Dimakatso (13) and Thabiso (11) have been living with his mum Caroline Masekwameng (54) at her home in Ga-Sekgopo outside Modjadjiskloof, Limpopo, since 2005. He said he last saw the kid’s mum in Tshwane around 2006 and has lost contact with her. Charles said life is hard for his kids because they don’t have birth certificates. “Their mum failed to register their births. She also didn’t have a birth certificate or ID book,” said Charles. “My kids are suffering at school because of this. “Dolly is in grade 8, but things will get worse if she gets to matric without an ID.” Caroline said she had consulted social workers and gone to Home Affairs offices to report the matter. “I’ve lost hope in Home Affairs,” she said. “My grandkids should be getting child grants because there is no money at home. “We get by on our relatives’ generosity.” Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said it was possible for Charles to register the kids’ births. However, DNA tests will need to be conducted to prove he is the children’s father. “The matter has been referred to the provincial manager who has delegated officials to contact the family,” said Mokgola. Charles, who is currently unemployed, said he can’t afford to pay for DNA tests. “About R6000 is needed for the tests. I don’t know what I’m going to do. “My kids’ future is in danger. I need help.” He appealed to SunReaders to help him raise money for the tests.
