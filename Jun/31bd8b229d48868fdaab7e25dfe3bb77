A 25-year-old Uber driver was injured on the head and face
after he was attacked on the Old Main Road in Canelands in KwaZulu Natal. The victim was allegedly attacked by three armed men after
he stopped near a bush to relieve himself. “He was robbed of his mobile phone and an undisclosed amount
of cash,” Reaction Unit South Africa  spokesperson Prem Balram. Balram  said  the Uber driver was returning from the King
Shaka International Airport after dropping off a client and used the back road. “He informed Reaction officers that he had been suffering from
diarrhea and urgently needed to use the toilet. He then took a shortcut home but stopped alongside a dense
bush when he was attacked,” Balram added. According to Balram, the victim could not confirm what
weapon was used to attack him. “He drove off towards the Canelands Library and lost consciousness
alongside the road after bleeding excessively.” Paramedics believe that the man was attacked with a panga. Balram said RUSA has attended to eight attacks on the Old
Main Road, between Tongaat and Verulam since January 2018. “In most cases the victims had stopped to relieve themselves
or engage in sexual activities in the bushy area along the roadside.”
