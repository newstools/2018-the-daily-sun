MARGARET Sithole (40) and Jabulane Masilela of Mountain View in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, were once perfect neighbours. Jabulane apparently dated Margaret’s work colleague and trusted her. And when the lover was in need of money, they’d both come up with a plan. But all that cosy neighbourliness is a thing of the past and they no longer see eye to eye . . . The girlfriend has vanished and Margaret’s house is empty! Jabulane took out a loan, supposedly for the lover and on Margaret’s advice. But she said all she did was recommend a mashonisa when her neighbour needed money to help out his lover. “In August last year I received a letter of demand from the Small Claims Court,” she said. “I went there and found out Jabulane had opened a case against me, saying I owed him R1 800 because he’d paid off my loan shack debt. “He told the court it was me who made him borrow the money, and that I said I’d pay it back.” Her furniture was taken away by the court sheriff, as a result. But he told Daily Sun it was Margaret who came up with the mashonisa idea, persuaded him to take out the loan shark, and promised to repay it. “I trusted her. But when time came to pay up, Margaret refused to pay, so I had to go to court.” He said the woman was not his lover and never intended for her furniture to be sold by a sheriff. “She didn’t respect the summons,” he said. Margaret said: “I treated him like a brother and cooked and washed his clothes. And this is how he repays me?”
