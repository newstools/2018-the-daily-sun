FOR the next 10 years, residents of iLembe Municipality on the KZN North Coast won’t have to worry about their taps running dry. This was according to Umgeni and water department officials after their visit to the Lower Thukela Bulk Water Scheme on Wednesday. The project was launched in 2016 by the former water minister Nomvula Mokonyane. When new minister Gugile Nkwinti delivered his budget speech in February, he promised to make sure that all the department’s projects were up and running. His department, in partnership with Umgeni Water, has started visiting projects in the province. The aim is to check if the plants are working effectively and whether maintenance is being done regularly. Thukela plant’s controller, Nhlanhla Gumede, said the plant produces about 55 megalitres per day, which is supplied to iLembe Municipality. “My job is to make sure that we supply quality water to the residents,” he said. Umgeni Water area manager, Pravesh Boodhoo, said the reason the plant is located in Mandeni is to ensure that there is water throughout the year.
