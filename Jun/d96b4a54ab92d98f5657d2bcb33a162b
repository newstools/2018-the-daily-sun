IT’S BEEN almost two years since Victor Mlotshwa faced death when he was forced into a coffin alive. His attackers were convicted but he never found peace – until now. A TRADITIONAL CLEANSING HAS PUT VICTOR ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY. “I feel as if a weight has been lifted off my shoulders,” said Victor, the man who was seen in a video being forced into a coffin in August 2016. Victor Mlotshwa (30) underwent a cleansing ceremony on Saturday and he is now ready to carry on with his life. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mlotshwa (30) from Middelburg in Mpumalanga said the experience was painful and he felt the bad luck needed to be removed from his life. Theo Jackson was sentenced to 14 years in prison and Willem Oosthuizen to 11 years by the Middelburg High Court. The men were convicted of assaulting Victor and shoving him into a coffin, threatening to pour petrol over him and set him alight. A video of the incident went viral over social media. Victor said the ANC had helped him a lot since the attack. He said it had made the ceremony possible. “This is a blessing and I appreciate what they have done for me and my family.” ANC regional chairman Speedy Mashilo said they felt there was a need to restore Mlotshwa’s dignity by organising the ceremony and handing a house to the family. “We believe we needed to do things the cultural way so that he can feel renewed as a person, and that is why we are also in the process of helping him get a decent job,” said Mashilo. His mum, Lonea Mlotshwa (54) said she was grateful for what they had done for her family.
