WHEN Daily Sun published a story in November about Thembela Lethole’s birth certificate problem, he was certain the matter would be resolved. But the 27-year-old father of three from Maumong outside Rustenburg, North West, said he was still waiting for his birth certificate. He said although Home Affairs officials interviewed him in December, nothing had been done since then. Before he came to the People’s Paper, he had been struggling for over 10 years to get a birth certificate. “When I asked them what the next step would be, the officials said they would let me know.” Thembela said he was struggling to support his children. He said a birth certificate was the only thing he needed to help him provide for his family. “Without my birth certificate, I can’t get an ID so I can apply for a job or further my studies. Home Affairs is not helping me. “They won’t even tell me what to expect or how long I should wait for an answer.” Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the application process included individual interviews. Mokgola said applicants who were interviewed have to wait for the outcome of the investigation.
