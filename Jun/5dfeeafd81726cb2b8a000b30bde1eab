WESTERN Cape Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo has urged women to take a stand against taxi violence. “While the relevant government departments and other partners are negotiating, as women we can’t fold our arms and only participate on mattress sitting, mourning and crying “It’s our husbands, sons, brothers and colleagues who are killing each other,” said Mbombo, who is also the leader of the Democratic Alliance Women’s Network. Taxi violence in the province claimed the lives of nine drivers in Nyanga, Gugulethu, Philippi and Wynberg at the weekend. “While men kill each other over transport routes, a widow or an orphan is born,” she said. “The face of this violence is a woman. She bears the brunt of consequences, but she is not even in the battlefield.” Mbombo said all women’s organisations and churches must take a stand to end the violence. “I am calling all women from different parties, religious groups, civil societies and NGOs to come together and talk to taxi associations and pray at taxi ranks. “We refuse to politicise this violence.” Police spokeswoman Noloyiso Rwexana said cops were working hard to deal with the recent taxi violence. “Emergency meetings with partners in the transport sector, the City of Cape Town, traffic services and cops are underway to determine the source of these violent incidents.”
