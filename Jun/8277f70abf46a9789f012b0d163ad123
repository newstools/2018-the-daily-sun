FOUR cops from the National Heliport Air Wing were awarded for their heroic acts of bravery. Brigadier Simon Mahlangu congratulated the cops and awarded them certificates and medals at the Police Academy in Pretoria West, Tshwane, on Friday. Two of the cops were recognised for efforts they made when rescuing three men trapped in a mountain. The cops were on a routine crime prevention flight to Mamelodi and Ekangala when they noticed the trapped men. The men are said to have waved at the helicopter and the cops landed to save them. The men told the cops they had been praying on the mountain when one of them fell into the ditch. The other two cops were honoured for assisting in the arrest of suspects who robbed a cash depot in Marble Hall, Limpopo, after receiving a tip-off from the Hawks. A chase ensued in Mamelodi and the suspects were finally cornered in extension 17. Mahlangu said the event was to honour dedicated, outstanding cops. He said the cops served with distinction. “You need to have fun, enjoy your work and focus on residents,” he said. “If you do all that you will excel in what you do. “These officers understand they’re here to serve.” Mahlangu said the cops also understood the importance of teamwork.
