HE turns 90 in August, but he definitely doesn’t want to be called madala! IFP leader Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi made this very clear at the land summit of traditional leaders in Durban on Wednesday. Programme director Inkosi Moshe Mabe had referred to Buthelezi as an old man. Mabe, who also is North West chairman of the House of Traditional Leaders, was introducing Co-operative Governance Minister Zweli Mkhize. Before he called the minister to the podium, he said: “Mkhize, things are bad here. You see even madalas are here looking in Buthelezi’s direction.” An angry Buthelezi said: “Look here! I may be older than your father, but you can’t call me a madala. You can’t make me a joke here.” A disappointed Mabe said he wasn’t making a joke but speaking on a lighter note. But Buthelezi kept complaining. Mabe sat quietly and the programme was taken over by Inkosi Thabisile Zulu. Inkosi Xolile Ndevu from the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders told Daily Sun they were all embarrassed by the incident. They understood Mabe didn’t mean to offend. Among the amakhosi who attended were Mwelo Nonkonyane, Deputy Labour Minister Phathekile Holomisa from Eastern Cape, National House of Traditional Leaders chairman Sipho Mahlangu, and his deputy Nosandi Mhlauli. The meeting was aimed at discussing how the issue of land expropriation without compensation would affect land under traditional authorities. Yesterday, after the three-day summit, Mahlangu from Mpumalanga said amakhosi will never allow people to have title deeds because they will sell their land and become poor afterwards. On Wednesday, Mkhize distanced himself and the ANC government from former president Kgalema Motlanthe’s recommendations that the land under amakhosi, especially that falling under Ingonyama Trust, be taken away.
