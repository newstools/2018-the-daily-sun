WHAT the people of Cape Town have been begging Mother Nature for, and was meant to bring salvation, has turned to a curse. Heavy rain has not only filled dams but also the houses of those on the bottom of the food chain. Floods in Lwandle, Strand, close to Cape Town, left many with no place to sleep after water flooded their homes on Saturday. “It is a difficult situation. We need the rain, but it is also making our lives difficult. What do we do? Pray that the rain goes away? I think not,” said Abongile Ningiza. “We need proper infrastructure. The government needs to plan ahead.” It was difficult for the SunTeam to access houses in Greenfields in Lwandle due to the flooding. Nokuzola Mtyenene, mother of three, said the rain had become one of the community’s greatest burdens. “The houses were built more than 10 years ago and no upgrades were done since. We are in trouble with rain as drains cannot swallow the water,” said Mtyenene. The City of Cape Town does not assist people living in RDP houses by providing relief. It only offers help to those living in shacks. Daily Sun ran a story last week in which residents were reportedly told to insure their houses if they needed assistance. Small business owners are also affected by the rain and Sibusiso Hadebe said they appreciate the little support they received from people. MMC for Area East, councillor Anda Ntsodo, acknowledged that they were facing a challenge with drains. “The city experienced quite severe storms over the past week, which has resulted in the drain issues. “City officials are in the process of clearing stormwater infrastructure within the area concerned,” he told the People’s Paper.
