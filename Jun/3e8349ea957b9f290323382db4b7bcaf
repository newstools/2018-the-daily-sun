CAPE Town mayor Patricia de Lille’s legal fees have gone up to R1 million. This came after she took the DA to court three times in connection with the party’s attempts to remove her from her position. On Wednesday she won her latest case when the Western Cape High Court ruled the DA had acted unlawfully when De Lille’s party membership was withdrawn. But De Lille said she would not be paying the costs from her own pocket, as the DA had lost all the cases. “For all three cases, the court has ruled the DA must pay the costs and it is way over R1 million already. So the DA has to pay all my legal costs. “I have made an investment in myself personally because for me, my name, my integrity and my reputation are priceless.” She was at the high court again yesterday to force the DA to release the so-called Steenhuisen report, which linked her to corruption allegations. De Lille said: “We live in a democracy and I am entitled to natural justice. “I am the accused and I am entitled to get the evidence of what I am accused of, so I can prepare my response. “I still insist that any disciplinary hearing must be open to the public and the media, but this request has been refused by the DA.” The matter was delayed to 1 November as De Lille’s lawyers were not given enough time to write to the court. De Lille said because she did not have the evidence against her, it was difficult to prepare for her disciplinary hearing. Meanwhile, sources said the DA caucus in the City of Cape Town were planning another motion of no confidence in De Lille.
