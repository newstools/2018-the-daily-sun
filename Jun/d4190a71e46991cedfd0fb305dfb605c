THE three men were offloading boxes of groceries containing everything from baby food to tooth paste. Everything looked normal as they carried the load into the small shop. But when cops asked where the goods came from, they ended up busting the men for robbery! The three men allegedly stole groceries from a truck they planned to later report as hijacked. However, cops in Welkom, Free State, were waiting for them and pounced on Sunday. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said Matlhoko Moalosi (46), Ali Hider (33) and Francisco Sardinha (49) were arrested after members of the Welkom K9 unit and the Thabong crime intelligence unit followed up on a tip-off. They were told the truck, which was travelling from Joburg to Bloemfontein, had R800 000 worth of groceries loaded on it. According to the tip-off, a fake hijacking case was to have been registered after the groceries had been offloaded in Welkom. “Cops spotted the truck at Pulie’s Kitchen on Power Road and approached the people offloading groceries, who matched the information given by an informer,” he said. “It’s believed the driver was going to report a false case of hijacking in Theunissen. “Three suspects were interrogated and couldn’t provide police with a proper explanation. They were arrested and charged with theft and conspiracy to commit a crime.” Thakeng said police seized large quantities of Oros, baby food, jam, peanut butter, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, baked beans, toothpaste, soap and washing powder. “The three appeared in the Welkom Magistrates Court and the case was postponed to tomorrow for a bail application,” Thakeng told Daily Sun.
