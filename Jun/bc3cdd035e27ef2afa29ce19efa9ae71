PRETORIA cops are investigating a business robbery after a jewellery store was robbed inside the Menlyn Mall on Monday evening. It's reported that four unknown men who were wearing beanies and hats entered the mall, they then proceeded to the Vault store where they used a hammer to smash the display window. Police spokesperson Captain Colette Weilbach said an unknown amount of Rolex watches were stolen. "Security officers from the mall tried to stop the suspects as they tried to flee the mall in two white vehicles of which one was a BMW at Gobie Street. The suspects then fired shots at the security before speeding off in an unknown direction.Â  No one was injured during the incident," Weilbach said. Weilbach urged communities to report any suspicious people and vehicles especially ones without number plates or circumstances to the police immediately. The suspects are still at large and anybody that can assist the Brooklyn SAPS with information can contact the station at 012 3661735/6.
