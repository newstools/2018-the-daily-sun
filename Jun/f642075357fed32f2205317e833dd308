THE women of prayer met like they normally do on Thursdays. But this past Thursday, the group from a church in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni did not even get to say their prayers. Abomama Bomthandazo stood and watched in horror as one of their members collapsed and died while preaching. Not knowing what had happened, they called paramedics, who certified the woman dead. The police opened an inquest docket. They said a post mortem would determine the cause of death. Katlehong police spokesman Captain Mega Ndobe confirmed to Daily Sun that they were investigating an inquest after a 67-year-old woman collapsed and died in the church at Khumalo section. “A woman who was preaching fell on the ground at about 3.15pm,” said Ndobe. “According to the women at the prayer, the woman looked excited while preaching and it was a surprise to them when she collapsed.”
