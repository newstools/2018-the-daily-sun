HE CAME into the shop, pulled out a gun and demanded that the shopkeeper light his cigarette. Then he blew smoke in the shopkeeper’s face and robbed the store at gunpoint. Business owner Bayu Buzuayenu (28) said: “I was in shock and I thought the man was going to shoot me in front of my customers.” He said a thug wearing a black hoodie came into the shop in Clocolan, Free State at about 6pm on Saturday. Bayu said after the man demanded he light his cigarette, he robbed him of two cellphones and R2 500 from the cash register. “I ran out and called for help,” he said. Another business owner, Datemo Usan (22), said: “I thought the man was joking when he smiled and asked me to light his cigarette but then he pulled out a gun.” Datemo said the man even offered him a smoke. “I thought it was my last day on earth,” said Datemo. The robbery happened at about 6.20pm in the same kasi. “I was robbed of my three cellphones, ten packs of cigarettes and R4 800 in cash,” said the shopkeeper. But the man didn’t get far because cops had already been alerted. Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said: “A case of robbery has been opened and a 30-year-old man arrested.” The suspect is expected to appear in the Clocolan Magistrates Court today.
