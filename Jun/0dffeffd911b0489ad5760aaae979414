EVEN when Johanna Molobela is home alone, she can sense the thing making her life hell as it moves about like a shadow. Sometimes when she comes home she’ll find evil things like blood or worms in her yard. But it’s at night that Johanna’s hell comes to its full horror. That’s when the evil tokoloshe finally appears – as a naked mlungu! The 63-year-old from extension 5 in Mamelodi, eastern Tshwane, told Daily Sun that the mlungu tokoloshe sleeps with her every night. She said sometimes it came wearing men’s clothes and other times it is stark naked. Johanna said when she left food in her fridge or cupboard, the evil thing ate it or trashed it. She said that she was unable to keep money and there wasn’t peace in her home. Johanna said her problems started in 2009 when she divorced her husband. She said during the day, the invisible thing walks around the house. “I can see its shadow. “This house is scary. I always feel as if I’m with someone even when I am all alone because I can sense it.” Johanna said when she returned home from running errands she’d often find shocking things in her yard. “I have found blood and sometimes I see worms in the yard. I am a very neat person so I always make sure my yard is clean,” she said. “My family has no peace and nothing is going right because of this evil thing.” “I have consulted prophets and sangomas and they all said that it will end up killing me.” She pleaded with SunReaders to help her fight the tokoloshe. “I want to enjoy my home and have peace in my life,” she said. Sangoma Sibongile Maluleke said evil people sent the thing to destroy Johanna’s life. “It could be a tokoloshe or a ghost. She can use snuff to communicate with her ancestors and the creature. “But she need to get a sangoma who will get rid of the creature,” she said.
