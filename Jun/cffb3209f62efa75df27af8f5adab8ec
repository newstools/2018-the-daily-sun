WHEN the Dlaminis failed to find the missing Thulani (44), who disappeared in 1994, they called off the search. But now the family from Umlazi N section, south of Durban, have to start the search all over again. Their mum died in 2012 and left the house to her children, including Thulani. Their water supply was recently cut off due to an important document that requires his signature. His sister Sibongile (60) said: “The eThekwini Municipality cut off our water supply last month. We were told we needed to appoint a new family head because my mum’s name was no longer usable as she died in 2012.” She told Daily Sun they presented a new name, but officials rejected the document as Thulani’s signature was not on it. “They said we needed the signatures of all the children who were listed on the title deed. We don’t know where to find Thulani.” Sibongile said they’d now turned to the Durban Magistrates Court, but the court said it was unable to help if there was no proof Thulani was missing. Sibongile said Thulani went missing when the family went to consult a prophet in Umzimkhulu to find out what was causing his sudden disturbed mental state. She said while they were waiting to be seen by the prophet, Thulani said he was going to the toilet – and they never saw him again. Sibongile said they opened a missing person’s case shortly after Thulani vanished. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said they could reopen a missing persons case, even though it’s been 24 years since Thulani went missing.
