DEFENDING champions Ndengeza FC will be out to make history at this year’s 18th edition of the Maimane Alfred Phiri Games. Ndengeza, who defeated Black Poison in last year’s senior tournament, want to become the first team at the popular event to win the trophy back to back. Since its inception no team has been able to successfully defend a Map Games title. The highly anticipated senior portion of the off-season tournament will kick off tomorrow with the preliminary round fixtures starting at Alexandra Rotary Grounds at 9am. This weekend, 16 teams will battle it out to make the Round of 32 scheduled for next weekend. Four games will be played tomorrow and the other four on Sunday. The draw for the Last 32 round will take place on Tuesday. Ndengeza will start their quest of defending the title next weekend after learning on Tuesday whom they will face in the opening match. They currently play in the ABC Motsepe League in Limpopo but they are based in Diepkloof, Soweto. Chairman Akani Siweya says they have added new, hungry players to the core of the team that won last year and want to repeat that feat. Said Siweya: “This year our team is even better than the one we had last year. The boys know each other, they have blended well and we don’t pick players like other teams, we make our own stars.” However, Siweya is concerned because his boys tend to go off the rails. “One thing we need to improve is discipline. We need to behave better than last year and stay positive.”
