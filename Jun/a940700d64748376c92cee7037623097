THEY value their cars and so they always parked them in their yards. But now the residents of Ivory Park 2 near Tembisa, Ekurhuleni have to park their cars outside as they can’t drive into their street anymore. They accuse the local Methodist Church of hijacking their street. The resident said the church extended its yard and subsequently swallowed a large chunk of the street. All that remains now is the street sign which shows where Mmabatho Street used to be. They said the church didn’t even consult them. “We just saw the wall being built right in the middle of the road. Before we knew it, we were left squeezed in a passage,” said an angry resident. The fuming residents threatened to break down the wall to get their street back. “This is nonsense. They came after us but suddenly, they want to take over everything. What’s left is for them to take over our yards,” said Martha Manganye. Church spokeswoman Jodene Louw said they had consulted the relevant people. City of Joburg spokesman Virgil James said they would send officials to assess the situation.
