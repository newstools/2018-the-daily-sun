Economic
Freedom Fighter’s Julius Malema has hit out against Indians, accusing them of
being racist. His
comments, however, did not go down well with social media. Shortly
after, they were calling him out for his remarks. Malema made
the remarks during a Youth Day event in Klerksdorp, North West. “We must
not forget that apartheid oppressed us. There was a hierarchy of oppression.
Indians were better off than coloureds; coloureds were better off than
Africans,” he said, addressing the crowd at Matlosana Stadium. “We were
not oppressed the same. Our oppression was worse than the oppression of the
Indians. That’s why in the liberation movement we used to say ‘we are fighting
for the liberation of blacks in general and Africans in particular. “Majority
of Indians hate Africans. Majority of Indians are racist, and we must never be
scared to say that they are racist. I’m not saying all Indians. I’m saying
majority of them,” he said. Malema also
took shots at coloureds. “The same
applies to some coloured brothers. They see themselves as being more white than
black. It’s a reality we have to deal with.” He came
under heavy fire from users on social media. “I was
shocked to wake to watch Fury and Fire from Julius Malema towards Indians
community. It is shocking even though some of the things he uttered have truth
but he so destructive to race relations a great leader tells the truth but not
crates hatred,” tweeted @EnochMthembu. “Julius
Malema your racial comments are totally uncalled for. First the whites; now the
Indians— are the coloureds next? “I can't
understand why you have so much animosity to your fellow citizens,” tweeted
@winnie5689. "What
example are you setting for your children?”
