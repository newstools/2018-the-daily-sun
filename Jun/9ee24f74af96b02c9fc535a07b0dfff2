GORDON Pheko (39) was happy working for his three kids at a construction site, where he helped to dig trenches for a sewerage system. But then tragedy struck! Tons of soil came crushing down on Gordon and his two colleagues. His co-workers managed to get out of the way, but Gordon’s kids were left without their father when he was buried alive. Some of the workers immediately used their picks and shovels to try to dig Gordon out of the grave, as an excavation machine was not available. When police arrived it was too late. The incident that left the workers traumatised and saddened happened in Lebaleng township in Makwassie, near Wolmaransstad in North West. One of the men who miraculously escaped was critically injured and is fighting for his life at Klerksdorp Hospital. Gordon’s mum said her son was the breadwinner of the family and had left a pregnant girlfriend. The family said they did not know what they would do about his burial. Gordon’s uncle, Reginald Mopeloa (49), said the family was still waiting for the representative from Ditiro Tsa Ka Construction to explain to them what had happened. It seems there were no safety measures to stop the soil from falling, as the walls of the trench were cracked. Reginald said he had to go to the family of the injured worker, Alfred Maerman (32), to inform them as well, as no one from the construction company had visited them. “Both the contractor and the Maquassi Hills Municipality should take responsibility and bury Gordon. They shoud cover medical costs for the injured. “I have arranged for the rest of the workers to receive trauma counselling,” said Reginald. Foxx Phokoje, owner of Ditiro Tsa Ka, said he still had to meet the family and promised to comment later, as he wanted to get more information. Maquassi spokesman McCaswell Khumalo also promised to get answers and comment later, but at the time of going to print last night he had not done so.
