BHABHA Dlamini has never had an ID in his life. The 30-year-old from Nokweja outside Ixopo, KZN, said he has been trying to get his ID for the past 10 years but with no success. Bhabha lost his parents when he was 16 and he’s been struggling to apply for an ID ever since. “Every time I apply for an ID, Home Affairs officials say I should bring a relative because my parents died,” Bhabha told the People’s Paper. “My only relative lives in Namibia and I don’t have money to go and fetch her because I’m unemployed.” He said he survives on hand-outs and leftovers given to him by neighbours.” Neighbour Ntombikayise Ntshiza (58) said: “I often cook extra food to give to Bhabha. “I knew his mum very well before she died. “I hope the young man will get help so he can apply for an ID.” Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Makgola asked the SunTeam to sent him Bhabha’s contact details so he could talk to the provincial office.
