IT LOOKED like a regular kasi yard, but it was actually a gold processing plant. The zama zamas had opened a plant in Chris Hani extension 1 in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni. The plant that had been operating for months was shut down by police on Tuesday. Equipment worth thousands was taken as well as two vehicles with damaged VIN numbers and false number plates. Three suspects found at the shack were arrested. Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago, spokesman for the Ekurhuleni Metro cops, said: “Two stolen vehicles were recovered and three undocumented Zimbabweans were arrested. “The equipment at the plant was seized. He said they also recovered 18 phenduka machines for gold refining, eight generators, two bottles of mercury and R11 000 in cash. “The three suspects aged 30, 31 and 33 were arrested in connection with illegal mining and possession of stolen motor vehicles,” said Kgasago. The suspects are expected to appear in the Daveyton Magistrates Court soon.
