THE Nokuthula School for pupils with special needs was opened in October amid great excitement about the benefits it would bring. The new school in Lyndhurst, Joburg, can cater for 560 pupils and construction cost almost R250 million. But to this day, the school grounds remain empty! The Gauteng portfolio committee on infrastructure development wants to know why the school is still unoccupied. The committee gave the department of infrastructure development until Thursday to explain why the Education Department hasn’t received the school’s occupancy certificate. The school is supposed to cater for pupils with special needs, including those who suffer from autism, slow learners, and those with disabilities. The SunTeam visited the premises and found a ghost school. Not a single child was in sight and there was only one guard. The committee said in a statement: “The understanding was that the school would be occupied and used in January 2018, but it has remained a white elephant for over eight months.” It said it had rejected a report from the department. “It did not provide any answers as to why, eight months down the line, the occupancy certificate has not been issued, who was responsible to allow this, and how long they will take to issue the certificate to allow occupation of the school,” said the committee. But Infrastructure Development MEC Jacob Mamabolo told Daily Sun plans were already under way to integrate the pupils from the old school in Marlboro. “The school was meant to have been reopened in the sense of relocating pupils,” he said. “In consultation with the department, we were made to understand that the best way of relocating pupils, given their special needs, was to do it during school holidays. “The relocation process will be completed then, and in the second semester they will move to the school.” He said they did not want to disrupt learning activities.
