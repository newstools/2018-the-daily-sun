CANDLES were lit around Australia on Monday evening in
memory of a young woman who was raped and murdered walking home after
performing in Melbourne. According to the BBC, Eurydice Dixon's body was found
dumped on a football field in inner-city Melbourne in the early hours of
Wednesday. Sometime before the alleged attack, Eurydice reportedly
sent a text message to a friend saying: "I'm almost home safe, HBU [how
about you]." Jaymes Todd (19) has since been charged with her rape and
murder. They apparently didnâ€™t know each other, said cops. Vigils were held for Eurydice from Melbourne to Sydney,
Canberra, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane. Many are outraged at the continuing high levels of sexual
abuse in Australia, mostly against women. According to government figures, one in five women, and
one in 20 men, have experienced sexual violence or threats since the age of 15.
