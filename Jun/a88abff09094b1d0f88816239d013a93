ITUMELENG Olyn (34) from Hostel 1 in Mangaung, Free State, was devastated when his girlfriend was killed in a car accident. However, many are confused by the way in which he is mourning his loss. Itumeleng is showing sorrow for the death by wearing his former girlfriend’s wig! Sheila Dlabu died three weeks ago after she was run over by a car at a tombstone unveiling. Itumeleng said wearing Sheila’s wig comforts him. “As soon as I wear my dead girlfriend’s wig I feel at peace. “One of her wigs was only worn on special occasions. I bought it last year after I got paid. I had never seen her as happy as she was when I gave it to her. “People think I have lost my mind or turned gay, but that does not bother me. “I do not wear the wig every day. I put it on three times a week. “When I die I want to be buried with this wig so I can give it to her in the afterlife.”
