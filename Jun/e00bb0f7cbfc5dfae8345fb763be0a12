THOKO Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said she’d approach the court before the end of the week over schools shaving the hair of Shembe kids. The head of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities was speaking in Durban yesterday. This comes after several pupils at Umphumulo Primary School in Maphumulo, northern KZN, complained that their teachers had called the cops to cut their hair. Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said the commission would take the teachers and cops to court for violating the pupils’ religious rights. “Teachers and cops aren’t hairstylists and should focus on what they’re employed to do, not shaving pupils’ hair,” she said. “Terrorising pupils leaves them and their parents traumatised, which might lead to them failing at the end of the year.” The chairwoman said they would involve Ipid and the Education Department, whose employees were terrorising pupils. Thabo Sambothi, an activist against the abuse of Shembe pupils, said he was happy the commission was taking the matter seriously. He said it left pupils and parents traumatised. “We’ve done everything required of us to prove the kids belong to a church that doesn’t allow their hair to be shaved,” he said. “We’ve spoken to schools many times and written letters stating that it’s the belief of our church that hair shouldn’t be shaved. “But they’ve continued doing it, which is why we approached the commission.” Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said no case had been opened against the cops. “I’ll check with the Maphumulo cop shop to hear what they have to say about the matter,” she said.
