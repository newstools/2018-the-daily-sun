While being a famous actor is one of the coolest jobs in the world, it also has a few downsides. Skeem Saam actress Lerato Marabe, who plays the role of the rather forward Pretty Seakamela on the popular SABC 1 soap, has shared her first unpleasant encounter with a fan. Speaking to Drum Magazine, the star revealed how she was once slapped by a fan at a local fast food outlet. "In high school my friends and I decided to go to KFC after school. So while we were waiting in the queue, this one lady walked up to me and slapped me across the face because of the story-line at the time,‚Äù she told the publication. "I was so upset, I called my mother and asked her to pick me up because I just couldn't believe it," she said. The young actress is not the first one to have such an encounter, many actors, especially those playing villainous characters, have shared similar experiences.
