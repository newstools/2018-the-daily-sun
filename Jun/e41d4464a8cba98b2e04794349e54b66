THERE was yet another cash-in-transit heist on Monday. This time, thugs pounced on G4S security guards collecting money from the Frontier Hotel in Mount Frere, Eastern Cape at about 3pm. Hotel supervisor Nwabisa Sogwadla said one security guard was guarding the money truck while the other was on his way out with the cash when the thugs emerged. “We heard one gunshot and while we were still in shock, the security guard ran back inside, with a young man following him,” she said. “The young man fired two shots and demanded that the guard hand over the money to him. One man entered the hotel while four others waited outside. They fled with more than R257 000.” Sogwadla said one of her cashiers was grazed by a bullet. “We had to close the business for the rest of the day,” she said. Police spokeswoman Captain Edith Mjoko said: “One guard collected the bags from the hotel and on his way out, he saw five armed men approaching. He was shot in the chest and was rushed to hospital. “Five men fled the scene with the cash and two of the guards’ firearms. No one has been arrested but a case of business robbery was opened.”
