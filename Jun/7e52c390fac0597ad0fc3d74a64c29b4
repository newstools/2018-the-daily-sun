TWO years ago, Khayalethu Mbuyisa saw a beautiful wall clock in the building where he lives. He was so fascinated he thought of coming up with something similar. Now the 35-year-old from Nelspruit in Mpumalanga told Daily Sun he was overwhelmed by the response he’s been getting from people across the continent. “After seeing the outdoor clock, I started searching for the sellers of its material,” he said. “After finding it I made my own clock in my house and shared the image on social media. “People praised my work, and since then I have been installing 3D wall clocks.” Khayalethu said he was getting orders from many people, including people from Nigeria, Swaziland and Lesotho. “I’m a professional photographer, but the job of making the 3D wall clocks keeps me busy,” he told the People’s Paper. “I often have to balance my time and ensure that my customers are happy.” Khayalethu said even though he hasn’t travelled outside the country, he was busy working on it. He said there are processes to be followed if a person wants to do business in other countries.
