MPUMALANGA Community Safety MEC Pat Ngomane on Sunday sent out a strong warning to corrupt police officers at Acornhoek cop shop, Bushbuckridge. Ngomane was responding to questions raised by residents during a safety and security imbizo at Ehlanzeni TVET College. “I am going to deal with those bad apples because this is not the first time I’ve heard about corrupt cops at this station,” said Ngomane. Residents claimed the cops only respond to calls for assistance when the victims belong to their favourite political party. They also accused the police of working with criminals. “Police don’t work for any political party. “They must love their job and treat residents equally. “They are here to protect the community,” said the MEC. He said he will instruct the station commander to investigate the matter and give feedback within three weeks. Ngomane also criticised mums for hiding their kids when they break the law. He said the only time these mums speak out is when their children rape them. “I know how much you love your sons. “But why do you hide them when they are wanted for murder and robbery? “Don’t panic. “Your children won’t be killed in prison. “They will be rehabilitated and learn skills. “Let’s work together to fight crime and substance abuse.”
