MZANSI is readying itself for the annual circumcision season. In provinces such as the Eastern Cape, many initiation deaths are reported each year during this period. Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders chairman Malesela Dikgale said the province’s preparations for the initiation season are at an advanced stage. “We will not leave anything to chance because we are dealing with the lives of initiates,” said Dikgale. “A workshop will be held to show people how things should be done. “We have a record number of registered school owners. “So far, we have 455. Last year we had 269.” Dikgale said his organisation is worried about death of initiates in provinces like the Eastern Cape. He also warned the owners of unregistered schools not to take chances as they would be identified and punished. Traditional surgeon Mashudu Tshikororo, who has run 21 schools since 1996, said he and his colleagues are ready for the initiation season. Tshikororo said his initiation school will be in Vyeboom, Vuwani.
