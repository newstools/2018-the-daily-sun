Since unveiling the current generation XC90 in 2014
Volvo has been on roll. Volvo's decision to stop trying to be all sporty
and dynamic as their German rivals and just focus on what they do best proved
to be what they needed. The XC90 and every car that has followed since has
managed to get Volvo back to its winning ways. It's been a while since the word sport or sporty
has featured prominently in Volvo's car launches That all changed though with the recent unveiling
of the S60. Volvo calls the new S60 a sports sedan, lookout BMW
3 series. The new S60 is the first Volvo to be built in the
US. It sits on top of the now familiar Scalable Product
Architecture platform found in the current car of the year, the XC60. “The active chassis and drive modes deliver
excellent control and an engaged performance that makes this a driver’s car,”
said Henrik Green, senior vice president for research and development at Volvo
Cars. Green also says that the S60 will be the best
sports sedans in the segment. No oil-burners for the new baby. Volvo is charging
ahead to ensure that all its new models in 2019 be electrified. The 2.0-litre petrol engine can be had in all sorts
of flavours. A turbocharged unit with 184 kW will be found in
the T5. The T5 is front wheel drive only; power is managed by an 8-Speed
automatic like in all the cars in the range. The T6 comes with all-wheel drive, 229 kW and a hot
hatch beating 0-100km/h dash of 5.6 seconds. The Twin Engine T6 plug-in hybrid
system produces 254 kW. The T8 Twin Engine Plug-in hybrid comes in two
flavours, the 'normal' T8 comes packing 287 kW and it will do the 0-100/km/h
dash in 4.9 seconds. The Polestar Engineered T8 will do 0-100km/h in 4.7
seconds thanks to the spruced up engine and with 297 kW. The Polestar Engineered also T8 also gets sportier
suspension breaks and wheels. Inside it's everything we've come to expect from
Volvo. I must say the interior design looks good, but it's kinda getting tired.
The new S60 will hit showrooms floors in 2019.
