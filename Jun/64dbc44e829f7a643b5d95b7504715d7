HIS lover was brutally stabbed to death on Wednesday, allegedly by her own son. Mbukiseni Khuzwayo apparently saw the tragedy unfold and wants the son arrested. He told cops they should also arrest a sangoma who allegedly told his lover’s son his mother had lied to him. Nomvula Majozi (58) was stabbed to death after her son allegedly accused her of lying to him about who his real dad was. Mbukiseni (59) from Umlazi K section, south of Durban, told Daily Sun that before Nomvula was stabbed, her son allegedly told them he’d gone to see a sangoma after noticing he had a bad luck streak. “The sangoma told him he was using the wrong surname,” said Mbukiseni. “That’s why he demanded to know who his real father is. “The police should also arrest the sangoma because he or she is the reason Nomvula was killed. “A real sangoma could have foreseen the danger of revealing such information.” Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a murder case was opened at Bhekithemba cop shop. He said allegations against the sangoma could be investigated.
