Polokwane cops have arrested an off-duty traffic officer aged 42-year-old following a shooting spree. It is alleged that three girls aged between the ages of 13 and 17 were walking on the street when the suspect insulted them. Following that an exchange of words ensued between the man and the youngsters until he chased them with his motor vehicle. According to Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe the incident occurred at Greenside between Ext 44 and 40, a township around the Westenburg area. The suspect apparently fired several shots in the direction of the children injuring a 17-year-old girl in the process. The police and the Medical Emergency Services were called and immediately responded leading to the apprehension of the suspect and the confiscation of his private firearm. "The victim was rushed to the local hospital where she was treated and is recuperating at home. Further police investigations are still being conducted to establish the circumstances of the shooting," Ngoepe said. Ngoepe said legal gun owners are reminded to always comply with the provisions of the firearm Controls Act. He further said any contravention of this Act may result in the owner being declared unfit to possess a firearm in addition to the criminal charges that will be pressed against him/her. The suspect will appear in the Polokwane Magistrate Court soon facing on a charge of attempted murder.
