TWO weeks ago, residents blocked a road with rocks and branches. At the time, the people of Josefa Village, outside Malamulele in Limpopo, said they took over Punda Maria Road to show the local municipality their anger over not having running water. Residents said they had been living without water for an entire year and were at their wit’s end. However, after SunPower stepped in and an article about the situation was published, they saw results. Water was restored to the village last Friday! Xivumbeko Maswanganyi (13) said he was over the moon. “It has been terrible going to school every day without having a bath,” he said. “I can’t wait to wash myself and smell good.” More than 2 000 village residents were forced to get water from a well in the bush or to pay for water brought in on bakkies. Villager Tintwalo Baloyi (37) celebrated when the water came back. “We thank Daily Sun for coming to the rescue. We are so happy to have clean water in our taps,” said Tintwalo. “When the paper became involved, we knew the problem would be solved quickly.”
