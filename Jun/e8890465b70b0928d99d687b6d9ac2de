Zimbabwean former president Robert Mugabe was reportedly "rushed" out of the country after his health "suddenly deteriorated" two weeks ago. The privately-owned NewsDay quoted a highly placed source as confirming that the veteran politician was flown to Singapore for medical check-ups.  "He (Mugabe) slipped out of the country two weeks ago after his blood pressure suddenly rose to dangerous levels. He also had trouble with his eye which previously has been diagnosed with a cataract," the source was cited as saying. In December 2017, he was spotted leaving a lift in Gleneagles Hospital in downtown Singapore, accompanied by at least eight people, according to AFP. Mugabe ruled the southern African country with an iron fist for 37 years.
