ANGRY parents and SGB members blocked the entrance to the Durban School for the Hearing Impaired in Amanzimtoti yesterday. They demanded that education authorities suspend a teacher who allegedly put kids with disabilities in chains! A video clip showing a little school boy in chains went viral on social networks last month. Angry parents, led by SGB members, said the department had failed to take action. SGB chairwoman Sibongile Mthi demanded that the acting principal and teacher who allegedly chained up kids be removed from the school. “We were shocked to learn the teacher who allegedly chained a pupil living with a disability was still working at school,” said Mthi. “We don’t understand how education officials could allow an abusive teacher to continue working. “We want the authorities to get rid of the principal. He’s undermining parents.” Mthi said the former principal still had signing powers over school funds. Circuit manager Mbusi Mvuyana tried to calm parents and asked them to allow the SGB to meet to resolve the problems. The school’s HOD refused to comment. She said the allegations were still being investigated by the department. Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi told the People’s Paper that the department had already sent officials to the school to investigate the disturbing allegations. He said they were awaiting the officials’ report.
