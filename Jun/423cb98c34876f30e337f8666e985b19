BAFANA Bafana coach Stuart Baxter has made three changes to the team that will take on Namibia in the plate semi-final on Tuesday, at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane, kick-off at 5pm. Baxter has handed two new caps to Siyabonga Ngezana of Kaizer Chiefs, as well as Egypt-based Gift Links. Reyaad Pieterse keeps his place in goal while Siyanda Xulu and Motjeka Madisha joins Ngezana in a three-man defence. Wiseman Meyiwa slots into the middle of the park where he will operate alongside Fortune Makaringe, with Maphosa Modiba and Siphesihle Ndlovu on the left and right wings respectively. Links and Lebohang Maboe will play a supporting role to main striker Ryan Moon. Missing out from the last clash against Madagascar are Taariq Fielies, Luther Singh and Gift Motupa, with the latter out of the squad due to a family bereavement. In the other plate semi-final fixture, Swaziland faces Botswana tonight at 19h30, also at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium. The winners will contest the Plate final on Friday, June 8 at the New Peter Mokaba Stadium. Bafana Bafana XI: Reyaad Pieterse (GK), Siyanda Xulu (c), Motjeka Madisha, Siyabonga Ngezana, Maphosa Modiba, Fortune Makaringe, Wiseman Meyiwa, Siphesihle Ndlovu, Gift Links, Lebohang Maboe, Ryan Moon.
