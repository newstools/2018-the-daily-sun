RESIDENTS of KwaMachi in Harding, southern KZN, believe they’re sitting on a gold mine. But local government said it will take two months to see whether gold is worth mining in the area. Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala said they’d sent geologists to test the stones residents believe contain gold. “We expect geologists from the mineral resources department to give us the report in two months’ time,” said Zikalala . “They’re doing tests in the area to see if there’s potential for gold exploration.” Zikalala met stakeholders, including KwaMachi traditional leaders and Umuziwabantu municipal leaders on Sunday. After the meeting, they went to the place where people said they’d found the stones they believed were gold nuggets. All the residents were kept outside the 2m-high barbed wire fence. He said they had agreed at the meeting not to allow residents near the place, because geologists don’t want to be disturbed while doing tests. Zikalala said there’s no evidence of a gold mine. He said they had heard that kids bunk school and hang around the area, trying to sell the stones. Councillor Jabulani Ngubelanga said: “We’ve told them to go back to school. I believe they’ve listened.” He said residents will be informed of the results when they’re out. “Gold or no gold, we’ll do everything according to the law,” he said.
