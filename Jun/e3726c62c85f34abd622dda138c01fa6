THE Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality has started securing all graveyards with a strong perimeter fence. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “The days of cattle grazing at cemeteries and criminals using graveyards as hideouts will soon be a thing of the past. “The municipality has listened to the cries of the people who have their loved ones buried in our cemeteries. “Millions of rands have been set aside and the contractors appointed to revamp and improve the spaces.” Last Thursday, member of the mayoral committee for public health Lance Grootboom visited Motherwell Cemetery, where work has already started. Grootboom said R8 million was set aside to fence the cemetery. “A strong concrete slab will be added to strengthen it. “We have budgeted R8 million for Motherwell Cemetery and R5 million for Forest Hill Cemetery, where vandalism is high. “We will then start securing all cemeteries after completing these two graveyards,” said Grootboom. “It has been discovered that when a cemetery is secured and fenced, crime drops significantly. “At many of our cemeteries, people are robbed and raped when visiting their loved ones’ graves. “We expect to complete fencing the two graveyards later this month. We will also be providing round the clock security. “People will be assisted and escorted to their loved ones’ graves. Security will be tight.” Gregory Kops, director of parks and cemeteries, said the municipality had spent about R6 million to build a storm water drain at Motherwell Cemetery. “Water was destroying graves, making it difficult for people to visit their relatives’ graves. “The water was also a health hazard because it was stagnant all the time. “I am happy that the storm water drain is operating and we will not see any stagnant water again.”
