A FORMER addict used to live a life of fear and shame about not being a proper father and husband. He was constantly wanting a fix and thinking of suicide. But today, he says, he’s the proudest man walking this earth. “I thought I was finished. “I can’t tell you about the shame of being a useless husband and irresponsible dad. It is the worst humiliation any man can face. “There was this feeling that I should end it once and for all. I tried overdosing but it was not enough to kill me, so I’m still here today.” His drug of choice used to be rock or crack cocaine but now the man has been clean for over six years. A year after stopping drugs, he and colleagues formed the first Narcotics Anonymous group in Soweto, based in Diepkloof. Today there are three groups, including Dube and Pimville. On Saturday, the former addict (38) and other members of Narcotics Anonymous will be meeting at 9am at Diepkloof Multipurpose centre in Zone 3, Diepkloof in an awareness campaign to spread the message to addicts. They want to show them it is possible to live a drug-free life. “We are inviting addicts to hear and see for themselves former users who have many months and years of living without drugs. I don’t want them to suffer like me as I didn’t know where to turn. Families are welcome too.” Attending and being a member of the group is free. The former addict is grateful his marriage never ended in divorce and being a great dad means the world to him. He visits schools, churches and helps families with counselling.
