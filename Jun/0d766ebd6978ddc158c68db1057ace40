A GROUP of farmworkers in Addo, outside Port Elizabeth said their living conditions are worse than those in a pigsty. The workers live in a tent that has big holes in it. “We live like animals. There is no floor, the roof leaks and sewage flows around the tent,” said one worker. Another worker said: “This tent is cold. We covered the ground with blankets because there is no floor.” Vuyisile Sikani, chairman of Sundays River Workers Forum, said the employees deserve proper accommodation. “This is why we are forcing farm owners to improve the lives of their workers,” he said. A farm manager said he was not aware of the sewage problem. He said: “The workers’ living facilities are well maintained. “The tent is five months old and could have been damaged recently by strong winds. “The sewerage pipes could have burst during the strike because people are afraid to move around and inspect the facilities when there is violence on the farms. I will fix everything after the strike.” Farmworkers in the area have been on strike since last Thursday, demanding higher wages.
