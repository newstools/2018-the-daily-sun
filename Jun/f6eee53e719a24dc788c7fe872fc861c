THE department of education’s accelerated early grade reading programme was held on Tuesday in Bloemfontein. The programme, which focuses on African home languages and English, is aimed at ensuring that primary school pupils are able to read. It kicked off in 2011 in Thabo Mofutsanyane and will be implemented in four other districts by 2019. There are about 150 schools in the province’s five districts. Free State Education MEC Tate Makgoe said Save the Children and USAid supported the department financially. She said their grants would help increase the number of books in primary schools, improve teachers’ skills, and make school exciting for young ones. “They should look forward to going to school,” said Makgoe. “If we can change the levels of education in lower grades, we can ensure children start reading extensively in the foundation phase. “That will make it easier for them when they reach high school because they will be fluent readers.” The MEC said children needed to start reading newspapers early in life to ensure a culture of reading in society. USAid acting mission director for Southern Africa, Rebecca Krzywda, told Daily Sun: “Reading at a young age helps children to excel at high school because they have a solid foundation. “I’d like to encourage parents at home to help their children in terms of reading books, magazines and newspapers every day.”
