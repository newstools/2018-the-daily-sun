Reneilwe “Yeye” Letsholonyane and his wife Mpho are one of Mzansi’s favourite couples and their relationship inspires many on social media. The pair has had their fair share of relationship problems, however they pale in comparison to the good times they have had together. Although they are very guarded when it comes to their relationship, they are not shy to give people a glimpse into their love life. Their love for one another is hard to miss, a little look at their respective social media accounts reveals their happiest moments together. They are currently living it up in the city of love, Paris, taking in all the beautiful sights and landmarks the city has to offer. “I’ve always wanted to come to Paris, eat some local eats and see the tower (amongst the other touristy stuff). To do it with my best friend has just been the bestest.  I’m such a happy girl,” Mpho wrote on Instagram. Check out the pictures from the French Getaway: Waking up with love and gratitude in my heart.
