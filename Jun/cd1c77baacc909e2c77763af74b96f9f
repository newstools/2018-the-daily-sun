CONDOLENCES are pouring in for Sir Javas. The DJ whose real name was Njabulo Nxumalo died of meningitis on Wednesday. Known for his hit single Makoya, he was one of the most popular musicians in Tshwane. The DJ’s aunt confirmed his death to the SunTeam and said the family was coping. ICYMI: SIR JAVAS LOSES MENINGITIS BATTLE The Tshwane entertainment industry is still shocked by the sudden loss. Precious Masimula of Tshwane All Stars, an NGO, said the death of her friend and colleague shattered her. “He was a good friend who always believed in people and tried to make everybody laugh. The Tshwane All Stars family has lost a soldier.” Thabz, the lead singer of kwaito group Thabz le Madonga, said Sir Javas had a great soul. He said: “Sir Javas respected his craft and always interacted with his fans. Whenever I wanted to quit the music industry he would motivate me to stay. I worked with him on many songs that have not yet been released.” His memorial service will be held at Block D Park in Mabopane tomorrow and there will be an event to honour him at the Europa Club in the Tshwane CBD on Thursday.
