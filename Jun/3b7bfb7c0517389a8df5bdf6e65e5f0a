QUICK acting cops bust a thug with his gang’s precious loot. The bust went down in Bultfontein, Free State on Tuesday when police raced to a reported break-in taking place. When the men in blue arrived at the scene, four thugs fled on foot but the driver of the getaway car wasn’t so lucky. He was sitting in a Toyota Corolla parked nearby. Police approached and asked to search him. It took cops little time to find copper cable as well as some tools of the trade, including a panga and bolt cutter. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said the suspect couldn’t produce documents for the copper cable. “Further investigations were conducted and it was discovered the cable was stolen from two municipal store rooms,” said Thakeng. “The locks of the doors had been cut open. The weight of the cable found in the thug’s possession was 268,5kg and valued at about R14 600. The suspect (40) appeared before the Bultfontein Magistrates Court and the case was postponed to Monday for a bail application. Bultfontein station commander Lieutenant-Colonel Harry Lekitlane praised the cops for their quick response.
