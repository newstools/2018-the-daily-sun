In Ga-Seleka outside Lephalale, a group of people calling themselves the "Ga-Seleka Concerned Group" blocked the D3110 road with their cars. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said they then hijacked a bus, as they intended to block the road with it. These cars were then towed away by to the police to the police station. “The police arranged for the spare key for the bus which was taken to town safely,” Ngoepe said. However, in Giyani, residents went on rampage and barricaded the R81 road between Giyani and Malamulele with sand and the sand was removed by the police and the road was cleared. Ngope said cases of public violence, intimidation and common robbery were opened. The Saps Acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Jan Scheepers said lawlessness will not be tolerated.
