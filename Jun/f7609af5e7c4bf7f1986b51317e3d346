TOP cops told parliament that they have tightened the screws on procurement processes in the police. This is to ensure no corruption takes place in tender processes. National police commissioner General Kehla Sitole said those who were in the bid adjudication and procurement department would also go through lifestyle audits, as well as vetting. Lieutenant-General Joe Mokwena said they had also put other measures in place. “All procurement approval above R300 000 will be finalised at national procurement level. “All requirements for bids above R500 000 must be finalised at the supply chain national level by the bid adjudication committee,” said Mokwena. Committee chairman Francois Beukman asked: “So there is no national treasury involvement?” Mokwena answered: “Yes.” He said cops were allowed to do their quotations without the intervention of the national procurement at the provincial level if the amount was less than R300 000. DA MP Zakhele Mbhele welcomed the changes being put in place to tighten up loopholes. “Against the backdrop of concessions, mismanagement and non-application of what should have been the basics, I think the committee will track the developments going forward.” Earlier this year MPs where told that the fight against corruption in the police was difficult because of challenges such as a lack of security clearance for senior crime intelligence officers. In March the police told MPs that 22 of the 51 senior managers did not have valid security clearance – and neither did 4 184 of the 7 437 crime intelligence police officials.
