CABALS, back-stabbing and divisions are just some of the reasons why Platinum Stars got relegated to the National First Division (NFD) twice in one season. They finished 16th at the end of the season but were given a lifeline when Ajax Cape Town were docked points and Stars got a spot in the promotion/relegation play-offs. But still they failed. Experienced midfielder, Enocent Mkhabela, says divisions among players and different camps within the club played a major role in their relegation in a season that saw them win a shocking six matches out of 30. He explains: “Many things did not go right for us in the past season. We were not united as a team. “There were too many groups for a single team. We were divided as players.” The 29-year-old launched his PSL career at Dikwena in 2011 before joining SuperSport United in the 2013-14 season. And he is thankful for getting the opportunity: “It is hurtful to see the team go down this way.” The Mpumalanga-born player was on the books of Kaizer Chiefs at one stage in 2016, during which time he saw little action. He eventually returned to Stars. “Leaving Chiefs was a blessing in disguise,” he said. “After that I started getting more game-time at Stars. But unfortunately here I am – relegated with the team that gave me my PSL debut. It is both disappointing and heartbreaking.” Mkhabela remains hopeful, however, that Roger de Sa’s side will make a comeback to the PSL: “We are hoping for better luck and a quick return to PSL football. As we go down to the NFD, teamwork will be key for us. “The past few months have been hectic but I personally need to man up and be strong. There are lessons to be learned throughout this journey. “I have learned that in life you must always be ready for anything.” Their woeful performance in the play-offs gave some indication of the divisions among Dikwena players, as they were unable to win any of the four play-off matches, losing two and drawing the other two.
