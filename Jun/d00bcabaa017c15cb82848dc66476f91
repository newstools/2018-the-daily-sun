A MOTHER from KwaMashu Hostel said it would take time for her family to get over the incident that left them traumatised. A mum and her two kids, aged four and two, are still traumatised after seeing a shoot-out between cops and thugs outside their shack on Friday morning. The incident led to death of two thugs while the third one was arrested after being shot by the police. The mum said they were woken by gun shots outside their shack. “When I heard the shots, I quickly pushed my kids to the floor because we sleep in the same bed. We lay on the floor until it was silent,” she said. She said later cops knocked at her door to check if anyone was hurt. Ever since the incident, they have been sleeping in her neighbour’s shack. “We will have to move out of this area because my kids are still in shock.” KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said the suspects had allegedly robbed a spaza shop on Thursday afternoon and while attempting to flee the scene, they hijacked a car. “The suspects shot and killed the owner of the car (45). “The man was with his two kids and a friend in the car,” said Naicker. “They then left the dead man’s car and hijacked another car before fleeing the scene.” He said the car was traced to KwaMashu Hostel. When police approached it, the suspects tried to escape but got stuck in one of the shacks. “A shoot-out broke out and led to the death of two suspects. A third suspect was later arrested by cops.” Naicker said an inquest docket was opened. Cops are investigating a case of attempted murder and possession of unlicenced firearms.
