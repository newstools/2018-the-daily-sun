THANDEKA Msibi is a worried young mum. The 26-year-old said her life has no meaning without an ID. “This problem is also affecting my four kids because they don’t have birth certificates,” said Thandeka, from Bethal in Mpumalanga. She said when she tried to get a copy of her birth certificate from Home Affairs, she was told her late mum registered another child born in the same year. “I was advised to trace the person who shared the same date of birth as me. “I managed to find the woman in KZN, but she denied knowing my mum,” Thandeka said. “When I told Home Affairs officials about the woman, they still wouldn’t help. “They said since my mother was no more, there was nothing they could. “My life is meaningless because I don’t have a birth certificate. “I can’t even apply for an ID. This is affecting my kids’ lives. “I am struggling to support them because I am not working, and they don’t get grants.” She said she didn’t even know her dad. “My mum never told me anything about my father. “My life is on hold because of this problem.” Thandeka told the People’s Paper she had been trying to apply for an ID for the past 11 years, with no success. She said officials told her they couldn’t remove the name of the woman who was registered by her mum. “What’s even worse is that the woman and her parents denied knowing my mum,” she told Daily Sun. Thabo Mokgola, a spokesman for Home Affairs, said: “The department will contact Thandeka to try and resolve her problem.”
