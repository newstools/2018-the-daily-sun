THEY sleep uncomfortably, waiting for the crashing noise that tells them a car has slammed into their house again! In four years, six cars have plunged into the the Leeuw family’s four-roomed house in Phahameng, Mangaung. During the latest crash on Sunday, an eight-year-old boy was injured when a wall fell on him. Theko Leeuw (49) said they were asleep at 5.15am when they heard a loud bang and saw bright lights in the bedroom. When the SunTeam arrived at the house in the kasi, builders had already started rebuilding the home. There was no electricity because the prepaid meter box had been damaged. Theko said: “I was with my nephews aged four, eight and 14 when a Volkswagen Vivo smashed into the wall. “I was shocked and scared when I saw the bright light in our bedroom. “I thought I was dead until I heard my nephews screaming. The eight-year-old was rushed to hospital with neck pain.” She said there were three male passengers in the car when the driver hit their house. “The driver blamed the brakes but looked very drunk. “This is the sixth time our house has been struck by cars since 2014. We don’t feel safe at all,” said Theko. Spokesman for the municipal power supplier Centlec, Lele Mamatu, said the family should report the matter to their office and they will assisted with a new power box. Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi confirmed the incident and said: “A 36-year-old driver was arrested and charged with drunken driving. He will appear in court soon.”
