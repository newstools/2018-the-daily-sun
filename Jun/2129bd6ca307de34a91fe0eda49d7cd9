IT SEEMS hijackers are now targeting cars belonging to VIPs. In less than two months, three top politicians have become hijacking victims. Two of the incidents happened in Gauteng while the third was in the Eastern Cape. The latest incident took place on Saturday when Gauteng Arts and Culture MEC Faith Mazibuko’s bodyguard was hijacked in the Joburg CBD. Three armed men approached the bodyguard, pointed firearms at him and demanded the car keys. Police said the thugs drove off with the bodyguard and dropped him off in Sophiatown. He was unharmed. The MEC’s Mercedes-Benz ML 500 was recovered yesterday. Two weeks ago, a similar incident took place in Midrand when Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga’s grey Mercedes-Benz CLS 250 was hijacked. He was reportedly leaving a restaurant when he was confronted by two armed men. The vehicle was later recovered. In April, Eastern Cape DA member of the provincial legislature Sanele Magaqa was hijacked by seven armed men in King William’s Town. He and two of his family members were forced out of his silver VW Polo Vivo as Magaqa was dropping off another relative at a taxi rank in Zwelitsha. The car was later found abandoned in Dumbaza. All of Magaqa’s valuables had been stolen. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed that Mazibuko’s car was recovered. He said four suspects were arrested in Eldorado Park. He said: “They were found in possession of the hijacked vehicle, a firearm believed to be the one taken from the bodyguard and another unlicensed gun. “The suspects will be charged with hijacking, kidnapping and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition.”
