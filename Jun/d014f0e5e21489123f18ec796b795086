A video of a Ford Kuga that caught fire on the N3 South at the London off-ramp near Sandton on Monday afternoon is doing the rounds on social media. It is alleged the Ford Kuga was driven by a technician who was test driving it. In the video, the white Kuga can be seen parked on the side of the road, with visible fire coming out of the engine bay. Ford South Africa had issued a recall in 2017 for a total of 4500 1.6 litre Kugas that were built between December 2012 and February 2014. “Once the current phase of the safety recall is completed, and with proper maintenance of the cooling system, the 1,6-Kuga is safe to drive.” Ford South Africa previously said. Ford South Africa said more than 63% of the affected vehicles had already been repaired and returned to their owners, who could enjoy driving with peace of mind. But they also said that a number of the affected vehicles had not yet been brought in to Ford dealers for the urgent repair at the time, which was 2017.
