WINTER fires have claimed another breadwinner. This time tragedy struck in Orlando East, Soweto, on Sunday when five shacks were eaten by a fire, the fifth incident in the kasi since the start of winter. He is the fifth person to die. Girly Buthelezi now faces an uncertain future after the flames robbed her of her beloved husband and the dad of her three kids, Elliot Khumalo. Girly said she was with Elliot early on Sunday, only to that receive news later that he had died in the fire. She was worried there was now no one to help her raise their kids. Neighbours said they were awoken by Elliot’s agonising screams, which went dead as soon as they had started. Five shacks were burnt in the blaze and everything turned to ashes. The family said Elliot’s burnt body was found on the floor. They suspect he might have tried to get out. Busisiwe Ntuthu (20) said they were in the next shack when they smelled smoke. Before they knew it, smoke was billowing into their shack through the holes. “We went out and knocked at bab’Khumalo’s door, but there was no answer,” said Busisiwe. She said the rest of the people managed to get out of their shacks before they were gutted by the fire. Their efforts to extinguish the flames with water were no match for the raging flames. The family said yesterday they were devastated by the death of Elliot, who many referred to as Mzala. People described him as a friendly person who was loved by his family and said he’d be sorely missed. EMS spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said one person died in the shack fire. Mulaudzi said five shack fires had been reported in Soweto since the beginning of this month.
