KZN supporters of President Cyril Ramaphosa scored another victory on Sunday, The Pietermaritzburg High Court barred the Moses Mabhida regional conference from sitting. Branches that support Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma were already singing and dancing at Harry Gwala Stadium, getting ready for their conference on Friday. And then, provincial leaders told them to cancel the meeting. Siyabonga Hlongwa said on Saturday the branches defied provincial leaders’ decision by going to court to ask for a special conference to sit on Sunday. He said Ramaphosa supporters then went to court and filed an urgent application on Saturday to interdict the conference. Hlongwa toldDaily Sun the matter sat on Sunday and the court ruled in their favour. “We don’t know why they were organising a conference while there’s a pending appeal,” he said. “The court struck the case off the roll because there’s still an appeal on the same matter. “If they think the conference will sit without resolving problems we raised with the national executive committee, they’re wasting their time.” Mzi Zuma – who was appointed regional co-ordinator in the interim structure after it was disbanded earlier this month – insisted that the branches met the 70% that’s required for the conference to sit. But some branches, he said, had used the courts to stop it. Two weeks ago, the Ramaphosa backers successfully challenged the provincial conference in court. As a result, it was cancelled at the last minute.
