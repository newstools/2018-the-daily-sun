Relegated Ajax Cape Town has officially parted ways with controversial striker Tendai Ndoro. Ndoro has been a subject of debate when the club went in and out of courts as they fought for dear life in an attempt to remain in the Absa Premiership. The Urban Warriors were docked points for fielding an ineligible Ndoro who had represented three sides in a single season, something the FIFA rules prohibit. That saw them fall from 15th to 16th place on the on the Absa Premiership table, thereby getting automatically relegated to the National First Division. “The Urban Warriors have officially parted ways with Tendai Ndoro,” the club said on its website. “Ndoro’s contract was up for renewal at the end of this month (June 2018); however the club have opted not to extend his stay at Ikamva. “The club would like to wish Tendai all the best in his future endeavours and thank him for his services over the past six months.”
