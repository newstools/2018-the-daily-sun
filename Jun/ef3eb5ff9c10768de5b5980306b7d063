WHEN Joel Rahube died at his sister’s home last week after being sick for a year, she took his body to the mortuary. She is now accusing his children of stealing the body and burying it without her knowledge. Joel’s sister Annah Modiselle said she was devastated. The 68-year-old from Mmakau, North West, told Daily Sun her family was preparing for Joel’s funeral when the incident happened. She said after Joel died, she informed his kids, but none of them came to her. So she decided to take the body to the mortuary. “The next day his children came and asked for his ID,” she said. “They told me they were going to use it at the police station. “I was shocked when the people at the mortuary called me and said my brother’s body was missing.” When gogo Annah went to investigate, a mortuary worker told her Joel’s son had taken the body. “I called the children to find out what was going on and they said they were going to bury their father.” Annah said Joel and the children’s mum separated many years ago and they never took care of him. Joel’s niece Onica Modiselle (52) said they went to the police and were told to get a court interdict. “But when we got to court, we were told to get a lawyer,” said Onica. “We were later ordered to pay R2 100 to Joel’s son for the costs of moving the body.” When the SunTeam contacted Joel’s son Sello, he said: “They took care of my father when he was alive, but he was my dad.”
