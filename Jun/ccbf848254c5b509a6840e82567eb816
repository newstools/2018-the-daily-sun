NINE youths from Slovo in Mabopane, Tshwane, are taking a stand against the abuse of women and children. They marched from their kasi to Winterveld on Saturday. Phindile Maimela (26), the leader of the march, said many women and children have been killed in the area. She said: “We’re tired of burying them every weekend. “We don’t know who’s going to be next. It might be a neighbour or a relative.” Phindile said she used to be in an abusive relationship. “My ex-boyfriend used to abuse me, but I managed to get out of the toxic relationship. “I know some women stay in bad relationships because they hope things will change. Some want to leave but it’s not easy.” Lebogang Melato (12), one of the kids who took part in the march, said abuse was a big problem. “We’re tired of it,” she said. Dineo Molautsi (11) said the problem lies with men.
