BETHA Chikanga has emerged as a serious threat to Glenrose Xaba and Kesa Molotsane in the Spar Women's Grand Prix series. Like a thunderbolt, Chikanga came from nowhere to claim the Durban leg of the Spar series yesterday. The Zimbabwean forced herself into the reckoning with an astonishing performance when she led the race from start, dominated and finished with the time of 33. 07 sec. However, it was Xaba who moved to the top of the Grand Prix standings on points, despite finishing second. Even though the Boxer Athletics runner dislodged Molotsane from the top, the day belonged to Chikanga. "Everything went according to our plan as a team and I'm glad I won," said Chikanga. "I opened a good gap and I was comfortable as the race went on. I've done 21 kilometres before and so I knew how to plan for the 10kms. "It's my first win of the series, the mostÂ  important. I'll obviously be going for more wins in the next three races." The 21-year-old Chikanga finished first ahead of Xaba (33.27) and KPMG athlete Nolene Conrad (33.43). Molotsane came sixth with the time of 34.15 but is still very much in contention with three more races to go.
