FIVE kids are without a mum after shoddy health care and
her drunk husband allegedly led to her tragic death. According to Punch,
Nkechi Okonya (32) died at Bwari General Hospital north of Abuja, Nigeria, on
20 April after undergoing a C-section. The inquiry into her death, which was carried out on
Tuesday, pinned part of the blame for her death on the clinic Nkechi initially
went to when she started her labour. Here she gave birth to her first child, but when it
became clear the two remaining babies were stuck, she was taken to Bwari
General Hospital. It took four hours for her to be transported there, even
though it is only a few blocks away. By this stage she had lost a lot of blood and was weak.
Her two remaining babies were delivered at the hospital by C-section. Osayande Osagie, Medical Director at Bwari General
Hospital, had very harsh words for Nkechi’s husband. “Throughout this time, the
husband was drunk; we could not obtain any information from him. We could not
get him to donate blood. Up till the next morning, the husband was still
drunk.” He added: “We knew the case was bad immediately they
brought her in; twins are a high risk pregnancy, and we are now talking of
triplets.” Although Nkechi was given three units of blood, she
continued to bleed and died later that night. Family members later came to fetch her triplets, all of
whom survived. Nkechi also had two older kids who are also in their care. Osagie said the family did not demand financial
compensation for Nkechi’s death, but pointed out that they also dodged paying
the hospital bill. The family declined to comment to Punch.
