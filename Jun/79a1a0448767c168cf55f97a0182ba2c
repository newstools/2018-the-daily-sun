KHAMA Billiat may be facing an uncertain club future but he sure knows where his national allegiance lies. The Zimbabwean remains in limbo as his contract with Mamelodi Sundowns expires this month, making him a free agent able to seek employment elsewhere. It is unclear whether or the nippy winger will stay at Chloorkop or head overseas in the coming weeks. But seemingly none of that mattered as Billiat scored a brace to help Zimbabwe lift the 2018 Cosafa Cup with a 4-2 victory over Zambia at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. Billiat provided the decisive assist for Philana Kadewere to score the leveller before the Sundowns star netted twice in extra time to guide the Warriors to their record sixth Cosafa championship. However, in a social media post the 28-year-old appeared to take a thinly disguised swipe at the Brazilians. “Thank God for the grace,” Billiat said on social media. “Let me tell you this for once, I’m not given this talent from anyone I have breakfast with. I couldn’t give this respect to my own parents which I regret. Thank you for everything.” He also seemed to be bidding the PSL champions goodbye, fuelling speculation that he is on his way out. This is despite efforts from the club to persuade him to extend his five-year stay. “Remember, I was blessed also before you met me and I have so many calls recorded, reply to this and just post the recordings, I had so much (sic) trust issues. As much as you respect me, I prepared good news for you cz (sic) you are not Jesus. “I don’t care because you are not the last place that makes things happen.”
