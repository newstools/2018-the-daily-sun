When you’re the queen, one birthday party is just not enough. Not only did Bonang have a massive celebration at Joburg hotspot Taboo on Saturday for her 31st birthday, the star also gathered her family in her own back yard on Sunday for a feast that was fit for a queen. Decorated by Precious the Planner, the same woman in charge of the star’s 30th birthday extravaganza in 2017, the theme for the event was pink with touches of gold.
