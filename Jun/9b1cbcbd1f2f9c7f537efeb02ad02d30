VILLAGERS in Phatsima have had a fire station for seven years but no one works there! Residents of the village outside Rustenburg, North West saidthey have been complaining about the situation for years. Community member Mpho Molebatsi (36) said thugs had broken into the building and stolen equipment and furniture. “We had hoped the fire station would help reduce the unemployment rate in the village. “Many young people went and took fire rescue courses when they heard the station would open.” She said the station was a prime example of how government funds were wasted as the station had to be fixed now in order to operate. Rustenburg municipal spokesman Andrew Seome said: “As part of the municipality’s role in providing public safety services, two fire stations were constructed in Marikana and Phatsima.” Seome said the municipality was in the process of getting a fire truck for the station in Phatsima. “A fire rescue training academy was accredited in April and the intention is to ensure the fire stations are operational in the 2018/2019 financial year.”
