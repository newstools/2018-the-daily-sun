MPUMALANGA cops have called on the Siyabuswa community to
report those that were involved in torching two schools. The Siyathokoza Senior Secondary School and the Thabana
Senior Phase School, were torched on Saturday allegedly by community who were dissatisfied
with issues surrounding recent by-elections held in the area. "On Monday a number of learners will not have access to
classes thereby causing a disturbance to their academic program and their
future. A society that does not take care of its children is a doomed
society," Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Mondli Â Zuma said. He called on the community to avoid destroying property
whenever they are disappointed with something. Zuma pleaded with members of the community to refrain from
violence, the destruction of property and infrastructure, let alone schools
whenever having a dissatisfaction or complaint. Department of Basic Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga
said together with the MEC of Mpumalanga Education they visited the two schools
that were set alight on Friday night. Mhlanga further said Motshekga has called for harsh sentences
for people who destroy school infrastructure. Police have opened cases of arson for investigation and are
appealing to anyone who may be able to assist police in their investigation to
contact Detective Colonel Kgobeng Magakwe 082 302 6621 or the SAPS Crime Stop
number, 08600 10111.
