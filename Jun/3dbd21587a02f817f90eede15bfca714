Three people were killed and a woman is in a critical
condition after a bakkie rolled on Zigzag road in Springs on Saturday night. At approximately 23:00, ER24 paramedics arrived at the
scene and found all four patients entrapped in the bakkie. "It took fire and rescue personnel about an hour to
extricate the woman from the bakkie. "She was in a critical condition and was immediately
transported to a nearby hospital for further medical care. "Paramedics saw that there was nothing they could do
to save the driver of the bakkie and two more passengers. The three men were
declared dead on the scene," said ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring. Meiring said details surrounding this incident are not
yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
