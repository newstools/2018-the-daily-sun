THE family of a mentally disturbed boy who went missing two weeks ago is desperately looking for him. Nomusa Mchunu (43) of Verulam in KZN said her son Thobani (19) lost his mind shortly before he went missing. She said this could have been a sign from the ancestors. Thobani went missing after visiting his father’s home in Amatikwe on 24 May and had previously been in a mental institution. “After he went missing, we realised this could be a sign for us to perform a ritual,” she said. “We’ve been talking about it for many years but never did it.” Nomusa said Thobani had said he wanted a goat to be slaughtered and his surname changed. “We’re praying that we find him soon so we can do the ritual before this affects his younger siblings,” she said. “We’re worried because his problems forced him to leave school.” The worried mum appealed to SunReaders who may have seen her son to contact their nearest cop shop. KZN Traditional Healers Association chairman Thandonjani Hlongwane said: “Things like this can happen when the ancestors demand certain things be done the right way.” Hlongwane said he hoped they found him alive because when the ancestors want a particular ritual to be performed, they don’t give warnings that are not deadly. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a missing person’s docket was opened at Inanda Police Station for investigation. “We appeal to anyone with information to contact cops on 031 510 9900/8 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
