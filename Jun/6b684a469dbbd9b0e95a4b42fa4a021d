COMMUTERS from north of Tshwane were left stranded between train stations yesterday morning barely three weeks after the Pretoria-Pienaarspoort line train service was reintroduced. The cause of the train coming to a sudden halt was a damaged overhead wire cable at Pienaarspoort Station in Mamelodi East. The fuming commuters were forced to foot it from there to the next station at Mamelodi Gardens. From there they further had to walk long distance or else find alternative transport. Ezra Ngwenya (57) said that travelling by train was proving unreliable. He said he wasn’t too surprised to find a stillstanding train in Pienaarspoort because trains hardly operated smoothly for a full month. Another commuter, Enoch Kumalo (38) said they were used to suffering disappointments as they walked long distances to reach the station only to find that the train wouldn’t come. “This might be the cheapest transport we have but we expect it to be reliable,” he said. Gauteng Metrorail spokeswoman, Lillian Mofokeng, said trains hadn’t been running yesterday due to the overhead wire damage at Pienaarspoort Station. “Only Pienaarspoort Station was affected. Buses were used to shuttle commuters between Pienaarspoort and Mamelodi Gardens,” she said. Mofokeng said technicians managed to restore the line and services were back to normal. Prasa’s acting group CEO, Lindikaya Zide, official announced the reintroduction of Pretoria-Pienaarspoort line train service at the beginning of May.
