Police in Marble Hall in outside Groblersdal were shocked to
find a 4-month-old baby playing near two dead people, believed to be his
parents. The shocking discovery was made in Uyskraal near the N11 Road
, between Marble Hall and Roedan. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said cops found  the body of a 22-year-old woman with bruises
around her neck and the body of a 37-year-old man hanged in a tree. The baby boy, believed to be the child of either one of or
both of deceased, was found next to them playing. Ngoepe said it is alleged that a passerby noticed the body
of a person hanging in a tree and noticed the police who then reacted swiftly. He said the child is in good condition and he was taken to a
safe place. The motive behind this incident is still unknown but
domestic violence could not be ruled out. The identities of both deceased will be announced as soon as
their next of kin are informed. Ngoepe said cops condemn with the most strongest terms the
continuous incidents of domestic violence which sometimes lead to the loss of
lives or injuries. “Members of the community are still advised and encouraged
that in case of any domestic related situation, they must consult their relevant
local professionals for intervention rather than harming or taking the life of
another,” said Ngoepe.
