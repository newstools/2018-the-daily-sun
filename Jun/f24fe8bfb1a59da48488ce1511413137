MAKHADO Municipality is ready to pump a further R15 million into the road project at Mashao and Valdezia villages. But there’s just one problem. The 2km of the road completed in November already needed fixing – not once, but twice! Yesterday, the municipality was reported to the Public Protector by the Democratic Alliance. It accused the council of paying the contractor over R2 million for shoddy work. Makhado is one of the 10 municipalities in Limpopo that lost vast amounts of money meant for service delivery through investing in VBS Mutual Bank. The loss of money angered the ANC’s Provincial Executive Council. VBS Mutual Bank is currently under curatorship after going bankrupt. Glenda Furumele, the DA councillor in the municipality who reported the matter to the Public Protector, said the misuse of public funds had to come to an end. “How are we going to inject public funds of about R15 million into the same road that was a failure from the beginning? “The road was opened in November but has been repaired twice this year. The contractor was paid for such shoddy work. We want the municipality to account for this because it is clear that the engineers who were on site approved something that was not on point. No one from the municipality’s management is willing to give us answers,” she said. Makhado spokesman Louis Bobodi said the matter was taken to the municipal principals for investigation. He said they would only be able to report back once they had a full grasp of the allegations.
