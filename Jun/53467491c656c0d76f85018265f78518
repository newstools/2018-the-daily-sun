FREE State Stars have signed former AmaZulu forward Linda Bhengu. The 21-year-old is set to play his first season in the top flight after spending three years in the National First Division (NFD). The news were confirmed by the player’s manager Sizwe Ntshangase, who said Bhengu was over the moon. The striker spent last season with now-relegated Mthatha Bucks in the NFD. Said Ntshangase:”The boy is delighted at the prospect of playing in the top flight. He’s still young and Stars know how to groom young talent. He will grow and become a better player.” Bhengu is the younger brother of national Under-23 striker Phumelele Bhengu, who made his name at Moroka Swallows. Ntshangase thanked Linda’s father, Zwelikude Bhengu, who played a huge role in making sure the youngster signed for Ea Lla Koto. “I’m not at liberty to discuss the state of his contract. All I can say is he signed a long-term contract. Only Free State Stars can state the duration of the contract. “I want to thank his father, who was instrumental in making sure the deal went through. His blessing and advice helped,” added Ntshangase. Stars general manager Rantsi Mokoena would not confirm or deny the news: “We will announce player signings in due course. Right now I can’t comment on that.”
