THE open field next to KwaFaku Primary in Lower Crossroads is covered in water. Makhosonke Njibana (28) said they don’t know what to do now because they used to play soccer there. “We haven’t been playing lately because of this situation and we don’t know what to do.” Makhosonke said playing soccer kept young people away from crime. “Now that we don’t have a place to play, some of us will be tempted to use our free time for negative things.” A resident, Sandla Mashiya (45), said it was the first time they had seen the field flooded. “We are happy because we have been without water for quite some time. “But I just feel sorry for those who used this field to play soccer. Hopefully the city will help them and pump the water out,” said Sandla. Likhona Thangani (16) said all he wanted to do was to train so he can play for Mzansi’s national team one day. “I know that in order for someone to go far they must start somewhere but we can’t do that without practising,” he said. Likhona said he and his friends would be grateful if the water was drained. Cape Town Councillor Eddie Andrews said the field was actually the Ngqwangi Drive pond. He said the first pond was a detention pond which holds water for a while and is normally dry during the summer months. He said the second one was a retention pond which is also known as a wet pond because it retains water throughout the year. “These two ponds are divided by a concrete weir. “If the water in the detention pond reaches a certain height, it overflows the retention pond and drains out at an outlet on the southern corner of the pond.” He said the ponds were designed for a reason and each served a particular function within the storm water system. “For this reason the ponds unfortunately cannot be pumped dry as this would defeat the purpose of the structures,” said Andrews.
