Thomas Mangena’s family want to rebury him so that he can rest in peace. Thomas’ mutilated body was found lying 500m from his grave in Masoma Village, outside Tzaneen in Limpopo, last Tuesday. He was buried in April after dying at the age of 50. His family believe his soul has not been at peace since his grave was violated. Family member Corny Mangena (34) said the body was being kept at a government mortuary. “His children had DNA tests done by forensic pathologists yesterday but understand it is just a formality as we are sure it is him. “The body was still wearing the clothes we dressed it in for his funeral,” said Corny. “We will not be doing a formal funeral ceremony again, but the whole family will gather at his house and hold a short service to say farewell. “We are still traumatised by the incident because we were still healing from his death when this happened,” said Corny. The remains were discovered by a passerby who alerted villagers and police. The teeth, legs, hands and tongue were missing. Corny said: “Our suspicion is that the suspects could be among us in the village. “We have people who come to the bushes here to dig herbs to sell to traditional healers.” Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said no arrests had been made but an investigative team led by Colonel Cecil Machimana was hunting the suspects. “We are pleading with local residents to assist the police with information that could lead to arrests. “They can call Colonel Machimana on 082 451 7181,” he said.
