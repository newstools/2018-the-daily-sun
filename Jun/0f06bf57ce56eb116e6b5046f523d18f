MANDLA Xulu refuses to let police fight crime alone. The 45-year-old from Cato Manor, near Durban is the chairman of the community policing forum in his kasi. He said he started out as an ordinary member in 1996 and was appointed chairman in 2013. According to Xulu, Cato Manor is plagued by housebreaking, murder and drug abuse. He said he chose to fight crime because he wanted his neighbours to live in a safe environment. “But my job comes with challenges,” he said. “Some think I’m a spy while others commend me for keeping them safe.” Xulu said his job is to report crime to the cops, help them make arrests and attend meetings that aim to find ways of nabbing tsotsis. “Sometimes residents wake me up at night and ask me to contact the police. “I think some of them don’t understand what my duties are. “A few of them have asked me to call ambulances or the councillor for them. “But I enjoy that because I am a helpful person.” He said in 2016 KZN Premier Willies Mchunu, who was the minister of community safety at the time, gave him an excellence award. Xulu said he formed Ikhona Lamadoda men’s organisation last year. The organisation is a platform for men to discuss their problems and offer advice on how to take care of their families. Councillor Mkhipheni Ngiba said Xulu is doing a great job. “That man hates crime with all his heart. Most of the residents go to him before reporting a matter to the police,” said Ngiba.
