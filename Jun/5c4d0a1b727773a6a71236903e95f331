A BLACK plastic bag usually used in dustbins was found in the morning at the gate of Rethabile Day Care Centre. But the bag was not filled with rubbish. Residents were instead horrified when a baby girl was found dumped in it. News of the shocking discovery spread like wildfire through Zone 16 Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, yesterday. The baby girl was discovered next to the day care centre’s gate by a passerby. Cop spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi said the baby was estimated to be between six and eight months of age. “Residents told us they did not know who the baby belonged to.” Nkoadi said the little girl was taken to a nearby clinic. “She will be handed over to social workers, who will take the matter further.” He said a case of child abandonment was opened. “No one has been arrested yet but we are still investigating the matter,” he said. Nkoadi pleaded with the residents to help the police with information. “If anyone knows who the mother is, please come forward with information.” Mbangwa Xaba, spokesman for the department of social development, confirmed the incident. “If you feel you cannot look after your baby, contact social development,” he said. Xaba said mothers should know that child abandonment was a criminal offence. “Residents should refrain from judging mothers, but rather share information on alternative care,” he said.
