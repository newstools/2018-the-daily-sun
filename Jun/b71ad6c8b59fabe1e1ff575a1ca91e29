THESE sworn enemies were once best friends. Thabisile Tsekeletsa (49) told Daily Sun her neighbour Zanele Sibisi (40) stole her husband Thabo (55). Thabisile from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, said she did everything for her friend, who wasn’t working. “I didn’t know she was going to stab me in the back. I’m out in the cold with my two kids while she’s enjoying herself.” Thabisile claimed Thabo didn’t support her kids and blamed his new lover. “Zanele used to admire how my husband used to spoil me, but I never thought she wanted him for herself,” she said. Thabisile said they had been married for years when Zanele came between them. “When people told me they saw them together, I dismissed it as a rumour. I trusted her.” She was shattered when a friend showed her a video of them together, but when she confronted them they said they weren’t having an affair. She said the two then moved in together. “She’s pregnant with my husband’s child and controls his money.” Zanele confirmed that she was pregnant. “I just want to show Thabisile how to treat a man,” she said. She denied preventing Thabo from maintaining his kids. Thabo said he supports his eldest daughter but doesn’t have an account number for his other child. He said Thabisile was bitter. “Where was she when I moved in with Zanele?” he said.
