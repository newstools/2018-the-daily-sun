POWER utility Eskom says
power supply is limited as a result of industrial action. This as the National Union of
Mineworkers (NUM) and National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) members
wants a 15% increase across the board, a housing
allowance increase of R2 000. Eskom said the generation and distribution of electricity across Eskom’s
network is constrained today due to the acts of sabotage and intimidation. In its update the power
utility said there have been several incidents of road blockades, attacks on
staff, and wilful damage of electricity infrastructure. “As a result, all road coal
deliveries have been stopped for security reasons. The safety of all our
employees is of paramount importance to us during this time.” The power stations that are
worst-affected by the industrial action are Hendrina, Camden, Kendal, and
Arnot, which are all located in Mpumalanga. “We appreciate and thank our
employees who continue to work hard to keep the lights on.” At a media briefing on
Wednesday, Eskom Chief Executive Officer Phakamani Hadebe said the power
utility has activated contingency measures to mitigate against the industrial
action.
