DR MATHABO Mathebula, the acting CEO of Steve Biko Hospital, said the facility is not collapsing. He was addressing the media yesterday during a Human Rights Commission visit to the hospital in Tshwane. The inspection came after the media reported that the hospital’s cancer ward was on the verge of collapse. It was alleged that machines were broken, the ward was understaffed and 934 patients were awaiting radiation treatment. While taking the commission and members of the media on a walk around the facility, Mathebula said the allegations were totally untrue. Assistant director of radiation oncology, Prevania Pillay, said last year two machines were shut down for two months because the air-conditioner was broken. “We used to have a six-month waiting list but now we have three-and-a-half months,” she said. Pillay said they fixed the air-conditioner and the machines were functioning. The commission’s Buang Jones said they would write down their observations and the investigation would be completed in 180 days. Jones said they were satisfied with what they had observed. During the walkabout, some patients complained about the long hours they had to wait to receive treatment. They said the ward didn’t have enough doctors and something should be done about it. One patient complained about being at the hospital since 5am and not being attended to by midday.
