SEVEN cash-in-transit heist suspects who were arrested in connection with a heist on Matlala road in Limpopo have been denied bail by the Seshego Magistrate's Court. The suspects were arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation Unit and supported by the Provincial Task Team and Crime Intelligence and Tactical Response. HAWKS spokesperson Matimba  Maluleke said the suspects ambushed a cash van on the Matlala road, just outside Polokwane and made off with an undisclosed amount of money. He said a manhunt ensued straight away and seven suspects aged between 24 and 49 were arrested in different parts of the province. During the operation cops recovered two stolen vehicles with false registration plates, ammunition, cartridges, money bags and explosives. Maluleke said the suspects will appear in court again on the 15th of August.
