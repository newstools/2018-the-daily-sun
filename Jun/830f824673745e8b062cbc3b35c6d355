ON WEDNESDAY a motorist cheated death on the Mabopane Highway. Fifty-year-old Benzi Tenza’s blue Mini Cooper seemingly stopped working while he was driving. Seconds later, it burst into flames! A shocked Benzi from Boksburg told Daily Sun he was on his way to a meeting in Soshanguve, Tshwane. He told of his shock when, while driving it, out of nowhere his car began to act up. “I couldn’t control it any more. “The windscreen wipers and lights began to switch on by themselves and the pedals refused to work. “When I tried to stop the car, the brakes refused to work. “Before I knew it, I saw smoke coming from my dashboard.” Benzi said once he saw the smoke, he immediately removed his seat belt before it could lock. He had to think fast because he saw the car was about to go up in flames. “I struggled with it until I managed to stop it. I was also scared about the cars behind me but fortunately, managed to get it off the road,” he said. People came to his rescue and helped him to get his stuff out of the car. One of them told the People’s Paper he was driving behind Benzi when he saw the car swerving over the road. “I thought the car was going to overturn, but miraculously it stopped. “I knew something bad was going to happen when I saw the smoke.” He said he believes only God could have saved Benzi. “The hand of God was on him because the car could have exploded with him inside,” he said. Benzi said he was grateful to be alive, but watching his beloved car burn in front of his eyes was painful. “I know what matters the most is life, but never in my entire life would I have thought I’d find myself in this position. I loved my car,” he said.
