SPIRITS were high when Mangaung mayor Olly Mlamleli welcomed back 16 soldiers following their return from official deployment. The welcoming ceremony was held on Saturday at Mangaung Outdoor Sports Centre in Rocklands, Bloemfontein. The soldiers of No 1 South African Mechanised Infantry Battalion were working at the border between South Africa and Lesotho from September until March. South African Army Infantry Formation Brigadier-General Bhasi Gqoboka said: “As the chief of staff, I am honoured to welcome back home the battalion from deployment. “Being a soldier is not about serving and protecting, it is about giving back to the country and communities. That is why I take pleasure congratulating 1 South African Infantry Battalion on a job well done. “This is your special day to remember.” Mlamleli said: “It is a great honour once again to stand before these men and women in uniform to welcome them back home after completing their successful six-month tour of duty. They were safeguarding the border between Lesotho and South Africa from September to March 2018. “These operations are being undertaken to prevent illegal activities along our international borders. Gqoboka went on to thank recipients of long service medals, who were also attending the event. “Today we are here to award 20-year long-service medals as well as the Mandela bronze medals,” he said. “Medals show us growth in a member. They narrate a story lived, challenges faced and successes achieved. To those who have reached 20 years, we can learn from you and be encouraged by your dedication.”
