THE clan name Madiba stirs up emotions and reminds all in Mzansi of our first great statesman. But to Joseph Mthethwa (49) the name has been both a blessing and an irritation. Strangers have been calling him “Madiba” since he was in his 20s – all because he looks a lot like Nelson Mandela. His answer to curious people is always: “We might look alike, but we are not related.” Joseph said he had tried many times to explain to people that there was no relation, but it always fell on deaf ears. Even when he is at work, clients whom he helps always want to take pictures of or with him. The man from Braamfischerville in Soweto said people started calling him Madiba during his younger days. “When I looked in the mirror, I saw that I do look a bit like him,” he said. Joseph’s colleagues call him Madiba. “Even my wife once told me that I should go to the Mandelas to ask whether we might be related. “I didn’t do that because I am a Mthethwa and there is no doubt about that.” His colleague, Handsome Moyo, told Daily Sun: “Just like many other people, I also thought Joseph and Madiba were related.”
