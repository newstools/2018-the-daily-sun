TWO trucks were torched yesterday by residents protesting over service delivery. Residents of Mfekayi Village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, blocked the N2 highway. They demanded houses and running water. Truck driver Dumisani Zondi (48) was stuck in traffic for three hours while cops dispersed protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets. He said trucks were set alight and looted. Qiniso Hlatshwayo (25) said they were tired of waiting in vain for services and decided to block the main road. He said they wanted Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala to address them. “We’ve been complaining for a long time that we want houses, water, clinics and electricity. We won’t move until Zikalala comes here to speak to us,” he said. Mayor Velenkosini Gumede said he left a meeting to speak to the protesters, but they wanted to see Zikalala. “It’s true that there aren’t houses and many other things in Mfekayi, but it’s not the local municipality’s problem,” he said. Gumede said this was the provincial government’s responsibility. “I called Zikalala because he was the one appointed by Premier Willies Mchunu to be the service delivery champion in our district.” Zikalala’s spokesman Bongani Tembe said: “The MEC has noted the request and it will be processed.” He said the MEC was committed to working closely with residents.
