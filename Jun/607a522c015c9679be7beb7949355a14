MANY people see death as the end of the road. But 63-year-old Gamelihle Dlungwana didn’t allow it to stand in his way. The madala from Gunjini Village in Osindisweni, KZN, gave his wife Sindisiwe Khuzwayo (63) a cheerful wedding ceremony on Sunday. They didn’t walk down the aisle because she was in a coffin . . . Gamelihle told Daily Sun he was honouring a promise he made to his wife years ago. “About 20 years ago, we got married in court,” he said. “We didn’t do umabo, where the bride gives gifts to the family of her husband and my wife had always been worried about that.” He said earlier this year, they started buying gifts and cows for the big day, but she died from diabetes last Sunday. “I then decided to have the wedding on the day of her funeral, because I wanted to put a ring on her finger,” he said. The madala said his wife may have known she was going to die because in April she asked her sister Ntokozo to do the traditional dance on her behalf. “I thought she was saying this because her leg was amputated last year, but now I see why.” Ntokozo (60) told Daily Sun on Saturday the coffin passed the home of their parents before being taken to the Dlungwana home. “They loved each other and that’s why we supported my brother-in-law when he told us he wanted to do this,” she said. The couple had three kids but two of them died years ago.
