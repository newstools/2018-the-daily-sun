SEVEN cash in transit robbery suspects abandoned their bail application yesterday. The suspects were appearing in the Seshego Magistrates Court in Polokwane, Limpopo, for the second time following their arrest two weeks ago. They were arrested at a house in Seshego extension 73 after an SBV cash van was robbed on Matlala Road in Polokwane last month. They were found in possession of two stolen cars with fake number plates, ammunition, cartridges, money bags and explosives. Their defence team told the court the suspects’ rights were violated when cops circulated their photos from their identity parade on social media. Magistrate Mikateko Maboko said no court order was given against an identity parade and she couldn’t rule on things that appeared on social media. “We haven’t received any court order against the parade,” said Maboko. “We don’t even know what the parade is about. That will be for the trial court.” “This is not the social media court. What we want is to understand that all the accused are legally represented so we can proceed with the bail application.” Defence lawyer Pholoto Seopela said his clients had informed him in the morning they were not continuing with their bail application. “We can’t divulge their reasons for abandoning bail and that applies to all the accused,” he said. NPA spokeswoman Mashudu Malabi-Dzangi said they were ready to proceed when the defence decided to postpone. “We’re ready. We’re optimistic that we have evidence to proceed with the case,” she said. The case was postponed to 15 August for investigation.
