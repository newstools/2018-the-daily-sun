PUPILS of Injongo Primary School in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, will take part in the provincial leg of the Youth Citizen Action Programme. “Each school had to choose something to teach people. “I suggested we talk about the importance of education, but the pupils came up with a different idea,” said teacher Ntsikelelo Kamteni. The pupils said they wanted to talk about teenage pregnancy because they have seen how it affects young people. Kamteni said having honest discussions with the youth will cause a decrease in teenage pregnancy. “Some parents aren’t comfortable talking about these things with their kids. “We want them to feel free to share their knowledge about the matter,” said Kamteni. Injongo competed against five high schools and seven primary schools. “Our pupils are looking forward to the provincial and national legs of the competition. “I trust my pupils and know they will do well,” she said. Pupil Aviwe Thobi (13) said they wanted to help as many young people as possible. “We want girls to know that they don’t have to sleep with boys to prove that they love them,” said Aviwe. He said true love is patient. “If someone loves you, he will wait for you. “Don’t try to please people by doing something you are not ready for,” he said. Simosihle Twasile (12) said many teenagers do not know the consequences of falling pregnant. “Girls, let’s love ourselves and put our education first. “The rest will follow. “We have a lot of time to do grown-up things. “Our future must come first,” said Simosihle. The Youth Citizen Action Programme empowers young people to become the next generation of leaders. The programme create positive role models for pupils. Certificates are handed out at district, provincial and national level.
