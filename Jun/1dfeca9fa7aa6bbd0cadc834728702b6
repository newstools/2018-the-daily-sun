SA BOXING governing body Boxing South Africa (BSA) will embark on anti-doping workshops to promote clean sport and educate its stakeholders. This informative outreach programme will be launched in the Eastern Cape on 23-24 June and is expected to be expanded to other provinces. First up will be workshops at Mdantsane’s Sun Hotel and at Govan Mbeki Sports Centre in Port Elizabeth the next day (24 June). BSA has partnered with the South African Institute for Drug Free (Saids) to highlight the negative impact doping has on boxing. The governing body has suffered several blows below the belt due to doping cases in recent times, with some of its licensees being found guilty by Saids of using banned performance enhancing substances. More than 10 SA fighters have been found guilty of doping by the institute in recent months. BSA’s Chief Operations Officer Cindi Nkomo said anti-doping in sport was not new. The aim is to educate and empower licensees. “It is critical for them to have knowledge and a good understanding of anti-doping and the role of Saids. Although only boxers are tested we are including trainers and managers because they are the people closest to the fighters,” she said. “These workshops will ensure that our licensees have the information they need so that they can abide by anti-doping rules and regulations,” added Nkomo. Among pugilists caught out by the anti-doping agency are former International Boxing Federation Youth super featherweight title holder Aphiwe Mboyiya, reigning SA heavyweight champion Ruann “Giant King” Visser and national middleweight champion Barend van Rooyen. Mboyiya was banned for two years after his urine sample tested by Saids contained the banned substances furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide last year. Meanwhile, Visser is waiting for a disciplinary hearing and Van Rooyen has appealed.
