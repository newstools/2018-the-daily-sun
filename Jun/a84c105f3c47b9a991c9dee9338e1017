COPS have warned the public not to share personal information with strangers. This comes after two people opened cases at Pinetown cop shop in eThekwini, saying money was stolen from their bank accounts. Mpilonhle Khoza (21), a victim from KwaNdengezi, said he lost R2 500 after someone, who claimed to be from his cellphone service provider, phoned him to say he needed to do a sim swap as someone else was using his number. “I dropped the call but he left six missed calls. Later, my cellphone stopped working. “On Sunday, I went to withdraw cash at an ATM but there was no money in my account,” said Mpilonhle. He told Daily Sun when he went to the bank on Monday, he was told his money had been transferred to another account. Hlanganani Zuma (47) from Ntshongweni said R3 500 went missing from his account last month. “I got a loan from the bank and four days later, I got a call from a man saying he was from the bank. He asked if I had received the loan and asked me to give him four numbers I would need for another loan,” he said. Hlanganani said a few hours later, he realised his cellphone was not picking up network. “I took it to the cellphone repair store and when I went to draw money at the ATM, there was nothing in my account,” he said. When he went to the bank, he was told the money was transferred to another account. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed two cases of fraud were opened. He asked anyone with information to contact Sergeant Babalwa Mqedlana on 072 193 8718 or 079 500 0402.
