THE Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD)
says it won’t be intimidated by taxi associations. This comes after thousands of commuters were left
stranded on Monday morning, as the Alexandra Taxi Association embarked on a
one-day shut down. The association said they want to draw the attention to the
Minister of Transport about the ill-treatment of the taxi industry by the
government. “It is also crucial to note that legal compliances by
motorists and their vehicles are in line with legislation such as the National Road
Traffic Act are compulsory and enforcement is not selective, but applies across
the board,” Councillor and MMC for Public Safety in the City of Johannesburg Michael
Sun said. Sun said one part of the multi-focused operation is to
ensure road safety and to restore law and order. “Over 500 un-roadworthy, unlicensed and illegal mini bus
taxis, and over 60 illegal dumper trucks have been impounded by the JMPD since
the commencement of Operation Buya Mthetho,” Sun said. According to Sun, the city will not surrender to
lawlessness. “Illegal, non-compliant and irresponsible operators cannot
expect us to look away whilst they play with the lives of commuters” “We will certainly not be bullied into submission by the
indivisuals who promote lawless conduct and behaviour,” Sun said.
