STATIONARY goods trains have become easy targets for thugs. This follows another incident on Wednesday at about 3am on the Glenroy Farm side of the railway line outside Heidelberg, south of Joburg. Cops are looking for thugs who shot and injured a security guard. Heidelberg police spokesman Captain Thivhulawi Tshilate said security guards were patrolling the area and monitoring the stationary goods train when they heard gunshots from the side of the train as they drove past. The guard sped for cover but when the second patrol car was passing by, a suspect fired another shot and hit the driver in his lower right leg. Tshilate said the guard sustained a serious wound and was taken to Union Hospital for medical treatment. “Police arrived and found three empty 9mm bullet cartridges as well as 14 boxes that were taken out of the train container. The boxes contained gift sets, clothes hangers and toys. Police are appealing to anyone with information to report to the nearest police station, or on the SAPS CrimeStop line at 08600 10111, or to SMS Crime Line at 32211.” The incident followed another shoot- out on the same railway line last Tuesday. Another incident took place in Spaarwater in March. All the suspects are still at large.
