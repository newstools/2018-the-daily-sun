FORMER Bafana Bafana midfielder Eric Tinkler will now take a coaching job if the offer is good enough. The 47-year-old has been without a job since he resigned as head coach of SuperSport United in March after the team struggled to get results. Since then Tinkler, who guided the three-times Absa Premiership champions to the Caf Confederation Cup final where they lost 2-1 on aggregate to DR Congo giants TP Mazembe last year, has taken a break from football. Tinkler won the MTN8 cup with Matsatsantsa a Pitori last season. The former Orlando Pirates head coach also won the Telkom Knockout when he coached Cape Town City FC in the 2016-17 season. The Citizens even finished in an impressive second spot under the Roodepoort-born mentor in their first season in the top flight. “I am still enjoying my break but I am ready to coach again,” said the former Bucs and Citizens coach. “If the offer is good I will take it. But for now I am just relaxing.” Tinkler also dismissed reports linking him with the Kaizer Chiefs coaching job. The Soweto giants are looking for a head coach to replace Steve Komphela, who parted ways with the club with only three games left to play last season. Chiefs appointed former defender Patrick Mabedi as interim coach. “I don’t know anything about Chiefs and I have not had any contact with them,” said Tinkler. “In fact, no club has contacted me yet but I will listen to offers.”
