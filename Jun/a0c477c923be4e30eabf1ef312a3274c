SHE IS angry because she is in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. But that will not stop her from fighting back! SHE SAID: " I am Mokgadi Caster Semenya , I am a woman and I am fast!" The two-time Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya is challenging a recently introduced International Association of Athletics Federations regulation, slamming it as discriminatory. According to the New York Times website, Semenya was due to file a legal case before the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland, in an attempt to block the much-debated rule, which seeks to limit the permitted testosterone levels in female athletes competing in races from 400m to one mile. Semenya (27) called the rule, which is scheduled to go into effect in November 2018, medically unnecessary. “It is discriminatory, irrational, unjustifiable” and a violation of the rules of sport and universally recognised human rights,” she said. In her first extensive remarks about the rule since it was announced in April, Caster said she was upset at being in the spotlight again. “I do not like talking about this new rule. I just want to run naturally, the way I was born. It is not fair that I am told I must change. “It is not fair that people question who I am.” The new rule is an attempt by the association to reinstate regulations governing female athletes with high testosterone levels. The association said in a statement that athletes with differences of sexual development could have a 5-6% advantage in performance over athletes with testosterone in the normal female range. It said: “This is an enormous difference in events where milliseconds count. The effects are most clearly seen in races over distances between 400m and one mile.” A spokesperson for the federation said: “We stand ready to defend the new regulation at the Court of Arbitration, should we be asked to do so.”
