TAXI commuters are living in fear of the massive petrol increase of 82 cents per litre that comes into effect today. They fear a large chunk of their salaries will go towards their transport fare. National Taxi Alliance spokesman Theo Malele said commuters will be given notice when the prices are due to increase. He said associations will send out notices as soon as possible. Malele said government has shown a lack of vision by not subsidising petrol for taxis. “They should consider scrapping VAT on petrol for taxis,” he told Daily Sun. “This will not benefit taxis but commuters. It’s sad for the poor of our nation.” Daily Sun asked commuters how they felt about the increase. Ketlhoilwe Tjale (28) from Hammanskraal said she spends about R70 a day on transport. She said: “If they increase the fares I will end up using nearly all my salary on transport. What would I be working for?” She said she prays that taxis do not increase fares. Paul Maluleke (35) from Mamelodi West said although he doesn’t own a taxi, the increase will hit taxi owners and commuters the hardest. He said taxi owners are struggling to make a profit, having to pay off their taxis’ instalments and drivers’ salaries. “Something is wrong with our current government,” he said. “Things can’t keep increasing in a country where the majority of the people are poor.”
