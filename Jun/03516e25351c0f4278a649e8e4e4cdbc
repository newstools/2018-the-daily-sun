A COURT is to decide whether a man can be held
responsible for his girlfriend’s death after she killed herself because he
threatened her with revenge porn. According to The
Mirror, Alessio Bianchi (26) appeared at Westminster coroner’s court in London,
England last week to see if there is strong enough evidence that he can be
charged with manslaughter. Bianchi was already given a 12-week suspended sentence in
April for sharing private sexual photos and films on the intent to cause
distress, and one count of assault. Damilya Jossipalenya (24) plunged 24 metres to her death
from her London flat window on 2 June last year. She jumped the day after being
moered by Bianchi and told by him that he’s sharing private sex images of the
two of them on the internet. It was when he threatened to send a clip to her relatives
of her performing a sex act on him with a friend that Damilya allegedly
cracked. The two were reportedly in a toxic relationship, with
CCTV footage on the night of her death showing him spitting on her, strangling
her and then throwing her into a pond. Bianchi claims he treated her like that because he had
just stopped her from throwing herself out of her eighth floor window. Cop Emma Kirby told The
Sun: “We have been asked to look into whether there has been a history of
domestic abuse that could have deteriorated the deceased’s mental state to a
point where she might have committed suicide.” Bianchi’s lawyer Steven Powles said: “It cannot be said
that the defendant’s actions caused the suicide, only that he knew his actions
related to a vulnerable woman.” The hearing was adjourned until later this year.
