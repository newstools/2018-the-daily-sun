There were three separate cash-in-transit heists on Monday
morning. This ahead of an address by Police Minister Bheki Cele in which he
announced plans to tackle aggravated robbery in the country. In one incident at a garage in Krugersdorp, west of
Johannesburg, seven suspects armed with AK-47s and handguns confronted security
while they were transporting money from the garage. "An undisclosed amount was taken and the suspects fled
the scene in a white Toyota Corolla and Hilux bakkie," said Gauteng Hawks
spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu. "The suspects fired several shots as they were driving
away.  No one was injured."  In a second incident, an unknown number of suspects robbed a
cash-in-transit van on Alexander Road in King William's Town, in the Eastern
Cape. Police spokesperson Captain Siphokazi Mawisa said one
suspect had been arrested, while the others had fled with an undisclosed amount
of money. The third incident happened in the eMalahleni area in
Mpumalanga. Provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said he
wasn’t immediately available to comment, as he was still waiting for more
information. SOURCE: NEW24
