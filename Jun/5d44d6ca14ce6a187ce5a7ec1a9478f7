“YOU’RE a majestic and noble man. Your bravery was a shield for the nation, poised to hurl on apartheid.” These are lines from a poem written in honour of Tata Nelson Mandela. Ndangariro Muuya loves the former president, who would have turned 100 next month. The 32-year-old from Laudium in Tshwane started writing the poem last February. He said he started writing poetry in 2003 when he was still at high school, back in his home country of Zimbabwe. Ndangariro said although he has never met or seen Madiba, he felt a strong connection with him. “I don’t know how I can show the love and happiness I have towards one of the most celebrated leaders in the world.” Ndangariro told Daily Sun he would be happy if his poem could be featured during the Mandela month celebrations. “I wrote it to commemorate Mandela Day and also pay tribute to him for his passion, courage and love for people of all races.”
