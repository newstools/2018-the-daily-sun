THE Eastern Cape Education Department blames sugar daddies for the increase in teenage pregnancy. According to the department, they impregnate schoolkids and spread sexually transmitted infections. Zukiswa Njotina, acting director of social planning, said this at the department’s 14th annual youth conference. The three-day conference is being held at Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth and will end today. Its aim is to create awareness about social ills that have a negative impact on schoolwork. “Last year, 15 474 schoolgirls fell pregnant and it looks like the figure will increase this year,” said Njotina. “The purpose of this conference is to warn young girls to stay away from sugar daddies. “We also want to teach them about the danger of sleeping with older men in exchange for gifts and money. “There was an increase in the number of young girls with sexually transmitted infections, especially in the province’s metros. “OR Tambo alone has 2 886 infected pupils. They’re not getting infected at school. “We need the community to prevent pupils from going into taverns because that’s where they contract these diseases.” Pupil Likhona Lutywantsi (15) said: “I learnt a lot of things here and I’ll share the information with my peers.”
