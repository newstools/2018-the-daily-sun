RESIDENTS of Vastrap are gatvol and want action. About 500 residents from the squatter camp in Port Elizabeth have been protesting since last Thursday against crime in their area. They vowed to continue protesting unless their municipality moves them to a safer place. Community leader Sondlo Sizani (47) told Daily Sun: “This place is not safe. Criminals rob us in broad daylight. “Cops can’t even get between the shacks because they’re close to each other.” Single mum Sino Ndanga (40), who lives with her 14-year-old child, said: “We can’t even visit our rural homes. “Criminals break into our shacks and steal everything. “They also steal zinc and other building material to sell to scrap dealers. “Our children are not safe. We have to escort them to school because criminals rob them of their lunch boxes, calculators and money. “The municipality has promised to move us, but we’re still here.” Nqaba Bhanga, Nelson Mandela Bay’s head of human settlements, said the squatters should wait until suitable land is found. “These are some of the effects of illegal occupation of municipal land,” he said. “The place is overcrowded and there are no roads. They should follow the normal channels to apply for houses. “We’ll move them when land is available.”
