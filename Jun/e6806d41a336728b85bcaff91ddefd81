MVELISO Ntaba wants his family to live in a mansion with a view of the sea one day. But while he waits for his luck to turn, the 27-year-old from Ivory Park near Tembisa, in Ekurhuleni, makes models of dream mansions out of old boxes. He told Daily Sun: “I am someone who dreams big. I want to have a mansion for myself and my family. “I am motivated by people such as Bill Gates, people with houses that face the ocean and mountains.” Mveliso said he completed a diploma in office administration in 2015 but could not find a job. He started selling eggs, fruit and vegetables and when the boxes from his stock piled up he started making his models. He later stopped selling food after some of his eggs expired. “I started making art out of boxes. I started with a small house and then mansions when I had sharpened my skills,” he said. Mveliso said he even made a mall with 144 shops and four drive-throughs, but he gave it to children to play with because there was no space for it in his house. The houses Mveliso makes have cool features such as slides, pools, helicopter pads, tennis courts, tree houses, cinemas and basketball courts. He said he also made jewellery and other crafts and he wanted to design houses for people. He said he loves architecture but does not have the funds to study it. He said he wanted a big house so he could take people from his kasi with drug addictions there and keep them busy by teaching them skills.
