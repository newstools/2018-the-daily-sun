COMMUTERS using Joburg’s Metrobus service were left stranded yesterday when drivers went on strike. Members of the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa didn’t pitch up for work because they are unhappy with their salaries. Commuters complained the strike action was especially inconvenient as the petrol prices reached an all-time high. William Ndlovu told Daily Sun: “We are already under huge financial strain as commuters. Now I have to find money for alternative transport I didn’t budget for.” Phumzile Ximba said: “I loaded my card on Monday. Now I have to fork out more money for alternative transport.” Union spokesman Dion Makhura said they were calling on all workers to go on strike to force the city to deal with issues they were raising. “One of the biggest issues we have is progression. People must get salary increases on a three-year basis. Another issue is in the last six months, we saw the employer hiring people at lower salaries,” he said. Metrobus spokesman Goodwill Shiburi said they were in negotiations with the union all day on Tuesday but couldn’t reach an agreement. He said the negotiation process was likely to be a long one. The biggest issue was that the city didn’t officially recognise the union, as the municipality said it didn’t have enough members.
