SATURDAY was a day to remember for the people of Maboloka Village, near Brits in North West. Businessman Robert Ngwenya and his actress wife Zinhle Mabena hosted the annual Nyaope Must Fall event at Maboloka Taxi Sports Grounds. The queen of gqom music, Busiswa, multi-award winning rapper Kwetsa, Kid X, house music producer DJ Maphorisa and actors Sthembiso “SK” Khoza, Abdul Khoza, Thato Molamu and other celebrities dished out free advice to the youth. They all urged the young people to keep away from drugs. Ngwenya pleaded with drug addicts to look for help. “I am here to help. Come forward . . . I am willing to help you overcome this challenge,” he said. The businessman donated R100 000 to the Nyaope Must Fall campaign. He said R50 000 would go to Kwesta because he performed at this annual event free of charge. “Kwesta is a champion of the campaign. “He has also managed to help some of these youngsters kick the habit for good,” Ngwenya said. He is planning to launch the campaign nationwide. “I am hoping to hold a similar event in Welkom, Free State, in September.”
