PLATINUM Stars captain Vuyo Mere says it is heartbreaking, but they deserved to get relegated. After finishing at the bottom of Absa Premiership table, Dikwena were automatically relegated to the National First Division (NFD). But they were given a lifeline after Safa arbitrator William Mokhari ruled that Ajax Cape Town must be docked nine points for fielding the ineligible Tendai Ndoro against Dikwena, Polokwane City and SuperSport United. That resulted in Ajax being relegated outright and Stars moving up to 15th place, which gave them a chance to save their status via the play-offs. But Dikwena failed to make use of the second chance, playing four matches without a single victory. They will now ply their trade in the NFD with Ajax. The disappointed Mere said they only had themselves to blame for their downfall. He said: “There’s no excuse – we did not do well this season. We deserve to be where we are, as we failed to do the job on the field. We cannot be pointing fingers at anyone. “After working hard and setting the bar high in the last few years, it is heartbreaking to go down to the NFD this way. A lot has happened but as players we cannot be looking for excuses. If you have a job you must do it. The team got relegated because we failed to win games throughout the season.” SunSport has reliably learnt that the veteran defender won’t be going down to the NFD with the club. But Mere played his cards close to his chest and didn’t want to reveal whether he was staying or leaving Dikwena. “My focus was on helping the team remain in the PSL, but that didn’t happen. Now we will leave everything up to management. “The first thing I think about is our families, people who depend on us for a living. This is like losing your job. It’s a bitter pill to swallow,” concluded Mere.
