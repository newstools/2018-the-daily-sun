THE Western Cape High Court has declared that the Democratic Alliance (DA)’s dismissal of Mayor Patricia De Lille was unlawful! The Court delivered the judgment on Wednesday following a lengthy court battle between De Lille and the DA. De Lille was dismissed from her party after a radio interview in which she said she would resign. Reading the judgment, Judge Andre Le Grange said that the DA failed to comply with its own Constitution in their dismissal of De Lille. “Our finding is that membership does not cease automatically upon the comments,” he said, reading the judgment. “It is in fact dependent on a determination made by the DA's FLC, which must in turn be referred to the party's leaders. Le Grange also said that the Federal Council’s panel was required to make recommendations to the federal executive on who the other alternate members appointed to the panel would be. He also said that the DA was supposed to give De Lille an opportunity to present her negations in the wake of the dismissal. “It follows that the cessation of De Lille's membership cannot stand,” he said. Speaking to journalists outside of the court, De Lille said that she will continue to fight for justice.
