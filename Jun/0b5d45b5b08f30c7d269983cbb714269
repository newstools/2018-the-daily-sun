THE community of Mamelodi, Tshwane, has joined forces with an anti-rape organisation to demand justice for a rape victim. The girl (12) was raped last month and residents claim the culprit is a 76-year-old businessman who is her neighbour. The suspect made a bail application at Mamelodi West Magistrates Court on Tuesday. The application was denied. Residents and anti-rape activists picketed outside court. Not in My Name secretary-general Themba Masango said his organisation is tired of what is happening in Mzansi. He said he is not happy with the way woman and kids are treated. “We have a huge crisis on our hands. “Women and children are raped and killed every day,” he said. Masango said the law must take its course. “We are asking for a speedy and accurate verdict.” Resident Victoria Nkuna (38) said the police must start doing their jobs properly. “The police are failing us. “Some of them take bribes from businesspeople who have broken the law,” she said. Victoria said the community wants the culprit to pay for what he did. “Justice must be served. “A horrible crime was committed against that young girl. What was done to her was shameful. “The community will be disappointed if the man is let off the hook. Mamelodi West police spokesman Captain Michael Maheso said the suspect will make his next court appearance on 30 July.
