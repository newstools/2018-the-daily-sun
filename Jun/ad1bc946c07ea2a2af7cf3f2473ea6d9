Luther Singh received the brunt of the blame for Bafana Bafana's embarrassing exit in the COSAFA Cup after an embarrassing defeat to Madagascar at the quarter-final stage. Stuart Baxter's men crashed out of the tournament at the first hurdle to a lowly Madagascar side 4-3 on penalties after the scores were goalless after 90 minutes. South Africa at one stage were leading 3-1 in the shoot-out when efforts by Jamie Webber and Singh were saved, with Madagascar converting their remaining penalties. Singh summed up Bafana's attitude in the game when he strolled up nonchalantly to hit a tame effort that was duly saved by the goalkeeper. When trying to coolly slot home a penalty like this, the player has more to lose than gain. If Singh had scored he would have shown himself how good he was. But miss and you are at risk of looking like a fool and costing your team. The young striker was clearly thinking about himself first before his team and the many fans who came out to support Bafana Bafana. Singh received strong criticism on social media with fans questioning his attitude and accusing him of being arrogant since a move to Europe. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
