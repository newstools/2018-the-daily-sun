FRIENDS and family were left shocked when six men took Sfiso Ngcobo’s coffin away from his funeral on Saturday! The men, who were wearing red T-shirts, are believed to have been from the Abahlali baseMjondolo movement. Ngcobo (49) was one of their leaders. Ngcobo’s wife Khonzephi (55) and mourners at the funeral held in Itshelimnyama, eThekwini, were in disbelief following the incident. Khonzephi told Daily Sun she was very angry when the body was taken. “Ngcobo was living with his fiancee in Ehlathini squatter camp and I was living with the kids in Itshelimnyama,” she said. Khonzephi and her husband had been living separately for two years but they were on good terms and were still legally married. She said the day her husband was murdered he dropped in for a chat. She said the family had opened a criminal case against Abahlali baseMjondolo. Ngcobo’s fiancee, Phumzile Mkhize, said: “We were not on speaking terms with his first wife. Sfiso told me he was planning to divorce her.” Abahlali baseMjondolo president Sbu Zikode confirmed they had taken the coffin. “We took the body to the venue the movement and the Ngcobo family had agreed on,” said Zikode. The SunTeam went back to Khonzephi, who said there was no agreement with the movement. She suspected someone in the family had made arrangements with them in secret as her late husband was to be buried in the grave the family had paid for. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “A case of violation of a corpse is being investigated by Mariannhill cop shop.”
