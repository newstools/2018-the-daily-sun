Uzalo ’s GC  is known as Mzansi’s drama queen. But in real life, actor Khaya Dladla is nothing like GC. Khaya (29), from Umlazi, the fifth child in a family of six siblings, is a cool guy who doesn’t like his character all that much. The actor told Daily Sun about his difficulties with his role. “It was challenging to portray GC. He is a township gay who owns a saloon and is a prima donna. “I don’t relate because I’m nothing like him. I had to do research to find other GCs out there so I could play the part. “I had to look deep into the role because I’m nothing like him.” Speaking about his journey, Khaya said: “I’ve been in this business for 20 years and have always been the working kid. “I used to be away from school for months at a time but would come back to write my exams after my shoots.” He has worked with entertainment legends like Duma Ndlovu and Mbongeni Ngema and on productions like Sophiatown, The Sound of Music and many others. “I come from a musical background and still enjoy musicals,” he said. Dladla said playing GC has opened many doors for him. “I mean, GC is Uzaloand Uzalo is GC but the greatest thing about all this are the lives I have touched. “I’m grateful to be the one who tells this story because not many characters fully portray gays in the township who still are in the closet. Hopefully, this will break down barriers.”
