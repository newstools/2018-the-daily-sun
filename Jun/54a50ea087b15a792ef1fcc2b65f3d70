THOUSANDS of internet viewers around the world cheered in
relief this morning when a raccoon that had been climbing a 25-storey building for
20 hours finally made it safely to the top. #MPRraccoon gripped thousands as it followed the
painstaking progress of the little furry fellow as it made its way up the sheer
face of UBS tower in Minnesota. Traps have been set for the raccoon on the roof so it can
safely be returned to Planet Earth.
