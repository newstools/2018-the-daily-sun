Durban House and Gqom music boss, DJ Tira is one of the most sought after talents in the entertainment industry. Everything the Makoya Bearings touches turns into gold and he is so often at the center of everything good that comes out of Durban. In case you were wondering, the Afrotainment kingpin does not come cheap, and he recently took to social media to let people know how much a DJ Tira feature now costs. “For all artists/ DJs who wants Chikichikichaaaaaa on their songs.... the price has gone up! R50k. Verse is R70k. Chorus is R100k. Faka imali uzobona! Uzongithola eAfro!,” said Tira. A DJ Tira feature often equals a hit song, perhaps he can actually afford to set the prices this high. But many on social media were not convinced.
