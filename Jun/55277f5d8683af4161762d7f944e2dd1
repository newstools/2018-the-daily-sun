A MISSING green Toyota Tazz has been found. Only a day after Daily Sun published the story on Thursday of a woman who lost her car when her new boyfriend tricked her into giving up the vehicle, Limpopo cops recovered the vehicle. The woman told cops she met the man on Facebook. But the man is still on the run. The car was found in a yard in Acornhoek, Mpumalanga on Friday. Cops said another white Tazz was recovered there too. The car had no registration number. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, said investigations have revealed that the vehicle was stolen in Kempton Park, Gauteng. “The suspect is still on the run,” he said. “We are warning people to be aware of the dangers of falling in love with people on social media.” The recovered Tazz belongs to a woman (45) from Mbekwana Village outside Tzaneen. The woman was left feeling desperate after her boyfriend disappeared with her car. She said it happened after they had spent the weekend together. The victim told the cops the suspect introduced himself to her on Facebook as Brian Mabasa. She said the man told her he worked at a hospital in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga. The woman was at Tzaneen Lifestyle shopping centre when her lover disappeared with the car. She said she had known the man for about three months. Ngoepe said the suspect was believed to be using different names to trick women.
