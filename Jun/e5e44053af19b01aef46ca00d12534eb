THE DA has threatened to take eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede to court. Party official Solly Malatsi said she’d failed to implement former public protector Thuli Madonsela’s advice on fixing Glebelands Hostel, south of Durban. The human settlements parliamentary portfolio committee member said on Tuesday he’d visited the hostel last month and seen the horrible conditions residents lived in. He said he was waiting for parliament to resume in August to raise the matter in the committee. “I was there myself last month to get first-hand information on progress made on fixing the hostel, as recommended by Madonsela,” said Malatsi. He said recommendations were binding, and because the mayor hadn’t implemented them his party would to take her to court. He said he’d ask committee members to see for themselves how bad conditions were at the notorious hostel. Madonsela’s 2016 report, after her visit there, advised the mayor to find out who and how many people lived there and to control access. Residents told Daily Sun this week a satellite cop shop and 24-hour patrols were the only recommendations that had been implemented so far. Acting spokesman Mandla Nsele said he’d talk to municipal manager Sipho Nzuza and asked to be emailed questions. He had not responded to the questions at the time of going to print.
