TRANSPORT Minister Blade Nzimande has recommended that truck owners who hire illegal immigrants be jailed. Nzimande said this on Friday during a surprise visit to the Mkondeni Testing Centre in Pietermaritzburg. His call comes after truck drivers blocked the dangerous Van Reenen’s Pass on Wednesday, bringing traffic to a standstill on the N3 between Harrismith and the Tugela Toll Plaza. The drivers were apparently complaining about foreigners taking their jobs. Nzimande said he was working around the clock to have such truck owners prosecuted. “The N3 between Durban and Joburg is our busiest highway, and that’s why we arrested drivers,” he said. “But we’re not going to focus on drivers only. “We’ve impounded the trucks and the owners must come forward. We’re also going to charge them.” He said there was a bargaining council that dealt with labour issues affecting truck owners and drivers. He said as much as he understood the drivers’ frustrations, he equally condemned illegal road closures. “What the drivers did at Van Reenen’s Pass is unacceptable,” he said. “No matter how angry you are, you can’t block the road.  If you block the N3, you’re shutting down a large part of South Africa’s economy.”
