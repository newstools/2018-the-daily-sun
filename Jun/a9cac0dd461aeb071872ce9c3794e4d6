All roads will lead to Durban on the 7th of July as the annual Vodacom Durban July takes place in the city. Although the main business of the day will be the horse-racing action, fans will also descend upon the Greyville Racecourse for the fashion, celebrities, food and of course, music. The Amstel BoomTown marquee is promising to be an “amplified journey of SA’s very own vibrant, electric sounds with the biggest local artists”. Having recently announced its new sponsorship of the biggest hospitality marquee at the Durban July, Amstel together with BoomTown will bring fans an entertainment lineup that will take music lovers on a proudly South African musical journey at this year’s horse racing extravaganza. House DJs Shimza and Maphorisa will headline the “bigger-than-ever” marquee and will be joined on stage by legendary Mostwako artist, HHP. Also taking to the stage on the day will be Bongo Maffin, Babes Wodumo, DreamTeam and many more. “Not only will Amstel BoomTown offer an optimum lifestyle experience combining music, fashion, horse racing along with other surprises to be revealed on the day; it will also provide an unmatched line up of SA acts that will make the Amstel stage, the loudest stage at Africa’s biggest horse racing event,” said Amstel South Africa’s Marketing Manager, Khaya Dlanga. Tickets to the Amstel BoomTown are available from Computicket and range from R690 for general to R3 500 for VVIP.
