THE family of eight-year-old Nokubonga Nonyane, who was raped and murdered, will have to wait a while longer before setting eyes on the devil who took the little girl’s life. Members of the Nonyane family were denied access to court when the man accused of killing Nokubonga appeared in the Kabokweni Magistrates Court on Tuesday. This was to allow for an identity parade to be conducted before the suspect faced charges in court. The 23-year-old suspect was arrested on Sunday in Sabie. According to the court, police hadn’t finalised their investigation and the accused still had to go through an identity parade. The suspect allegedly confessed to killing Nokubonga and dumping her body in a ditch in Numbi, near Hazyview. Her body was found by a passerby on 11 June. Her father, George Nonyane, told Daily Sun: “We are not happy because we wanted to see him. They should have allowed us to sit in court and see him because that’s what we came for. “We are not satisfied at all that we couldn’t see the devil who has caused us this never-ending pain.” The court assured the family that they will see the suspect at his next appearance. The matter was postponed to 27 July for a formal bail application.
