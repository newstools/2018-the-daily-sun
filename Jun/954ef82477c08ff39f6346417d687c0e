Rasta Pempho Howahowa (37) is proud to be African. People can see this in the colourful African-inspired clothing, jewellery, hats, bags and scarfs that he makes. The Rastaman started his business in 2014. He sells his goods from his small stall which he calls the Zomba Centre of Attraction. Pempho, who is originally from Malawi, lives in Zwelihle in Hermanus. “When I express myself, it’s important that I represent Africans. “I love what I do because it represents who I am and where I come from,” he said. Pempho, who has long dreadlocks, said he also did other people’s hair. “When it comes to dreadlocks, I can do anything.” He said he can do various hairstyles and sometimes he twists dreadlocks from scratch. He charges between R150 and R350 to do people’s hair. Pempho said it was important for people not to wait for government to give them jobs. “We all know job opportunities are scarce everywhere. It’s not only here in South Africa. I have been here for about 15 years and I am happy about what I have achieved so far. “I thank God because he blessed me with many talents and I use them all,” he said. Pempho said what keeps his customers coming back is that he keeps his prices low. “I know that most people do not work and that is why I do not charge them too much.” Nokonwabisa Nakani (37) said she loved Pempho’s work. “I always buy my hats from him as they are good quality. “I know that when I buy from him I’m not wasting my money.”
