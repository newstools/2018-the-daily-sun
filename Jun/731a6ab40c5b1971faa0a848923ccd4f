Many people suffer from dark pigmentation on some parts of their bodies and that is merely because of the deodorants they use or the waxing treatments they go for and some it's their medical conditions that might lead to dark pigmentation. Usually, people who are going through some hormonal treatments, people with diabetes, obese people, and those who are suffering from genitourinary or gastrointestinal cancer have these dark patches.
