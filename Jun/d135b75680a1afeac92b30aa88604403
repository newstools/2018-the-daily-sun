EFFORTS by relatives to help a man kick his booze
addiction backfired badly last week when the mixture meant to cure him killed
him instead. According to Lusaka
Times, heavy drinker Misheck Kasoka (30) lived in Katupisha village in southern
Zambia. His relatives decided they had to do something about his
drinking habit. Charles Kapusu, an uncle with knowledge of the powers of herbs,
mixed up a concoction that was intended to put an end to Misheckâ€™s problem. But when Misheck drank the muthi last Wednesday, he
almost immediately fell ill, and died before he could get medical help. Cops have arrested Kapusu on suspicion of unintentionally
killing his nephew. Kabompo Central Ward Councillor, Victor Muhanga, warned
against using muthi and encouraged Zambians to use counselling services at
hospitals instead to deal with issues such as alcohol.
