MINISTER Aaron Motsoaledi said, contrary to popular opinion, the public healthcare system hasn’t collapsed. The health minister was speaking at a media briefing in Tshwane yesterday. But he admitted the demand for health services had grown and that the system was overloaded. “This has resulted in longer waiting times at most facilities and the lowering of quality at others,” Motsoaledi told Daily Sun. “We accept and are very worried about extreme overcrowding at our hospitals. He said the situation could have been worse if the department had not taken proactive steps. “But I’m not here to challenge that because I don’t know the yardstick that was used to arrive at that conclusion,” he said. He said Mzansi’s healthcare system was able to provide treatment to the largest number of HIV-positive people in the world. “Our programme is the biggest in the world, at 4,2 million people,” said Motsoaledi. The minister said a large number of empty posts still needed to be filled in North West and Gauteng. “This month we’re going to fill 223 vacancies, at a cost of R150 million,” he said.
