A JAPANESE civil servant is in kak after being bust
leaving work for his lunch hour three minutes early. According to The
Guardian, the 64-year-old employee of the waterworks bureau in the western
city of Kobe was fined and scolded after he was bust by a colleague for leaving
his desk three minutes before the 12pm start of lunch hour, 26 times over a
seven-month period. His colleague apparently spotted him as he walked to a restaurant
that sells takeaways. The unnamed man was found guilty of breaking a public
service law that officials must “concentrate on their jobs”. Senior officials at the water bureau called a press
conference last Friday where they gave a deep bow to express their apology and
described the man’s behaviour as “deeply regrettable”. He was fined half a day’s pay and warned not to do it
again. In his defence, the man said he had done so because he
needed a “change of pace”. Japan has a national condition known as “karoshi”, which
is death caused by overwork. The government was forced to do something about the
national norm of hectic, long working hours in 2015 after Matsuri Takahashi, a
24-year-old employee of a major advertising firm, killed herself after being
forced to work more than 100 hours overtime a month, including at weekends. The government estimates that one in five employees were
at risk of karoshi. MPs last month passed a bill capping overtime at 100
hours a month.
