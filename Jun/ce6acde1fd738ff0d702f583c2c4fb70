THE embattled South African power producer Eskom has made
another offer to union as the negotiations continue. On Wednesday, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the
National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) and Solidarity rejected
Eskom’s offer of 6.2%. They had met with Eskom management through the Central
Bargaining Forum to resume wage talks Wednesday. Earlier on Wednesday Eskom deputy spokesperson Dikatso
Mothae told Fin24 that an offer was presented, but Eskom is of the view that
this is the first of three days of wage talks. "As far as we are concerned there are still two days of
negotiations left in the talks and we would like to leave an opportunity for
Eskom and the unions to settle on a mutually agreeable increase,” said Mothae. Last week the unions jointly proposed a plan for how Eskom
can reduce cost drivers, while also generating enough money for wage increases
and guaranteeing the long-term sustainability of the state-owned power utility. The unions asked for a 9% wage increase for 2018; an 8.6%
increase for the second year; and an 8.5% increase for 2020. Eskom, on the other hand, offered a 5% wage hike for 2018;
an inflation plus 0.6% increase for 2019; and an inflation plus 0.7% for the
third year.
