PORT Elizabeth residents are growing angrier by the hour and have been left queueing for water since their taps ran dry on Monday afternoon. Scores of people in kasis like Kwazakhele, Missionvale and Govan Mbeki are lining up at communal taps in other areas for water. Other areas were also affected. The residents’ anger is also fuelled by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality’s failure to inform them about the cause of the water cuts. Nokubonga Peter (41) of KwaNdokwenza kasi, told Daily Sun: “We don’t have a councillor since ours is in jail. Now we are left suffering. There was no warning and there is no truck from the municipality to give us water. This is very bad.” Hair salon owner in KwaZakhele, Anita Anderson (49), said: “I’m worried about my bills as I’ve had to turn away my clients.”
