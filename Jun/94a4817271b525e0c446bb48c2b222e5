Simon Phoku wants to divorce his runaway bride, but he has no clue where to find her. The 59-year-old man from Merry Pebble Stream Village outside Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga said he last saw his wife, Ntombi Nkosi, 11 years ago. “After I had paid lobola for her in 2007, I never saw her again,” said Simon. He told Daily Sun they met at Thulamahashe Mall in 1998. “It was love at first sight and I proposed to her the next year.” Simon was working as a taxi driver then. “She told me I was her dream husband. I was so happy, I even introduced her to my mother and sons,” said Simon. “My mum loved her and she became more like a second mother to her. She even gave me three cows to pay for her lobola,” said Simon. “The lobola negotiations went well in February 2007, but Ntombi disappeared the same day. I never saw her again.” Simon said when he called her she kept telling him stories. “I want her to come back so that we can officially go our separate ways,” he said. “She played me. What hurts me the most is that we were married in community of property.” Daily Sun called Ntombi, but her phone goes straight to voicemail.
