A KASI family has been left homeless after their shack was destroyed by fire in Soshanguve block W, Tshwane on Wednesday morning. The family of four told Daily Sun they were not home when the incident happened. Zodwa Mahwayi (27) said she was in the area when her neighbours called to say her home was on fire. “I couldn’t believe it when I arrived home. It was like a nightmare, seeing our shack on fire.” She said even though they lost almost everything, she’s relieved no one was hurt. “I am relieved no one was home because things could have been worse.” Zodwa said they suspect the fire was caused by their electricity meter box. “Our neighbours told us the meter box had exploded before the shack caught fire,” she told the People’s Paper. Zodwa’s uncle, James Mahwayi (57), owned the shack. He said he was at work when the incident happened. “I received a call from Zodwa to say I should immediately come back home. “When I arrived my shack was completely destroyed by fire,” James told Daily Sun. He said he didn’t know how he would rebuild the shack as he is the only breadwinner in the family. “We have lost almost everything. Our furniture, electrical appliances, clothes, important documents and the kids’ school uniforms have been destroyed by fire. We are forced to live with our neighbours for now because we are left with nothing.” He said they would appreciate any help from SunReaders. “We pray to God to sees us through this trying time and hope Good Samaritans will help us.”
