GRADE 12s in the Free State are putting their education first this school holiday. About 1 200 pupils from different schools have registered for winter classes, even sacrificing their Saturdays. The Monyetla Bursary Project kicked off on Wednesday at the University of Free State’s south campus in Bloemfontein. The idea is to improve their results so they qualify for bursaries to help them study at university. Project co-ordinator Chris Grobler told Daily Sun: “The bursary project in partnership with the Free State Education Department is carrying out its mission of helping high school pupils by improving their marks. “This year, we’re presenting 14 subjects. “We’ve included technical mathematics, engineering, graphic design and technical science. Classes run from 8am – 5pm. “Pupils come for winter school from Welkom, Ficksburg, Ladybrand and even other provinces like North West and Limpopo.” “Pupils attend classes for free. “Transport is sponsored by the Interstate Bus Line and pupils from Thaba Nchu, Botshabelo and Brandford travel for free.”
