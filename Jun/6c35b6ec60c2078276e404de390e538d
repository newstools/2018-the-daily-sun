NOT only was the taxi driving in the emergency lane but it had, instead of a licence disc, a paper circle cut from a document advertising repairs of washing machines and microwaves, among other things! Unfortunately for the cheeky driver, his taxi was stopped by Joburg Metro Police chief David Tembe himself on Friday morning. JMPD spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said: “The chief of police stopped a taxi for driving in the emergency lane on the M1 South at Glenhove off-ramp. That was not the only law he was breaking. . . “His taxi was also unlicensed.” Minnaar said when cops saw that the writing on the disc was adverting the repair and installation of household appliances, they impounded the taxi. “Eight other taxis were also fined R500 each at the same spot for using the emergency lane and they were impounded for being unroadworthy,” Minnaar said. In a separate operation on Friday, the Metro Police, the K9 unit, Gauteng Traffic Police and the Hawks raided Dube Hostel in Soweto and arrested four men. Two of the suspects were wanted for a double murder and for shooting at Metro cops and K9 members last month. “Those two were found in possession of explosives linked to recent cash-in-transit heists. “All four of the suspects have been detained at Meadowlands Police Station and are due to appear in court soon,” said Minnaar. He warned taxi drivers that if they put fake licence discs on their vehicles they would be caught. “We are aware of what they are doing and they will suffer the consequences,” he said.
