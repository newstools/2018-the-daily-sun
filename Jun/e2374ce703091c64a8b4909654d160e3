AN ALLEGED hijacker who can’t drive properly will appear in court today . . . He crashed a hijacked vehicle while being chased by Port Elizabeth cops! Captain Andre Beetge told Daily Sun: “The driver of the suspected hijacked white VW Polo refused to stop at a road block in New Brighton on Thursday at about midday and a chase ensued. “Flying squad backup joined the chase through New Brighton. The VW Polo had no front number plates while the back number plate was false. “During the chase the suspect allegedly pointed a firearm at cops, who returned fire. “Later, the suspect lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a fence. “He tried to run but was caught and arrested. No one was injured.” Beetge said the suspect had earlier allegedly robbed kids on their way to school. “A robbery case was opened after two cellphones were taken at gunpoint from kids at Ikamvelihle. “The two cellphones were found in two school bags inside the stolen vehicle. “The suspect (26) will appear in the New Brighton Magistrates Court on charges of pointing a firearm, possession of a stolen vehicle, possession of stolen property and reckless and negligent driving. “More charges could be added once he’s linked with the hijacking.”
