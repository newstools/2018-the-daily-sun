FOUR women are among the 26 bust by cops last week in southern Nigeria for suspected child trafficking and other crimes. According to Punch, Abia State cops held a press briefing on Monday during which they paraded the suspects, which included two young mothers. Gift Daniel (17) is alleged to have sold her two-day-old baby boy for N670 000 (about R24 000). She said her first baby, also a boy, had been sold by her own mother soon after being born. Daniel said: “My mother sent me away from the house when I became pregnant with the second baby and because of financial difficulties, I started looking for somebody to help me.” Ngozi Nwaiwu (38) is suspected of arranging the sale. She claimed to be doing it to help Daniel in her difficult situation. The nurse, Kate Charles, who helped Daniel with her delivery was also arrested. Blessing Chukwu (22) is accused of selling her three-week-old baby girl. She said she already had four kids out of wedlock and said she was driven by poverty to the evil action. Her alleged buyer, Chinasa Okpara (40), said she bought the child for N360 000 (about R13 000) and did so because she had been unable to have kids in her 13-year-old marriage. The health practitioners who aided Chukwu in her labour were also arrested. Two other women – Rose Chukwu and Joy Sunday – were also bust in the sweep for allegedly attempting to kidnap a little boy as he left school. They claim they thought he was lost and were trying to help him get home.
