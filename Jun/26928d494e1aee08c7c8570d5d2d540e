IT IS a national crisis and the thugs are winning. This was how the dramatic increase in cash in transit heists was described during a discussion on the subject by parliament’s portfolio committee on police yesterday. Cosatu’s Matthew Parks told the committee: “This is really a national crisis right now. “This year we’ve already seen 152 heists and we had 159 last year. “The attacks have become increasingly violent and lethal. We’re not winning this war.” Cops told MPs they’d started an operation to bust those responsible for the heists. National police commissioner General Khehla Sitole said: “We will be searching everywhere in the whole country, so suspects better opt for another country because we’re not going to stop.” The DA’s Dianne Kohler Barnard said there wasn’t a specialised Hawks unit dealing with the heists and asked why suspects were so quickly released on bail. Police Minister Bheki Cele said 10 suspects were bust on Tuesday. “Three were from Limpopo, six from Mpumalanga and one in central Joburg,” he said. Parks said cops and magistrates were being bribed or threatened. “If you’re a magistrate, you’re on your own. God help you if you find these guys guilty. They will find you afterwards,” he said. DA MP Zakhele Mbhele asked why the attacks increased a year before the election. MPs were told the explosives being used in the heists were believed to come from mines.
