A BRITISH man boasts of having poked 2 500 women has been
jailed for trying to dodge paying a restaurant bill. According to The
Mirror, Daniel Wagster (29) and three others went out to celebrate a friend’s
birthday in July 2016 at an upmarket Italian restaurant in Stockton Heath,
Cheshire. The pricey steaks and four bottles of champagne they
consumed over a six hour binge came to a bill of £450 (about R8 000). According to prosecutor Debbie Byrne at the Warrington
Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, "When the restaurant staff brought the
bill over to the table, Wagster complained about the quality of two of the
steaks and these were deducted from the total. "He then told staff that the service was too slow
and the group were going to carry on drinking in the outside area." His friends then left and Wagster continued drinking,
before dashing out into the street and making no attempt to pay the bill. As part of his sentence, Wagster will have to pay the
outstanding bill and spend eight weeks in prison. He has 12 previous convictions for 16 offences including assault,
burglary and harassment, said the report. Wagster became famous in Britain when he boasted of
poking 2 500 women, sometimes in groups of threes and usually without a condom.
