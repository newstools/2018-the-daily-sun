A COMMUNITY in southern Nigeria is in a state of grief
and terror after the gruesome murder of a popular local pastor. According to Punch,
the lifeless body of pastor Friday Isinwa was discovered near his farm in the Ohaji/Egbema
area of Imo State on Monday. Isinwa, who was a farmer as well as a pastor for Seven
Days Church of God, was meant to return home on Saturday having harvested his
cassava. When the dad of four didn’t return or phone, the
community organised a search party. A villager named only as Kingsley said: “The way we found
him showed that his death was terrible; he was stripped naked and made to
suffer before he died. His death is being blamed on the ruthless gangs that have
long terrorised the area, known as the Iceland and Deygbam cults. Their vicious
rivalry has seen many deaths in the area, as well as properties set ablaze,
said the report. Gatvol community members staged a protest after the
discovery of Isinwa’s body. “The community is protesting and we want the government
and security agencies to solve this problem in our community once and for all.
We can’t continue to live in fear of some young men who have chosen to be
thorns in our flesh,” Kingsley said.
