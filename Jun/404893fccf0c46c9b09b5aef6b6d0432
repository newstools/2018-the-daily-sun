TEBOGO Finger founded a training centre for budding security guards in 2015. On Monday 40 trainees graduated from Shanel Trading Security Academy in Phahameng, Bloemfontein. Tebogo said he opened the academy because he wanted to create employment for young people in his kasi. “Most young people end up smoking nyaope and joining gangs because they can’t afford to study at institutions of higher learning,” he said. “Today we are rewarding 40 students who are now qualified to work at any security company they please. “At the moment, I am using my money to pay for my students’ training. “I need funding so I can take in more students. “I hired an assessor, facilitator and moderator but I had to borrow money to pay them. “I’m pleading with good Samaritans to fund my academy.” He said some of his former trainees work for the government. Lefu Rapulana (25), one of the students who graduated, said he was excited to receive his certificate. He said: “I matriculated three years ago but I was still looking for a job. “I would like to thank Tebogo for changing my life.”
