International supermodel, Naomi Campbell has praised our latest national treasure, Siyamthanda Kolisi. It seems like the Victoria Secret angel has quite the soft spot for Mzansi. Not only is she a close family friend of the Mandela family, but Naomi has given a thumbs up to several of our high-profile personalities, mostly recently Trevor Stuurman. And now she just sent a huge shout out to our new national rugby team captain, Siya. Siya recently made history when he became the first black captain of the Springboks, in over 127 years.
