BAFANA Bafana head coach Stuart Baxter believes that after watching some of the matches in the 2018 COSAFA Cup, they will have to prepare for a very tough battle. The hosts  who have been in camp since 26 May preparing for the competition which is underway in Polokwane will play their firszt match in the quarter-finals on Sunday when they take on Group A winner Madagascar. The match is set to take place at Peter Mokoba Staddium, kick-off at 3pm. Bafana coach Baxter admitted that there’s pressure to get results. “The pressure to get the result is the same, whenever the national team gets together everyone expects you to win,” said Baxter as quoted by SAFA website. “The week together gives us a little bit of time before the start of the tournament. Getting these players together and to have seven days on top for preparations, is already a victory - if they can kick on now and gel a little bit, it could be a good tournament for us for a change.”  “The games have been very interesting, and some of them very physical, something that we saw when we played the COSAFA Cup last time. It seems people wind up for this sort of games and they don’t take them lightly,” said Baxter.“No matter who we play, it is going to be a tough game and very hectic, so we have to make sure that we are prepared for that.”
