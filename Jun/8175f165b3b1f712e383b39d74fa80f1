SHE prayed for her son to become a better person but she could never in her worst dreams have imagined what he did to her. Her 19-year-old son, along with his 19-year-old friend, allegedly raped his mother on Sunday! The raped woman’s sister told Daily Sun: “My sister told me before she was taken to hospital what had happened. She said the boys were reading Bible verses while they raped her.” The 43-year-old woman from Hlohlolwane, Clocolan in the Free State is in hospital. The woman’s sister said: “When I realised that my nephew was smoking nyaope, I suggested to my sister that she must come and stay with me but she refused. “She never lost faith in her son. She believed he would get better. She kept praying for him. “My nephew doesn’t need prayers. He needs a beating. This is pure evil,” she said. She said she was at home on Sunday morning when a neighbour told her that her sister had been assaulted. “I rushed to her shack and when I arrived, was shocked to hear she had been raped. The residents had already started giving the boys a beating.” Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said: “A case of rape was opened and two suspects have been arrested.” He said the suspects appeared in the Clocolan Magistrates Court on Tuesday. They will be back in court on Wednesday for formal bail applications.
