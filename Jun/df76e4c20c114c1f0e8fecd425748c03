 OVER 350 pupils from different Soweto schools received
Qhubeka Bicycles on Thursday. The community public private partnership between the City of
Johannesburg, Qhubeka and various corporate and individual donors and
fundraisers shows how partnerships can maximise impact. The children are from
Selelekela Secondary School, Orlando High School, Lofentse Girls High School
and Bona Comprehensive School. Qhubeka Executive Director, Tsatsi Phaweni said the
distribution event is made possible by City of Johannesburg and the grassroots
fundraisers around the world. "The City has committed to an ongoing bicycle programme
in the region, which has included constructing bicycle lanes and funding
bicycles to help schoolchildren and adults with personal transport. Fundraisers who support Qhubeka through our relationship
with Team Dimension Data for Qhubeka then matched the City’s funding to double
the number of bicycles being distributed. At other distribution ceremonies, the funding has come from
businesses." Phaweni said it’s a wonderful example of how partnership can
help move entire communities forward. MMC for Transport in the City of Johannesburg Nonhlanhla
Makhuba said they are very excited to be distributing more bicycles to the
residents of Orlando in partnership with Qhubeka and their partners. "We believe that the more bicycles we distribute in a
particular area, the greater momentum and sustainability there is for the
bicycle promotion programme and the safer it is for individual cyclists,"
she said.
