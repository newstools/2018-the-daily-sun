THEY sit inside mud classrooms that are cracked and freezing. When it’s raining, they have to move the furniture around because the roof leaks. The kids are scared the buildings could collapse at any time. Worst of all are the toilets at Lutsheko Junior School in Ngqeleni near Mthatha. The school has 12 roofless pit toilets for the 278 pupils. Five are for the girls, five for the boys, and two are for teachers. The school has a block of five classrooms, a staff room and a principal’s office that are in good shape, but three of the classrooms are no more than mud shacks. Teachers said one of the mud classrooms collapsed a while ago while a class was in progress. Siphilisiwe Tantsi (9) said she was working hard to pass grade 4 so she could learn in a proper classroom. Parents said they were worried about the safety of their kids, but Lutsheko was the only school in the village. Lungisa Xego (70), who has two grandchildren studying at the school, also had children in the school in the 1970s. “We’re not saying we want a new school, but we would be happy if new blocks could be built,” he said. “We depend on social grants to make ends meet and have been paying to fix the classrooms for years.” SGB chairwoman Sweetness Jange said the department had visited the school three years ago. “We hoped our school would be rebuilt properly,” she said. SRC member Qhawekazi Lusiki (14) said: “We go to the toilets in groups because it’s so dangerous.” Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said they don’t know if the school will be repaired or merged. “We will send assessors to check what can be done,” Mtima told Daily Sun.
