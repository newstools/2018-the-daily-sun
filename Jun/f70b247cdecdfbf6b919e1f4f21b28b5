SUPRA Mahumapelo has resigned as member of the North West provincial
legislature. Mahumapeloâ€™s resignation will lead the way for the swearing
in of Job Mokgoro as the Premier of the embattled North West. The ANC's National Working Committee decided on 70-year-old
Job Mokgoro to be the man who replaces Mahumapelo as the North West premier. Mokgoro is the former director-general in the province; he was
picked during a special NWC meeting on Wednesday night. The party was racing against time as the 30-day deadline to
find a candidate to replace Supra Mahumapelo is today. Mahumapelo went on "early retirement" last month. The judge president of the North West High Court in Mahikeng
had already called for a sitting of the legislature on Friday to fill the
vacancy. If the position is not filled within 30 days, the
Constitution calls for the dissolution of the legislature, forcing an early
election. Mokgoro is expected to be premier until the 2019 elections
as President Cyril Ramaphosa placed the province under administration. It followed weeks of violent protests calling for Mahumapelo
to step down.
