Although Banyana Banyana have one foot in the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (AWC), coach Desiree Ellis is not satisfied with her girls’ performance. Banyana defeated Lesotho 1-0 away in the AWC qualifier on Wednesday to edge closer to the tournament to be held in Ghana from 17 November to 1 December. But Ellis, who believes they could have wrapped up the tie in the first match away, says her players showed little sign of professionalism on the day. “We were very sloppy, not just in performance but our passing, decision-making – everything was really slow,” said the dissatisfied coach. “I’m not happy, we were not where we should be. We got away with a good result which means we are halfway there, but we could have finished off the tie.” Banyana only need a win or draw on Sunday when they host Lesotho at Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein (3pm) to qualify. Ellis stressed the importance of getting goals and confirmed that they have been working hard to improve – but scoring only one goal against Lesotho, not really a strong side, speaks volumes about the current form of Banyana’s attacking players. The coach admits there’s still a lot to do if they are to qualify for the World Cup. If they’re able to qualify for the AWC, Banyana will need to finish the tournament in the top three to qualify for the World Cup. She said: “We still have a lot of hard work ahead of us. “We need to step up, we get chances in front of goal but we do not convert them. We really need to perform better in the second leg. “The ultimate goal is to get to the World Cup but this is where it starts.” Banyana will pin their hopes on strikers Jermaine Seoposenwe and Leandra Smeda, who scored the only goal in Lesotho.
