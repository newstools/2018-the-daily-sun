AT least 25 people were killed when Guatemala's Fuego
volcano erupted yesterday, belching ash and rock and forcing the airport to
close, the country's disaster agency said. "The toll was 25 dead as of 9:00pm," the
spokesperson for the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction said in a
WhatsApp group. Search and rescue operations for the missing and dead
have been suspended due to low light and dangerous conditions, and will resume
early in the morning, the spokesperson said. President Jimmy Morales said he and his government would
determine whether to ask Congress to declare a state of emergency in affected
areas, while at the same time appealing for calm. Hundreds of personnel from the police, Red Cross and
military have been dispatched to support emergency operations, Morales said. It is the second major eruption this year from the peak,
following another that subsided at the beginning of February after sending ash
towering 1,7km into the sky.
