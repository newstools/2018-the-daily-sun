VIDEO footage of an attempted hijacking has surfaced on
social media. The incident reportedly took place on Granaat street in
Lenasia Extension 05. In the video, a grey car can be seen pulling into a driveway
and then a Toyota Corolla suddenly stops behind the car. Two unknown suspects get out of the Corolla holding guns,
but the hijackers assumed that the occupants in the car were armed and then one
of them starts shooting inside the car. The incident reportedly took place on Tuesday afternoon
around 17:07.
