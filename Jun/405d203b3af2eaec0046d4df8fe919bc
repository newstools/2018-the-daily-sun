Little-known South African runner Ann Ashworth stunned the women's field in the 93rd running of the Comrades Marathon from Pietermaritzburg to Durban on Sunday. Ashworth upset the pre-race favourites in crossing the line first at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in a time of 6:10:04 to take not only her first title, but her first Top 10 finish in the “Ultimate Human Race”. Ashworth, founder of the Massmart Running Club in Gauteng, raised her arms in triumph after 90.184km of pain - and glory. Fellow South African Gerda Steyn finished second in 6:15:34, while Russia's Alexandra Morozova took the final podium spot in 6:20:21. SOURCE: SPORT24
