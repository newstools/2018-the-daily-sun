NEDBANK has spiced up its annual campaign, the Ke Yona Team Search, by allowing the public to vote on which club they would prefer players to get drafted for. The banking giant says this is an opportunity to be part of the decision-makers, using the power of your vote to turn dreams into reality for the players to whom even a month long trial would mean a lot. The Ke Yona Team Search campaign kicked off three months ago with three coaches – Khabo Zondo, Mike Mangena and Shakes Mashaba – identifying raw talent in the different provinces to come up with a final team of 48 for bootcamp. The 48 players are currently in bootcamp at the High Performance Centre, where they were to be trimmed down to a manageable 30 yesterday. The 30 will also be cut back to 23, from which the final 18 will be selected to play against reigning Nedbank Cup champions Free State Stars in September. This is where you, the public, come in. Voting will be open to fans and clients to vote which players get drafted into which of the 16 PSL clubs, where they will spend a month in training. Nedbank sponsorship manager for football properties, Tutu Skosana, confirmed that the voting system will start on 7 July after the first episode of the Ke Yona Team Search, which will air on SABC1 every Sunday at 2.30pm. He said: “At Nedbank we are all about giving people a platform. This year we introduced a new way of drafting players. “This will be done using a USSD code that will be provided when entries open next month. People can vote once. Clubs each get the player with the most votes for that team.”
