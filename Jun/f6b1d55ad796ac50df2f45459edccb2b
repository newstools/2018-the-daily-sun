HER abusive granddaughter made her life a living hell. But then SunPower shone its light on gogo Ellen Mokotong’s suffering. On Monday her granddaughter packed her bags and left the gogo’s house. This was after Daily Sun alerted authorities to the elderly woman’s situation. Ellen’s story was published on Wednesday with the headline: “Grandchild makes gogo’s life hell” Gogo Ellen (79) was at a funeral on Saturday when she was told there were visitors at her home in Atteridgeville, Tshwane. When she got there the mood was sour but her grandchild didn’t verbally abuse her. On Sunday the priest at her church spoke about people’s problems coming to an end. The following day, her granddaughter took all her clothes and moved out. “It was as if I had told God my problems. When I heard she was moving out, I went into the house and thanked the Lord,” she said. She said although it has been barely a week since her grandchild moved out, she could already feel the difference. “ My friends from church say I’m more active now. It feels like a huge burden has been taken off my shoulders.” She thanked the People’s Paper for telling her story. “If it was not for the paper, she would still be here abusing me.” Gogo Ellen said she doesn’t hate her granddaughter. “I hope she changes her ways. I have forgiven her and will never allow myself to hate her. I raised her and hoped that she would become successful but she never valued me,” she said. Gogo Ellen’s son, Raymond Mokotong (56), said his mum will finally live in peace. He said: “I no longer have to worry about whether my mum is safe.”
