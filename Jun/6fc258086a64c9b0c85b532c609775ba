Sunday 17 June is father’s day and an opportunity for everyone to show their appreciation to anyone who has been a father figure to them. Fathers are also very important role players in their children’s lives, but they are given a bad name in society by the ones who fail to take responsibility. The ones that do, however,  have this day dedicated to them, where they are deservedly pampered and honoured by their children. Mzansi celebrities have also taken some time out of their busy schedules to show appreciation to the father figures in their lives in many different heartwarming ways. Others are fathers themselves and have shared some of the messages they have received. Actress and television personality Ntando Duma left the sweetest father’s day message to her baby daddy Junior Da Rocka. “Happy Father's Day to the Father of my Child,” she wrote on Instagram, “you love our daughter and that's enough! If it wasn't for you I wouldn't have known what a super mom is! It is all because of you. I wouldn't trade or exchange you for anything else in the world.” Media mogul Connie Ferguson also took to Instagram to send her best wishes to all the fathers "who go above and beyond for their families." Mafikizolo songstress Nhlanhla Nciza also thanked her husband and the father of her children, Thembinkosi "TK" Nciza for being a "super awesome dad" and her own father for being her "superhero." Check out some of the heartwarming messages your favorite celebrities left for the special father figures in their lives. Happy Father's Day to the Father of my Child...
