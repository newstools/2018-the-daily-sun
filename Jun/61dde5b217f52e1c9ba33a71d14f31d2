THE man who caused the crash that killed Top Billing
presenter Simba Mhere, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison by the Randburg
Magistrates Court. While handing down his sentence, Magistrate David Mahango
said Culpable homicide is a serious crime to commit. 24-year-old Preshalin Naidoo was driving the car that hit Mhere's
car and resulted in the death of Mhere and his friend Kady-Shay O'Bryan. The accident happened on William Nicol Drive in Fourways,
Johannesburg, in January 2015. Mhere's father Joseph was travelling with the two, but he
survived. During the trial, eyewitnesses alleged that Naidoo told them
he could not control his vehicle and that he fell asleep. In Naidoo's plea explanation, he stated that he lost control
of his vehicle due to "unexpected mechanical defects". Mhere rose to fame when he won a presenter search
competition in 2010, landing him a job on the lifestyle television programme.
