IT’S easy to see why big businesses are hesitant to move their stores into Mzansi kasis. This was after another service delivery protest turned violent and looters targeted nearby retail store Pep and fast food outlet KFC. Merchandise and food worth millions of rands were lost in the fury and an ATM was also targeted. The riots took place on Wednesday evening when scores of furious Dube Hostel dwellers in Soweto took to the streets over power cuts. Residents said they hadn’t had electricity for two weeks. The angry looting was the third such incident to occur in the area since 2016. Hostel induna Mqobi Sokhele insisted residents weren’t behind the looting, claiming unnamed local thugs and nyaope boys took advantage of the situation. He said all they wanted was for the mayor and City Power to have a meeting to prevent protests and thugs looting shops. Pep spokeswoman Mariki Schwiebus confirmed their Dube store was looted and added that it had since been closed due to the severe damage caused. “The store had extra security measures such as double shutter doors, cameras and armed response,” she said. Schwiebus said about a million rands worth of damage had been caused during the three incidents. “We sincerely hope the community will respect this in future and not voice their anger and frustration in such a destructive way.” KFC spokeswoman Lebo Sekere couldn’t be reached by the time Daily Sun went to print. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said seven suspects were arrested for public violence and business robbery. “They will appear in the Orlando Magistrates Court today,” he said.
