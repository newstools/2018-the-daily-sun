A YOUNG mum appeared in court this week for allegedly dumping her baby. On Friday, Port Elizabeth cops bust the 24-year-old woman. Colonel Priscilla Naidu said cops arrested her in Kuyga. This is the sixth abandoned baby report in Nelson Mandela Bay Metro since January. The previous case was that of a baby girl found naked by a resident, with her umbilical cord still attached, in a stormwater drain in Lorraine. Naidu said: “A passerby found a three-month-old baby girl lying in a ditch on Friday morning on Draaifontein Road in Greenbushes. A bag and a feeding bottle were lying not far from her. “The man took the baby to the Salvation Army, which then handed her over to cops. “At Kabega Police Station, she received clean clothes. She was cold, with damp clothes. “She was taken to Dora Nginza Hospital and handed over to social workers. “Cops received information from a resident that the mum would visit her aunt in Kuyga. “When she arrived she was arrested. “On Monday she will appear in the St Albans Magistrates Court on a charge of child abandonment.” She said this happens when a parent or guardian either deserts a child without concern for their physical health, safety or welfare, or fails to provide necessary care. The case was postponed to 6 August.
