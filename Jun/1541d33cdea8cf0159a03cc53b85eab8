SCORES of passengers have been left stranded in Alexandra, Joburg, after taxis embarked on a one-day shut down. The Alexandra Taxi Association issued a notice for the one-day shut down. The Association announced that they are striking due to their vehicles being impounded, the petrol hike, and the removal of roadworthy discs. “We want to draw the attention to the Minister of Transport about the ill-treatment to the taxi industry by the government,” the Association said. Commuters woke up to abandoned taxi ranks, and had to make alternative travel routes. JMPD spokesman Wayne Minaar said that the JMPD has impounded more than 500 minibuses during Operation Buya Mthethwa. The operation started in February this year. “These taxis were found to be in a very poor condition,” Minaar said. “Most were unroadworthy with license discs which had expired in 2012. “Some had discs indicating of dish-washer repairs or newspaper clippings.” Minaar also said that despite the strike by the Association, operation Buya Mthetho was justified. “The officers will not stop doing what is expected of them: to protect the commuters from travelling in unroadworthy and unlicensed vehicles,” JMPD Chief David Tembe said.
