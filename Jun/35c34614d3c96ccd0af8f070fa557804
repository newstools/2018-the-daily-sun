THE 23-year-old lovers had just celebrated their third anniversary. Sechaba Tledima and Layla Mayambula had big dreams. But their lives were cut short when they met their end on the road together. On Saturday they were passengers in a car travelling on the N17 towards Orlando, Soweto, when another car crashed into them from behind, killing them instantly. Sechaba’s sister Karabo (28), who lived with him in Honeydew, north of Joburg, said she last saw him when she dropped him off at his old flat. “He wanted to drop off his old access card as he’d just moved in with me. He also wanted to get a haircut and fetch his girlfriend.” When Sechaba did not return, she became worried. She WhatsApped and called him. He did not come home the next day either, so she went to Layla’s home – but neither she nor Sechaba was there. She then rushed to the police and a missing persons case was opened. Accompanied by her dad, she searched for her brother at hospitals and mortuaries. Then she received a shattering call – she must come and identify a body. Cops told them the couple had been killed. Captain Hitler Ngwenya said a case of culpable homicide was opened. Ngwenya said the driver of the other vehicle was arrested at the scene.
