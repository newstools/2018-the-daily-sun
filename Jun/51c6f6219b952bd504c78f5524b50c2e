A video showing the son of the late musician Robbie Malinga living large is doing the rounds of social media. In the video, the young Malinga shows off his expensive attire. He first tells a person who is spraying perfume on him to "hit me more...let me smell good..i want to feel the roses". He then touches his sunglasses and says "It's too much now...it's Dolce and Gabanna and i'm the only one in the country who's got this....it's too much". Next he shows off his expensive pair of shoes and says "It's too much... Christian Louboutin...stepping on the heels". He then turns to his suit before showing off his watch and say "it's too much...Breitling...you gotta tell the time in style...let's go". The video received mixed reactions on Twitter. Some said he should still be morning his father while other said he'd be broke by December. @Leemoleko tweeted: "So his mother is permitting his behavior? Tjo I would deal with him accordingly after losing my husband like that." Letlolo tweeted: "Lefu La hao la mphedisa vibes". Guys Robbie Malinga Jr is a whole mood ????????
