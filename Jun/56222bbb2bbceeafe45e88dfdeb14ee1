IT’S been close to a month since Nomsa Maduna from Mofolo in Soweto was killed. After the suspect appeared in the Protea Magistrates Court, the case was postponed to this week. But on Tuesday, the magistrate apparently arrived late and postponed the case to yesterday, when it was again postponed, to 4 July. Nomsa’s twin brother, Themba Mazibuko, said they felt as if no attention was being paid to his sister’s case. “We decided to get support from different organisations and yesterday the court was packed.” He said they needed support because they knew how the law worked. “If there’s no attention from the community and the media, the culprit can bribe his way out easily. “But if everybody is paying attention, it will be hard to do that.” Themba claimed he overheard the suspect’s sister speaking to a cop yesterday. “They didn’t realise I was standing next to them,” he said. “I heard her asking about a bribe and the cop told her it would be hard with so much attention on the case. “That made me happy. My dead sister will get justice. The man shot my sister in broad daylight. What kind of a monster is he?”
