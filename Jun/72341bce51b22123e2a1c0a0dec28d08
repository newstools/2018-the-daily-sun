ALTHOUGH her parents had a hard time accepting she was deaf, Gugu Ntini never had an issue with it. The 29-year-old from Zwelibomvu in Mariannhill, eThekwini said she was born deaf. She said her mum was only told by a social worker when she was five years old that she would never hear. “This came after several tests were done as my mum had hoped I would eventually hear. This was new to her as her other child didn’t have this problem.” Gugu said being deaf wasn’t easy because people laughed at her while she was growing up. “But I stayed positive and I now want to set a good example to other young women with the same disability as me.” Gugu went to the VN School for the Deaf in Newlands East and matriculated in 2009. “In 2012, I studied teaching at Unisa but I dropped out because I couldn’t pay my fees. My parents are unemployed,” she said. In 2016 and last year, she studied social auxiliary work at the Blind and Deaf Society in Durban. “As a deaf person, there are challenges I often encounter. Some private companies, clinics and hospitals don’t have people who know sign language,” she said. “Some deaf people don’t know how to write things on paper so it becomes difficult to communicate. “Sign language should be learnt by everyone to accommodate us.” Gugu said she had a great love life as she was engaged to a man who was also deaf. “My boyfriend has a wife and he will soon make me his second wife. “I don’t have children but I know I will have many children after we get married.”
