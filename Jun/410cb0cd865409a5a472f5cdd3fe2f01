Radio veteran, Bob Mabena’s radio career is approaching the 30-year milestone. Having begun his radio career in 1989 at Radio Bop, the iconic broadcaster has become a household name and has earned himself a pretty lucrative career. These days, Bob has built himself a very comfortable lifestyle with his life’s work. And as is often the case with media personalities, people tend to forget that they too had to work for their riches. The 59-year-old Power FM host and Group Head of Programming at MSG Afrika recently opened up about his very humble beginnings. Bob was speaking to Nomuzi Mabena on a recent episode of V Entertainment when he said that his first pay cheque came from a job as a stock-taker. “I did stock taking at the OK Bazaars in Pretoria CBD. I think it was about R200,” said Bob. Bob was responding to a question that came from a viewer via Twitter asking if he remembers his first pay cheque.
