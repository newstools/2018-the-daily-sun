England captain Harry Kane scored a match winning brace to break Tunisian hearts in their opening World Cup clash in Volgrogad. Tunisia seemed to have earned a hard fought draw until Kane broke their stubborn resistance at the death. The Three Lions, who are yet to lose a World Cup game against an African opposition, came out of the blocks quickly in the first half grabbing the lead in the 11th minute through their captain and talisman Kane. The striker was on hand for a simple tap in after Tunisia keeper Mouez Hassen produced a fine save to deny John Stones. The keeper had to be replaced by Farouk Ben Mustapha shortly after with an injured left shoulder. However, Tunisia were not deterred and clawed their way back into the game, managing to get back level through a Ferjani Sassi penalty in the 35th minute. England went into the half time break the better side and perhaps unlucky not to have been ahead on the scoreboard. The second half saw the Eagles of Carthage tighten up at the back and frustrating England. But Just as Egypt had found out in their game against Uruguay on Friday, it is not over until the fat lady sings. Tunisia would also have their hearts broken just when they thought they had done enough to secure a point. Kane ghosted in at the back post to head in from close range, ensuring England secured all three points. Kane has now scored 15 goals in 25 appearances for England, the only player to score more for England in their opening 25 games was Gary Lineker with 20. TheÂ  2-1 defeat for Tunisia meant that none of the African sides taking part in this year's showpiece have been able to avoid defeat. All eyes are now firmly on Senegal as they take on Poland tomorrow with African hopes on their shoulders. Meanwhile, Egypt will be looking to get all three points when they take on hosts Russia in the second round of Group A fixtures. The Pharaohs will be buoyed by the availability of their star man Mohamed Salah.
