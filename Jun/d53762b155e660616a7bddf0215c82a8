A LONE man who singlehandedly stopped tanks during the
historic protests in Tiananmen Square, China, is today being remembered around
the world. Twenty-nine years ago, the unknown man blocked the path
of a line of at least 14 tanks as they made their way to confront protesting
Chinese students, workers and others, demanding democratic reforms. Tank Man was only carrying a shopping bag in each hand
when he courageously faced down and halted the military vehicles. The dramatic moment took place the day after a massacre
on 4 June 1989 that shocked the world. According to The
Guardian, on 4 June 200 000 soldiers crushed the protest movement, killing
hundreds or possibly thousands of civilians. The fate of Tank Man is unknown.
