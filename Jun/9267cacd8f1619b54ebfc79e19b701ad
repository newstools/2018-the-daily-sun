AFTER Jan Lefawane died at Lephalale Hospital two weeks ago, his family started making funeral arrangements. Then on Saturday they suffered a second horror when they found the body delivered to the family in Steiloop, Rebone Village in Mokopane, Limpopo, was not Jan! It is now believed his body was buried two weeks ago by another family in Shongwane Village, outside Lephalale. Jan’s sister Miriam Motadi (46), said their pastor advised them not to open the coffin when it arrived on Friday but to wait for the mourners. She said they held a church service the whole night and were shocked when they opened the coffin the next morning. “This is a mistake made by the undertaker. “He first showed us the wrong corpse when we went to fill in forms for the death certificate. We told him it was not right and he then showed us the correct one.” Miriam said when they spoke to the funeral parlour owner about the mistake, he promised to build a tombstone for Jan for free. But they will be taking legal action. Jan’s older sister, Lea Otsweleng (66), said: “Our relatives came from far to bury my brother and they had to go home without taking him to his final resting place.” The undertaker declined to comment.
