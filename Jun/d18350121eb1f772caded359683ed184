NICOLAS Mpfuom (32) from Zwelihle in Hermanus, Western Cape, doesn’t regret coming to Mzansi. “When I arrived in the country, I knew things won’t be easy and that I needed to work hard to look after my family,” said Nicolas, who’s originally from Zimbabwe. He started out as a till operator at Spar but later quit to start his own business. “I wanted to be my own boss,” he said. Nicolas runs a fruit and vegetable stall and sells juice. “I decided not to complain but to work hard to get what I wanted,” he said. “I’m glad I took that decision because now I can take care of my family.” He said his fruit and vegetable prices range between R10 and R16, and he charges R80 for a five-litre juice. “I know people aren’t working and don’t have money, so that’s why my fruit and vegetable prices are reasonable.” Customer Sicelo Manzini (36) said Nicolas’ sells fresh veggies. “Now we don’t have to travel far to buy fruit and vegetables,” said Sicelo. “We’re happy that Nicolas is just around the corner.” He said Nicolas is always smiling and gives the best customer service. “When you go to his stall, he’ll start by having a conversation with you.”
