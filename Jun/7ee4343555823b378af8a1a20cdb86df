A POLICE constable said he was traumatised after being subjected to a strip search in front of colleagues and a suspect. The 30-year-old constable stationed at Dobsonville cop shop in Soweto said the trouble started when they pulled over a car last month. He said there were two people in the car. According to the cop, nyaope and money wrapped in plastic was seized after the car was searched. He said they only took the driver to the police station and when they arrived, the passenger was there with his wife and their station commander. “The wife accused us of stealing cash. My colleagues and I tried to defend ourselves but the commander told us to shut up and instructed us to strip.” He said two women officers were strip searched as well. “When we were left in only our underwear, the commander asked the wife whether she was satisfied. She said no and we were made to take off our underwear.” Peter Ntsime of the South African Policing Union demanded that the commander be sacked. Police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said the investigation into the matter is at an advanced stage.
