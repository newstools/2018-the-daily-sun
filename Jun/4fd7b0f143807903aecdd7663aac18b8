LEON Moyo’s family were shocked when his body was found near a dump site in Zandspruit near Honeydew, north of Joburg. Leon had been killed in the early hours of Sunday morning. Witnesses claim he was dragged from a nearby tavern to the dump site after he was involved in a fight over dagga. They say Leon’s attackers moered him before they burned him to death. “The attackers fabricated a story about him wanting to steal a battery from a truck that was stuck at the dumping site,” said one resident. When the community heard the allegations about a fight over dagga, they got angry and closed down the tavern. “We are not going to keep a tavern such as this in our community,” said another resident. The tavern has not opened its doors since the incident took place. Police spokesman Captain Balan Muthan said a case of murder was opened. He said three men, including the tavern owner, will appear in court soon. Muthan said that Leon’s body was found close to a truck at the dump site. Raphael Moyo (60), Leon’s father, said he was devastated by his son’s death. “He was an obedient child. His death saddens me,” said the madala. “Why would they kill my child like an animal? “What sin did he commit to die like this? I wish the people who killed Leon will rot in jail.”
