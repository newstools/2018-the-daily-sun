MARAH Louw has been staying with her mum ever since recovering from surgery. But it has turned out to be quite an eventful time. The famous singer and actor has decided to do some renovations at her parents’ house in Mzimhlophe, Soweto. She built a wall, installed doors and repainted the house. That seems to have attracted some unwanted attention. Last Sunday her daughter, Lerato Louw, found two beer bottles filled with what looked like black muthi at the gate. She emptied the bottles down the drain, but the next day there was another bottle at the gate, also filled with what looked like muthi. Once again, Lerato threw the bottle away. Then on Thursday night, neighbours saw a young woman, singing and dancing, putting something on the gate of Marah’s mum’s house. She also left a closed container with a stone on top of it. She was confronted by the neighbours and they called Marah. “She said she had been sent to take my luck,” Mara told the SunTeam. Neighbours wanted to teach the woman a lesson, but she was saved by a neighbour who begged them not to give her a beating. Marah told Daily Sun she was at her parents’ house because the stairs at her own home made things difficult because of her hip replacement. “I grew up here and I like spending time at my parents’ house. Why would someone decide to cast a spell on me? “Maybe this is a person who was just playing,” she said. She said she had never used muthi in her life. “Everything I have is through God. “That is why I will not entertain this,” she said. Sangoma Jabulani Mthimkhulu said that even if Marah and her family did not believe in witchcraft, they should sometimes get a traditional person to strengthen their home so that people who try their luck do not succeed.
