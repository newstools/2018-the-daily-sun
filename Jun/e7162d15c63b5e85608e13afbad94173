SCAMSTERS who used sick people to beg for money have been bust for fraud. According to Punch, cops arrested four men on Monday in Lagos for pretending to belong to an NGO that helps the sick and disabled. The conmen allegedly identified sick people out of town and then bought them to Lagos, promising to help raise money to get treatment. But instead, they put the sick people on the streets to beg for money – and then used the cash for themselves! Cops acted on a tipoff from a registered NGO. The Commissioner of Police in Lagos, CP Edgal Imohimi, said: “Detectives found one Jacob Monday from Obi Local Government Area of Benue State who said that the so-called NGO brought him to Lagos under the pretence that they will assist him in raising money to tackle his health challenge. “They promised to help him secure fund for a hernia operation but ended up putting him on the streets of Lagos to beg for money for the past three months. “The worst is that all the money realised from the begging activity was given to the group leaders who lodged in hotels. “However, painstaking search for the group heads led to the arrest of one of the leaders and three other associates.” Imohimi said charges against the four scamsters would be finalised once their investigation is complete.
