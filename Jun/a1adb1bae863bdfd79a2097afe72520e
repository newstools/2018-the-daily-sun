Three officials from the SA Revenue Service were offered a
bribe of US$30 000, about R390 000 by passenger they had apprehended at OR
Tambo International Airport on Tuesday. The officials turned it down. In a statement on Friday, SARS said the passenger, who was
travelling to Dubai, was removed from his flight before take-off for
questioning after he was flagged by the tax agency's risk unit. "On the way to the customs search area, he repeatedly
offered the two customs officers 'bundles of currency' in return for allowing
him to leave with his backpack. Both refused this request." After they were joined by a customs manager in an interview
room, the passenger "again offered them all bundles of currency in order
to secure his release". The entire interaction, including the searching of his bag
which contained R4m, was captured on CCTV cameras. A criminal case has been lodged with police for attempted bribery,
false declaration and failure to declare. The passenger was remanded into
custody. SARS said in a second incident on the same day, two
additional passengers bound for Dubai were intercepted at the same airport for
being in possession of undeclared currency. A search of one of the passengers uncovered the equivalent
of more than R600 000 in US dollars and Pakistani Rupees hidden in his laptop
bag. A case has been opened with police.
