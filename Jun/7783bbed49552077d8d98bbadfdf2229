KAIZER Chiefs’ No 1 goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune has promised their supporters and the Amakhosi family that they will do better as a team next season to make up for their 2017-18 campaign. “It was a tough season for the team but I’m grateful for my contribution,” said Khune, the 2017-18 Absa Premiership Goalkeeper of the Season. Khune’s father, Elias, collected his award at the PSL Awards ceremony held at the Sandton Convention Centre. “Thank you to my teammates, supporters and family for their support throughout the season,” acknowledged Khune. The shot-stopper kept 16 clean sheets, conceding 18 goals in his 27 league appearances this season. He broke his own record of 15 clean sheets achieved during the 2013-14 season. His teammate, Itumeleng Shopane, collected the Player of the Tournament award for the inaugural MultiChoice Diski Shield. Shopane played in all five matches, resulting in Chiefs’ Reserves clinching the winners’ medals after beating Mamelodi Sundowns in the final. Shopane scored one goal in the process. “I appreciate this award,” the elated striker said. “I wish to pass on my gratitude to the entire Amakhosi family for their support during the course of the season. Most of all, I want to thank my own family, in particular my mother and brother, for their support.”
