HIS girlfriend has dumped him, his health has gone
downhill, and he’s terrified by the strange things that keep happening around
him. Ed Booker (37) blames his woes on the 2 metre-tall ghost
he says followed him from a recent exorcism he was part of to his home in Worthing
in the south of England. Heartbroken Ed told The
Mirror: “This ghost is ruining my life. My ex was attacked and pinned down.
I’ve had mediums come in and they’ve been attacked too. “I’ve woken up with painful scratches down my arm. I feel
like I’m in real danger. “It has destroyed
my relationship, my health is still suffering quite a lot. “I’m always depressed; once I get out of the house I perk
up but my mood drops as soon as I go back in. “I don’t know why it seems to want me.” Ed says he and his friends saw this massive shadowy
figure walking around his flat dressed all in black with a big top hat and a
spade resting on its shoulder. “It was just staring at us with a grin full of dirty,
broken teeth. “It was an awful experience really. You never dream of
something like this happening but it is real and it can happen,” said Ed. Terrified Ed, who has a deep interest in the
supernatural, says he’s even seen the word “DIE” suddenly appearing on the
inside of his window and is woken by weird scratching sounds in the middle of
the night. Barry Guy of the Ghostfinder Paranormal Society told The Mirror: “Demons are there to ruin
your life - he will be tormented by it, made to fear it. “Demonic entities are tough to get rid of. It sounds like
he needs an exorcism himself.”
