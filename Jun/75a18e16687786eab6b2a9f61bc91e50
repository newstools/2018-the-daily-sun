THABO Motheletsi told Daily Sun his life has been hell since
Lolly the tokoloshe moved in. Thabo claims that whenever he finds a girlfriend, the
relationship doesn’t last. The 39-year-old from Caleb Motshabi kasi in Mangaung is
looking for a woman and he is also looking for a strong sangoma. “I want a sangoma who can fight against this curse,” he
said. “Most of the woman I meet claim there is a scary short woman
in heels who comes to them when we share the bed and tells them to leave.” And when he’s alone, the short hairy creature that calls
itself Lolly comes and pokes him, he claims. “It doesn’t give me rest. I can’t fight it because it’s too
strong,” he said. “I live with my parents and they are old. I’m worried they
might not live to see their grandchildren.” He said sangomas gave him muthi but nothing worked. “I was told someone who is jealous of me got me married to
the tokoloshe.” One of Thabo’s ex-girlfriends said: “I met Thabo at the
local tavern and I liked him. But after we arrived at his place I was chased
away by something that looked like a woman wearing a lot of make-up. I left
immediately.” Sangoma Kingsley Maboe said: “For the tokoloshe to go away,
the man needs to be cleansed with two chickens – one white and another black –
at a river. He will never be happy with a woman until the tokoloshe is chased
away.”
