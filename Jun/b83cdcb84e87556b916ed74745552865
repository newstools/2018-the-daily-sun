THE horror murder of Gabisile Shabane (13) is causing her grieving family a lot of suffering. On Friday, the Witbank Magistrates Court heard that the DNA test results would take a long time. Senior prosecutor Fani Mavundla reported that the laboratory is struggling because Gabisile was forced to drink beer spiked with brake fluid, making it very difficult to carry out the tests. But he said the DNA results of her severed head have been completed, along with those of her nephew, 15-month-old Nkosikhona Ngwenya. Speaking during the accused’s fifth appearance, Mavundla also told the court another murder accused, Mfanasibili Gamedze, was on trial in Swaziland. He said the National Prosecuting Authority has made an application to have Gamedze deported. He said no specific date for his arrival had been set. “Police have made significant progress in the case, as we are closer to getting everything needed for the case to go on trial. “Hopefully by August, all investigations by the police will be finalised,” Mavundla said. Gabisile, an albino, and Nkosikhona were kidnapped from their home in Hlalanikahle, Emalahleni in January. They were abducted after a break-in at their home while they were sleeping. Nkosikhona’s body was found along the N4 highway and Gabisile’s body was found in the bush near Cullinan, east of Tswhane in February. Thokozani Msibi (32), Brilliant Mkhize (26), Knowledge Mhlanga (22) and Themba Thubana (36) appeared on Friday. Gabisile’s mum Annah Shabane (50) said it is very painful for the family to have to wait to bury their loved ones. The case has been postponed to 14 August for investigation.
