A CANADIAN nurse convicted of murdering eight elderly patients
admitted in her confession that she resolved to kill them because “I was
feeling angry”. According to BBC,
Elizabeth Wettlaufer (50) was convicted of killing eight patients in nursing
homes between the ages of 75 and 96 over a seven year period starting in 2007. She was finally bust in October last year when she
voluntarily checked into a Toronto hospital and confessed her crimes to doctors
(read her confession here). Besides the eight murders, she was also convicted on four
counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated assault in her court
case in June last year. She was sentenced to life in prison last year with no
chance of parole for 25 years.Friends and family of her victims said they had had no idea that their loved
ones had been murdered, since they assumed they had simply died of old age. Wettlaufer would inject insulin – the drug used to treat
diabetics. If injected into a healthy person, it can be deadly. A public inquiry began this week in Toronto to better
understand how Wettlaufer could have got away with it, especially since she had
resigned under shady circumstances from several nursing homes. According to The
Globe and Mail, she was fired four months into her first job after trying
to kill herself with stolen tranquilisers. In another instance, she was fired from a nursing home
for giving patients the wrong medicine – because she was high on drugs herself. Yet she continued finding employment at different nursing
homes.
