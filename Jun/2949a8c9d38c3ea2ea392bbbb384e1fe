ANGRY Simanyene squatter camp residents went on the rampage on Wednesday. They closed down Onverwacht Road with burning tyres and rubbish. The residents of the area in Lwandle were angry when they woke up to find their houses flooded on Tuesday. They blamed the municipality for not clearing a blocked canal nearby. “If the canal was cleared as we had asked, we wouldn’t be walking in water in our houses,” said Noxolo Silala. A digger was sent to clear the canal and after many hours of working, the driver was tired. He wanted to take a break and eat but residents held him hostage. They jumped on the machine and told the driver he wasn’t going anywhere. “If we let him go now he will not come back. We don’t trust him,” said a resident. Another digger was sent to clear the canal and the driver was finally allowed to take a break. Street committee member Fura Manzi said: “We had to force the municipality to do the right thing. It was unfortunate that we had to hold the driver but we are tired of living like this.” Last month the residents held a meeting where they decided to remove shacks that prevented the digger from entering the area. But even after they removed the shacks, the area was not cleaned. The canal was finally cleared on Wednesday evening. Traffic officer Richard Coleman confirmed the protest.
