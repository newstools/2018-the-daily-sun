In what many might not have seen coming, Zion Christian Church (ZCC) member Solly Moholo has reportedly jumped ship and joined prophet Bushiri. Moholo has allegedly found an unlikely ally in Prophet Sheppard Bushiri and has joined his Enlightened Christian Centre Church in search of "spiritual support." "In him I saw how big God is," Moholo told Sunday World. "He is an amazing angel of God. He will help me spiritually and give me support to deal with my challenges." According to the publication, The gospel star is set to receive a special welcome by reverend Holy Joe along with the entire congregation. This comes after Moholo's relationship with the ZCC's leadership reportedly soured after he allegedly violated some of the church's laws. Moholo, who has described prophet Bushiri as "an angel of God," joins the likes of Mamelodi Sundowns midfield ace Tiyani Mabunda as some of the prominent faces at the Enlightened Christian Centre.
