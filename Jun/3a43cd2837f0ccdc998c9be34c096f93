WHEN the rabaki knocked violently on his girlfriend’s door on Saturday, the woman refused to open. The angry man then allegedly broke a window and kicked down the door before storming into the shack armed with a broken bottle. But the woman was ready for him and she allegedly stabbed him after he threatened her with a broken bottle. The man died on the spot at his girlfriend’s place in Tembisa’s Esselen Park, Ekurhuleni. The woman was arrested by cops. Angry neighbours said, however, that the police were wrong to bust the woman because she had stabbed the man in self-defence. A neighbour said: “We know that the man was violent because he often fought with his girlfriend for no reason. We believe he wanted to kill the woman with the broken bottle. “The man broke things in the woman’s shack. What is even worse is that he didn’t even look after the woman. “He was just a rabaki.” When the SunTeam visited the shack, a TV, big mirror and a few other things were seen broken. “The rabaki was abusive and he would assault his girlfriend in front of everyone. Kasi people knew all about it,” said the neighbour. Police spokesman Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha said a woman (37) was arrested for allegedly murdering her boyfriend (36). “The suspect will appear in the Tembisa Magistrates Court soon.”
