Knitted jerseys are always a huge must during the months of winter. A knitted jersey is a jersey made primarily from cotton wool and has been knit using a method which has been manipulated to create a textile or fabric. Cotton wool knits can be found in jerseys, scarfs, hand gloves, beanies and blankets. Knitted jerseys are a great way to stay warm in winter, and are really an investment because they are timeless. Knitted jerseys come in different colours and fabric patterns to choose from. See pictures below of knitted jerseys:  Hello. My name is Denise. I enjoy making things with my hands. I've started this page to connect with other makers, to document my makes, and to hopefully learn some cool new stuff on the way. This year I've knit 8 garments and it's only June! I love them all and wear them every day. My goal is to make a completely #handmadewardrobe, and then expand to #handmadehome items. As you can see, my palette is neutral. I don't stray very far except for the occasional dabble into olive green ????. I enjoy working with natural materials too. If this aesthetic appeals to you, then please give me a follow and join me on this journey of learning to make the things we need and use the most.
