A NUMBER of kasis in Ethekwini look like a pigstyes because rubbish collectors are on strike. Some of the affected areas are Umlazi, Newlands West and Siyanda. The rubbish collectors claim they were not paid last month. On Monday Daily Sun reported that residents of Siyanda were worried the rubbish would make them sick. After the article was published, rubbish collecters called the SunTeam and said they could not work for free because they had mouths to feed. One rubbish collector said: “We want to show the municipality we are also important. “If we do not collect rubbish, kasis become filthy.” Another rubbish collector said he was over the moon when he was hired in December. However, he said he did not realise he would sometimes have to work for free. “Every month, I pay a taxi owner to transport my child to school. “I could not do that last month because I wasn’t paid. “The taxi owner has been merciful to me, but I fear his patience will run out soon.” Municipal spokesman Mandla Nsele said the municipality will find another way to collect rubbish until the strike has ended. “We were not aware of the rubbish collectors’ grievances, but we will see if we can come up with a solution,” Nsele said. “If they were not paid, we will resolve that matter.”
