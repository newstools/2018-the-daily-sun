ALL they want to do is keep poor people warm in winter. Letta Malala (56) and her son Reikhutsitse are the brains behind the Di Chomi campaign. The good Samaritans from block BB in Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, donate clothes and food parcels to the less fortunate. Reikhutsitse said they had only planned to help nyaope addicts in Mabopane. But when residents donated more clothes than he and his mum expected, they decided to help the entire community. “After we donated clothes to addicts, I started receiving messages from my Facebook friends. They told me they also had stuff to give away,” said Reikhutsitse. He said some of the clothes donated by his friends were for children “I asked my friends if they knew any infants I could donate to. Lots of messages poured in. I didn’t know there were so many poor people in my community. Letta said she is happy to help the needy. “Our donors help people they have never seen. They take pictures of themselves and we show it to the recipients,” she said. “The beneficiaries also take pictures of themselves receiving the donations. This is done to create new friendships.” Letta said they are planning to open a soup kitchen where donors will meet beneficiaries.
