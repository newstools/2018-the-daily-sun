THE National Commissioner of Police, General Khehla
John Sitole has condemned the killing of two officers over the past three days. On Monday morning, a 43-year-old Reservist Constable
and a Warrant Officer responded to a complaint at Section H, Ekangala near
Bronkhorstspruit. “On arrival at the scene the Constable approached
four men to make inquiries. Instead, the men fired several shots at the
constable and he succumbed to his wounds,” Police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu
Naidoo said. In a separate incident, on Saturday, a police
Sergeant was killed when he arrived home from work at Paynville in Springs. According to Naidoo, the officer was off duty but
still in his full uniform when he was killed. “The suspects fled the scene without taking
anything.” Sitole condemned the continuous heartless attacks
on our police officers. "The attacks on our police officers are
continuing unabated and I have reiterated to our men and women in blue not to
fall with their guns," Sitole said. "I have also tasked that a specialised team be
mobilised to track and bring those responsible to book," added General
Sitole.
