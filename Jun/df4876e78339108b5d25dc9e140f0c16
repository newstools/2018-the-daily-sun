SOTHO poet Sekhobo Moshe (27) started writing when he was only 13. But it took a long time before he was discovered. “When I started it was difficult,” he said. “I struggled to publish my first book but didn’t give up.” Then he met Angie de Wee from De Wee Production, who helped him reach for his dreams. “I’m now a recognised author and poet,” he said. He said writing a manuscript was easy. “Going through editors and publishing to turn it into a book is the tough part,” said the young man from the Bloemfontein CBD. Sekhobo published Monokotshwai, his first book of poems, in 2015. It’s available in audio book format. The book is a combination of poems that motivate people, especially the youth, to avoid drugs and falling pregnant. He also inspires them to go to school. “It also has poems which unite people and fight xenophobic attacks,” he said. “It has praise poems that honour legends such as Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo and Hector Pieterson.” He received an award as the Sotho Poet of the Year last year at the Macufe Festival. “I present poems on Lesedi FM and I’m studying marketing at the Central University of Technology.”
