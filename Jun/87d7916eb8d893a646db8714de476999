COMMUNICATIONS Minister Nomvula Mokonyane has set her sights on renewing public broadcasting. Yesterday, Mokonyane announced in Tshwane that her department aims to start a public broadcasting review. She said it remains an important source of information, knowledge and entertainment for most citizens. “This underlies the importance of public broadcasting in South Africa as a developing country. “The process will begin with the review of the public broadcaster and the frameworks that govern it,” she said. Mokonyane said the department had already issued a notice inviting stakeholders to submit issues for consideration about its mandate, funding model, including TV licence fees, governance and accountability. She said the SABC is on a gradual recovery path after its near collapse. Madoda Mxakwe was appointed group CEO, while Yolande van Biljon was handed the job of keeping finances under control. She said a joint team of her department, National Treasury and the SABC, led by a turnaround specialist are trying to fix the leaking ship the SABC has become. She hopes to restore the broadcaster’s performance and ability to sustain itself. Mokonyane’s said the urgency is spurred on by next year’s elections, as she found that many South Africans, especially in rural areas, rely on the public broadcaster for information.
