A FIVE-YEAR-OLD girl has died in a shack fire in Masakhane squatter camp in Nomzamo, Strand. According to her father, Onesimo Sothondoshe (31), the fire started just before 3am on Sunday. “I am not sure what started it. “My wife woke me and said something was wrong. When I checked, I saw a fire had already started,” said Onesimo. His wife, Nokubona (29), took their youngest child, as well as a towel, outside.“We went out and I thought the towel was Linathi, but when I asked my wife where she was, she told me she thought I had taken her,” he said. By then it was already too late for the family to rescue Linathi. Her daughter’s death has affected Nokubona badly. “I am not okay,” she said. fighting tears. “I realised only when we were outside and it was too late that my child was left behind.” Pastor Linda Mdolomba from Every Nation Zola Church came as soon as he heard. “I know the father of the child, and as a church, when such a tragedy happens we should be there to offer support,” he said. The church donated toiletries to the family and said they would also provide them with blankets and clothing. Linathi’s uncle, Samkelo Sothondoshe from Philippi, was also shocked. “I was with all of them last week and Linathi was very close to my children. I was her uncle and I will miss her.” Cape Town Fire and Rescue spokesman Theo Layne said: “The service responded to a fire at Masakhane in Strand at 3.36am on Sunday. One informal structure was reportedly destroyed and one child sustained fatal burns. Two fire engines, a water tanker, rescue vehicle and 14 firefighters were sent to the scene.” Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said Lwandle cops are investigating. “An inquest case docket has been opened by Lwandle police after a five-year-old girl died in a shack fire in Masakhane.”
