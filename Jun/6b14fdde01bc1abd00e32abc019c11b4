DEPUTY President David Mabuza said the nuclear deal was never mentioned during his trip to Russia last month. Mabuza was responding to a question by DA MP Bronwynn Engelbrecht in the question and answer session at the National Council of Provinces yesterday. He said he met Russian President Vladimir Putin, but he had meetings with Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. “In all the discussions, there was no discussion of the nuclear deal. No comments were made about the current or any future agreement.” Mabuza said he went to Russia to congratulate President Putin on his re-election and inauguration. He said they spoke about strengthening the relationships between the two countries, and also discussed the desire of South Africa to acquire a non-permanent seat at the UN Security Council. Mabuza said the results of the meeting where witnessed as Russia voted for Mzansi at the UN recently. Engelbrecht then asked Mabuza if he discussed the methods of political assassinations with the Russians. She said it was in light of the allegations against Mabuza. Council deputy chairman Archibold Nyambi asked Engelbrecht to retract her words. She refused, saying she used the word alleged in her question. Nyambi forced her to rephrase.
