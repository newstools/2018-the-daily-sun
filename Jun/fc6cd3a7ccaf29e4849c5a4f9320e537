 FORMER government employees Grace Mokola (41), Zenzele Mncwane (47) and Skhumbuzo Nkosi (35) appeared in the Nelspruit Regional Court on Wednesday. The three are facing charges of fraud and money laundering totaling R3 million. In 2012, the community of Endlovine Farm applied for renovation funds from the department of rural development and land reform. About R3 million was approved for the project, but the accused allegedly transferred the money into their personal bank accounts. The matter was investigated by the Hawks and the three public servants were eventually arrested. They were found guilty in February. Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said the sentencing proceedings will start on 23 August to allow the defence time for consultation. The 55-year-old is facing charges related to fraud totalling R5 million. Botha was arrested on 25 May last year. She was allegedly part of a network that authorised fabricated garnishee orders from at least five magistrates’ offices in Mpumalanga. Sekgotodi said Botha was paid by businesses who wanted to collect the debt by means of a deduction from the debtor’s salary. The matter was postponed to 2 July.
