MINISTER of Health Aaron Motsoaledi has decided to put an end to co-payments in the Medical Schemes Amendment Bill. Speaking to journalists in Tshwane yesterday, he said medical aid schemes should pay the full cost of patients’ medical bills. “This means medical aids would be responsible for a patient’s medical bill and no patient would ever have to settle a portion of that bill.” Motsoaledi was briefing the media on changes to two bills supported by the cabinet, the Medical Aid Schemes and National Health Insurance bills. He said he aimed to align the schemes with changes which would come through the National Health Insurance the government planned to implement. Co-payments are when medical costs are shared between the medical aid scheme and the member. “The view of government is that this move is doable. The department and various institutions received loads of complaints from members of various schemes about the co-payment of medical costs,” he said. He said the number of complaints justified the amendment. “Information shows that medical aid schemes are holding close to R60 billion that is not being used. “We believe these huge reserves come from high premiums,” he said.
