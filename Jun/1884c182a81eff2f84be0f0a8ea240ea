GOSPEL icon Hlengiwe Mhlaba praised God after cheating death. The award-winning artist told Daily Sun that had God not spared her from the crash after she performed at the We Are One Festival at Bridge City Mall, eThekwini on Sunday, she would be dead today. “I was in a head-on collision with another car while travelling to the Afro Gospel event in Mandeni, northern KZN, with three other people,” she said. She said the driver lost control and cars collided and their went downhill. “Fortunately, it didn’t roll and no one was injured. The car was damaged beyond repair,” she said She said she was in shock after the accident and had gone to see a doctor but was all right. At the festival, Energy Minister Jeff Radebe honoured her for being a bright kasi star. “I’m proud to receive this award,” said Hlengiwe. “It will teach kasi kids never to give up on their dreams because one day they’ll be honoured like me.” Radebe said: “This is to show KwaMashu isn’t as bad as people say.” He said the kasi has produced successful people.
