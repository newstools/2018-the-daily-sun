ANOTHER taximan was shot and killed at the weekend. Vuyisile Mngcokoca (64), vice-chairman of the Border Alliance Taxi Association, was killed in front of his wife, son and mum-in-law in Motherwell kasi on Saturday morning. He was on his way to a funeral when the incident happened. His death follows that of Phathisile Makinana, who was killed twodays later outside the Home Affairs office in the CBD. A memorial service for Mngcokoca was held at Woza Memorial Hall in New Brighton yesterday. Vuyani Mshiywa, president of the taxi association, told mourners: “There’s nothing wrong with the taxi industry in Port Elizabeth. “The problem is here at Border Alliance Taxi Association.  We’re still shocked and saddened by Mngcokoca’s killing. “It’s unbelievable that, in this day and age, people still kill each other when they don’t see eye to eye. “The killing of our members has become a norm. “We shouldn’t point fingers at outsiders. This is an internal problem. “It seems there’s a syndicate operating within our association. “As management and members of the association, we need to ensure no more lives are lost.” Mlungiseleli Mlanjana, the association’s chairman, said: “We lost a great leader who held numerous positions in the association. “He was a respected person in the association.” Family member Vukile Mngcokoca said: “We’d like to thank all the people who share our grief during this difficult time.” Mngcokoca will be buried tomorrow.
