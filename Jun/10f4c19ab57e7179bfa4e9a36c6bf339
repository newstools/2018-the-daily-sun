THE wife of murdered Brigadier Hendrick Mogoerane allegedly gave him muthi to make him pass out before he was strangled. Cordelia Mogoerane (57), a colonel in the SAPS, appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court yesterday to apply for bail in connection with the murder of her husband. Warrant Officer Robbert Mathebula said Cordelia allegedly wanted her husband dead. “She had an issue with the deceased. At some stage it was no secret that she wanted him killed,” said Mathebula. He said Cordelia allegedly consulted Ntombizodwa Dlamini (73), a sangoma, to help her get rid of her husband. She allegedly gave her muthi to kill him. “When muthi did not kill the deceased, Dlamini told her she knew hitmen who could eliminate him,” he said. Dlamini allegedly connected Cordelia with Muziweshinga Zondo, who agreed to do the job. It is alleged that on 16 January Cordelia made her husband drink muthi to knock him out. “She then called Muziweshinga and told him to finish the job,” said Mathebula. Muziweshinga then called Thokozani Zondo, who works as a car guard in Vosloorus hostel, to help him. It is alleged they went to Mogoerane’s house in Kempton Park but could not kill him as he was conscious. Later on the wife called them to say he had passed out again. Muziweshinga allegedly called Thulani Nxumalo, a taxi owner, and Sanele Mphuthi, a driver. “When they got into the house the deceased was sleeping and they strangled him,” Mathebula said. The body was loaded into his own car and dumped. Cordelia said she left her husband watching TV when she went to sleep. The matter was postponed to today for judgment.
