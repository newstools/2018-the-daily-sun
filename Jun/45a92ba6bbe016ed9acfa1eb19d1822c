WHEN the SunTeam visited the troubled VBS Bank this week, it looked like it was pay day. People, especially the elderly, were sleeping on the doorstep of the bank in Thohoyandou, Limpopo, hoping to be first in line to draw some of their savings. The bank first made headlines when it loaned R7 million to former president Jacob Zuma to pay for upgrades to his Nkandla home. It was in the news again three months ago when it emerged that it had serious financial problems. It later came out that several municipalities had invested millions in the bank, against government regulations. Ordinary clients are now also dealing with the fallout. The bank can only allow withdrawals of up to R1000 a day, which is especially a problem for funeral societies. A member of a club that invested over R100 000 said: “We have members whose relatives died. We are helpless and members are always complaining. R1000 is nothing to prepare for a funeral. This has led to funerals not taking place or members borrowing money elsewhere.” Shareholder Wilson Muvhulawa said: “We are aware of hundreds of people coming to the bank every day and we share their frustration. “The bank is under a curator and the decision to have people withdraw only R1000 cannot be changed. I cannot assure them they will get all their money.”
