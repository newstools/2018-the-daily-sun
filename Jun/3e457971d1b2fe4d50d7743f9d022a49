HE got her drunk, kidnapped her, put her cut-up body in
two sacks and dumped them in the river – all because he wanted her car! According to Punch,
Paul Ezeugo (27) was arrested in Abuja, central Nigeria on Wednesday after he
and his accomplice had been on the run since May 2016. Ezeugo, a web designer, told cops that he had met Charity
Chidiebere Aiyedogbon on Facebook and dated her for a year. He claims she told
him she was a divorced mum of four, although it turns out she had a husband,
David. On 9 May 2016, Ezeugo and his accomplice, Emmanuel Adogah
(28) picked Charity up. He said: “We went out with her and we drank and she dosed
off, so we carried her to where we killed her.” They then took her body to a quieter area where they
chopped it into pieces and put it in two sacks, which they later dumped in a
river in Ushafa, 30kms from where they murdered her. Her car, an Acura ZDX SUV, was recovered in Enugu where
Ezeugo had hidden it, nearly 500kms south of Abuja. The car was worth about R400 000. Asked why he murdered the woman, Ezeugo said, “It was the
devil and greed. I was hoping to get her car. I dated her for one year but she
didn’t give me anything, she told me she was a divorcee when we met.” Charity’s heartbroken husband David said he would work
with cops to make sure his wife’s murderers are brought to justice.
