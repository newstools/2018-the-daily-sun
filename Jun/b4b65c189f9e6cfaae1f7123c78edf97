Local rapper Cassper Nyovest is the latest victim of the unforgiving Twitter streets after he failed to bring home a BET Award. The star lost out to Nigeria’s Davido who walked away with the Best International Act award at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles. Instead of congratulating Cassper for even being nominated, which was a feat on its own, people on Twitter have poked fun at him for losing. In true Twitter style, his loss has seen people create hash tags such as #CassperBETdololo and #CassperNyoempty just to tease and make fun of him. However, the rapper did also receive some encouraging words from the ANC's Fikile Mbalula who told him to "keep up the good work and stay focused."
