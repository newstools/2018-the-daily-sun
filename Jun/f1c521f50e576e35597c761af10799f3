With all the big brand releasing their much anticipated products and some of them not being available in our countries, we tend to trust online shopping but is this safer? Shopping for cheap designer make up might put you at risk and with social media playing a big role in this, many of these products are fake and more alarming could leave you with bad side effects. The beauty industry is exploding and with the youth trying to keep up with their beauty idols and catch up with trends, many are taking short cuts. These unregulated fakes can contain a lot of unregulated dangerous ingredients that we don't know of and can cause immense damage. You can get products like eyeshadow palettes, lipsticks, mascaras, eyeliners and more at outside vendors or even online stores. If finding your favorite luxury items with slashed prices seems too good to be true, it probably is. According to Verdict Victory, Consumers are reporting a number of symptoms from using counterfeit makeup, including eye infections, allergic reactions, skin rashes, swollen lips and chemical burns. In worst cases, the toxic ingredients in many fake makeup products have caused long-term health problems such as high blood pressure and infertility. However, most customers are unaware of the harmful side effects until it’s too late. One fake version of a MAC lipstick was found to have 15 times more lead than the original, while a counterfeit Jaclyn Hill eyeshadow palette had four times the amount of lead as the real version.
