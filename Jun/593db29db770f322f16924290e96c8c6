THE scorer of the famous 2010 Fifa World Cup opening game, Siphiwe Tshabalala, says he has no favourite to win the biggest global event currently under way in Russia. Tshabalala, who scored that thunderbolt at the FNB Stadium against Mexico in Group A’s opening game, says he will be glued to his TV set to enjoy the month-long feast of football. If it wasn’t for veteran Mexican midfielder Rafael Marquez’s equaliser that forced Bafana to settle for a 1-1 draw, Tshabalala’s goal would have won the host nation the game. Tshabalala was not willing to pick his favourite nation to lift the trophy in Moscow on 15 July. He insisted he was not good at predictions. The Kaizer Chiefs midfielder say playing in the world football spectacle remains one of his biggest highlights of his career. Tshbalala said: “I have no favourites. I just want to enjoy a feast of football. “The World Cup is big and to have played in it remains the highest honour. “I’ll always remember the goal in 2010 for as long as I leave. I also follow the five African representatives and watch every other game. “I don’t like picking favourites to win the competition.  There are many good teams capable of lifting the trophy. “So, it’s safe not to be drawn on which team are the favourites,” he said. The Bafana star will enjoy his break as the South African Premiership is on a two-month break. Amakhosi finished in third position in the past Premiership campaign. Together with veteran striker Bernard Parker, Tshabalala promised fans that the Soweto giants would bounce back stronger in the 2018/2019 Premiership season. Both of them will be enjoying watching some of the biggest football stars he likes of Argentina’s Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and Paul Pogba of Manchester United compete for top honours in Russia. They promised to reflect  on the past Premiership season. Amakhosi will play against Mamelodi Sundowns  in the Shell Helix Cup pre-season one-day tournament at the FNB  Stadium next month.
