THESE residents say enough is enough. The people of Vastrap squatter camp in Port Elizabeth are demanding proper houses. About 60 squatters marched to the city hall yesterday morning to demand houses from the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. They handed over a petition to municipal officials, demanding to be moved in two weeks’ time. The squatters have been protesting for the past two weeks, saying their area was ruled by criminals who often rob them in broad daylight. Angie Abrahams (54) told Daily Sun: “I have been robbed many times. The criminals rule our area. “They recently broke into my shack and stole my food and valuables. The cops don’t even help us.” Another resident said she was nearly raped on 24 May last year. “I reported the case but the cops did nothing, even though I gave them all the details. “I have a case number but the cops are not doing anything. “We demand to be moved to a safer place with proper houses.” Councillor Vukile Dyele said since the DA came into power in 2016, there has been no development in Vastrap. “People were last moved in 2015 when the ANC was still in power.” The petition was received by Selwyn Willis on behalf of mayor Athol Trollip. He promised to hand it over to the mayor. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said: “The squatters should approach their station commander and detective commander with their complaints so they can be resolved.”
