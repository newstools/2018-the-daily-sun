TWO cops could soon be charged for their alleged involvement in the Glebelands Hostel violence. Although Umlazi cop shop station commander Brigadier Bongi Ntuli would not give details, she told Daily Sun the investigation was at an advanced stage She said the two cops would be arrested soon. The People’s Paper has learnt that the two cops are based in Umlazi. If charged, they’ll join their colleague Detective-Warrant Officer Bhekokwakhe Mdweshu, who was arrested with six others last year. The seven will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court today. The case will be transferred to the High Court. Hostel residents said the arrests will prove they were right all along about dirty cops’ involvement in the hostel killings. They said if former police minister Nathi Nhleko had sent the national intervention unit in 2014, and removed Umlazi cops from the hostel, many lives could have been saved. KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker refused to give details.
