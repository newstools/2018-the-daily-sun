ADVERTS for fake doctors are plastered on nearly all the street walls and lamp posts of Mzansi. These so-called practitioners claim to be able to perform both western and African methods of healing. Traditional healers in the North West are in battle to stop these fake claims. They attended the Reconciliation, Healing and Renewal Summit at the Rustenburg Recreation Centre on Friday. The event started at 12 noon with the welcoming of ancestors, which according to the healers’ knowledge, is the time the ancestors choose to visit. The event lasted for two days. A new body which seeks to find new solutions was elected. Chairman of the new Traditional Healers Forum, Obakeng Mooki, said fake doctors parading as real healers do serious damage to the credibility of traditional health practice. “Traditional healers have been converted into witches,” he said. “We want the dignity and respect afforded our forefathers back. We are healers, not killers.” Acting North West Premier Wendy Nelson was welcomed with a yellow cloth around her shoulders and a traditional hair belt. She said the new forum will deal with issues to pave the way for united traditional healing in the province. She said healers have voiced their concerns about illegal traditional medical treatment given to people. “We need to protect our people against these fake doctors who claim to be able to bring back lost lovers, enlarge your penis and do quick abortions. “We are thankful that dikgosi stand together to fight these social ills that are affecting our communities.”
