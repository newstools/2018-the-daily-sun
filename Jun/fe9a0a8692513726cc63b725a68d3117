THABO Lekalakala is back at work and the workers are not happy. Yesterday chaos was the order of the day when Lekalakala, the man suspended last month as head of department of the North West health department, was back in the office. His suspension came as the result of allegations that Mediosa Health had received a contract worth R34 million for a mobile clinic. Lekalakala and his family also allegedly went on a trip to India, allegedly paid for by the Guptas. According to Nehawu provincial spokesman Patrick Makhafane, they were not on strike but the workers were reacting to “the provocation”. “There is no provincial report to say Lekalakala was cleared. It was surprising to see him back in the office. “We want the full disciplinary process to take place. If Lekalakala is not suspended and charged, there will be more trouble,” said Makhafane. Tebogo Lekgethwane, a spokesman for the health department, said Lekalakala’s suspension ends this month. “The MEC and the administrator had a meeting with the employees this morning. They explained to them that there is a process unfolding to extend his suspension since investigations against him are about to be concluded. “Charges against him were delayed, as more things kept coming up. “This necessitated extension of his suspension.” Lekgethwane said Lekalakala’s suspension will be extended so that investigations can be completed.
