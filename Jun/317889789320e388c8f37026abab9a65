DEVASTATING fires have hit Cape Town kasis again, killing seven people and leaving one badly hurt in two separate incidents at the weekend. Five kids aged between 14 and one year old died in a shack fire at Mesiya squatter camp in Kosovo, Philippi on Saturday morning. The mum of two of the kids was admitted to hospital with serious burn wounds. Neighbour Siphiwo Kosani told Daily Sun: “We heard the mum screaming for help in the early hours of the morning. “When we got to her place we found her shack on fire. “We tried to help but the fire was too strong.” Another neighbour, Welcome Gwangqa (41), said: “It’s hard to say what really happened here. “The major problem is that we don’t have electricity in the area, but the fire might have been prevented if there was power.” President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed his sadness about the incident. “My prayers and thoughts, and those of government and all South Africans, are directed to the families who have been affected by death and displacement at Mesiya squatter camp,” he said. Western Cape police spokesman Frederick van Wyk said: “We can confirm a shack fire in early hours of this morning Saturday morning at the squatter camp. “The cause of the fire is still unknown. Ten other shacks were also destroyed. “No further injuries were reported. An inquest docket has been opened for investigation.” Their mum had allegedly walked a little distance with her friend and when she returned the shack was on fire. Nikiwe Mbutho (43), the aunt of the dead kids, said they were devastated by their loss. “We are heartbroken because we’ve lost two innocent souls.”
