SPECULATIONS over the future of former Orlando Pirates midfielder Andile Jali were finally put to bed on Friday afternoon when it was confirmed that he has joined Mamelodi Sundowns. Jali was a free agent having left KV Oostende in Belgium earlier this year, with the club agreeing to terminate his contract early as he planned a return to South Africa. At the beginning of the week it was a two horse race between Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs for the signature of the Bafana Bafana international. Speaking to Sundowns official website, the 28-year-old said: “I feel good to have signed for Mamelodi Sundowns. At last this deal is done. “It’s been dragging for a long time. Now I can relax before the season starts. I have recovered from the injury, I am good to go. I passed the medicals. Now I am ready for Sundowns to tell me when to come to training.” Jali signed a five year contract with Masandawana which will see him at Chloorkop until 2023.
