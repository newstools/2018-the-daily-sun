AFTER months of abuse at the hands of her taxi driver ex-lover, a 22-year-old woman from Khenani in Nongoma, northern KZN, finally broke her silence on Facebook on Sunday. The emotional post caught the attention of a Nongoma top cop, who then visited the woman and is investigating the allegations. “I’m scared of him,” she told Daily Sun. “I’ll only feel free once he’s behind bars.” “I hope the cops lock him up and throw the keys in the ocean so that he never comes back to hurt me.” She said she’s been abused since February but kept silent for fear of being killed. She said he told her in 2016 when she dumped him that she’d regret it. “But I never took it seriously until February when he klapped me,” she said. “I asked him why he was doing that. “He punched me, dragged me to his car and took me to his house, where he raped me.” She said the man has many cop friends. “I’ve been keeping quiet for so long and have tried to commit suicide by overdosing on pills,” the woman said in her post. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed a case of rape is being investigated by Nongoma cops.
