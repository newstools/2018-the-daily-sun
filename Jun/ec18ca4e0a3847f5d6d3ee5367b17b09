AFTER spending the 2017-18 season playing no competitive football for personal reasons, former Bafana Bafana midfielder Thanduyise Khuboni says he is ready to resuscitate his career. The left-footer was among a host of players who took part in a match to honour the late Orlando Pirates and Bafana shot-stopper Senzo Meyiwa over the weekend. Khuboni says he still has a lot to offer local football: “I know it may sound far-fetched when I say I still have a lot to offer after spending a whole season not playing. Personal circumstances played a huge role in my decision to take a time off from football last season. I did, however, consult with my agent (Mike Makaab) before deciding to take the time off. He understood and has been there for me.” The 32-year-old last played for newly promoted Highlands Park in the 2016-17 season and his last match was a 2-2 draw with Mamelodi Sundowns in May 2017. That season the Lions of the North got relegated to the National First Division. The midfielder, who has played 26 times for Bafana, says he is not ready to call time on his football career. He was also part of the Golden Arrows team that won the MTN8 in 2009 when they trashed Ajax Cape Town 6-0 at Orlando Stadium. “I can’t hang up my boots yet. I still have lots of seasons in me. I’ve kept busy by training with smaller teams and playing a lot of indoor soccer to keep fit. “I know training by yourself is totally different to the real thing. That said, I don’t think I will struggle that much to regain my fitness when I start training with a professional team. My agent is working hard to get me a team, as I am ready to get back on the field,” added Khuboni. The former Mpumalanga Black Aces player says he is ready to play for any team, even in the NFD, as long as he gets to play this season.
