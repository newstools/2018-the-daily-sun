COPS in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, are putting the lives of young ones first. On Saturday, the cops as well as Old Mutual and Tsakane social crime prevention, took part in a child protection awareness and sport against crime campaign. The day started with cops and residents driving around the kasi before stopping at one of the crime hot spots on Toyi Toyi Street, Sindane Park. Parents were urged to look after their kids all the time and not to leave them unattended. Kids were told not to walk alone when going to and coming back from school. Tsakane police spokesman Sergeant Lebohang Ramaesa encouraged residents to lead a healthy lifestyle. He warned young people about the dangers of crime and substance abuse. Ramaesa told Daily Sun: “Crime in general was addressed by the sector manager. “We also distributed pamphlets on children’s rights and general safety tips. “The community was informed about the outpatient drug rehabilitation programmes run by Tsakane cops and the South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence.” He said the day ended with a sporting event at Tsakane Stadium. “The Gauteng Police Football Association hosted a soccer tournament arranged by East Rand Football Association. “Local soccer teams took part in the tournament,” said Ramaesa.
