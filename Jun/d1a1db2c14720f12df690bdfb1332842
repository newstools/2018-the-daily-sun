A HEARTLESS robber nicknamed Twenty was sentenced to 25 years in jail yesterday in the East London Magistrates Court. Zolani Bonani (31) broke into the shack of Nongetheni Mtshini (62) and her daughter Vuyelwa Stofile (23) in 2009 and demanded money. When Mtshini said she had no money, Bonani and his two accomplices assaulted her, stabbed her with a bush knife, and stole R500. She tried to flee but Bonani caught her and cut her fingers. One of his accomplices told her they’d use her and her daughter for muthi. Stofile was stabbed after screaming at the men that she knew who they were. Mtshini had to be hospitalised for six months and her daughter for two weeks. Bonani was found guilty of robbery and assault after the court found his testimony unreliable. He lied about being Stofile’s lover. Magistrate Don Ngoqo didn’t understand why he was charged with assault, not attempted murder. “You attacked people who knew you, who expected protection from you,” said Ngoqo. “You brutally attacked them, defenceless as they were.” Bonani was sentenced to 17 years for robbery and eight for assault. The attack happened nine years ago on a farm near Gonubie, but he was only arrested in February. His two accomplices were never caught.
