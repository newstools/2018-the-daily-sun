HOME Affairs records show Patrick Prince is dead. But the 58-year-old from Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape is still alive and well, and battling to get his ID. The father of four said he was shocked when Home Affairs officials told him in 2016 he was dead. He said he heard the shocking news at the Home Affairs offices in Motherwell. “I had gone there to change my wife’s surname after marrying her in 2016. I paid R280 for reissue of my ID because the one I had been using was damaged,” said Patrick. “I also paid for my wife’s new ID. When we went to the Home Affairs after two weeks to collect our IDs, I was told I had been declared dead. “When I got married, Home Affairs had no details of my so called death. Now they have told me the system shows I’m dead. “I also made an affidavit at the police station to state that I am still alive, but that didn’t help too.” He told Daily Sun he has visited the Home Affairs offices several times, but had no luck. “Last month, Home Affairs officials told me they were still waiting for my fingerprints from the head office in Tshwane, declaring I was back in the system as a living person,” Patrick said. He said he felt like his rights had been taken away from him. Gcinile Mabulu, a manager at Motherwell Home Affairs, asked the People’s Paper to send him Patrick’s details so he could investigate. He promised to contact Patrick as soon as they had investigated.
