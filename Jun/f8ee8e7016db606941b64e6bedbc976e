INKOSI Nsikayezwe Zondi has described his late wife, Nokulunga Ntombela-Zondi, as a pillar of strength to both her family and the people of Mpumuza, near Pietermaritzburg. Nokulunga died on Sunday evening after battling cancer for some time. Speaking at his palace on Tuesday afternoon, Zondi said it was difficult seeing his wife struggling with the illness and doctors trying their best to save her. “In the end we have to accept that God has called her. “Although we still wanted her to be with us, we have to accept what has happened,” he said. Zondi said even though he was saddened by her death, he was glad his wife was no longer in pain. “We’ve been married for 38 years and when I saw her battling in hospital, I wished there was a way her pain could be taken away.” Zondi said her wife started from humble beginnings, selling snacks and sandwiches at schools around Sweetwaters. “She eventually ventured into construction projects, which helped a lot and ensured that the unemployed locals got opportunities which enabled them to earn a living. “She encouraged families to start vegetable gardens and this ensured poverty was dealt with in the area,” said Zondi. Nokulunga was the daughter of former IFP member of the provincial legislature, David Ntombela. On Tuesday, former Msunduzi mayor Chris Ndlela, speaker Babu Baijoo, mayor Themba Njilo and his deputy, Thobani Zuma, visited the family to comfort them. Nokulunga’s brother, Dennis Ntombela, said her sister’s contribution would be felt for many years to come. Nokulunga will be buried on Saturday.
