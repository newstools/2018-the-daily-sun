RESIDENTS of Glebelands Hostel have threatened to march to the offices of mayor Zandile Gumede. Residents of the hostel in Umlazi, south of Durban, are demanding that the mayor fix storm damage that happened last year. The residents told Daily Sun they didn’t know what to do to make the municipality treat them like humans. A hostel leader, who didn’t want to be named, said it was painful to see how residents were neglected by the government. He said as far as he knew, all houses damaged in last year’s storms had been fixed. “We’re now gatvol and we’ll show the mayor we’re residents of eThekwini as well,” he said. “We’ll go and sit in her office until she sends people to fix our buildings.” He said the roofs of five blocks were blown off and the municipality was putting residents’ lives at risk by not fixing the damage. “In her report, the Public Protector recommended that the eThekwini Municipality fix housing problems at the hostel, but nothing has been done since the report came out last year,” he said. The mayor’s spokesman, Mthunzi Gumede, said the municipality would like to apologise to hostel residents for the delay. He said the municipality was in discussion with the provincial and national governments regarding repairs as even areas outside of Durban were affected by the storm last year.
