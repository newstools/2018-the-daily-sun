A 41-year-old man is in a serious condition after he was
repeatedly stabbed and assaulted by his 18-year-old daughter and 42-year-old
wife. It's alleged that the incident began when the victim confronted
his daughter regarding about relationship with a man of a different race. The incident is said to have happened at Tea Estate in Inanda,
KwaZulu Natal. Reaction Unit SA spokesperson Prem Balram said members of RUSA
were called out to an informal settlement where the victim had required help. "Her alleged boyfriend was at the residence with an
unknown man during the confrontation. Without warning the four began assaulting
him," Balram said. Balram further stated that his daughter grabbed a knife and
repeatedly stabbed him before they fled in an unknown direction. According to Balram the victim attempted to walk to the main
road looking for help from the residents at an informal settlement. "Reaction Officers conducted an extensive search for
the suspects however they still remain at large," Balram added.
