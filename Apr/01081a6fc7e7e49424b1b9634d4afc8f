AKHUMZI Jezile’s family says the late television presenter and actor
will be laid to rest on Saturday at the West Park Cemetery. Jezile and four of his friends died in an accident, which included Siyasanga
Kobese, Thobani Mseleni and Skhumbuzo Mbuthuma. "The time has come for us to bid our son, friend and colleague
farewell and celebrate his life while keeping his memory alive," Family
spokesperson Percy Vilakazi said. The memorial service will be held on Thursday, at the Rhema Bible Church
in Randburg, Johannesburg. “We are humbled by the continued outpouring love, support and prayers we
have received to date from all corners of those that were touched by his life," Vilakazi
said. He said even though they are
still dealing with the shock of the loss of Akhunzi, the family is comforted by
the knowledge that Akhumzi loved the Lord. Vilakazi said Akhunzi was
unashamed of the gospel of Christ. "We would like to thank everyone for the support and further
request that you continue to pray for us and afford us the space that we
so desperately need in our time of grief," he said.
