ITS armoured windows and body are able to withstand bullets fired from an AK47. That’s just one of the features of the black Infiniti QX80 which was the Guptas’ favourite ride when their relations with government were in full swing. But now the shiny luxury car –along with an equally impressive black Porsche Cayenne – is gathering dust in the corner of a parking garage of a Sandton office park. Workers at the office park said the two cars were parked there around the time the Guptas were said to have left the country. And they haven’t moved since. A standard Infiniti QX80 sells for about R1,4 million. But the Gupta version is worth considerably more, because of the added security features. It has additional bulletproofing, anti-ballistic glass and run-flat tyres, ballooning the price to almost R3,2 million. Infiniti Melrose, the sole distributors of the Infiniti range in Mzansi, confirmed the car was sold to the Gupta-owned company Confident Concepts in late 2015. The two vehicles are worth an estimated R5 million and form part of a court order obtained by the Asset Forfeiture Unit in April to attach a number of Gupta-linked assets. The assets are connected to the accused in the Vrede dairy farm case and in total are worth an estimated R180 million. The long list of assets includes numerous houses, the most well-known being the one in Saxonwold, as well as cars, coal mines, private jets and helicopters. The order indicated that the accused or any third parties who might be in possession of any of the property sought under the order should hand it over to the law. Clearly, nobody has handed over these two assets yet. – NEWS24
