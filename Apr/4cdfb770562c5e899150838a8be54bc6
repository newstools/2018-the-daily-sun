South Africa Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu), its affiliates and allies in civil society, will embark on a national strike on Wednesday, 25 April. Saftu said it will be protesting against the "biggest attacks on working-class people, the trade unions and the poor majority of South Africans since the end of apartheid". They are protesting against the implementation of a R20 an hour minimum wage and the new Labour Laws. Said Saftu: " South Africa is the most unequal country in the world, in which 10% of the population earn more than 50% of the household incomes while 20% earn less than 1.5%. "\Deloitte accountants have calculated that the average pay of executives in the countryâ€™s top 100 companies is now R17.97 million a year, which amounts to R69 000 a day and R8 625 an hour. "Yet these grossly overpaid tycoons, together with their new champion in Union Buildings, multi-billionaire President Cyril Ramaphosa, want workers and their families to survive on just R20 an hour, something they would never dream of accepting for themselves. "We utterly reject the argument that this bill should be supported because R20 an hour is 'better than nothing'. Saftu said the scandalous fact that so many employers currently pay employees even less than this poverty wage in no way justifies the government agreeing to a statutory minimum which will still leave workers trapped in poverty, entrench the apartheid wage structure, and widen income inequalities even further. "And not all workers now earning less than R20 an hour will get an increase. The minimum wage for farm workers will only be R18 an hour, R15 an hour for domestic workers and as low as R11 an hour for those on Extended Public Works Programmes. And some employers have already said that they will keep their monthly wage bill the same as before by employing workers for fewer hours."
