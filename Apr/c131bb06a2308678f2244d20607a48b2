WOMAN cricketer Ayabonga Khakha is a legend in the making. The 25-year-old Proteas fast bowler from Middledrift, north of East London, said it was hard to compete in a male-dominated sport. Ayabonga started playing cricket when she was seven. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssxxjxdIigXJ-iTpDBOTARvFoKoZYTxIGRyC2tytq2DtAYUKKf8PG2ufJ2hZZxKrmGj85wgSHJOGkHDx-fjePzGxyQojE_haGyB6sIZ4enAFR0uThDQnFde3lmf31GXc7ePKxvBWhcHj81U0gXZ7l5exDdDZFU9xqBC4WNX77EflwBO-Hjph8wrRQmZiaR_oP_mzs5N3zmfDbdsaCxHSZkoKA_hexY4uj3c3AqCKKJso6xqF4gihLThLnopMsc3d3JshZefHyfIEM76XSI9qijyB663A_0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM5dkwW24Wa-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

That was a dream come true.”She said the highlight of her career was taking part in last year’s ICC Women’s World Cup. Ayabonga said women’s sport was finally getting the recognition it deserved. “Women’s sport is growing daily,” she said. “Things aren’t as difficult as they used to be. “Now it’s all about working hard to get what you want. “Provinces are playing well and that’s where people are being selected for the national team. “As a cricketer you have to focus on being a good player, but you can’t neglect your studies.“Getting an education is important because a career in sport is short. “You must have something to fall back on.”
