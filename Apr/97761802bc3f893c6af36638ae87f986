MUM Tendai Sibanda had been looking for her missing son Nelphaus Moyo (22) for more than a week. Little did she know he had been lying dead just a few metres from their flat in Hillbrow, Joburg. His body was found on Tuesday. It appears when the doors of the lift opened after he left his mum’s flat last Sunday, he stepped into a dark void and fell seven storeys to his death.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssySd5aigYZURHcZoRN4LQPVguFLM57Qxg17xiTZ90G_pooa5VbvMJnfX_rfoc9qxKlO2iI4XJLBNkzCnBUOXULgJWF6lDKaI0NKZH57HClUvCUwuZg8OjP5j8tF-R4b6JN6dKdSqmu8B1Hpot4ILAeLHlnY8DOjoR8OpsuNZlu4sQplGDSknbqHKw-RpbgRcInUo3YuzUBkMh_YF9Ozk5xIr1zG5E58Bdc2c2RhL-3qHj5RRC_JbTx36AY9T4xxMo5mLVynzkU88sKHNfZyRetoP6vu3-7\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzD-LVJUaH7mZEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We went to police stations as we thought he might be detained because we’re originally from Zimbabwe. But there was no sign of him.” Residents told Daily Sun they had reported the faulty lift to the building owner several times. “He’s careless and only cares about rent money. He should be jailed,” said Simon. When contacted for comment, the building owner hung up the phone. Sergeant Mduduzi Zondo, Hillbrow cop shop spokesman, said an inquest docket has been opened. The family is pleading for help with the burial costs.
