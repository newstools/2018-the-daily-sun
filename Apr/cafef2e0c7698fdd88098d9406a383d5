A MAN appeared in the Eerstehoek Magistrates Court on Friday for dealing in dagga. The 33-year-old from Elukwatini, Mpumalanga was bust after cops’ suspicions were aroused by the bag he was carrying. Police spokesman Sergeant Peace Mbokane told Daily Sun: “The man was carrying a brown bag and looked suspicious to patrolling cops. “When they asked him what was in the bag, he just dropped it and ran away. “The police chased him until he was caught in one of the abandoned houses in the area. “He was taken to the scene where he dropped the bag. When cops opened the bag, they found dagga in it.” Mbokane said the man told cops he bought the dagga in Steynsdorp, near Elukwatini. “He told officers he was just a middleman between dagga sellers and foreigners. “The dagga weighed 5,389kg, with an estimated street value of about R20 000.” Mbokane told the People’s Paper that the suspect was kept in jail, and would appear in court again next Thursday.
