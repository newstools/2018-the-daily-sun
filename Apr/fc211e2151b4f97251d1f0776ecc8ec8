AKA has finally responded to the “cheap vodka” shade that Cassper Nyovest threw in his direction last week. Cassper has been on the receiving end of an intense amount of flack ever since he shaded AKA. “No cheap Vodka in my system!!! PLEASE!!! Premium vodka only!!!! #CirocBoyz,” said Cassper. He made this comment in the same week that AKA launched his premium, limited edition Watermelon-flavoured bottle of Cruz Vodka. This left many fans calling Cassper childish and unnecessary especially since he once endorsed a "cheap" phone that no one supported, and his bestie Riky Rick endorses Russian Bear which is one of the low-cost vodkas on the market. This also comes after both AKA and Cassper promised to be done with “stupid beef”. AKA has now responded in a way that is very out of character for him. “Stay in your lane, keep your eye on the prize and don't let anyone distract you from your mission,” he started. “When you are doing well, you attract energies, negative and positive ... that comes with the territory. Don't forget to drink lots of water and mind your business,” he continued.
