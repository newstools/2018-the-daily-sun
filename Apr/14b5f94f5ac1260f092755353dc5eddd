DESPITE having no hands, Mpho Mathabi is an inspiration to everyone who meets him. The 24-year-old from Dididi, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, started the Vhumatshelo Hashu organisation, which helps young people in his community, with or without a disability. The organisation was started last March and has since touched the lives of many young people in the Vhembe district. Mathabi, who studied marketing at the Vhembe FET College, said he started the organisation to deal with the frustration of local young people who had little access to opportunities. “I don’t have hands, but my brain is not disabled and I lead a normal life like any other person. I can look after myself, do my school work, use a computer and even write using my feet,” he said. “I started this organisation not for the disabled but for all youth. We are doing our bit in empowering young people. “Since we started, we have visited many schools to motivate pupils. Our most recent project was career guidance where we invited local colleges to come and interact with the youth.” He said wherever they went, people were inspired to see him motivating others while living with a disability. Mpho said he wanted to show young people that everything is possible with dedication and hard work. “My message to the youth is that they stay focused and think positively.” He appealed for any form of assistance for the organisation.
