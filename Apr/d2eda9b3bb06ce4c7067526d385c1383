WHEN Police Minister Bheki Cele visited Engcobo residents in the Eastern Cape on Saturday, they had one request . . . Government must tear down Mancoba Seven Angels Ministries Church! A petition to have the church building demolished, signed by more than 1000 residents, was submitted. They’re holding the church responsible for the deaths of five cops and a soldier after men stormed the eNgcobo cop shop in February. Residents said the church was a place for thugs and of evil. Prince Dabulingwe Ndzima of the Amaqwathi said: “We hope the minister’s visit will bring about change.  With the help of police, traditional leaders and churches, we’ll see to it that no cult churches mushroom here.” Resident Hucks Ndindwa said: “We don’t want that church. Our hearts are bleeding because of what they did.” Cele met the Seven Angels brothers’ mum at her homestead. Nombongo Mancoba said she missed her six kids, three of whom are dead while the others are in jail. She said church services are not being held. Cele said Amabherete would be sent to respond to attacks, and demolition of the homestead was in process. The accused, including Seven Angels brother Phuthumile Mancoba, will be back in court on 7 May on charges of murdering five Engcobo cops.  Other accused will be in court next Monday.
