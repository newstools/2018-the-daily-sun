Another group member, Andile Manqindi (20), said he hoped the song would change people’s attitudes towards fat women.“We want to stop this bad attitude, and encourage fat women not let negative remarks ruin their lives,” said Andile.“We also plan to produce a short film to support them.” Lwando Gxilitshe (27), who is an up-and-coming filmmaker, said: “Body shaming is wrong and we want to take a strong stand against it. “The film will show real-life stories of how some people tried to commit suicide after being teased about their weight.”Pumlani Mkiva (24) said she is often mocked about her weight. “It’s encouraging that this idea is coming from men, because they are usually the ones who tease us about our weight.”
