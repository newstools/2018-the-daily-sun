Madigoe, Chairperson of Santaco women’s desk. Told Daily Sun, “We are here to
bid women to our mother Winnie, because we drew ours strength from women 1956.
Women like Winnie.”She
described Winnie as someone who would say if something is wrong or write and
was not two faced.She said
even though the taxi industry is male dominated, Winnie taught them that if
they want something, they must go and get it.She said they
had come there to offer their messages of condolences and support to the family
of Winnie.“It must
not end here, someone must take the baton from here and take it forward.”She also
used the opportunity to outline the problems they face as women in the taxi
industry.“We also
have our issues in the industry, the governance in the industry needs to
consider us.“Most of
the women here are widows, we feel like we are not considered, we are the step
child of the government.”
