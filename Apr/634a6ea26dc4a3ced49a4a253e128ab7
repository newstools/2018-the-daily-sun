THEMBA Moloi left in the morning for work last week but a few hours later, his family learned that he had been murdered. The 26-year-old was kidnapped by two men who assaulted him before throwing him in a river in Alra Park in Nigel, Ekurhuleni. His father, Khabo (60), said he watched in horror as Themba’s body was retrieved from the river. “We heard from witnesses that Themba was accused of stealing a phone but we don’t believe it because he wasn’t a thief. “If he was a thief we would be complaining about him stealing from us. That I can bet on. “He used to ask if we needed anything and he was working.” Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said the suspects ran away after throwing Themba into the river. “Someone saw them and rushed to the police station to report the incident. The witness told us one of the suspects is a well-known tavern owner from Alra Park,” said Ramphora. “The body was found after a rescue team and police chopper went searching for it. “The chopper managed to spot it and it was retrieved from the water.” Ramphora said a case of murder was opened and two suspects were traced to their houses and arrested. They were charged with murder and will appear in the Nigel Magistrates Court.
