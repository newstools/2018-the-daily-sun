HE is a Metro cop and has two weapons. The one he uses to fight crime, the other he rents out to zama zamas in exchange for gold. On Thursday, cops received a tip-off about someone dealing in gold. When they went to the address and conducted a search they were shocked to discover a 43-year-old member of the Ekurhuleni Metro cops who was dealing. He was arrested immediately. During the search, they found five pieces of gold, a cutting torch, gold refinery equipment, 12 rounds of shotgun ammunition and cash that the cop couldn’t account for. He took police to a shack at Everest squatter camp in Springs, Ekurhuleni which belonged to a 25-year-old zama zama. “Our search revealed a Norinco 9mm pistol with eight rounds of ammunition hidden underneath a carpet. The suspect was arrested for possession of an unlicenced firearm and unlicenced ammunition,” said police spokesman Captain Thivhulawi Tshilate. “It was later found that the firearm was licenced and belonged to the arrested Ekurhuleni Metro Police officer,” he said. The Metro cop was charged with negligent handling of a firearm. Some residents claimed there were many Metro cops who worked with zama zamas. Cluster commander Major-General Mumsy Mbele urged cops to continue to create a safe and secure environment for residents. The suspects will appear before the Springs Magistrates Court soon.
