A church member said: “I think it’s not part of our culture to give strangers clothes belonging to late family members.” Sibongile Mbokazi, a secretary at the church, said they appreciated the donation and didn’t fear wearing the clothes. Dudu said she chose to have her birthday at the church as her mum, who died in 2014, had been a member.“I felt that giving my mum’s clothes to church members would make her happy.”Sazi Mhlongo, president of Traditional Healers’ Association of KZN, said nothing would happen to people wearing the clothes, as long as the family had done the right thing.
