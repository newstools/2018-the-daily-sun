A MUM and her kids are living in fear. The family from Moloto Village, near KwaMhlanga has become the target of a gang of thugs. The woman’s husband, who is in prison for breaking his parole conditions, allegedly reported the gang to the cops and the cops retrieved dagga worth R40 000. But the men went to the woman’s house, demanding that she pay the R40 000 back. The woman (49) said she and her kids were traumatised when four gunmen wearing balaclavas stormed into her house on several occasions, demanding the money. The family has since fled their home. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the woman should speak to the station commander in the village, who would take it from there.
