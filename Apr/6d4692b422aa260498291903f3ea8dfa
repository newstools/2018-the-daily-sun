GOVERNMENT has approved two interventions to
restore order and stability in communities of the North West province. A task team
of ministers, has been dispatched to visit the North West to establish the
facts on the ground. The task team
comprises the Ministers of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; Health;
Finance; Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, as well as the
Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster of Ministers. According to
National Commissioner of Police, General Khehla John Sitole more than a 100
people were arrested in Mahikeng, Mmabatho, Delareyville and Lomanyaneng on
charges of malicious damage to property, public violence, possession of
suspected stolen goods and business robbery. "I am
urging the communities of these affected areas, especially community leaders,
to come together and work towards peace and stability through robust discussions
and negotiations instead of violence. "Since
the outbreak of violence, I have instructed additional deployments of various
disciplines of the SAPS to stabilise and normalise the affected areas,"
the National Commissioner said. Communications
Minister Nomvula Mokonyane said they are expected to submit a report in the
next two weeks. The report
back will assist in determining any further interventions that may still be
required. She said the
main objective of this intervention will be to restore trust and confidence
between labour and government. Assist the
province to upgrade its systems and capabilities, ensure compliance with the
legislative and regulatory framework of government. These
interventions by government follow continued tensions and violent protests in
the province amid calls from some community members for Premier Supra
Mahumapelo to step down. Criminal
elements have infiltrated the protests, with vehicles being set alight, shops
and buildings looted, private and government buildings broken into and
vandalized.
