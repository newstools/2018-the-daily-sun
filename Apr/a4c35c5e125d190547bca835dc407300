been in and out of hospital since the start of the year. She give in peacefully in the early hours of Monday
afternoon surrounded by her family and loved ones. Madikizela-Mandela was one of the greatest icons of
the struggle against Apartheid. She fought valiantly against the Apartheid state
and sacrificed her life for the freedom of the country. Her activism and resistance to Apartheid landed her
in jail on numerous occasions, eventually causing her banishment to the small
town of Brandfort in the then Orange Free State.
