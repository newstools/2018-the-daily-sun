PAVEMENT hawkers from Marabastad occupied the offices of the department of small business development in Tshwane on Wednesday. Their leader, Ramodike Morema, said department officials accompanying former president Jacob Zuma, when he visited two years ago, trained 100 people but didn’t issue certificates. They were also apparently promised start-up material worth R9000. “We submitted quotations, waited, and decided to pay for the material ourselves, hoping to be refunded,” said Morema. He said they bought expensive equipment and, as a result, are now heavily in debt. “They played us. We’re occupying these offices to take a stand.” The hawkers dispersed after an official addressed them. Department spokeswoman Brigette Petersen did not respond to WhatsApp messages and, despite promising to get back to the SunTeam, her phone rang unanswered.
