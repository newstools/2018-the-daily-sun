REPRESENTATIVES of candidates vying for the Mpumalanga ANC chairmanship said on Tuesday they want a leader who will save the party. Ronny Malomane, representing Peter Nyoni’s faction, said Mabuza made it clear he wanted Mandla Ndlovu, acting chairman, to take over from him. “The ANC does not belong to Mandla or David,” he said. “We’ve been talking about this even before the conference.” He said the PEC should have convened to replace members who moved into the NEC immediately after the national conference. Meanwhile, Meshack Malinga, representing Charles Makola, said: “We want to elect people whom we believe will serve the interests of the people. “We don’t want Mabuza’s shoes to be filled because his legacy will continue.” Sello Shai, representing David Dube’s faction, called for the disbandment of current committees. Ndlovu said he was not handpicked by Mabuza. He said he’d wait like everyone else to be nominated. Asked about the state of structures in the province, he said the the ANC’s work continued, despite internal squabbling.
