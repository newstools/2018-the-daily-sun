ECONOMIC Freedom Fighters Leader Julius Malema has addressed the people of Brandfort in the Free State at the EFF Winnie Mandela Memorial Service.Addressing the masses, Malema highlighted that that they make no apologies for coming to Brandfort, because they want to give the people of Brandfort a voice."We gather today with our hearts filled with sorrow, a gigantic tree under whose shade we found comfort has fallen. It was a tree that grew under so much pain and sorrow," Malema said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv0hTC6YIbCIaeBd5lis0Y8iAH3A62ttI7CgcCwU-FNnTPS-cyFW4KuV_33JDa0emJz0oci37e8raadO3kSgi2ZJekHz90nfRy1lR-vIdyffm6UuqOMUXVJ61RuZmsGgWw9kFCz6alrhWPLuQ1WNMq8wISYStsBr_2N_MEaI9ji-oJZnCtqsbvipG1G4zXZG96SEkpiLBMUcZz2DY_XzdAUh2CS3qTOKVYZzC1vZeEAhb6cR-mMoJffWRzmEbPTieX0g2biKqXDd9WKzom4fjv9r0cKBMqP\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP89PDVX37EGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Yet, they protect the statue of Paul Kruger. They protect each symbol that reminds us of our struggle and oppression."Malema further attacked the ANC by highlighting that Mam' Winnie was able to provide a clinic for the people of Brandfort, even though she was under oppression. "Yet the ANC government even without anything to fear have failed to provide the people of Brandfort with better healthcare," Malema said.He said Mam' Winnie wanted the land just like the EFF."We don't hate white people, they have naturalised. They are like the tree and the grass here. We are saying to the white people share the land""We are saying we want the majority of people on this land must own the land. And that the minority be allocated land by us, the owners of the land. No the other way around," Malema said.
