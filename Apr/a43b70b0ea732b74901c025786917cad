POVERTY is cruel and few suffer more than poor, abandoned and orphaned children. On Wednesday these often forgotten kids were reminded that some people care. The kids of Child Welfare SA in Phuthaditjhaba kasi, QwaQwa, received a visit from the Bachana ba Tekela Project, which arrived with a load of school shoes. Project director Moleleki Tekela told Daily Sun: “Winter has arrived and it’s painful to see these kids go to school in old shoes and sandals.” He said some pupils dropped out of school not because they didn’t enjoy it but due to poverty. “Some of these kids, with support, will one day be able to change their families’ needy situations once they grow up.” He said the project had been approached by a social worker. He said they’ve helped three children’s homes in the province so far. “We’re not ending here. I wish everyone who can would donate. These children didn’t choose to be born poor.” Fungani Mbengo, the home’s welfare manager, said: “Our children were so happy to see there are people who love and care for them.” He praised the project’s members and urged other business people to donate as well. One of the kids Thabang Motaung (14) thanked the project and said he had been forced to wear his gogo’s takkies to school. “I felt bad when I went to school and looked different from other pupils,” said Thabang.
