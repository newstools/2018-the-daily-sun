Upon inspection, he saw a human hand and a foot.” She said the farmer then called the police, who immediately went to the scene.“Members of the search and rescue unit went to the scene to investigate. “When they got to the farm, they found the body of a woman in her thirties,” said the spokeswoman.She said although the body had a few injuries, the one that stuck out was a huge wound on her head. Mbhele said police suspected the woman was hit with the hammer before being buried.She said the dead woman was wearing a pink top and a pair of black leggings. “We are urging residents to come to Mid- Illovo Police Station to inform cops of any relatives that have gone missing. “That would help us identify the woman and find her family.” Police are investigating a case of murder.
