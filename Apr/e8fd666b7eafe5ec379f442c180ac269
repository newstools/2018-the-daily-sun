SPORT remains one of the most powerful tools to bring together different nations, countries, ethnic groups – uniting people from different backgrounds without any need for labels. Gauteng Premier David Makhura has therefore taken this very route to unite people and stop xenophobia and racism, with the launch of the second annual Social Cohesion Games to be played at several venues around the province.The tournament was launched at Killarney Cine Centre in Joburg yesterday. In attendance were Zambia legend Kalusha Bwalya, now a Caf executive member, as well as South African legends such as Doctor Khumalo. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuNHUNIx0ryi2qjclidqksowNFcE7H2RJlpVWKaC5qAouTa12aJuMJnkGJftcC5MCEnLYpIYwycNQbt1RDQ_KmGz-mTaeUSr0ugzVP_hhUQnvjJBix-jKwkNcwCcCJHGTUg-57cq58tabW3vmLq0II0Dj8_gsKQv2x7iHGobgpZ7ZjFKRxZPfjCUFq4k7iHMIm4wHNT2f-Tg-mXVFZns39TnrSuT0PdvG8mGT5IJzSg40ygVv-FP6kcbMDb-klHs2d8N_XDSHlgQ0VkMKn40g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMCNlJw2gUdqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

There are incidents of racism happening everywhere, which shows we still carry that past with us.“And this year we also want to say no to abuse of women as well as xenophobia. “Gauteng attracts people from all over the world. Many of them, especially those from Southern Africa, come here as soccer players.He added: “With xenophobia, people are fighting, blaming each other and that has been a huge concern. When you have migrants from Europe they are seen as job creators and when you have African migrants, they are seen as a problem. “We have to change that mentality, this is our continent – everybody who is here needs to make a positive contribution.”Zambia’s eighth most capped player Bwalya said he planned to attend the games this year after missing the first edition last year. He said: “What the premier said is important. It is heart-warming for me to be here and feel welcome. “This year I want to be part of this initiative. To have this special day to bring people together, as Nelson Mandela said, is fantastic.”Legends who will take part include Jabu Mahlangu, Steve Lekoelea, Innocent Chikoya, Edelbert Dinah, Tebogo Moloi and Frank Makua.
