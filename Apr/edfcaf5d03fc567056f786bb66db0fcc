Parliament’s committee on public enterprises will reach out to the
Hawks to help track down the Gupta brothers so that they can be issued a
summons to appear before the Eskom inquiry.Chair of the inquiry Zukiswa Rantho told Fin24 by phone on Tuesday
that the brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh were to appear before the committee
along with former SAA board chair Dudu Myeni and Gupta business associate
Duduzane Zuma on Wednesday.Last month the committee took the decision to summons them after
they failed to appear before the inquiry after invitations were extended to
them.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvRlpczz4j1dlXxm6Cm7umLxYqy8Ak8U9Qt0j_8_FVpTLql5vI3MfLUo6ZEG3zpcU7ePE4EE0YmQ2BKWJ9wpluaKmJpgfDLSISFip0EIvBN8dpcEqSGP8K_0xDJ9quz7HkVgh1G8cX7WKZjg4gc-6RqUn9_09nfXBIhDD7qdALB73ZpJ0dTXnUTr1lkiEUedJLxC18SVDdujLYJOR0zMvOU9m2rV5yz2m5DUX95M54azX1b_l0W4kv1ZWNW_AlQPb6gBhOyUxZ3rWLe_oD3Pf_Y3TZyieM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNNIuks_cpMfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

of arrest to those who fail to respond to the subpoena. The Sheriff attempted
to deliver the summons to the Guptas and Zuma on April 4.The Gupta’s lawyer, a director at BDK Attorneys, Rudi Krause told
Fin24 on Monday that he did not receive a summons from Parliament on behalf of
his clients.Rantho confirmed on Tuesday that the summons could not be
delivered to the Guptas as they are not in the country. “We will look at inviting agencies to help locate them to give the
summons.” The committee will decide what to do after the summons is issued. If
the Gupta brothers still refuse to appear then Parliament will issue a warrant
of arrest, Rantho explained.Similarly, the summons could not be delivered to Zuma, as he was
not at the address registered with the electoral commission, Rantho explained.The summons were however delivered to Myeni’s last known place of
residence. According to a statement issued by the committee, the summons was
“affixed” to her outer main gate. “This was done after the security guard at
the residence refused to take receipt of the summons,” the statement read.Rantho said that Myeni cannot appear because she is ill. The
committee still has not received a doctor’s certificate.The committee will not hold the meeting scheduled for Wednesday as
the witnesses will not be appearing, Rantho said.The committee has to wrap up its work in the inquiry and planned
to table a report before Parliament by mid-June. But Rantho told Fin24 that the
tabling might happen later as Parliament will be in recess in June.The committee will compile the report with the evidence they have.
Those who wish to make submissions to the inquiry have until Friday April 13 to
do so.SOURCE: NEWS24
