The days of losing your unused data at the end of the month will soon be over. Users will now be allowed to carry over their unused data to the next month. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) made this announcement on Thursday, in Joburg. Icasa said that all Networks are required to provide this option to ensure that consumers do not lose unused data as is the current practice. Icasa further said that service providers must notify users when their data falls below 50%, 80% and 100%. "This will enable consumers to monitor their usage and control spend on communication services," said Icasa. The new regulations also expects all network providers to allow consumers to transfer data to other users on the same network. Service providers will no longer be allowed to charge consumers out-of-bundle rates when data has run out without the consumers' specific prior consent. "After the regulations are published, service providers will be given a month to comply", said Icasa CEO Wellington Ngwepe. The regulations are expected to be gazetted in the next few days. Icasa said that, while the regulations do not seek to directly or indirectly regulate costs, they improve regulations around data, SMS and voice services. https://www.fin24.com/Companies/ICT/sa-cellphone-users-will-now-be-allowed-to-carry-over-unused-data-icasa-20180426
