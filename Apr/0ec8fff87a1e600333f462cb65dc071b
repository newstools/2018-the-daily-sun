A former senior Limpopo police officer's hopes to escape jail have been dashed after the High Court reversed her not guilty verdict for theft. Caroline Mokatse, a former tactical response team commander in the province, was dragged to the Limpopo High Court after the Mokopane Magistrate's Court acquitted her on theft and corruption charges in February 2016. The National Prosecution Authority (NPA) had appealed the decision. On Tuesday, Judge George Phatudi ruled that Mokatse was not guilty of corruption, but found her guilty of theft. Mokatse was arrested in 2010 after she and four of her team members were accused of stealing R525 000 in US dollars, which was part of R5m worth of foreign currency they had confiscated from businessman Faizel Mohamed on the N1 north, between Makhado and Polokwane. They had arrested Mohamed for contravention of currency exchange and income tax laws. One of Mokatse's co-accused pleaded guilty in 2016 in the Mokopane Magistrates' Court, while the case was dismissed against two of the other accused. A fourth accused turned State witness. Mokatse will now be sentenced for theft on a date still to be decided by the High Court.
