THEY were walking together as a family, but thugs brutally separated them for good. Silindile Zungu (21) from Mahlabathini Village near Verulam was stabbed to death and robbed of her cellphone. Silindile, her boyfriend and their two-year-old son were walking in a sugarcane field when the horrible incident happened. Her boyfriend’s phone was also taken, but thugs didn’t hurt him or the baby. Councillor Fakazi Mdletshe said cops must patrol the sugarcane field in future. He said the field had been turned into a haven for evil robbers. He confirmed that there had been many robberies in the area, but that Silindile was the first victim to die as a result. “This year alone more than five people were robbed of their belongings but never opened cases,” said Mdletshe. “Instead they asked me to intervene.” He said he was in the process of forming a committee that would patrol the area. Reaction Unit of South Africa spokesman Prem Balram told the SunTeam they were asked by a passerby to come to the scene. “Our paramedics rushed to the scene and found the man trying to stop the woman from bleeding. She had been stabbed in the back,” said Balram. “But there was nothing paramedics could do as she was already dead.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a murder case was opened. She appealed to anyone with information about the suspects to contact their local police station or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
