They spoke to cops who were responsible for school safety and drug prevention. Van Dyk said: “The station has a close relationship with principals.“We’ve also established a school monitoring team with the education department.”He said they identified and visited up to three schools every month. “We do spot searches, where we look for drugs and weapons,” he told Daily Sun. After the meeting Ollis said he was happy with the measures the station had in place. “We’re going to go back to parliament to report to our portfolios,” he said.
