EVERY day, desperate people collect rotten food and items that can be sold for recycling from a dump to survive. When eThekwini Metro Police tried to prevent shack residents on Kennedy Road from entering the dump at Springfield, all hell broke loose. The cops used rubber bullets to disperse them but residents said they would just return after the police had left. Sandile Dlamini said: “We have been using this site for over 10 years now but the police are harassing us. This rubbish puts food on our tables as there aren’t any jobs.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsusPllt6YVHVYWeWyV4ZZ6yjMxX9s3HjCy1zExw-fm0ggeH3KwC8SMuxnnd382mJQRbqBSWniYw9Xg0JugvX6qsGZl7_Ev4nu2WhEXj8VzHJyNZtZ3lur9_-MTpP7XVg1Numcl1Q_v6_7PjzEoLxiR-tCCSm5CFGnutSubEjNGS6Vg2Znq1SpZOAXSeSPAlsT1wmbt35_bHsH7S6MltAyRATJfELxGAobLsb0X1HUAJ4T-lnmpIDBHZ6aT8sF0iaGnPhRXecT-edv3GdNgMJiPBWrFIivAl\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMO4nwIb-2MzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

These things are dumped, so why are the cops fighting us when we want to get them?” she asked. Metro police spokesman Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said: “Residents are not allowed to go there because it’s municipal property. You need permission to enter. They cannot collect food there because it’s rotten. We are warning them that they will be prosecuted if they enter the site.”
