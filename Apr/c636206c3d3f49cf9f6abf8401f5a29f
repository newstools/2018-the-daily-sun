We feel so blessed.”, captioned the rapper who is set to be a father for the fourth time.The couple have both previously dismissed the pregnancy rumours and fans would have been forgiven for thinking the pregnancy would never be confirmed.#SNL Surprise! #InvasionOfPrivacy out now! ?????? @iamcardib #cardib #iamcardibA post shared by  SAVAGE.
