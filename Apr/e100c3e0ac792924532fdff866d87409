A MAN charged with raping his 10-year-old daughter appeared in the Mhala Regional Court on Wednesday. The 32-year-old from Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, was arrested on Tuesday 3 April. He was arrested after the girl’s mother opened a rape case against him. The accused was expected to make a formal bail application on Wednesday. In an unexpected move, he dumped his Legal Aid lawyer in favour of Decorn Sibuyi, a private lawyer. The court heard that the accused allegedly started raping the girl before the Easter Weekend. The incidents reportedly occurred when the mother was not home. The mother reported the matter to the police after noticing bruises on the girl’s vagina. She took the little girl to the doctor and a doctor confirmed that her daughter had been raped and that it had probably happened many times. Prosecutor Musa Makhubele asked the court to make sure the suspect was kept in custody. Sibuyi asked the court to postpone the matter to allow him to get confirmation of the suspect’s address. Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba postponed the matter to Monday.
