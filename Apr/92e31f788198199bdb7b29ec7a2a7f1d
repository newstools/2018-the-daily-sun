THESE cops use music to unite kasi residents. On Tuesday, the Police Music and Cultural Association outreach programme hosted an event at Reneilwe creche in Galeshewe, Kimberley, in the Northern Cape. The programme aims to improve the relationship between communities and the cops. The event was attended by provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Risimati Shivuri, who is also a member of the police band. Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock said: “The commissioner handed over a JoJo tank, a microwave, cleaning material, blankets and party packs to the creche. “The tank was installed on Wednesday with the help of Lieutenant-Colonel Willie Mapaya. The programme was opened with a prayer and a scripture reading by Chaplain Goitseone Maseng. “The handover was a token of appreciation from the cops to the community. “We wanted to show residents that we care about the children and will continue to protect and see them as priority in our crime prevention activities.” Kock said the Northern Cape would host the Police Music and Cultural Association National Unity Festival in September. “The festival is held annually during Heritage Month to celebrate diversity in the service and is hosted rotationally between all nine provinces.”
