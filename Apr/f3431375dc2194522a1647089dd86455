NOT everyone gets the chance to die and come back to life. Gogo Margaret Baloyi says this is an experience she is very glad to have had. The 69-year-old from Diepkloof in Soweto told Daily Sun she died on Monday night but was sent back by an angel. She said her children had gathered around her body and were crying. When paramedics arrived they certified her dead, but then she suddenly started coughing and her body moved! Her children stepped back in shock as they watched her coming back to life. Her daughter Kiki (48) said: “We called her name and she responded, but she seemed lost and had no idea where she was.” Kiki said she believed God had answered their prayers. “I couldn’t accept my mum was dead. I prayed like I had never before. I held her hand and begged God to return her to life,” said Kiki. She said after her mum woke up, she looked happy and she was smiling. “She told me she saw a tall man surrounded by bright light and he told her it wasn’t her time,” said Kiki. Gogo Margaret said she still couldn’t believe she was given a second chance. “I saw a tall man, who said he was Jesus. He said it wasn’t time for me to go,” said gogo Margaret. Kiki said her mum had been acting strangely the whole day before she “died”. “She told my sister-in-law to look after the elderly and to make sure her organisation doesn’t collapse. She didn’t understand what my mum meant, but now we believe she felt she was going to die,” she said. Joburg emergency services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said he would investigate which ambulance went to Margaret’s house.
