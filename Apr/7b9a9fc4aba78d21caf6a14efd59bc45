STRUGGLING Platinum Stars do not deserve to be at the bottom of the Absa Premiership.This is the opinion of Baroka FC interim coach MacDonald Makhubedu ahead of their league clash with Stars at Royal Bafokeng Stadium tonight (7.30pm).“Stars are a good side with good, experienced players like Robert Ng’ambi, Vuyo Mere and Ayanda Ncaba,” he said. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvkKGDAPub7he5ah9AtQiqcGj-t5DCgSeLBMVMbZX5OB3XXpV_sIs3UuZq6Kx-vrWUDbJhfwyFSW9qZAz1sZoHEbVY1Hwf5pcYQgYiMgDYE4fTnNmKddd41F7VIdOwPOKk7jb-rdSXMg4Wcl5q6iGMWlDBEWwzPiSAY6As_N_mJ9pkD3s93fJ4Q3zzzZ0HCOMjD5bIh5xVIuw6B_f1yZvEVZXY9-ZA_cqHN-DxAZMM4RQetEM4h61h863S_rRl2IJNvFP3OH4RPNAoX15zw3MhA_Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIUhKZeiva6REAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They shouldn’t be where they are in the standings.” Stars, who were recently bought by their head coach Roger de Sa for a reported R22,5 million, are rockbottom and have a huge mountain to climb if they are to avoid being relegated to the National First Division next season.Dikwena are on 17 points and have six games remaining to end their dismal season. They are seven points behind second bottom Ajax Cape Town. Dikwena have only been able to win three games out of the 24 played so far this season. But Makhubedu warned his players not to underestimate the Rustenburg side. “We have been telling our players not to read too much into Stars’ position – they might surprise us,” he said. “They are fighting for their lives in the top flight and will be tough to beat tonight. “We need to take them very seriously. They have a good coach in Roger de Sa as well as players who have won the PSL title in the past and will recognise the importance of this clash.” But the 36-year-old said they hoped to continue with the good form they displayed against Kaizer Chiefs in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday, despite losing 1-0.“We played good football and I think we were unlucky not to get the result,” he said. “I was pleased with the performance of the team. If we can play like that tonight I am positive we will get the result.” Baroka have targeted victory to cement their spot in the top eight, as that would be a huge boost for Makhubedu’s hopes of getting the job on a permanent basis next season.Bakgaga are currently seventh with 32 points from 26 games.
