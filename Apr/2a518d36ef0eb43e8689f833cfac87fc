Her passing is not in vain and it would not weaken the morale of our police force but will instead encourage them to do even more to continue to protect and serve our communities," Nkosi-Malobane said.In the last seven months, 12 metro cops have died in the line of duty in Gauteng. Five of the killings occurred in February, according to Nkosi-Malobane."This must stop, before we know we will be left with no one to protect the good citizens of this country."https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/jmpd-officer-shot-dead-outside-her-home-20180405
