We will report the matter to the mayor.“How do you tow a car while the owner is not present? Why don’t you at least give him a parking violation ticket,” they shouted.Fearing for their safety, the outnumbered traffic cops called backup. Polokwane municipal spokesman Tshidiso Mothapo said anyone who interferes with cops’ duties may be liable for arrest and prosecution. “The officers are empowered and protected by the law. Anyone interfering with their duties will face the full might of the law.“Motorists who disregard the law by parking their cars wherever they wish will have their cars impounded.“ They will also find themselves with hefty fines,” he said.
