They were released on R500 bail each.Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the case was postponed to next Tuesday.The ANC meeting was called by the regional leadership to discuss preparations for the conference. One of those prevented from entering, Msawenkosi Mchunu, said they wanted to meet the leaders and didn’t know why bodyguards had stopped them.ANC national executive committee member, Senzo Mchunu, condemned the incident. He told Daily Sun that the party was disturbed by reports that shots were fired at the meeting. Mchunu said the committee would wait to see the law take its course.“Guns are not allowed at our party meetings. “The ANC has never hired armed bodyguards for its meetings. “If the organisers of the meeting suspected chaos, they should have informed police instead of using armed people to control access,” Mchunu said.Meanwhile, provincial interim co-ordinator Sihle Zikalala held a special meeting with representatives from all 11 regions of the party in Durban yesterday.Zikalala allegedly called the meeting to discuss, among other things, tension between party members who supported Ramaphosa and supporters of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma after the Howick incident.
