When you look at the model of Christianity, God’s intent was to have relationship with man. The bible says in Genesis 3: 8 “Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day...” . This scripture tells me that at some point man and God were so close that man walked in God’s presence, that man and God were so close they had a relationship. As you continue to read the book of Genesis, chapter three, we see that because the man and his wife ate the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, after the Lord God commanded to man, “If you eat the fruit you shall surely die.”  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssM_Ei4Sc5E2m3cGSo40COLZYOl83mpDciGcjS_uYhoombavmpfVxKb0NVWVt-NEufpFGub7qy-U5fUsOfcNFELaEPrrKpj52H_TCD_2losYB0HNxWiTcYGKNA6sMy3dHZnv7EFMnP9grNhmPnKc8ZuPZbmgvkAuid9mYB33O0h3lsZL-HPnEwkTr6KsNzIk3-m0ngt9L34hUcI7r7qqX2XdbVmJJg3p9WC8x4mKOG3NMpJkkMb1uNUvFX5Eei7MbglBHpn5AbvP0ZChG8lbnx_4i-Krv7j\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGG9mAV_JGTjEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

So the man and his wife ate the fruit and died spiritually. Thus became the beginning of an amazing love story, that God awakened us spiritually and continues to do so today and days to come. So once we have become spiritually awakened, it is important for us to return back to the closeness that us (man) had with God. Talking according to the Google dictionary is the communication by spoken words; it is to speak in order to give information or express ideas or feelings. Usually talking involves another party listening. We speak on a daily basis to the people around us. We speak to convey communication. Many would agree that communication is very important in a relationship. So, Christian, if you have a relationship with God do you speak to Him? #qp_main1931149 .qp_btna:hover input {background:#00355F!important} #qp_all1931149 {max-width:815px; margin:0 auto;}Dear Christian: Do you talk to God?YesNoCreated with Survey CreatorHow do you talk to God? We speak to God through prayer. When I read the book Understanding the Purpose and Power of Prayer by Dr Myles Munroe, he says in his book that, “Prayer is an expression of mankind’s unity and relationship of love with God. It is also an expression of mankind’s affirmation of and participation in God’s purposes.” In the book of Luke chapter eleven, one of Jesus’ disciples asks Him to teach him and the other disciples to pray. Jesus then teaches the disciples how to pray from Luke 11:2-4. Jesus’ words were, “When you pray, say:...” , the verb say means to utter words. That is what it means to talk to God. As I speak to many Christians, I have found that many do not have a consistent prayer life. I should know because I too am one who struggled in the area of prayer. I have always been a Christian, I grew up in a Christian home, I was taught to believe and to have faith, but the concept of talking to God was something I only learnt in my early 20s. I ask you this question, because it is important. It’s important to have communication in any relationship, including your relationship with God. Developing communication in any relationship requires work and time. Good communication is something anybody can learn. I have learnt that communication is easier when done with someone you value. We put time and effort into the things we value. I learnt in my own walk with my relationship with God that my prayer life grew once I started valuing the relationship I had with God. I’d put in the time and effort to talk to God. If you’re someone who talks to God, that’s great, keep it up. And if you’re someone who doesn’t talk to God, try and find the source as to why. Like I mentioned, my why was that I simply did not value talking to God. Ask yourself why and once you have figured out why, ask God to help you and teach you how to pray, how to talk to Him, and the rest shall follow. And if you’re someone like me who can admit that you could be doing better in your prayer life like praying everyday or praying for other people, pray this prayer with me. Or if you don’t pray to God and would like to start, pray this prayer with me. Pray with me Father, You are the everlasting father, the One that was and is and is still to come. I confess that my prayer life has not been up to your standard, I ask you to please teach me how to pray and help me to grow in my prayer life daily. I thank you for the amazing and abundantly prayer life I will have with you from now on until forever, In Jesus’ name, Amen.
