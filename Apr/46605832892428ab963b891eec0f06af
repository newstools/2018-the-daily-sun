AFTER a promising start in the inaugural Diski Shield, Bloemfontein Celtic coach Jeffrey Legetla says they are targeting the main prize to set the tone for next season’s MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC).They gave a convincing performance when they thrashed Ajax Cape Town 3-1 at Dr Molemela Stadium at the weekend. This was their first match since they were pipped to the post for the MDC title by Golden Arrows in February.Celtic have now lost the Diski Challenge title twice in the dying stages of the season. They were also runners-up last season.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvCXSZQzC1F_uNRGksbwJ7V_aKwCTXo5_SI0zp1fEi6ZBg01LfG8XmgWMVXkfB5Cz-3E8HZgtGtfem1AB28uBJGv-TM3n4-h2FfnQHhsIAS-KFwBzjZ4ryXwXuYgFRiOoQB1l35SvTH-BkUJ7RXu_ROqe_U1t8QPdgliRCxyvUDK0vBYQp-cLsolLb0hGFbf8RVfnGoTv-aEFfAleul_eNfXWW5xQlVXbAIinGpRuyraySJ_5QfQB1KZg97i5c5SWpd3HyRjWp3N_0lz-gqFFjIAQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCnwtLnj_qHxEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We finished second twice in a row and we need this one to motivate the boys and boost their confidence.” He was impressed by Kgotso Mofokeng, their hero on the day who netted three goals: “The boy is brilliant. If he keeps his feet on the ground he will go far.”The highly anticipated Shield features 16 Absa Premiership reserve sides sorted into four regional pools – the Central, Coastal West, Coastal East and Northern pool. The event kicked off on Saturday and will run until 5 May.In the first round of the tournament, clubs play each other once and the club with the most points in each of the pools will progress to the semifinals. Reigning MDC champions Golden Arrows, who are expected to continue with their dominance after winning the MDC earlier this year, did not have a great start in the new competition as they were held to a goalless draw by Chippa United.
