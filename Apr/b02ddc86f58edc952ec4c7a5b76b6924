A MUM is shocked after she was allegedly told her funeral cover won’t bury her daughter. Thulisiwe Mbatha (37) from Ntuzuma, north of Durban said her daughter, Snenhlanhla Masondo (16), killed herself on Wednesday. “As much as I was devastated by the news, I took comfort knowing that I didn’t have to worry about funeral costs.” Thulisiwe claimed when she called Unlimited in Pinetown to claim for the burial, she was told they didn’t cover suicide. “Now I don’t know how I’m going to bury my child. I relied on the policy because I don’t have spare money lying around,” she said. Unlimited executive member Wayne Mann said: “While our policy wording excludes cover in the event of suicide, you are quite right that Thulisiwe was not informed. “At the time of sale, she wasn’t told that death as a result of suicide is excluded. “When it comes to our customer care agents, they are trained to inform clients of the circumstances in which claims are likely to be rejected for the purposes of managing customers’ expectations.” Mann said following their investigation, they will honour Thulisiwe’s claim. “We will contact Thulisiwe to ask for the necessary documentation. “We sincerely appreciate the fact that you brought this matter to our attention. “In this regard, we always look for a reason to pay a claim and are grateful that you’ve reached out to us,” Mann told the People’s Paper.
