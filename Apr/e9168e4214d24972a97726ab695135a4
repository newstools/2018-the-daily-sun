It’s heartbreaking that we have to pay people while the city should simply cut the grass and clean the graves,” said Nosipho.A grave cleaner said he had been making good money for the past two weeks because people asked him to clean the graves. “I sit at the cemetery entrance with my tools and charge between R300 and R500 per grave,” he said.Jenny Moodley, a spokeswoman for City Parks, said: “The city is aware of the long grass at cemeteries. “Our contractors will soon clean the graves.” She said the recent rain had made it difficult for contractors to keep up, but they would soon be on site.
