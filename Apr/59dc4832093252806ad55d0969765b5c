RESIDENTS of a block of flats in Langa, Cape Town can’t escape the smell of rubbish.Many of them told Daily Sun they couldn’t open their windows because of the smell outside their flats.“The stench is strong. Whenever I open my window, it smells as if sewage has just been thrown into my house,” said Asanda Nongcula (25).if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv7TChcbiQ9DRp6ZYXU305cEcyhn1XWUUgAQ5UDATTItsXNi-DKFKPoTkLW42MBviQo9S-eB4RIN3oFxLsh0Hq5IEhHwbOMrWOJVU1yqOKIioyHLXrkvgb8E3NqQqWFMUQmeNhXZbz138bCzcQ0mTc2uw7PL9Mq-YOXKz8TX75y7UPcrGjoBHYIJHqEe4PqI9LP-4snFiM33LqFlOyucHrna6PDT5MtdJrUIK8EQxnKs_KE60yDfmaqae8qbZYi3dtLm50ZHHbPtqLmBJy8aLqEeBFHzVM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGbF0d6Cu5fKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Sometimes it makes me feel as if I have a headache.”Nonkosi Plaatjie (39) thinks her 18-month-old child’s rash was caused by the rubbish.“My son plays near the rubbish because that’s where his father parks his car. I once saw him playing near a puddle of dirty water. He developed a rash after the incident.”The residents said they reported the matter to the City of Cape Town but nothing has been done. Asanda claimed municipal workers wanted a bribe to fix the problem.“We don’t have money. Does that mean we must drown in kak?”she asked.Assets and facilities management MMC Stuart Diamond said the City was aware of the problem and was trying to solve it.“The City’s tenancy management department is aware of an accumulation of rubbish at the Old Flats Hostel in Langa,” said Diamond. “The department has arranged for a crane to clear the rubbish at block B on Wednesday.“Inspections will be carried out at blocks A, C, D, E, F, G and H to see if there is any other rubbish that needs to be removed at the same time.”
