The result saw Chippa dropping further into the relegation danger, 13th with 30 points.In other matches on the night Polokwane City defeated 10 man SuperSport United 1-0, thanks to Rodney Ramagalela’s solitary goal.Platinum Stars played to a goalless draw against Baroka FC, Kaizer Chiefs got a late 1-0 victory over Free State Stars to move third in the table while Golden Arrows defeated Cape Town City 1-0.
