“I CANNOT get my ID because Home Affairs wants me to bring my dead gogo.” These were the words of Lindiwe Plaatjie from Siviwe kasi in Komga, near East London. The 36-year-old told Daily Sun she went to Home Affairs in February to apply for an ID but was told she had to return with her gogo, who had died two years before. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvbGZB3T_fTh9j2AuSdJb_UYBxhZVR1M-2Jf_1J_Cbi9QfIQqZSjYun5CRl_m46W22KmHU3Gem2BA77vE0NpycaByPN_TlVvlD6hzoeEXS0LFScZ3VIPT9QBKEjMp1kata23Ej4bigeVA5Y8VQ1U3zEi4OVBHHLoaUpPlfqWUBTDKI9n9uXVS2ipYKxKjMJ0pI4yK9LjD0-Y9vdUxc-KnF5itJxTz8Urw9lLjf-ZzGVH1rkRUofai3QcJcu1cJnwIhRfpi-j-wnGqZdqolQjp5BZ3BP4XuQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzK90LThbYPkXEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Lindiwe said her life was going down the drain because no one wanted to help her out. “Only my dead gogo knows where I was born. There is nothing I can do about my situation because I do not exist,” she said. “I can’t vote, get a job or apply for an RDP or social grants for my three kids. Instead of helping, Home Affairs is destroying my life. “I tried to come to terms with the fact that we will live like this forever. It is difficult living with the knowledge that my right to have an ID is being violated.” Home Affairs district operations manager Ngenisile Stuurman said: “At this stage we are unable to respond to this matter until we are fully updated about this particular incident.”
