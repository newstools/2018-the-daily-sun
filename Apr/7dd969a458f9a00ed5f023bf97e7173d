order to discredit her and all she had fought for in the struggle against the
apartheid regime.In one of the interviews, in the documentary
Madikizela-Mandela said: "It is
true, I am angrier than him (Nelson Mandela) I struggle to believe their
sincerity. We will watch that negotiations table, if anything goes wrong there.
I will be the first to go back to the bush and take up arms and fight for the
South African people."This was after Nelson Mandela was released from prison and the negotiations for free and fair elections began.Madikizela-Mandela  explains in the documentary that that the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission was nothing but a re-trial for her, to discredit
her, and make it seem that she was not fit to be Mandela's wife.However, the daughter of anti-apartheid activists Nelson Mandela and
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Zindzi who is the younger sister of Zenani Mandela
and the third of his three daughters said:"They were too formidable as a couple. Anyone who had
an agenda had to get rid of this formidable foundation first and then go
forward."She was explaining the relationship and the power that the
two struggle stalwarts had as a couple that the apartheid regime had to make a
plan to separate them in order for some of their plans to come to fruition.MZANSI took to different social media sites to express their
disgust at how the ANC as a party and Nelson Mandela treated the Mother of The
Nation.Winnie’s role in the struggle was erased, until now, only now are we beginning to truly celebrate and acknowledge her role in the liberating of South Africa. May we ensure that our children know her and say her name #WinnieMadikizela #Winnie— Bahaisane Movement (@Bahaisane) April 11, 2018" I was horrified when I realised I had lost my identity... Suddenly, I was Mandela's wife." #WinnieShe kept his memory alive while he languished in prison, what did he do to acknowledge her for it?— Jesus' Fave???? (@lulushezi) April 11, 2018#Winnie In as much as I appreciate and I am thoroughly getting informed by watching this doccie,I wonder where our local film makers are to tell our stories,to document our history, instead of relying others to narrate our own stories— Mohlatlego Ramaotsoa (@rmohlatlego) April 11, 2018What the ANC did to #Winnie is CRUEL! And she remained loyal to them until the end. I’m horrified— Kgomotso Moeketsi (@KGMoeketsi) April 11, 2018Why is Mama Winni being vindicated now that she’s passed on. This is rude actually. I’m officially upset. #winnie#WinnieMadikizela— #CATCHINGFEELINGS (@PearlThusi) April 11, 2018The #Winnie doccie is pulling all kinds of memories & experiences about her courage & suffering. She personified our suffering. The outpouring of emotion about Mme Winnie is poignant & justifiable. She remains a hero & likely catalyst for a better tomorrow!— Tim Modise (@TimModise) April 11, 2018We glorified Nelson Mandela when we should have done to mama #Winnie she kept his name alive while in jail and made us love him. He was weaker than her yet she's was the strongest link that the ANC and media weakened with lies pic.twitter.com/veixQ0hMKS— #SonOfWinnieMadikizelaMandela (@siphukuthula_L) April 11, 2018
