order to discredit her and all she had fought for in the struggle against the
apartheid regime.In one of the interviews, in the documentary
Madikizela-Mandela said: "It is
true, I am angrier than him (Nelson Mandela) I struggle to believe their
sincerity. We will watch that negotiations table, if anything goes wrong there.
I will be the first to go back to the bush and take up arms and fight for the
South African people."This was after Nelson Mandela was released from prison and the negotiations for free and fair elections began.Madikizela-MandelaÂ  explains in the documentary that that the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission was nothing but a re-trial for her, to discredit
her, and make it seem that she was not fit to be Mandela's wife.However, the daughter of anti-apartheid activists Nelson Mandela and
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Zindzi who is the younger sister of Zenani Mandela
and the third of his three daughters said:"They were too formidable as a couple. Anyone who had
an agenda had to get rid of this formidable foundation first and then go
forward."She was explaining the relationship and the power that the
two struggle stalwarts had as a couple that the apartheid regime had to make a
plan to separate them in order for some of their plans to come to fruition.MZANSI took to different social media sites to express their
disgust at how the ANC as a party and Nelson Mandela treated the Mother of The
Nation.
