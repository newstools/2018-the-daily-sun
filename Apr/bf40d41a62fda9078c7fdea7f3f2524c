RESIDENTS of Joe Slovo in Boksburg marched to the Ekurhuleni municipal offices yesterday. They wanted temporary electricity connections because the municipality can’t connect them legally. They threatened to continue with their illegal connections claiming the municipality had no right to demand that they disconnect them. Speaking for the protesters, Vuyani Makhatha said the municipality has temporary connections in places like Daveyton but fails to do the same for them. He said they also wanted to know when the process of building them RDP houses would start. “Mayor Mzwandile Masina came to us in 2016 and sold us dreams. “He said we would have houses and electricity soon. It’s been two years and there still is no sign of development in our area. “Our kids are in danger because there is no pavement along the busy St Anthony Road.” Vuyani said they needed urgent intervention from the municipality. They also wanted mayoral committee member Lesiba Mpya to tell them when he will deal with stormwater drainage in their area. “The municipality gave us chemical toilets and they can’t maintain them and there’s always a stench.” The protesters were met by mayoral committee member Masele Madihlaba, on behalf of Mpya. Madihlaba said he understood their grievances. “I will ensure the residents get their response as soon as possible.” Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said: “We will keep speaking to Joe Slovo residents. “We’ve shared plans to re-block the area to ensure basic services are received.”
