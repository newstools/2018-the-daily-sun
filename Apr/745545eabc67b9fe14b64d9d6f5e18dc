THE community of Braamfischerville, Soweto, erupted in anger yesterday over delays in getting their title deeds. They also complained about the lack of development in the area. Cops fired teargas and rubber bullets to break up the protest. In the chaos that followed, a two-month-old baby was rushed to hospital after inhaling teargas. Two men were also taken to hospital after being hit on their heads by rubber bullets. The residents gathered from early in the morning and burned tyres and wood. They barricaded roads with bricks and demanded to be heard. On top of their demands, angry protesters, mostly from Braamfischerville extension 8, said they wanted the ward councillor to give up his position. The community demanded title deeds for their homes, saying they had waited 18 years. One resident, Papi Mohlala (42), said: “Were were told by our councillor that we won’t get the title deeds. “Another challenge here is that there hasn’t been development around the area for many years. Why have we been forgotten?” The community also demanded a clinic and a police station in the area. They said they wanted a response from the City of Joburg in seven days. Councillor Leah Knott, City of Joburg’s MMC for economic development, was escorted to the area by Metro cops. She received the memorandum, signed it and promised the community to return soon with feedback.
