LOSING his parents and being jobless hasn’t dampened Amukelani Maluleke’s spirits.Instead of sitting at home and feeling sorry for himself, the 23-year-old entertains people at a taxi rank to put bread on the table.Amukelani was born and raised on the dusty streets of Mkhuhlu near Hazyview, Mpumalanga.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsug72psGN5ZxK3nrbMajW6xijMKzFTEcdRfKfg_1kkAZNmfZag4izWAKo7feU978xa8Uvau2NoRTbFUvozq5bRfgi1DjjfXnN_0D-vLEP3QLSkCluJVv3MmJCPmiT82cqQjd_bEouWscTYOMBhpLV6b0Ilkn518zJY_UsczFYNbsmHIsq0ftESld5b_-jQM33Uz5JoEKEUnKllUkBv7YSJte90V_QJneuZfYK_aDfRsO0BQ5En89SyjNRopUv9ogXyhjQlMHKMMmH10r2THCRPNWaO6aQc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLYyOdjs7c_4EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

With the money he makes at the taxi rank next to Thulamahashe Mall, he supports his family, including his 19-year-old sister who is in matric. Amukelani can make about 30 different sounds and imitates people, animals and cars.Speaking to Daily Sun, he said he realised his talent early on.He said he heard the sounds of birds and lions from the Kruger National Park which is near his village. “I love nature. So I started imitating animals and as time went on I could mimic almost anything.” He said he sometimes gets invited to perform at people’s events in his community, where he makes between R100 and R200 for each performance. His fan Matimba Mokoena (19) said Amukelani entertains them while they wait for taxis to fill up.
