Bloemfontein Celtic will give Mamelodi Sundowns a guard of honour in their last Absa Premiership game of the season. Siwelele will face the newly crowned league champions in their last match of the season at the Dr Molemela Stadium, Bloemfontein on 12 May. Celtic mentor Veselin Jelusic was among the first coaches to congratulate the Brazilians for capturing a record eighth Premiership title after they defeated Ajax Cape Town at the Lucas Moripe Stadium. The Serbian born said the Brazilians will be given the respect they deserve when they come to the City of Roses to lift their league trophy. Siwelele, who were booted out by Maritzburg United in the Nedbank Cup quarter-finals, drew 2-2 with Baroka FC in a league game played at the Peter Mokaba Stadium at the weekend. Veselin said: “I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Sundowns for being champions of the PSL. “They deserve it as they have been the best team in the league this season. On behalf of my players and the technical team we want to say congratulations to them. We will give them a guard of honour when they come to Bloemfontein. We have to because they are champions and out of respect for football we will do it.” Celtic are ninth with 36 points and they still have ambitions of finishing in the top eight. Veselin is glad that Sundowns wrapped up the league title with one game to spare. He hopes their coach Pitso Mosimane will field a fringe team and rest star players in their last game. Veselin added: “We can still finish in the top eight. We had a couple of injuries that affected our season. But our players showed character to fight back and drew the game. “We will keep on fighting and we have to beat Sundowns to reach our target.”
