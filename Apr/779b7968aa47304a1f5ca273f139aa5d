President Cyril Ramaphosa paid a courtesy visit to Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle in London on Tuesday ahead of a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting that is set down for two days later this week. Themed "Towards a Common Future", the meeting is expected to discuss, among other topics, weak global trade and investment flows, 21st century security threats, increasing the resilience of small and vulnerable states facing climate change, as well as advancing the Commonwealth's shared values set out in its charter of democracy, good governance and inclusivity. Twitter users, however, were too distracted by the luxurious room that the two met in to focus on the purpose of the President's meeting with the queen. Some questioned Ramaphosa's visit while others wondered whether the two were discussing the land without expropriation bill.                         https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/thats-our-gold-south-africans-react-to-ramaphosas-queen-elizabeth-ii-visit-20180417
