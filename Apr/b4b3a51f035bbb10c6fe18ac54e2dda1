XHOSA King Zwelonke Sigcawu celebrated his 50th birthday in style on Saturday. The king had a big party at Nqadu Great Place in Willowvale, Eastern Cape, and gave out gifts to poor people from the area. He told Daily Sun: “When I was inaugurated, I mentioned that I am leading people who are very poor. “So I decided to ask Satma’s founder Dumisani Goba to organise this birthday celebration. “I approached him because I noticed he is very good when it comes to organising events. “He suggested I launch a foundation to help the people I am leading.” On 3 February the king launched the King Zwelonke Legacy Foundation. “We asked people to come forward to pledge money and we have managed to raise R1 million. “This money is going to be used for the things the people I lead need. “After this birthday celebration, we are going to sit down and discuss projects we can do. “I don’t want to benefit. I just want the people I lead to benefit. I want these people to have good lives.” The king handed over 125 wheelchairs, school uniforms and sanitary towels to residents of Willowvale, Centane, Dutywa and Xhorha. He said the wheelchairs were donated by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. Speaking on behalf of the people who received gifts from the king, Twelve Apostolic Church in Christ leader Sisa Nongqunga said God gave them the king to look after them. “What makes you grow is your respect for your people. “The king has shown his respect with the gifts he gave us. “He didn’t bring brandy for the people to come and drink,” he said.
