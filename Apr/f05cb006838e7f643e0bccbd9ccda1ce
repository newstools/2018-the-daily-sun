It started after she left her kids asleep when she went to the Sassa offices to fix their grant problems. She has two kids but residents only managed to save one of them. “When I returned from Sassa I saw a huge cloud of smoke, but didn’t realise it was coming from my shack,” said Viwe. She said they were still waiting for DNA test results before they could bury the child.Viwe currently lives with her cousin because her shack was destroyed by the fire. Mboro said: “I will cover the funeral and burial costs. The funeral will be held in the Eastern Cape.”
