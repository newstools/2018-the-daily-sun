The SPCA has expressed shock over the skinning of a dog in
Bloemfontein.The dog, which was hit by a car on Friday night, was still
alive on the road when it was skinned, said the SPCA."According to eyewitnesses, a car bumped a dog and
drove away. The dog was still alive and lay along the road. The owner of the
dog came looking for her dog and then came to a very gruesome scene.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>"[The suspect] was busy [skinning] her dog alive. She
asked him what he was doing, and [the man's] answer was that he was hungry and
wanted fresh meat," said the organisation.Residents then took the man to the Mangaung police station,
where he was arrested and charged with animal cruelty. By the time the SPCA arrived,
the dog was dead."We were very shocked at what we saw. The dog's body
lay aside and then one leg was also laying skinned aside the road. We asked
[the suspect] what he was trying to do, and he acknowledged that the dog was
still alive when he started his slaughter," said Bloemfontein SPCA senior
inspector Reinet Meyer.According to the SPCA, the man had food in his backpack,
including "bread, polony and chicken nuggets".Police confirmed that he had been charged with animal
cruelty, and would appear in court on Monday.National crime statistics do not specifically highlight
cases of animal cruelty, but Meyer praised the police for their support of the
SPCA's fight in Bloemfontein."They are really supportive, because we put our
photographs in the docket and they were shocked by the photographs."'Where there is animal cruelty, there is also domestic
violence'Meyer said that, while there were a range of animal cruelty
cases, the SPCA endeavoured to educate people about their pets, rather than
prosecute."If it [is] really serious, we prosecute. In the past
month, there are three cases where we are going to prosecute people for animal
cruelty in Bloemfontein alone," she told News24.She also linked animal cruelty with domestic violence,
saying that inspectors sometimes reported suspected cases of domestic violence
to the police."Yes, especially with children. If there is animal
cruelty, you will also see that children are also being abused. It is a fact that
where there is animal cruelty, there is also domestic violence."According to Regan Jules-Macquet, project manager for Nicro,
there is a strong link between animal cruelty and abuse of humans."Animal abuse appears in offences such as domestic
violence, where pets of the victim can be injured or killed. There is a
significant association between domestic violence and animal abuse, to the
extent that animal abuse is regarded as an indicator of potential domestic
violence in the home. (KL Thompson and E Gullone Promotion of Empathy and
Prosocial Behaviour in Children through Human Education (2003) 38(3) Australian
Psychologist at 175, as well as Campbell op cit)," Jules-Macquet argues."In studies of women at a domestic violence shelter,
71% of women who owned pets reported that the pet had been a target of violence
by the abuser."https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/spca-shocked-after-dog-is-skinned-alive-in-bloemfontein-20180416
