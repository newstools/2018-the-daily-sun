“YOU are ugly and weird! You are a homosexual and nobody likes you! Go kill yourself!”These are phrases a child may be using that leave other kids feeling small. Anyone can be a bully. Your child could be a bully and you, as a parent, could be ignoring the signs.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Bullying is the repeated singling out of an individual or individuals for unkind behaviour. Both girls and boys can be bullies, and this takes form in verbal assaults, physical attacks and cyber bullying.Your role as a parent:
  Get counselling for the bully.
  Instead of fighting, work with teachers and other guardians to discourage this behaviour.
  Set a good example by not bullying and intimidating others.
  Encourage positive activities and behaviours.
  Monitor their social networks.
  Make clear family rules on bullying and clarify what behaviour is unacceptable.
  Ask them to put themselves in other people’s shoes.
It is not easy to admit that your own child really is a bully, but ignorance does make it worse. #Standupagainstbullying, #plzcallme 083 323 1023, mizzb@lovelife.org.za, Facebook: loveLifeNGO
