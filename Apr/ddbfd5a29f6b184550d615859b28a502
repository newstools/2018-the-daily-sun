A FIGHT sparked by a lobola refund has left five men dead and one without his private parts.  The fight was between in-laws from two villages in Mbizana, Eastern Cape. According to sources, the feud started when a woman’s in-laws demanded their lobola back after they accused her of leaving her marital home of seven years. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvP_M7O1I2wdGREGdaBAMPPepJ5evA4zfZihd5Aws07GvpJnF5A8huyHJTWmSPG4vUyf_-ApWwNmLmbLftTzHSiSEikCGIM_aG0wJ0S02p5-OYmqL8rbc2npxqyrp164Tf3PAumXvAS0nGxeuS98hRP1KsBcIofVQihrkhiwzO0FqU0x2PllpGx-Y8z6mv8SGZoRiBvyrX_G4htZdjalIHb4ibA7QCY7dKOse6qcvY36s7UnP0ecC8vKvZHEJeLRcpazHBCBeJ9p6g3yfdx9JQF2XxTKwrS\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNzZl490NQJDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

One of them had a knife wound on his head. Bits of his brain were everywhere.“The men’s bodies were found scattered all over the village on Wednesday morning after cops were called.”He said police were looking for the attackers, who were believed to be hiding in the forest. “Five cases of murder have been opened and arrests wll take place soon,” he said.Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana, chairman of the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders, said this would not have happened if traditional courts were recognised by the justice system.“When a woman leaves their marital home, families meet and discuss the return of lobola. They look at many aspects, such as how many years she spent there and the number of children she conceived. “They then decide how many cows should be given back to the husband’s family.” Nonkonyana said the organisation was shocked by what had happened. “We don’t see why lobola should lead to fighting because it’s a family thing. “This gives us the impression that our traditional structures are either weak or non-existent. We are going to investigate.” A mass funeral will be held at Mkhandleni Village on Saturday.
