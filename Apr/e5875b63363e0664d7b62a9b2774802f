ALTHOUGH SABC1 drama Tjovitjo did very well at the South African Film and Television Awards, some of the dancers are not happy. This is because they have apparently still not been paid for their work. In a Facebook post, dancer and actor Charles Mafafane complained that while the show bagged nine awards, not even one dancer owned a four-roomed house or a small car. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Writing in a mixture of languages, he said the actors had to go back to lives of poverty while the people who made the show sent their children to private schools. He claimed he had been waiting for his money for seven months. Vincent Moloi, the show’s executive producer, told Daily Sun they had explained to the actors they had financial problems. “We always say Tjovitjo is a self-funded project. We took money from our own pockets to build this project,” he said. “In the process, we ran out of funds as we were doing workshops with the actors. “We told the dancers before were started shooting that once we got the money, we will pay them. They agreed to this.” He told Daily Sun he understood Charles’ complaint but said the dancers had only shot a dance sequence for the last episode. “We’ve signed a contract with the actors and had an understanding.” SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said the public broadcaster didn’t engage with actors but dealt with production houses. Kganyago said: “We pay production houses on the basis of their contract with the SABC. “We’re not aware of any non-payments.”
