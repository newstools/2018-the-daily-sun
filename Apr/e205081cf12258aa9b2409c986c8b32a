THE residents of Melusi 2, Gomora squatter camp in Hercules, west of Tshwane are furious. This was after they heard that the municipality wants to move them to another area to make way for a road. They said unless the municipality pays them R6 000 each for the materials they have used to build their shacks, they are not going anywhere. The residents were moved to Melusi 2 from Atteridgeville and Zandfontein in 2012 by the municipality. They said during the move, they were promised that they would get RDPs in about 18 months but no one has ever received a house. Community leader Daniel Thobakgale (53) told Daily Sun that what the municipality is asking from them is difficult. “We are not going anywhere unless the municipality compensates us,” he said. Tshwane MMC for housing and human settlements, Councillor Mandla Nkomo said there was no way the municipality could compensate anyone for giving them serviced stands. He said the municipality was in the process of formalising the area. “We are working on a bulk infrastructure to improve the lives of people in the area.”
