Thandi told Daily Sun that the centres are very important to people living with disabilities. “It’s uplifting and good for our well being,” she said.“ I love it here because I’m able to take part in various educational activities. The centre is empowering.”She said her family has been her source of strength. “Their support throughout the years has kept me going.“I’ve been living with disability from an early age. “My leg wouldn’t function properly. “I have accepted my condition and that has given me the freedom to be myself and focus on positive things,” Thandi said.“Even though it wasn’t easy at first, I have since learned that your physical disability cannot define you as a person.“It’s what’s inside you that matters most.” Thandi encouraged people living with disabilities to take ownership of their lives.
