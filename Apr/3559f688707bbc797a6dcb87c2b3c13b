BOITATOLO Seitisho said he’d rather guard cars and wash them than commit crime. The 33-year-old dad from Batho, Mangaung told Daily Sun he and four other men work together to make sure that motorists’ cars are always safe and clean. The men work on Henry Street in the Bloemfontein CBD and according to Boitatolo, no car has ever been damaged or stolen. “I enjoy my work because it puts food on the table for my family. The money I make also helps me to send my five kids to school,” said Boitatolo. “The unemployment rate is high, but it doesn’t mean you have to sit and wait while you have hands to use. “I started working as a car guard in 2014. Motorists are happy with our service. “We also wash their cars while they are at work. I’d rather do this job than to commit crime.” Car owner Sam Jones (51) said he was happy with the service provided by Boitatolo and his friends. “I know that my car is always safe when they are around,” said Sam. “I also make sure that I pay them fairly because they have families to feed. We are all helping each other.”
