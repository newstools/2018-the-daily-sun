THE ANC in Gauteng has cracked the whip against members who behaved badly before last year’s national elective conference. The party said it had expelled one member and suspended five others after they were found guilty of misconduct by the provincial disciplinary committee. Committee chairman and Gauteng Transport MEC Ismail Vadi said the decision was made to send a stern warning against ill discipline and disorderly conduct in party structures. The members were from the Ekurhuleni and Tshwane regions, and the suspensions range between two and five years. “They have been found guilty of behaving in a disorderly manner and disrupting ANC meetings, sowing political disunity and causing divisions and undermining the structures of the party,” he said. Vadi said the disciplinary process against the members was started in November after the Gauteng provincial working committee meeting to discuss branch general meetings was disrupted. Five members of the ANC in the Ekurhuleni region were charged with breaking various rules of the party constitution and one was expelled. “In accordance with the ANC constitution, these members have the right to appeal against the ruling of the provincial disciplinary committee within 21 days,” said Vadi.
