He was then trialed and successfully prosecuted. He was convicted and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. This proves that there is justice in this country to anyone who has been a victim of crime regardless of who you are."She added that the sentence would "send a message to others who think that they can get away with crimes committed whilst in custody".NEWS24
