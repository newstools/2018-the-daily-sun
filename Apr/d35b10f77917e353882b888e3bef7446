Five suspects, aged between 30 and 52, amongst them a
former Police Captain who resigned from the SAPS in March this year, were arrested
during a sting operation themed "Operation Thuma Mina". The operation, led by the Deputy Provincial Commissioner
responsible for Crime Detection, Major General Bafana Linda was conducted last
night until the early hours of Wednesday morning. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo
said  the arrest of the five is the
consequence of a drawn-out investigation dating back to 2014 when the then 33
year old woman, Mercy Rantshana, was killed in what was widely believed to be a
ritual murder on 15 June 2014. Her mutilated body was discovered by a herdboy in the
bushes in Tshitavha village outside Thohoyandou. Motlafela  said the
police then launched intensive investigations that led to the arrest of the
48-year-old local Traditional Doctor, Nelson Baloyi also from Tshitavha. He was arrested on 01 July 2014 and was subsequently
sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder by the Thohoyandou High Court on
23 September 2016. He said this sentence did not stop the police from
continuing with investigations as it was believed other conspirators could
still be on the loose. The police then launched a well coordinated operation
"Thuma Mina" last night at several villages around Thohoyandou and
arrested the suspects. The Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke
Ledwaba has commended this team of dedicated investigators for their sterling
detective work. "These latest arrests have a potential of bringing
to an end barbaric acts of ritual murder in which innocent human beings are
butchered for their body parts", concluded General Ledwaba. The arrested suspects will appear in Thohoyandou
magistrate on Tomorrow . More arrests are expected.
