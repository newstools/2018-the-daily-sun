Pupils were sent home early and a psychologist and social worker would provide counselling. Shafer said: “Pupils who witnessed the incident are greatly and understandably traumatised, as are the teachers’ two children. “Teachers from the neighbouring Diazville Primary School were also severely traumatised by the incident. Counselling and support will be provided. “Police are reportedly on the scene, and officials will co-operate with the police as required. “I’m deeply disturbed by the unspeakably tragic incident.“My heartfelt condolences go out to the teacher’s family, friends and school.” Western Cape cops spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said cops received a complaint of a shooting incident at a primary school at 7.20am. “When they arrived at the scene, the body of a 42-year-old woman was found in the parking area,” he said. “And on Middelpos Drive near the school, the body of a man was found with a wound to the head.“Circumstances surrounding the shooting are under investigation. A case of murder and an inquest docket were opened.”
