Edward Zuma said his father, former president Jacob Zuma, who is due in the Durban High Court on Friday to face charges of corruption, is a victim of a witch-hunt.Edward is part of the "Defenders of Radical Economic Transformation", a group that has organised a march from the Durban University of Technology's (DUT) Steve Biko campus to Albert Park where a night vigil will be held on Thursday evening ahead of Zuma's court appearance.Albert Park is a walk away from the Durban High Court where Zuma will face 16 charges relating to 783 payments, which, it is claimed, he received in connection with the controversial multibillion-rand arms deal.Â if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsup-tRDTXYYpF7lPdA4Deaqz4yn0ErYEJSoa3Haks1IKfIgRfEs6z_ke5WJRW-jqHL4gWoUpxHNqe_2whs0XrUXRETKhijUGvI_1RTHNsHyc8_cbk6wlktEJm8CMRMkptXGTsRrAnyP_9DVPtT-XvS4p7f7S1ACIeR1jx7xgykVi5mAwKcAKv725C2SwQqSrnEG3cCyQMNxIRMUHiDNOseNlQgcSRtdeMNGK5kP-pNe5MzCS2w6ldTOP8GwSAU86nxi7g7UYubErqPG6Nku9N1QAUH7TLc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzB6BsmysiY-TEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
