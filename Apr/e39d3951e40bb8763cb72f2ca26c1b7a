Edward Zuma said his father, former president Jacob Zuma, who is due in the Durban High Court on Friday to face charges of corruption, is a victim of a witch-hunt.Edward is part of the "Defenders of Radical Economic Transformation", a group that has organised a march from the Durban University of Technology's (DUT) Steve Biko campus to Albert Park where a night vigil will be held on Thursday evening ahead of Zuma's court appearance.Albert Park is a walk away from the Durban High Court where Zuma will face 16 charges relating to 783 payments, which, it is claimed, he received in connection with the controversial multibillion-rand arms deal.Â if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstuKRA3FweR_WGA0Gq2Hb_jFtpXl5CDliEPXFntJfAYwAvGWwP5qpryzCKuUY5Lxu-K2PrOpm62LxrNJfwZWyI6nveAB2NDuTsuLl4Fbgll_KofqCspbyx-qq3UvJ-HGzfLZNiukMcjAtA0mjutwfWjQSd_mjcGVmevpYX5B9aRL1yiWRIIwwRVJKRFOEGeD-7rdc47lziquHR6FPNLWSPDiCHY0ZLl7MlWoY-NgfekzdFNGEL9pgAdC8C2iSqoEmUuPue6be6-bthLu-8R9lBujV5CmKoH\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzC6Ir7LRD7N-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
