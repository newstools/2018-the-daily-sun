Africa said."The UWC community is extremely saddened by his
death."Professor Duncan Brown, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts,
described Wessels as a "wonderful man - an exceptional researcher and
teacher, a truly fine colleague, a considerate and generous leader, and an
empathetic friend"."He was one of those whose passing makes the world seem
a poorer place - but who leaves us all better off for having had the chance to
know him."Michael is survived by his wife, Lindsay, and his
sons, Tao and Akira. Our thoughts and prayers are with them, and also with his
colleagues and friends, in this very painful time," Brown said.According to the university's website, Wessels is the author
of Bushman Letters, published in 2010.His research "explores new ways of reading San oral
literature and the politics of indigeneity", while he also wrote about the
representation of place and spirituality in South African literature.Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said an
inquest docket was being investigated to determine the cause of death.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/professor-found-dead-in-uwc-swimming-pool-20180413
