This time we didn’t make the mistake of conceding in the last minute of the game. Generally, everyone came to the party today.“There was a time when I thought maybe we would concede. But I could see the boys were still going strong and then we got the second goal. “Polokwane gave us a tough match, but we needed the win more than they did.”The 53-year-old, who is also one of the owners of Stars, is optimistic they will get a positive result in their next league encounter with troubled Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Saturday (8.15pm). Chiefs are still reeling from a shock 3-0 league defeat to Chippa United at the same venue this past weekend.“We needed this win but we cannot start celebrating – we have not achieved anything yet,” he said. “Chiefs are wounded and will be very dangerous. They will be aiming to return to their winning ways. But I am sure that if we continue playing like we did against Polokwane or even better, we can get something.” Rise and Shine head coach Bernard Molekwa admits they had a bad game. “I have to be honest, we just did not play our normal game,” he said. “I thought we would come back in the second half, but things remained unchanged. Platinum Stars put up a brave fight, they wanted it more than us. We must bounce back in our next game against Bidvest Wits on 22 April.”
