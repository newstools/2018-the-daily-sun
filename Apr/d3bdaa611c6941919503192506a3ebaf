A DURBAN Metro cop is in hot water after he apparently drove a cop van recklessly and skipped a red traffic light, causing a deadly crash.Two people were killed when the van skipped a red light in New Germany, west of Durban, last Tuesday and smashed into a Toyota Yaris.Municipal sources said an internal investigation was under way and investigators were awaiting its report to see if the cop should be fired.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv8lXBgjAZCEy63P7SBoWJLySKYnX2sgHDogLfXezVu4LJIvAEWJcgpI_0W8RW4tDE6qRH1dRpNvY5cV3jmDxLfo38ml0veZ1gT44L3C6YIQDmy-xDpO-8-tiq4X01w6NBZsj9n0lY8wx2Qs0q71OphzYyJ9cuxwWd6JHN4A1BQQ7X_PEp-CaVeNHO-RFA2GcLJN0zl32TzWgpjU8Dctrq0nBcfB8ukiM7KH_On7lfyUKpw74RC3oZqPoXrxel6Zmd8ljs0PAPKlD3-k1HdW-ETxZY2oto\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzD7Fjsq5Sj7XEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Management told him to stop driving Metro cars until the investigation is completed.” Police management have CCTV footage of the speeding van skipping a red light and hitting the Yaris, coming from the opposite direction. Durban Metro police spokesman Parboo Sewpersad said an internal investigation was taking place.“We are waiting for the full report, which will give us a clear image of what happened. It will also provide us with information on where the cop was rushing to and give us direction on disciplinary action to be taken.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said two cases of culpable homicide and one of reckless driving had been opened.“No one has been arrested.”
