Corruption continues to be a cancer that destroys the fabric of society. We must remember that every time someone demands a bribe, there’s a person who is willing to pay it. “So far, we have arrested 22 cops, 56 traffic officers and three officials who work in the justice, crime prevention and security cluster.” Makhurupetje said her department has trained 494 young volunteers in a programme called Young Civilians on Patrol.“The aim of the programme is to fight crime. These young people join the police during their patrols to identify and tackle crime hot spots. This year we have put aside R3,1 million to intensify the fight against crime.”
