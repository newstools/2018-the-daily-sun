Whenever we tell my granddaughter to stay away from him, she insists that the pastor loves her and has promised to take care of her financially.” The gogo said she opened a case of rape last year, but the pastor was never arrested. “Instead, every Sunday he still holds a church service in the area.”She said she has been taking care of her granddaughter since her parents died in 2009, with seven other grandkids.“My granddaughter started becoming a problem child after we joined the pastor’s church in 2015. I was shocked when I saw SMSes of sexual conversations with the pastor on her phone. “She confessed to being in a sexual relationship with the pastor. When we told her to stay away from him, she refused to listen.”The gogo said the pastor apologised when confronted and blamed the devil. “All I want is justice for my granddaughter because she was still underage when she had sex with the pastor.”Police spokesman Sergeant Khaphila Mvula told Daily Sun: “A case of rape was opened. We are in a process of getting the docket to see what happened in the case.”
