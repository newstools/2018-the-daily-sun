I counted more than 24 bullet holes in the car,” she said.“We are shocked. The kids were in the car because Sinethemba loved them.”She said Sinethemba usually came to see what the kids were doing. They were sitting in the Avanza near the house when a white car drove by and started shooting.Sinethemba’s uncle Lindelani Dyubhele said: “When I got a call telling me about the shooting I thought it was a joke. But I was so hurt when I found they were telling the truth.”Sinethemba’s family don’t know anyone who would want to kill him.“We can’t say why this has happened. We can’t find a motive. Innocent kids were killed in the shooting,” said Lindelani.Ward 34 Councillor Fikiswa Nkunzana said: “This is a tragedy. It is hard to believe that people can kill innocent kids who don’t know anything.”Even though there have been many minibus taxi and Avanza taxi related killings in the area, kids are not usually involved.“We all know these taxi people are killing each other but why were innocent kids also killed? No one deserves to lose their family members like this. The police must make sure they catch the suspects,” said a resident.Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said the circumstances surrounding the murder of four people are being investigated following the incident in Browns Farm.“Three suspects opened fire on the victims who were sitting in a Toyota Avanza. The suspects fled the scene,” said Traut.He said a fifth victim, also a teenager, was wounded and admitted to hospital.“The motive for the attack is yet to be determined and the suspects are yet to be arrested,” he said.Anyone with information regarding the incident is requested to contact CrimeStop on 0860 010111.
