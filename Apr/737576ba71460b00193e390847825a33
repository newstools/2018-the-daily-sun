GOLDEN Arrows midfielder Thabani Zuke believes the experience they gained in Spain last month will go a long way in helping them clinch the inaugural MultiChoice Diski Shield tournament. Arrows’ trip to Spain was part of their prize for winning the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC). They played two friendlies against Spanish clubs – Girona FC (losing 4-2) and Rayo Vallecano (winning 2-1). Now the KwaZulu-Natal outfit will be hoping to continue with their fine display in the Diski Shield semifinal where they will meet Mamelodi Sundowns at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday. Arrows brushed aside Sundowns 3-1 in the MDC, and Zuke is confident that they could do even better this time, as he believes they are a better team following their Spanish tour. However, the former SA Under-20 international acknowledged that the Young Brazilians, MDC champions in 2016, won’t be an easy nut to crack. He said: “This is a cup game, there’s no second chance. One mistake and you’re out, so we will need to be more clinical. It will not be an easy game for us, as Sundowns have been playing well. “But we are also a different team to the one we were the last time we played against them. Our experience in Spain gives us the edge over them. We aim to take the title, nothing less.” Also in action are the ambitious Bloemfontein Celtic, who will be up against the much improved Kaizer Chiefs. Chiefs thumped their Soweto rivals Orlando Pirates 6-3 on their way to the semis. Chiefs, who promised to up their game in this tournament after struggling to make an impact in the MDC in the last four seasons, have more than met expectations by making it into the final four. The Celtic match will also be played at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday. The final showdown is scheduled for Tembisa’s Makhulong Stadium on 5 May.
