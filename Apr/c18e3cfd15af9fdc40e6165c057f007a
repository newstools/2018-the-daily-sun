secret that there are individuals in the DA who have been trying to get rid of
me at any cost for the last few months,” she said.“They've
shown that they would flout their own processes and ignore their own values of
'Freedom, Fairness & Opportunity' to remove me.”De Lille slammed the party for
passing what she calls the “De Lille Clause”.“I have been fighting for a fair and transparent
process amidst the slew of allegations that have been thrown my way.“The DA
should be aware that, even if they refuse to follow due process in the spirit
of fairness, the laws of our country protect public representatives,” she said.“As someone
who fought for those rights during the struggle against apartheid, I will not
tire in ensuring that the hearing I have asked for is open to both the media
& public.“They
deserve to hear my defence in the interest of clearing my name in the most
transparent way.”De Lille is
currently battling to clear her name within the party after she was accused of
corruption and maladministration.Her hearing
has been postponed indefinitely.
