The invaders in Govan Mbeki took over the old sports ground and surrounding land at Gqebera Senior Secondary School. Community leader Sandile Dolo (43) told Daily Sun: “We started building our shacks on Good Friday. More than 500 of us are homeless. We arrived in the area in 1993, and some people have been renting since then.”In Colchester, street committee member Wanele Jibiliza said the municipality promised them land many years ago.UDM leader in the metro, Mongameli Bobani said: “The municipality is violating a decision taken in a council meeting. We will deal with them.”Mayoral spokesman Sibongile Dimbaza said invasions were politically motivated and they were engaging with affected communities. “No piece of land belonging to the municipality should be illegally occupied as this contravenes the City’s by-laws.”
