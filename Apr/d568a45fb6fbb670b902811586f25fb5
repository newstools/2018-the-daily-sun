The Premier Soccer League Disciplinary Committee (DC) has rescheduled Kaizer Chiefâ€™s appearance in front of the DC for the fan violence which took place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. Kaizer Chiefs were initially scheduled to appear on May 3 2018. The hearing has now been moved to May 9 2018 at 18:00. Kaizer Chiefs are facing charges of bringing the League into disrepute and misconduct. This follows events of April 21 2018 during the Nedbank Cup fixture against Free State Stars FC where supporters invaded the pitch, assaulted some supporters and security officials and damaged property at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban.
