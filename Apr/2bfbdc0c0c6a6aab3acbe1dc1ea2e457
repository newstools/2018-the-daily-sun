Anyone who watched  Mama Winnie Madikizela Mandela’ memorial service yesterday which was held at Orlando Stadium in Soweto may or may not have noticed the accent with which her great grand children spoke.One person who certainly did was controvercial poet and musician Ntsiki Mazwai who is known for speaking her mind.True to her nature, Ntsiki did not waste time in slamming the Mandela grandchildren and great grandchildren for having what she decribed as a “nasal twang” when they speak.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsultvPs7mpbiEpMuI2Z4JMTFNNW4l_-9fbelubxq3-c8Q5FSBAsgN92DYvrlqRzibk09BZHGGA-_1j9zLnTn3wTKdtkMyjpK5E6Zc1s9MJQxRGRfl9f54mGDCao1k1G-oxeiS0IKIZHGHsPNfrR11eWehx8EgUgSj0TdSB1JymSH1q1QeeaX0HflS0Bp8SKmndCtIJSh5QWJr9INhcmBsbK5ICsSAbve7n7ziBCiwlxoE5jeQ7_dTPTvTU7mm5jyHB1xAgrf7DGuBxZwpj9y3Lv1dOPWat8M88BJo4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzO2sn-EnkRR2EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Stop it.— #TheMasterPieceLIVES (@ntsikimazwai) April 12, 2018It's not cute when a black child only knows English.....it's not cute at all— #TheMasterPieceLIVES (@ntsikimazwai) April 12, 2018
