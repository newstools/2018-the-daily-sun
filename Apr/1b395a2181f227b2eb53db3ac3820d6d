MHLABUYALINGANA ward 17 Councillor Nhlakanipho Tembe’s property was torched on Sunday. Unknown suspects set the house and double-cab bakkie belonging to the ANC councillor alight in Engozini Village, northern KZN. The car alarm woke Tembe and his wife as the vehicle went up in flames. The fire spread to the house and destroyed a huge part of it, but luckily not the room they were in. Although the motive is not yet clear, people said there has been a serious outcry in their ward about Tembe’s inability to deliver to his people. A resident told Daily Sun ever since he became councillor in 2016, he hasn’t delivered anything and people are angry. “We cannot say who torched his property or what their motive was. But what is known in this village is people have complained about him many times to Mhlabuyalinga Municipality.” Another source said parts of the area had no electricity and Tembe has been very scarce in public. “He can’t even arrange meetings to address his people on important issues they complain about. We are still waiting for the municipality to respond to our grievances.” Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident and said a case of arson was being investigated by Manguzi cops. “No injuries were reported and investigations continue.” Mhlabuyalingana mayor Nkululeko Mthethwa said the incident had nothing to do with politics but admitted people unhappy with Tembe had lodged complaints with the municipality. “Nothing links the complaints to the torching at this stage. Let us wait for the investigation,” he said. Tembe couldn’t be reached as he didn’t take calls or respond to SMSes.
