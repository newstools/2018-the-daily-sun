GOGO Madile Mojau (85) died two weeks but she still hasn’t been laid to rest. That’s because The Holy Jerusalem Church and her family are fighting over her house in Dobsonville Gardens, Soweto. The church claims the gogo’s house belongs to them but her relatives say it was gogo’s house, which made them the rightful owners. Family member Mpolokeng Mojau (34) said they don’t want the gogo’s body to be returned to the house for the funeral service until the church releases the house to them. “Gogo told my uncle before she died that the church wanted to take her house. They took advantage of her because she was old. We’re going to take this matter to court,” she said. Her brother, Mpho, said the church had secretly changed the house into their name. “We wouldn’t have known about this if we hadn’t gone to the Deeds Office in Joburg. The copy of the deed shows the church is the new owner.” Mpolokeng said the house belonged to the gogo’s son and when he died in 2008, gogo was appointed as the executor but never had a title deed. She said: “The title deed was only made in November 2016 and immediately transferred to the church. We suspect corruption.” Molefi Mojau from the church said he knew about the issue but didn’t want to talk about it. Reuben Mashoeshoe of Mashoeshoe Attorneys said the family members are the nearest relatives and the matter has to go to court for it to decide. He said the church had to explain how they got the house.
