BAFANA Bodumo dance club uses gumboot dancing to stop unemployed youth from becoming criminals. Co-ordinator Mawethu Sajini (29) said they formed the dance group, based in Govan Mbeki in Port Elizabeth in 2001. “Our kasi is affected by the high rate of crime. “We find most youths sitting on street corners doing nothing. “We invited a few of them to come and that’s how we started. “Now there are 15 of them. “We always perform on street corners and practise in the studio so the youth are drawn into entertainment and get little time to commit crime. “We also train young people in dancing skills, so they can get jobs at lodges and hotels to entertain tourists.” Mawethu said they polished their skills in 2016 at the Vuka Arts Festival. “That was an eye-opener because we were exposed to the real world of arts and dancing. “We now have a contract with a lodge in Addo, where we get paid to perform for tourists.” Siphosethu Maboza (22), who joined the group in 2008, said they practise gumboot dancing and the toilet bucket dance. He told Daily Sun: “Gumboot dancing is popular in the mining towns around Joburg and North West. “We decided to do it here, because there are no mines in Eastern Cape. “People like it very much, including those who used to work at those mines. “We also practise the toilet bucket dance, which is popular because it reflects what is happening in squatter camps, where people are still using make-do toilets. Our dances tell real stories about local communities.” Siphosethu said people should develop their talents. “We want to spread the message that we cannot all be doctors or sports stars to succeed. We make a living by dancing and teaching the youth to reject crime.” Mawethu said: “We need a big place and financial assistance, as well as good dance trainers so we can compete with the best.”
