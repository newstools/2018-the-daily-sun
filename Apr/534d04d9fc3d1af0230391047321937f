LEVY Matjie regrets taking his wife to Life La Femme Clinic in Rustenburg, North West.

He said they paid the clinic about R79 000 to make sure his wife got the best service. On 1 March his wife Dorothy started contractions. However, Levy said his wife had to endure tremendous pain because there was no doctor to take care of her. When the doctor finally arrived, he told Levy his wife had lost the baby.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst2TTMgE2AYDXrZWX71u8AKzfuUeYstwN_lfgk_jDfuPK_dt_Auohx44BwXjm3LxzloR6K1Kc7FyvbYpifeuFyivBYuwDRHkmSUF8mRKWyuXMN5x8MKLkKyyaYqYz6FRwD0b_mtj73n5hkQrLvKbjr9yHUlHzOC5sUNOtOSiY5dErZr3vFLADxnBWbg0QSI2dtQU1NIxOk2OV70NXgtKE1GTbifRfPRmYiDbsP75rGh9bZrVfJ1QYWMsTFgWXsOOX2Eehns9Co9Jyl_T4ulqgSQNDT5HO0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNi6EA4tJROyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He also claimed the clinic threatened to transfer his wife to a public hospital. Dorothy is still at the clinic because she lost a lot of blood. According to Levy, his wife went to a gynaecologist before the incident and was told she and the baby were healthy. He also claimed the clinic wanted him to say that he arrived at 5am, but he refused. Life Healthcare spokeswoman Tanya Bennetts said shortly after the patient arrived at Life La Femme, her clinical condition changed unexpectedly and the care priorities changed from a simple delivery to saving her life. “The doctors and the staff responded promptly and appropriately to the situation and managed to save the mum’s life. “We have completed our internal investigation and are satisfied by the way our doctors and staff responded to this challenging emergency situation. “We will invite the family to share the confidential clinical findings.”She said due to the patient confidentiality policy, she couldn’t share any more information on the matter.
