GOSPEL singer Thendo Khedzi (35) loves attention!It was when he saw people going crazy about an Aston Martin, taking pictures and getting out of their cars to have a look, that he made a plan.The gospel singer from Tshwane CBD can’t afford a super luxury car like that, so he decided he would turn his Mazda MX6 into an attention getter.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssy54xJ4HWUbBkGGDyseJz8JRDwt6DMDWNJr6QwYeS3_mlQCq-vHNZltnh0D8TvesuuhDun9-1GYE_ySR6A5a0t8Ix7gN7VAT_nROU0U-e-e51VRv70Zj1cAoSU56lg7rZLLzexUXtcMbX5bTcdDj0loyKnGItOBPg5MjrBiazupzNB0FWoJE_AKGv9FmF74KzYCg7_cy8dlp5l0OGO9RfgLPWw8ILBHPQOtSRgW7hiiFbN064yMw2LPQByNyc9QjcfNDRycfhjjMr0jdZNUJ84jpRk0ZHR\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLlB_VU8bW1CEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Add vents, ribs, air holes, metal lines, anything you can think of,” he said.“And I got want I wanted.”Thendo said he took the car for a ride.“Girls screamed and men hooted. Boys got excited when looking at my car. For the first time people took pictures of my wheels and I was happy.” “I add anything I like. If I go to place and buy something as a souvenir, I buy two, one for me and one for the car.” He said he takes long trips and the attention he gets is amazing. His car has its own Facebook page and is called Khavhade Aristopi , which means, “Let them come, we’re not going to stop”. His wife and two kids find space between the teddy bears and vuvuzelas!
