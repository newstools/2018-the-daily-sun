THIS dad is a worried man. “My daughter does strange things,” the 41-year old man from Mandela Village near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun. “She speaks in strange languages, and when we pray for her she goes wild.” He’s pleading for help from anyone who can help his daughter, who’s in grade 9, to have a normal life. He said he was praying on Monday, and before he could finish his 14-year-old daughter began to scream, threw herself on the floor, and rolled like a snake. “We tried to hold her but she was too strong. Her face changed into that of a scary creature. “When I spoke to her, she laughed at me. I knew she wasn’t herself,” he said. He said during the day she behaved like a normal child but at night she turned into a something else. The girl told Daily Sun she flies to Nigeria on a needle, a knife, bread, bottle and a broom. “Three people come to me at night and give me instructions to kill my mum. ‘They say if I did that I would become a queen,” said the girl. “I once tried to go to church, but spirits told me I won’t get rid of them until I’m done with my work.” Pastor Herbert Mbonane said the girl needed prayers. Dr Emmanuel Ndlazi said the girl must see a psychiatrist.
