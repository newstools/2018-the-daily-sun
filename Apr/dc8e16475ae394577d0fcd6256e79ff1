MARY Vaughan (67) did not suspect anything when she got into the bath and used the new shampoo she had been given by the hospital. But within minutes it was as if her head was on fire: her scalp and face started burning! Mary, from Newclare in Joburg, has shingles, a virus that causes a painful rash to appear on the body. As she has been doing for years, she went to Helen Joseph Hospital to fetch her treatment, which includes ointments and shampoo. “I was surprised to get a new kind of shampoo,” said Mary. On 25 March she used the new shampoo. “All of a sudden I felt a deep burning sensation. It was as if my head was on fire,” she said. Her entire body started burning and she struggled to breathe. “Luckily my granddaughter was at home. She called my eldest daughter, Linda, who lives next door.” They had to rinse Mary’s hair about six times before the pain subsided. “We are lucky to still have mama around,” said Linda. “We want someone to take responsibility.” Hospital spokeswoman Mathapelo Nhlapo said the product was removed from the shelf after the first complaint and they were awaiting a report from the supplier. The product was recalled in Gauteng and KZN. The hospital received five official complaints about the shampoo.
