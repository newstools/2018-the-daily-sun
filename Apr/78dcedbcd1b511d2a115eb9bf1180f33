Flavalite and Standard Bank painted the wall of Isikhokelo Primary School’s library and have donated books. They’ve been going around kasis since early last month fixing libraries.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvt8gmX_Txh5iQCh15ZmrAY3v9QDMuYWtJZ5GX-TT_r8JwykLfcPelsFgu0Umos8F9ipD6b-S7oHXVci3odXN4b0uTYyms4yRCsKM7sxLUzbtLuItTpuFmfhq7DyuFHziIjkokPnZVY2dcWvqp5VqRBhQLOra5Mp-goKI54XLfGuBo1uwBfb3QjMEFkheSzk_67R0_qsFQEHVHlEXvJ6XSZU4sF-XbEydeeyzcw3WzYmjUBSTwnIhMIj-WscN0plY2o-n8skK64x_I3kX7ZP8ky8p9kUhk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFuEwINbpHKmEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The responsibility is now on the school to look after the facility,” said Gordon. “Pupils should make use of the resources and change their lives.”Pupil Sandisiwe Kakaza (12) said: “We’re happy to receive a revamped library. I hope all pupils will make use of it. “The colour is beautiful and I think this will encourage others to visit the library and read books.”
