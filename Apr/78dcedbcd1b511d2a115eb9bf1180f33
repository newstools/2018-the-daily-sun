“Empowering an African child with education is the best way to equip them for the future.”These were the words of Unathi Tunzelana, co-founder of Flavalite Innovations. Flavalite and Standard Bank painted the wall of Isikhokelo Primary School’s library and have donated books. They’ve been going around kasis since early last month fixing libraries.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv3YBphjP8Vt0keOyOzwkPcQxje-3TZ2O6j7PMtDSkFuL-P5LzGHZ-SYMKfL1zYp8JZRzafODS96vVmUXGPxg9MUl6Jt4g9ciAQ-aJQI3l3EDBvSM6mNTWBznCayxYvmn2mStBbCvcqdzK2LSZaAxI1iHEDrMIrJin7VlUiHyRy05inKhBuqXKd-sOpObAFcOR8KUqKksWIvEVgSGJF7vw5Gbk_VyDFp5D0457cipUoa0gPVA7PGz0_7PKXPxI__9-P1r9hiDI6mbcn-uPCKDlFxdVZ4U4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOk_74IFm5SGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The responsibility is now on the school to look after the facility,” said Gordon. “Pupils should make use of the resources and change their lives.”Pupil Sandisiwe Kakaza (12) said: “We’re happy to receive a revamped library. I hope all pupils will make use of it. “The colour is beautiful and I think this will encourage others to visit the library and read books.”
