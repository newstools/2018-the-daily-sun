FILLING up your car is usually one of the more expensive exercises you do every month. To calculate your car’s fuel consumption is quite simple. Here is how. 1 Fill up your tank with fuel. 2 If your car has a trip odometer, reset it to zero or write down the existing mileage as displayed on the odometer. 3 Drive your car until it is time to fill up again. 4 Try to ensure that the vehicle is nearly empty. 5 Fill it up and write how much fuel you used. 6 Your trip odometer will display the kilometres you have travelled since your last fill up. If you don’t have a trip odometer, record the latest odometer reading and subtract the first odometer reading to determine how far you have driven. 7 To calculate how many kilometres your car drives on one litre of fuel simply divide the total distance travelled by the total litres of fuel used. For example 500 km / 52 litres = 9,6 kms per litre. 8 To determine fuel economy, multiply the amount of fuel used by 100 and divide that by the total kilometres driven. Example: 45 litres x 100 / 500 = 9,0 litres / 100km.
