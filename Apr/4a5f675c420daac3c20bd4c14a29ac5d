There’s this beautiful wave of black women now embracing their natural hair. Society has finally allowed black women to set the beauty standard, and many are doing that through their hair. However most black women did not grow up with natural hair. We are the generation who spent many hours and a lot of money at the salons  straightening our hair with chemicals. It is only now that black women are learning how to take care of natural hair. What most people don’t realise is that taking care of straight hair and curly hair is completely different, and one of the things that has been difficult for many black women  to unlearn many of the things we were taught such as combing your hair. There are many reasons why you should not comb your natural hair often, and here’s why: 1.	Hair is naturally curly, whereas combing is for straight hair. A comb is designed to keep straight hair “tidy” and in it’s place. Curly hair strands are not “made” to be straight, That is why whenever you do straighten your hair it will eventually go back to it’s curly state. Combing your hair often will not allow your hair to thieve in it’s curly state. 2.	Combing often can cause breakage to your hair as you’re forcing the coils to be straight. When you comb your hair on curly, coily, kinky hair to “make it straight” you damage the hair from pulling and tugging your hair strands. 3.	Combing hair is very painful especially on dry hair. Whenever you do comb your hair make sure to comb it wet or when moisturized with conditioner or oil.
