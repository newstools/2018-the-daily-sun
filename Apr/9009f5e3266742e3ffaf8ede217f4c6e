The Department of International Relations and Cooperation
(Dirco) on Wednesday said it had received confirmation from the South African
Consulate General in Dubai that South African businessman Justin van Pletzen
was being detained."It is alleged that Mr Van Pletzen's arrest is linked
to a video he recently circulated about Mr Ajay Gupta, whom he met in Dubai.
However, this is yet to be confirmed by the local authorities,"
spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya said."Consular staff from the mission in Dubai did visit Mr
Van Pletzen [on Wednesday] and Dirco will maintain contact with Mr Van Pletzen
and his family to render consular services."if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssDo4CDnHWaJkGtxWo-Q1NhWrCWVRJ75ZKyc5xB03W7WRxgse061ewVfBX-DxSnDjqk93Q4JNLhjiCO5mfxhHXJkHi8Deuk0YAoyMFwafufl_J5U_q_KEQs-QdE38R0UIEn6EMKhTv-VBaUS8PYMtXQ7Ts4OJCW9u3UPKSn6p8uFZ5As22Q8puXM7b3vyulq9SlT6TQXpeYig5yR2NphCNUQ-nrbqBxTnLrogOVi6yNeuTrazEbxiQvGo2CrEDqLcJHsdHs71ZNdUBkiS5B3427rLrGgWFY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGwgqISIkyAlEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

nature of the charge or when Van Pletzen would appear in court.A friend of Van Pletzen confirmed the arrest to News24 on
Tuesday, while Dirco confirmed that the businessman's mother had made contact
claiming her son had been apprehended.In the recording, Van Pletzen is seen speaking to a relaxed
Ajay Gupta in Dubai, asking him if he would return to South Africa.Gupta appears friendly, and tells Van Pletzen that South
African authorities had not yet given him "a reply"."The day they give a reply, I'll go there," Gupta
added.After the publication of the footage, Hawks spokesperson
Hangwani Mulaudzi said it was up to the investigating officer to find ways to
bring Gupta - who is considered a fugitive from justice - back into the
country.The Hawks have not yet revealed what Gupta is wanted for and
only said that the charges were not related to the Estina Dairy Farm project in
Vrede in the Free State.SOURCE: NEWS24
