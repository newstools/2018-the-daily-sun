Menzi High School in Umlazi was named the best performing school of 2017.Principal Muntu Ntombela said she was shocked when she got a call to attend the awards last week, because she never thought a school with so few resources could become the top school in the country.“I want to dedicate the award to my staff, district officials and all those who support us.” The school scored a 100% matric pass last year, and 123 pupils out of 126 got university exemptions.The district was congratulated by KZN education chief director Thembelihle Gumede. “You have raised the KZN flag. May be the spirit of Thuma Mina prevail,” she said.An official told Daily Sun yesterday the awards meant a lot to them and proved they’re doing a good job despite difficult circumstances. This was after the SA Democratic Teachers Union claimed they were not doing their job properly.Union secretary Nomarashiya Caluza said the awards came about because of teachers’ efforts and said they should be congratulated.KZN education spokesman Sicelo Khuzwayo said the department was proud of Umlazi.
