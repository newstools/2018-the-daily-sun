THE Limpopo school received several applications for the advertised position of principal and the SGB shortlisted the suitable candidates. But then the whole process came to a halt amid claims of irregularities. And today, four years later, Tidima High School in Sekhokho Village, at Botlokwa outside Polokwane, still doesn’t have a principal. The SGB told Daily Sun the district office had hijacked the process, leaving their school in chaos. Chairman David Ramabi said after they had shortlisted suitable candidates the district office took over. “They said there were irregularities in the work we did. We were surprised because they couldn’t point out any irregularities. “We went to and fro fighting with the district and in the end, the education HOD ruled that the district office should let us run with the process but this didn’t help.” Ramabi said the school’s 2016 matriculants achieved a 34% pass rate. “Things are bad at the moment as the school has no management plan. Some teachers don’t attend lessons while some pupils write their tests without being taught or even seeing their teachers. The school is heading for a disaster.” Rambi urged Education MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe to intervene. Dingaan Baloyi, the deputy chairman of the SGB, said they had to intervene in 2017 to rescue the school.“We were forced to come to school every morning to make sure pupils attended classes and that they were taught. “The department must think about our children’s future, step up and appoint a principal who’ll turn things around,” Baloyi said. Sam Makondo, Limpopo Education Department spokesman, said they were investigating.
