THE excited couple drove all the way from Soweto to the popular Eyadini Lounge in Umlazi, KZN to formalise their engagement on Sunday. Lethu Semamagole (33) and Charlotte Mashau (29) met on Facebook in 2013 and have been together since. As the couple’s friends were excitedly taking photos and videos, some people in the crowd were heard asking why they chose KZN to announce their engagement. Many customers were at the lunch to see award-winning isicathamiya group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. They said they were angry because they didn’t accepted same-sex relationships. One patron said: “Why do you travel all the way from Soweto to do this here? This will create an impression that our province is full of gays and lesbians.” Another unhappy customer said the engagement shouldn’t have taken place in the province. “We can’t be viewed as a province that is full of gays and lesbians.” But Lethu said she decided to get engaged to Charlotte at Eyadini to make it special. “I understand that most people in KZN still don’t understand lesbians and gays. I knew some people would criticise me for getting engaged, but their criticism means nothing to us because we love each other.” Professor Jabulani Maphalala, a cultural expert, said: “KZN residents have not accepted same-sex relationships. “In the old days there were gays and lesbians, but they kept their sexuality a secret. This was a disgrace because KZN residents believe that a woman must marry a man and a man must marry a woman. “That’s why KZN residents are still shocked when the same gender couples get married.”
