FREE State Stars coach Luc Eymael concedes that they “cannot avoid rumours” linking him to Kaizer Chiefs. The Belgian has been strongly linked with a move to the Soweto giants in recent weeks – fuelling speculation that Steve Komphela’s future in Naturena is hanging by a thread.Although Eymael told SunSport that Amakhosi have never approached him, he acknowledged that the hype about such a move is mounting by the day.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssAo8oeZSi2uVcps5ejtmZ9fXwGGMSGJjd6VZgIG6o2hXuivI8hguul9Aldxk7WGG3TsQl-2ai1h4vUpJbYQ4SdALVvCxZydbQUC2Y2pwSortC0DUFs989INLJoCWxibiTUTTT4jWzVtE9GwroT9NzCSueRiR68nDyfTDRsBFYGYvTbwKhvC0ZJix9kwJZK7IxtPiATITCKXBbYaL4cfjnIij6zfck27ph-IzJNrlVjOc46SOZ5x2j2Op0laXj_Bd-aK56XQmjkEPfwZ5AMWrh7GQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIJsOrRQ_V0eEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Every week the media asks the same question and I am not a liar. The rumour doesn’t mean anything to me. I respect their coach Komphela and things are going well for me at Free State Stars. I also have clauses in my contract.”The 58-year-old insists he will have nothing to prove when his charges face Amakhosi in an Absa Premiership clash at Goble Park tonight (7.30pm). The teams will battle it out again in the Nedbank Cup semifinals on the weekend of 21 April. Ea Lla Koto registered a morale-boosting 4-2 win on penalties over National First Division side Ubuntu Cape Town in the quarterfinals of the Ke Yona Cup at the weekend. The league game will be an interesting one considering that both teams still have a slim chance of snatching the title from the hands of leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. Stars are in fourth position with 37 points, one point ahead of Chiefs, with six games to play. Said Eymael: “Our preparations have gone well. We trained on Sunday and players refreshed their legs with a massage after our return from Cape Town. We had another session on Monday and will have another one before the game. “I hope the players are motivated to play Chiefs twice. We don’t have the luxury to choose in competitions and we will take it one game at a time.”Eymael says the fact that Mzansi’s football fraternity has tipped Downs to meet Chiefs in the Ke Yona final doesn’t cause him sleepless nights.“Our target is to finish the season in the top eight and we are No 4, so we will wait and see what happens. Everybody on social media sees Chiefs and Downs in the cup final. We respect all opponents but still have a 50/50 chance of reaching the final.”
