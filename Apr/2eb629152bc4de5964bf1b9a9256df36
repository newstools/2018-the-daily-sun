COPS have once more
intercepted motor vehicles,  including a
luxury SUV from being smuggled out of the country at the northern border between
South Africa and Zimbabwe. They have also confiscated packs of illegal cigarettes at
different locations. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the Crime
Intelligence driven operation comprising members of the Musina SAPS and the
South African National Defence Force (SANDF) followed up information that led
them to the discovery of a BMW X3  in the
middle of the Limpopo River. The suspects abandoned the vehicle and fled to the other
side of the river. The vehicle was then retrieved and towed back to South
Africa. Ngoepe said the
operation was expanded to other areas of Musina after information was related
that there were cigarette smugglers using three vehicles. He said one of the vehicles sped off from the Baobab toll
gate and was found abandoned along the Waterpoort road after an intense car
chase. The other vehicle was cornered at Sebayeng next to
Turfloop in the Mankweng  outside
Polokwane. The suspect, aged 38 was subsequently arrested and
illegal cigarettes confiscated. Ngoepe said police recovered one VW Polo, one  Toyota Etios and seized 8831 Pacific blue
cigarettes straight boxes, 714  cartons
of illegal cigarettes to the estimated value of R 158 215. Police are still tracing the other suspects involved in
these incidents. "The Police Investigations into the ownership of the
recovered vehicles are still unfolding," said Ngoepe. The arrested suspect will appear before the Mankweng
Magistrate's Court soon. Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of
the suspects ,may contact Brigadier James Espach at 082 576 0743 or the nearest
