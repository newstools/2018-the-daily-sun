NORTH West Premier Supra Mahumapelo is a troubled man. Tomorrow, he faces a motion of no confidence in the provincial legislature in Mahikeng, brought against him by the EFF. Mahumapelo has also made enemies among his own comrades. His problems started when he fired some MECs in 2016. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuowhIFCxUKcBh--s1rrqg7PzOiKwRHp8Cd0DMVPOC3C5WpCGBDR3ekdCVmz6CJyHcpemBo7FUiyVfgNEZBYosorTwPIml3Sh4nkEFY9keJ2kmlAOmTq-sRpun-R0oCr0r-H3A7OzK0YLOTxzoiKxtUvh6cAt9k6qJGz4MDPZSNPojOT9jiNW1AUG8e2SQvemOAPaPzPfVSrVOgIj2gG9nj2I2ueyKSrn5VwlKBT9BuF2G6tq3uSiVqxbEXXWEHPhwYWRDPvxEPIsaCOs0yg_WxoSMhFD4C\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHbVwMxGH8HqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He alleged in a speech during Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s memorial service at Potchefstroom that he was introduced to the Guptas by Mahumapelo.The premier has also experienced marches by the North West Business Forum and Nehawu calling for his removal.Earlier this year the Hawks swooped on the premier’s office to get documents linked to an IT deal believed to have cost the state R215 million. This came shortly after a case of corruption was opened by members of the legislature regarding the R34 million given to Gupta-linked Mediosa.In that case, Mahumapelo admitted to having signed for a trip for the HOD in the North West Department of Health, but denied knowing about the upfront payment to Mediosa. What could save Mahumapelo is the announcement by the speaker of the North West legislature, Susanna Dantjie, that the ballot would not be secret. Dantjie said the decision to hold an open ballot wasn’t easy.It is not yet known if the EFF will go to court to force the speaker to allow a secret ballot.
