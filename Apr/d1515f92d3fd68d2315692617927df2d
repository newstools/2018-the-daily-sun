WITH the crowning of the National First Division kings done and dusted, the focus now shifts to the bottom of the table where it’s still unclear who will get relegated.With four games remaining, two of the bottom six teams will be relegated to the unfashionable ABC Motsepe League to follow former Absa Premiership champions Santos and Soweto giants Moroka Swallows who were relegated last season and in 2015-16 respectively. Mthatha Bucks are favourites to be chopped by the dreaded axe as they are at the bottom of the log on 21 points. In 15th position is Super Eagles who are on their first stint in the NFD. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstA45a7-7kyn1hooqs-OVj4hUsoq2_E_T5_sOCqXCCpRa_hu4vtjkYeSao_aQTBIEk4jOSehLpXVE3u9lVHtVm3M7ODPX65mBU6NSGchDHCYYwNdvHyKBqr2tRe34iyc44pGQXld90dHnivO_zGgdr2C4fPXrx8BqRcU4PoVVmrimuOojvTKN3zYWMyk47TCnZFS_E1fOeiH3dLgyMbPPnvSTM_0FOnpRXHQtHJXMZnQ1UzXWoXLO4xZDjnwXvAg_JHKgpG0KwgKpQrrOqMiA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAy7Cvf2H-YsEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Meanwhile Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila coach Sello Chokoe said they have thrown in the towel in the race for a promotion play-off spot. Mathematically Tshakhuma still stand a slim chance of finishing in the top three, but only if the top teams drop points. They are in sixth position with 36 points after 26 matches. On their maiden season, the Limpopo based outfit managed to set the bar high as they spent most part of the campaign within the top five. Chokoe said: “We started the season well and at some point we were confident that we could chase Highlands Park till the last game. But the last four games were disappointing for us. “The going was really tough and we conceded many goals. When it’s pressure time the boys struggled so we are not yet ready for PSL. Next season we will come back stronger and we will compete.”The former Baroka FC mentor also stressed the importance of signing enough players next season so that they won’t depend on other clubs to loan them players.“Most of the players we have now are on loan from other PSL clubs. Remember we had to gather players in the last three weeks before the season kick-off and that did not make things any easier for us,” said Chokoe.
