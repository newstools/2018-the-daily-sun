IT looks as if political parties could lose the votes of many people who live in shacks. Thousands of residents of the Abahlali Basemjondolo Movement of South Africa gathered at Springfield Park Sports Ground in Durban yesterday for what they called their annual Un-freedom Day rally. The rally takes place every year before Freedom Day. The members from KZN, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Eastern Cape said they refused to celebrate freedom without having access to land and basic services. Sbu Zikode, the movement’s president, said: “We respect the struggle of our heroes but we don’t feel free as we are still living under the same conditions as before. “We won’t vote next year if government doesn’t listen to us,” he said. The movement’s general secretary, Thapelo Mohapi, encouraged residents to grab the land by force without fearing the police. “We’ve waited for government to deliver on its promises. The time for waiting is over.” Busisiwe Nqithi (34) of Burnwood in Sydenham, Durban said: “Government failed to build us houses and now that we’ve built shacks they are fighting us. I won’t cast my vote in the elections next year.”
