My shack was better than this house.” Vala said water seeps through the walls when there’s rain. “We don’t even have running water and we use pit toilets to relieve ourselves,” he said.  “We were promised electricity and street lights, but nothing has happened.” Another beneficiary, Maleqhwa Mhlambi (44), said: “My circumstances are now worse off than before.”  Maleqhwa said her beautiful furniture has been damaged by rain because her roof is leaking.”  But Tshediso Maitse, a spokesman for the Dihlabeng Municipality, said: “The matter is being resolved by the municipality and the human settlements department. “On a weekly basis, water and the sewerage system are being connected to different houses.” Maitse said the municipality has secured funding from the energy department for electricity, which he said will be installed next year.  The premier’s spokesman, Tiisetso Makhele, told the People’s Paper: “It appeared as if the contracts concluded with Emendo Inc were irregular and, as such, they should be reviewed and set aside by a competent court.  “The provincial government confirmed that due process was followed in the appointment of Unital Holdings.”
