She needs sponsors so she can open a cinema ekasi! The 33-year-old from Mafora in Mangaung said: “I’ve had a passion for working with kids since I was a teenager. “I modelled and took part in beauty pageants, but I couldn’t continue because I struggled to get sponsors. That’s why I opened a game centre.“I used to see kids sitting on street corners and tuck shops, so I recruited them. “On school days I open at about 2pm, and during holidays they start coming here as early as 6am. “I teach girls modelling. I’m happy the kids’ families support everything I do. “My biggest problem is that sometimes the kids don’t want to go home.” She said it makes her happy to see kids smiling. “I’m glad they’re not involved in crime,” she said. “That’s why I want to keep them off the streets.
