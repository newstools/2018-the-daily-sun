THIS man is famous . . . but for all the wrong reasons. Pictures of a Kaizer Chiefs fan seen breaking an expensive TV camera at Moses Mabhida Stadium, Durban on Saturday have gone viral. Some people have joked that these are not the actions of an old man, others called him stupid and said he should be arrested. Some asked: “Ubaba kabani lo?” Javas Nkambule said on Facebook: “Is it true this camera costs more than R2 million?” Luthando Peko said: “Stupidity at its best.” Amukelani Golele said: “Here’s the evidence . . . arrest him!” MoPress Moloto said: “Take his house and his pension. “He must go to jail. Let him pay!” Mandla Hlengwa said: “Police are lazy. His face is evidence. He should be in jail like the Orlando Pirates fan. Arrest him now!” KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said they’ve taken note of the pictures on social media as well as the TV footage. “Our cops are busy with the investigation and arrests will be made once the necessary legal requirements have been complied with,” said Naicker. He remains the only person who has appeared in court regarding the stadium violence. Meanwhile, the portfolio committee on sport and recreation wanted answers from the PSL. Committee chairwoman Beauty Dlulane said: “The committee has taken note of all the statements and the pending investigations being proposed on this incident. “At the end of the day, the committee has a responsibility to conduct oversight where the interests and lives of South Africans appear to be compromised.”
