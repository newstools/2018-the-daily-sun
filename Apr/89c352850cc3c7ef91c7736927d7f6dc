FORMER Black Leopards coach Ivan Minnaert was released on R500 bail from custody in Polokwane on Tuesday night. The Belgian  coach was allegedly arrested in Gauteng  on Monday on charges of theft  for allegedly failing to return the Leopards car keys when he left the club in December after his contract was terminated.His relationship with the club is clearly beyond repair, as he has also opened a case of assault against Lidoda Duvha team manager Elijah Mulaudzi, claiming Mulaudzi hit him with a company car last year before his departure.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssaL3BpEX4JIIYLvIf0APnHjxLq6TLquArSJ3bepMALiKlvZm35sYM8EcOBpuKWX4yw9HjN1XCeH_DF5JGz760oj99oAXnlEwk44yYBOERjR18YRIQHjZ3-0AVSHsMIxDLDNUtEmm-UQWQ0vcFQTqh8eUonppPGl_V7FcZnwYrLuLuoZLiKpMhc21yU88CUqI37f0z1QFmXNgHpKjfVSehNE2Ckf-RrviNvdjB2UpEX6e9M90gvGJa2QusPJfVYEa35mb35C4nsPMyfkY7MXNOcWQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEAYnmmcbgcqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
