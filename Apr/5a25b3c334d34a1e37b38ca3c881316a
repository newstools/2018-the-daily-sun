THEY get all dressed up in their Sunday best and soon you find them dancing to the latest hits. Blue Heaven International congregants worship God in style. While many sing praise songs during worship time, they dance to Distruction Boyz. It’s not only the youth in the church but the priest and bishop are also seen shaking it up for the Lord. Mtimande Ngwenya of the Snake Park branch in Soweto is the priest seen in the video dancing ivosho. He laughed when Daily Sun asked him what they were doing in the video. The video was taken during the Good Friday service last month in Ermelo Civic Centre, in Mpumalanga. “We grew tired of worshipping God the same way. We wanted to do something that we would all enjoy. We are also trying to keep our youth away from taverns by bringing a fun element to church.” Ngwenya told Daily Sun they knew people would talk about their dancing. Since it was shared on 13 April, the video was viewed more than 10 000 times on Facebook. Nhlanhla Khoza said he was ready to go back to church as this was the kind of church he’s been waiting for. Babongile Ndlovu said she was ready to commit to the church and asked to be connected with them. While many people expressed excitement, some mocked the members, saying they were really party animals disguised in church uniforms.
