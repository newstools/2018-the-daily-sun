NIGERIAN pastor Timothy Omotoso has been dealt another blow by the courts.Prosecutor Zelda Swanepoel revealed in court that the Supreme Court of Appeal declined the application by Omotoso to overturn the ruling of Magistrate Thandeka Mashiyi, who denied him bail.The 59-year-old pastor, charged with rape and human trafficking, was denied bail twice after it came to light that he was a flight risk.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstXU5cvTIcfOIf6sX1FFEAVUEcs5lDCC9ef8Sxnpen7DR8htpaJQ4naG5zshSL-QKdLZqIVZxzSelm8uG47Yhhurna1W7c_ra7DS2ENhybweL4XDm7dSZwu0uwBuJ8k3OnX6h09REgXqfRvN2TZ0N4Ugb0C2gPHtFhwm6-TZhEXwIWHglNvDeDhnlNbxIxnhhpTECVJsvavYGJfcG6xlXCdA_0dp5HAnpcc1syfGCaEiPMsfhVH6SlUQZNFCrBodsRArCEBD0KH4CrIWdqTNbtYEfjc5Q0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOyrkFW5WHq0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We have been waiting for it a long time. I hope the state has postponed for the last time,” he said.Mashiyi postponed the matter to 15 May for authorisation to centralise the case and for the matter to be transferred to the Port Elizabeth High Court.
