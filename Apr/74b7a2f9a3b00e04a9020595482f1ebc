The party held a two-day congress that saw the hopes of Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga dashed after he was trumped by Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip, who retained his position as federal council chairman.The congress was attended by 2 000 delegates from all nine provinces. DA leader Mmusi Maimane described the congress as a watershed event of the party which marks the beginning of the campaign for the 2019 elections.“We must take the issues of the many millions who do not yet vote for us, and the things they face in their lives, very seriously,” he said.
