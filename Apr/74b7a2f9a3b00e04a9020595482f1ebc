This comes after the DA passed a resolution at its congress in Tshwane over the weekend that empowers the party’s federal executive council to recall its deployees.The congress resolved that should a president, premier or mayor lose the confidence of his or her caucus, the federal executive council may recall that official.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuNetq6Pf9uFcPvku_X2rKbchLHb8-xi1PQfrQmMUEIMB_Ub7Ggvr6wyrY7IAeel7SwwRzZmmqYdyeNF4Wec-xlNzTOZ1NfxjNzVsRkfIsd2e49RDXrQsDmsRFd8GHvNV_giAIpWZVOBmVajBCUC8j_NLbo72RtuRcpObRzVRVEwE8jdWolT2ymphN4v0XvvLwQP0h-2v0XRiqEFi1f30VtDUUvxTXxioDiE7FNRe411qFCrdV8g32hC6HWlSCJ43T3_gRdq_tM5hvQV7dLVir_Je0Ry92O\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEaXzH_6OugWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The party held a two-day congress that saw the hopes of Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga dashed after he was trumped by Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip, who retained his position as federal council chairman.The congress was attended by 2 000 delegates from all nine provinces. DA leader Mmusi Maimane described the congress as a watershed event of the party which marks the beginning of the campaign for the 2019 elections.“We must take the issues of the many millions who do not yet vote for us, and the things they face in their lives, very seriously,” he said.
