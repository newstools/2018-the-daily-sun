FORMER Kaizer Chiefs winger Mandla Masango sits idle at home frustrated and with no job for almost eight months.According to a source close to the player, Masango has been club-less since he left Danish side Randers FC in August last year after he fell out of favour with the coach.His career blossomed in the 2014/15 season while he was still playing for Chiefs as he won the club’s Top Goal Scorer Award with nine goals and Most Improved Player Of the Season accolades.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvkq-dq4NTDElQaxcVMrA8HZS0L75TmQxs_vNGTmFG1y3kgXlD2b6cSxI_koNqobZtijtBL6JWoXyayrYXB7AaXYDEH-B1HPN_KXJFQhxR-V1HYlLRVth8v3EmqXSWEXJ9sBUFbaIrjoqQXqvdq7uF_HcaJq2leJpws8rDjbSGs_08WqXjlwT8VmRPGPk6Dca3RMMTaoqrqbwoyGqytDsaPV7Wi3Vi-UEhH90nALQOGTun0IVwBfTQ1jDwbuYiEBxnPpYucac097e19HNUQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzL3oUZTBMFw5EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But he struggled to obtain a regular place in Randers which led to a six-month loan move to SuperSport United in January last year.The former Bafana Bafana player returned to Denmark in July last year hoping to take his career to greater heights only to return home miserable.Said the source: “Masango’s been around for seven months now. He had a problem in Denmark as they were no longer paying for his accommodation. He asked management to return home.”But Masango has himself to blame for his fate. He turned down an offer to join Cape Town City in January.Added the source: “City management were prepared to pay him a good salary, but he turned it down. Pirates assistant Rhulani Mokoena had shown some interest, but the chairman wasn’t prepared to sign him.”Asked for comment, Masango said: “I’m not prepared to talk right now. I’ll call you when I’m ready.”
