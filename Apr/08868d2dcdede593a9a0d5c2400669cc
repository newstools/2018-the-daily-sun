Cristiano Ronaldo scored an injury-time penalty to send Real Madrid into the semi-finals of the Champions League in dramatic circumstances as they lost 3-1 to Juventus on Wednesday but won a thrilling tie 4-3 on aggregate.Juventus looked to have staged a stunning revival to force extra time after Mario Mandzukic scored twice in the first half and Blaise Matuidi added a third on the hour mark after a goalkeeping clanger from Real's Keylor Navas.The goals cancelled out Real's resounding 3-0 win in Turin a week earlier but Lucas Vazquez won an injury-time penalty and Juventus goalkeeper and captain Gianluigi Buffon was given a straight red card for venting his fury at English referee Michael Oliver.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss72euGkvJUjNM-DWrP4Is0WabsazvD2zvMtgQOn_XCDH_lZrkTeYMic2JMpceKsA26neyX8-oHYv8cR1A582SwyIP4QWcAWBxA7xCwW4yKk0Eu8nAWiim7YSg_Qy2AxllWcPgN4zqICW4BF9S3e0p52CkMLup1pmAJH3A22nMi6__yhjAAkHrtd00imotm_DNCyj2dxSPrE2lxqvrgDqmwUb--R4YB-CfBSy_9jTMSrvu1Ve_llA4t698IsCS4Xuhy_IClMS_pTRj2KHYNKw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKyNCompQ2dKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
