Cristiano Ronaldo scored an injury-time penalty to send Real Madrid into the semi-finals of the Champions League in dramatic circumstances as they lost 3-1 to Juventus on Wednesday but won a thrilling tie 4-3 on aggregate.Juventus looked to have staged a stunning revival to force extra time after Mario Mandzukic scored twice in the first half and Blaise Matuidi added a third on the hour mark after a goalkeeping clanger from Real's Keylor Navas.The goals cancelled out Real's resounding 3-0 win in Turin a week earlier but Lucas Vazquez won an injury-time penalty and Juventus goalkeeper and captain Gianluigi Buffon was given a straight red card for venting his fury at English referee Michael Oliver.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvMCdEGrF8A2StPuj6DVLCMfltuSF58Oyhmrc6Kr4SZtNwRE6pmYGyoK-9ZUKk-1Jd8xHVlOQPJsOd__I9kL74qhxpiWHB_-FBLB-QOlSDD_e6j054P4iEa3VkXsjKA6OZcWD5rJCyjKXfat_zrc78LfSoGOvPIpnSKxfACWs77tXIhWeGFPOZrfAGn3C1BIyuKVF7QK8Mur-DjHMphX_BeOsmLsormmLLA8KL8R3fTWFH7OAZsraRO6n8XSP-UrF5nYlTpOn0banj48ltObA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMn3AFniDrdGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
