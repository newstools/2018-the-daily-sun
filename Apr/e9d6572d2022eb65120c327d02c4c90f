THEY pay R1 500 rent every month although it is their house. And they pay the money to somebody who can’t even prove she’s the owner! “This woman came to our home in 2013 and told us she had bought the house,” said Charles Ngobeni (60), one of the siblings who live in the house in Chiawelo, Soweto.“She told us to move out but we refused because we’ve been living here since 1966. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuLVU4qUobd8oi3WpTZ-DagxgciuarPR55iw-XycndtTYffiuCBjtMgyEB58rOFjuLQZBeXI3kNkV8uyxjcmGbJwQu8JXiAALMuXn66Wnp5C83u9q2L0Y3U8ThAMuBLpl_T8UA55Lm8Wyy6-ydgnqiopvsugRVDMqWtAMZp5DsbWc7_EVv1rlg9jNX4si1caxHh1aJfHYfDpM6r6KovJXmmWcRo9VI7FwbeXCn4LDyTa8Kq8UbxZpoSdI63d7eExjEG55Msu3itXOVzyIFvtbu0UURQvnI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCHHKUqHtJioEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They’ve been paying her since 2013.Charles said his younger brother Victor (56) took a loan of R150 000 to pay Baloyi but she decided they had to pay R250 000. The community has come to the aid of the family and demanded that the woman provide documents but she didn’t have papers.“We are old now and we are glad the community has stepped in to help us,” said Charles.Luzuko Pongoma from Human Settlements said once people have title deeds the government can’t intervene as it’s a private matter.“We will, however, go through the system to check who the rightful owner is to clarify the matter.”Baloyi said she bought the house through an agent. “I took a loan at the bank and I’ve been paying it since 2010. I’ve asked them to move out many times. That’s why the councillor told them to pay me rent of R1 500.” Meiske Maluleke, the councillor and the Ngobeni siblings’ cousin, said she wouldn’t do such a thing.“I don’t even know why they would accuse me of such actions because I’ve been defending them even before I became a councillor.”
