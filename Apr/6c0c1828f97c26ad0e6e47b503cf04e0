THE FACTS Zacharia Mphikeleli signed up for debt review some years ago and due to them not assisting with paying his debt he paid off the debts himself. He has now paid everything but his credit record still shows that he is under debt review. He wants to know how he can clear his name. WHAT I DID I spoke to SCORPION LEGAL PROTECTIONÂ for advice. SOLUTION Zacharia needs to go back to the court to have the debt review cancelled. He must apply for rescission of the debt review. Once the order has been granted by the court, the debt counsellor should complete a 17.W form which notifies all creditors of the withdrawal of the debt review. He should forward a copy of the order and the form to all credit bureaus to update their records. The process of delisting his name should take 20 working days. If the credit bureaus do not clear his name within the prescribed time he can report them to the credit ombudsman. Should he find that the debt review was done without a court order he can also refer the debt counsellor to the credit ombudsman. to fill in your details for Scorpion to call you back.
