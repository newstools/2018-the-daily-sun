The 30-year-old from Khwezi kasi appeared before the Mthatha Magistrates Court yesterday after failing to arrive for his previous appearances. Gawula was bust last January and charged with assault after apparently burning his girlfriend’s face, stomach, thighs and hands with a hot iron at his house on 25 December 2016. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst6_NBNRH55_lpNUNiGTpKTVoMT7oV3kDB-9TjraAHHIU0Pd46bWhEl5GwTLUrNN7arxK2pQEz3Wcm7IQWAP45p5cAQMIfPPN0CM8xnWcqS2UDlGqoztVP24aMkYGVldE8wXEv4MJbbfIFU9yjZOgoJkTA7htf0jtwPq7VPi6dnsAZfe7C0Nnef41n1ItOJBYWcIatfDhp7UMQXa95VDZJqxPZOpSC8z1kEpEW7_ZpYx0NLpEQGvhybAvP9gAiojG1bGgMbKrwSxqMysDY7GJCfW5tktPA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPsfd-LH7CYHEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

During his appearance yesterday, Gawula wore a dirty white short-sleeved shirt and spoke softly when questioned. He chose to defend himself after being told by the court he couldn’t be represented by a Legal Aid lawyer. He asked for the case to be postponed because his brother was supposed to bring documents supporting his case to court but had not arrived. He asked for a week’s postponement, saying some papers were coming from Joburg. Prosecutor Nomava Buso said a week was too long as Gawula is from Mthatha and his documents must be in the area. The magistrate warned Gawula against manufacturing a story about his documents. The case was postponed to 17 April.
