RETHABILE Mokhanya left home with her older sister to buy a few things at the nearby supermarket in Marikana, Philippi in Cape Town on Sunday afternoon. But the 12-year-old girl never made it back home. According to witnesses a speeding taxi knocked her down and dragged her tiny body along the road. Horrified residents who witnessed the accident cornered the driver and started beating him. Rethabile’s dad, Nico (33) told Daily Sun: “The incident happened in front of her older sister Katlego (15). We had sent them to buy something to cook for supper.” Katlego rushed home to tell them what had happened. “We rushed to the scene but we were too late,” said Nico. “My daughter was already dead. Her bones were broken. She also had a big wound on her head.” Rethabile’s mum, Buang (32), fainted when she saw her daughter’s bloody body. A witness said Rethabile was walking on the pavement when the speeding taxi knocked her down. “Her older sister was walking right next to her but she miraculously escaped completely unscathed,” said the witness. Angry resident Ayanda Mamani (37) said: “The taxi driver should thank the security guards who came to his rescue. “Residents wanted to kill him.” Nico said they didn’t know how they would bury their child as no one in the family has a full-time job. “We have to take her body to the Free State but wo don’t have the money because we survive on piece jobs,” said Nico. He said if it was up to him, he would not press charges against the taxi driver because that wouldn’t bring his daughter back. Philippi police spokesman Captain Bheki Xulu said: “The driver was arrested but released to appear in court.”
