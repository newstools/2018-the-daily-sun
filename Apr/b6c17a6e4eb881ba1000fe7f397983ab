THE FACTSWinnie Motlhatlhedi said her husband passed away on 11 July 2017 and had a business account at Standard Bank. She said she obtained a letter of authority for the estate and then claimed the balance of the bank account. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Instead, she was informed the account has an overdraft of R60 000 and because they were married in community of property she is liable for the debt. She said she was forced to pay it and was also advised it would gain interest. She wants to know if it was fair for her to have to pay the debt as it was a business debt which had nothing to do with her. WHAT I DIDI spoke to SCORPION LEGAL PROTECTION to get professional advice. SOLUTIONIf Winnie was married in community of property, both her and her husband are joint owners of their undivided estate and they both share in the profit and loss of the estate. The husband’s business is also part of the assets and upon his death Winnie applied for the letters of authority and therefore became the executor of the estate. This means she is responsible for winding up the estate of her deceased husband including paying all the debts incurred by her husband’s business. As such Standard Bank is justified in asking her to settle the R60 000 because the debt formed part of the estate and that she is also the executor responsible for winding up the estate.You can strike back legally too!Click here
