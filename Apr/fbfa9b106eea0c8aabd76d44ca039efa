A 2-1 Absa Premiership home victory over struggling Ajax Cape Town on Tuesday did not only ease the relegation pressure on AmaZulu, but also made their players believe in themselves. They now have some faith that they can actually achieve their top eight goal. A goal by Mhlengi Cele and own goal by Siyanda Zwane in the second half saw Usuthu pass the magical 30-point tally to reach 31 – and players are now certain that they are safe from relegation.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssPlPkmh7TAP45HkTGu6Apf23VjcaatkFprhh6jNsoLhhwdU3XUOYpRZCOaAg5g2fy0_h_Ku35gULdaz78pSE_8J_Ww-DT1BCBAAQoZeUAR9ORpepGk-KJEyjzGa2JjB18vTj3CeJAXoX3-SgY2Oy7It1IpA27lFVweLEwycsuVbZtqldwmoHIieORjgvP0IN3UjyM1G8-teML3SU5yFQEdhYsnA8A1mlvzDUmwIpSTulmvImF1HwrWmVcsRlXA2Dxjibdh5vwCB0VYuvuKNcYABgc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP53dyHCh-U-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Usuthu’s best finish since the inception of the Premier Soccer League in 1996 is position seven in 2012. Their first top eight finish was in 2009 when they ended eighth. The Ajax win left Cele and company with high hopes.Said Cele: “At least now we can shift our focus to that top eight finish. It was important for us to beat Ajax. They are below us and we needed to win. For us the Ajax match was a decider. We knew how precious three points from that match would be for us. Now the pressure on us has eased a little bit and I believe our relegation worries are behind us.”Cele, who received the Man of the Match award for the first time in his professional career after the match, said the sky’s the limit for them now. He says victory over the Urban Warriors gives them the courage they were looking for ahead of their clash with stubborn Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr Molemela Stadiu on Sunday (3pm). “Not only did this win ease our relegation worries but it also gave us the belief that we can finish the season in a very good position. “If we continue winning our home matches, I’m sure we can achieve a better position than ever before. “When we face Celtic we would be happy to come back with at least a point. They are not an easy team to face – especially in front of their home fans,” added Cele.The former Chippa United and Thanda Royal Zulu striker said he aimed to score his sixth league goal.
