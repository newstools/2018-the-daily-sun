The public order unit of the SAPS is already on site," Phokane said.Earlier, Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu said, "There is a backlog of about 6 kilometres. Traffic has come to a complete stand still."Mngomezulu said the N3 northbound had since been opened, with police attending to other routes.Provincial spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said people from a nearby informal settlement were upset about not being employed by local truck companies.The N3 Toll Concession confirmed on its Twitter account that the highway had been opened going north, but southbound still experienced "extensive backlogs".SOURCE: News24
