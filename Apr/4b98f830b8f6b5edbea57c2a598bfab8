A man was assaulted and robbed by three suspects on Todd Street in Verulam in KwaZulu Natal. It is alleged he was assaulted for failing to pay an amount of R80 for services provided by a local magosha. Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) spokesperson Prem Balram said they were called to the scene and upon arrival RUSA members arrested the suspects. According to Balram, the 30-year-old victim said shortly after leaving a pharmacy, he was approached by the woman who claimed that he had sex with her sister. "She demanded R80 for services which her sister provided. When he denied the allegations the woman left and returned with two men," Balram said. The three began assaulting the victim before stealing his wallet that had an undisclosed amount of cash and his cell phone. Balram said when they noticed Reaction Officers approaching they fled, however two of them were arrested. The victim's cell phone was found in the female suspect's possession.
