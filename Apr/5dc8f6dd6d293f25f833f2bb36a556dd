A 28-year-old man was allegedly stripped naked and robbed of his belongings by a person he met on the internet and three accomplices when he was lured to a flat in Tambotie, Johannesburg on Easter Sunday.The man was robbed of his two cellphones worth R10 000 each, cash and his bank card, said police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela."It is believed that after stripping the victim, the suspects took pictures of the victim using one of his cellphones and threatened to publish them via his own social media account, should he [fail] to cooperate and part with his bank card," said Mavimbela.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst4J_muyskRF3tUEBA00ZPRPaC5gScEsRPS2zV6KQbjjdFv049yCE_8LsCBENNFO6ILv0IuqblbwTA3Hsu7bYstFSB86PGpPt--VDETfghIOBLK_sdRas-bY3nLPyAIGWwj_9-0CQTB9gIGsYq5JiMWY39uNpz7AAtANNJlW75OyXJ7u4ca76KDx2GtBvDFcFb7xecSk4luqcAMlsG2AQCUMC2AAqBooHCXllTLUvp1nIslSlYqkCJBUvEgtuNswCae66hLpaNMCBTzXQgZO51LDbjtb0s\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzE98EIp4JrwyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Such meetings must take place in a public place," advised Mavimbela.News24Sourcehttps://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/gauteng-man-stripped-and-robbed-by-internet-friend-20180402
