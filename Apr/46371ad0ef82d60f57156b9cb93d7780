One of the bullets hit the girl in the chest and she died at the scene. He said officers were investigating the circumstances.   Two teenagers were killed in a separate shooting in Uitsig on Tuesday night. Van Wyk said the pair, aged 15 and 18, were returning from a tuck shop when a white vehicle with no registration number stopped near them. Four armed men got out of the vehicle and started shooting, killing the teenagers. "A 19-year-old victim was taken to a nearby hospital," said Van Wyk.
