TWO relegation-haunted National First Division (NFD) clubs, Mthatha Bucks and Richards Bay FC, have continued with the chopping and changing of coaches – at this crucial stage of the season with only three matches left. Bucks are languishing at the bottom of the table with 21 points from 27 matches, while the Rich Boyz are just ahead of them in 15th place with 28 points from the same number of matches. These two sides seem to be battling to cope under pressure and are among the NFD clubs that have changed coaches more than twice this season. Bucks parted ways with Duncan Lechesa two weeks ago, replacing him with Julius Dube, and now, with three key games left in the season, Rich Boyz have sacked their coach, Jean-Francois Losciuto. Losciuto was shown the door on Sunday following their 2-1 loss to Super Eagles. Talking to SunSport yesterday, the Belgian mentor, who impressed in his first stint in Mzansi as coach of Black Leopards last season, confirmed that he got the sack on Sunday. Losciuto joined the KwaZulu-Natal outfit last November. He said: “I am very disappointed with the way things have gone. All I wanted was to prevent the club from getting relegated, but the management had another plan. “When they broke the news to me I could not refuse, they had already made their decision. “There have been a lot of changes since my arrival and we were heading in the right direction, but now there’s nothing we can do. I am out.” The sacking of their coach could come at a heavy price. Bucks could drop down to the lower division should they lose to Jomo Cosmos at Mthatha Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Richards Bay too will need all the points when they visit Black Leopards at Giyani Stadium. The two teams that finish at the bottom will be relegated to the ABC Motsepe League.
