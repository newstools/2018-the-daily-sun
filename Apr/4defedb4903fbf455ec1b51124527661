THANDI Mtsweni is a relieved young woman. The 26-year-old from Kwaggafontein, Mpumalanga has won the battle against nyaope addiction. Thandi said she started smoking the drug after losing both her parents when she was in grade 11. “I couldn’t face life alone in this world as a young girl. “After my parents died, I mixed with the wrong people,” she told Daily Sun. “I smoked nyaope to get the satisfaction I needed since I felt empty. There was a big hole in my heart. I couldn’t even concentrate at school and ended up dropping out. “I felt like the world was weighing heavily on me and I couldn’t take it anymore. Smoking the drug for five years made me look like a zombie. “I smoked nyaope until I felt that my body was no longer taking it. “It nearly killed me, but I am glad that I eventually won the battle.” She said she went to the South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence offices in the area for help. “I’m glad that I visited the organisation because today I’m clean. “Since becoming sober, the community has accepted me back with open arms.” Thandi said it’s not too late for addicts to stop smoking nyaope. “They just need to follow my example and go to the organisation for help.”
