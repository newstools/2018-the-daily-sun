THE most anticipated strike is set to hit Mzansi on Wednesday morning and cops are warning those who have mischievous thoughts to behave. According to the cops, the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (NATJOINTS), comprising of various government departments and law enforcement agencies, has put security measures in place following  information of an imminent strike by the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) nationally. This follows preparations by SAFTU for tomorrow’s national shutdown over wages. In a statement issued by the National cop’s spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, he said Law enforcement agencies nationally have been advised of their roles and responsibilities particularly in respect of crowd and traffic management on Wednesday (25 April 2018).  The mandate of the SAPS demands of us to lead the process of securing gatherings and to allow all South Africans to exercise their democratic right to protest, picket, participate in a strike action without any fear of intimidation or any other forms of criminality,” he said. “Those who will participate must  do so within the confines of the law and in a responsible manner. Those disguising themselves as protesters but are joining only to cause mayhem and commit crime, will face arrest and prosecution,” he said.
