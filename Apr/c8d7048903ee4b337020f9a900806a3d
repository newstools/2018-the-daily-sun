We’ve been very cautious [in the past], but this year, we’re switching things up and being a lot more aggressive in what we’re putting out. We’ve got a crazy amount of collaborations,” said Trey.The boys say although all of the singles they will be releasing this year will culminate in an album, they are not focusing on an album at the moment.“The album is there but because we’ve been working our thought process isn’t geared towards the album. We’ll just see how things happen and unfold, how the songs do. Then we can decide from there,” Trey continued.Watch as they chat about all their plans for 2018.
