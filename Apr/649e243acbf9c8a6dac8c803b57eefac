GOGO Tsakani Chabalala (67) was asleep in the early hours of Wednesday morning when she heard a sound in her kitchen. She immediately suspected something was wrong and grabbed her panga. The brave gogo switched on the kitchen light and was shocked to find a man stealing her things. But when the man saw the gogo’s panga, he dropped everything and fled. Gogo Tsakani from Makuleke Village outside Malamulele, Limpopo told Daily Sun: “The moment I heard the noise in the kitchen I knew there was an intruder and I grabbed my panga. “I found a tall man stealing my things and the moment he saw my panga, he fled the scene. He escaped through the window which he had used to get into my house. “He was lucky to get away because I would have hurt him. He must thank his ancestors I didn’t catch him.” Gogo Tsakani lives with her daughter and four grandchildren, but they were asleep when the incident happened. Another villager, Glory Chauke (36), was not so lucky. She told the People’s Paper: “I’m angry because a thug broke my window to get into my house recently. He stole R500, two cellphones, clothes and groceries.” She said she did not hear a thing when the suspect broke into her house, but only discovered she had been burgled when she woke up in the morning. Limpopo police spokesman Moatshe Ngoepe advised villagers not to take the law into their own hands. “Villagers should open cases of burglary so that cops can investigate,” he said.
