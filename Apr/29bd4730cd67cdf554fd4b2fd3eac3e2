There was more laughter than tears yesterday when friends and relatives of Odwa Shweni gathered to remember the actor. At a memorial service in Randburg, Joburg, his cousin, best friend and brother described Odwa as helpful, humble and responsible. So many mourners attended the service that some had to be seated outside. Odwa died last Thursday after falling from a waterfall while filming a movie in the Drakensberg, in KwaZulu-Natal. Although she shed a few tears, Odwa’s wife Tebogo remained composed while sitting next to her mum, Margaret Mashika. Sipho Singiswa, the director of the film, was also seated among the mourners. Family member Feziwe Shweni said: “I never imagined, even in my wildest dreams, that I would be standing here one day. “Odwa was full of love. He was oozing with affection.” Friend Thamsanqa Bokwa told mourners it still hadn’t sunk in that Odwa was gone. “He was a great man. For me, it doesn’t feel like he’s gone. I feel like I’m going to call him now.” He said whenever they went out, Odwa would volunteer to drive as he didn’t drink. Odwa will be buried in Queenstown, Eastern Cape on Sunday. Meanwhile, the portfolio committee on arts and culture has called for safer working conditions in the film industry. Committee chairwoman Xoliswa Tom said rules regarding filming in dangerous areas needed to be reviewed. She said: “Shweni’s untimely death raises questions about the safety procedures used during filming and rehearsals.”
