RIAAN van der Merwe (35) was down and out when he got help from a place he never expected. After being kicked out by his landlord, the unemployed mlungu had nowhere to go. But a friend offered to help. Today Riaan lives in Maluleke squatter camp, Tshwane. He told Daily Sun he had lost all hope when he met an old friend of his girlfriend, who told him he could rent his shack. “After visiting the place, I decided to move in the same day,” he said. “My neighbours were so supportive when I first arrived in the area. They showed me where to fetch water and buy food.” “A lot of people have been encouraging me to apply for an RDP. “The squatter camp is my home.” He said everything was cheap in Maluleke. “With R200 I get from my parents, I’m able to buy food that lasts for two weeks. “The beer is cheap, and I like the music played at the taverns,” he said. He said even if he could get a good job, he would still live ekasi. Neighbour Mashako Selaluke (40) said Riaan is a friendly man. “He is also a good dancer.”
