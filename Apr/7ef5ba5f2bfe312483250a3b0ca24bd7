The robbery takes a deadly turn when a customer makes his way to the till to pay. Unaware that a robbery is in progress, the customer fights back when one of the men approaches him and searches him. A scuffle then starts between him and one of the armed men. Another armed robber then runs to help his friend and shoots the customer twice. Before the robbers flee, they shoot at the customer again, who is lying on the ground. The customer died on the scene as the men fled with an undisclosed amount of cash. Tebogo Magoro of Netcare 911 said paramedics responded to reports of a shooting in Klopperpark. “On arrival at the grocery store, paramedics responded to the man, believed to be in his mid-40s, who had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the upper body. Tragically, his injuries were fatal and he was declared dead on the scene,” he said. Bedfordview police spokesman Captain Andre de Jager said police had opened cases of murder and business robbery. He said no arrests had been made yet and the investigation continued. “We request community members who might have information that could assist the police to come forward.”
