THEY told her to dance and then they raped her! The 16-year-old girl was walking along a railway line in Welkom, Free State, on 24 February when she was cornered by two men and raped. Cops spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng told Daily Sun: “We’re searching for two unknown men after a girl was raped. “The girl was walking behind the railway line next to the Welkom Market on her way to Bronville at about 9pm when she was approached by the two men. “She was instructed to dance and thereafter raped by both suspects. “She later reported the incident to the police.” Thakeng said no arrests have been made, but an identikit was compiled.
