He was also carrying a Bible.“I always carry my Bible. I keep my ID and other documents in it,” the man told Daily Sun.“I was going to buy a Ford Bantam bakkie. I had been saving the money for quite some time and I was excited. I wanted to start a delivery business. Now my dreams are ruined.”Before they could complete the transaction, four men stormed the dealership and held up the victim and the dealer. The dealer was robbed of R7 000. Then they raced away in a black Mazda 6. But they didn’t get far.The car rolled down an embankment on the R59 near the Sasolburg off- ramp, leaving two of the occupants dead. The other two were taken to hospital with serious injuries.But the money was gone and nobody knows what happened to it. The only thing found in the car was the victim’s Bible and his documents. Sasolburg police spokeswoman Constable Josephine Rani told Daily Sun the other two suspects, who were badly injured were taken to the local hospital, one of them by helicopter.“We opened cases of armed robbery, culpable homicide and possession of unlicensed firearms which were found on the suspects,” she said. “The suspects are under police guard and will appear in court once they are medically fit.”According to the cops, the Mazda 6 used during the robbery was hijacked in Ekurhuleni some weeks ago.
