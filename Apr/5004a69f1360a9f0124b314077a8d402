who is reportedly her ex-spouse. The perpetrator is reported to have then
turned the gun on himself. Both succumbed to their wounds," she said."Learners who witnessed the incident are greatly, and
understandably traumatised, as are the teachers' two children."A school psychologist and social worker will be dispatched
