Some people have even opened churches and others sleep there without the city’s permission.Resident Peter Mbazo (43) said the government was wasting time.“These structures had been built for a long time. What were they waiting for? “We need houses. They should give people empty shacks so they can live there and no one will be hurt.” Lesiba Mpya, MMC for Human Settlements in Ekurhuleni, said progress had been halted by court orders and pending cases.He said residents of Angelo were currently living on private land.“We had discussions with the land owners and they paused the eviction until we could find a place to temporarily house the squatters.“We found land and erected the temporary structures. But business people and residents of the area near the temporary houses raising concerns about property depreciation and business being affected. We had to pause the project pending the court’s findings and decisions,” said Mpya.
