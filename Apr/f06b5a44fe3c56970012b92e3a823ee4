All I want is for this man to support his baby.     ) Sister Hi SisterLet’s be real! You trapped this man into fathering a child. You made a selfish decision and now your baby is facing the consequences of your lack of responsibility. Sister, a child is not an accessory that you have when you want to “complete” your womanhood. Talk to your family about approaching his family on this matter, and if you don’t succeed you can go to the maintenance court. In the meantime, try to give your kid a good life.
