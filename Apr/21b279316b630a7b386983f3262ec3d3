KWAITO singer Arthur Mafokate was back in the Midrand Magistrates Court in Joburg yesterday. He was appearing on assault charges laid against him by his ex-girlfriend and former artist Cici, whose real name is Busisiwe Thwala. The assault allegedly took place in June last year. The singer previously described how Arthur allegedly dragged her across his driveway while driving off after an argument at his home in Midrand last year. Arthur laid a counter assault charge against Cici. She has pleaded not guilty to the charge. Yesterday, the prosecutor recused himself from the case. There has apparently been a breakdown of trust between the prosecutor and Cici. The case was postponed to 11 May.
