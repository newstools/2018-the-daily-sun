SOCIAL media etiquette in your relationship can be a grey area, but the #1 hardcore rule is that if your ex is still in your profile picture – it’s time to update it. To delete or not to delete? If you still have photos of you and your ex on social media and haven’t given it any thought to remove them, it’s no big deal. After all, they’re part of your past that arguably shaped you into the person you are today. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>And often whether the photos are still there or were removed has a lot to do with whether the break-up was amicable, right? Although for some people, once a break-up happens it’s literally the first thing they do. Take Selena Gomez and The Weeknd. We were holdings thumbs and thought their relationship had long-term potential. But after just 10 months of dating, things fell apart and both started deleting posts of the two of them faster than me untagging myself from an ugly photo. And then others will delete the photos or posts only when Facebook randomly decides to show them as memories on their timelines. But when it comes to your partner, maybe they fear that you haven’t taken the time to remove them means you’re still reminiscing about your distant past or, worse, you still have feelings for your ex. Or is the bottom-line that they’re insecure and raises a little red flag? Or, just maybe, their request is totally warranted. Yes, they were once a part of your life journey, so maybe you feel it’s not okay that they totally disappear. There’s really no big and it shouldn’t be an issue, says Louis Venter, intensive relationship specialist and founder of Couple’s Help. “We meet each other at a certain time in our lives and embrace everything about each other, including our past experiences. “So, I think it’s unreasonable for one partner to want to ‘erase’ their partner’s past.” But Venter said there can come a time when it’s probably best to consider your partner’s request or discomfort. “If I love someone, I would make their journey with me as smooth as possible, even if it means deleting images of my ex. After all, it’s an ex and shouldn’t be a problem.” Is it something worth arguing about? Certainly not, explains Venter. “Something like this shouldn’t end a relationship. Communicate your needs and feelings with each other.”
