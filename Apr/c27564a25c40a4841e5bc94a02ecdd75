PREMIER Soccer League's Disciplinary Committee have finally made a judgement on Orlando Pirates following the crowd violence at Loftus Versfeld last year. The incident took place over 14 months ago, when Pirates fans stormed onto the pitch while vandalising the broadcasters' equipment as the team was humiliated 6-0 by Mamelodi Sundowns. The PSL DC initially reserved their judgement, and on Tuesday ordered the Pirates to play two of their home matches behind closed doors, with one of these suspended for a 24-month period. "The Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned Orlando Pirates by ordering that the club must play two home matches in a closed stadium. The implementation of one of these matches has been suspended for a period 24 months," read a statement released by PSL on Tuesday. "In the Disciplinary Committeeâ€™s opinion, the sentence was warranted because of the seriousness of the misconduct. "In addition, the Disciplinary Committee was of the view that a sanction of this nature is the only way in which the fans of the club could be punished simultaneously with the club, for their errant behaviour during football matches."
