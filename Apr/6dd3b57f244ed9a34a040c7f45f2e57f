THE Post Office will now be distributing social grant money. Sassa has acted on the Constitutional Court ruling that declared the Cash Paymaster Services tender invalid. It was instructed to source a new service provider. A pilot project to roll out new Sassa and Post Office cards was launched yesterday at the Soweto local office at Maponya Mall. This saw all new social grant beneficiaries at the Soweto office being enrolled on the new system. The new cards will be used for payment and withdrawal of social grants as from next month. Social grants recipients with old Sassa cards are advised to keep their cards safe until they are called for new cards. Also, beneficiaries receiving their grants in their personal bank accounts will be called for new cards.
