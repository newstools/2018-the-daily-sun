A FEW kasi pupils won’t feel the freezing weather this winter. MultiChoice donated windcheaters to pupils at Mkhanyiseli Primary School in Nyanga, Cape Town on Wednesday. Nokuphiwa Udoakpan, the regional manager of the company, said giving back to the community was a priority for them. “We do this project twice a year. We identify schools, old age homes and other places where we can make a difference,” said Udoakpan. “By doing this we want communities to know we’re thinking about them and we’re grateful for the support they give us.” Simon Ellis, regional customer care manager, said: “We had a budget of R50 000 and I’m happy that covered the majority of the kids in this school,” said Ellis. The school has 1100 pupils and jackets were given to those from grade R to five. Grade six to seven pupils didn’t get jackets because their principal said they would soon be going to high school. Ahlumile Hlaba (6) said he was happy to have a new jacket. “At least we have something to wear since it’s been raining lately.” Principal Malusi Dyantyi said: “This donation shows the company isn’t only focused on profits but cares about its subscribers.” A parent, Nombeko Gojela (56), said: “We are so happy because some of us didn’t have money to buy our kids winter jackets.”
