The last time I saw her was on 22 March. We agreed that we would meet after the Easter weekend.” Life Esidimeni family committee member Christine Nxumalo confirmed they were going to meet with Mama Winnie after the Easter weekend.Deputy president David Mabuza later told the crowd gathered outside the house that the only way South Africa could honour Madikizela-Mandela was to unite.Mabuza said the mourning period wouldn’t be an exclusive ANC affair. People from all political parties would be given the opportunity to visit the house to pay their respects.
