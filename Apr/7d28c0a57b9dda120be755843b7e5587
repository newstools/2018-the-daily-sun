The 40-year-old claims mayor Jeremiah Ngobeni promised to give him a tombstone. It’s been a year since Karabo was buried but his grave is still unmarked.“There’s nothing on his grave to help me identify his final resting place,” said Ruben.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssMY_KlxPF9c4Wfvv9BRifdn4Eoxrk_eTB0vl0FhJj8_cNNQD5zB_LUwXyveafbrj34rbSs0LVWIZu9OZa8rgsakZpsRiq75ACTzlyI6rsIdk9D9V-JzRwJTqSogOYOBDJFgWQKS_0wtFx8QlEhdo5g5DHepYk5o8cLlD-CJyPR-zBQUVhkF_Is1FUwrqFDxGiEr696Ez5gh58x1pNu_MfaPVm6Ey_ixXjjcWpBfgLzSFnAWGmOdq7toJ43bCqj8qXld3rswsRP64IUOI19Y4loIa81nBM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEhNEaB_6ht8EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I will never let them get away with that. It’s hard for me to live without him. While we are still waiting for the matter to be concluded in court, my son’s tombstone must be erected.”Ngobeni said he was not aware of the promises made to Ruben.“There were a number of councillors who attended the funeral and I don’t know what they said to him,” said the mayor.“I visited the family after the boy’s death. When I found out the boy’s mum was unemployed, I decided to employ her. I agree that the tombstone is necessary but let’s wait for the court to make a ruling.” Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokesman Moses Dlamini said their investigation into the matter was completed and the docket had already been sent to the director of public prosecutions. It was decided that an inquest must be held.Dlamini said: “According to the investigator, the mother of the child was updated about the developments in the case.”
