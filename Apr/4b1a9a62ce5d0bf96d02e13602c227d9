THE Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it supports the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) and urges all workers to join the nationwide strike. THE SAFTU national strike will be held on Thursday, which is aimed at amending the National Minimum Wage. ALSO READ: SAFTU TO EMBARK ON NATIONAL STRIKE! "The government has already imposed VAT, Sugar Tax, Fuel Levy and all other manners of taxes to resolve an economic crisis that the workers did not create." "the very same government proposes that the NMW for all workers should be R20 per hour, even less than the minimum living wage that was the findings of the research from UCT in 2014," EFF National Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said. Ndlozi said the African National Congress (ANC) claims to advocate for Radical Economic Transformation and yet their proposed bill will further entrench poverty. He said this will cause the present inequalities to remain a permanent feature of our nation. This is clearly an attack on the labour force of South Africa and a deliberate programme to further oppress our people. "The EFF calls on all workers to support this mass strike action and we demand better standards of living for all workers in South Africa as was promised by the current ruling party," Ndlozi said.
