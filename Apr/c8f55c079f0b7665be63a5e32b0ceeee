STHEMBISO Kubheka’s life changed forever after she fell into a hole filled with water last month. Sthembiso from extension 4 in Bethal, Mpumalanga, spent two weeks in ICU and now has to be supervised all the time. The hole was dug during a toilet construction project. “It’s a miracle she’s alive,” said her dad Mandla Nhlapo. “I hope that when we take her to a specialist on 5 May, the doctor will help her make a full recovery.” Mandla (36) blames the Govan Mbeki Municipality for his child’s injuries. He said the hole his daughter fell into had been open for almost two years. Sthembiso’s gogo Nomvula Tshabalala (60) said: “She doesn’t play outside anymore. “We have to lock all the doors because she might go missing if she leaves the house.” Councillor Brenda Mahlangu said residents were told about the project ages ago, and she advised them to keep an eye on their kids. Daily Sun emailed questions to Govan Mbeki Municipality, but no response was received.
