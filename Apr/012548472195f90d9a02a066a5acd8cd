is an action of last resort and isimplemented after all other mechanisms have been exhausted
and have failed to deliver therequired outcomes," Rand Water's Justice Mohale said.He said Rand Water is
sensitive to the impact that this will have on consumers, the local economy,
and other affected parties.Mohale said the implementation of this credit control action
against the municipality will reduce monthly consumption then minimising
further escalation of the debt due by the municipality.
