The journey to the 24th annual South African Music Awards is well underway. With most of the nominations being announced last week, all that is remaining is for the top categories to be announced. The organisers of the awards have announced the candidates for this year’s Record of the Year. The SAMA24 top 20 shortlist for Record of the Year point to a dominant dance culture and a thriving hip hop industry. The nominees were announced on SABC1’s Live Amp last week Friday, kick starting a public vote season to determine the winner. Rapper, AKA leads the pack with three nods. His monster hits The World Is Yours, Caiphus Song and Don’t Forget To Pray featuring Anatii give AKA a trifecta of songs in the running. While Lady Zamar flies the dance flag high with two nods for My Baby and Love is Blind. Kwesta also comes through with his two hits Spirit featuring Wale and Ngiyazifela Ngawe featuring Thabsie. House DJs and producers are also shining bright in the Record of the Year category this year. Prince Kaybee received the green light for Charlotte; DJ Zinhle with Colours featuring Tamara Dey; Heavy K for Inde featuring Bucie; DJ Kent on Love You Still featuring Domini; DJ Maphorisa with Midnight featuring D; and Black Motion with Imali. The biggest summer anthem, Omunye by Distruction Boyz featuring Benny Maverick and Dlala Mshunqisi has found a spot on the prestigious list.
