He told Daily Sun: “I don’t let my disability limit me and neither should anyone else.” He said he wanted to motivate the youth to follow their dreams as no one else would do it for them. “I’ve got two fingers and I’m doing wonders. Imagine what you can do with 10?“You can do 10 times what I’m doing,” he said. Roto is a club DJ, a singer, fashion designer, motivational speaker and a soccer player.NGO founder Ntombi Shezi thanked everyone who made it possible for her organisation to have its own premises. “We were given land by the councillor and some people donated containers. Now we have a real centre,” she said.
