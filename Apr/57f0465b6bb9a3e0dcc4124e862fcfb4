The former Platinum Stars and Ajax Cape Town player will only start playing again next season.“To be honest, I was starting to play well and felt I was getting my game back on track,” he said. “And then this injury happened. It has been frustrating to be out there and not playing. “The other thing that has frustrated me is watching the team struggle, knowing I could have been helpful.”He added: “But I have been healing well and will start with light physical training to gain my strength. I am expected to join the team during the pre-season for next season.” Grobler said he was confident that Pretoria-based side would move away from the relegation zone.“I have no doubt that we will move to safer ground,” he said. “We have good players and a good coach in Kaitano Tembo. I have gone to training to see the guys and I can see that the confidence is back, they are ready to fight for the team and move away from the danger zone. “They look refreshed and extremely motivated.” Grobler confessed that he felt bad about the departure of Eric Tinkler at SuperSport.Tinkler resigned last month following the team’s dismal form in their domestic run.“I don’t think Eric did badly. It is just that we played many games and travelled around the continent in a short space of time, and we also had to adjust to his style of play,” he said. “After the African Confederation Cup final, you could see the boys were tired and we still had a league match to play. “Sometimes football is not fair. I still think Eric is one of the good coaches in the PSL.”
