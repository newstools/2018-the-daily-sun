ASPIRING content writer Fikile Shabalala says her dream of having her own TV show was shattered when she saw a concept similar to hers being aired on Mzansi Magic on Tuesday.  Fikile from Jabulani in Soweto believes Mzansi’s recently launched show titled Yobe is similar to the one she sent a proposal for to the channel in 2016 and again last year. However, Mzansi Magic’s head of publicity and social media Nondumiso Mabece said Yobe is based on a concept that was originally submitted by the show producer Siyabonga Thwala to Mzansi Magic in 2014. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstYK1h62xa0rFyt9bzlomQf97OKFjMwj2C2ic06hiBnBwGrtC_sBWofrVpgoOHJugtl1rwbW-Z7zxOEWku-toNDPkxIBBbqa_KYKl5uJOELuSP1Gift8p_lL-Df0VfmpTXg1I2WPnbJr1nJB0UMiJ0WTFKDUibA3pDkiY-AZaFsFPcFCk9xxICyV55gxvOS9loB3Q64PxCdpQzM-r0D0GrdhxosQF7UEo00-pSLvZcqf_T3xPVo-iCbaasxUZEMp3_x7Hlqrs8-Wfqu7ViJN2FjJrKiHDt1\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMKyemxVNybBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Fikile, however, disagreed with Mabece.“What I’ve realised is that most of these shows are produced by the same production companies,” she told the People’s Paper.“Small or unknown production companies are not given a chance.”
