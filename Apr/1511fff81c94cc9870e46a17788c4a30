ASPIRING content writer Fikile Shabalala says her dream of having her own TV show was shattered when she saw a concept similar to hers being aired on Mzansi Magic on Tuesday.  Fikile from Jabulani in Soweto believes Mzansi’s recently launched show titled Yobe is similar to the one she sent a proposal for to the channel in 2016 and again last year. However, Mzansi Magic’s head of publicity and social media Nondumiso Mabece said Yobe is based on a concept that was originally submitted by the show producer Siyabonga Thwala to Mzansi Magic in 2014. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvE3sOcOVCGy_x0EhWINvWOlVefvaGM8GGyHMRAtBkifSCXZKC389_wQmzKzupGEvARqismlIyE7OXgrbXcR_VEEox5rNhJFRR4pzIp_nUJN0C0op-K1dm5f9M18H6tYhQZf_cNRKuVYeNfSR3XJVkrueFWurdap21zGeW17pMkFMMoJh53B561h8QQGceVhDaOMrigT8glf48hBCG9mQ3gxdDNEM2_5snRWcCNV4rgEbKYIj9kcEf0xGXTO7PCW9vhmDtqKDx4-9khAlVDWrSl5qya8_c4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFXNg2RV6dYPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Fikile, however, disagreed with Mabece.“What I’ve realised is that most of these shows are produced by the same production companies,” she told the People’s Paper.“Small or unknown production companies are not given a chance.”
