ASPIRING content writer Fikile Shabalala says her dream of having her own TV show was shattered when she saw a concept similar to hers being aired on Mzansi Magic on Tuesday.  Fikile from Jabulani in Soweto believes Mzansi’s recently launched show titled Yobe is similar to the one she sent a proposal for to the channel in 2016 and again last year. However, Mzansi Magic’s head of publicity and social media Nondumiso Mabece said Yobe is based on a concept that was originally submitted by the show producer Siyabonga Thwala to Mzansi Magic in 2014. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuA5omMXYKxVObJHTy6LhdDWzEwrc0u3LKW_ebqDZUbWRTTd08PeXnL_TsZjJNWccmWw8cx3JxvZBm2P6eTtN4vG0Qh2EPThHwKsX9__H0TZLwwhDf0fqv7RFBiqtjKm-H4Z7qOyjHya_TsFOpJRhpHFDedhsVYcjRX_l6WGQ0OjvKh2IlyJhAmHFRsLrLuYEdhUDCESMVoV3_w6ZD5gpGCykxi5uJCt7OY2y4wbMftNNvOksqU5Axj0MYKyMBgZCM0LAGtqqfuKE7E1VVvVCyxkLSVjBM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBf4PEjTho_EEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Fikile, however, disagreed with Mabece.“What I’ve realised is that most of these shows are produced by the same production companies,” she told the People’s Paper.“Small or unknown production companies are not given a chance.”
