ASPIRING content writer Fikile Shabalala says her dream of having her own TV show was shattered when she saw a concept similar to hers being aired on Mzansi Magic on Tuesday.  Fikile from Jabulani in Soweto believes Mzansi’s recently launched show titled Yobe is similar to the one she sent a proposal for to the channel in 2016 and again last year. However, Mzansi Magic’s head of publicity and social media Nondumiso Mabece said Yobe is based on a concept that was originally submitted by the show producer Siyabonga Thwala to Mzansi Magic in 2014. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstgGh1Nw_iC27iW9lWXAAcB3u23gnqWZKJIj6GwCdgjQ0SzSwdgi1EHTIlKG6IyRedk1B_FVLNyz9R9mpFSmaiXtS8jz0zjKOCP5Fa41bmKSJZPj6HfYkLyrrhjr3eBDoI57-ASVPrZDqsm_BCKb2fmZqI3AE9w_sLC8cqju1v0jZVBtUCpvongqhKkEXNg1688qS_HH9Pn14cSc4YZf88oplC5pElp-SK2Vy57wjfEmjy9aPWb7SxrpFQ9kew_aIDNfINGhOLOdHBV5Isk7kpyZdRr9Nv2\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGvQgXjzgVPfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Fikile, however, disagreed with Mabece.“What I’ve realised is that most of these shows are produced by the same production companies,” she told the People’s Paper.“Small or unknown production companies are not given a chance.”
