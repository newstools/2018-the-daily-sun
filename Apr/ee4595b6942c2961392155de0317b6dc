ON Tuesday, over 50 people living with disabilities from ward 99 gathered at Tafelsig Community Centre in Mitchells Plain. The idea was to teach them about our heritage. Councillor Bongani Ngcani said: “People with disabilities are mostly left out and no one cares about them.” He said he’s put aside R50 000, so disabled people could visit heritage sites like Robben Island. “Having disabilities doesn’t stop them from knowing Mzansi’s struggles and victories.” Yonela Moni (34) said the event gave them a platform to discuss their challenges and share possible solutions. “First of all, no one cares about us unless they want something from us,” said Yonela. “When they want us to go to voting stations, they send transport but after we have voted for them, no one ever thinks of us again.” Luyanda Sunduza (33) said: “People should respect us and know we have feelings, just like them. We hope there will be more events like these.” “There are no opportunities for us. We are not treated well at all, and hope this will change soon.” The disabled group said next time, they’ll invite others so they can discuss their problems.
