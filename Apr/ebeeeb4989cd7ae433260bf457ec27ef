GRANNY Madikoe’s family is angry with the Limpopo Department of Health. It’s been two weeks since Granny (48) was admitted to Voortrekker Hospital in Mokopane after a speeding car hit her and broke her hip and leg. She hasn’t been treated for her injuries. Granny’s sister, Daphney, said: “She was admitted on 29 March but she hasn’t been treated. Nurses have told us that there are no orthopaedic surgeons at the hospital. “They said she would be transferred when there was space for her at Mokopane, Mankweng or Polokwane. We are worried her broken leg, which is swollen, may rot. The hospital is doing nothing except keeping her in bed. How can Panado heal a broken leg? “It is painful to see my sister suffer like this,” she said. Limpopo Health spokesman Neil Shikwambana said the patient is being seen and managed appropriately in line with the medical protocols. He said there is no delay in operating on the patient as that is not the first intervention required. “While we may have a shortage of orthopaedic surgeons, in this case, it has been handled appropriately. The patient will be operated on in due course. ‘Our doctors found that the patient suffered from other conditions. These need to be attended to before the patient can have an operation,” said Shikwambana.
