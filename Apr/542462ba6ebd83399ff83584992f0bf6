AmaTuks have gone six straight league matches without a win and suffered a humiliating 5-1 defeat to NFD champions Highlands Park at the weekend. “I did all I could working on our goal this season. “But things did not go our way,” said Bartlett.“I am not sure what will happen to me at the end of the season. “We will sit down with management and see if I will still be here or not come next season. “In football, as a coach you know when you sign a contract with a club that you are not safe. “But I believe I did my job to the best of my ability and it wasn’t to be this season. “So let’s wait and see what will happen at the end of season.” The former Arrows head coach said he cannot blame anyone for his team’s dismal season.“I cannot point fingers at anyone,” he said. “We were not consistent and that’s what cost us. “Another problem is that players did not execute the mandate which were given to them well. “We lost many games that we could have easily won. But we did all we could.”
