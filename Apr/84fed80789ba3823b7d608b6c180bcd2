I HOPE you’re enjoying family time this Easter because some people are in turmoil and really, sometimes, it’s their own fault for not being more committed. Some poor woman was crying about finding out that her man of eight years is married. Wow! Was he living overseas? This is why you should always know your man’s location – whether you trust him or not. If your man says he’s off to the loo,expect a flush or he’s lying. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstI8_kNoDVUXF0Iti_88JMrRpdMVs563kguS6dAc2W5Okef9daXNTn-Yn9TNG8yLISvBrvH6QISV1E6qVaL16QhekIhjqQwMlKoeaKl35w5MUL0BKPli3auFQftf2zmZgexuJ0j77KqdaWhlqDylewncegxapnH5gAWqmiYl7QEmiDsFv4hfSVbP6rKdKEycyl9yBFQZ0INg1FY2p2bjcLDulYbAwLM1Qv-rYkQWEtFc6fAcUelHsEaqXmZJgg-YPMgZyWP2IbkslcuhW3Dtpg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPNno2ORFP0aEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Ensure your man isn’t cheating on you with a wife by knowing his colleagues, so you can call them when he doesn’t answer. His friends should also be yours, so you strengthen your bond and ensure you have no competition. Make your man accountable for asking you out and spend every moment you can with him. Know where he is and sleeping each night. And if he only has sex with you once a week, he has a wife. Also ensure you are visible in your man’s life by feeding him. Yes, ensure meals are shared. Have hobbies together, so you ensure you have loads in common, and never let him hang out with his male mates alone. Your boyfriend must have you as an appendage, if you’re to ensure he has no wife. So, spend weekends together playing golf too. If your boyfriend insists on going on family visits in the rural areas, then send him with your daughter if you’re out of town. Make the union known and post on social media, ensuring you tag him. Always ignore a man who insists your relationship should be private while he’s always reaching out for your privates. Plant your panties in his pocket or use your picture as his display picture. Claim your place and don’t be anonymous because he’s possibly hiding a wife. If he joins the gym, accompany him so you’re part of the new routine. Yes, spend time with daddy, and when he’s not with you, get a drone to follow him if that’s what it takes to avoid the humiliation of being cheated on. Confronting him is futile, so if you suspect he has a wife, track his car and man bag. One female with a personalised number plate was continuously humiliated as her mates watched her lover visit his girlfriends while driving it. Look men, we’re tired of being humiliated, so stick to one family this Easter.
