LIKE so many other budding musicians, Skroofman from Pienaar in Mpumalanga dreams of hearing his songs on air. To get on radio, newcomers have to work through middlemen called promoters. That is exactly what Skroofman (29) did. Skroofman, whose real name is Surprise Nkosi, said he paid R6 000 to two promotors. The promotors promised to get his hit track Khanyi Mbau playlisted. They even promised to get him magazine coverage. None of their promises has been fulfilled Surprise said he trusted music promoters Trevor Yende and Nyiko Dubula. “I met them through a friend and I know they are good at marketing musicians. I was expecting big things from them, but they disappointed me,” he said. Surprise said the duo promised him air time on radio stations such as Jet FM and Eldos FM. They even promised to get his music on SABC1’s Live. According to Surprise, the promotors told him he would appear in Naeto World and Child of Coco magazines. “If they don’t want to do their job, they should just return my money.” Daily Sun spoke to Nyiko, who said the first thing Skroofman should know is that promoting artists is not cheap. “I charge R25 000 to manage artists. “I usually do not manage up-and-coming musicians. I have managed big artists who appreciate my work,” he said. Nyiko said Skroofman paid him only R1 500. “I don’t owe him. All I have to do is draft an email to tell him how the money he paid me was used.” Trevor Yende said he received R1 800 from Skroofman. He said he charged artists roughly R10 000 and Skroofman could not afford his services. Trevor said: “He should take his music to the media instead of trying to ruin people’s reputations.”
