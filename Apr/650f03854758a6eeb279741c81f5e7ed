RESIDENTS said the roads in their village are crumbling in front of their eyes. Residents of Shoba Village in Vryheid said they don’t know what is damaging the gravel roads. They said they started noticing the small cracks in January. However, they did not think it was serious. Last month, they realised how bad the situation was. Resident Mpiyakhe Gubhela (61) said he could not believe his eyes when he saw one of the roads breaking up. He said: “I was sitting under the tree when I noticed the gravel road next to my house was cracking. “I stood up and looked in disbelief. “I had never seen something like that before. “I thought I was dreaming, so I asked my neighbours if they were seeing what I was seeing. They came out and we were shocked by what was happening.” Another resident, Hlengiwe Mzelemu (43), said the situation made it hard for motorists to drive to the village. “What scares us the most is the fact that this happened when there was no rain. “We cannot sleep at night because we fear our houses will crumble as well. “We have reported this to the municipality,” said Hlengiwe. Abaqulusi mayor Jerry Sibiya said he’s aware of the matter and is dealing with it. He said: “I went to Shoba to inspect the roads. “I contacted the provincial transport department about two weeks ago. “The department promised to attend to the problem. “I contacted them again last week and they said they will look into the matter,” said Sibiya. KZN transport spokesman Kwanele Ncalane said the department received a report about the roads in Shoba. “We are attending to this matter,” said Ncalane. “We are still going to send our officials to assess the situation and work out how it is going to be solved.” When the SunTeam asked Ncalane when the residents should expect the roads to be fixed, he did not give a clear response. He said: “There are processes that have to be followed.”
