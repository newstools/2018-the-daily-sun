THE City of Tshwane has denied that hundreds of jobseekers’ CVs were dumped. This comes after documents were seen being scattered from the back of a municipal bakkie. Earlier this month, the municipality advertised hundreds of jobs, leading to thousands of young people applying for work. But there was anger a few days later when the images of application forms being thrown from the back of a bakkie in Hammanskraal were shared on social media. Many youths called Daily Sun to complain that they had spent money to make copies of their CVs, and had queued at cop shops to certify copies of their documents. Africa Maleka (23) said: “The municipality is playing politics with people’s lives and it’s wrong to use desperate people for their dirty games.” Municipal spokesman Selby Bokaba said city manager Moeketsi Mosola had called for an urgent internal investigation into the way application forms were transported. “The investigation was prompted by the circulation of pictures on social media showing the forms being packed and loaded before delivery into the back of an open van,” he said. “They were being packed at the city’s offices in Temba to be transported to the recruitment office’s one-stop centre in the CBD.” Bokaba said the investigation revealed the pictures were taken by an applicant queuing to submit a form. “The applicant saw a city employee loading the forms onto the bakkie. “The city has satisfied itself that all the CVs which were loaded into the van were successfully delivered to the centre.”
