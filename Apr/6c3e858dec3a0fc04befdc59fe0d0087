FOR many years Ndala Myeni (39) and her two kids, aged 12 and 19, lived in a structure that looks more like a kraal than somebody’s house. But their lives have changed, now that their municipality, with the help of an unnamed donor, has built them a four-roomed house. The donor learnt about their plight through a councillor. Ndala from Biza Village in Jozini, northern KZN, said: “I can’t remember how many times I’ve repaired our mud house.” Part of it would crumble when there were heavy rains. She’d fix it herself because she didn’t have any money. “I can’t believe I now own such a beautiful house,” she told Daily Sun. “Not even in my wildest dreams did I think I’d ever step out of a decent house, let alone having a bedroom I don’t have to share with my kids.” The camera-shy Ndala, who’s a cleaner, only earns R700 a month, all of which goes towards buying groceries. Municipal manager John Khumalo said almost every month, they build a new house for a resident in need. “I was so touched when I learnt about the plight of this family,” he said. That’s how they started negotiating with mayor Delani Mabika to build the Myenis a house. __________________________
