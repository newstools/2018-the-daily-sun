Once investigations are complete we will take the legal route to deal with the people involved,” said Gaba.People said they had paid R8 500 for stands. “I bought the land from Mandla Nangalembe. I never thought he would cheat me,” claimed a buyer who did not want to be identified, fearing retribution.Other buyers also said Mandla allegedly told them he was with the Wildebeesfontein Evaton Community Organisation, known as Weco.But Mandla claims he has done nothing wrong. and is being persecuted.Mandla told The People’s Paper they do not sell the land to the people. “We help them to get land.“We try to find people who own land and negotiate with them. If we can’t find the owner, we declare the space unowned and try to get the land into the hands of the people. The R8 500 is money to do all the running around and to get the administration sorted out.”Mandla said people are accusing him of fraud because he is black.“A black man is always a suspect. When you do things for people without any benefits you are considered a fraud.” But people said they had paid cash for land and denied contributing money for administration.A woman said she brought the land for R8 500 and erected a four roomed shack for R14 000.“I was excited that I finally had my own home. Now I am heartbroken and homeless. I don’t know where to go.” Another buyer said Mandla told them he was with Weco. “I bought the land from Mandla and his committee. They said he was elected as Weco president on 7 April.” But a member of Weco said Mandla is selling land they don’t own.“Weco doesn’t own land. The issue of land without compensation is being debated and we have pointed out land we will claim when the issue is resolved. But as things stand now, we don’t have land and we never intended to sell it to the people.”The man had papers showing that Nangalembe was fired by the organisation because of a number of transgressions.
