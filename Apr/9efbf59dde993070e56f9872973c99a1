When they came back on Monday, two church members realised that the main switch was off.“That raised concerns and when we went to check, we found the entire sound system was stolen, including the amplifier, the keyboard, the speakers and the microphone.“The thugs even stole things from the kitchen and that will affect our feeding scheme. Kids used to come to the church twice a week to get hot meals.“Now they won’t because the gas stove and the fridges were stolen.”Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed that police were investigating a case of business robbery. He said no one has been arrested and the police were looking for the suspects.
