A group of men who tried to hijack a couple on the East Rand in Gauteng had the tables turned on them this week when the owner of the nearly hijacked vehicle smashed into their getaway vehicle. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said the couple was about to leave their driveway in Van Dyk Park, Boksburg, on Thursday night, when they were accosted by armed men and forced out of their vehicle. "The suspects could not reverse the car and ran back to their getaway car. The male victim jumped back into the car and reversed into the suspects' car," he said. CCTV footage of the attempted hijacking was widely shared on social media. The footage shows the suspects leaving the house and heading towards a white getaway car parked on the other side of the road.
