FOR three long months, the Mkhwanazi family lived with a snake in their house. And it turned out it wasn’t just any old snake but one of the most venomous in the world – the dreaded black mamba! The family from Inanda, Durban, believe the snake was comfortable in their home and felt it was part of the family. It did not try to hurt them. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Senzo Mkhwanazi (32) said they started suspecting there was a snake when they saw its skin in one of the shacks in December last year, but when they looked they couldn’t find it.  On Sunday, they saw its head in the corner of the shack but left it where it was.  On Monday, they saw the snake was still there and called their older sister, who advised them to call a snake catcher. Nick Evans said when he caught the 2m long mamba it didn’t become aggressive. “I believe it loved living there. It was easy to catch,” said Nick.  “I’ll release it in the wild far away from humans.”
