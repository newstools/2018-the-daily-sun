Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said: “The department calls upon families‚ friends and people to assist in the recapture of these fugitives.”Nxumalo told Daily Sun a case of escaping from prison had been opened. The SunTeam learned that the men had allegedly committed murder, rape and robbery.Two of the men believed to have been among the 16 thugs who escaped on Monday were killed in a shoot-out on Tuesday on the R33 in Greytown, KZN.Yesterday Hawks spokesman Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said: “Their identity will not be revealed until their families have been informed of their death.”Mhlongo said the organised crime unit received a tip-off about the men and the suspicious car they were driving.When the cops, the tracking team and the K9 unit approached the car, the men fired at them. The cops returned fire and the two were killed.“Joburg cops have been informed and an investigating team will confirm the suspects’ identity in KZN,” he said.
