OLIBILE Shelile is a very busy man. The 44-year-old from phase 6 kasi in Mangaung is known for his tasty ox livers. But that is not the only thing Olibile offers. He also sells kotas and runs a cleaning service company. Olibile, who has a stall in the Bloemfontein CBD, told Daily Sun: “I have a catering and waste management company, but I also love preparing and selling good food to my customers. “Customers enjoy my ox liver because I add green and yellow peppers, onion and the right spices. I often sell the liver with pap. “I charge between R25 and R35 for a plate that includes salad.” Olibile said he operates from 6am to 6pm during the week. Customer Sabata Lome (39) said he often buys ox livers from Olibile’s stall. “I have a lot of iron in my body and it is thanks to Olibile. “He knows how to cook the liver. I can’t get enough of his tasty meat. “Olibile is one of the best cooks in the area,” Sabata told the People’s Paper.
