She has done a lot for our people and we are here to say we are in pain together with the family.”Asked about some of the members who seemed not to be sober, Makiti said they joined them on the way. “Those who are drunk are members we picked up on the way. They decided to join us because they love the church.” The members were granted permission to enter the premises.Makiti said he prepared a special sermon for the family which he didn’t want to reveal as he had not met with them. They sang “Ba ntebetse, ba ntebese ko kerekeng, bare nna kenwa jwala, khanti jwala a se sebe, sebe sona ke tjhelete” (they’ve chased me away from church because I drink booze, but it is not a sin: the love of money is the root of all evil).“On our way, people asked if we won’t be chased away. Here we are. We’ve been allowed to come and mourn with the family and we are grateful for that. We aren’t drunk. We only drink during our own services,” said spokesman Nigel Lehasa.
