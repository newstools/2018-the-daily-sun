The councillor from Umuziwabantu in Harding, on the KZN South Coast, said the previous councillor, Ace Houston, was gunned down in December 2016.

Mndela told Daily Sun he started getting threats towards the end of last year. He said local women told him three weeks ago that three men came looking for him at his home. “I’ve noticed the car they said the men were driving following me many times,” he said. “The women told me the men sped off when they tried to question them.”“That same month, a local told me I was not going to live long and I reported it to the Harding Police Station. “I’m not planning on reporting the matter to the municipality because I don’t believe it will help.”Cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed that a case of intimidation was being investigated. “No arrest has been made at this stage,” she said. Umuziwabantu mayor Dixie Nciki said she was not aware of the matter. “I encourage Mndela to come forward and report the matter so it can be investigated, and so that we can assess whether he needs to be provided with security,” she said.
