The road was still closed yesterday morning. Passengers waiting at a bus stop allegedly tried to signal the bus to stop but because it was allegedly driving at high speed, it couldn’t stop in time. When it finally came to a halt, it hit Simphiwe, who was crossing the road.Residents told Daily Sun Simphiwe wasn’t the first person to be knocked over on the busy road.Thandeka Madlala (45) said: “On weekends we can hardly sleep because cars come and spin on this road because there are no speed humps.”Sipho Mchunu (43) said: “Several councillors have come and gone and we asked them all to have speed humps installed but they didn’t.”Councillor Njabulo Mabanga said speed humps would be installed soon, but he couldn’t give a date.KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed that a group of 300 people blocked the road.“The situation is calm and no damage has been reported,” said Mbhele.She also confirmed the accident. “A case of reckless driving and negligent was opened at Ntuzuma Police Station for investigation,” said Mbhele.
