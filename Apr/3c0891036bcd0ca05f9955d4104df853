THOSE hoping to see the back of Steve Komphela had better not hold their breath.The Kaizer Chiefs coach is not the type to run from responsibility.Frustration reigned for disgruntled Amakhosi fans on Saturday, who resorted to the old tactic of hurling objects at Komphela to express their unhappiness.

What would happen to the players if I run? My responsibility is to own up, help the players, protect them and see to it that things become stable. Losing points is not nice.“We will have to keep fighting – we have to get points in all the matches left.”He admitted, however, that the anger of the fans may not necessarily be misplaced.Chiefs have been inconsistent this season, losing matches they shouldn’t be losing at home. But this latest defeat has taken them to new lows and Komphela will have his work cut out to lift the gloom ahead of the next match against Platinum Stars at the same venue on Saturday (8.15pm).Against Chippa, Chiefs had no answers to goals by Thabo Rakhale, Mxolisi Macuphu and their former striker, Edward Manqele.“You can’t be oblivious. Chiefs have never lost 3-0 the way we lost,” Komphela said. “There is no way to explain what happened. Do we expect to see fans throw roses at us? That would be unfair of us.“The level of expectation is clear. I’m not the kind of guy who runs away from responsibility.”The Soweto giants have dropped to fourth in the league, equal with third-placed Maritzburg United on 39 points, but have a far better chance of securing silverware in the Nedbank Cup.The PSL’s Lux September said: “What we saw was not good. The league has to wait for thee commissioner’s report, which will be referred to the league prosecutor for a decision on whether or not to charge anyone. Even though there have been similar incidents in the past, no two are ever the same.”
