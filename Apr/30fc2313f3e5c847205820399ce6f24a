MEMBERS of the Maliyavuza Ubuhle Bengcunce cultural governance group meet every month to celebrate the ancient cultural practice. Dozens of girls lined-up in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni at the weekend, ready to go through ukuhlolwa (virginity inspection). The organisation performs virginity tests to make sure that young girls don’t indulge in sex at an early age. The process also involves teaching them life skills and how to handle themselves as women. They are encouraged to take pride in their virginity. Young parents are also given tips on how to take care of their children. More than 500 girls from all over Gauteng as well as other provinces are members of the organisation that was founded in 2012. Founder Maliyavuza Buhle (46) said the organisation aims to preserve the culture and heritage practices our forefathers left for us. “There were too many misconceptions around the cultural practice. “However, African people have been practising virginity testing for centuries,” she said. “We encourage abstinence and sexual responsibility among unmarried young women. “The practice also helps curb teenage pregnancy and the spread of HIV/Aids.” Nomfundo Ngubane (21) – who passed her virginity test – said her parents were proud of her. “They are happy that I have a great respect for my body,” said Nomfundo.
