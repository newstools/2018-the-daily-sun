We are monitoring the situation closely and are looking for suspicious activities.”Xako said they believe the attack was linked to gang initiation. He said a gang member was transferred from St Alban’s in Port Elizabeth to Goodwood.“When he arrived, he told them he was a general where he comes from but then he had to prove it, so he attacked one of our members.” He said razors and sharpened toothbrushes were used to attack the wardens. Other homemade weapons were found during a search of the cells.“We confiscated four knives, a cellphone, two chargers and blades hidden in a mattress, which were going to be used in a fight.”
