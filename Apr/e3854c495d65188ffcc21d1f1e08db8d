I rushed home but found almost all their belongings were eaten by fire.”“The tenants all denied leaving anything burning so we don’t know what really caused it . Even the neighbours did not see where it started,” said Joe. He said it means tough times for everyone as he wouldn’t be able to rebuild the shacks straight away.“It’s a huge loss. They lost all their belongings while I lost my shacks.“ I can’t say when I can rebuild them.”He said some tenants had found shelter at neighbours’ houses since he couldn’t accommodate them all. “It was very difficult when they went to work today. They were left with only what they had been wearing.” He said they could do with extra clothes, blankets and food.eThekwini Municipality’s Mandla Nsele said: “We can give affected people a helping hand but the first step for them is to report it to the disaster unit through a phone call or a ward councillor. “The unit will take it from there.”Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “Nothing was reported.”
