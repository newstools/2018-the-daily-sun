She loved the song very much and so we asked Vusi to join us. We chose the voice we thought would go best with the song and that was Vusi's. Me and Mzwakhe will perform it at the memorial,” Chicco told the publication.Social media users have already expressed concern that Mzwakhe, who is known as a notorious high-profile “funeral hijacker”, would try to steal the show at mam’ Winnie’s memorial and/or funeral.But Chicco told TshisaLive that there will be no such thing this time around."I don't believe that anyone can hijack a funeral. I think that people have their own views about the individual. It is natural. People always talk. I don't think he will, what will he benefit in hijacking the memorial?” he said.Mam’s Winnie’s memorial will take place this Wednesday, 11 April at the Orlando Stadium in Soweto.
