THE SMALL community of Eersterust, near Temba, north of Tshwane was left shocked yesterday. A man believed to be Lesego’s boyfriend  handed himself over to the police. Neighbours said they heard women screaming in the early hours of Wednesday morning but didn’t go to check. The next morning, they woke up to find Lesego’s body on the fence. “It looked as if she was trying to run away but died while trying to jump over the fence,” a neighbour said. The neighbours said they went into the house to see what was going on and found the mum lying dead on the floor. The young woman’s five-year-old daughter was asleep. Temba police spokesman Constable Herman Moremi said a 34-year-old suspect handed himself in at Rietgat Police Station. “Murder cases were opened. We don’t know the cause but we’re investigating,” Moremi said. He said the two women had big stab wounds in their upper bodies. However, they didn’t find any weapon at the scene.
