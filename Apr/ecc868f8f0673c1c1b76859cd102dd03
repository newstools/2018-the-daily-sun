Small said 15 years ago he decided to give abandoned Beetles a new home. Without any formal training, he learnt how to fix the cars from his uncle. Ever since he discovered his passion, he has been fixing the classic cars at his home in Winnie Mandela section, Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. He fixes the engines and repaints the cars so they look as good as new. People can’t stop admiring the cars as they pass his workshop. Small told Daily Sun: “I fell in love with the cars years ago and decided I was going to work with them. “After I fixed my first Beetle and started driving it around, people approached me and asked me to fix theirs.“I am always on the look- out for people who don’t want their Beetles anymore because I love these cars. “I am now a full-time Beetle mechanic. I truly love what I’m doing and my wish is to see more Beetles being driven on the streets.” When he spoke to the SunTeam, he was fixing three cars.
