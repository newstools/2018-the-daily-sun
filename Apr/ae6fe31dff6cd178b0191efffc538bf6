ACCORDING to a US study, loneliness is deadlier than obesity and must be considered a health hazard. Researchers looked at 218 cases to study the health effects of social isolation and loneliness involving nearly four million people. They discovered that lonely people had a 50% increased risk of early death, compared to those with good social connections. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>In contrast, obesity raised the chance of dying before the age of 70 by a staggering 30%. Therapist Nokuzola Sithole told SunBuzz most people who were lonely or suffered from loneliness were in such a state, as they’d put their happiness in other people’s hands. Said Nokuzola: “If you had someone who you always confided in and the relationship changed suddenly, you’d feel betrayed and detach from people altogether. “You now only trust yourself, but some things are a bit too much for a person to face alone, regardless of how strong they may be.” Nokuzola said even people with strong characters got lonely and felt as though everyone was against them. Asserted Nokuzola: “Loneliness attracts depression, anxiety and paranoia, especially if one gets enough time to be damaged by these mental illnesses. “People with mental illnesses only resort to suicide. That’s why people who are lonely should be comforted and always assured that they are not alone, while obese people need support to change their lifestyle.” Psychologist Mpho Tsotetsi said the study might be accurate, especially if one paid attention to how people tended to react in such incidents. Insisted Mpho: “I can agree with the study, but loneliness and obesity revolve around emotions. “When a person is lonely, they are advised to be around people. This because they can drown in their loneliness, which will eventually make them miserable. “Remember, misery loves company. So that means negative thoughts dominate more than the positive ones.” She said such people were prone to pity parties and contemplating suicidal thoughts. Mpho said loneliness was dangerous because the person tended to become their own worst enemy, whereas an obese person found comfort in eating and sleeping. “An obese person doesn’t pay attention to feelings because food gives them the satisfaction they seek,” Mpho said. “It’s different to them because food really puts a smile on their face and fills the void.” She said a lonely person could interact with people on a daily basis, but still make time to think about how bad their situation was, eventually leading them to commit suicide. Nurse Thato Maphumulo said obesity could be combatted if a person stuck to a healthy lifestyle. Said Thato: “Obesity isn’t that deep, a person can wake up one morning and decides to change the way they live. It’s a matter of support, which they can get from those close to them. “The thing about obesity is that it causes other chronic diseases.” According to relationship expert Karabo Libate, people tended to lose themselves when they were overweight, especially in a relationship. This as they felt as though they were competing with other women. “Loneliness is a very dangerous thing as it affects everything you do,” Karabo said. “Some people are lonely even when in a relationship. “You get people who withdraw from everyone because of loneliness which, in the long run, triggers anxiety and depression. “It’s important to value you and your own company, so you don’t feel neglected and aren’t hung up on getting attention.”
