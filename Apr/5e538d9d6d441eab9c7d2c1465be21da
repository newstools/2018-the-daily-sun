EVERY time there is a cash-in-transit heist, everyone suspects it was an inside job. And now it has been discovered that this was the case with a cash van robbery earlier this month. Five workers at a cash delivery company, aged between 30 and 48, have been bust in connection with a robbery on 13 April during which R30 million was stolen. Gauteng Hawks spokeswoman Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said the arrests came after an investigation by the national bureau of illegal firearms control and priority violent crimes. A gang targeted an armoured cash vehicle travelling from a depot in Spartan, Ekurhuleni, to Selby. But the vehicle was stopped in Kensington, Joburg, by three men who took bags of money before fleeing. Mulamu said the arrested workers were expected to appear in court next week.
