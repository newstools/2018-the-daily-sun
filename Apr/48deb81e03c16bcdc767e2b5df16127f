But what we have found is sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal case being opened," Peters said.Peters said they have managed to arrest a number of suspects for drug-related crimes in Orlando in the past financial year. She highlighted that the breakthrough means they have been able to choke the supply of drugs in the area."We cannot overemphasize the even greater need to arrest and close down the actual manufacturers and suppliers," Peters added.She appealed to the neighbouring community or anyone who has information, to come forward and report to the police on any further details that could assist in concluding this case.WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
