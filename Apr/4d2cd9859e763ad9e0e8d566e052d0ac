A PAKISTANI singer who was six months pregnant was shot
dead at a wedding on Tuesday – apparently because she refused to stand up while
performing!According to Ary
News, the horrific tragedy happened at a ceremony in Kanga village near
Larkana city in the centre of the country.Samina Sindhu was sitting on stage performing at the
wedding when several men started yelling at her to stand up. Some then
approached the stage, throwing money at her. Samina eventually did stand up –
but too late, it would seem. Her initial refusal to obey the men was allegedly
behind the decision of one of the men, Tariq Jatoi, to shoot her right there on
stage.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuCZ_PoJoZHJ7IJ-2JRVYl5AX2RCKfA887tMxzUUwIxQYpQ3XHMAGNYOz8TQyzc6Li7sBlYEdnLcYU4_YZ5L0GUyMTmxo0rGS-nMSga2XDgh0dOlVeiLc40htd0TadHp2QC_S52Z-Hw45TFuYpgVzTU52CA_QP7OmMLEaDuSloJK7vJzZ3e6Uw8E2XHfC_Rcv6mvg04Vg7eLZq8B-XesI5wV8zy-gAUhEUedgSQ_i7opvNG_0UhfNst7gqemipQglo8Beov7tramPT4UoOxwm4zHyx4XJItA2S0R44\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPHrRboEp87qEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
