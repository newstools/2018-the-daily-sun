But the biggest disappointment will be the missing voice of sports anchor Robert Marawa, who is said to have declined Radio 2000’s offer. After much fanfare that Marawa is making a comeback to Radio 2000, Sunday Sun sources say he is no longer going to the station. “Robert refused to sign his Radio 2000 contract. He wants to report to the station and not to SABC Sport. “But all sport on radio has been integrated into SABC Sport, same goes for News. He wants to be the exception to the rule that applies to over a 1 000 employees contracted to the SABC.  All the others are waiting to see if they buckle to him and will also make their demands,” said the source. The source says there are divisions at the station and some of Roberts colleagues are gatvol of his higher-than-thou attitude. “Everyone feels Robert is a bully and his long friendship with new COO, who hired him back without consulting Radio 2000 and SABC Sport, has made him more arrogant,” said one source. The source says Roberts’s friendship with the COO doesn’t help the situation. “Everyone believes this is Chris Maroleng’s first blunder as COO,putting friendship above all else.Robert might be adored by fans, but none of his colleagues enjoy working with him,” said the mole. Another source claimed he also demanded the station gave him more air time and more money. “He’s demanding the show be stretched to two hours,” said the source. In the new Metro FM line-up released on Friday, Adil More is also leaving, while Thomas Mlambo takes on the Sports show from 6pm-7.30pm. When called for comment, Robert said: “If that’s what the SABC is saying, there’s nothing I can say.They know what they did to me.”  SABC spokesperson, Kaizer Kganyago, said he won’t comment on Radio 2000’s line-up because it was not yet confirmed by yesterday.
