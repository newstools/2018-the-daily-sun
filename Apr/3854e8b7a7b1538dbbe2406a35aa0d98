First of all, when I got there, a young man named Njabulo swore at me because I banged the door by mistake,” the allegation begins.Amanda says she walked onto set carrying a lot of clothing for the shoot and when she banged the door by mistake, this Njabulo person shouted at her like she was a small child and swore at her.“It doesn’t end there. When the shoot began they called me in to be an extra for the scene, the men there (part of the crew I think) kept pointing at my legs and laughing. I felt so uncomfortable, as if there was something wrong with me,” she said.The young actress says when she inquired about reporting the matter, she was told that nobody would care.“Even Duma Ndlovu won’t help you because that’s how extras are treated,” she said.Famed television director Duma Ndlovu is at the helm of the show.The only statement on record from Duma is a social media response to Amanda, asking her to send him an email.“You people treat extras like nobodies! I will make sure I gather up a team of extras and boycott Imbewu. The way extras get treated there is disgusting, those male crew are perverts as well,” Amanda continued.Amanda first made these allegations in March of this year and the matter has been ignored until now when the public and media catch on to it.Meanwhile, the allegations have sparked a social media debate.Entertainment commentator, Phil Mphela has made it his missions to get to the bottom of the issue.In a statement to Phil, e.tv has said: “e.tv is aware of the allegations made by Amanda Phakathi regarding the production of Imbewu: The Seed. The channel does not condone any behaviour of this nature and are investigating further.”Numerous female extras have allegedly made contact with Phil regarding the treatment of extras on set.“I'm getting stories of alleged ill-treatment and unwanted sexual advances made towards female extras on the set of one of the new telenovelas. Unfortunately the extras want to remain anonymous which makes it very hard to corroborate their story or report on it,” he said.Actor and popular TV producer, Lumko Johnson also weighed in on the matter.“It’s really common. Crew and cast take their chances with extras. Worked on a set where an actor had sex with an extra on one of the studio beds - it was an open secret no one addressed,” he said.
