The first round loss was an accident and we need to rectify it on Saturday.“All PSL games at this stage are tough and we are expecting a tough derby, as Celtic also have a goal to achieve. But everything has been going well at training and the confidence is high among the boys.”Stars come into this crucial encounter without a win in any of their last three league matches. Although they have been in good form this season, the last time the Belgian coach’s charges tasted league victory was a 2-1 win against bottom side Platinum Stars at Royal Bafokeng Stadium on 3 March.Celtic have been blowing hot and cold. In their last four league games, they won only once, drawing once and losing twice.Their last league win was a 1-0 victory over Dikwena in March, with striker Ndumiso Mabena scoring the only goal.Celtic head coach Veselin Jelusic will be hoping his charges display the same form they did in the first derby and get maximum points, which will boost their chance of ending the season in the top eight. Celtic and Stars are ninth and fifth respectively in the standings.Stars have 38 points, five more than Celtic, both having played the same number of league matches – 26. Eymael said victory against Celtic would be a huge boost for his team ahead of their Nedbank Cup semifinal match against Kaizer Chiefs at Moses Mabhida Stadium next Saturday (8.15pm).“It will be nice to win the derby going into the Nedbank Cup game with Chiefs,” he said. “It would be a huge confidence boost for the boys. But first we are focused on winning the derby.”
