Musician J’ Something, real name Joao da Fonseca, may be a star who has everything going for him today but his life has not always been this smooth.Back in the day when he used to "manage, clean and prepare a music studio" for other big local artists, he had no idea he would one day be a big star himself.Although he was just "honoured to be in the presence of these stars," no doubt he had bigger dreams for his life.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvuGTB5ldS326fS5NYF9BnHzeInV_ebiGgXcWc7NTfSq1fdDPGMQ2ApYPkdZAmAicpw7DSXKAi0rLRBaH4W-ownxYgfcoVp1N768aMlsj7zT5kEpibnqVxqhjQv96buW5wgD6AdYN2kOxouToZjrXyqjeN8FKDmehl5VvEwLuTDgEDCnbE9gvc3-eQ3VxD037LIM964UQB40k1hvOKVkCz8svdGapPH24dIWmZuaT5hwWWnVssFFtSWDDvr70cVdgJKyNM5FtFrwQOchBISsKLRbM5NC61mv0bssAQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBqEzg1HvDV9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

At the time I was doing gospel acoustic music that really wasn’t any good ... he listened and tried to help but it really wasn’t his forté and if I am brutally honest I just wasn’t good enough at the time,” he wrote.After getting his Bcom, the singer again linked up with his cousin in Joburg who helped him find his feet.“I guarantee you that the ambition of trying to get me a job had nothing to do with music.“I ended up managing a studio and cleaning the studio rooms and setting them up for the big stars that walked through the doors (people like Hugh Masekela, Joyous, Brian Temba,Jamali, Sipho Hotstix, etc),” he added.J’ Something ended the post by showing gratitude to his cousin who judging from the story, played a massive role in his career.Let me share a story with you. 8 years ago I was introduced to a cousin of mine (the short handsome fella standing next to me in this picture) ... he was in the music business so my family obviously reached out to him and guilt tripped him into at least listening to my music. At the time I was doing gospel acoustic music that really wasn’t any good ... he listened and tried to help but it really wasn’t his forté and if I am brutally honest I just wasn’t good enough at the time. Time went by, I finished my BComm degree in Business Science and once I finished the degree he invited me to Joburg to try and “make a plan” ... I guarantee you that the ambition of trying to get me a job had nothing to do with music. I ended up managing a studio and cleaning the studio rooms and setting them up for the big stars that walked through the doors (people like Hugh Masekela, Joyous, Brian Temba, Jamali, Sipho Hotstix, etc) ... I did that job with such passion and commitment, honored to be in the presence of all these stars! Fast forward cuz @stooooooge look at us man ... backstage of the biggest Jazz festival in the continent headlining and filling up the biggest stage! Thank you for opening the door for me ... thank you for offering me your couch for so long and helping me buy my first car (A pimping Tazz) and so much more!
