allowing them to speak and suspending council rules. They accused the speaker of collapsing the council.But Trollip said opposition parties are the ones that
collapsed the meeting, adding that their behaviour was "disrespectful".He said they have always been ready for the debate but
will not allow to be held to ransom by people who lack courage of their convictions.Trollip said opposition parties will have to find another
61 signatures and petition the speaker for another motion of no confidence.But the opposing parties held their own meeting in the
chamber and vowed that the next time council sits, it will have to discuss
their motion because the council was collapsed by the speaker and not
them.
