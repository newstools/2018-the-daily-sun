Bonang Matheba is on a mission of world domination and just won’t stop. The local media darling has barely been in the country in 2018 and is showing no signs of slowing down. Next week Queen B will jet off to London in the UK to emcee the Global Gift Foundation’s Nelson Mandela Centenary Gala Dinner. This comes a day after Zahara announced that she would also be in London this year for a performance at a Nelson Mandela concert. Bonang will host the gala dinner on the 24th of April in the presence of Vanessa Williams and Maria Bravo who are the chairwomen of the foundation. Beverley Knight and Pamela Anderson will also be in attendance. The Global Gift Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims to create a positive impact in the lives of children, women and families in need. ....in 2018, we celebrate an ICON! @globalgiftfoundation Centenary Gala Dinner...In aid of the Nelson Mandela Foundation....
