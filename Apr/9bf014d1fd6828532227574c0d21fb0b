RESIDENTS are often knocked down by trains while crossing the railway line near Shaka’s Head in KwaDukuza – but three incidents that occurred last week made residents very angry.Three unknown men, two of whom died, were hit by trains close to Compensation Station in separate incidents on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday.The residents want Prasa to move the train station closer to the Imbonini Park industrial area, where many locals work.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstO9015WT2_JAgOfGoUo3hbSmkPLcFIuY3BFKxb__uM0zOykXWbBWiTWhP_7zgKNcjPWwdnKTW_rBC4Ursdbjw1RxHL0XveCTJuuFC4rmP-YtO4i0nLm1OolXiDN-_is7526150Wu9TzX_06kZ3iNKPw-Y_Z346M2z2CDe7PuoDlAS__xf2Gs30FDFAQkQakdZm_E4XGws2P0mU8ElYh5-j22gD2HLUKg_IbtUbFGTkgOmfEziha8KPah715BT-rLhH5LrgUEZAi8_qlSayVYgky8GfhGQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDRbup9_pZ-4EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Workers have to cross the railway line and walk alongside the tracks for about 30 minutes,” she said.Councillor Mlamuli Ndlela told Daily Sun the only way people’s lives could be saved was if Prasa moved the station closer to Imbonini Park.“A few months ago we spoke to Prasa officials, but they have not yet responded. We are going to pursue the matter,” he said.IPSS Medical Rescue Services spokesman Paul Herbst said two of the victims who were knocked down on Tuesday and Friday died at the scene.“The third victim lost an arm on Saturday,” he said.Police spokesman Lieutenant- Colonel Thulani Zwane said two inquest dockets were opened.Prasa spokeswoman Isabel van der Westhuizen said Prasa was conducting a study to find safer sites for new stations.
