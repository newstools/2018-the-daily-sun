of an independent news website for operating without a license, the latest
episode in a crackdown on independent media.They say Adel Sabri was arrested late on Tuesday and taken
to a Cairo police station, while the offices of the Masr al-Arabia website were
shuttered. Prosecutors are questioning him on Wednesday.The arrest came a day after President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi
won a second, four-year term in office, with 97% of the vote in last week's
election.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvvUXMavHJKqP68cIqH01mFMieBI1HFBl8Wn_3Yqa8U_FWocgWyFPT4BR2FTUxwFBa2afx5GVtuoMWQTdBKROOMTHXF0NIaqvhDI3PjfZC8MqJb4JDlNmsbtrHSwln2HgWJZF9FK5kw3gMf5JuZMmTd2wTPOWhZLMv1mOOUEGtcsNFHAPdfvdjTHRBPcEuTZRsMyjplnaM6TuxSyDiOkaOu1Ydpht_R1uFLYj2NR6TwxyW-reBtjzs2nr_JvETRLZI5pkVhp_jB5VwU0fC1vzoPR8rZ0BDneoSHlTE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBQ37PXolAb-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
