of an independent news website for operating without a license, the latest
episode in a crackdown on independent media.They say Adel Sabri was arrested late on Tuesday and taken
to a Cairo police station, while the offices of the Masr al-Arabia website were
shuttered. Prosecutors are questioning him on Wednesday.The arrest came a day after President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi
won a second, four-year term in office, with 97% of the vote in last week's
election.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst1cVrhDIO8mau5es4uIXmqpOurdCPMplsN6OppNDF0UULyxkEAT3UHERvMXFxbqXf9uIZy2B7_W0njIzjlzBW4r-3ZenAAL0F-vmao-Yv8kpz_FYWIKPtVWTDyp2dvOmshajr8HAm0_Xjcq2FSMLl1v0Fu2idtOAuFBSMZ8jG0wjWg7SUoYXTgQPgs2RZ1EDd1loRagTzT5tAz3nnkhdBHAWyjjWjRU4497vJKx-05os5l2fPnUVPXvqy8KI_a9hrDKfL9eHefYUUv6-y65LDx-v-6FumxxOtcFw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNIMaTseNJu3EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
