A POLICE couple escaped death after their house was petrol bombed. The incident happened in Ekangala in Bronkhorstspruit, Tshwane, in the early hours of Friday morning. Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange condemned the attack. “At the time of the incident, the husband and wife were asleep in the house,” she said. “They were awoken by what was later confirmed to be a petrol bomb thrown through the window.” “There was a shoot-out between the male cop and suspects. Shots were allegedly fired by suspects and the husband returned fire, forcing the suspects to flee.” The wife sustained burn wounds and was rushed to hospital. De Lange said the motive behind the attack was yet to be established. She appealed to residents to come forward and help cops arrest the suspects. “Harbouring a suspect is a criminal offence,” said De Lange.
