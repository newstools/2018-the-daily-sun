THESE young people risk their lives to protect animals. The environmental monitors patrol Mkuze Game Reserve in Mkuze, northern KZN every day. Their job is to protect animals from poachers. Officials from the department of environmental affairs joined them as they patrolled on Tuesday. The monitors joined the department’s Champion programme in 2015 and were placed at the reserve. Most of them want to further their studies, while others use their stipend to take care of their loved ones. Smanga Manzini (25), one of the monitors, graduated with a diploma in nature conservation from the University of South Africa last week. “My brother was paying for my fees. But when I got involved with this programme three years ago, I used the money they gave me to pay my fees,” she said. Isimangaliso Wetland Park spokeswoman Mandisa Nkosi said the programme hired 112 environmental monitors this year. “This programme changes young people’s lives. We’re proud that most of them have decided to use the money they made to study,” she said. The environmental programme director said the department hired 744 monitors in KwaZulu-Natal. He said they’re planning to increase the number of monitors in the next financial year.
