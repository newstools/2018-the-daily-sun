Venda Poet Lutendo “Vendaboy Poet” Mugagadeli saw his biggest dream come true when he recited a poem for President Cyril Ramaphosa. The 28-year-old from Mthadalala in Limpopo surprised the President yesterday (23 April) on a British Airways flight from Durban to Johannesburg. A video of Lutendo, who has never been on a plane before, reciting the poem has already gone viral. Lutendo told Daily Sun that he had a dream of the poem in May last year, before Ramaphosa became Mzansi’s president. So it came as a pleasant surprise when British Airways called him last week Friday and asked him to help them surprise the president. “Mr Mugagadeli recently said in an interview that he’d be honoured to meet the President and act as his official praise poet,” said Bridgette Ramuluvhana, Marketing Manager for British Airways (operated by Comair). “We were delighted to make that happen and to ensure Mr Ramaphosa had a presidential welcome aboard.”
