MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane is in a hurry to wrap up the 2017-18 Absa Premiership season in order to focus on the African Champions League and the Nedbank Cup.The ambitious coach is racing against time to open up an unassailable lead on closest rivals Orlando Pirates to make it mathematically impossible for Downs to lose out on the title. He is hoping to extend their title record to eight and get another place in the 2019 Caf Champions League as PSL champions. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>And the high-riding Brazilians showed their intent to get to the other side of a season that has been a roller-coaster ride for everyone involved, by beating the 2016-17 PSL champions Bidvest Wits 2-0 on Saturday.Sundowns, who will host Golden Arrows at Loftus Versfeld in Tshwane in a catch-up game tomorrow (7.30pm), have relied heavily on the consistency of players such as potential PSL Footballer of the Year, Player of the Season and Players’ Player of the Season, Percy Tau.And then there are Themba Zwane and Sibusiso Vilakazi who scored against Wits – all thanks to the supply from the evergreen Tau. Tau is joint top scorer in the league with Polokwane City’s Rodney Ramagalela on 11 goals.Tau was widely praised by the jubilant Mosimane for his work rate: “This was a big win for us. I didn’t want to hype it up before the match because I didn’t want the opponents to over-prepare for us. The win gives us the opportunity to play the Champions League for the fourth season in a row, and this has given us confidence. “We want to wrap up the title quickly to turn our attention to the Champions League.”He said they wanted “no favours” en route to their last match of the season against Bloemfontein Celtic on 12 May “because we can do it ourselves”.Added Mosimane: “I’m happy that we had different scorers against Wits. We have never had a top scorer in the league in my time here, now Tau is up there and that’s growth. Tau is not just scoring, he also provides for others. I’m happy for him.” Downs will hit the 55-point mark if they complete the job against Arrows, and very few would bet against that happening.
