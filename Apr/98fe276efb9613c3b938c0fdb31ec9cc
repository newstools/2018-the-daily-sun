commuters have been urged to continue using alternative transport as the national bus strike enters its third week. Zanele Sabela, a spokeswoman for the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union, said the strike will continue today. There has been no agreement between workers and ministers. She said Transport Minister Blade Nzimande and his labour counterpart Mildred Oliphant’s efforts to end the deadlock had failed. “The employers have given us an ultimatum that, if we don’t take their offer by Wednesday, they will revert to their first offer,” Sabela told Daily Sun. She said employers are offering 9% for the first year over 11 months, and 8% on the second year. But workers want 9,5% for the first year over 12 months, and 8,5% for the second year. Commuters have been forced to use taxis, adding to the already crowded taxi queues. The hardest hit are said to be those with monthly bus tags. Noludwe Bodlo (45) from Motherwell in Nelson Mandela Bay said: “We call on all parties involved, including government, to find a solution urgently. We can’t take it anymore.” Zodumo Mdingi (49), a trader from Mount Frere, said: “The strike not only affects commuters but businesses as well. “My fruits are normally sold out by the end of the day, but I’m still sitting with last week’s stock.” Ntombikayise Soldat (49) said this was giving her a headache because she hasn’t made enough money to support her kids. Buhle Masangwana (43) said her stock is not selling.
