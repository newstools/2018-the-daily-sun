IT WAS described as a service delivery protest, but police said the people who attacked and stole from the Metro cops’ offices were just thugs. The cops are now hunting suspects who also petrol- bombed a police Casspir and damaged computer equipment at Ekurhuleni Metro Police offices. Ivory Park police spokesman Captain Bernard Matimulane said the incident happened on Wednesday night in Tembisa’s Tswelopele section, Ekurhuleni. He said police were following all possible leads. “We believe that failure to deal decisively with these perpetrators will lead to anarchy,” he said. “It’s not immediately clear which political formation is responsible for the violence.” He said service delivery issues were being mentioned occasionally, but the fact that the perpetrators waited for darkness before embarking on damaging property told a story. “These are tsotsis,” said Matimulane. He said apart from the damage to the offices, perpetrators blocked roads, damaged robots and foreign-owned shops were looted. Ekurhuleni Metro Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said two computers were stolen and two printers were broken when they were dropped. He said the police have so far arrested five people in connection with the violence and looting of shops.
