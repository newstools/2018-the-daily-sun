THE bigger the challenge, the brighter the solution! The national water crisis has been highlighted in a very real way in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Limpopo and they continue to have a reduced supply. Mzansi’s changing rainfall patterns have had a serious impact on the crisis. The country’s citizens and businesses have come together to create a nation that sees saving water as a way of life. Unilever is championing water conservation across the country. Assistant brand manager Lerato Dumisa said last year’s Sunlight Saves Water campaign was a success. According to Dumisa, 70 000 litres of water were saved. “But we need to do more,” she said. “This year, through partnerships with Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa, Jojo Tanks, Save Our Schools, and the department of water and sanitation, 35 5 000l tanks and over 1,5 million litres of water are being donated to schools in the Western Cape. “Sunlight 2in1 is committed to making lives brighter by taking its efforts further. “South Africans expect us to give them more than a great fragrance.” The brand teamed up with Big Mama’s Famous Truth Shop to create the first edition of a story that helps people understand major issues such as the water crisis. In the Sunlight insert in today’s paper, you will find a colourful story called @Big Mama’s. Big Mama’s visited Western Cape Daily Sun readers to learn how they felt about the water crisis and what they were doing to solve it. “I would like to call on everyone to join Sunlight and pledge to save water. “Speak up and offer solutions,” said Dumisa.
