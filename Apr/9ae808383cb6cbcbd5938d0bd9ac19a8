HIGHER Education and Training Minister Naledi Pandor has assured Mzansi that the new bursary scheme has been executed successfully. In 2017 government announced that free education would be
implemented to support poor students whose parentsâ€™ combined annual income is
R350 000 or less. According to Pandor, R7.166 billion has been allocated in
2018 to fund bursaries for children of poor and working class families entering
universities and TVET colleges. "R4.581 billion set aside for qualifying university
students and R2.585 billion allocated for TVET college students," Pandor. She said first time
entering students will not be expected to pay back the cost of their bursaries. However, she mentioned that they will be expected to meet
certain conditions and expectations, including satisfactory academic
performance and service conditions. "The exact details are being finalised. I am pleased to
announce that good progress has been made since the announcement to ensure that
the new bursary scheme is implemented successfully," she said. Pandor said TVET colleges students in all years of study
will receive a bursary to cover their tuition fee and learning materials. Over 458 875 students
will receive tuition bursaries in the 2018/2019 financial year based on
historical data and the enrolment targets. She further mentioned that all existing National Student
Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) funded university students will receive their
funding in 2018 and for the completion of their studies as grants rather than
as loans. The Minister said she has instructed all universities to
keep within their enrolment targets, which determines how many students and in
which fields of study can be admitted to each university.
