local clinic for treatment before being discharged soon thereafter, regional
manager Richard Walker said in a statement.He condemned the incident, describing assaults on employees
as "brutal, criminal and unwarranted"."Our employees are instrumental in delivering an
essential public service to the thousands of commuters who depend on trains as
their primary means of transport," he said."The attack is totally unacceptable and Metrorail
protection services will liaise with provincial SAPS (including the rapid rail
response unit) to develop mitigating crime prevention strategies."Walker appealed to any witnesses or anyone with information
to report it to the authorities, adding that rewards of up to R25 000 were
payable for tips leading to successful convictions.SOURCE: NEWS24
