RESIDENTS of Madiba Park near Polokwane fear for their lives.  That’s because in the bush near their homes some residents dump rubbish. This attracts mice and dangerous snakes.Dikeledi Sekgala (47) said she heard men banging her gate on Sunday, calling for her to open it.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvHJP6UjcwzW4tbqfHrpObdPcpR9TAYh2CP5u4fUewT23QNzXmdewI4GsJG6OCLBLUzJtFokuoYkMP9f9pZbl7khe1Re_tr7z5pCMyhq6NqRToq8iFDtKOsI57qhYS2x4C0vY102_OF_PF0TxxFFBXEgMqWB7YYHuyHtmVMyGkie7_TLGlRYvl-JQDvyIZyLat8ALfZ_7ADYQOVc_S6qfjlbbsOELfcIM0qR5RQ3ssJy-Q_q-hJ_nNtTkfnqZA5O1L7jjDgYr1bqoBcpcKh4d0flUU065nD\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIG764nLkm7KEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I’m still traumatised. I’ve called the SPCA several times but nothing has happened,” she said.Dikeledi said the last time the bush was cleared was in 2016. “Every time we ask the municipality to help, we are told nothing can be done as the ‘No dumping sign’ has been stolen.” Khutso Mokwena (27) said there were many dangerous snakes in the bush.“Another huge snake was killed at a nearby house a day after Good Friday. Some people have also seen a huge python.Polokwane municipal spokesman Matshidiso Mothapo said: “The municipality can clear the rubbish and put up a no dumping sign, but it is the residents themselves who must stop illegal dumping. It is a serious offence.”
