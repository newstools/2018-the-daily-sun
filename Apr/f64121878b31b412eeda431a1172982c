 OWNER of
media group ANN7 Mzwanele Manyi announced a re-branding of ANN7 to Afro
Worldview on Monday. Manyi said
this is a strategic decision to break away from the past of the previous
channel ANN7 and give viewers a fresh outlook on the news. According to
Manyi, as part of the group strategy, The New Age newspaper will be rebranded
as Afro Voice and its editorial policy will be in line with the press code. "Afro
Worldview will go live on 30 April 2018, as a rebrand of the ANN7 channel, on
DStv channel 405. "It will
still be a 24-hour news platform covering news, business and current affairs.
The channel will adopt a completely new look and feel with a renewed editorial
policy in line with the BCCSA code," Manyi said. The channel
will stop broadcasting on DStv on 20 August 2018 as the contract to broadcast
ANN7 on DStv will not be renewed. However, Afro
Worldview will be participating in the bidding process of the proposed new
black-owned news channel on MultiChoiceâ€™s DStv platform. Meanwhile,
the Sunday Times reported on Sunday that Manyi claims to have paid the Gupta
family in full for ANN7 and The New Age newspaper. The Sunday
Times reported that Manyi said in a statement released on Saturday, that the
original amount owed has been lowered after renegotiation's. He said he
made a full settlement of what he still owed the Guptas. Manyi said he
released the statement to save hundreds of jobs by putting to rest "any
suspicions of lingering involvement" by the Gupta family in the media
company.
