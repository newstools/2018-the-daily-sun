Ajax Cape Town captain Mosa Lebusa says they are not yet thinking about the play-offs despite remaining in second from bottom with just one match remaining. On Saturday, Ajax gave away an early lead to lose 3-1 to Mamelodi Sundowns in the Premiership, which left the Urban Warriors faced with the prospect of playing for survival in the play-offs. They will host Kaizer Chiefs in their last match, but their fate is not in their hands going into the last matches of the season with SuperSport United and Polokwane City also playing to avoid the relegation play-offs. The Ajax skipper told SuperSport: "We were trying to get out of the situation that we are in. "We scored an early goal, but after that we sat back and allowed them to play their normal game. "Thatâ€™s where they are strong and so powerful. They just kept coming and got the goals. We could not comeback. "But there is always pressure in football. We have to go again and give it our all. "We are hopeful that we do not get there. We will take the play-offs, but we are not thinking about the play-offs." SPORT24
