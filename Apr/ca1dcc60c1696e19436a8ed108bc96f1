BURYING her granddaughter’s remains on Saturday won’t be enough to give gogo Marry Mokoena’s family closure. “I find some comfort knowing I can bury her remains, but I still want to see who did this,” said Marry, whose granddaughter Lebo Mokoena (22) was found buried in a shallow grave in February at Nkohlakalo, in KaBokweni, Mpumalanga. She had gone missing in September. Gogo said Lebo’s murder has caused her too much pain. “Those who killed her are slowly killing me.” She said she will miss the love Lebo shared with the whole family. “She used to cook and clean for me before she went anywhere. “I was surprised that on the day she went missing, she didn’t let me know where she was.” “People said I should stop looking for her. “They said I must not stress myself because she was involved in prostitution in town but that didn’t seem likely.” Daily Sun published an article in February 2016 about residents protesting against the police, accusing them of not doing enough to investigate Lebo’s murder. KaBokweni Police Station spokeswoman Captain Shirley Nsimba thanked the residents and the family for working with them. “ It is not good to learn your family member died like that,” she said. “The investigation is continuing and we urge residents to come forward if they have any information,” she said.
