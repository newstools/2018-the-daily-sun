ACTRESS and TV presenter Tshenolo “Nolo” Seabi is starting to make a name for herself in showbiz. Well-known for her work in SABC1 lifestyle show Selimathunzi and Mzansi Magic telenovela Isithembiso, this star has her eyes set on becoming a household name. Born and bred in Boksburg, east of Jozi, Nolo is more than just a pretty face. She holds a bachelor of arts degree from The South African School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance. Speaking to SunBuzz about her journey, Nolo said: “I didn’t know that I wanted to be in the industry. “I wanted to be an air hostess at first. Then that changed to being a doctor. Then I wanted to work with dead bodies, performing autopsies, but that freaked me out. “So, then I wanted to get into forensics but again I changed my mind.” Eventually, while doing Grade 8, Nolo decided to do a TV presenting course and was hooked. “That’s when I knew I had to be in front of the camera. “It’s really good for the soul, it feeds my soul and drives me more than anything,” she said. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstt8t_OAqFbL5-kj2ZcMbiYtg3horr-AwBEia2b6oP0skf1q5_7VvKo16AvR5hM0WA-sOhFdk0Iv3ZU9-NE7EZuRtMXjR2W3Z7e98wc54yXERnfIsY1VrFSYi06haEWBnLcHHQLjNawy-4LTBtoNH7FNBTsnfy5_3U3qk6fXSmeQ8f3natsRdNFCFmDqsevcKvxJ-zn6f0eRyYANG_qQoJZLhoJDO1RAWANY6y9vba6-jBwmx5vrJUlEvG3gvTnD58_f9qLifR5RQuafx1pce1ImPQEVF8bTDmL5g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIxEfpPW9lOzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It’s about how you deliver.”About her role in Isithembiso, Nolo said: “The best part is working with the likes of Hamilton Dlamini, Chichi Letswalo and making friends with them outside of work.”Watch as she shares the top five things we didn't we didn't know about her:
