Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa in the Gauteng Legislature.Bloom said : “The cash-strapped Gauteng Health Department
has paid R103 million to Ngcebetsha Madlanga Attorneys for work that included
an opinion on terminating the Life Esidimeni contract, and opposing the two
court applications that tried to stop the transfer of mental health patients to
unsuitable NGOs.”According to Bloom, Ramokgopa said the firm was paid from
October 2014 to September 2017 and the firm was first appointed by
participating in a contract for a panel of legal service providers.The firm and the department entered into a ten months
contract from January 2016, until the same year in October.“Then an addendum was signed that extended the contract
to October 2017,” said Bloom.Bloom described this to be suspicious.He said: “This looks quite fishy, but Ramokgopa claims
that there were no irregularities identified in connection with this law firm.“The amount paid to this firm is grossly excessive, and
it is disturbing that much of this was for bad advice that contributed to the
Esidimeni tragedy,” added Bloom.During the arbitration hearing into the tragedy of 144
Life Esidimeni mentally-ill patients, the former deputy chief justice Dikgang
Moseneke found that the leaders of the Marathon project, including former
Health MEC Quedani Mahlangu, acted irrationally and failed to uphold the
Constitution. He ordered the state to pay R1,2 million to the families
within three months.
