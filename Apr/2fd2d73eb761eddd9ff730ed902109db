FORMER US
president Barack Obama will deliver the 16th Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture in
Johannesburg in July. The Nelson
Mandela Foundation and the Obama Foundation said for most of his life, Nelson
Mandela fought for democracy and equality. In a joint statement
the foundations said Mandela's presidency was defined by his efforts to
solidify the fragile democracy of South Africa and by his lessons on the
politics of 'bridge-building' over the politics of division. The lecture will
take place on July 17, a day before Nelson Mandela International Day at the
Ellis Park Arena in Johannesburg. According the
foundations, about 4 000 people are expected to attend. The lecture's theme
will be "Renewing the Mandela Legacy and Promoting Active Citizenship in a
Changing World". "The Nelson
Mandela Annual Lecture will focus on creating conditions for bridging divides,
working across ideological lines, and resisting oppression and
inequality," the joint statement said.
