Residents have called on the municipality to come to their aid. Sindiswa said: “Something needs to be done about this because kids use the same path to walk to school.”Gogo Rose Zwane (70), who lives in a corner house, said she feared opening the windows since her husband found a snake while he was mowing the lawn recently.“While he was busy outside, a snake about one metre long emerged. We killed it,” said Rose.Councillor Mkhuseli Jokazi said:“I have told the municipality on several occasions that we need them to maintain our parks and open spaces because it makes it easy for snakes to hide. “I’m with the community on this and I especially fear for our kids. I will get to the bottom of it.” Themba Goba, Westonaria municipal manager, said: “There are some parts in the area that don’t belong to the municipality that are classified as private land. “We can’t be held accountable for that space. “But we will make sure the areas belonging to the municipality are well maintained.”
