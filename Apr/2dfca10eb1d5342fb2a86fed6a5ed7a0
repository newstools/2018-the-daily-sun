MINERAL Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe yesterday visited the Limpopo mine where six miners died in a fire on Monday. They died when a bus transporting about 50 of them to Modikwa platinum mine was petrol-bombed in Driekop Village, outside Burgersfort. Speaking to company management, chiefs and residents, Mantashe said the suspects must have intended to burn all the people in the bus to death. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss1HLuc3vQJDvw8gR7TplF_uMftLDo4Xtgq6fhYtoOuvXULpipjnHMX__iucrXuz7zBcUVoj24XLXIort4oQ7_HEXIoXAVlxuywCsyoOG5ZqhEDSg6WYlVF1pQ61y0upYnY-Ezffo6Rs9lSaL38QoX5Q2LbMZC47BPeacisC9JTBKAU4n9hz8BrUnsd6ouynWEPE929UKGOp4YegDSvHCJ5oWh_mT-mN_xiUTQ6JlmjDNSxVrPW_TeUC3h_fr2GPy1c7Ib31NfdLY_Jpf3aHU8cvAGk3Xs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKiKBkr01BFwEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Pastors should pray more,” he said.  “If one person can burn 50 people, it shows that evil is overtaking good. “We know about the five suspects, but we need to find the mastermind.” Patrice Motsepe, chairman of African Rainbow Minerals, was also at the mine. He said: “Don’t turn your backs on each other. We’re children of the same soil.  “Who can we trust if we’re going to fight each other?” One of the suspects, a 29-year-old man, appeared in court yesterday.  He was kept in custody until next Thursday.  Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the other four suspects will appear in the Praktiseer Magistrates Court today.
