ANN7 and
The New Age are now officially 100% black-owned! Afrotone
Media Holdings (AMH) released a statement over the weekend. The
formerly Gupta-owned ANN7 and The New Age was recently bought by former
journalist and businessman Mzwanele Manyi. Manyi
bought the Gupta-owned media companies for R450 million last August through
vendor financing. “Afrotone
Media Holdings (AMH) is proud to announce its settlement of the ANN7 and The
New Age acquisitions. “The paid
up position comes after very tough negotiations between Oakbay and Manyi's
consortium which led to the varying of the initial vendor finance deal. “Owing to
the current operating environment, Oakbay agreed to fully relinquish its hold
on the companies' pledged shares leading to a newly negotiated settlement
deal,” the statement read. The
statement also goes on to say that Afrotone Media Holdings' ownership of
Infinity Media Networks (Pty) Ltd (ANN7) and TNA Media (Pty) Ltd (The New Age)
“is now debt free and unencumbered.” “As a truly
South African 100% Black owned and managed company, this development
strengthens AMH's position to realise the benefits of this strategic
acquisition. “This
development should finally put to rest any suspicions of lingering involvement
of the Guptas and importantly should provide the much needed market confidence
to avert potential job loss of over 500, mainly black and young employees,” the
statement also said.
