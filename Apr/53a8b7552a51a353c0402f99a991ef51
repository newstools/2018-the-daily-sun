Our favourite queen of the dancefloor is taking her smash-hit dance moves all the way to the USA. Zodwa Wabantu will cross the Atlantic Ocean tomorrow and head over to Washington DC to shake what her mama gave her. Zodwa is so excited she called herself a star. “God is showing off only nge Voshooo Dance,” she said. This is after she performed in London twice in 2017 and she says there are more destinations on the way. “I have consulted with God already done deals. Not forgetting the Brains behind Zodwa Wabantu, Afrotainment. The boss, DJ Tira,” she continued.
