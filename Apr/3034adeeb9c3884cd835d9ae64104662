We took him to a doctor after we realised something was wrong.” She said when Mishack disappeared, they were still waiting for the doctor’s results. “My employers have allowed me to take leave because I can’t perform my duties well. “I’m worried about my husband. His two kids need him. SunReaders, please help us find him.” Eersterust police spokeswoman Constable Connie Moganedi said: “Cops are investigating a case of a missing person.”Anyone with information about Mishack’s whereabouts should call their nearest police station, or Daily Sun’s Tshwane offices on 012 485 9000.
