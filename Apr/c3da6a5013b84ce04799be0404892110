THE effects of spectator violence will be felt when Orlando Pirates play Bidvest Wits behind closed doors at Orlando Stadium tonight (7.30pm). The match comes hot on the heels of the Moses Mabhida Stadium mayhem, where several hotheads invaded the pitch after Kaizer Chiefs lost the Nedbank Cup semifinal to Free State Stars on Saturday. The chaos mirrors the appalling scenes at Loftus Versfeld early last year when Bucs got thrashed by Mamelodi Sundowns. As punishment, the league ordered Pirates to play two matches behind closed doors. They face Wits in the first of those fixtures, looking to keep the Absa Premiership battle alive. It’s unclear whether this punishment will serve as a deterrent to unruly fans, however. What is clear is that there will be no one to cheer on Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic’s charges against the stuttering and relegation-threatened Clever Boys tonight. Second with 49 points in the table, the Soweto giants need to win to stay in the two-horse race with leaders Sundowns, with three matches left. For Wits coach Gavin Hunt, the match is far more important as he looks to avoid a relegation dogfight. Despite occupying 10th spot, Wits are not out of danger as they are only five points clear of relegation. “Every game is important for us,” said Hunt. “A top eight finish? I don’t know. I’m sure we can make it. We have nine points to play for. If you want it, you can achieve it. It’s about how much you want it. We’ll see tomorrow. It’s always not easy against Pirates. “We drew with Baroka and Polokwane City and that hasn’t helped our cause. And we haven’t been scoring.” Hunt threw his weight behind those condemning crowd violence, saying people should be more disciplined. “It’s unacceptable. It goes back to my playing days in the 80s. The guy who kicked the poor security person in the face is not a man. He is lower than the scum of the earth!.”
