COMMUNITY members of Mahikeng in the North West have found a new plan to address the issue of potholes in their area! They have started planting trees in the huge potholes in their kasi. The people said they were tired of protests and sending complaints to the municipality about damaged roads. Although the trees are in the middle of the road, the residents said knocking them down would be considered a serious offence. Resident Hlalefo Mahome (22) said: “Instead of protesting we thought we could do things differently to address this matter. We planted the trees to raise our concerns about the bad roads. All we want are better roads.” Residents of Rustenburg also joined in on the drive and are doing the same in their kasi. Peter Moeng said this was the most peaceful protest ever. “People could not have done it better around here. They are doing nothing wrong but addressing the issue of potholes. I applaud them. We don’t need to fight in order to be heard,” said Peter. The planting of trees follows riots last week, with protesters calling for Premier Supra Mahumapelo to step down. During the protest, a bus was torched and a man arrested for public violence. North West public works and roads spokesman Tsholofelo Mathibedi said there were plans to maintain the roads. “People must be patient and the service will ultimately come to them,” he said.
