BURNING and looting continued overnight in Mahikeng, North West. The protests, and demands for the removal of North West premier Supra Mahumapelo, were sparked by the deaths of two patients at a local clinic. The province’s capital city remained in total shutdown and shops were looted in surrounding villages such as Itsoseng in Lichtenburg. Streets barricaded with burning tyres, while a police nyala, a car and truck were set on fire. Angry protesters made it clear they wouldn’t stop unless Mahumapelo stepped down. Some threatened and stoned journalists’ cars, saying they didn’t want to be identified. Others threatened to burn down Mahumapelo’s house in Mahikeng and his guest house in Moruleng, near Rustenburg. Colonel Adele Myburgh said nine suspects were arrested in Montshioa and surrounding villages for public violence and malicious damage to property. The suspects are expected to appear in the Mmabatho Magistrates Court soon. Courts were closed yesterday and no schooling took place. Deputy ANC provincial secretary Suzan Dantjie said the provincial council supported Mahumapelo. But the ANC Youth League in North West expressed concern and support for the people of Mahikeng and hinted they, too, wanted the premier to quit. Youth League spokesman Tshiamo Tsotetsi said: “We want the person who’s going to take over from Mahumapelo to be selfless, a person who will be able to step in and bring change.”
