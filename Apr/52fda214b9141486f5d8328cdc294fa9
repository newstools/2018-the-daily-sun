RAYMOND Ngobeni is miserable. All his savings have gone down the drain. The 42-year-old from KwaGuca extension 1 in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga told Daily Sun he saw an advert on the internet for people needed to distribute diesel and saw it as a great business opportunity. But now Raymond claims he has lost all his savings and wants his R25 000 back from the fake company. He said after he applied to be one of the distributors in Mpumalanga, he was called to attend a workshop. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuAJazp4j36LqKGbv4D-8azGSVy0MROEi8s4H9lcTnv6pCEHEpPyNyZ7VmsEFJbH8sqcpB-E1rQKD1sdcaqWgzYpbk7gIkYaFASH7M_NSIsTyOo9kSRW4cM8kiAyLnLNlTdyOHUHAcpSeXt7odRkLCv2H_apSwffjB5WDIWHDXgskqJwm-2WY0BwTuI51jKAUNVM7Pm4gTwnZn5xZudcRgOy7bFSHlac2Sly_taZ_pScELnZWW7hxhDFYL25TZGeE7oXKdMebcPKCV8jOups26JJtYyWx0G\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzE2LCqu0c2adEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I was told the money was for stock and banners to advertise the business,” said Raymond.“The stock was never delivered. I tried many times to contact the company via emails and phone calls but with no success.” Daily Sun phoned the number on the documents he got from the company but they did not seem to exist. According to a search on the internet, one entry said it was found to be a fake company. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi advised Raymond to open a case as he may not be the only one who has been conned.
