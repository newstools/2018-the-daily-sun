It’s been happening for YEARS! Had I ever nje(just) worried more about what people who don’t even know me were saying, I would never have married the love of my life..."She indicated that she was happy to let people talk as always while she goes on living her life with the love of her life."People sometimes feel that we should all function on the same level, want the same things and if you go against what they would do, you’re a target. I’m glad I believed and trusted in my emotions. Maybe a sense of maturity and serenity played a role as well... I don’t know...I repeat, love the one you love and let them continue to talk."
