 The 32-year-old from Botshabelo, Mangaung makes toilet paper holders to survive. Morena Ramabele used to work for a construction company before starting his business three years ago. “The business has changed my life. I am now able to make enough money to support my family,” he told Daily Sun. “I collect old steel in the kasi and turn it into beautiful toilet paper holders. “I sell my products for R80 each, including installation.” He said business is doing well because he has many customers in the kasi. “I make about 20 holders a day and many people buy my products. “I’m grateful to the residents for their support.” Morena told the People’s Paper nothing made him happier than knowing his customers were satisfied with his work. “I can make more than 20 holders a day, but my challenge is the lack of steel material,” he said. “I’m requesting Good Samaritan out there to sponsor me with steel material so I can make more than 20 holders a day.” Morena said unemployed youth should think of different ways to survive. “The unemployment rate in the country is high, so people should come up with unusual ways to make money. “It’s wrong to complain about unemployment when you can use your hands to earn a living.”
