Otherwise bodies will pile up at mortuaries,” Hlengwa told the People’s Paper.He said last week he felt traumatised at a cemetery in Inanda where he saw a half-buried coffin. He said the family was forced to bury a loved one in a shallow grave because there was no space available.The burial sites shortage has created a headache for mayor Zandile Gumede. Last month, she came under fire from the CRL Rights Commission. She was told her burial recycling policy was unconstitutional. Chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva gave her until 25 April to get legal advice on the policy or meet the commission in court.Mayoral spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said the task team appointed by the mayor would look into land shortage and the policy’s legality. He said its report would be ready by the time the commission came back. Asked about the land grab threat, he said there was no need to grab land.He said the municipality was working to secure land legally.
