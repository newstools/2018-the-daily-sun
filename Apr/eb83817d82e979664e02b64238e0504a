THE fruit and vegetable shop looked like any other, with various produce on display. So when residents kept seeing customers arriving but leaving empty-handed, they smelt a rat. Metro police were tipped off and when they raided the place on Wednesday morning, drugs with a street value of thousands of rands were found at the shop, as well as cash. Ekurhuleni Metro police paid a surprise visit to the Odogwu African Fruit & Vegetable shop in the Edenvale CBD at about 10am. Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said the officers found 10 ziplock bags containing crystal meth and five more containing cat. The estimated street value of the drugs was R3 300. “A 35-year-old suspect, the shop’s boss, was arrested at the shop in Van Riebeeck Road. “He is detained at Edenvale Police Station,” said Kgasago. “Additionally, cash amounting to R10 000 was found on the suspect. He will appear in the Edenvale Magistrates Court soon on charges of dealing and possession of drugs.”
