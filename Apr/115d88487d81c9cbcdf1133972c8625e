A MISSING hospital file has put this 17-year-old’s life on hold. The teenager from Ekangala, Tshwane has to wear nappies and needs an operation – but it can’t take place without her file. Even though she has already had several operations, she can’t control her bowel or bladder movements. Her 43-year-old mum said when the girl was born, her anus and vagina were closed. “The doctors operated on her, trying to open it but that affected her ability to control her bladder and bowels.” The mum said her daughter had several unsuccessful operations between the ages of seven and 15. They had new hope when a doctor said he had a surgical solution but they then learned George Mukhari Academic Hospital had lost the girl’s files. Her daughter had to change schools because other pupils made fun of her. “We have taken her to a school for kids with special needs. It was hard for her to adjust there,” she said. The mum said she feared her daughter would one day take her own life. “Sometimes she gets depressed and says it would be better if she died.” Hospital spokesman Zwide Ndwandwe confirmed that the teen was their patient. “We are still investigating where her file is. The reason is she had to undergo tests at different clinics in the hospital due to her condition.” He said the hospital will speak to the girl’s mum as soon as the file is found.
