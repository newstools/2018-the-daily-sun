Adam’s uncle, Barwe Maredi, said he was watching a friend’s stall when cops arrived. He and four other men ran away, but they were cornered at the dam. They tried to cross, but there were police on the other side. The friends managed to swim out, “but Adam disappeared under the water”, Barwe said.He said the other men told the family what had happened. “We called the police and divers searched for him but could not find him,” he said. Police spokeswoman Constable Connie Moganedi said an inquest docket was opened. “We are not in a position to say what led to the incident, but police investigations are continuing” she said.Sangoma Sibongile Maluleke said residents had disturbed the snake’s peace by crossing the dam.
