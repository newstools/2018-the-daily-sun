Some had moved their tables away from the spot where cardboard was covering the cop’s spilled blood. People told the People’s Paper the place was not safe.Others claimed cops bust a suspect and confiscated an AK47 near the area where the cop was murdered just two days before.“People get robbed and killed in broad daylight. We were shocked when we heard a cop was shot but not surprised, because thugs here are dangerous,” said a seller.Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula said:“It is heartbreaking when police trying to help residents become targets. They are here to protect and make residents safe. We’re doing our best to find the culprits.” Katoyi is survived by his wife and three children.
