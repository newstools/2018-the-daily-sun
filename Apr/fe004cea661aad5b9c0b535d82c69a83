Both were within the required weight limit, with Maluleke tipping the scales on 58,44kg and Dlamini weighing in at 59,60kg. Sunday’s contest promises to be a tactical battle, as both camps say they want to win every single round.Maluleke’s mentor Bernie Pailman said: “All our preparations have gone well and we are fine-tuning his speed, agility and everything else. Come the fight date we will be ready to go 12 rounds. We will go 12 rounds and win,” he said. “We will pull it off because Maluleke wants it. He will be crowned champion at the end of the fight. It is a must-win for Sydney, if he doesn’t take this one, he will have to decide if he’s going to fight in six-round bouts or just forget about boxing completely.” Talking about his opponent, Dlamini said: “It is going to be a tough fight, no fight is easy for me. And I have to win this fight. “Maluleke knows how to use his height advantage and he’s got a good jab too. “Come fight night I have to take those weapons away from him to be crowned champion. “My aim is to win all the rounds, if I get a chance for a knockout, it would be a bonus.”
