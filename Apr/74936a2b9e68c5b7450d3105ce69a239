Now I am being sent from pillar to post. Education spokesman Gerald Sambo said: “Ndlovu was appointed on 5 February 2008. He applied for payment of long service incentives but they were not approved by the department.“He applied for retirement and this has been approved by the department. His contribution to the Government Employees Pension Fund started in July 2008, which means he is disqualified from receiving monthly pension payouts. This information has been communicated to him.”
