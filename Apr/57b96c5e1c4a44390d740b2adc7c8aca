GOGO Mantoa Tsobella struggled all her life to get a proper job. And now that she can’t work anymore, she’s struggling to get a pension grant. Mantoa (60) from Makgalaneng kasi in QwaQwa doesn’t have an ID. She told Daily Sun she has applied twice, without any success. The gogo said she did piece jobs and didn’t need an ID, but in 2008 she fell ill and could no longer work. “Ever since then I’ve depended on my siblings,” she said. She said those who take care of her can’t take out a funeral cover for her. “I really don’t know what will happen when I die. “People are going to struggle to bury me,” she said. When she goes to the clinic, they ask for an ID before they can treat her. “I used my church certificate to apply for my ID because I don’t have a birth certificate,” she said. Rebecca Moshoeshoe, a supervisor at the Phuthaditjhaba Home Affairs, said her office will help the gogo. Mantoa must go to their office and they’ll check if anything needs to be corrected so she can get her ID.
