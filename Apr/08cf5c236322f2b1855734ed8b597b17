COPS are looking for a suspect in connection with a case in which a woman was raped by a man who snuck into her room while she was asleep. The victim from Kagiso in Mogale City told the police she had come home from a local shebeen with her boyfriend after 10pm last week. She went to sleep in his cousinâ€™s shack.
