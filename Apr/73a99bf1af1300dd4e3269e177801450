RESIDENTS of Nseleni near Richards Bay are angry with their councillor. They took to the streets yesterday, demanding that Umhlathuze mayor Mduduzi Mhlongo fire councillor Thabisile Wanda. They claimed Wanda is not doing her work. Lalo Mpanza (41), a ward committee member, said: “We are tired of a councillor who doesn’t do her job. “There’s no development in the area and when we call her to the meetings, she doesn’t come. We want this councillor to go.” Another resident, Makhosi Mkhwanazi (33), said they were angry with the councillor because she couldn’t give them answers about a new mall being built in the area. Wanda said the rumours that she wasn’t doing her job were spread by people who hate her. “I refused to meet residents because they wanted an informal meeting under a tree, and it was only men at the meeting.” Wanda said she and municipal officials were supposed to meet the residents yesterday night. Mdu Ncalane, a spokesman for Umhlathuze Municipality, said speaker Slondile Mkhize was expected to speak to the residents yesterday. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said about 2 000 residents blockaded the R166 with burning tyres and stones. “The situation is calm and police are monitoring the area.”
