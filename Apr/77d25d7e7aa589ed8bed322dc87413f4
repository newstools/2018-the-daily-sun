assertions made in this regard.""It has now been officially communicated to me that the

not expressed any misgivings in respect of South Africa's stance on the
expropriation of land without compensation," Mthethwa said in a statement.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>According to Mthethwa he did so in full recognition and
appreciation of the excellent relations that exist between Britain and South
Africa.The statement said that in March this year, Mthethwa read media
reports on online platforms about the alleged statements of the British
government.Subsequently, at a Human Rights Day commemoration, Mthethwa
"repudiated this alleged stance of the British government, asserting South
Africa's inalienable right to self-determination as a sovereign state",
said his ministry.The British government subsequently issued an "official
communication" indicating it did not hold the views indicated in the
reports.As such, Mthethwa had chosen to "unreservedly withdraw"
his response.
