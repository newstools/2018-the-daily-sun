Police struggled to control the crowd who blocked the road.Cops had been called to escort the hearse to Rondebult Cemetery where Bongani was to be laid to rest. His mother, Lindiwe Tshabalala (45) said her son was a churchgoer who died for something he didn’t do. She said on the day he was murdered she was woken up and told residents were assaulting her son.“I rushed to the scene and couldn’t believe what I was seeing. “They were throwing things at him and beating him up,” she said. “I tried to stop them but they threatened to kill me too.”Lindiwe said she could hear her son calling her name and all she could do was watch.“I went to hide at a nearby shop and when I came back I found his lifeless body lying on the ground. “Bongani loved to go to church and provided for us.” Community leader Agnes Makhubela (34) said residents were angered by the arrest of three local residents. “Some of those police were at the scene when Bongani was killed and did nothing,” she said. Police spokesman Lieutenant- Colonel Mack Mngomezulu said a case of murder was being investigated. The suspects will appear in the Boksburg Magistrates Court today.
