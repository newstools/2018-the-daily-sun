He said the value could be more,” said the official. Brian said this wasn’t an isolated incident and many people lost things. “I’ve been travelling on football matters for a long time now. This happens, I suppose,” he said. Police spokesperson Katlego Mogale said a case of theft was opened and no arrests had been made. “We’re in the process of getting footage that will help us finalise the case,” she said. OR Tambo spokesperson Leigh Gunkel-Keuler said: management was disappointed by such incidents. “Procedure is that the airline resolves the claim. As an airport, we support the airline with any information we may have to help them with a claim.“Payments in relation to baggage claims are usually done by the airline and not the airport.“Maybe, Mr Brian Baloyi made a claim with the airline he used at the time,” she said.Brian refused to tell the SunTeam which airline he used for travel.
