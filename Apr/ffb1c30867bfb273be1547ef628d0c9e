NDEBELE artist Esther Mahlangu’s dream of building an art school will soon be realised. The 83-year-old who recently received an honorary doctorate from the University of Joburg got another surprise on Friday. The Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency gave her a R50 000 cheque at her house in Siyabuswa, Mpumalanga. Eric Kholwane, MEC for finance, economic development and tourism, said the government would work with the agency to make sure her dream was fulfilled. “We don’t have to wait for her death to honour and recognise her good work because we have an icon worthy to be taken care of,” said Kholwane. Gogo Esther told Daily Sun she was grateful the stars were about to shine on her. She said the school would ensure the Ndebele culture is celebrated for generations to come. “I’m truly grateful to be honoured while I’m still alive. “I’ve been doing this for years and it has been my wish to transfer my skills to young girls in the area,” she said. She encouraged young people to use their hands and embrace their African culture. Head of the agency, Johannes Nobunga, said they would do whatever it takes to make sure gogo Esther’s legacy lives on. “The role she has played in promoting the Ndebele culture is very important to us. “We will continue to support her by making sure the school is built.”
