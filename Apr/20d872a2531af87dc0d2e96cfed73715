Gogo Malerato said: “My friends and my family love my special porridge, so I decided to try and sell it to others. It was a great idea as my customers love it.“I bought the ingredients and went to the streets to sell the porridge. At first, it was difficult because business was slow but now many workers and locals eat my porridge for breakfast. “One of my friends told me I should wake up early to market the porridge because most people don’t get a chance to prepare breakfast first thing in the morning. “Sometimes, it’s a struggle when it’s raining because I don’t have any shelter.” Gogo Malerato said she was happy that she was feeding locals while supporting herself. “It’s great to work for yourself. My dream is to have my own restaurant so I can create jobs for other people. “I’m very happy to be making money from my own product,” she said.
