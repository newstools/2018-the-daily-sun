We need this money to maintain and build roads in our province,” said Meyer.“The proposed levy would have to undergo parliamentary processes before it is implemented. “We have given ourselves between four and five years to do that. At this stage, we are only investigating the possibility of such a levy. Nothing has been finalised.”ANC provincial finance spokeswoman Carol Beerwinkel said: “The Western Cape is already suffering from the drought, which has had a negative impact on farmers and food prices. This extra price shock is coupled with one of the most expensive vehicle licence tax fees in the country.”The Western Cape Congress of South African Trade Unions said the proposed levy would cause headaches for workers.“Cosatu opposes the proposed fuel levy. It is a backward form of tax that will have a huge impact on workers. The levy will cause transport and food costs to increase,” said provincial general-secretary Tony Ehrenreich.Cape Chamber of Commerce president Janine Myburgh said: “Most poor people drive old cars which are not fuel efficient. That means they will be paying more than the people who can afford new cars.”Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse chairman Wayne Duvenage said: “This is absolute nonsense. We cannot do this to our people. “The government is crippling consumers.”
