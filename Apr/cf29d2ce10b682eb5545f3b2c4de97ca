Local rapper Sho Madjozi is a #StyleCrush for her unique and colourful style. This beauty really knows her style and image. She's not trying to copy anyone and she's serious about creating her own unique image that sets her apart from the rest. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Her signature looks are cornrow braids, colourful traditional Tsonga items and sneakers. Sho Madjozi's style has a hip hop edge to it, which is fitting because she is a rapper. She also sticks to her roots by adding Tsonga traditional clothing items to every outfit she wears. See pictures below of Sho Madjozi's fabulous style:  My single #Huku dropping tomorrow ??????????????A post shared by  Maya (@shomadjozi) on Mar 8, 2018 at 3:10am PSTEveryday I fall more and more in love wit this shoe!!! #TN forever ? new track #Huku coming soon ??A post shared by  Maya (@shomadjozi) on Feb 11, 2018 at 4:26am PSTOne of the things I’m learning while shooting #TheHistoryofXibelani is that xibelani fashion has been changing and evolving for centuries. And usually it’s the artists who introduce new styles of wearing it. It’s actually our duty to move culture forward.
