THREE men have escaped from the Joburg High Court after receiving life sentences. Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said detectives had launched a manhunt for them after they escaped on Thursday. “They were sentenced for the murder of a family in Lawley in 2016. “Criminal and internal investigations are being held to see if anyone may have been responsible for assisting the prisoners to escape.” “They escaped while being taken to the truck transporting them between the Joburg High Court and Joburg Correctional Services,” he said. Dlamini said the police provincial management is holding a high level investigation to make sure that anyone who might have helped the prisoners to escape would face the full might of the law.
