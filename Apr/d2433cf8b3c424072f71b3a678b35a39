George Bizos answered his phone and recognised the voice of his friend, Nelson Mandela. “George, I have married trouble,” said Mandela, who sounded proud and excited. “I need your help. My wife has been arrested for assaulting a police officer,” he said. This was in 1958, shortly after Nelson (39) and Winnie (22) got married. Bizos, in his book, 65 Years of Friendship, tells the story of his first meeting with the young Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, a defiant and beautiful woman.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuoZvKsEIfSPPxDtiC6ZXjVIYJWwSGW2qbxKFm2lmaHC5-exI2INTcoGYi2kw_j4pOhoVgV2lV-hLCNiLKe7ZJY207lfTXdqGpL6UXMTwBwViuQ4XMgpufxf0n8tE5XOy9FPw-WQ1DNogiTIWEFEl1gK9yGN1JvQgH2YwxeedQPly_MwVQQOVjZi7BjXdND82l_7JOBYfVkVP07xTFwUrtLaP1qq4Iw0wWlt2TtNkb8nkHjyDPQR5nFzjNo0SgKby2Mu5e8Wfazkx-aQVktMus-KtR_p0Y\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKm7yp1RANGVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The following evening Winnie arrived at my chambers. Elegantly dressed, she was as striking as she appeared in the wedding pictures I had seen,” he said. Winnie told Bizos how she had been woken up early in the morning in her house in Vilakazi Street, Soweto by Detective-Sergeant Fourie. He was there to arrest her for her role in a protest meeting about passes for women. Fourie opened her bedroom door while she was dressing and tried to pull her outside. She resisted and threw him to the floor. As he fell, he pulled her dressing table down on top of himself and fractured his neck. When she appeared in court, she insisted on a Xhosa translator, but pleaded in English. When Fourie testified in Afrikaans, she insisted he must speak English.Winnie was acquitted. The ruling was that the police testimony was contradictory.
