PROPHET Frans Marima’s prayer call line is always open for prayers. But now the divine hotline is in danger of being cut off. This comes after evil fraudsters cloned the church’s prayer service line and are demanding payment for prayers. People from all over Mzansi regularly call the prophet’s line, seeking blessings. But ever since the fake call line has been there, Frans (42) and his call centre have been overrun with complaints. He said the alleged scammers demand payment of R1 000 and even more money before callers are prayed for. “We do not charge for prayers or blessings, neither have we ever accepted money for prayers,” said Frans. According to line operators Sphiwe Thwala (24) and Lesego Mbemvana (25) they started realising that their prayer line was cloned when complaints started on 8 April. “A gogo called and I answered the call,” Sphiwe said. “She told me that she had painful legs and asked me to pray for her. “After I prayed for her, she was shocked that I didn’t ask for money. “She then told me that someone was asking for money from people for prayers,” he said. Sphiwe told Daily Sun he decided to call the line himself to ask for prayers. To his surprise, the person on the line demanded payment. “We get over 500 calls per day on our prayer line, but many of them are complaints. “People from other provinces keep complaining that they have been scammed,” said the prophet. The scammers ask their victims to deposit the money before they can be blessed. No cases have been opened with the police.
