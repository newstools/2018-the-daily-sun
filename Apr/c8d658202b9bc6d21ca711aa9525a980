JOBS are scarce in SunLand, with desperate jobseekers spending the little money they have on submitting CVs.When the City of Tshwane advertised job vacancies, thousands of young people sent in CVs. The applicants were expecting to be called for interviews, only to have their hearts broken.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss-9DXjhYP-SIR6n70eBx2q8Kpm2XCuq6zByrOhEzLD8-Ef1AKXq919EO2mD8V5GaM8oJj8TVSiAY0LPLhg_kNYxKtq6nkr2hWV727qUhtgiWHTBNKcdn8rRQCRbM1oW4_9wMepnuelf0o8poCB3xF48ihy2mGNX-djh1U_6MgHSNxnFQPRlP9XKH08w1faX_JHPdpldgNyt5WFnOw7aLPOyTDcOjiKndUY4FCyQUs94FHIrHORRp8s0HkSbXTps0AU39IUN85oFBx7WO3ZfiJ3c2_sY2Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHvithke6TtBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Scores of angry SunLanders called Daily Sun to complain about the matter. The residents said they felt they had wasted their time and money.One of the applicants, Africa Maleka (23), said the advertised jobs were a PR stunt. He said the posts were probably filled before they were advertised.“The municipality was playing with people’s lives. It was wrong of them to use desperate people like us for their dirty games,” he said.Municipal spokesman Selby Bokaba said city manager Moeketsi Mosola called for an urgent investigation into the transporting of the application forms.He said the forms were being packed at the city’s office in Temba. From there, they would be transported to the one-stop centre at Bothongo Plaza West. Mosola said the images of the bakkie were disturbing as they gave the impression that this was how they handled job seekers’ confidential information.“I have called for an urgent investigation into this matter because this is not how we conduct business. “This is an isolated incident that we are treating with the urgency it deserves. We will soon report the outcome of our investigation to the public.”
