It is with a heavy heart that I address you today.As I struggle to accept your transition, I take solace in
the fact that you have risen to become one of the brightest stars in the sky
where you will remain ever present and radiantly shining. You will continue to
serve as a guide to your loving family, your grateful nation, our beloved
Africa, and indeed, the world.The extraordinary life you led is an example of resilient
fortitude and inextinguishable passion that is a source of inspiration to us
all of how to courageously confront challenges with unwavering strength and
determination.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsspqzNxcqjJomFFG6xcggXrV-P5K8Lt4NHhkc3J-z5oViuuODyYYMlWvhxEzpHcAx2tCCTSzLcOnzSIIuNDEIZew8h0NbfdzVmYpbmcsnA1dSZtiZrSF_iMWufkkiwWHxqtVc8mJI3lhCHIlZ-QTrzaFRiP_hP1Oi2FuUoLN7d2-x4C_VoBTs0o3iLPcGqQWIQYVG-1gcq9TvDHUnaJoACsdTnFW4saOcMTcat_0b2JEcJ0Iyjj-pQHVFRQbD7qD1CGZMxbdOiYv6fL1Hr565rgNTR0l8VP\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzC9wXo_ugvJgEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

and your stylish beauty.Fortunately, stars shine brightest during the darkest of
hours. I know you will continue to illuminate our sky, even through the storms
and clouds. Your legacy will be an uplifting beacon from which we can continue
to draw guidance and strength during difficult times.You loved our people unconditionally and sacrificed so much
for our freedom. It is my prayer that as befitting tributes are paid to you
both at home and abroad, all of us will internalise the values you helped to
mould and birth into existence.As a nation, I hope we will stand tall and proud, and as
uncompromising as you were in the defence and protection of our rights. As one
of our brightest stars, continue to be the lioness that protects your children
and your grandchildren. Warm their hearts so that while your transition may
shake them, it does not break their spirit.Your legacy is everlasting. Take a well-deserved rest in
peace, my BIG sister.Love and Respect Always,Your little sister, Gra√ßa.
