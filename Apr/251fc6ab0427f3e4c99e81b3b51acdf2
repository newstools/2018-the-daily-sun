HUNDREDS of mourners can’t go to funerals in Nelson Mandela Bay because of the bus strike. They depend on buses to ferry them to various graveyards around the metro. Over the weekend, people didn’t get to say goodbye to their dead loved ones as the national bus strike intensified. Zukiswa Mtyatyeni (52) said: “It was very painful not to have been able to attend my childhood friend’s funeral. “I was looking forward to saying goodbye to her one last time, but because of the bus strike I wasn’t able to get to the cemetery to say goodbye,” said Zukiswa. Nomakhaya Mali (39), who buried her mum on Saturday, said: “On Tuesday I went to Algoa Bus to book transport for mourners, but I was told they were on strike so I wouldn’t be able to book one. “We ended up hiring taxis to ferry mourners and many people were left behind because we could only get two taxis,” she said.
