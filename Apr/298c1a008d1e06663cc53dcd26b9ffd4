AFTER he lost his sight 11 years ago, Sipho Madela learnt to use his ears. The 35-year-old from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni can interpret sounds to connect with his surroundings. He told Daily Sun: “I am happy I can communicate well.” Sipho was born with sight but started going blind when he was 23. While growing up, he had cataracts and went to the Katlehong School for the Deaf and Blind and Filadelphia School in Soshanguve, Tshwane. He said being blind has forced him to adapt to a new way of life. “If you are able to see, you can tell if something is wrong. “When you’re blind, you have to use your ears to listen to things like footsteps and use a cane to touch things,” he said. Sipho said blind people must be able to hear things like when a car stops or starts. He works as a ward committee member in his area, representing the elderly and people with disabilities. “I help them with employment, education, housing and support groups.” Sipho said he also belongs to the Re-Ikemetsi Support Group for the Visually Impaired. “We empower members with skills to better their daily lives.” He has also learned to use a talking computer and cellphone. “Hearing is the air I breathe and the eyes I’ve been given for a second chance.”
