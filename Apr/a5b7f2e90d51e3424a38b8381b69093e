He ran the race with the Gugs Running Club and was raising funds for the Nelson Mandela Children’s Foundation.He ran 21km in two hours and 45 minutes.After completing the race, he said: “This is just the beginning. I do not see myself as a disabled person. It was a very challenging race, but it was worth all the sweat.” Cameron Dugmore, who also ran the race, wrote on social media: “While running very slowly near Kirstenbosch, I bumped into a member of the Gugs Running Club helping Ipeleng by clearing the path in front of him. “He needed help and I covered the back to keep runners from bumping into his crutches. “We all reached the finish together, just before the cut-off time. I have never witnessed such courage and determination,” said Cameron.
