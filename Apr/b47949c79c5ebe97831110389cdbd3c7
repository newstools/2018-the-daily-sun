Mzansi superstar rapper AKA, just realised yet another one of his dreams this past weekend. The WWE is in Mzansi and the local rap sensation was there to rub shoulders with the superstars. The rapper, whose real name is Kiernan Forbes, was invited to make a special appearance in front of a sold out crowd in Johannesburg. The Supers Mega, who is a lifelong WWE fan, didn’t even get his hands dirty but he still dished out some lusty blows in the ring. “You are now looking at a boss, I’m the leader of the band now go ahead and play with your guitar,” he told Elias. AKA described his WWE moment as a ‘dream come true’ and said “If you truly believe in yourself ... you can make ALL your dreams come true.” The Congratulate hit-maker was extremely proud of himself for representing Mzansi Hip-Hop on one of the biggest shows in the world. "This is a moment for the culture...SA hip-hop on WWE...what?! Are you for real? If you told me that this would happen back when I was 12 years old, I would have told you in a high pitched voice that you're out of your God DAMN mind," he added.
