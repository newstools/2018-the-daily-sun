THEY had a nasty argument with their neighbour which led to one of the Bhengu sisters facing charges in court for what she said. But now they suspect their neighbour is behind a mystery fire that gutted their home. The family of seven from KwaMashu, north of Durban, has been left devastated after suspected vutha burned everything in their house yesterday. Ayanda Bhengu (26) who lives with her sister and their five kids, said although they didn’t want to point fingers at anyone, they were concerned that the mystery fire occurred shortly after her sister had a heated argument with their neighbour. She said the problem started when the neighbour began building a retaining wall. After the dispute at the weekend, cops arrived to arrest Ayanda’s sister. This was after their neighbour said she had accused her of bewitching them. Ayanda said she was on her way to work when she got a call from a neighbour to say their house was burning. She said her sister had left for court already and the kids were at school. The neighbour refused to comment as the matter is in court. Her daughter, Sthandiwe Msomi, said: “My mother is a sangoma. “If you insult her, you insult her ancestors, who called her to become a sangoma,” said Sthandiwe. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a 31-year-old woman was arrested and charged.
