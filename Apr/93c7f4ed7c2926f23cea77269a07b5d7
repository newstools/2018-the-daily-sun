THESE shack dwellers claim that for nearly 10 years they have been buying electricity from residents of nearby houses. But they decided recently that paying between R150 and R250 a month was too much and made illegal connections. Now the shack dwellers of Tsakane extension 9, Ekurhuleni and the residents of houses in extension 10 are at each other’s throats. Shack dwellers leader Thokozile Mabuza told Daily Sun that the residents in the nearby houses are accusing them of causing power outages. “When we were paying them, there were no complaints. Now that we are doing it our own way, they are threatening to burn down our shacks,” she claimed. “We aren’t going anywhere. We want the councillor to speak to the government to give us electricity.” Thokozile said since the Easter weekend, the people in the houses have been cutting their wires. Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said they condemned the illegal trade of electricity between the shack dwellers and the people living in houses, as well as the violence. “We have plans to develop the area. We have been interacting with the residents. If they have any grievances they can raise them with the city,” he said.
