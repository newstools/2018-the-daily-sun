PIitso Mosimane has OFFICIALLY confirmed Khama Billiat’s departure at Mamelodi Sundowns. “It is good for Khama to leave Sundowns having won his last championship with us,” said Mosimane after clinching the Brazilians’ record eight league titles: 2017-18; 2015-16; 2013-14; 2006-07; 2005-06; 1999-2000; 1998-99 and 1997-98. “Khama has been with us for five years, and this (PSL title) was a good farewell present to him.” The Zimbabwean refused to renew his contract with Downs having signed pre-contract with a team of his choice. The Brazilians offered Billiat a good offer in January, but the 27-year-old, a darling of Downs fans, seemed to have made up his mind that he is leaving Chloorkop next season. He has been linked with a move to PSL giants Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs, but the player has refused to reveal his next destination. Billiat, who joined Downs in 2013 from Ajax, is also linked with a move to Europe and Asia. In his five years in Chloorkop, Billiat has won three PSL titles, Nedbank Cup, Telkom Knockout, Caf Champions League and Caf Super Cup. He has also achieved individually, having won the PSL Player of the Season and Players’ Player of the Season (2016). Meanwhile, Mosimane remains resolute that his star player, Percy Tau, deserves to win the PSL Player of the Season this time. “Even if he does not win the PSL awards, to me Percy is the Player of the Season. Sundowns to me is the Team of the Season,” said Mosimane.
