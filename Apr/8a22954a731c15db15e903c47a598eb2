THREE members of this Tshwane family can’t talk or hear, while another is partially blind. Everyone relies on Johanny Randall (38), the only family member who’s not disabled. They rent a three-roomed shack in extension 1, Nellmapius. Johanny told Daily Sun he and his wife were crammed in the shack with his parents and another relative, while his mum and dad are waiting for an RDP. He said he is struggling to cope and sometimes they have to ask their relative for food. “I hope the municipality can speed up its allocation so we can live in a proper house. My mum registered in 2000 and is still waiting. “When we go to check, they always tell us the system is down.” Johanny said his wife and parents receive grants but don’t have enough money to build a house. “We can only afford to rent a shack,” he said. Johanny said he’s originally from Eersterust, but had to move to Nellmapius with his family because he couldn’t afford rent there anymore. Gauteng social development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said officials would visit the family to assess their situation. Tshwane mayoral committee member Mandla Nkomo said they are clearing the backlog of people who applied for housing between 1996 and 1999. “It’s difficult to promise anything as we have a waiting list,” he said.
