The ANC on Friday once again called on members who wish to support former president Jacob Zuma during his court battle to do so in their private capacity. "It is important that members who would prefer to go to court to pledge their own support, do so in their own capacity as individuals," said ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe in a video posted on the party's Facebook page.   "We also stated preferences on how we would love to see them conducting themselves to the extent that such conduct should be in keeping with upholding the good name of the ANC," he added.   if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsskwt-FYihuz5UrAhynDn3c5M4c6QQu99ArGfOOPJsPEeqrJU8TIaCgxkr_z_K8eSruZ6jRmqwKYP5jj0PJwTZZFmB7LfQ2Xu7AnL3jpEQR-MVfrVAZWubfUc0aJrge5Lclv80ZLQwNnGCr7-DuHpXw2M3YxX-4sjov5XAgYryGcfX9JFPMG3l6-vU1xTYJCxyQOcqobFwLfEgvFEIK6Fzk-3DHi2_1RVtwpxy96wTqDFpIDXWHjHYk8HLZWW5vezL5N4hMqJHDXSQwKk1J_Y6gB7z1mWdc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKg4CJlkjAQ1EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
