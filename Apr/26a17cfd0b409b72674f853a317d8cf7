Mulenga made his mark in the PSL midweek when he scored a cracker, arguably a contender for Goal of the Season, to help Pirates beat Bloemfontein Celtic 2-1 in a league match at Orlando Stadium.The goal that brought joy to Bucs fans is crucial to their bid to beat leaders Mamelodi Sundowns to the Absa Premiership title.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuZDvky8okpXbB-G_DgBbaWPPOkbcb0jBLdebjKuW2Csm-Ga6eQtgipNSfUtahsKslfuk767PcZeiheeI9R6VnbCTi7VnRvsyteG0930jHTGSn5aUfNg0Kd_i6fjHp6Sv2vH6qGYIU0RyThncfwu63ggODU_t73J-v_OWLr03-8Y1Xtjr39eeCcY-dpXzK0u4o7VVBqDRz_McWwaccwYnmObBuwj2uQrVbOYPzcBIriTtQS1K5OwGJpmu-m09dkNVokjent89C4ngK3Pa4IYstFPQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKVVoNvKhNlMEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

His goal from long range against Chippa United got the most votes. Bucs coach Milutin Sredojevic and midfielder Musa Nyatama were crowned Coach and Player of the Month winners for March. Said Mulenga: “When the coach introduced me I knew what to do. It’s not the first time I have scored such a goal – I am used to it. I am a new player here, I have to do my best in the remaining games so that I can start next season with full confidence.”He added: “What my fellow Zambians have done for this club is a big achievement for them. I am eager to achieve even more. It’s my time now.” Sredojevic says Mulenga is more than capable of helping Bucs succeed: “Mulenga decided the match with a wonderful strike and I am happy for him. It’s the reason we brought him here. “I am certain the goal will boost him to help the team win matches.”
