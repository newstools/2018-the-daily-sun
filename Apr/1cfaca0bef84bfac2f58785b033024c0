Limpopo reggae superstar Colbert Mukwevho is causing confusion as to why he missed a gig he was already paid for.According to Tlou Setumu, event organiser of the Blouberg-Makgabeng- Senwabarwana Festival, Colbert was paid R25 000 in cash when he agreed to perform at the traditional music festival in Senwabarwana near Bochum, in Limpopo.But he failed to pitch. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The 61-year-old, who’s affectionately known as “Harley”, allegedly pocketed the moolah and deliberately pulled a no-show in December last year. According to Tlou, preparations with Harley were done weeks in advance. They agreed with him that he would set the stage alight in the evening after all traditional music performers. Tlou told Sunday Sun: “It’s disappointing as he’s a superstar in the reggae genre and the community was looking forward to his performance.” He also revealed that the singer was given proper directions in advance and was still confused as to why Harley missed the gig. “When he was contacted days after the show, he claimed he got lost, despite the fact that we booked him weeks in advance and gave him directions.“We’ve suffered a double blow, no performance and no refund,” said Tlou, who added that they were also struggling to get the singer to pay back the money. “We’re demanding a full refund, but he’s been sending us from pillar to post. He initially said he would pay us back in February, but we haven’t heard anything from him,” said Tlou.When contacted for comment, Harley blamed his no-show stunt on a communication error and denied missing the gig deliberately. “We were relying on cellphone communication with Mr Setumu. We tried calling him when we reached Bochum. His phone was off all evening, but we tried asking people where the event was,” he said. Harley also denied being given directions weeks before the festival, but said he was willing to pay back every cent, but would have to do it in installments. There was no form of email or documents that specified the place exactly, it was all based on verbal communication and his phone was off on the day,” he said. “The money has already been distributed among the artists and it’s going to be hard for me to pay from my own pocket. “But I’m willing to give him R5 000 every month,” said Harley.
