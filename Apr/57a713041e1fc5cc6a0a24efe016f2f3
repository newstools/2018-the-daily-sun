Lesemang Matuka, the department’s spokesman, said the audits were in line with the regulations of the Mental Health Care Act 17 of 2002 which states that NGOs must be audited at least once a year. Acting head of department Mkhululi Lukhele said he was happy with the department’s efforts to ensure the licensing process was flawless. “The safety and care of mental health users remains key to us,” he said. Lukhele said the department has planned to host workshops to help NGOs understand and implement the new regulations. “The department would like to take this opportunity to dispel allegations of delays in the payment of subsidies. “There is no truth in this and there are no recorded incidents or complaints about the delay or non-payment of subsidies to the NGOs.”
