THREE family members were shot dead simply because they didn’t have money. According to a family member, Kelebohile Hlalele (32), a lone gunman stormed into their Clocolan home in the Free State on Sunday night. “Everything happened so fast,” said Kelebohile. “The thug demanded money. He became angry when he found out they were penniless.” Kelebohile said he opened fire and shot 61-year-old gogo Miriam, her 23-year-old foster son Thabiso Malefetsane, and gogo’s four-year-old granddaughter Karabelo at point blank range. Thabiso was preparing supper for the family when the incident occurred. “We were in the bedroom. The killer held a gun to Thabiso’s head and demanded money. “My mother said there was no money in the house. The thug became angry and shot my mother in the head. He also shot my child.” She said Thabiso put on a brave fight but he shot him as well and jumped out of the window. “It was like watching a horror movie,” she said. “My mum and daughter were lying in a pool of their own blood. “I wish we had money, I would have given the thug everything to spare their lives. “This will haunt me for the rest of my life.” Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said: “We are investigating three counts of murder. “We appeal to anyone who has information to contact the police.”
