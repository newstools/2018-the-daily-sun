IN A desperate attempt to hold on to their PSL status, new Platinum Stars owners Rawat Petroleum has dangled a fat carrot in front of their players should they succeed in keeping the club in the money-spinning league.Dikwena are languishing at the foot of the PSL table – six points short of their closest rivals Ajax Cape Town, who have 24 points while Roger de Sa’s charges have 18.There is a R125 000 bonus for each player should they survive the dreaded axe hovering over their heads.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuwMgogBonbB_FN09LHwyptqnCzuxZpQPOzkoolPYoSt_QOJ1nG-tzoPTa0tZOgfWPd7pEijdUfVmNdPbBy4Ka0cD1Cwc2pmJSTolyP9fgE5-9NhzDXT0G5vK3f0m_-_eIdpXQY4i8DzdjkSr3B4ysXEbCVohJBYyyQ8Nr5S2hCzyjDJCCohWtawPyP4lB7vdHfqn16ksvKTww73AreWQJQWqtH1aCMsJaWUNv68ZcKwqoyho5EayQkjWgEdLjP0u2Wnpu3zAN32b-79gr0YA0lTA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIuFmm-9XU-HEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But still they are not winning.” Stars assistant coach Mxolisi Dlamini, who was in charge of the team against Baroka as De Sa was suspended, said they were not ready to throw in the towel yet.“We are disappointed,” he said. “But we are not pressing any panic buttons yet, we still believe. Mathematically we are still in with a chance and that gives us hope. We cannot shout or blame the players at this stage because we need them.” Stars host Polokwane City at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm).
