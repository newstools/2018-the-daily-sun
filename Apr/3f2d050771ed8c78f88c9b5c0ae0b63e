PALESA Manaleng just cannot be ignored. In 2014 she was in a cycling accident that left her paralysed from the waist down – but that has not killed her commitment to sports. Palesa, with a hand cycle, will be cycling from Tshwane to Cape Town next month to raise funds for people living with disabilities. Although a group of 12 people will be accompanying her on the Global Journey For Change, she will be the only athlete using a hand cycle. The other participants will be running the 2 200km over 10 days. Palesa said people with disabilities still felt rejected by society and she wanted to change that view. “The journey will be about educating people and showing the public what we are capable of,” she said. “During the race I will be the only hand cyclist. Everyone else will be running and we have one gentleman who is deaf. Another man will be running with us on crutches. “It will be the 12 of us against the world as we head for Cape Town. “Six of us will be running during the day and the other six in the evening.” The group will leave on 10 May and they are expected to arrive in Cape Town on the 20th.
