IT IS common that when people get married, they invite only family and friends. But that was not the case for a Cape Town couple who tied the knot on Saturday. Kevine (27) and Falone Zeka (24) got married in the Evangelical Outreach Church in Parow. And the couple invited people from Vukuhambe Disabled Centre, homeless people and the elderly. The guests received gifts and were well fed. Speaking to the People’s Paper, the couple said inviting poor people was recommended in the Bible. “The word of God says we must love one another, especially the poor,” said Kevine. “We need to reach out to them and show them love. “I was humbled and honoured when they accepted my invitation.” The breathtaking bride, Falone, couldn’t hide her joy after tying the knot. “We’re grateful as a family that we could share this day with people in need,” she said. Vukuhambe Disabled Centre leader Thozi Mciki (52) said the invitation meant a lot. “As people with disabilities, we hardly get invitations to places like this or get treated like guests of honour. “We say may God bless this marriage. We know marriage comes from God and we’ll pray for it to be fruitful.” Gogo Muriel Johnson (63) said: “I was invited by a friend. They didn’t say I couldn’t come because I wasn’t invited. “They actually gave me a gift instead of me giving them one.”
