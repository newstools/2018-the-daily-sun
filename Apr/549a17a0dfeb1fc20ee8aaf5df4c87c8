The people of Pholile squatter camp are rejoicing because they will finally have electricity. The SA National Roads Agency and the City of Cape Town came to an agreement to bring power to the kasi. Residents have been without electricity for over 10 years. They were forced to make illegal connections. These sometimes resulted in shack fires which claimed many lives. Last year a family lost five people in a single fire after wires were mixed up. Earlier this year, a child died after touching zinc that was lying on top of an exposed wire, while another child died in a shack fire. Nonceba Ndyalivane (40) said: “Some people will never understand how special this is to us. “We have buried more than 20 people here. In all our prayers we have never forgotten to ask God for electricity. We’ve even asked religious leaders to pray for the area.” The R4,5 million project started last week. Mayor Patricia de Lille was meant to visit the kasi to inspect the progress but was prevented by residents who were protesting over a blocked canal. She said: “A team from the Urban Development Authority have been sent to Nomzamo to investigate and assess what work needs to be done. “The city is committed to ensuring concerns raised by residents are attended to immediately.” Bongani Ngqulungqa, who lost a relative in a shack fire, said he’ll only be happy when the first light is switched on in the kasi. “We were promised the project would start early this year. I don’t trust the municipality anymore.” Local councillor Jongidumo Maxheke said he called a meeting last week to tell residents the news and they were happy. MMC Anda Ntsodo said the project was expected to be finished by June. “The project was delayed due to discussions around the use of local sub-contractors but the matter has since been resolved.”
