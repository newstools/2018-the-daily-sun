Makhosi
Khoza has officially retired from politics! In a letter
addressed to the leadership of the African Democratic Change (ADeC) over the
weekend, Dr Khoza said that she wants to pursue her passion in local
governance. She also
said that she wants to pour her efforts in the “education and elevation of African
languages as those of prestige and prosperity.” Dr Khoza,
in her announcement, maintained that when she assisted in the founding of ADeC,
she was not intending on occupying a political position. Dr Khoza
said that a “promising potential opportunity” has availed itself for her to
contribute positively to education and local governance. “South
Africa is in an atrocious state of education and the continued disgraceful,
shameful, reprehensible and discreditable stunting of African languages. “The black
indigenous languages account for 79% of the South African population according
to Statistics South Africa, 2011, yet they continue to be confined as those of
tradition and culture as intended by the apartheid Bantu Education policy,” she
said. She also
slammed the government for its stance on African languages in the education
system. “ It is my
well-considered view that a nation that condemns and downgrades 79% of its
population as secondary linguistic citizens in their ancestral land is guilty
of perpetuating indignity, inequalities, racial inferiority complex and
entrapment of its citizens in the vicious cycle of intergenerational poverty,”
she said. She also
said that her son, who is a computer programmer and computer science student,
has developed an algorithm that will assist Dr Khoza’s goal.
