Who can shoot at, let alone kill, a 12-year-old child?”Some residents said Somalis committed the murders but the minister said they shouldn’t repeat things they didn’t know for sure. “You don’t have proof of what you are talking about. You are going to confuse us now,” Cele said.He added that the community had to let the police do their work and that cops would arrest whoever was responsible for the killings.“Tell the criminals I said, ‘hello, we are coming for you’.” He urged the community to come forward and report criminals.
