AT first, the parents of identical twins Megan and Sophie
Walker had been worried about Megan.The 11-year-old lost lots of weight, felt nauseas and
tired.Then, out of the blue, it turned out that it wasn’t Megan
who was sick at all. It was her apparently healthy twin, Sophie, who was
diagnosed with cancer.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuOLE-DeFUCT_4SH8Ud8utQPCY0Syicgiaxlp3cvKQQqs8tLcnuO9fF7PQkabZw46nj6xQo7ZMl4UNQRbVpvKSMay3kjaGIqX_pwWZi1fQeMKE_h-0V7wEqh1vxKcvwHBI2rsYBeGwROTAhsKuJo-AocEhmH87Vv6Q5XJQZTrNfEAxx2sCdEx8SyvuA6hEYKHCA0SV7whv1-Jw-xllcnsxbX4svvT8pQsN4dAoMuEd3-squbqmuBHsi3Oc0UUgN7kbCnoCmm_lUxo8Ue5CW5g26NNo8GsbKiPrYNA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEU-I8BnS9GyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Mail, the nightmare began for the inseparable twins from Edinburgh late
last year. Worried about Megan, her parents took her to the doctor
where she had all kinds of tests. But doctors could find nothing wrong with
her.Then, out of the blue, Sophie – who still seemed healthy –
was given some tests. She was diagnosed as having a cancerous tumour on her
kidney.Their mum Rebecca (37) said: "It was heartbreaking.
There was no indication anything was wrong with Sophie.”She and dad Jamie (39) have been trying to understand why
Megan would have shown the symptoms of the sickness her twin actually had."They've put it down to the fact that they are
twins. They think Megan was showing us Sophie's symptoms before we even knew
Sophie was ill," said Rebecca.Sophie had the cancerous tumour removed in December in a
seven-hour operation. She has lost all her hair because of chemotherapy and
will continue the treatment until June, when hopefully the cancer will have
been cured.The twins remain as devoted to each other as ever. Said
Rebecca: "Now Megan wants to be with Sophie more than ever. I don't know
what she would do without her."The twins also have the love of seven other siblings to
support them – James (15), Emily (14), Lucy (12), Daniel (8), Olivia (6), Ella
(4) and Nathan (3).
