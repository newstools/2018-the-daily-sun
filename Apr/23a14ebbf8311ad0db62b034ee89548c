MPUMALANGA Social Development MEC Busi Shiba has warned Sassa beneficiaries not to give their personal information to anyone. Her warning follows reports that there are fake officials who are trying to steal from beneficiaries. Shiba said the fraudsters tell beneficiaries they can help them apply for new Sassa cards. “Sassa would like to caution beneficiaries not give out their personal information, including the pin codes for their social grants payment cards, said Shiba. She said fraudsters might use the information to make illegal deductions from their payments. She said they would like to clarify to all beneficiaries that new applications will be handled at Sassa offices and not on the streets. “The new cards will also be issued at Sassa offices, as well as the identified service points or at post offices,” she said. Shiba said beneficiaries who have old cards must not panic as they will continue to work until 31 December. “We will communicate with beneficiaries directly. “When it’s time to change the cards, the official communication will be done through the right channels,” she said.
