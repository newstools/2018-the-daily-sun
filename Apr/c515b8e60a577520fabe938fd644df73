A R13.5m property owned by former train boss Lucky Montana
was allegedly partly funded with money from dodgy dealings. The money can be traced back to a beneficiary of dodgy
contracts worth R4bn from the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). According to News24, money from controversial Pretoria
tender mogul Mario Ferreira found its way to his former business partner before
the latter used it to buy a sprawling property of more than 6 000m2 in the
sought-after Johannesburg suburb of Hurlingham. The property was then registered to Montana's name, even
though it was paid for by third-parties linked to Ferreira. This is the clearest indication to date that Montana may
have scored suspicious benefits worth millions of rand linked to contracts of
about R4bn awarded by Prasa to Siyangena Technologies, a subsidiary of
Ferreira's TMM Holdings group. Siyangena and Prasa were harshly criticised in former Public
Protector Thuli Madonsela's 2015 report on the embattled state-owned entity.
Siyangena was appointed to install access gates, security cameras and other
related products at Prasa train stations across the country. Most of the affected parties strongly denied that the
property transaction and related dealings amounted to anything irregular. Montana did not address any of the queries about the
property, but instead fired off an angry SMS in which he accused News24 of
racism. Appearing before a parliamentary inquiry into state capture
earlier this year, Montana insisted that he has never been involved in
"corrupt activities". Montana provided MPs with considerable detail about his
other property dealings following earlier media reports, but he failed to
mention the Hurlingham transaction. News24's investigation has found that Montana now stands to
pocket R20m in profit from selling a property that was bought on his behalf by
third-parties linked to Ferreira. SOURCE: NEWS24
