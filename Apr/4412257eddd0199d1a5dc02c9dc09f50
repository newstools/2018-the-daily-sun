The audience can expect dirty, nasty and funny jokes. Nobody cares, least of all Somizi. So, if you think someone is going to walk away from this hurt and saddened, then you are watching the wrong show. That’s what soap operas are for.  I don’t think I am the scariest person Somizi has come across in this industry. We are going to have lots of info, good stuff and juiciness. Some people will cry but it won’t be Somizi,” said Gareth.The first phase of tickets are now sold out but due to popular demand, an extra one hundred tickets have just been released today at Computicket with prices ranging from R200 per person.
