Her popularity is indeed proof that the people on the ground know who their true leaders are. Mam' Winnie was a special hero to the people. She is also respected for having lived among her people in Soweto when many post-apartheid leaders left the townships for the suburbs. This shows that her struggle was genuine and never about the perks and nice life that comes with occupying a government position. This is a woman who stood against all odds and survived the cruelty of the apartheid state which sought to break her down her entire life. In her own words, there is nothing the apartheid government hasn't done to her. She was subjected to the worst form of treatment but still she rose. When her husband, Nelson Mandela, was jailed for 27 years she was left to raise their two children alone while keeping the flames of the struggle burning.  She dedicated her life to the people of South Africa.Since her death was announced, I have been watching developments in the country and wondering if the ANC and the rest of us really know the role she played in the struggle for liberation. There are circumstances that makes me believe that her contribution to the struggle was somehow nearly forgotten while she was still alive. Her absolute popularity caught most of us by surprise after the news of her death broke out. Truth be told, as a nation, the only time we were prepared for a big and popular funeral was for late president Nelson Mandela. We knew in advance that it was going to be massive, hence millions of Rands were set aside to cater for the funeral. Sadly, some of the money ended up being looted by greedy officials.Mandela was so big that we have also heard stories of how senior journalists were fighting in newsrooms for the right to cover his funeral way before he died.Now judging by the latest developments, it would be safe to say Mam' Winnie's popularity equals that of Nelson Mandela and may exceed it.After the announcement of her death there was a narrative that nearly clouded her legacy, but South Africans were quick to dismiss it with the contempt it deserves.However, what made it even more difficult for rumours to go away was that even people in her own party, the ANC,  believed all along that she was responsible for  Stompie Seipei's death. This is one of the key factors that prevented her from being elected into the ANC deputy presidency position in 1997. Now that those who framed her have come out in public to confess, those who believed these trumped-up charges are left with an egg on their faces. The documentary Winnie, produced by Pascale Lamche and played on eNCA on Wednesday night, gave us a new perspective on Mam' Winnie. It showed her full contribution to the struggle against apartheid, those who were closest to her, and those who sought to destroy her radical character.  The documentary revealed how the apartheid government planned well in advance to tarnish and destroy her character because she was thought to be too left wing.  The aim was to also separate her from Nelson Mandela. But what is more painful is that the apartheid government was aided by some of her closest comrades in the ANC to achieve this. These facts leave one to conclude that the apartheid government was not exactly powerful on its own but was assisted by some members of the ANC who sold out their own leaders for pocket money. The mission for her character assassination continued when she was the only ANC comrade to be hauled before the TRC by her own comrades. They wanted her to "confess and ask forgiveness" for the murder she had told them several times that she did not commit. Mind you, when Mandela was in prison she was the only person who Mandela trusted with legitimate information from the outside. The documentary revealed how she was betrayed time and time again by people that she trusted and who had infiltrated themselves into her life. They were all paid informants working for the apartheid states, in fact even  Mandela Football Club was full of police informants . There was also a special apartheid government propaganda machine as mentioned by Vic McPherson of Stratcom in the documentary.The propaganda machine included 40 journalists that were paid just to assassinate and destroy her character, most especially after  Mandela's  release from prison. They realised how powerful she was and how much she was loved by the people. Their aim was to tarnish her reputation so that the people would turn against her. They also aimed to separate her from Mandela and keep them apart.  But after all of these she still rose to the very top. Lala Ngoxolo Mbokodo, the Mother of our Nation. Mzansi  shall forever cherish your role in the liberation struggle.
