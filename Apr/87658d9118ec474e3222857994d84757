Former coach Cavin Johnson came back to haunt former side Platinum Stars as they were relegated from the Absa Premiership after a 2-1 defeat to Amazulu at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium. Dikwena - who finished third last season - will end the current campaign bottom of the standings and will now ply their trade in the National First Division (NFD). In a cagey first half the visitors looked to gain the upper hand with Jabulani Ncobeni and Butholezwe Ncube both trying their luck from range, but the AmaZulu duo missed the target within the first 15 minutes of the game. It was an evenly balanced match and Wangu Gome pulled the trigger from range in the 21st minute, but he was denied by AmaZulu goalkeeper Siyabonga Mbatha. Luvolwetho Mpeta was presented with a chance to shoot and he forced Mbatha into a good save as relegation-threatened Stars piled pressure on the visitors. The last chance of the first half fell for Bonginkosi Ntuli, who was also denied by in-form goal-minder Mbatha on the stroke of halftime. AmaZulu then stood firm at the back and the score was 0-0 at the interval. The visitors took a surprise lead when Ovidy Karuru headed home Sbusiso Mabiliso's cross to make it 1-0 to AmaZulu in the 61st minute. Ex-AmaZulu striker Ntuli then tried to haunt his former side 11 minutes later, but he was brilliantly denied by Mbatha, who was having a good game. Stars were left vulnerable at the back when they pushed forward and they were punished by second-half substitute Mhlengi Cele. Karuru set up Cele, who beat Stars keeper Mbongeni Mzimela to make it 2-0 to AmaZulu with seven minutes left on the clock. It was end-to-end stuff as second-half substitute Letsie Koapeng grabbed a late goal which proved to be a consolation goal as AmaZulu held on to their lead to win 2-1 on the night.
