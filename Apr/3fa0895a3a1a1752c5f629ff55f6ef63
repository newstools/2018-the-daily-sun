JOY was the order of the day for fans when Team SA visited Sammy Marks Square in Tshwane yesterday. The crowd couldn’t believe it when master of ceremonies Patience Shikwambana announced that the athletes would also be taking pictures with the public. They immediately called for gold medallist Caster Semenya to come down from the stage. “Caster, Caster, we are here,” the crowd called. The event was also attended by Minister of Sport and Recreation Tokozile Xasa, her deputy Gert Oosthuizen and president of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee, Gideon Sam. Athletes such as Akani Simbine and Chad Le Clos posed for pictures and signed autographs with the public. Minister Xasa called the athletes role models and great ambassadors for the country. She said the team flew the South African flag high. “We want more people from the community to become athletes and join you in representing the country. “South Africa is a winning nation and we associate with you. You made us proud.” Melva Masikane (23) said she never thought she would be posing for pictures with the athletes when she came to town from Soshanguve. “I begged my sister to accompany me to town and she refused. She’ll regret it when I show her the athletes’ photos.”
