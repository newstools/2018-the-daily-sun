THE City of Cape Town is worried about a spike in water consumption. Collective water consumption has increased by 5% from 516 million litres to 542 million litres last week. Deputy mayor Ian Neilson has called on residents to use less than 50 litres per person per day. He added that dam levels have also declined by 0,5% to 20,9% due to high temperatures and evaporation. “It’s crucial to lower the daily usage to 450 million litres to keep within the water department’s allocation to the city. “If this is not attained it will not be sufficient to see the metro through until December,” said Neilson. He said the City would continue its drought interventions, which included Level 6b restrictions, pressure management and repairing leaks as soon as possible. “We have made great progress so far, but we are not yet out of the woods. “We must continue to keep our use as low as possible. “Although the winter months will likely bring more rain, we cannot estimate how much rain we will have, or count on it having a significant impact on our dam levels”. Meanwhile, gatvol activists marched to parliament to oppose the City of Cape Town’s water and electricity tariff proposals last week. The march was organised by two groups, Stop COCT and Save Cape Town and Stop COCT. STOP COCT founder Sandra Dickson said the proposed 26,9% water and sanitation services increase and an 8,1% rise in electricity tariffs were unjustifiable. “How can they expect the working class to pay about 25% more on a municipal bill?” she asked.
