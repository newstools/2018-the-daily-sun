PROTESTS against North West’s Premier Supra Mahumapelo have claimed the life of a teenager. Kitlano Leeuw (16) was allegedly shot dead by cops in Taung extension 6 on Monday. His sister, Bonolo, told Daily Sun: “He was shot while running away. We want this matter to be thoroughly investigated because cops were not allowed to use live ammunition. “Kitlano was in grade 10 at Pinagare Secondary School and he was a talented soccer player. There were only two of us and we were raised by a single parent.” The protests, which started in Mahikeng last week, have spread across the province with communities in Bloemhof, Stella, Taung and Ganyesa joining. Mahumapelo has been accused of fraud, corruption and maladministration. North West police spokesman Colonel Sabata Mokgwabone said: “A murder case has been opened against a cop accused of killing a boy. The case has been handed over to Ipid.” Sanco called on Ipid to investigate allegations that live ammunition was fired at protesters by the police. Provincial Sanco chairman Paul Sebegoe said: “We wish to convey our condolences to the Leeuw family and other families who lost loved ones under these trying circumstances. We appeal for protests to be conducted peacefully and with dignity.” Sebegoe urged communities not to allow criminals to use their protests. “Looting, destruction of property and attacks on foreign nationals undermine the goal to highlight genuine service delivery concerns.” He said he hoped allegations against Mahumapelo would be probed. “Decisive action is urgently required to restore public confidence in governance and uproot corruption, which has robbed our communities.”
