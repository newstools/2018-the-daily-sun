They have been together for well over a decade now and they are not showing any signs of slowing down. All the while they have been one of the most exemplary couples in Mzansi serving up relationship goals at will. As an indication of how head over heels in love they still are with one another after all this time, Connie took to Instagram to post the sweetest birthday message to Shona. “This is the day God made! For He so LOVES me, He gave His most special son, to be my soul mate, my life partner, my husband, my children’s father, grandfather, the love of my life!” she wrote. “I never knew true happiness until you came into my life! Happy Birthday my Skat! Words alone can never express enough what you mean to me and how much I love you! All I can do is thank God for, YOU Happy Birthday My LOVE!” she concluded.
