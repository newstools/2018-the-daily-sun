THERE is still a big poser on who will be relegated at the end of the current Absa Premiership season. In danger are Platinum Stars, Ajax Cape Town, SuperSport United, Polokwane City FC, AmaZulu, Golden Arrows and Bidvest Wits.But the fact remains that one team will be relegated on 12 May when the curtain comes down on the 2017-18 season.On the other end of the table, Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates are the two main contenders for the league title.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstrn0_1uda5BMzTeSRxpEUN8uclApnjil5-HuttaOTmOH3elxUQjuA85qDzU4iIKhWH0cQ-Zp2sblvUa2QBFI33cAtZXDNT6SDG7ZWXGREVqsZHMW9Hmudcp30z-RmzKxsdY6JFdB07igRRaZDXAKZTskZ4DRytukltcbitHV8ouZL4FiKvIl1Hm4HsvgdDVbB7tU4EP9TmGxBE2yy106Bz8MYomj9t7-scvmEkntaxgsBP4aTiXz5siJOaBxavGsC54eGUDINVzMRpcPjp9ZH3YwI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAaH56j4SHMkEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The league is tough now and all teams want to improve and get better every season.“People never thought they would see teams like SuperSport and Wits in this situation.” Igesund said even bottom side, Roger de Sa’s Dikwena, could still pull off a surprise move and avoid the axe.“We have to wait until the last game of the season,” Igesund said Dikwena have 21 points – and four games left. They are six points behind second bottom Ajax.
