WHEN they saw cops they thought of jail! They threw three plastic bags that were in the car out of the window. But the police had already spotted them. The cops followed and stopped them and then they went back to pick up the plastic bags. What the cops found inside them was enough to send the suspects to jail. The two foreigners, aged 54 and 55 years, were taken to the Springs police station, where they were charged with dealing in drugs. Captain Johannes Ramphora of the Springs cop station said poice officers were conducting a stop-and-search operation on Hills Road, Selection Park, last Friday. “The police noticed a blue Dahaitsu with two suspicious occupants. The police followed with intention to search. The suspects threw three plastic bags out onto the ground when they saw them,” said Ramphora. “The plastics contained drugs suspected to be Mandrax tablets.” The two suspects were immediately arrested for allegedly dealing in drugs. The total number of tablets in the stash was 1 326, with a street value of R80 000. A case docket of dealing in drugs was opened for further investigation. Springs police station commander Brigadier Thembeka Gwebushe applauded the officers for their dedication and enthusiasm in keeping Springs free of crime. The two suspects will soon appear in the Springs Magistrates Court to face charges of dealing in drugs.
