IT WAS a heartbreaking story that brought them together. The family of a seven-year-old girl welcomed their hero, Anthony Ezeh, with open arms over the weekend. This was after Anthony’s selfless act saw him catching the little girl, who moments earlier been thrown from a two-storey building by her dad (27). The sad incident happened in Bloemfontein on Wednesday night. The girl’s gogo (47) and her madala (47) from phase 4 kasi in Mangaung said he was suffering from depression. “Before he attempted to commit suicide, he threw his daughter from the building but she was caught and saved by Anthony,” they said. He later jumped and died the next day in hospital. The grieving family said they regarded Anthony as their hero, who saved them from having two funerals. “It breaks my heart that he died but I’m thankful his daughter survived,” said the gogo. Police have opened an inquest docket for investigation.
