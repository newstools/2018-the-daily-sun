POLICE are still on the lookout for three suspects who shot and killed a motorist on the M1 highway in Joburg yesterday. According to reports, the man was shot and killed while travelling north. The suspects are said to have been heading in the opposite direction. The man was shot eight times as he approached the Glenhove offramp on Wednesday afternoon. According to EWN, the shooting is linked to a Hawala money exchange scheme operating out of the Oriental Plaza. The shooting is believed to have been a hit and may be linked to a recent spate of kidnappings associated with the Hawala network. Hawala is an informal, unregulated system which allows money to be transferred out of the country. The money is paid to an agent who then instructs an associate in the relevant country or area to pay the final recipient. Witnesses said after the suspects shot the man, they jumpped into their vehicle and sped off. The dead man is said to be of Indian or Pakistani descent. Motorists who saw the shooting said three men jumped the concrete barriers on the freeway during heavy rush-hour traffic. They said it appeared the men were specifically looking for the victimâ€™s white Audi A4. The suspects shot the tyres and opened fire on the man. The victim was declared dead on the scene. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said cops are investigating cases of murder and attempted murder. Masondo could not confirm the Hawala scheme allegations and said he had no information about the matter. He said cops are appealing to anyone with information that could lead to arrests to contact their nearest police station.
