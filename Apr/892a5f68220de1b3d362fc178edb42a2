SIBONGILE Mthethwa might not be able to raise her hands or stretch her legs, but she’s a positive influence on everyone she meets. The 36-year-old from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, is a motivational speaker and helps other people living with disabilities find purpose in their lives. Sibongile said she was in and out of hospital as a toddler. She has very stiff joints in her arms and legs due to a condition called arthrogryposis “I couldn’t sit until I was about four years old,” she said. “These days, my right side is stronger than the left and I use it to push my wheelchair, eat and put on make-up.” She said she gave motivational speeches at the end of every month with the Veza Bantu Association for People with Disabilities. “I tackle different issues like terrible experiences at taxi ranks,” said the mum of a five-year-old boy. She decided to become a motivational speaker after visiting her aunt in Bronkhorstspruit in 2005. “I did a broadcasting course with Kangala Community Radio Station and I was given a slot,” she said. “The first day I didn’t know what to talk about. “I decided to encourage the listeners. “I spoke from the heart and mostly about my personal experiences. “I saved a girl’s life with my talk. She had intended to commit suicide.”
