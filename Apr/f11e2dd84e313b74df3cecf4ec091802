The Economic Freedom Fighters said it has been alerted of
nefarious and evil plans to assassinate their leader Julius Malema. The EFF said it is not taking the threats lightly. EFF acting national spokesperson Tebogo Mokwele said the
covert plans come from reliable sources who indicate that a small group of
politically insecure and insane individuals from the North West Province have
approached drug dealers and assassins in different provinces, particularly in
the Western Cape to assassinate EFF President. "he threats from this group of politically insecure
and insane individuals are informed by the fact that the EFF is on the verge of
politically defeating the ANC in the North West Province, and other provinces
in the upcoming general elections. "These threats are real and should not be taken
lightly because the North West is one of the provinces known for mysterious and
unresolved political killings. "These security threats also form part of several
threats coming from right-wing forces, who use social media, private caller
identities, and fake emails platforms to pose death threats against the
leadership of the EFF," said Mokwele. She said the threats are largely linked to the EFFâ€™s
uncompromising and decisive leadership of the struggle for land expropriation
without compensation and the relentless war against racism. The EFF has alerted the Minister of Police about the
death threats and expect that action will be taken against each and every
threat posed on the leadership of the EFF. Mokwele said the EFF has also worked on strengthening of
internal security because they are aware that cowards, who have no convincing
alternate political programme against the EFF, are now resorting to thoughts of
violent and fatal suppression of a genuine political alternative.
