She never returned and since then I have been staying with her three-year-old son.”On realising it was getting late and Mbali had not returned by late afternoon, she called but Mbali’s phone was on voicemail.“I heard from people that on the day of her departure she was seen taking a taxi to Durban. I was puzzled because her boyfriend stays in Clermont, so if she was going to see him she should have gone to Pinetown.”Elizabeth said that with police help she searched everywhere, even at hospitals and mortuaries.“Probably she got a new boyfriend and he killed her,” she said. “Her known boyfriend said he has not seen her. If she is still alive and safe, wherever she is, she should call us so that our minds can be eased. We won’t deny her the freedom she wants.”She said both Mbali’s parents had died.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane appealed to anyone with information to call CrimeStop (08600 10111).
