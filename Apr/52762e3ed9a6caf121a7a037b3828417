FORMER Umhlobo Wenene FM presenter Phumzile Zonke is being hunted by a faceless stalker. He recently posted on social media that a woman claimed to be his twin sister. “Last week, I discovered I have a stalker who calls my office every five minutes and sends emails every hour claiming I’m not who I think I am,” said Phumzile. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuZcxASjN-3_ENt-PgGAQlsZmRVUyAOlcLfFXeBgc41hmjk_32yVBTQfOHuu2yqkdzzMfvCuPlB2IyT18M1YvVWyjK-MSTIXV_eImYyGKgIWeCxW7NxyXMO_2ZZys8BZo4H6pCyfCT5CQBvJheDsBAedvTfVO_XcwrmA169z1_Au9ZjA-ikQewtjJ-vQD0oTJkaGm15XkijAC3BTxf4NZMq0bNBhUYJ2qlipL3OwsAtZ7xxx0XFBiVaB0NfTUhndc7DKAKgCAsQmlZKJeKjS8_1Cja0jJctitxVGS4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDTJJ1xai_UgEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

She says we must go and look for a third sibling before they kill him. I don’t think this woman is stable but I’m terrified of what she could do to myself or herself. Something is terribly wrong with her and I wish she would leave me alone and get professional help.” Phumzile told Daily Sun the woman started calling his office at the SABC last Wednesday. “She calls and screams that we need to run away together to find our missing twin brother. What shocked me most was that she called my mother by name. I need to get the number she is using to harass me in order to open a case and trace her.”Phumzile said she had sent two emails over the Easter weekend. Doreen Mokoena, a cybersecurity officer, said a lot of people reported cases like this but they rarely went to court because cops didn’t have the resources to deal with them. “Tracing a stalker is simple and anybody can do it. However, we need to remember these people are not as dumb as we make them out to be. Some go to the extent of using programmes to alter their location or use voice disguising devices,” she said.
