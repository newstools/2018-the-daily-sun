We release these entries for the industry and music supporters to be kept abreast of the developments as we progress through the stages of the SAMA. We also do so to avoid any surprises when we announce the final nomination list in the next few weeks," sad Nhlanhla.In order to qualify for entry, recording companies and other interested parties go through a stringent vetting process presided over by RiSA officials and record company representatives that have ensured that the entries meet all the eligibility requirements.Those who ticked all the boxes have now been handed over to a panel of independent judges drawn from radio, television, newspapers, blogs and the recording industry for judging.The SAMA office will then release only five nominees in each category as voted for by the panels and verified by an independent audit firm.
