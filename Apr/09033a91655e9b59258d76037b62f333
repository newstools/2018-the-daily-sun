“Life was better before we moved here. We would connect electricity and our gadgets worked. Now our fridges and TVs are just for decoration,” said Thumeka Mpama (28), from Enkanini, Khayelitsha in Cape Town. Thumeka is one of many residents who feel as if they have been forgotten since they were moved by the City of Cape Town to create space for a school last December. The residents say the city failed to keep its promises. They say they were told that electricity and water would be connected as soon as they got to the new place, but they still don’t have electricity or water. When they were living in their previous homes they say they had water and connected electricity from neighbours. “We can only buy meat for the day because we don’t have electricity to keep our fridges on. We wish we hadn’t moved because since then, nobody cares about us. “It seems as if we were dumped here and forgotten,” said Thumeka. Ward Councillor Andile Lili said the residents are to blame for the delays. “They are the problem, not the city. In December they delayed the process. This was after they were misled by the councillor candidate who lost the race to me in the previous elections. “Therefore, the contractor couldn’t start working because of the confusion. Then it was December and the contractors closed down for the holidays,” said Lili. However, he has spoken to the city and said contractors would start work this week. City of Cape Town MMC Anda Ntsodo said: “We have already started the installation of electricity and water. The city has budgeted for it. “We would never relocate people without a budget. The delays occurred because they moved in December when contractors were closed for the holidays.”
