TODAY WAS DIFFICULT!!!... it’s in the last few weeks that @zolekamandela allowed me to share her granny ????... it’s a gift I will FOREVER cherish. My granny lives in the same street as mama, and I went to a crèche literally NEXT door mama’s house. I remember peeking over to try spot her or tata... but a conversation with her is something that will resonate with me for all of my days. Firstly she said I look much smaller in real life!! You can only imagine my shock at the fact that WINNIE MANDELA knew who I was!!! ...the peeking toddler!! I asked her about “Winnie” the doccie and told her I had watched it on Netflix!! She ask d me what time it played and what they had said about her. I told her they reiterated her role in the struggle and how grateful we all were...especially as women, to have her as a leading example. She gave me a kiss on the lips and said that she was glad!! @zolekamandela assured me she had seen the doccie and told me to stop crying!!! Thank you for your heart, your grace and for sharing your granny with us!!! @zolekamandela I’m forever indebted to you for this captured moment ????A post shared by  Thando Thabooty Thabethe (@thando_thabethe) on Apr 3, 2018 at 8:06am PDT
