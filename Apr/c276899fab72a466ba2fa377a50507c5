He said there was a struggle before they gunned her down. Tembe said two witnesses heard the shots. “These thugs come and kill our officers while they are out there trying to save lives,” he said. “I want to appeal to the community to help us catch these murderers. I also appeal to communities to protect us, because we are there for the community.” Tembe said Zulu was survived by her four children and husband. He said also that part-time Metro police employee, Alfred Malomo, was shot in Ivory Park, Ekurhuleni, last month while he was helping a pedestrian. “All these suspects have not yet been arrested and we need assistance from the community to catch them,” he said. Joburg’s mayor Herman Mashaba expressed his condolences. “The sad passing of our colleagues is a personal loss for me as well, as I am responsible for this government and its thousands of employees,” he said. Public safety MMC Michael Sun called for a specialised task team to investigate the murders.
