He said his family was his source of strength. “My mum is the reason I didn’t give up on life. “Disabled people must love themselves so that others can accept them.“People treat you the way you treat yourself. When you feel sorry for yourself, they will pity you. “I also want to encourage people without disabilities not to criticise what they don’t understand.”
