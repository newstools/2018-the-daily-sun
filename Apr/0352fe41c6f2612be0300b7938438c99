BONANG MATHEBA AND LORNA MASEKOBonang Matheba and Lorna Maseko.
Photo: InstagramAfter her friendship with Somizi failed to stand the test of time, Bonang did not take long to find a new BFF in Lorna Maseko. They are both successful and beautiful and they both have style, that does not always make the best combination when it comes to friendships but these two seem to have made it work.These two gorgeous ladies are friendship goals to say the least and they solidify their friendship by taking extravagant trips every once in a while.
