The utility started its negotiations with the municipality in January after paying R150 million in December. The situation at the municipality made headlines when the water supply was cut at the beginning of the year during an intense heatwave in Gauteng. This led to protests over the water supply in certain communities, including Palm Springs. Other areas that were affected by the January water cuts included Vanderbijlpark, Evaton West, Evaton, Lakeside, Sebokeng, Rustervaal and Roshnee. Mohale said this was a last resort for the utility because all other efforts had failed. He said they had informed water and sanitation Minister Gugile Nkwinti and Gauteng Premier David Makhura of the water board’s intentions. Emfuleni municipal spokesman Makhosonke Sangweni said he would release a statement soon. – NEWS24
