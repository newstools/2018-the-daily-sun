JOBURG Metro officer Ayanda Zulu was gunned down at her home in Palm Springs, Vaal, nearly four weeks ago. Today her body is still in the mortuary. This comes after a disagreement between her family and her partner as to where she should be buried heads for court. The case will be heard in the Joburg High Court today. Ayanda’s sister, Thembi Nkabinde (53), told Daily Sun the family wanted to bury her in KZN among her ancestors. But her partner, Leonard Zulu, wants to bury her in Joburg. Leonard’s family believe that it is entitled to bury her since they paid lobola. “Yes they paid lobola but the makoti was not traditionally handed over to his family. “As Ayanda’s family, we have the right to bury her in the place where she was born, together with her ancestors,” said Thembi. She said Ayanda’s husband knows very well that the marriage process was not fully completed. She added that the family was going through tough times as they didn’t have money. “We were forced to take loans and pay lawyers over R20 000,” she said. Thembi said since Ayanda died, no one from her family had seen her body. “Even her mother has been denied this, which is inhumane. My mum has been in and out of hospital since my sister died.” Daily Sun tried to call Leonard but his phone has been off since Friday. Daily Sun published the story on 5 April.
