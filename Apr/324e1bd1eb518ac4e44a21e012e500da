  I’M A 25-year-old married woman who is very unhappy. I’m a stay-at-home mum who keeps the home fires burning. But I want to go back to school so that I can get a decent job 
because my mother-in-law criticises everything I do. She keeps reminding me that I don’t bring anything to the table. My husband doesn’t even bother to stop her. How do I confront this 
woman? She should draw the line somewhere. From Makoti Hey Makoti People’s opinions that are hurtful obviously affect us 
negatively. It’s clear the relationship that you have with your mother-in-law 
is not easy. However, confronting her will not help you or make matters better. 
It’s time to do some introspection. This means finding yourself and following your true passion in 
life. When you are content with who you are, you automatically receive and 
spread positive energy.
