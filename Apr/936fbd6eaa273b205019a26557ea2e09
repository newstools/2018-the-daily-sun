WHEN their sister Jane Ringane died in 2008, Grace (59) and Maria (64) promised they would take care of her property. After Jane’s husband died in 2010, they got the shock of their lives when they got to the house. Other people were already living there. One of the occupants told them the husband’s sister had sold them the house in Mamelodi East, Tshwane. Maria said when they asked the “new owner” how he bought a house from someone without the title deed, he seemed to acknowledge the sale was fraudulent. “He agreed to buy the house from us for R120 000,” she claimed. “We gave him time to raise the money, but we never heard from him again.” “In 2012, we contacted him again and he promised to come up with the money but never came back to us.” Grace said they decided to evict the man in 2014. They were shocked to find that it had been turned into a guest house. When the SunTeam contacted the man, he dropped the phone. Tshwane housing MMC Mandla Nkomo advised the sisters to take the matter to court.
