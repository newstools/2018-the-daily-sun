The poles carry telephone lines to Ngqushwa Municipality and cop shops in Bell and Moyeni. The villages that are suffering because of high crime rates include Wesley, Gcinisa, Crossroads, Loverstwist, Hoyi, Tyityaba, Tuku and Leqeni.Councillor Daniswa Ncanywa urged residents to be on the lookout for the pole thieves.“The sad part is that residents buy these poles from the criminals and use them to erect shacks, kraals and fences. “We must stop doing this because it only motivates these thieves,” she said.Telkom spokeswoman Gugulethu Maqetuka said they would work with thepolice to create awareness. Campaigns will teach members of the community about the consequences of stealing telephone poles.Bell Police Station’s Captain Nomhle Mbunge said: “This is seriously affecting the station. The bad cellphone signals in some areas means we cannot call people. Others take advantage of the fact that they have our private cellphone numbers. They call us and send bad messages.”Police spokeswoman Captain Mali Govender said cops in Ngqushwa were investigating the matter. She said more than R12 000 worth of damage had been caused by the thieves.Govender said: “Anyone with information should contact their nearest police station or call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.”
