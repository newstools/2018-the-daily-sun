NELSON Didi is worried about his younger brother. The 45-year-old from Freedom Square in Mangaung, Free State said his brother, Sam (36), has developed a craving for dogs and cats whenever he’s drunk. Nelson said he chased Sam away from his home last year after he was caught eating neighbours’ pets. He told Daily Sun he believed his brother needed serious help. “My brother was arrested on Friday after he was caught skinning a dog alive to cook it,” he said READ: MAN ARRESTED FOR SKINNING DOG ALIVE! Nelson said Sam is a nice guy when sober, but as soon as he had a few drinks, he behaves strangely. “Sam started eating cats and dogs when he was 18, but he stopped until he started drinking two years ago.” Senior SPCA Inspector Reinet Mayer said when they arrived on the scene, the dog’s carcass was lying on the side of the road next to one of its skinned legs. “Sam acknowledged the dog was still alive when he started to slaughter it. “He opened his backpack for us and there was bread, polony and a chicken nugget inside, but he said he craved fresh meat,” she said. “We immediately opened a case of animal cruelty and he was arrested.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said the suspect appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court this week.
