GATVOL Amadodana Aseweseli marched from Anderson Street to Mbombela Taxi Rank on Saturday. They’re worried about the abuse, prostitution, and killing of people living with albinism taking place in Mpumalanga. Zakhele Dube, one of the organisers, told Daily Sun: “As church members, we say abuse is sinful and evil. “Anything that destroys the dignity and life of God’s creation is surely not of God but against the Lord.” Zakhele said the church men will take part in all efforts aimed at fighting abuse, the killing of women and kids, and attacks on foreign nationals and people living with albinism. He said their march was a way of supporting programmes that educate young men about abuse. Accepting the memorandum on behalf of the community safety MEC, Solomon Shiba said the members’ concerns would be addressed.
