But when people join hands, the load is that much lighter.This was proved again last weekend when 40 volunteers of Rise Against Hunger rolled up their sleeves to pack nutritious meals into 10 000 boxes in just two hours!if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstHFZ2DSrXzqVYmgVYAE-QB0H84g_b8L9weIPWcKnDaXoEuke3g8uUVF7VTnEMBQNYFYJ9bi33WNHPeXJH4mlYF_iHwGU7_elpRL2N1m5o15ah4rcd56J231CjAlTJozNAQpHIDPgB1k6GSSETtLODZESZkloZUEmrbijzM_CVeuu2Mr7_-c8CW4-AaJTNpYS_pFQTGaZD0SHRCX4J7K__euTv7qHRtxMILyCvD9F__ZVd_Qzhqz9UNSqJhwerPee3BKfxykGzQPhlwQjFxq-sYJLOc5eA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzB8uviPmdAMuEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The packaged meals were provided to Tholulwazi Creche in Umlazi and Ikwezi Creche in Lamontville.The menu was rice, soy meat, vegetables and 23 essential vitamins and minerals. This will allow the creches to provide meals to feed kids for the whole year. Rise Against Hunger was founded in 1998 by United Methodist Church’s minister and former US marine Ray Buchanan. Sphume Khuzwayo, MegaCity’s general manager, said they were happy to join the campaign to improve the lives of members of their community.
