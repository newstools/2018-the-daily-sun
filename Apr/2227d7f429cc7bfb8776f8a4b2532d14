They must seek advice from healthcare professionals so they can live healthier lives. “We will continue to make efforts to expand healthcare across the city.”Ntsodo said the city was working on promoting individual and community welfare.City health manager Dr Virgibia de Azeveda said they were happy that people would no longer have to travel such long distances for health services.“It has always been our wish to cater to all our patients’ needs and we are happy this has finally happened,” said De Azeveda.She said even though the centre didn’t have a lot of staff members, they would work together to make sure the patients got the help they needed.“We will see what we are going to do.”Mzikayise Sokoyi (56), a resident, said they had been waiting for this day for a long time.He said: “This will make our lives better. Sometimes we’d sit at home when we’re supposed to go to the clinic. “We had to stay at home because we often didn’t have the taxi fare.”
