SunMan Jabu Kumalo described him as “a man who always had a ready smile”.“We used to call Ronnie Indoda Yamahhashi (the horseman). Many Daily Sun readers trusted his race predictions,” he said.“I used to marvel at how he changed from one language to another with ease, with the right accent and all.”Jabu said he didn’t think there was a language in Mzansi he couldn’t speak. “His language skills came in handy as different radio stations used him to commentate on horse racing,” said Jabu.Ronnie first got a taste of the racing world when he worked for betting company Tab. His break in the newspaper industry came when he joined the Sowetan as a graphic designer. He worked for the People’s Paper from 2002 and left in 2010. SunSport editor Mathews Mpete said he was heartbroken about the news of “Maronza”, as Ronald was also affectionately known.“My relationship with him dates back over 10 years.We used to have lunch together at the Daily Sun canteen. He was a quiet and sober character.” Another former colleague Zimasa Ciliwe said he became like a second brother to her.“I met Ronnie in June 2002 at Daily Sun,” she said.“We were original members of the newspaper and clicked on the first day because we both come from the Eastern Cape.”She said what she would remember most about Ronnie was his driving style. He’ll be buried next Saturday in Alice, Eastern Cape.
