He swore at me and told me he’d do something bad. He even wanted to moer me. “He stole R2 000 belonging to my neighbours. I sell meat for them. And then he burned my shack.” “I’m left with only my church uniform. The clothes I’m wearing were donated by neighbours.“My sons are troublemakers. They want me to give them money every day to buy tik and say intwaso is a waste. I don’t know what to do anymore.” Neighbour Nkosinathi Gibe (56) said: “I saw her son entering the yard with two bottles. Minutes later, he ran away from the scene. “I saw smoke and called out to people, but the fire spread quickly. Her sons make her cry every day.”Sangoma Ntombethongo Mhlope said: “They will cause trouble until they answer their calling.”
