GAUTENG Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane is calling on motorists to drive carefully. “Our authorities will be on high alert this long weekend to deal with road traffic violations. “Road safety is everyone’s responsibility and I urge motorists to ensure compliance with the rules of the road.” Road crashes and fatalities are largely attributed to the attitude and behaviour of road users. “Substance abuse and vehicle fitness are just some of the challenges that make the situation worse. “Authorities will deal decisively with people who commit violations such as drunken driving, reckless and negligent driving, speeding and freight overloading.” She said cops will also conduct mobile testing operations, focusing particularly on public and freight transport. The MEC said using a cellphone while driving and wearing earphones while walking lead to a lot of deaths. ) Three people have been killed and three others were injured following a collision between a taxi and truck on Houtkop Road in Sebokeng, Gauteng, on Thursday morning. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said paramedics found provincial emergency services personnel attending to some of the passengers. “Paramedics found the bodies of two men and a woman trapped inside the taxi.”
