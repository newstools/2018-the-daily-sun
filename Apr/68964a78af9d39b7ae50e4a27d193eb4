approximately 12:45 last night. “It was established that the one truck was
hijacked a while earlier in Koster. The injured driver of the hijacked truck
was found in possession of a jamming device. He was taken to a local hospital
but is under arrest,” she said.She said the truck as well as
the cargo was recovered. The value thereof is estimated at approx R200 0000.
Motorists are advised to use alternative routes since the entire Magaliesburg
is congested with traffic.Ernst said the one truck
driver was injured during the collision and he was removed by ambulance to a
local hospital. While the driver was still en route to the hospital, a person
came to the Magaliesburg SAPS to report that his truck was hijacked earlier the
same evening in Derby, on the way from Koster. “Investigation then revealed
that the truck which was in the collision, was the hijacked truck. “The quick thinking police
officers in the Magaliesburg SAPS immediately called ahead to the hospital and
with the assistance of colleagues from Krugersdorp, the injured ‘driver’ was
found at the hospital. The injured man was searched
and in his possession members found a device believed to be used in jamming
signals,” she said.She said suspect (25)
received the necessary medical treatment and was subsequently arrested for
hijacking, the possession of stolen property and possession of implements
believed to be used in the theft/ hijacking of motor vehicles. Ernst said the hijacked truck
was loaded with tiles. Then entire cargo was retrieved and handed back to the
lawful owner. “The estimated recovered
value is approximately R2 million. “Due to the fact that the
vehicles blocked the only route through Magaliesburg, traffic was backed up
until long after 11:00 today. This was due to the processing of the scene and
the specialized equipment needed in order to remove the vehicles. The Station Commander,
Lieutenant Colonel Joyce Julla was personally assisting in rerouting and
controlling vehicles in order to stabilize the traffic flow. Joyce was happy with the
actions of the quick thinking members in the Magaliesburg Client Centre and the
assistance they received from their colleagues in Krugersdorp. “Teamwork
firstly lead to this positive arrest and secondly, our partners, the local
Mogale City Traffic Department sorted our traffic problem!” said she.
