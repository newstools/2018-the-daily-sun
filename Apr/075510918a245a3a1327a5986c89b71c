TEACHERS have no right to make pupils choose between education and religion, said CRL Rights Commission chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva on Thursday. She was speaking in Durban during hearings aimed at investigating the mistreatment of Shembe school children. Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said the commission was going to ensure the KZN Education Department took action against teachers who continued to abuse Shembe kids despite being warned two years ago. A letter sent out by the department warned teachers to stop forcing Shembe kids to shave their hair. Growing hair is part of their religion. “I’m surprised there are teachers who continue to shave Shembe pupils, even after a circular was sent out by the department,” she said. “A circular is a lawful instruction from the employer.” She said what shocked her the most was that all the teachers who went against the orders had not been punished. “We’re going to gather all the names of those teachers and call on the department to charge them for violating the instruction in the circular,” she said. Mkhwanazi-Xaluva revealed that some teachers had even gone as far as beating Shembe kids and threatening to fail them at the end of the year. Responding to Mkhwanazi-Xaluva’s comments, the KZN Education Department’s Themba Ndlovu said they were not happy that some schools were not following instructions. “We’re hopeful the intervention by the commission will help a lot.”
