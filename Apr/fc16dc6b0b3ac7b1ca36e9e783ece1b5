DESPITE being threatened by cops, they are going ahead with plans to occupy empty schools. People are living at Bakgomana Primary School in Diepkloof, Soweto, and are turning the classrooms into their homes. Daily Sun published the story in February of residents who hired equipment to remove grass from inside the abandoned schoolyard. Police came to remove them, but they refused to go anywhere. Since then, more shacks have sprung up and the classrooms have been divided into homes. Some families are already living there. Leaders Mohapi Mofolo and Andrew Menong said it is better for struggling people to occupy the school, instead of it being turned into a hiding place for thugs. When the school was abandoned over 10 years ago local organisations tried to turn it into a skills centre but soon left. Thugs came to vandalise the place. Mary Molewa, who lives at the school, said: “They used to smoke nyaope here. We also found condoms and purses.” Mary said she hoped government would see their plan was practical. “The school has been vandalised and we’re turning it into something better. Many government buildings lie in ruins and government is doing nothing to rebuild or use them.” Koos Radebe said he isn’t going anywhere. “I’m not committing crime. I found something in ruins and decided to turn it into something useful.” Gauteng infrastructure development MEC Jacob Mamabolo said they have plans for abandoned schools. “We are not going to allow people to occupy them as it is against the law,” he said.
