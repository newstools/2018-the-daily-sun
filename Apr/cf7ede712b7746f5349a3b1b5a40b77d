An academic seminar on land expropriation without compensation was
marred by violence on Monday after EFF and ANC members clashed on the Pretoria
campus of the University of South Africa. Several of the speakers, ranging from academics to members of various
political parties, spoke on their stance on the land question in relation to
whether or not the Constitution should be amended to allow for land
expropriation without compensation 'Sellouts and cowards' Members of different political parties, including Cope leader Mosiuoa
Lekota, DA MP Gwen Ngwenya and PAC leader Luthando Mbinda, were heckled, jeered
and booed by members of the audience during their addresses. Audience members called Lekota a sellout and asked him to leave as he
gave a lengthy address about the history of South Africa. He ended his speech
on the subject of the Codesa talks. He said the ANC had made headway in
reclaiming the country from the apartheid government. "It's easy to call us cowards, it's easy to accuse us of selling
out when you don't know how we got there," said Lekota. SOURCE: NEWS24
