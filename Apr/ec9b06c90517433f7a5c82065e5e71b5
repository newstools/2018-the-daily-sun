THE lifestyles of Nelson Mandela Bay’s entire mayoral committee will be laid bare for all to see. This was the undertaking from mayor Athol Trollip, who on Wednesday announced that his executive would undergo lifestyle audits next month. “We must lead by example and ensure that as leaders of this city, we are beyond criticism,” said Trollip. “This is why we have chosen to undergo the audits. It is a reaffirmation of our commitment to being an honest, transparent government.” Trollip claimed it was the first time an entire mayoral committee would be audited. He said he hoped the move would set the tone for integrity in government. “The coalition government will work with various state institutions, such as the South African Revenue Service, during the audit.” He also urged President Cyril Ramaphosa to do an audit on all cabinet members, premiers and members of the executive. Trollip said corruption was so deeply embedded in government that high-ranking officials had amassed unimaginable wealth through questionable means. UDM Councillor Mongameli Bobani said the mayor was seeking attention instead of addressing the corruption that was happening under his nose. Bobani said: “He has not yet declared his property in council so he must do this in public.”
