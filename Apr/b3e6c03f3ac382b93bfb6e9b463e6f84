No one is safe from local funnyman Skhumba Hlophe’s hilarious jokes that sometimes tend to divide opinion. Unless you are the unlucky victim, Skhumba’s jokes will most likely leave you in stitches. While on set of SABC 1’s Thandeka’s Diary, the comedian decided to make legendary Tsonga disco king Papa Penny his latest victim when he posted a hilarious picture of himself looking a lot like the Gold Bone hit-maker. To pull off his imitation, Skhumba used a stocking to wrap around his head with a ponytail and a colorful vest to complete the look. “Having a killer time on set. Thandeka’s Diary. We taking craziness to another level” he captioned the funny picture. Whether or not Papa Penny would have been pleased by this imitation is another story, but one has to appreciate the accuracy shown by Skhumba. Having a killer time on Set..... Thandeka’s Diary...... we taking craziness to the next level...... coming soon to @mzansi_fosho #Blessed #StayingFunny #BlackBrainPictures A post shared by  Skhumba (@skhumba_official) on Apr 18, 2018 at 7:50am PDT
