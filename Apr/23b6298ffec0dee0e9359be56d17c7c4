A woman, believed to be in her 30s, was killed in a freak
accident when a large gate fell on top of her on Central Road in Fordsburg,
Joburg, on Wednesday morning. ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene at 08:03 to find a
large crowd on the side of the road. "Upon closer inspection, paramedics found the body
of a woman lying on the side of the road next to a large gate. "It is understood that the large gate had fallen
onto the woman. A number of the community members had managed to lift the gate
and free the woman a short time later. "Paramedics assessed the woman and found that she
had sustained numerous injuries to her head and showed no signs of life.
Unfortunately, nothing could be done for her and she was declared dead, said
ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring. He said details surrounding this incident are not yet
known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
