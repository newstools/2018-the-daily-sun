MPUMALANGA police have launched a manhunt for an armed gang that tried to blow up an armoured G4S vehicle on Saturday. The incident happened at 12.15pm on the road between Sabie and White River. Cops said the vehicle was travelling towards White River after collecting money when suddenlygunshots aimed at the right window forced the guards to stop the vehicle. Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said they saw a white Toyota bakkie with 10 armed men moving towards them. The men forced them out and told them to lie on the ground. According to the guards, they were searched and a 9mm Norico pistol and a cellphone were taken. “The victims said the suspects threw explosives into the vehicle but failed to complete their mission. “They then left the scene.” This is the third incident in one week. Another security vehicle was robbed on Friday at 10am at Kamhlushwa Trust in the Tonga area. An armoured G4S vehicle was heading for Kamhlushwa when the guards saw a silver BMW sedan and a gold Volkswagen Amarok bakkie following them at high speed. The occupants in the BMW apparently drove next to the vehicle and forced the driver to stop at gunpoint. The guards also saw that a group of men armed with rifles and other vehicles, including a black BMW, were blocking the road. The guards were forced out of their vehicle and disarmed. The suspects then blew up the van before fleeing the scene with an undisclosed amount. On Tuesday, a Fidelity Security vehicle was also robbed at Zwelisha, near Pienaar Trust.
