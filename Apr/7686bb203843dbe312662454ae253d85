Two people have been killed and eleven others injured following
a collision between a taxi and truck on the N12 westbound outside of Delmas on
Tuesday morning. ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on
the scene to find both wrecked vehicles on the side of the road. The truck was found lying on its side with its load of
scrap spread across the scene. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said that upon closer
inspection, paramedics discovered the bodies of two men lying trapped inside
the taxi. "Unfortunately, both men had already succumbed to
their numerous injuries. Nothing more could be done for them and they were
declared dead. "On further inspection, paramedics found eleven
people scattered around the scene. Assessments showed that the injuries
sustained ranged from minor to moderate." He said the patients were treated for their injuries and
were thereafter transported to various hospitals for further treatment. Local authorities were on the scene for further
investigations.
