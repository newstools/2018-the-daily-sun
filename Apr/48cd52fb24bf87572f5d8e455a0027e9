IT LOOKS as if more walls at the building where three kids were killed on Monday are collapsing. Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements Uhuru Moiloa has advised people still living in the building in Doornfontein, Joburg to move out. However, residents of the rundown building said they won’t move an inch. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssDvjaVX6iaAN3mLz5jC_xQZxOaM5XXZtGQOG2dQCitc_3cb2fpAETDbnHy-FA8_VDOl31J7XT57yAbJa9sOQN7Md3IBexbzZpSXteBV42NUDcyIIiFCKlE3Ms0aqStBeqBNUMdCQoj9tMtOZApK7X3z_RW66M-kBFitLUP2vy-sjfzETPoFj6GMiG6L6yUVH_We5TlgdMcGI0i8p1zyjdd4XfBFLIYO_XSTrW4NDIR3A5dP_y3xjWYUuhOYp7gvbFbelbU5RTcUx-JIbEOi7WkPFOWgQs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNQ2l3vLMbYiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

A resident who claimed to have lived in the building for three years said: “We don’t mind moving, but the owner must first bury the children. “Two of the children’s families are from KZN. The owner must help them. “We pay rent here and he is the one who must make sure that we are safe.” The tragic incident that killed three children aged three, five and 10 was reported in Daily Sun earlier this week. Close to 100 families occupy rooms in the building and Moiloa said arrangements were being made to move them.“The entire building remains in an unstable condition and poses several safety risks,” he said. “Heavy rain, illegal water and electricity connections and the overall structural state of the building make it unsafe.” It was established that the building was unsafe after emergency services were called to the scene of the tragedy. Inspectors found the building was illegally occupied and not suitable for people to live in.
