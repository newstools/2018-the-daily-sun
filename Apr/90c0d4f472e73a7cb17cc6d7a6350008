RESHAPING the future of South African football –  that is the theme of a grand plan to overhaul the broken system of football administration in the country. A national football conference has been planned for 12 May, spearheaded by former Safa referee Ace Ncobo. Ncobo has emerged as strong opposition to the current Safa administration and is hoping the planned conference can unify the football family and craft the way forward. “We have extended an invitation to Safa and hopefully they will take it in good spirit to be part of the process of reshaping the future of the country’s football,” said Ncobo at the media briefing yesterday. “Attending the conference will be club owners from various football levels, leaders from the Safa LFA’s, sponsors, player agents, associates members and other stakeholders. “We are anticipating about 1 500 delegates, representative of the entire spectrum of stakeholders of football. We will discuss issues and conduct a situation analysis of where football is at present. “And once that is done, we will break it down to various commissions, touching on specific aspects that constitute the totality of the business of football. “From those commissions we can hopefully develop a blueprint under the theme ‘reshaping the future of South African football’, because where we are is not where we want to be.” Ncobo said he would be attending the Safa special congress scheduled for 28 April. The football association has called the extraordinary congress to ratify its statutes on the electoral code with a view to pave the way for the elective conference on 19 May. But Ncobo has expressed reservation about the move to adopt resolution to have the elective conference. He said: “We will see what transpires at the special congress. If we win the battle to have a secret ballot there will not be an elective conference on 19 May.”
