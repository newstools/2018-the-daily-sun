COPS arrived in their numbers and raided shacks before bulldozing them and making a huge bonfire. After that residents gathered around, not in protest but to cheer the cops on! After all, the men in blue had just helped rid their kasi of dangerous nyaope junkies. Residents of Tshepisong West – better known as Ebumnandini – in Krugersdorp, Mogale City, were happy to see the police. They said they’re tired of the drug addicts who roam the streets, steal and make their lives difficult. The area is crawling so many things of disagreeable characters that locals have started calling it “Nyaopeville”. But residents’ pleas were finally answered when shacks belonging to the drug addicts were bulldozed. Cops searched for drugs, weapons and other illegal items. A resident said when cops were done disciplining the junkies, locals breathed a sigh of relief. Kagiso cops spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya said: “Kagiso police spent the better part of the day transforming Tshepisong into a better area. “They also visited the shopping centre in Chamdor, as well as factories. “They distributed pamphlets and engaged with the public, before heading to the most problematic areas.” The sometimes aggressive junkies that had been loafing around scattered in all directions and ran for dear life. No one was arrested.
