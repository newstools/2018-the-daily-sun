A week later than they would have preferred Manchester City were crowned Premier League champions on Sunday as second-placed Manchester United suffered a shock 1-0 home defeat by bottom club West Bromwich Albion.United had to at least draw to keep the title race mathematically alive but they were stunned at Old Trafford when Jay Rodriguez headed home after the break.City manager Pep Guardiola might have missed one of the proudest moments of his career, however, after admitting on Saturday that he had a round of golf booked with his son and was not planning to watch United's game.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvklIN0EOsAaaCQek7ZhL3YqiNgkWLiKFMKuMvrJTYav_cpMlYYBOePDlB3e89yvgSDsV5PL3u5TO2Td8_wv25IhrNNFr3G8uIwGX1VmCdC-kVvj6dWXEwLfUMdUT3iQ36sa3EMUxokzMWkVqVUD5w8L_cVvFUyfiVM6j6EPDngNDm4CHJb-Q4HVTQyiux64ou3-cnicYCMhRUFKTdtCbmp__WMNvEpVnRu1Ord84lgTLCo_xAmLsbikuSKnH9GWu0P33Pl3GYlgxqUqQ7S\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKJPDMVZ-Z4VEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

"We have spent a lot of money to have these amazing players, to make that possible."These players deserve all my respect because they have been unbelievable all season."Winning the Premier League is going to be one of the best three seasons I have ever had as a player and as a manager."City skipper Vincent Kompany has now won three Premier League titles since joining 10 years ago.Only former Chelsea skipper John Terry and Manchester United's former captain Roy Keane can match that."Champions!!!!!! What a great feeling!! So happy to be able to share another trophy with our amazing fans," the 32-year-old Belgian defender said on Twitter.
