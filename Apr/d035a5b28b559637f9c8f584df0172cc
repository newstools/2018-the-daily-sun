AFTER working as cocktail bartenders, two kasi youngsters decided to start their own business and use their experience. Mthandeni Dube (26) and Mandlenkosi Mncube (25) formed a company called Broken Spirits last year. They offer a “mobile bar service” around Khayelitsha and other kasis. “When people hold their parties, weddings and birthdays they call us to mix their cocktails,” said Mthandeni. The two young businessmen told the People’s Paper that they worked at the Waterfront for more than two years before deciding to start a mobile bar. “Lots of people love cocktails but they don’t know how to make them. We decided to make cocktails for people in the comfort of their own homes,” said Mthandeni. He said they are still considering having a physical cocktail bar but for now they just use their mobile bar. “We get calls from clients who tell us where they want us to be and then we get there. We mostly work at weddings, graduations and birthday parties.” When they started they focused mainly on alcoholic drinks but then decided to expand the business to include milkshakes and juices. They work through social media and the majority of their clients are referrals.
