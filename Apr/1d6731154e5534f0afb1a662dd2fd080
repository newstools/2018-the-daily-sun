 IT IS not easy to get your hands on hidden treasure. You have to know how to speak to ghosts properly. Sangoma Selina Nkosi from Ermelo, Mpumalanga, said she helps people find buried treasure. But Selina (70) warned treasure hunters that the road to riches is not that easy. “You have to be pure, abstain from sex, not eat meat, and you may not have blood on your hands, meaning you may not have killed anyone or anything. “ I use special prayers and muthi to speak to ghosts. Once I soften them up, they won’t harm us but allow me to go with the loot.” The sangoma said she has unearthed hundreds of Krugerrands, gold bars and other treasures hidden in Ermelo and other parts of Mzansi. “People come to me, telling me their ancestors have shown them where treasure is hidden.” She said before they go to look for treasure, she first throws the bones to assess the situation. “Some places are dangerous and you have to perform rituals to ensure everyone will be safe and return.” Client Isaac Nkabinde told Daily Sun his madala, who died years ago, visited him in his dreams and gave him clues to a hidden treasure. “We went with gogo and retrieved it,” he said. Jerry Mosotho said the gogo also helped him get his loot. But there’s a catch . . . Gogo’s clients usually give a little to her.
