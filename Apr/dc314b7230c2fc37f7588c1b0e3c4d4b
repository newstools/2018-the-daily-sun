A 41-year-old Polokwane businessman, Long-run Tang appeared in the Polokwane Magistrate's Court on charges of bribery. HAWKS  spokesperson Captain Marimba Maluleke said the Department of Labour allegedly conducted an inspection at the shop owned by the businessman at China City in Polokwane. He was found to be in contravention of the Labour Act, in which a compliance order was then issued. According to Maluleke, instead of complying, the businessman allegedly approached the inspector from the department and promised to give him a R3000 bribe in order to forge the compliance report. Maluleke Said  the officer from the Department of Labour alerted the Hawks Serious Corruption Investigation Unit, who then conducted a trap operation that resulted in the arrest of the suspect on 20 April, immediately after paying out the R3000 bribe to the officer. He was granted bail of R2000 and he will appear in court again on 7 June.
