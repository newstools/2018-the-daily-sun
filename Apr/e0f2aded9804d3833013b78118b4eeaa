YOU only need your hands to defend yourself in a bad situation. Sensei Jackson Mabuza believes one must be able to disarm anyone trying to harm you by using karate techniques. Sensei Jackson and his students from Tsakane go around Ekurhuleni to present workshops and hold self-defence lessons. Over the weekend, Jackson and his student Bathabile Kokong (16) demonstrated their skills to a group of women attending the Dancing Heels event with breast cancer survivors in Tsakane. The women were given tips on how to defend themselves at home and on the streets. “Women are vulnerable and some men take advantage of this. “That is why learning karate skills can help them tremendously. “Those who get involved in martial arts reap many benefits in several areas of life. “The advantage of karate is that it teaches self-discipline and equips you with fitness and strength. It is also very healthy.” Jackson said he has been practising karate his whole life. I like to share what I’ve learnt with others. “My audience was willing to learn. “I loved extending my hand to help women by demonstrating self-defence techniques and promoting the sport,” said Jackson. Anyone who would like to learn karate from sensei Jackson can visit Buhlebemfundo Secondary School at Tsakane on Monday or Tuesday from 5pm to 6pm.
