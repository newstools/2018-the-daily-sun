THULANI Ngobeni refuses to let unemployment stand in his way of success. Two years ago he chanced upon a plan to fight poverty when he saw a gap for a small business. Not only did he start his shoe business, but it was also part of a recycling effort. Thulani spends very little to produce his durable shoes that are not only comfortable, but strong too. This is because they are made out of car tyres. The 32-year-old from Dobsonville in Soweto gives new life to old tyres by turning them into shoes. “Every time I see an abandoned tyre I see business. My small creation has made me look at life differently since I started doing this. “Every time I see people burning tyres, my heart becomes sour because that could have made pairs of shoes. “My business is rare around this area. People have to go far to get exactly what I make. “I want to see my business blossoming,” said Thulani He sells his shoes from his home and at exhibitions whenever he is invited. Thulani designs shoes for women and gents and young and old can wear his shoes. He also designs shoes for special occasions on order, as well as for cultural events and weddings.
