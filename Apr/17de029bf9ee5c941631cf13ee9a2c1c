LIMPOPO cops have stopped vehicles from being smuggled across the border between South Africa and Zimbabwe. They recently got a tip-off that sports utility vehicles are being smuggled through the Limpopo River. The police found a blue BMW X3 in the middle of the river on Wednesday. Cartons of illegal cigarettes were also found, ready to be delivered. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe of Limpopo police praised the intelligence-driven operation which consisted of Musina police and the police. Following up on information led to the discovery of the vehicle in the river. “When they saw the police, the suspects abandoned the vehicle and fled to the other side of the river. The vehicle was then towed back to South Africa.” Ngoepe says the operation was expanded to other areas of Musina after information came in that cigarette smugglers were using three vehicles. “One of the vehicles sped off from the Baobab tollgate and was found abandoned along the Waterpoort road, after an intense car chase. “The other vehicle was cornered at Sebayeng in Mankweng, near Polokwane,” he said. A suspect (38) was bust in connection with the confiscated illegal cigarettes. A VW Polo, Toyota Etios, 8 831 Pacific Blue cigarettes boxes and 714 cartons of illegal cigarettes with an estimated value of R158 215 were seized during the operation. Ngoepe says the bust suspect will appear in the Mankweng Magistrates Court soon. Anyone with information must please call Brigadier James Espach at 082 576 0743, or their nearest cop station.
