THE Economic Freedom fighters (EFF) has condemned the 'white
racists' who created and paraded a statue of Gauteng MEC of Education Panyaza
Lesufi in Tshwane on Wednesday. "These racists, in an
effort to oppose the transformation of Afrikaans schools, used this effigy not
only to insult the humanity of Panyaza Lesufi but also of all black
people," EFF National Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said. The statue was in the end "hanged" on a tree to evoke
the lynching of black people, mainly by the Ku Klux Klan, that was popular in
the South of America. Ndlozi  said there is nothing
white people can do anymore to defend “white only” spaces particularly in
education. He said as a country we shall never allow anymore for any language
to be used as a tool to exclude black people from education. "MEC Lesufi has attested to the fact that he receives threats
from racists, who also threaten his children. "We call on the SAPS not only to follow up these threats but
to make arrests and prosecute these people for a good example to be set. These
racist white men are a menace to our democratic order. They belong in jail,
behind bars, where criminals like them are kept," Ndlozi said. Ndlozi  said no one must go
around threatening public servants for doing what is a constitutionally charged
mandate. "A white racist must meet the full might of the law and not
threaten black peoples with impunity."
