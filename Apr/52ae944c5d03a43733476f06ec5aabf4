VUYANI Jarana, the new SAA CEO appeared before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts regarding irregular and fruitful expenditure. SAA was presenting its annual report and financial statement for 2016/17. According to the Auditor General’s report, irregular expenditure is at about R126 million and fruitless and wasteful expenditure is at R40 million. Jarana, who joined SAA in November, said the airline has an outstanding debt of R9 billion that is due in March.  He said the R10 billion that was injected by government last year was used to pay a R7,6 billion debt. Only R2,4 billion was used to support working capital requirements. The committee was not happy when Jarana and his team failed to provide the latest information about investigations into fruitless expenditure and some contracts that are not useful to the airline. Some MPs said SAA failed to provide adequate reports on the progress of investigations into fruitless and irregular expenditure. “We want information. We are ready to read it even if you give us a box full of reports. “We don’t want generalities, we want specifics,” said chairman Themba Godi. SAA’s board chairman Johannes Magwaza told MPs they appointed a forensic group made up of board members to look into the current investigations. Jarana told MPs that he is trying to build a team that will turn around the national carrier but he needs more time. Jarana said technology was one of their goals.
