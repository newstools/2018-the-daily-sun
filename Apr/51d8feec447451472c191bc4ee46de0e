Angry that his girlfriend might have rented her room out to lovers, Mbalekwa Sindane (42) angrily knocked on the door. He said for a moment the people seemed to have stopped but only to continue seconds later.

The trainee pastor from Refilwe in Cullinan, east of Tshwane, said he called out to his girlfriend and the next thing the man came out. “He started to beat me with everything he could lay his hands on while my girlfriend waited in bed for him,” he said. Mbalekwa said the man then went back to the room while he lay screaming for help. “I passed out and woke up in hospital after the attack on 27 December. I was discharged and went straight to the police station to open a case. I want him to rot in jail for beating me,” he said.To his dismay, the man has never been arrested. “I see him every day. He is a free man. I want the police to do their job and arrest him,” he said. He said despite what happened, he still loved his girlfriend.He said he wants to marry his girlfriend so she will end the relationship with his attacker. “If he gets arrested, he will be released to find us living happily ever,” he said. Cullinan police spokeswoman Constable Connie Moganedi said a case of common assault was opened. She advised Mbalekwa to visit their station if he is not happy with the progress of the case.
