It’s hard. I’m not even sure if I’ll be able to write my mid-year exams,” she said.“My teachers told me if the gender mistake wasn’t fixed, it would affect my matric certificate.” Her mum, Molabane (46), told Daily Sun that she did all she could to resolve the mistake but had no success.Molabane blamed Home Affairs officials in Mokopane for failing to help her daughter. “I have visited that office several times but couldn’t get help. I have given up.”Thabo Mokgola, a spokesman for Home Affairs, said: “The matter has been referred to the relevant department at head office for investigation.”Molabane confirmed that Home Affairs officials from Polokwane have contacted her to resolve the matter.
