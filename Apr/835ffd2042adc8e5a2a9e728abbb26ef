compared to the 2016/17 financial year. "Revenue collection is driven by the state of
the economy, the fiscal policy choices, administrative efficiency and taxpayer
compliance or tax morality. "As much as the performance of any tax
administration is premised on the economy, other key determinants are business
and consumer confidence, tax morality and the credibility of the tax
administration," SARS said.According to SARS the 2017/18 financial year was
characterised by distinct and clearly delineated growth patterns. Until
December 2017, revenue in aggregate grew by 6.2% year on year. However, SARS said the stronger currency towards
the latter part of 2017 assisted companies with imports, which benefitted our
trade taxes.The main sources of revenue that contributed to the
R1216.6bn were Personal Income Tax (PIT), Value-Added Tax (VAT) and Company
Income Tax (CIT).Despite this decline in compliance, most taxpayers
continue to perform their tax obligations diligently.
