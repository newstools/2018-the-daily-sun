TEAM South Africa's 4x100m men's relay quartet will be without star 200m runner Clarence Munyai for their final at the Commonwealth Games on Saturday.Munyai stormed to a new SA record in the 200m at last month's SA National Championship, posting 19.69 - making him the 10th fastest runner of all time over the distance.However, in Thursday's 200m final on Australia's Gold Coast, Munyai disappointed in finishing fifth in a pedestrian-by-comparison time of 20.58, before being upgraded to fourth following the disqualification of 'winner', England's Zharnel Hughes.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvNweSwX4wGPl8MlssKYFicqNEjq8e532o9jaglgL9zzOJYB77q9CTF-k9jG4hJxk-9XwyW45BBI39eSgN7yY9nfLqDL6tlKafQ5t2x-BRphvdxs9sGy8rMTOYqCTd9wrolvw6jNP4-OZCjNtMItWgoPGkSet0ybdOPnPcVFEgQTSTqsvYmkmeHxmwwjYApHBq9Hk-oURQ--DL4zW6qtZQ0yzbhVotFgk0f3pEz73Q0gFs6JEvPQvlY3T8QEp8a23XgpR8hChR3m5PPWk6eKA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzB4yoRQkTOuBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I knew it was going to tough challenge even before I got to settle in the starting blocks. Unfortunately, the hamstring injury that hindered me in the heats flared up again. It was quite painful when I raced. I am confident that it is not something serious, but I think it would be wise to take a two-week break,” said the Tuks sprinter.In Friday's 4x100m heats, South Africa, in the form of Commonwealth Games 100m silver medallist Henricho Bruintjies, Emile Erasmus, Anaso Jobodwana and 100m gold medallist Akani Simbine won the first of the two heats in 38.71 to progress to the final.The time proved to be fourth-quickest overall, after England (38.15), Jamaica (38.44) and Nigeria (38.52) all posted faster times in the second heat.The final of the 4x100m relay will take place at 06:40 (SA time) on Saturday.
