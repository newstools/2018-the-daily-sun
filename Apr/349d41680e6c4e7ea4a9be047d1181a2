village, the car drove straight into the nearby bushes.The deceased's legs were then tied against a tree and was
left alone. "In the evening , the accused returned to that spot
,attacked the deceased ,broke her arm, cut off her body parts before killing
her," said Ngoepe.Ngoepe said following the Police's intensive
investigations ,the accused was later arrested with three other suspects who
were later released on R5000 bail each. The trio, Nkhensani Christina Mhlongo (52), Solomon
Mngengeni Mahumani (53) and Amos Mafemani Chuma (45) are still expected to meet
the same fate when they appear in the same court on 2 May. The Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke
Ledwaba has welcomed the long jail term and also commended the Giyani  Detectives on the job well done."We hope that by removing this criminal from our
streets for such a long time, will serve as a deterrent to all the criminals
out there and our communities will also stay peacefully," he said.Ledwaba said all the criminals who are still engaged in
any form of criminal activities especially crimes against women, will be dealt
with mercilessly and without compromise.
