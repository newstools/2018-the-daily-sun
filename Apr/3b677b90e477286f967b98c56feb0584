He said the people needed protection. “We want to ensure them we will support them through everything.”Siwela said those who targeted people with albinism were cruel. “If they want money, they should go and work. “There are no short cuts to wealth and power. “We want to get rid of the myth that albinos are different.” He said a bigger march would be organised in the province soon.One of the marchers said living with albinism is scary as she has to watch her back all the time.
