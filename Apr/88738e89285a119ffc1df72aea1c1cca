Mathematically, they all stand a chance of finishing second, but Lidoda Duvha and Ezenkosi, who occupy second (44 points) and third spot (42) respectively, are hot favourites.Cosmos ended Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila’s hopes of finishing in the top three on Sunday when they thrashed them 3-1 at Vosloorus Stadium. But Sono was left unimpressed by his players’ performance despite the victory. Said the coach: “Our attitude is wrong. When it’s 3-0 some players think they are on holiday and start showboating. “If the score is like that and there’s a chance, they must score even more goals.”Sono believes the play-offs race is still wide open. “Four games, it’s a lot. The remaining games can change everything. We still have a lot of work to do,” he said.Real Kings, who are in their second season in the NFD, are in fourth position with 40 points and won’t throw in the towel until the final match has been played.
