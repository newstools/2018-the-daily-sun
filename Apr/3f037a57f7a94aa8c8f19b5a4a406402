Black Twitter is not a fan of Mmusi Maimane, and Maimane is not really helping the situation. On Friday at a Freedom Day rally in Soshanguve Pretoria, the DA leader told the gathering crowd that people on Twitter and Facebook call him Mini-Mandela. And that statement by Maimane had a lot of people in all sorts of feels. Tweeps came out to defend themselves, asking who amongst them called Mmusi Maimane a Mini-Mandela. People did not hold back. Others suggested that like Mandela, Mmusi should go away for 27 years! Others on Twitter said that Mmusi is really a Mini-Mandela, referencing the sentiments many South Africans had after watching the documentary ‘Winnie’. After the airing of the documentary many South Africans labelled Mandela a sellout, claiming that he sold Mam’Winnie Madikizela-Mandela out, and Mmusi ‘Dumela Bagaetsho’ Maimane is also a sellout. Mmusi Maimane has been long labelled as a sell out on Black Twitter, many claiming he is merely a front to lure black people into what is a “white party”.
