A YOUNG mum is devastated after her baby died in her arms at Pholosong Hospital in Ekurhuleni. Nokuthula Majola (22), from KwaThema in Springs, gave birth to a healthy baby girl on 10 April. On 13 April she took the child, Luthando, for a check-up. Nurses noticed the baby had severe jaundice and called an ambulance to rush her to Pholosong Hospital. “We arrived at about 12.15pm,” said Nokuthula. “They took us to a waiting room where we sat for hours before we received any help. I asked for help after noticing that Luthando’s eyes had rolled back, but the nurses shouted at me. “They said I shouldn’t ask for special attention.” Moments later, the terrified mum noticed her baby had stopped breathing. “I called the nurses to do a check-up. This was two hours after we got there. “A doctor said they were not made aware of Luthando’s condition. “The nurses came back and told me my child had died. “I asked to see my baby, but they said they had taken her to the mortuary.” The incident happened at the weekend and Nokuthula was told to return on Monday. “When I went back, they told me a post mortem had to be done and the police had to open a case. “When I went back the following day, I was told the same thing. “They had the nerve to give us poor service after my baby died in a hospital.” Health spokesman Lesemang Matuka said the department had investigated the allegations. He said the nurses and doctors involved were instructed to complete patient safety incident forms. The hospital promised to improve waiting times in the casualty department.
