WITHIN 30 minutes of the online application going live, 30 000 parents applied for admission next year for their grade 1 and grade 8 kids.  That’s when the Gauteng Education Department’s call centre started receiving 400 calls every 10 minutes. By the time MEC Panyaza Lesufi arrived at Atteridgeville Community Hall in Tshwane to take the online application system for admissions in 2019 live, parents were already waiting. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>He then helped them apply for admission. Carrying her proof of residence and her child’s birth certificate and other documents, Khensani Chauke (26) beamed with pride as the MEC helped her apply for her daughter, who is going to grade 1 next year. Khensani said she woke up very early because her friends told her registering through the new system takes time. But she never thought she would be assisted by the MEC.“I hope I have not embarrassed myself in front of him,” she said.“Within 10 minutes, he was finished with my application and I received an SMS.” She said she was happy that Lesufi explained everything to her and made her check the information she provided before submitting the application. “The MEC should work with officials who will help people to apply. He is friendly and makes everything look easy. “I think my friends spent more time applying because he was not there,” she said. Parent Makoena Senyatsi (24) said the system has improved. “This year the system is quick. I applied for my six-year-old son on my phone in less than eight minutes,” she said. Lesufi said the online application process is very important as it helps the department in its planning. He said the system doesn’t discriminate and provides information about people’s applications. “Gauteng is attracting many people. We need to know how many teachers and classrooms we’ll need next year and this system helps us with that. “Ninety seven percent of parents choosing the public school system shows we’re doing things right,” said the MEC.
