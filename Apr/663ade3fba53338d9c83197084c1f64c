Vernon Philander grabbed six wickets in a devastating spell of swing bowling as South Africa crushed Australia by a record 492 runs to clinch the four-match series 3-1 at the Wanderers on Tuesday.The scandal-hit tourists had promised to fight for a draw on the final day to end a controversial tour on a positive note but their resistance lasted just 83 minutes as Philander ripped through their middle and lower order to finish with career-best figures of 6-21 and move to 204 test wickets.Australia were bowled out for a paltry 119 in their second innings to succumb to their heaviest ever loss to South Africa in terms of runs, their second biggest defeat against any opponent and the fourth biggest loss in test cricket.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvVtDAKVGq0cyny6v44wvLi2ujcOH5Qo_zZRLXhUwIv8dMOMEohhwdPK6RIyC-BbKg9a2pHe2ylo05a97371M4H7V07soqEE-4_zIjArxt0DfR5I9XcObInXk6t1NIQDhGpTq7pCUS275MIGccU_O9QS0HHnizyZAcOniMEOqzxkC7XvhZuL4tP-o7tPSNRzHaGcVEKPmDXV0boD7Nn02iAGXWpvBvYj9-pSOSuJcDM3Xtgq5VPgJLcnKPYepOLi4eGe-MrOoyn_SqLtP_r\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDX0ypINIVx_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
