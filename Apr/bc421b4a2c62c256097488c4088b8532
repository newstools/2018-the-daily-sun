He said the dead had wounds all over their bodies. The makoti’s mother-in-law, Christina Genuka (62) said: “My son went to get his wife back but was told she was not there.Two months ago men went to ask for the lobola to be returned and five cows were sent,” she said. She appealed for the fighting to stop. The dead are Lindani Nongqayi, Nzukiso Mayaba, Mlandeli Ngundze, Tholakele Juqula and Zesipho Mazongolo.Zesipho’s father, Perriena Mazongolo, said he was shattered.Eastern Cape MEC for sport, arts and recreation Pemmy Majodina said: “Infighting does not assist anyone. We cannot promote revenge attacks.” She said social workers would visit the families today. “A meeting between the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders and other stakeholders will be held soon,” she said. Mtukushe said cops are monitoring the villages.
