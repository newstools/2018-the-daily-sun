He requested anyone with a missing relative to come forward so DNA samples can be taken for testing. “The samples from both the head and body will be taken for DNA tests to confirm if they match,” he said.Resident Nduduzo Mnguni (37) said everyone in the village was shocked.He said he wasn’t there when the head was found because he doesn’t live near the field.“But what’s strange is that there is no information about a missing person in this village. So chances are that the poor woman was dumped here.” Nduduzo said he was hopeful cops would reveal the mystery behind the death. “We hope her family will be found so she can be buried with dignity.”
