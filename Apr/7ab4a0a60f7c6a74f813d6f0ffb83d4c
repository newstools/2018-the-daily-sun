Another petrol price increase is expected to hit South African motorists hard at the end of April.This is according
to the unaudited mid-month data released by the Central Energy Fund.The Automobile Association said Petroleum prices were
largely flat in the first week of April, but spiked sharply as tensions
escalated in Syria.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The Middle East lies near many of the world's key oil
producers, and petroleum prices have historically been sensitive to instability
in the regionThe Rand also weakened slightly against the US dollar in
the first half of April, but the AA points out that the spike in international
petroleum prices accounts for nearly the entire rise in fuel prices predicted
by the mid-month data.In all of these increases, the movement in the exchange
rate accounts for just four cents of the rise. The predicted increase in May comes on the back of a 72
cents increase in April meaning, if it materialises, that fuel prices will have
increased by more than one Rand in the space of two months."The prolonged instability in the Middle East could
drive international petroleum prices higher."Several foreign powers have now taken a position in the
Syrian civil war. "If tensions escalate, or the war itself drags out even
further, the outlook for oil prices would become more negative. South Africans
should be aware that their fuel budgets might come under renewed strain in the
short to medium term," AA said.
