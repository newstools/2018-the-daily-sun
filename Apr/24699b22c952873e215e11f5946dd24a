AJAX Cape Town coach Muhsin Ertugral has admitted that he is a broken man.  He has five matches left to try and save the Urban Warriors from being relegated from the Absa Premiership after Tuesday’s 2-1 defeat to AmaZulu in Durban.Things are getting messier for Turkish-born mentor, who assured club supporters that he would save their team from relegation when he returned for his fourth stint with the club in December last year. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss1jZJ2P573fS3soSawfhOo1A-ELqNF0KSxvxpq6kYK50Zbrtu_6S5tZQpmyQjsPWtbJhf5gLY_BY7lPXqHVBuOuSzspKXgoHnKMuBkcRacNA_Dlrr2ivu3R5P_7QXGbRlna2Ff9_qS5MlY_5y_-w40kPYFlrjsnOBtJvyZvRx0VBg4C2l4abSPir1GmqqCHtZL_sJ_hMaoiBxUEa81bsxJvV3aDK5sMHZ-ge2p3tkTI8sDLCIF8XBstgFKKIuipUg010_Has0Cu6sejsuuaeXp9Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzC6ghPOexmyvEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Our away run has left a lot to be desired this season. We have yet to win on the road and that has been our downfall. “It worries me. We have let ourselves down in a number of matches we played away. Against AmaZulu we did the same thing. We have no one to blame but ourselves in this match. We lacked that killer instinct. “We definitely need to change our ways in these last matches.” Ajax are holders of the worst away record after 13 matches. They have collected just two points and zero victories so far on the road – their defeat to Usuthu was their 10th. Fellow relegation candidates Platinum Stars are second on the list from the same number of matches as Ajax. They have won three, drawn five and lost five others away.Ertugral has, however, targeted at least three wins in these last five games. He has urged his players to pull up their socks and show the same hunger in their away matches as they always do at home, where they have won all six of their matches.“I don’t understand why they are nervous when playing away. They do everything right, create scoring chances, but the final product is always a problem,” said Ertugral.“I want them to show the same killer instinct they always show when they are playing at home. They are relaxed at home. “We have five matches left and I’m looking to at least win three to survive,” added the coach.But bookmakers will not put their money on Ajax dodging the axe, as they have the worst five opponents remaining – with Kaizer Chiefs, Bidvest Wits and Chippa United in the mix. It would take a miracle for Ajax to bag another nine points.
