We only found his clothes and began searching for him. “The police joined the search, but his body has not yet been found. We believe he was swept out to sea.”Nqubeko’s mum Busi Ndebele (35) told Daily Sun: “Losing a child is devastating. He was the first-born child.”She said there was an area they could not get to on foot, and if police could search by helicopter her son’s body would be recovered. She said police divers temporarily called off their search on two occasions.Ward Councillor Sandile Xulu confirmed that villagers wake up early and go to the river to search for the teenager, who is presumed dead.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said police divers will request a helicopter if they thought it would help.
