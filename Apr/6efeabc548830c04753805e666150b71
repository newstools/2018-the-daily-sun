A FAMILY’S worst nightmare came true when the body of their 12-year-old relative was found hanging from a tree. The incident happened in Ozwathini, north of Durban, on Thursday. Now the family has a bone to pick with the police. Thabiso Mchunu’s family said police must close their inquest docket and treat the case as a murder. Thami’s aunt, Bizeni Nxumalo (62), said the family was convinced the boy didn’t kill himself. “We all rushed to the scene and found Thami dead. But when we got closer, we suspected he might have been murdered because the rope wasn’t tight. There were no bruises on his neck to indicate he had hanged himself. We want police to open a murder case,” said Bizeni She said Thami, who was a grade 7 pupil at Ozwathini Primary School, had been playing with four friends when a schoolmate fetched him. She said Thami’s friends told the family the schoolmate promised to return but never did. Bizeni said the family wanted police to question the boy who disappeared with Thami. She said they were not happy that cops didn’t look for the boy when the family asked them to do so. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, said: “Ndwedwe police have opened an inquest docket. “It it could be changed to murder if the post mortem results indicate the boy was killed.”
