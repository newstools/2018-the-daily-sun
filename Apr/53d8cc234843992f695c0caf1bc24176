PITSO MOSIMANE has thrown the cat among pigeons with his controversial thought-provoking comments on the criteria for the PSL Coach of the Season award. Although it has been a generally accepted trend that the league-winning coach cannot be beaten to the award, the Mamelodi Sundowns coach has tipped Fadlu Davids to bag the accolade, arguing that the youthful coach has done enough in his debut season to impress the football public.Could there be merit to Mosimane’s argument or is he just stirring controversy as usual?if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssPFADABPapuMihPzZrL93ZBN-YPySDF5bpuJDho4phnXVMizvT4X1KIO7EJZInhIKmEkJO8tlSnNJvOgI4FhoExz4BQ66AwBW-MZDx4BB8U3V7HPLn_v3dNHCze4o_WtBfJduD3izYa0Z-9cBoEPVmTbuIJ2dpT6R5cdES2hgu1rL9bafZMS5fOUqCnc1DDMjtudGKoSQ0O7GF4UxgchKSYhZpwpHZ9r0MvEsYsYJNEepQGcO6VWRc6p1PeOIiNbpMumQ71s0UK7yV9pwS6xBKX7U\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCmqdeKH6xN8EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Whether or not he claims silverware, Davids will emerge from this season with an enhanced reputation. Some recognition will be due reward.Luc Eymael, Free State Stars: It says a lot about Eymael’s spell at Free State Stars that he’s already being touted as the next Kaizer Chiefs coach.Not that it’s surprising to see Stars shining brighter this season and oozing positivity.For a club which was being sold back in August, Ea Lla Koto have already exceeded expectations. Eymael didn’t inherit a team of uber-talented and ready-made winners, but took over a team put together on a shoestring budget.The Belgian culinary master has created a delicious dish despite boasting average ingredients. And not everyone can ready, steady and cook like Eymael.Benni McCarthy, Cape Town City: Like Davids, McCarthy has overachieved in his debut season, reaching a cup final and keeping City consistently in the top six.With the season nearing its business end, McCarthy is wont to blowing his own trumpet. He has certainly caught the eye his tactical acumen, having taken a winning team forward. But the lack of trophies might count against him.Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic, Orlando Pirates: Should the “soul-healing” process result in a league title for Pirates, there’ll be a strong case to be made for Micho.Micho inherited a team in tatters, and despite a slow start, the Serbian has so far done fairly well to steer the Bucs ship out of choppy waters.He hasn’t been as lucky in the knockout competitions, but he could clinch the ultimate league prize.Pitso Mosimane, Mamelodi Sundowns: In his own words, Mosimane is chasing the bigger Champions League fish, and not the local “sardines”.“How many times have I won it? Let Fadlu win it. Do I really need that? I don’t. Fadlu deserves it. Luc deserves it too,” he said.Should Sundowns win the league, though, Mosimane may well bag his third PSL Coach of the Season award.
