The Harambe hitmaker wrote: “Bathong, before you hear it from people, me and my beautiful Motho whom I love so much will not be continuing with our marriage.”He said he was caught cheating on her at the weekend of Maftown Meets Pitori. “I’m sure she would love to tell you all about it. “To my female fan base that I lose on the eve of my last album release, I truly apologise. I will miss you. To my male fan base that was inspired by our love, le tla ba strong.“Breakups are messy as people have to choose sides. My Motho is the side to stick to. I am a horrible person.”HHP’s new album Drum is due for release on 16 June. HHP later deleted the post, which raised more eyebrows. Since then, both HHP and Lerato, who have been together for 10 years, have removed photos of each other from their Instagram pages. When the SunTeam phoned him, he said: “Oh my God. I am sure you know I’m going to drop the phone on you?” Lerato couldn’t be reached at the time of going to print.
