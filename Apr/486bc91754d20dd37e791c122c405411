force the NPA to comply with the SCA order, but this leads to further appeals
from Zuma's legal team.August 18, 2014: Zuma's legal team falls apart at the SCA,
conceding that they have no argument for keeping the tapes out of the hands of
the DA. https://www.news24.com/Analysis/timeline-jacob-zuma-gets-his-day-in-court-20180406
