THESE two brothers and their friend have become SunHeroes! The three pupils, aged 12, 10 and 9, were on their way to school on Tuesday morning when they spotted a thug being chased by cops. As he fled, the thug tossed his gun into the bush near Protea Glen, Soweto. The cops did not see it, but the boys did and vowed to search for it on their way back from school. They said to their surprise, they found the gun was real and not a toy as they had first thought. “It was heavy and we could see it was a deadly weapon.” They then put the gun in a school bag and walked to the local police station. SunReader Paulina Koloti, who was at the police station at the time, said the three tossed the bag on top of the counter and rushed to the door in case it went off. “I was so impressed by what these kids had done, I immediately took their photo and their parents’ contact details. “Not many positive incidents like these get reported. “These kids deserve a reward,” Paulina said. The brothers’ mum said she is very proud of her kids. The Protea Glen cops were so impressed, they took the children home. Protea Glen police spokesman Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng chased the thug on Tuesday morning. Mashiteng said he was on his way to work when he was stopped by a woman, who told him about a thug who was robbing schoolkids. “I immediately gave chase, but the suspect disappeared between the houses. “I looked for him, but he was nowhere to be found. “I wasn’t even aware that the thug had tossed his gun away until the boys brought it in that afternoon. “We appreciate these kids for the good work they have done,” he said. Mashiteng said police are still looking for the suspect. Anyone with information can contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
