He was struck off the roll of attorneys by the Limpopo High Court in 2010 for embezzling money from the Road Accident Fund (RAF) trust fund. But it emerged that the 46-year-old former attorney is at it again. He is still claiming money from RAF. He was arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation Unit on Wednesday. HAWKS spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said cops received a tip off that the suspect continued to claim money from RAF on behalf of the beneficiaries even after he was struck of the roll. Maluleke said investigations revealed that the suspect used his personal bank account to claim money from RAF and he did not pay the beneficiaries, this resulted in him personally unduly benefiting over a million rand. The suspect, who was a practicing in Thohoyandou is expected to appear before the Louis Trichardt Magistrate’s Court  on Thursday, to face charges relating to fraud and impersonating an attorney.
