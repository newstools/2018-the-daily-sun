GET rid of the rubbish! That is the call by angry Bergman residents in Mangaung, Free State, who want the municipality to remove the rubbish piled up next to their yards. Tebello Nkopane (42) said they have lived with the problem for years and it seems no one is willing to help them. “We can’t open the windows because of the smell,” he said. “People use the area as a dumping site. They even dumped dead dogs and a cat. “I tried to stop them, but they told me it wasn’t my business.” He said the municipality removed some people, claiming they were going to build a park on the land, but there is no park. “Maybe the rubbish is the park they promised us. “Our kids go there and play with dangerous needles, used nappies and condoms. “We reported it to our councillor and she always promises to clean it, but nothing has happened. We can’t live like this.” Matlakala Mosese (34) said: “We live in fear as thugs hide there, waiting to rob people coming from work. We have lived with this rubbish a long time. “We are tired of the councillor and empty promises. “No one can be happy living next to stinking rubbish.” Ward 17 councillor Lerato Maphathe said the dump site started in the past few years and those who reported it to Daily Sun are the ones who dump there. “It will be solved soon, as I reported it to the municipality.” Municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said the matter will be attended to shortly.
