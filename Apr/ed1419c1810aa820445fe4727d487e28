In the letters, the residents asked to occupy the land.The letters are dated from 2016 until this year and municipal stamps proved the City had received them.April Matlou (60) said all he wanted was for his children and grandchildren to have a place to lay their heads.“We don’t want RDPs. All we want is a piece of land so we can build shacks and houses.“We’re spending too much money on rent. We could have used that money to build houses for our families,” said April.Maria Mbekwa (53) said she had been renting a room with her children for 15 years. She said they had no peace or privacy.“My children need their space. Some just leave the house to stay with their boyfriends because we don’t have space in the room,” she said.“We’re not asking for water, electricity and roads yet. All we want is land where we can live with our children.”MMC for human settlements in Ekurhuleni, Lesiba Mpya, said there were plans in place for the community.“The piece of land has been bought so that development can take place,” said Mpya.“All we ask is that they be patient as the development of RDPs in that area has been approved.“R102 million has already been invested towards the project. “The only thing that’s left is the approved of the builder.“Close to 3 566 units will be built.”
