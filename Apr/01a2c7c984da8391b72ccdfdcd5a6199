FIVE employees of a cash delivery company have been arrested
in connection with a cash-in-transit heist earlier this month. The men, aged between 30 and 48, were arrested for their
role in a heist on April 13 during which R30m was stolen. Spokesperson for the Hawks in Gauteng Captain Ndivhuwo
Mulamu said the arrests were the result of an investigation by the Hawks'
National Bureau of Illegal Firearms Control and Priority Violent Crime. On April 13, the gang targeted an armoured cash vehicle
which had left a depot in Spartan, east of Johannesburg, en route to Selby. But
before it got to its destination, the vehicle stopped in Kensington. The armoured vehicle was opened from the back and three men
took money bags from it and fled with about R30m in cash. "The guards then drove away only to alert the employer
about the 'robbery' a few kilometres away from the scene. They were
subsequently found unconscious and taken to a nearby hospital for treatment
where it was established that they apparently drank soft drinks spiked with an
unknown substance," Mulamu said. She said the five people who were arrested were Nkosinathi
Feni, 48, Gabriel Mbhango, 35, Siphiwe Hlungwane, 45, Bavuyise Ndaba, 30, and
Petros Ndlovu, 38. Their case had been postponed until next Monday for further
investigation. Police are still looking for four other suspects, one of whom
was the driver of the armoured vehicle. Gauteng Hawks head Major General Prince Mokotedi has
applauded the arrests, however, he expressed concern at the high number of
heists. "The spate of cash-in-transit heists is a cause for
concern. Our members will work around the clock to make sure that outstanding
suspects are brought to book including the stolen money," Mokotedi said. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/gauteng-hawks-arrest-5-security-company-workers-for-r30m-heist-20180424
