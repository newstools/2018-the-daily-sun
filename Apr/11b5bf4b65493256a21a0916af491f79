It appears retired Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates star Sibusiso “Rhee” Zuma is sick and tired of thugs trying to ruin his life. The former FC Copenhagen striker told Sunday Sun this week that he’s been trying desperately to tackle a scamster, who has been using his name to swindle his close friends and relatives of cash. He said he was hopping mad on his way to the Midrand Police Station, north of Jozi, to try and stop an unknown male who has already gained access to R60 000 of a former footie’s friends. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>“My friend called me to verify and I told him he shouldn’t fall for that trap.“The service provider is dragging the matter, which started about four years ago when someone pretending to be me, sent a text to my uncle borrowing R40 000, saying I was in trouble,” he said. Sibusiso said he suspects the person works in the bank and has managed to gain access to his personal information. “He started by taking 40k from my uncle, lied and pretended to be me in trouble. My uncle panicked and deposited the cash,” he said. “It doesn’t end there, the following year the same thing happened when the fraudster pretended to be me and asked one of my contacts for cash,” he said. Sibusiso also said the latest stunt pulled by the scamster was when he tried to get R50 000 from his uncle. “I hope the police will get to the bottom of this because it’s affecting my life, and putting people I care about in danger,” he said. Midrand police confirmed that Zuma had opened a case of fraud.
