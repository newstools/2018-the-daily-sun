The City of Cape Town's disaster risk management centre has
been placed on alert after the South African Weather Service issued an advisory
warning of localised flooding on Monday evening. Disaster risk management spokesperson Charlotte Powell said
a cold front was expected to make landfall late in the afternoon. Rainfall of 5mm to 20mm could be expected, with 20-35mm over
the western mountains, she said. "Rain is expected mainly for the western parts of the
Western Cape, spreading to the south coast late evening. According to the
forecast, 5-20mm can be expected for the western parts, with 25-30mm over the
mountainous areas," she said. Heavy downpours, pooling and flooding in parts of the Cape
metropole, Winelands and Overberg district were also possible, Powell warned. "Morning showers are still expected for [Tuesday],
clearing in the afternoon. A cut-off low is expected to approach from the west
on Wednesday, bringing rain for the western parts of the Western Cape in the
evening, into Thursday morning." "Heavy downpours, flooding and strong winds may be
expected in places over the Cape metropole, Winelands and Overberg district.
Minor to possibly significant impacts can be expected." The disaster risk management centre as well as other City
departments were on alert for "any incidents that may require a
response", Powell said. She advised the public to report weather-related
risks or incidents to its emergency communication centre on 107 from a landline
or 021 480 7700 from a cellphone. SOURCE: NEWS24
