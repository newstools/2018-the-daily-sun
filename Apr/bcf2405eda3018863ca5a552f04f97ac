DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane visited Danville in Mahikeng, North West on Saturday, a day after Police Minister Bheki Cele also paid a visit. Residents told both Cele and Maimane that cops had shot at them with live ammunition and used racial insults. They said they were called “bushmen” during recent protests calling for North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo to step down. Cuan Everett (18) claimed cops shot him in his mouth while he was sitting at his house with his 89-year-old gogo. Maimane said: “We are deeply concerned about the level of violence taking place here. “The community was discriminated against because of the colour of their skin. “The victims have already opened a case with Ipid and I will follow it up. Maimane said they would also open a case with the South African Human Rights Commission and raise the issue in parliament. “So many people were injured and allegations must be thoroughly investigated.” During his visit Cele told residents: “We will investigate the allegations and if we find them to be true, the necessary decisions will be taken against those who are liable. “We cannot allow the police to discriminate against our people according to the colour of their skin,” said Cele.
