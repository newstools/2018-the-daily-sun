Xolani said on Monday evening his 22-year-old sister Nosipho’s ex-boyfriend phoned her and threatened to kill the entire family. “I have heard that since my sister dumped the man, he has been refusing to accept it. When he made threats we did not take it lightly,” he said. “We left home to sleep at neighbours’ houses. In the early hours we woke up to find our home covered in flames.” Xolani said the matter was reported to the police, but the suspect was still at large. When the SunTeam asked to speak to Nosipho, Xolani said she was too shocked and traumatised. “I do not know why she dumped this man and she is currently in no condition to speak. She is hurt that this whole thing is all about her,” he said.KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed the incident and said a case of arson had been opened at the Ulundi Police Station. “No arrests have been made,” she said.
