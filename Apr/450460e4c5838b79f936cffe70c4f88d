Former president Jacob Zuma's adviser fraudster Schabir
Shaik and French arms manufacturer Thales formed a common purpose to bribe the former
president through a series of payments.  This was revealed in the 89-page indictment released by the
National Prosecuting Authority this week. 
The State said Zuma had benefited in the period of October
25, 1995, to July 2005 through 783 payments totalling R4 072 499.85. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvU21f_1hwWemS3Q9cVWMgh05Zt5M-q2o6Zi7XLgLVPKHHss1KAE6W1oJf49Y_6KlC4XBYCt8y_W_UyPqkpcSKOx_qtsOthih6khl0Mkix0JRGZ_AcDUld8SiHQHSMeeNLxXQIxoAiM-LbA6-BXZdNEtenw4i4gFTa_K5B-odFjtNut5uvFEUkU1RWflNp8uPc5v9OH9_uTnUG5qSHR7Bc6UUvb_8jDTuJ4jF8zx0Q93cGGbDEVigL5O-8ltRGvrVS37XPu9_KPIpRfjZt20Y2sshJOUPQB\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEc418oyoPHbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

corporate entities within the Nkobi group (controlled by Shaik) and/or the
other relevant corporate entities to accused one (Zuma) and various parties for
the benefit of accused one," read the indictment. Zuma appeared in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Durban on
Friday, April 6, along with his co-accused, Thales, which was represented by
Christine Guerrier. Guerrier had travelled from Paris to attend the case.  No business senseZuma as accused number one faces charges of fraud, money
laundering, corruption and racketeering. The former president had the support
of senior ANC KwaZulu-Natal and former Cabinet ministers when he appeared last
Friday. The case was postponed to June 8. The indictment says the common purpose between Zuma, Shaik
and Nkobi group was formed on or before October 25, 1995. However, the State says the scheduled payments to Zuma do
not make any legitimate business sense. It alleges that neither Shaik nor the Nkobi group could
afford the payments, as they were at all times in a "cash-starved
position" and at times relied on bank overdrafts and borrowing money from
banks at prevailing interest rates – to make the payments interest free. The State also said the group's survival depended on
obtaining profitable new business. It also said whether the loans were
affordable or not, it was not the Nkobi group's legitimate business to make
payments to Zuma or other politicians. "Even if the payments could properly be regarded as
loans, they amounted to 'benefits'," it said.  No effort to recover paymentsThe State said some of the payments, described and treated
in certain Nkobi groups as loans, was inconsistent. "The final accounting treatment of R1 137 722.48 of the
total payments of R4 072 499.85 does not reflect the payments as loans,"
it said.  The State added that the schedule payments were intended by
Shaik, the Nkobi group and Thales as bribes. "The funds were paid without security. This is not a
usual commercial practice with banks, more especially in respect of a customer
with accused one's risk profile.SOURCE: NEWS24
