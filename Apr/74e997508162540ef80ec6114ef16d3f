Nosimo said Thando started his business after finishing matric, and had lived in Marikana for four years. “We didn’t have money for him to continue his studies and that’s why he started a hardware and supermarket business.” Nosimo said Thando never told the family about any threats against him. “Those who murdered my son must know their day will come.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of murder was opened. “No arrests have been made.”
