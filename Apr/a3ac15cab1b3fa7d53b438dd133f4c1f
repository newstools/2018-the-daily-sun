 HOME Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has declared war on long queues across Mzansi. Local people and foreigners have complained about the long queues and officials’ lack of interest in their work. People are unhappy about the time they spend at the department and about having to leave without receiving assistance. Gigaba said he has heard the people and is working on the problems. Briefing the media in Tshwane yesterday, he said earlier this month he instructed the department to complete an assessment report on managing queues and how to improve their work. Gigaba said the department has finished the report, which lists the causes of long queues, unstable systems, inefficient work flow processes and badly organised communication strategies, which create unhappy clients. He said long queues have been caused by fake news on social media that green barcode IDs will be phased out and people have flooded their offices to get smart card IDs. He called for short-term action. “This includes plans to measure customers’ experiences and waiting times, and testing of one-stop work stations that take fingerprints and photographs.” Gigaba warned office managers to take control of queues or find themselves out of work, saying it was not the guards’ duty. He said they are committed to beating the queues. “This isn’t going to be a quick fix but a process we are committed to, despite budgetary and capacity constraints.”
