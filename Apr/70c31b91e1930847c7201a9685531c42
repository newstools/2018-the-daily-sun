YOUNG people have an opportunity to work from home since the launch of Delft Community Contact Centre in Cape Town.ZaiLab CEO Nour Addine Ayyoub says it will empower previously disadvantaged communities with a state of the art contact centre and training academy.

They won’t have to use money to go out to work,” said Ayyoub.ZaiLab is a next generation software company specialising in contact centre software based in a cloud. Ayyoub said that the accredited training programme covered core competencies including management skills, sales, call centre training and marketing.“We are moving the contact centre outside the city to make it more accessible to employees,” he said.Mzantsi Digital Republic CEO Aubrey Botha said: “This contact centre will provide an opportunity to many youths and business people. We hope they’ll use this to change their lives.”He added that by June this year they hope to have reached 6 000 young people in Delft alone. “This contact centre will help people as it will create jobs closer to home and agents will no longer have to spend money commuting and travelling to find work,” said Botha.Nosiphiwo Ngunguluza (28), one of the young people doing an internship, started last year. As soon as she completes it, she will work from home. She said programmes like these were especially needed in places like Delft, where crime and gangs are common.
