THABONG cops need help to find the family of this madala. According to police spokesman Captain Malebo Khosana, the madala calls himself Peter Marumo. He told cops he is from Ledig in the North West. He came to Thabong, Welkom two weeks ago. “He told police he came to Thabong to visit his three kids and ended up getting lost. He then decided to come to the police station because he had nowhere to go,” said Khosana. He told Daily Sun they’ve called the local radio station for help, but so far no one has come forward. “The madala is having to sleep on the bench at the police station,” he said. Cops are appealing to anyone who might recognise the madala to call Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane on 072 059 7672.
