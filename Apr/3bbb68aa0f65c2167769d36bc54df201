Bulls coach John Mitchell has named his team for Saturday's Super Rugby encounter against the Melbourne Rebels at Loftus Versfeld. Kick-off is at 15:05. Mitchell has made one injury enforced change to the team that thumped the Sharks 40-10 in Durban last weekend. Hanro Liebenberg is sidelined for an extended period with a knee injury which sees Marco van Staden move from flank to No 8, with Roelof Smit taking the No 6 jersey from Van Staden. Shaun Adendorff takes Smit's spot on the bench. Smit, Van Staden and Thembelani Bholi will start together as a loose forward combination for the first time this season, although they did so for most of the match in Durban after Liebenberg left the field injured. “We are back again at Loftus Versfeld and playing in front of our home fans. We have another opportunity to show that we are a team that play until the very end and that is an exciting opportunity for this squad. We are gaining some momentum and are improving all the time. We are not the finished product yet though and hard work and commitment remains important for us," Mitchell said.
