The fight is mainly about the difference in the music we perform. These people are jealous of our success. I don’t know what to do because I don’t have money to build a new house.”The musician said a group of men armed with pangas, spears and bush knives threw stones at his windows last Saturday.“They entered my homestead and kicked down the doors of the other houses before piercing holes in my water tank.“My house is big and I was in a room where I was able to call a friend, who came to my rescue. When the men saw the car they ran in different directions.”Police spokeswoman Captain Edith Mjoko said: “A case of malicious damage to property has been opened at Bizana Police Station. No arrests have been made.”
