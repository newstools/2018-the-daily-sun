AWARD-WINNING actor Warren Masemola could be shaking in his dancing boots while awaiting his next court appearance. This as the 34-year-old actor was nabbed for driving under the influence of alcohol along the N1 Highway in Kroonstad, Free State. Warren, last week crowned the Best Actor at the South African Film and Television Awards for his role in the popular SABC1 dance drama Tjovitjo, ignored the SunTeam’s questions relating to the allegations when contacted for comment.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsshjRYILnj5TtmdBuebN4Yt22VaLyaiVYQxYdsLj8r_FNNil0JxVljXUH8yOc-x1PM_K0-3jUrUG7eeiBWYUsAhpjb4geZ6vnIepnLjEb9StfxJREebzA3ybGWYrXhxDqfyACQ7hJ7WW47SIOYJyxV2vJ6GY4j9TNNt_eg7OLVus3R-74kO8lVbx7i40tEU_KElHGInoYa6tXE0KGzafhDhAdNTq0Dbej-RDstyHsoXy6r2MH15DLlEHgDchekfAJRY1gQHM81wqrDuSZaym2uaMhKRhM9Si5UCLg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCDTFtGo693EEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

As a matter of fact, I’m hanging up the phone.” But two police officers, who were at the scene, painted a different picture.  According to them, blood samples were taken when the actor – who plays maFred – was found to be over the legal drinking limit late last year. “He appeared in the Kroonstad Magistrate Court, where he was told he would be summoned back to court after his blood samples had been analysed,” the informant asserted. The official informed the SunTeam that Warren had told officers at the roadblock that he was heading home and rushing to see his family. “He actually thought the law wouldn’t apply just because he’s a celeb. But it was clear the law applies to all equally.” Police spokesperson Montantsi Makhele confirmed the case. “The case is under investigation because we are still waiting for the Blood Alcohol Report,” the major general said.
