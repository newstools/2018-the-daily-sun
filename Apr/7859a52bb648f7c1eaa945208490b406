Hunky South African actor, model, rapper and presenter Jesse Suntele is set to join Rhythm City next month. After his stint on The Queen Mzansi, the actor is returning to our screens to play Nqaba, Suffocate’s son who was based in Ghana. According to the channel, Nqaba is a charming, intelligent and good looking young man with a good head on his shoulders. “He has clean and sober habits, but he occasionally goes out for a drink with friends or alone after a stressful day. Girls gravitate towards him like bees on honey and he knows it, but he is by no means a player. He simply loves the attention. Despite his charm and laid-back appearance, Nqaba is quick with his fists when provoked - he is, after all, Suffocate’s son,” said e.tv. With the arrival of Nqaba, Suffo will learn that things have not been as they seem to be in Zothile’s house since she revealed that Nqaba was Suffo’s son. However, Saffo allows Nqaba to live with him and Puleng, as long as he promises to stay out of trouble. But being Suffo’s son, Nqaba can’t avoid getting into trouble occasionally, especially because of his quick temper. Catch Jesse Suntele on Rhythm City from the 7th of May on e.tv.
