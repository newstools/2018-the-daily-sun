Two of them were her own children. Mpumelelo Nibe, a little boy aged five and his sister Angel (7), died in the raging fire.This took place early on Friday morning. The kids’ two cousins, Nelisiwe Mqongo (13) and Xolelwa Dyantyi (29), also died in the flamesA family member on the scene, Nomfuneko Ngqoloda (29) told Daily Sun she was sleeping when she heard Xolelwa screaming. “She screamed that someone was pouring petrol on the door of their shack because she heard footsteps and then smelled the strong smell of petrol,” said Nomfuneko. “We saw the fire starting from the door. We tried to put it out but it was very strong. We watched helplessly, listening to the screams for help from inside the shack.”When the fire was finally put out, all four the occupants of the shack were dead.The kids’ mother, Zikhona, said police came and fetched her and her boyfriend from his place and took them to the police station to question them. “My boyfriend told them his nyatsi had threatened to burn him and his family in the past,” she said.The police called the nyatsi and asked where her nearest filling station was. “We went there and viewed the CCTV footage. She was seen buying petrol in a jug and leaving at about 7.15pm on Thursday, the night the shack burnt down,” she claimed. “When she was called to the police station she was still wearing the same clothes seen on the CCTV cameras.“Police arrested her and she has been in the police cells since then.” Zikhona said she was aware of the relationship between her boyfriend and the woman suspect. “He told me he dumped her in December. Since then, she has been threatening to kill us,” she claimed.“My children were innocent. They didn’t deserve to die like this.” Zikhona said she will wait for the woman to be released so she can get her revenge. “I know the law of this country. Soon this woman will be back in the community.” David Maluleke (38), the father of the kids, said he was traumatised. “I am just trying to be strong and find strength.” He said he saw the suspect a day before the incident and she didn’t show any signs. “All l want now is the justice system to bring the full might of the law to bear on her.” City of Joburg EMS spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said officials responded to multiple shacks on fire early on Friday morning. “The cause of the fire is still being investigated,” he said.Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said the suspect will appear in the Alexandra Magistrates Court today.
