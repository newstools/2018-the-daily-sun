KARABO Mokoena’s murder trial resumed at South Gauteng High Court in Joburg yesterday. Social development MEC Nandi-Mayathula Khoza and a group of activists protested outside the court. Karabo’s best friend Stephanie Loang testified against Sandile Mantsoe, Karabo’s boyfriend who is accused of her murder last year. Stephanie told the court she had known Karabo since 2013 and said Sandile’s and Karabo’s relationship was toxic.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>She described an incident that took place on her birthday, when after a night out, Sandile became angry at KFC and grabbed Karabo by the throat. They then went to a hotel, where the couple got into another fight. “They were pushing each other around and shouting at each other. “The accused pushed Karabo as she was holding on to him. She fell back on on the concrete and the accused fell on top of her. He pushed her hard. When she fell, there was a sickening thud.” Stephanie finally left but later learned Karabo had been taken to hospital. She said on 8 May last year, she went to the Sandton Skye Hotel with the cops as Karabo had last been seen there. She was shown surveillance footage to identify Karabo. She said footage of 28 April showed Karabo entering with Sandile but she never came out. Sandile was then seen with rubbish bags, pushing a bin. She said two days later, when she went with cops and Karabo’s family to Sandile’s flat to look for Karabo’s clothes, bloodstains were found on a carpet.
