RESIDENTS were woken by gunshots at 5am yesterday morning. When they peeped out of their windows they saw a security car had been sprayed with bullets. When the cops arrived, they found two security guards had been shot dead and a taxi owner wounded. Residents of Tsakane in Ekurhuleni said the incident happened in Ndaba Street in front of Pholosong Hospital. Police spokesman Sergeant Harry Manaka said: “The incident is suspected to be related to taxi violence. The two security guards were contracted to provide protection to members of the Brakpan Taxi Association. “They had just picked up one of the members of the association and were driving a marked VW Golf 7 GTI when they were attacked by two motor vehicles, a combi and a sedan. “It is alleged the combi drove past the Golf and blocked it from the front while the sedan waited at the back. They started shooting at the occupants of the Golf.” One of the security guards died at the scene while the other was rushed to hospital, but he died on arrival. Manaka said the taxi association official was critically injured and was fighting for his life in hospital. “The motive for the shooting is not known at this point and the suspects are at large,” he said. Police are investigating cases of murder and attempted murder. Anyone who has information is asked to contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
