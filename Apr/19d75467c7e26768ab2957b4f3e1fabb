Fitness bunny Sbahle Mpisane and Kazier Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune’s relationship is apparently going strong. The pair have not been completely open about their relationship saying they were ‘only friends’ on many occasions. However, in light of rumours circulating that suggest their relationship might be a thing of the past, Sbahle has decided to share a slideshow of images on social media that indicates that her relationship with the goalie is still going strong, contrary to what some believe. The slideshow which she simply captioned “I heard it's Monday ??#MCM,” showed some of the couple’s best moments captured in pictures. “We remain strong...not everyone is gonna be happy for you...but it’s so much better to get through life’s BS when you have someone who loves you by your side,” she also said on her Insta stories.
