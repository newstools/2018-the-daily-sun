these wards with a bigger majority. The ANC received 60.38 % in Ward 16 of
Umdoni and also recorded 54.63% in the Ward 03 of Mkhambathini.“These results confirm the people's confidence in the
governing party, the ANC.They are further testament that no other political party
has the proven track record, experience and vision to unite the people of South
Africa and move our country forward. We appreciate the support we continue to
receive from the people of the province,” said Zikalala. The ANC also thanks all its volunteers who ensure that
the ANC remains in contact with the people. Although the ANC lost Ward 2 of Jozini Municipality,
people showed much confidence in the ANC as we continue to make inroads in
northern KZN."The ANC understands that the legacy of apartheid
and its stubborn residual effects of poverty, unemployment, underdevelopment
and inequality remain high amongst many of our people."The ANC therefore does not take for granted the
support it continues to receive and calls on all its elected public
representatives to work hard to resolve our people’s problems.“We congratulate the Independent Electoral Commission
(IEC) for delivering these free, fair and credible by-elections. We equally
express our gratitude to our committed and selfless volunteers who work hard to
ensure that the ANC wins elections."
