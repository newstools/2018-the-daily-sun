But the body of the matric pupil at Nkombose High School has still not been found.Zenzile said ever since her son’s drowning, she hasn’t been able to sleep properly. “I can’t forgive myself. I took him to the beach where he disappeared. “I had just served them lunch and they ran into the water. “After a short while Zamani and Samkelo came running to say Mxolisi had been swept away by a strong wave, and was screaming for help,” said the mum.“I rushed there and I saw him screaming for help and raising his hand.“I called for help from the lifeguards but by the time they arrived, it was too late. “Mxolisi had already disappeared under the water,” said Zenzile.She said even the guards couldn’t jump in as the current was too strong. Zenzile said the next day they went to the beach, but divers were not there to help with the search. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele told Daily Sun: “A missing person’s case is being investigated by Mtubatuba police.”
