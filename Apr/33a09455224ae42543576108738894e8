I don’t have money and the family did not have a funeral policy. I don’t know where I am going to get money to transport the dead and buy the coffins and food for the funeral.” She said she had not yet decided on a date for the funeral because she does not have any money. Silvia said two of Nombulelo’s children were not with their mum when the incident happened. “Even though they survived, their clothes and school uniforms were burnt. “The kids had been on a visit to friends in the area. I am grateful that their lives were saved, but I am worried because they lost all their belongings in the fire.“I do not know what they will wear when schools reopen today,” Silvia told the People’s Paper.She said they suspected that a candle caused the fire, as the area had experienced electricity cuts since Friday. KZN police spokesman Thulani Zwane said an inquest docket had been opened by the Inanda police after four people were killed when their shack caught fire.
