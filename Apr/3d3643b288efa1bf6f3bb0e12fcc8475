Following the loss, Bobby Motaung confirmed at a post match press conference that Komphela will resign with immediate effect. Motaung said: “There has to be a reality check, we are not safe.

"To be honest, I don't think we deserve the results, Komphela said in his postmatch press conference. "But you can't fault the players. So many missed opportunities. "What we saw today is not good for football. It calls for reflection also from my side about this club, about the future.
