Lephoto has been watching lot of Mokoka’s races and he has copied how the 33-year-old does his business in the track. Two weeks ago the teenager was seating in the stands when Mokoka destroyed his field to retain the men’s senior 10 000m title at the Senior Track and Field Championships at the University of Pretoria in Tshwane.Lephoto studied the race and he analysed Mokoka’s every move especially the last part of the race when he started his sprint to show second placed Gladwin Mzazi a clean pair of heels.Lephoto, who is passionate about the sport, said Mokoka is getting old and he will soon retire and he wants to take over the baton when that time comes. On Friday night he will be looking to complete a historic double in the men’s under-20 10 000m and 5000m finals. He will run in the 5000m in an event that he is expected to win. Lephoto said: “My brother Sello Mokoena inspired me when I was eight years old and in 2012 I started to take the sport seriously and my performance started to pick up. Mokoka is my hero. It feels so good to win the race. I used to do steeple chase and 5000m, but now I will do the 10 000m on a regular basis. I loved Mokoka’s 10 000m especially his last 200m sprint.” He went to countries such Uganda, Algeria and Mauritius to take part in the youth African championships and he is growing with each race. He led the race from start to finish “I started to feel that the race was mine and decided to take charge. But the plan was to secure a top 3 finish. I want to be the new Mokoka. I can do it.”
