Host of the SABC 1 emotainment show, Nyan’Nyan, Luyanda Potwana‏ says he owes his current success to the channel for having taken a chance on him. ‘I’m who I am because of SABC 1. I have no TV qualifications - therefore having me as host of one of their biggest shows (Nyan’Nyan), was a huge risk,” he shared. The show deals with real life issues by helping people make confessions to their partners. As host of the show, Luyanda is at the center of helping people mend broken relationships, helping to restore peace, love and happiness in people’s lives. This is his first big gig in the entertainment industry and he couldn’t be more grateful for the opportunity’ “I’m forever grateful for the opportunity...from the gutter to somebody,” he said. The TV presenter also shared a throwback picture of himself, saying that the SABC found him in the “gutter” and have re-shaped his life. “I was at a friend’s (Morgan Mofokeng) house here...homeless & asking for a place to crash. What is born of defeat is PERSEVERANCE, and with it - SURVIVAL! True Kings are made on the fields of failure,” he preached.
