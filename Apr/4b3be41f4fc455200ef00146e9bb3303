Therefore we found the men guilty of vandalising it.”Mkhwanazi said church members have also asked to consult their inkosi, Vukile Shembe. Daily Sun reported on 14 March that church members were angry after the men vandalised their temple by removing holy stones and cutting down trees.Preacher Timothy Mnguni said they were glad the issue was put to rest. “As a leader of the church I was sent by Inkosi Shembe to lead his work in his temple so we can’t say how much the accused must pay. We’ll go to Ekuphakameni some time this week and report what the traditional leaders have said. Then we expect the inkosi to tell us what the men must do or pay for damages,” said Mnguni.
