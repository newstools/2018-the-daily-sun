SHE thought she had finally met the man of her dreams, but it seems she was wrong. Thembi Mbele (34), a mum of four from Zenzele in Springs, Ekurhuleni claimed her lover, Oupa Masemola (33) took R25 000 from her kids’ education fund and her R6 000 sound system. She said she was fooled by love because he promised to pay lobola. Thembi told Daily Sun they met in February last year at a supermarket. “He first asked for money for furniture because his place was empty. He said he was suspended from work and promised to pay back the money when he was reinstated,” she said. She gave him R25 000. Then he claimed his mum in Mpumalanga had died. “He borrowed my sound system because the pastors wanted to play his mum’s favourite songs.” Thembi said Oupa then claimed to have found a job in Mpumalanga. “Since then he has been avoiding my calls.” Oupa said he and Thembi had a loan shark business but it failed and they both lost money. “I never took money claiming my mother was dead. My mum is still alive. I took the sound system because she broke some of my furniture when we were breaking up. But I will return it at the end of this month.”
