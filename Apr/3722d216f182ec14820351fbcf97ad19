RELIGIOUS leaders from different faiths came together to pray on Thursday. Premier David Makhura attended the event at Standard Bank Arena, along with church leaders, sangomas and residents. He said it is important for people to pray together. He said the Constitution was admired across the world because it gives freedom of worship to all religions. But he warned religious leaders not to use churches to enrich themselves. “We’re not saying church leaders must not do business, but it’s wrong to use poor people to enrich yourself,” said the premier. He said churches that force members to eat and drink strange things should be condemned. “As church leaders, each one of you must say no to ungodly practices,” said Makhura. He said churches must help fight corruption and teach people to respect each other. “For many years, churches played a big role in tackling poverty by taking underprivileged people to school.” Makhura said he was also sent to school by a church and many others like him had become leaders. “We need to keep working together as the power of prayer will overcome any troubles,” he said. Reverend Gift Moerane, The South African Council of Churches’ provincial secretary-general, said people should never lose faith in their creator. “There is a God who makes us breathe and we must praise Him,” he said. Enoch Phiri of Restoration Ministries said if people gave their hearts to God, the world would be a better place.
