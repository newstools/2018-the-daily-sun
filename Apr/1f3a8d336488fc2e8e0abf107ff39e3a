"I don't fear anything, I only fear God." These are the words of Cape Town mayor Patricia De Lille as she gets ready for a motion of no confidence against her. The motion will be debated and voted on laterÂ on Wednesday by political parties in the Cape Town metro. Said De Lille: "I have had 25 community meetings this month. none of the community members i engaged with indicated that they have lost confidence in me. This begs the question whether these councillors who say they have lost confidence in me ever consulted with their communities. "Therefore when they vote today they will be representing their jackets and for many of them it will be their own ambition which is the deciding factor on how they vote." De Lille survived a motion of no confidence against her in February. A total of 110 councillors voted NO, with 109 voting YES and three choosing to abstain.
