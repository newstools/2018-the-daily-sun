MEMBERS of the Nazareth Baptist Church’s Thembezinhle faction sang and danced for joy after the High Court ruled in their favour on Friday. The opposing Ebuhleni also sang and danced. They shouted that they still regarded inkosi Mduduzi Shembe as their leader.Judge Isaac Madondo told the court that the majority, consisting of Judge Jerome Mnguni and Judge Poyo Dlwati, found that Judge Achmat Jappie of the Durban High Court had made no mistake in his judgment in October 2016. Jappie ruled then that inkosi Vela Shembe, who died in December, had been the rightful successor of the church following the death of inkosi Vimbeni Shembe in March 2011. The Ebuhleni faction appealed that ruling.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst31wCaTJUU9jE5D41vYAUZwWoKad1vG7XRy0vCsYanGJM9Qx4UFlAZN8gej6Z5QOmT1AQvX_QfyZ3WV42nxjUAQZOI6lFvQcrieCya4IlEFdtxBWq0VRXm_hodsl-UeijB6ZMpN0HbUPJvLdIMVISXSdeY2ieu2VKl39r4wOKrDdq9yswBJg4aATWkmYd0JQLs0j7f61v5H7AGXB-MpZ76QcSZskvcQ5LoNobeJV_ms5tXR7WFiO1tKsDjw-Jzr7xWy6ZUiI6sbXikvsnjI3g-2SJN4pQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIbZc7p9kGAXEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Thembezinhle faction spokesman Slindelo Bhengu said they would wait and see if the Ebuhleni faction would again appeal. The faction is now led by inkosi Phinda Shembe, who was announced the successor in December after inkosi Vela’s death.
