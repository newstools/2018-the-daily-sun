Sphiwe Nkosi said: “These people seem to be worshipping this man rather than God. Not acceptable at all.” The SunTeam tried to contact the prophet, but church spokeswoman Sbongile Memani said she was the person to send queries to. “The people were not worshipping the prophet. They were just receiving an anointing,” she said. Explaining how people ended up at the prophet’s feet, she said: “The prophet was on stage explaining the Bezalel anointing. “We gave him a chair when he wanted to demonstrate. He did not call on anyone to come up to him. People just left their seats and came to touch him.” Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva , chairwoman of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Religious Communities, said that until it was understood that churches should be regulated, pastors would continue to do whatever they wanted.#qp_main1927282 .qp_btna:hover input {background:#00355F!important} #qp_all1927282 {max-width:815px; margin:0 auto;}What do you think about people praying at the Prophet's feet?It is unbiblical, People should Pray to God and not a ProphetIt is correct, People will recieve the anoiting through the man of GodI don't know.Created with BuildQuizzes
