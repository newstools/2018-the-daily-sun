BAFANA Nkosi’s family is desperate to lay him to rest after the 30-year-old from Mamelodi West in Tshwane died at a party on Sunday. While they are still trying to deal with his death, they are faced with the difficulty of burying him. His brother Moses Nkosi (51) said Bafana had no burial society and the family has nothing. “I didn’t know that he had no burial society. We were told he mysteriously died at a party. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssC5GUvWRuGTX_VFv6q0X-F2OuX2fC5Ip0Pspap7KOUy9dwQZnhWdrWhdHA7um8rQuj5mhlhXsd84_Xv9m66g0I3hIyG_pSPclikw8-w0GYrIm9ghVHOiUz95jxMs_bRIR9apw0ao9JRgu-brHSPRRiyfLuoudMfvKz-LCuzP3418RcOt9_AClXD6CyPGbht5lbbwpj71ZXi27o9QUFlCDzlN-4JisjjpwnhWR7Z_imegoeFMJKLI2IK4x-Dcm6VKMY9RT_MHX311FeabuaSUOBqbxz9VQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzG0j6lr4IH1yEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It will be embarrassing for us if he receives a pauper’s burial.” Moses said all they want is a coffin and for a mortuary to store his body. “We don’t mind if we don’t get food.“People understand that families are struggling,” he said. Moses said although they are still puzzled by Bafana’s death, they don’t want to dwell on it. “We will deal with it when we have buried him. “We have to get closure before we can find out if he was killed or not,” he said.
