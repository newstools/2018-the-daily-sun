The Liquor Amendment Bill has been going through the various
processes before being passed into legislation, but will it bring about the
desired, positive changes?The Liquor Amendment Bill is said to be in the cabinet stage
of the process leading up to it being passed into legislation and one of the
major changes he proposed law is to raise the legal drinking age from 18 to
21 years old.#qp_main1929381 .qp_btna:hover input {background:#00355F!important} #qp_all1929381 {max-width:815px; margin:0 auto;}Should the legal drinking age be raised?Yes, Absolutely!No. The current drinking age (18) is fineIt should actually be lowered to 16Created with PollMakerBut will this be effective?if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuw4ohH20Qa-LBEDbaN9_oZTI_ktxe8k9R_J9dX99TJyb-HLLCgLdqb2YXxlQ0RBkiKdmvgw94rpQjJkHn58wLwGAR7hRE4qjbaKROwBc9tC-UClht1i-fax5eK8KDxY94P469IJLbRe1XrxuPt8q7lrl_MnRKDRhx6KVJSv9bTi1VnSI6T7S4dfk12fwFtqugkL1mNFzN0f8eNWKNSf28wHphQHKYrge2PrgvpfvfPgrkgpH3kZVnZUWShtAjTR7sdN1w3fdS9qfw9Z9fyJXdBo3eBoEg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFEit-KE7RAbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

developing until a person has reached their mid-20s. Therefore, alcohol's
effect on brain development was worse among younger people.The University of Rochester's Medical Centre conducted
studies and discovered that in comparison to adults, teenagers process information
with a different part of the brain. Teen brains are believed to process
information with the amygdala, whereas adults process information with the
prefrontal cortex.The prefrontal cortex, also known as the rational part of
your brain or the decision-making centre, doesn't fully develop until you're
about 25 years old.The connections between the emotional part of the brain, the
amygdala, and the decision-making centre, the prefrontal cortex, are still
developing and they don't develop at the same speed. This may explain teenagers
are more emotional than rational at their age.Raise legal drinking age, ban the adsEconomics-based consultancy firm, Genesis Analytics,
conducted a study on the socioeconomic impact, should the laws be passed, and
presented it to the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac)
before they gave the go-ahead for the bill to move further through the
processes.The study showed that one of the pros for raising the legal
drinking age was that it could put a stop to young people in school uniforms
frequenting shebeens.The study, however, also showed that even though the legal
drinking age may be raised, young people would still be able to buy alcohol
where there is no community support for the prohibition of underage alcohol
sales.Alcohol advertising can appeal to young people as well –
from being displayed on many platforms, like television and especially social
media, to concepts used in advertising, such as humour and socialising.Peter Ucko, CEO for the Tobacco Alcohol and Gambling
Advisory Advocacy and Action Group (TAGAAAG), told Health24 that he doesn't
have much faith that the new laws will have much of an effect."Much stricter and more sensible laws should be
implemented. Advertising is an example of where there should be a total ban.
These time restrictions are nonsense, it's worthless and won't have the desired
effect."These laws may curb underage drinking a little, but
government must set the standard like they have with no smoking indoors. After
a while people complied and accepted it. A standard needs to be set that
drinking or getting drunk is not 'cool'."Shebeens do, however, pose a big problem which the
amendments address, but don't solve. Licencing and enforcement must be
strengthened."Change the laws, change the habits?In a 2010 report, the World Health Organization classified
South Africa as a country with a high alcohol consumption – the country was
ranked at 30th out of 195 countries for total alcohol consumed per capita with
11L per person per year. (Belarus was ranked first with 17.5L.)The Director-General of the Department of Trade and
Industry, Lionel October, indicated that the proposed new liquor laws are about
to be finalised at a Parliamentary committee meeting a few weeks ago.According to a report by Huffington Post SA, the Department
of Health (DoH) is calling for a complete ban on alcohol advertising. October
says this means that the process will take longer to finalise.The proposed new law, if passed, bans broadcasting of
alcohol advertisements on radio and television between 6am and 10pm. The legal
drinking age will be raised from 18 years to 21 years.- Health24
