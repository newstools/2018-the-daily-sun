They claimed they are boiling hot in summer, freezing in winter and that the school leaks on rainy days.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvvvhTSb9mU9PM16vJY5UrxQeR6QZfhnZBSKAN-qt6pGfe8qA0-LxK8QpUhLkZbG-u1f-k9mtimkw-iGokaXQ6Ij8y2V7IsaIlsxKnBt-KzlklbFdIUf3HWjXfgsKT4OehKurTQa9rISV4Klq1fBUqg46P454_ajdW5rRBBwDgVHeIfFQNRAPGNlbyM-EokFqF45di5kK8gYqDV06LpU2ff9zWw3bgFIyZRB22jGK0Tqpwd0dPZAO9CPnHvVxGfCXR5hUk_QFOgh3iEZWvwjmaYW0lWjxAB\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCVMD1jH5HreEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

As if that weren’t enough, thugs broke into the school premises on Thursday and beat up three of the guards before tying them up and ransacking the school. They stole all the smart boards.Guard Smanga Ndlazi (58) said the thugs got into the school by jumping over the fence.“We were guarding the school when the thugs stormed in. “My colleague saw the men and pressed the panic button to call the cops.“The men heard the noise from the panic button and became angry. “They started to assault us.” Smanga said the three men insulted them and told them to hand over government resources. “I didn’t know they were talking about smart boards. We have alarms and were told to press them when in danger. “We were told they ring at the police station, only to find out the hard way they are loud enough for thugs to hear them.“They just moered us and tied us up, leaving us bloody.” He said residents found them later.Congress of South African Students chairman Charles Makwakwa told Daily Sun the incident has made pupils feel unsafe on the school premises. “We were still dealing with the issue of the mkhukhu classrooms and now this has happened,” he said. Captain Linkie Lefakane said a manhunt has been launched for the suspects who made off with six smart boards. “We appeal to residents to assist with information that could lead to their arrest,” she said.
