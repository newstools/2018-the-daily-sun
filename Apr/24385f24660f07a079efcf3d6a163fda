MPUMALANGA is becoming a haven for cash-in-transit thugs. And on Monday a heist was caught on CCTV camera which took place at Vector Logistics at Heyneke Street in Nelspruit. Thugs stormed a depot as a cash van was arriving to collect money. Speaking to Daily Sun, Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said no one was injured during the robbery but thugs fled with an undisclosed amount of cash. “It is alleged that the vehicle was followed by two cars,” she said. Sekgotodi said when the vehicle entered the premises, the thugs followed and forced the vehicle to stop. They fired shots and ordered the guards to move inside the offices on the premises. “As soon as they had loaded the money into their cars, they fled,” said Sekgotodi. Anyone with information should call Brigadier Obed Ngwenya on 082 565 6417 or SAPS on 08600 10111. VIDEO: LOWVELDER.CO.ZA  Meanwhile, three other incidents have happened in the area.
