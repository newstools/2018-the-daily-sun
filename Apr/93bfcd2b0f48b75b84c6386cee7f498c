A bus carrying international tourists who had been on a wine
tour was stoned as it headed to the Cape Town International Airport at the
weekend, View Africa Coach Charter said on Monday. The charter company's depot manager Pieter Uys said the bus
driver was travelling from Franschhoek on the N2 on Saturday when the vehicle
was targeted between the Airport Approach Road and Borcherds Quarry offramps. "Some guys threw stones at the bus, breaking two
windows and damaging side panels," Uys said. "Our driver went on to the airport and the tourists got
off in a hurry. No one was injured." It was not immediately clear what the motive was. However, Uys said some of the company's drivers were wary to
enter certain "hotspots" since the start of a nationwide bus strike
on April 18. When tourists had to be dropped off at the airport, drivers
tried to use alternative routes, he said. Western Cape police spokesperson, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana,
confirmed a case of malicious damage to property was opened but no arrest had
yet been made. Tourists stranded Last Tuesday, a tour bus was attacked near the Castle of
Good Hope in Cape Town, said Cape Town law enforcement spokesperson Wayne
Dyason. "Some of the strikers saw the bus and insisted that the
driver join the strike," he said. A group hit the windows of the bus, took the keys from the
driver and then threw them away. "The tourists were stranded so law enforcement stepped
in to transport them to their hotels." Elwierda coach charter company owner Wikus van Niekerk told News24
the company's buses were still operating at every depot across the country. "At this stage we don't have any incidents." The bus strike is set to enter its third week on Wednesday. SOURCE: NEWS24
