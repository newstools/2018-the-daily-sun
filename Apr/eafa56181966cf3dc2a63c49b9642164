I sometimes slaughter them and sell or eat the meat,” said Duma.“This section of the township has always been filthy. People are jealous that I’m trying to improve my life.”He said nobody has ever complained before.“I will not stop my piggery,” he said.The municipality’s spokeswoman, Nqubeko Ngcobo, said it was against municipal by-laws to start a business in a residential area without having the site assessed and approved by the municipality.“Our environmental health unit will investigate the matter. The property owner will be punished should he be found not to be complying with the by-laws,” she said.Pietermaritzburg SPCA manager Ronnie Yeoman said they were not aware of the matter. He asked for the address so he could investigate.
