SECURITY guards for the Molweni Taxi Association outside Pinetown, west of Durban, are in hot water. A video showing them discharging firearms in a residential area has gone viral on social media. The shots are believed to have been fired at Mbhekaphansi Village on Saturday during a funeral, as a 21-gun salute of sorts.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstD979heNYlbSEzbBVLAvPm5cJGP6iki8D39HJzGlNdZSybtYfqiHUbeLwAkrfpYIa5dr6qh_go2UIZF6n9YjJPQGGUqOcvEOCeGRonVUNAvZEuL3kstK-vNLpd5vwSkw75FPXq1W_l2rZRbH3rvwydsxmUYKbNGzSCH0nEn0KqRp8EsdAsp6mxRPS1THZGpyBBDBWETZdp1_zawZ9zeFdjJ5OMKJQZxZbYlFPHTsP1F00fmYurP9gcaTP4VoEje3QrOuD4zW84fcsgnB6oECvHiSrWrKk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFHPLmW8_bJuEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They will appear in the Pinetown Magistrates Court soon.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “Their firearms, suspected to have been used during the shooting, were taken for ballistic tests.”In the video, the three men are seen travelling in a double-cab bakkie branded with a Taxi Violence Protection Unit logo. They’re seen taking turns firing shots in the air on a road not far from people’s homes. Loud screams are heard in the background! A fuming resident, Nonhlakanipho Mazibuko (43), said: “Discharging a firearm in a residential area is totally unacceptable. “People could have got hurt or died. These men must be jailed.”Molweni and Merebank Taxi Association chairman Fano Shezi confirmed the men worked as security guards for the association. He said they were off duty. “The man who was being buried was not a member of the association.“So the security guards went to the funeral in their personal capacity. “We’re very sorry to the residents about what happened. “We no longer want them and have requested their company to replace them.”
