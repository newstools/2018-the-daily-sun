THREE days before her death, Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela attended church, on Good Friday. Reverend Refilwe Tawana of the Wesel Methodist Church in Meadowlands, Soweto, said her death came as a huge shock to everyone. “On the day she was at church, Mama never showed any signs of illness. In fact, she looked better than on other days.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuWQwjJoA64BCwGAHW_w5oBXXVduZGQ4OHpJnOAnulaoteCxqEM0SNk7qhTnPfKfnuRExUgWx7UnOdEEB5E0o0Pt4GRyPBOGvroEAKmGVJuhVSCD2IpBBJONk0-hBjdL0TCVfwHHjuZ3WUziTNCgXTndcTwRlC1Iqe4YJo86jiIbn29uiOhJ2bXCwLYNKbGszNyedx10nx2GM92JLGt9eMcoUcgUtyC9hlHcYsKW9Qn5mW8c5Tii_RT491mIb4YQHQ88833y_eBZzco-LUxVcnTDC8jXlrU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFcjUvYtOtduEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

She donated a cow every Easter,” he said.The reverend said the nation had lost a true leader and he would always remember her for her good heart and love of the people. “Every time she arrived, she would hug and kiss everyone. I knew when she came, I would get a hug and a kiss.” He said last year, after a number of women were killed, Mama Winnie organised a prayer session at Dobsonville Stadium. “Different churches and taxi owners were there. It was great. “That alone showed Mama cared for us as a nation,” he said. The reverend said the church was planning her memorial service on Sunday but were still waiting for confirmation from the family. “We pass our deepest condolences to the family and the nation as a whole.” Madikizela-Mandela, who was known around the world for her fight against apartheid, died at Netcare Milpark Hospital on Monday, aged 81. She had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year and died peacefully, surrounded by family and loved ones. Her funeral service will be held at Orlando Stadium on 14 April.
