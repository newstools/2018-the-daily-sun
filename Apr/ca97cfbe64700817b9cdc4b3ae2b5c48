T hato  wanted to buy a house for his family, but didn’t earn enough to get a bond. His friend, Sizwe, said he should buy a new RDP house instead. This because they are much cheaper and you don’t need a bond to get one. Azikhiphi! That’s not on! Thato should not listen to his friend, as he’s wrong. RDP houses are built by the government for families who can’t afford their own. You can’t buy them new. Thato called SCORPION LEGAL PROTECTION to get legal assistance and advice. Who qualifies for an RDP house? To qualify, you must: These conditions can change at any time though, and you should contact your provincial housing department for the latest qualifying criteria. Buying, selling and renting an RDP house You may not sell or rent out your RDP house to make profit. The Housing Amendment Act says you can sell your RDP house after eight years, but if you sell it before the eight-year period has prescribed, the money from selling the house must go back to the Department of Human Settlements. If you can afford your own house, then you need to let the local municipality know, so it can give the RDP house to someone who really needs it. If you have to pay for it, it’s a scam. RDP houses are given to people who qualify and can’t be bought. You can only buy an RDP house from someone after they’ve had it for eight years or more. If someone tells you to pay a fee to get into the waiting list, watch out, it’s a scam. You don’t need to pay, and paying a fee won’t “bump” you up on the list. Instead, deal directly with the housing department in your province. How can Scorpion help Thato?
