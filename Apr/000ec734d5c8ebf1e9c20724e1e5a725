SERIOUS injuries to six-year-old Refilwe’s foot were just the beginning of her nightmare. Her mum Silindile Biyela (33) of KwaMashu, KZN said they were coming home from church when a truck crashed into them on Sunday, 1 April. “Refilwe was rushed to Newtown A Community Health Centre in Inanda with an injured foot, which was stitched up. “She was then transferred to Mahatma Gandhi Hospital the same day.” But according to the mum, the treatment Refilwe received at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Phoenix, Durban just made things worse. The angry mum has demanded that the KZN Health Department must take action against the nurses. She blames them for her daughter’s condition. She said they arrived at the hospital in the afternoon and spent the night on a bench because nurses told them all the beds were occupied. Silindile said they hoped that on the Monday morning they would get a bed, but they spent that day waiting on a bench as well. Her daughter was eventually given a bed and her foot was bandaged so that, according to nurses, the wound could drain. But on the Tuesday, when nurses removed the bandages, the stitches were ripped open. “They left her with her wound still open. On the Wednesday a doctor checked the wound and found it had worms,” she claimed. “Nurses tried to treat her, but on the Saturday they told us the treatment had failed, so they transferred her to Addington Hospital where she is currently being treated. “At Addington they managed to stop the worms.” Health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said the department is concerned about the allegations but they cannot discuss confidential information or management of a patient with a third party. “The department has asked for a report from the management of the hospital about the management of the patient so this can be reviewed internally,” Mafunda said.
