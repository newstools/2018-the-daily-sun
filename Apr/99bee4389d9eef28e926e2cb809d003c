THE man at the centre of corruption allegations and the collapse of health services in the North West will be taken to a disciplinary hearing. Dr Thabo Lekalakala, HOD of health, will face the music after the portfolio committee on health in the province questioned whether he undermined the MEC, Dr Magome Masike, and reported directly to premier Supra Mahumapelo. On Tuesday Mahumapelo’s spokesman, Brian Setswambung, confirmed that forensic investigations relating to the Mediosa medical mobile unit transfer in the department of health had been concluded. “The forensic report, which has found some irregularities, was today handed over to the MEC for health, Dr Masike, for implementation of the recommendations. “The report recommends disciplinary proceedings against the HOD and other implicated officials.” Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi said Lekalakala should be fired. When asked for a comment on the DC, Lekalakala said: “I will go to the hearing and hear what their issues are.”
