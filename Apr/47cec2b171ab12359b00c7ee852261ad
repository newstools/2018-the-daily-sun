She said the driver of the hijacked truck reported his hijacked truck to the Magaliesburg police.“Investigations revealed that the truck in the collision was the hijacked one,” she said. “Quick thinking police officers immediately called ahead to the hospital and with the assistance of colleagues from Krugersdorp, the injured driver was found at the hospital. “He is under arrest after a device believed to be used in jamming signals was found in his possession.”The 25-year-old suspect has been charged with hijacking, possession of stolen property and possession of implements believed to be used in the hijacking of motor vehicles. “The cargo, estimated at approximately R2 million, was recovered and handed back to the rightful owner,” said Ernst.
