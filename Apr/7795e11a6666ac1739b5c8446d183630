The multi-million-rand aircraft at the centre of a legal dispute between Gupta owned businesses, an Ireland based aircraft company and the Canadian government, has apparently been returned to Lanseria airport.The Guptas had a lease agreement with Export Development Canada (EDC) and Stoneriver for the Bombadier Global 6000 aircraft but are currently engaged in a legal dispute in UK courts over the agreement.Last month the High Court issued an interim order that the aircraft, with a listing price of $60.5 million, (R731 million), be held at Lanseria pending the outcome of the UK court proceedings.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuwdl6b-LSL5gfAmC1IdnDl5bH69EOhtXYeEWBOQ1vN4cjp_96DQ-XsBV3VeAILHUH_qg0O2cPJlHPvYLrUU3xpO53_vwRgFIU0rhQGYPANmf_saashQ9XsaLP9oA6Pnzjk81Bh-JtIU92z9v0hn5hqbGtXos3QdqfJoFZ0sy3dZfd8VBoC24Mipf6f6KZ2QKoYPq5S93su-rJmV0L2X9bpQ-NhbZySv3EkMk_76FO5BD2gs9WaSkBlmaAjs1vbEUAmNaENXQ_YaRc3sk4XZj_0vQYkiHtp\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMzjS36iNUDCEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Weiner also reported police had also boarded the aircraft and were seen carrying bags.The plane, which has its own parody account on Twitter, also confirmed it’s return, and appeared to be disappointed that it had not received a bigger welcome party on its arrival.
