Mzansi comedian Trevor Noah has once again caught the attention of billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates after the launch of his foundation. The recently launched Trevor Noah foundation aims to empower orphans and vulnerable youth by equipping them with quality education, the necessary life skills and social capital after completing high school. Bill Gates , who himself is very passionate about changing people’s lives for the better  is on a mission to end Malaria and has reportedly invested around $1 billion to help come up with solutions to put an end to the scourge of the disease. The  62 year-old founder of Microsoft, took to Twitter to congratulate his favourite comedian on the launch of  his foundation. “Congrats @Trevornoah on the launch of your foundation. I can’t wait to see what you accomplish,” he tweeted. In true Trevor Noah style, the Daily Show host sarcastically replied “Thank you Bill. You handle malaria I'll figure out schools.”
