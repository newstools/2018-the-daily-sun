SunWheels has already reported that BMW's future is electric, and now the Bavarian brand has unveiled their latest model to champion the electric future. The BMW iX3 concept is the Bavarian brand's first core model to have a fully electric drive. ALSO READ: THE FUTURE IS ELECTRIC! The iX3 concept features a motor that delivers 200-kW and a range of 400-kilometres. The iX3 is obviously based on the new X3, which has received rave reviews from motoring journalists worldwide. It features a new grille that is seriously giving me Kia vibes. It is not a serious departure from the X3 design. The visual upgrades are all thanks to the drive train, the grille is shut because the engine doesn't need any ventilation. There are no exhaust pipes at the back because... you guessed it;  the motor doesn't have any emissions. BMW has not forgotten about its combustion engine roots though. The new M2 Competition Package is also making its way to Auto China Beijing 2018.
