If you thought that the entertainment industry is all glitz and glam, then let Riky Rick remind you of how much artists go through. We have all heard countless stories of up and coming entertainers having to go through the most while pursuing their dreams. These artists often have to go homeless, jobless and hungry while they push to get their work noticed. As one of Mzansi’s best known rappers, Riky is no stranger to working from the bottom up. The Stay Shining hit-maker has sent a shoutout to Da L.E.S for having taken him in when he had nothing to his name. “My brother @2freshLES. You and your mom let me sleep at your house when I didnt have a place. Gave me food and a job when I needed it. Showed me what family means. Thank you bro. Thank you,” Riky tweeted.
