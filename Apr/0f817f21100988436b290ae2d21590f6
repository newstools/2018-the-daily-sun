RESIDENTS of Motherwell NU1, Port Elizabeth are gatvol. They blame people from the nearby squatter camp for dumping rubbish in a storm water drain on Indlovu Street. But the squatters said they don’t have a place to throw their rubbish. A Motherwell said life has become unbearable since the squatters moved into the area in December. “We live in an unhealthy environment. Kak and dead animals are being dumped everywhere. “A stormwater drain near the squatter camp is full of rubbish. We are afraid to approach the squatters because most of them are violent.” Another resident said: “The burning of rubbish results in air pollution and it becomes difficult to breathe. “We have elderly people in our street who suffer from asthma.” Squatter Anele Marko (43) said the municipality should provide a dump for them. “The municipality has failed to give us houses. That’s why we have occupied this land. “No one should complain because we also have a right to own land, just like people who live in proper homes.” Mthubanzi Mniki, a spokesman for Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, said: “We clean every part of the metro. “The rubbish accumulates in places that have been illegally occupied. “But how can we supply sanitation on land that has been illegally occupied?”
