AN air of panic is hovering over Kaizer Chiefs Village.Not only do they fear for their lives at the stadium, but they wonder whether they will still be employed at the end of the current season. This comes after the club vowed to overhaul the engine of the malfunctioning Amakhosi machine. Chiefs’ technical team had to run for cover this past weekend as their supporters went wild, throwing an assortment of objects at coach Steve Komphela after their 3-0 league loss to Chippa United. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuISW9cKmNaXmHIX6YmCmnqVY6EQ12wrH-oXd20hju9dYKXATiDHq1RCpWqaCtTIx5LxwqiXBHjtEUEMKic3So_NbxYMcz1k_rSc33RHSzIvPziL1eLQ_vsE3WknGsnBAt07D0IDc_F6VnTGXdcx3k4c5XN4VpLjCBOFEZFCKN-ltW5WH60Aksb3TlmFcQ742-jaD6qEfAqvG1sZcKV_vc-7og1xAUDaorDsvdVrR1_cidmDv-UjuodA5H9RdgCWCVCrTWbZrWy1Q197eNQZny_fg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzL5HXHHm0SEUEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They vowed to make “decisive changes to be implemented at the end of the season to remedy the situation”.Chiefs defender Philani Zulu disagrees with the planned changes and has the view that, as players, they have done enough to secure their jobs at the end of the season.“I hope we maintain the same squad. We’ve gelled quite well and have a lot of quality and depth inthe squad. With the youngsters coming in and the help of senior players we are a good team.”Veteran midfielder Willard Katsande admits he is concerned that they could find themselves jobless next season.Said Katsande: “I have seen this thing (overhaul) happen since coming here. When they hired us to play for Chiefs, we knew there would be consequences if things are not going according to plan.“It’s painful for colleagues to lose their jobs because we are breadwinners (at home). But at the same time we need the club to be competitive, so it’s up to management to take that step.”However, the 32-year-old emphasised that winning their remaining four league games, starting with a date with relegation-haunted Platinum Stars at the same venue on Sunday (3pm), would help restore their pride.He went on: “All we need to do now is focus on finishing strong in the four league games to try and get a spot in the Caf Champions League, and do well in the Nedbank Cup against Free State Stars next Saturday to try and win one trophy. Whatever happens when the season’s over, we will take it like professionals.”Katsande hopes the management will give them another chance to prove their worth instead of making wholesale changes next season. “We’ve had some shortfalls in terms of converting chances. We had new kids on the block trying to learn the culture of the club. We’re a changed club compared to three seasons ago. I think the youngsters have grown.”He says he has made peace with the fact that he too will one day have to make way for new recruits.
