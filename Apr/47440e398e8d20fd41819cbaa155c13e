Rapper Nadia Nakai is a #StyleCrush for her unique, sexy, playful style. There's almost this unwritten law of how rappers are supposed to dress. Rappers style are derived from the Hip Hop culture, and you can see that's where Nadia gets her style inspiration from. She's super confident, fun and bubbly - judging by the way she dresses. She's not afraid to show her skin and play around with colour. Nadia's greatest asset is her hair. She always has the best hairstyles and hair colour that not everyone can pull off. Her hair plays as an accessory to every outfit. She is unique in the fashion game in the industry as nobody dresses like her. You can see that she loves to experiment with her style and doesn't take herself too seriously - which is what fashion is all about.
