DEPUTY president David Mabuza stood his ground in parliament yesterday as opposition MPs attacked him on several fronts. Mabuza toldthem that, with the state capture inquiry about to start, government won’t spare anyone found to be on the wrong side of the law. EFF MP Hlengiwe Mkhaliphi said the Guptas looted mines in Mpumalanga while he was premier. She said the Guptas paid for Mabuza’s flight to Russia. Mkhaliphi asked Mabuza if, as leader of government business in parliament, he would work to bring the Guptas to book. Mabuza said Mzansi had institutions that were qualified and able to hold accountable those at odds with the law. “It’s not the deputy president who should go after people and arrest them,” he said. DA MP Natasha Mazzone asked Mabuza if a warrant of arrest has been issued for former SAA chair Dudu Myeni for ignoring a summons to appear before parliament. Mabuza said it was not his job to do that.
