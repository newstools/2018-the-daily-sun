Dear MizzB My girlfriend is HIV-positive and I’m negative. We always use protection when having sex but last week she told me she wanted to have a baby.   She said we should stop using protection. She’s healthy and her CD4 count is strong. I don’t know what to do as I don’t want to be infected.  Help me. I love her.  Dear Mr Love You are wise to take precautions. The truth is having unprotected sex is a risk. Even if her CD4 count is strong it doesn’t mean her viral load is absent. Infection is still a possibility. Consult your clinic or doctor on prevention methods such as pre-exposure prophylaxis. Continue to use condoms. For more information send a #plzcall to 083 323 1023 or email mizzb@lovelife.org.za
