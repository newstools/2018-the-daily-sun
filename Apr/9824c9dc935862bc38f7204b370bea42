The man who recorded a video of a relaxed Ajay Gupta in
Dubai last week has apparently been arrested, seemingly for filming without
permission.Department of International Relations and Cooperation
spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya said its consular services section confirmed that
South African businessman Justin van Pletzen's mother had made contact and that
she claimed her son had been arrested in Dubai."The SA Embassy in Dubai was not aware of the arrest
and has been requested to confirm this with local authorities there. We are
still awaiting the report from the embassy."if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssvEUds1ytlCmUYOYk3KJBT1efUpmA29XZtlbOCXm9wP0IB0cqRRgMRHoT2WKICoulR3DBVwwmPExvpRMaaxLZZe3xNS-_hgTWnyk-HgYUtBHHK6ZS6Lx_bPM9g1M2EODhl2osgFYgJWzFKbp6YhCLSxHiHgz7NTE7O_t4JUvGuFy-t65uLF-lTa_Fz_DO8btffuPBHqSYJgMIKkVvXFlPrv3Vz7_v8J1p22PBjGMAgxjaQDWn8_EvVjlxzciPWmC1I9dQdyd16Mz3iy5xjUh-pog0VxTIF\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLNRpCcAjsaeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

News24 and said the family would wait for further details from his court
appearance.The video recording which Van Pletzen took shows him asking Gupta
if he would return to South Africa."The country's looking for you," he said.Gupta, who shook Van Pletzen's hand, replied that South
African authorities had not yet given him "a reply"."The day they give a reply, I'll go there," Gupta
added.Theft and fraudThe Hawks have not yet revealed what Gupta is wanted for and
only said that the charges were not related to the Estina Dairy Farm project in
Vrede in the Free State.On February 14, the Hawks conducted raids at various
locations in connection with investigations into the Estina dairy farm project
in Vrede, Free State.They arrested eight people, who were later granted bail in
the Bloemfontein Regional Court.State officials Peter Thabethe, Sylvia Dlamini and Takisi
Masiteng were each granted R10 000 bail.Gupta-linked suspects Varun Gupta, Ronica Ragavan, Nazeem
Howa and Ashu Chawla were each granted R200 000 bail, while Estina director
Kamal Vasram was granted bail of R100 000.According to the charge sheet, the accused face 12 charges, including
theft, fraud, conspiracy to commit theft and fraud.After the publication of the footage, Hawks spokesperson
Hangwani Mulaudzi said it was up to the investigating officer to find ways to
bring Gupta - who is considered a fugitive from justice - back into the
country.SOURCE: NEWS24
