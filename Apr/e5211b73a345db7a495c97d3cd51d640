TONIGHT’S Absa Premiership match between Ajax Cape Town and Baroka FC at Athlone Stadium (7.30pm) might be regarded as a tedious clash. But in truth, the result from this clash at 9.20pm tonight could decide Platinum Stars’ fate. Stars are due to host AmaZulu at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace tomorrow. But the Rustenburg match could prove to be an anticlimax, as by then Dikwena could have already been relegated to the National First Division (NFD) for finishing 16th in the table. Victory over Baroka will take Ajax to 31 points in the standings, beyond Dikwena’s reach, as the latter will only be able to finish the season on 30 points – should they win their remaining three matches. Surely the Ajax and Baroka clash will be closely watched by those who care in Rustenburg and Roger de Sa is bound to be keeping his fingers crossed that the result goes their way. Should Ajax triumph by four goals or more without conceding, the result would push them to 12th place, leapfrogging Polokwane City and SuperSport United – who are both in action tomorrow – and Golden Arrows. In light of this match’s importance, Baroka caretaker coach Macdonald Makhubedu has warned his charges to have their guard up at all times against Ajax. “Don’t underestimate them because they are struggling and in a relegation position,” Makhubedu told his troops. Ajax, under the tutelage of experienced Muhsin Ertugral, will be fighting for their lives and would want to condemn Dikwena to the NFD. “They can be very dangerous,” he said. “I expect them to come at us from the start but we will handle them.” Sad news for Ajax is that they will be without the services of young striker Fagrie Lakay due to suspension. “Ajax can’t afford to lose and neither can we. We want to secure a top eight spot as soon as possible.” The Limpopo side is currently ninth with 33 points and have three matches left to end the 2017-2018 season.
