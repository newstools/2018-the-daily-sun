KAIZER Chiefs defeated Platinum Stars 1-0 in an Absa Premiership encounter at the FNB Stadium on Sunday afternoon.Under-fire Chiefs coach Steve Komphela confessed that it has been a tough week for Amakhosi and may well have confirmed his imminent departure in his post-match interview after defeating struggling Stars.Komphela admitted he wouldn’t be the diamond he was if it hadn’t been for the hardships he went through in his nearly three-year stint with Chiefs that is coming to an end in June.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvvDFZm7AGDMBT2_dJ0uvHfgGd8Xz03by-fxyEzrPu43bVwopqJpbVZtKo3ycBRHbrUMax7ThrnfO0uXhMsH31IrEshNveapf5UgJOVoi3KNbRnduS9PiQk8yHSVMn1iVsGOEj2y6UL9_kYAbmw8v7qunXPHZy18f4XRIWgmG3yJTatOmPYYuK5v4LiZwa9Ln5b1dZ3gOFhlt61J_1PGyAvJi_gCrNtycbU-l4E9LDj4KGa6wdHxhoE-mhVQipCKaxWHqYu-EfUASVnX6_bYA8o7g4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHDYcT97S7QwEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I couldn't have been the coal that I am, I would not have been the diamond that I am, I would have stayed the simple muddy house. "As I go out, I must thank everybody""It is through pressure that you get better but you must accept pressure because at the back of not accepting it you denying God what he want, he's preparing me for another environment. So don't say no to challenges."Added Komphela: "Strength wise I have grown immensely I'm not the same coach who came here, as I go out I must thank everybody. The pressure you receive makes you a better person. Emotionally I was very weak as a person but ask me now, you even ask your self how does this guy stand."Beyond the bit of brains that was given to us, the emotions are stronger and that moves deeper into the level of faith. Maybe I need to be more faithful and the only way to be more faithful you have to have emotions that are stronger and stable. I'm where I am because of them and I thank them so much."Pule Esktein second half goal was enough to secure the maximum points for Amakhosi which will go a long way in boosting their confidence after last weekend 3-0 thumping by Chippa United.Chiefs next match they will face Free State Stars in the semi-final of Nedbank Cup at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday.
