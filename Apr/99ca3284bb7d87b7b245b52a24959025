THEY have closed the school because they believe their children’s lives are in danger. Nombali Ntsindane, SGB chairwoman at Khayeka Primary School in Umzimkhulu on the KZN South Coast, took her kids out of school after the Easter break. The roofs of some of the classrooms are broken and windows haven’t been fixed for about two years. Apparently, parents have been speaking to the education circuit managers about it since last year but were told there was no money to fix the school. “Two officials came before the Easter holidays and promised to helps us, but nothing happened so we decided to close it until the school was fixed. “We’re worried about our kids’ education, but their lives are more important.” Nombali said they were shocked when they heard about the child at an Eastern Cape school who drowned in a pit toilet last month. She said their school toilets were like pigsties and are disasters waiting to happen. Another parent said they didn’t want to wait for a kid to die before they acted, so they closed the school before the roof fell in on the kids. “We’re also going into the winter season. “Kids will get sick because windows are broken. We also fear the roofs will be blown off and fall on the kids.” Spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana has asked the district director to intervene.
